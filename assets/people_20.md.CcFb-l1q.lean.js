At its peak in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Cypress was among the largest US private equity firms, although by the end of the decade the firm would find itself in the process of winding down its operations.Cypress Group Faces Vote For Survival. New York Post, August 7, 2009 The firm, based in New York City, was founded in 1994 by the four senior members of Lehman Brothers' merchant banking group, Jim Stern, Jeff Hughes, Jamie Singleton and David Spalding.Lehman, Seeking Higher Profit, Returns to Merchant Banking. New York Times, November 12, 1996 Cypress has raised approximately $3.6 billion since its inception across two funds raised in 1996 and 1999. History The Cypress Group was founded in 1994 by Jim Stern, Jeff Hughes, Jamie Singleton and David Spalding, who had served previously as the senior managing directors of Lehman Brothers' merchant banking group. The four founders were responsible for restarting Lehman's merchant banking efforts after the departure of Pete Peterson and Stephen A.

The Cypress Group raised its first institutional private equity fund in 1996 with $1.05 billion of investor commitments.Cypress Closes Funds. New York Times, February 22, 1996 In 1999, the firm completed fundraising for Cypress Merchant Banking Partners II, with $2.5 billion of investor commitments. At the time it was raised, the firm's new fund ranked among the largest raised for leveraged buyout transactions. Ultimately, Cypress II would prove to be the firm's final fund when it announced in 2007 that it would abandon further plans to raise a successor fund.Winding down at Cypress Group. Wall Street Journal, June 18, 2007 Cypress had indicated its intentions to raise $1.5 billion. However, a series of weak investments, particularly in Cypress II, severely impacted the firm's plans to raise a third fund. By 2007, Cypress had lost a significant number of its senior investment professionals. As of 2009, the firm is still managed day-to- day by two of its original founders, Jim Stern and Jeff Hughes. David Spalding assumed a role at his alma mater Dartmouth College and Jamie Singleton still remains on the firm's board. In October 2009, the firm's Cypress Merchant Banking Partners II will reach the end of its original 10-year term. While the firm is seeking to extend the life of the fund, investors in the fund are currently negotiating an orderly wind-down of the investments in the portfolio.Fate of Cypress Group Said to Be in Investors‚Äô Hands.

It is a cobblestone building dating to the 1830s. At the time of its construction it was a stagecoach stop on the busy east-west route paralleling the Lake Ontario shoreline. It remained in use as an inn into the mid-20th century despite the loss of stagecoach traffic to the railroads in the decades after its construction. It is believed to be the largest cobblestone building in the state. In 2007 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Building The inn is located on the northwest corner of the junction of Route 104 and Oak Orchard River Road (Orleans County Route 53). It is roughly west of where the highway crosses the Oak Orchard River, and thus the ground around it slopes gently eastward. The building itself is on a graded lot, elevating it slightly above the intersection. There are houses to the west along either side of the road and woods to the east as it slopes to the river. The building itself is a two-story L-shaped structure seven bays on the long leg, paralleling Oak Orchard River Road, and four on the short. It is faced in cobblestones, five rows per Medina sandstone quoin, with a hipped roof pierced by a single central brick chimney with stepped parapet walls at the north and west ends. There is a wide plain frieze below the overhanging eaves. Besides the quoins, the sills, lintels, and water table are all sandstone as well. On the east side are two modern wooden porches at entrances along that wall. There is visible evidence of the roofs that once sheltered both. From the main entrance on the south wall a long central entrance hall runs north to a long four-bay room and then ends in a group of service-related rooms. The second floor has, in addition to its small guest rooms, a similar room in that space. The interior retains much of its original plaster and Greek Revival woodwork. The main staircase has its original stringers, newels and balustrade. History There is little documentation of the building's history. The arrangement of the cobblestone facing is consistent with the middle period of the style, 1836‚Äì1845. The interior layout with the large public dining room on the first floor (probably expanded later on by removing a few rooms) suggests the inn did a lot of business on a competitive stage route. It is believed to be the largest cobblestone building of the hundreds documented in New York. Traffic on the stage routes declined first with the opening of the Erie Canal to the south, and then the rise of the railroads in the mid-19th century. The inn survived by becoming primarily a restaurant, and saw its business revive in the days of automobile tourism in the 1920s in that capacity. In the mid-20th century, that business declined when the New York State Thruway was built to the south in Genesee County. After being vacant for a while, the inn was converted into a residence. It has remained in that use, with no alterations, since then. The Inn was also recently featured in the television show The Dead Files. Episode name, Drawn to Evil, season 10, episode 6. Current owners claim a serious haunting and the show goes into detail about the Inns long history.

Built by the General Services Administration, it is a prime example of Brutalist architecture. The structure is named for Dr. Robert C. Weaver, the first Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the first African American Cabinet member. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 26, 2008. Accessed 2013-12-25. Building conception In 1962, President John F. Kennedy established the Ad Hoc Committee on Federal Office Space and charged it with developing new guidelines for the design of federal office buildings.Gutheim and Lee, Worthy of the Nation, 2006, p. 410. On May 23, 1962, the Ad Hoc Committee issued a one-page report, Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture, which established these new design principles. The document encouraged federal planners to consider and build structures that \\"reflect the dignity, enterprise, vigor and stability of the American National Government\\" and \\"embody the finest contemporary American architectural thought.\\"\\"An Eyeful of Washington Eyesores,\\" Washington Post, December 21, 2008. In 1965, major revisions to federal housing policy resulted in the creation of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The United States Congress passed and President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 on August 10, 1965, which President Johnson called \\"the single most important breakthrough\\" in federal housing policy since the 1920s.Semple, \\"$7.5 Billion Bill, With a Rent Subsidy Proviso, Signed by Johnson,\\" New York Times, August 11, 1965. The legislation greatly expanded funding for existing federal housing programs, and added new programs to provide rent subsidies for the elderly and disabled; housing rehabilitation grants to poor homeowners; provisions for veterans to make very low down- payments to obtain mortgages; new authority for families qualifying for public housing to be placed in empty private housing (along with subsidies to landlords); and matching grants to localities for the construction of water and sewer facilities, construction of community centers in low-income areas, and urban beautification.Pritchett, Robert Clifton Weaver and the American City: The Life and Times of an Urban Reformer, 2008, p. 256-259. Just four weeks later, on September 9, President Johnson signed legislation establishing the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.Pritchett, Robert Clifton Weaver and the American City: The Life and Times of an Urban Reformer, 2008, p. 262. Design work on the future HUD building began immediately. Karel Yasko, Assistant Commissioner for Design and Construction in the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), oversaw the design process in accordance with the Ad Hoc Committee's guidelines.Gutheim and Lee, Worthy of the Nation, 2006, p. 301. In 1946, the Congress had passed the District of Columbia Redevelopment Act, which established the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency and provided for clearance of land and redevelopment funds in the capital.Committee on the District of Columbia, Amend Redevelopment Act of 1945..., 1978, p. 112. After a decade of discussion, public comment, and negotiations with landowners and developers, the Southwest Urban Renewal Plan was approved in November 1956.Committee on the District of Columbia, Amend Redevelopment Act of 1945..., 1978, p. 46. In part, the plan cleared the way for GSA to build new large federal office buildings between Independence Avenue SW and Southeast Freeway to its south.Gutheim and Lee, Worthy of the Nation, 2006, p. 274. The HUD building, the only office building south of the railroad tracks (which bifurcated the area on an east-west axis), was designed to be a showcase for the Ad Hoc Committee's design guidelines.Wasserman and Hausrath, Washington, D.C. from A to Z, 2003, p. 92-93.Grooms, \\"The Charrette Process: A Tool for Achieving Design Excellence,\\" in Federal Facilities Beyond the 1990s: Ensuring Quality in an Era of Limited Resources, 1997, p. 108. Internationally known architect Marcel Breuer submitted the building's winning design. Breuer became the building's lead architect, assisted by his associate Herbert Beckhard and the firm of Nolen-Swinburne. Breuer drew on many of his previous buildings for inspiration for HUD Headquarters. He had built curvilinear precast concrete buildings before for UNESCO's world headquarters in Paris and the IBM Research Center in La Gaude (both in France).Hodges and Hodges, Washington on Foot, 1980, p. 41. The curvilinear shape allowed the maximum amount of natural light to reach the maximum number of offices. This design also reflected much of the architectural style adopted during the early 1960s in Washington, D.C., (notably at the Watergate complex).Kennon and Striner, Washington Past and Present: A Guide to the Nation's Capital, 1987, p. 71. The final design resembles that of a giant capital letter \\"X\\" with an elongated spine and four bilateral, symmetrical, curving arms. The four arms created four spaces. The northern space was given over to gigantic HVAC vents. The western space was planted with grass and with low concrete benches lining the semicircular space. GSA's design specifications required that extensive underground parking be incorporated into the building. Breuer designed a lightweight, plaza to fit as a sort of roof over the underground parking garage.Schwartz, et al., Martha Schwartz: Transfiguration of the Commonplace, 1997, p. 162.Porter, \\"Disillusioned in D.C.: I Was Dazzled By The Virtual HUD Plaza‚ÄîThen I Saw the Real Thing,\\" Landscape Architecture, July 2001, p. 32. The plaza surface would be covered in masonry \\"stones\\", with a curving driveway (mimicking the building facade) to lead vehicular traffic into the garage entrance and exit (which were situated in the center of the plaza). An offshoot of the driveway (set off by bollards) came up to the front doors to allow the limousines of high-ranking visitors to pull up directly to the building's front doors. Because the weight of the plaza/roof had to be kept light, no plantings (lawns, trees, shrubs, etc.) were envisioned for the plaza. Although the plaza was devoid of plants, its shape and vast expanse were designed to relate aesthetically to the nearby National Mall. Deep-set windows in rectilinear shapes, a Breuer trademark, were planned for the facade.Williams, Southwest Washington, 2006, p. 67. The window frames were made of precast concrete. The building was the first Breuer-designed structure in the United States to use a precast concrete facade,Beckhard, \\"The Breuer- Beckhard Precast Facades,\\" in Exterior Wall Systems: Glass and Concrete Technology, Design, and Construction, 1991, p. 158. and this was the first federal building to be built of precast concrete.Nelson, Guide to the Presidency: The White House and the Executive Branch, 2002, p. 972.Scott and Lee, Buildings of the District of Columbia, 1993, p. 239. The facade was designed to be load-bearing, with the panels on the second, third, and fourth floors designed to carry the weight of the building. The window frames on the eighth, ninth, and tenth floors were slightly thinner, because although they were not load-bearing they had to contain HVAC piping. The panels on the middle floors required the least amount of fabrication, according to architect Herbert Beckhard (an associate in Breuer's firm who helped design the building), as they did not need to bear as much load nor contain much piping. The windows do not meet at the corner of the concrete frame. Pipes from the I-395 tunnel (which runs below the building) run up through the building's walls and vent at the corners of the window frames, dispersing automobile exhaust fumes high in the air. Each concrete unit is thick and weighs almost 13 tons (11.8 metric tonnes).\\"Robert C. Weaver Federal Building, Washington, DC: Building Overview,\\" August 4, 2009. The firm which supplied the window frames had no previous experience producing architectural concrete, but instead had supplied precast forms for bridges and parking garages. The structure's interior floors were also made precast concrete. However, the floors were almost made of more than-traditional materials. Late in the design process, GSA accountants estimated that the cost of precast concrete for the flooring would be exceptionally high, and GSA threatened to change the architectural plans. But after extensive discussions between GSA and Breuer, GSA relented. The plans were let to bid as designed, and the floors were fabricated for significantly less than estimated. The base of the building was designed to look much different from the upper nine floors. The building's first floor is recessed, with load-bearing concrete pilotis (piers) supporting the upper floors at intervals around the building. The V-shaped columns taper to a narrow base that creates a more open, \\"lighter\\" appearance at ground level and whose angularity contrasts with the building's curving facade.Goldberger, \\"Marcel Breuer, 79, Dies,\\" New York Times, July 2, 1981. The walls of the recessed first floor are not bare concrete but rather sheathed in granite. No abrasive blasting or acid etching of the visible exterior concrete was used to smooth the appearance of the structure, as Breuer and Beckhard believed concrete casting techniques had advanced sufficiently to no longer require it. An Oscar Stonorov bust of Catherine Bauer Wurster, an influential public housing advocate in the 1930s, adorns the building's Main (South) lobby.\\"Bust of Late Catherine Bauer Wurster Placed in HUD Building,\\" Journal of Housing, 1968. The project was expected to cost $32 million, although only $29 million was appropriated by Congress for construction. Construction and naming Title to the land under the future HUD building was held by the D.C. Redevelopment Land Agency, and site preparation began in November 1965.L'Enfant Plaza Properties, Inc. v. United States, 645 F.2d 886. Groundbreaking and construction had already begun by the spring of 1966.Corrigan, \\"Carpenters' Talks Break Off,\\" Washington Post, May 3, 1966. John McShain, Inc., one of the largest federal building contractors in the Washington metro area, was named the lead construction contractor. A strike by the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America temporarily delayed construction in May 1966. The building's cornerstone was laid by Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey in November of that year.\\"Today in Washington,\\" Washington Post, November 10, 1966. Unfortunately, during the HUD building's construction, the footings for the western portion of the building were accidentally built over the property line.L'Enfant Plaza East, Inc. v. John McShain, Inc. 359 A.2d 5. The -thick footings were underground. When L'Enfant Properties, leaseholder of the property abutting the HUD site, began construction of L'Enfant Plaza Hotel in 1971, the company was forced to sue John McShain, Inc. and the Redevelopment Land Agency for removal of the footings, stabilization of the HUD structure, and associated costs. The action spawned several lengthy court battles which lasted through the 1970s. The HUD headquarters building was formally dedicated on September 21, 1968. President Johnson and HUD Secretary Robert C. Weaver attended the ceremony. The final structure contained of office space.\\"HUD Building Seen As Turning Point for Department and Public Architecture,\\" Journal of Housing, 1968. There were 10 stories of offices above ground, and another two floors below ground. The final cost was just $26 million (about $162 million in 2010 dollars). In 2000, the HUD building was officially renamed the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building in honor of Dr. Robert C. Weaver, the first HUD Secretary and the first African American Cabinet member.Barron, \\"Robert C. Weaver, 89, First Black Cabinet Member, Dies,\\" New York Times, July 19, 1997; Muhammad, \\"HUD Building Renamed In Honor of Robert C. Weaver,\\" Washington Informer, July 19, 2000; \\"Black History Month Salutes Black Leaders, Astronauts, Billionaires,\\" Wilkes County News-Reporter, February 1, 2007. Main plaza reconstruction The plaza was roundly criticized by HUD employees. Not a single positive comment about the plaza was given by HUD workers in a 1979 survey, and employees strongly criticized the lack of seating in the space.See, generally, Project for Public Spaces, The HUD Building, Washington, D.C.: A Public Space Improvement Plan, 1979. The plaza as a whole, one urban planning group concluded, was bleak and unwelcoming. Signage, lighting, identification of entrances, and the regulation of pedestrian traffic in the plaza, the Project for Public Spaces told HUD (which had commissioned a study of the building), were so poor that they were characterized as a \\"disaster\\".Project for Public Spaces, The HUD Building, Washington, D.C.: A Public Space Improvement Plan, 1979, p. 13. The donut-shaped, white canopies on the Weaver Building's main plaza at night. The exit from the parking garage can be seen under the canopies, and the lighted entrance to the Main (South) Lobby in the middle- left distance. In the late 1980s, the plaza began leaking water into the building's underground parking garage.Grooms, \\"The Charrette Process: A Tool for Achieving Design Excellence,\\" in Federal Facilities Beyond the 1990s: Ensuring Quality in an Era of Limited Resources, 1997, p. 108-110. Rather than merely fix the leak, HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros encouraged GSA to renovate or reconstruct the plaza to make it more worker- and pedestrian-friendly. In 1990, Martha Schwartz, a nationally recognized Massachusetts-based landscape architect known for her unconventional and colorful designs, was commissioned to redesign the plaza. Schwartz initially envisioned low, round, concrete planters containing grass that would double as seating, and donut-shaped canopies of brightly colored plastic (lit from within at night) set upon 18-foot steel poles to provide shelter from the sun and rain.McKee, \\"The Battle for Pep-O-Mint Plaza,\\" Washington City Paper, May 22‚Äì28, 1998.Forgey, \\"Flying Saucers At HUD,\\" Washington Post, June 6, 1998. Schwartz developed her design in 1994 after receiving public feedback during a workshop sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts. Although the design had passed through the GSA's rigorous planning and design process and had the support of J. Carter Brown (then-chairman of the United States Commission of Fine Arts, which had co-approval over the design) and HUD Secretary Cisneros (a trained urban planner), GSA Commissioner Robert A. Peck strongly disliked it. By the time Schwartz's design was ready for installation, Cisneros had left HUD and Andrew M. Cuomo was the new Secretary. Cuomo is alleged to have disliked the canopies and feared that the brightly colored plastic would draw public ridicule, and so pressed for alterations. In a compromise, the canopies were retained but colored a neutral white. Schwartz also designed a back-lit mural composed of images of HUD-financed building projects to be installed on the granite wall under the loggia, but this was canceled due to cost concerns. Critical assessment The Robert C. Weaver Federal Building is one of two buildings in Washington, D.C., designed by Marcel Breuer (the other is the Hubert H. Humphrey Building).Conroy, \\"Marcel Breuer, Architect, Pioneer of Modern Furniture Design, Dies,\\" Washington Post, July 3, 1981. The Weaver Building is considered a prime example of Breuer's \\"soft\\" Brutalist aesthetic. Critics say it \\"set new civic standards for architectural design\\", and have called it a masterpiece of Modern architecture. At the structure's dedication, President Lyndon B. Johnson declared it \\"bold and beautiful,\\" HUD Secretary Robert C. Weaver said it was \\"urban and urbane,\\" and GSA Administrator Lawson B. Knott, Jr., praised it as \\"a lasting architectural asset to our capital city and our country\\". The New York Times said the building \\"is a handsome, functional structure that adds quality design and genuine 20th century style to a city badly in need of both.\\" In 1998, The Washington Post architectural critic called the building \\"impressive...a brooding, strangely graceful concrete honeycomb.\\" Architecture critic Carole Rifkind called it \\"compelling by virtue of the swaggering efficiency of the construction system.\\"Rifkind, A Field Guide to Contemporary American Architecture, 1998, p. 124. Yet, the building is not admired by many. The building had very little grass or garden space where employees could eat or relax during lunch, and very little of that planted space contained seating‚Äîwhich caused extensive employee resentment. The garden areas had such small trash containers that they overflowed every workday afternoon. The building's interior spaces were also strongly critiqued by the late 1970s. According to the Project for Public Spaces, which studied the building on HUD's behalf: :The lack of welcome extends into the building lobbies, where there is a need for information of nearly every kind. ...there are no public maps; outdoor directional signs are too few and too small; the Metro signposts are so discreet they are hard to find;...there is no indication of where visitors should enter; the entrances are hard to find;...the main reception desk is in the south lobby, though more people enter through the north; information boards are not where people look for them; house phones are not clearly labeled; cafeteria entrances and the HUD information center are hidden. Finally, the lobbies themselves are so dimly lit‚Äîespecially in contrast to the glaring front plaza‚Äîthat this, too, adds to the confusion. In 2009, then Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan noted that \\"the building itself is among the most reviled in all of Washington‚Äîand with good reason.\\" Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp once described the building as \\"10 floors of basement.\\" One historian of urban planning called the building an \\"out-of-towner's 'ego trip'\\".Gournay, \\"Washington: The DC's History of Unresolved Planning Conflicts,\\" in Planning Twentieth Century Capital Cities, 2006, p. 122. An architectural critic for The Washington Times wrote in 2007, \\"They are two of the ugliest buildings in town: the austere, concrete hulk of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on 7th Street Southwest and its counterpart, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Independence Avenue Southwest. ... Mr. Breuer's sculptural style, named 'brutalism' for 'b√©ton brut' (French for 'raw concrete'), has come to represent the worst aspects of modern architecture: stark, unfriendly buildings fronted by empty plazas.\\"Dietsch, \\"Benign Breuer: Exhibit Ignores Bauhaus Architect's Mistakes,\\" Washington Times, November 3, 2007. The Washington City Paper said the building \\"sits up on stilts that look like rhinoceros feet, aloof from everything around it.\\" Many critics have argued that Breuer's design is unoriginal, and essentially mimics the UNESCO Headquarters and IBM Research Center which he designed several years earlier.Davis, Remaking Cities: Proceedings of the 1988 International Conference in Pittsburgh, 1989, p. 12. The Schwartz-designed plaza, too, has been criticized. \\"It looks as though a battalion of seven flying saucers has floated down to Earth in front of the Department of Housing and Urban Development,\\" wrote the Washington City Paper. \\"[W]hat stands on HUD's plaza today is not so much the homage to shelter Schwartz originally intended as a token of capitulation.\\" The canopies have been criticized for being too far from the round seating area/planters and not close enough to the street, thus rendering them useless as the shelter they were designed to be. The Project for Public Spaces rated the plaza the eighth- worst public plaza in the world in 2004.\\"The World's Best and Worst Parks,\\" Making Places, September 2004. Others have praised the plaza's new design. The Washington Post said the canopies provide \\"a pleasant shock... Seven ghostly spaceships appear to be hovering comfortably above its front yard, keeping watch over an orderly gathering of white-rimmed, ground-hugging disks shouldering healthy mounds of grass.\\" Footnotes Bibliography *\\"An Eyeful of Washington Eyesores.\\" Washington Post.

It causes irregular white patches or blotches on the coral that result from the loss of coral tissue. These patches distinguish white pox disease from white band disease which produces a distinctive white band where the coral skeleton has been denuded. The blotches caused by this disease are also clearly differentiated from coral bleaching and scars caused by coral-eating snails. It is very contagious, spreading to nearby coral. At the locations where white pox disease has been observed, it is estimated to have reduced the living tissue in elkhorn corals by 50‚Äì80%. In the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS), the losses of living coral are estimated to average around 88%.

Completed in 1938, the building was designated by Congress as a contributing structure to the Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site in 1966, and it was subsequently listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Building history Apex Building under construction in 1937. Issues of antitrust legislation, tariff reduction, and tax reform dominated the 1912 presidential race, which culminated in the election of Woodrow Wilson as the twenty-eighth president of the United States. Honoring his campaign promises, Wilson signed the Federal Trade Commission Act in 1914. The following year, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) absorbed the duties of the Bureau of Corporations in the United States Department of Commerce. The FTC conducted investigations, published reports, and scrutinized industries such as meatpacking. It could challenge unfair competition and practices in trade and commerce.General Services Administration page on the Federal Trade Commission Building. The FTC occupied various sites in the District of Columbia during its early years. The Public Buildings Act of 1926 authorized Congress to fund the Federal Triangle project, a large-scale initiative to develop a 70-acre site between the White House and the U.S. Capitol with federal buildings executed in classical styles of architecture. At the urging of the American Institute of Architects, the U.S. Treasury Department turned over principal design responsibilities to private architects. Edward H. Bennett of the Chicago firm Bennett, Parsons and Frost oversaw the project and designed the final building, which would become the headquarters for the FTC. In 1937, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt laid the building cornerstone with the silver trowel that George Washington used to lay the cornerstone of the U.S. Capitol in 1793. In his speech, Roosevelt expressed hope that the \\"permanent home of the Federal Trade Commission stand for all time as a symbol of the purpose of the government to insist on a greater application of the golden rule to the conduct of corporation and business and enterprises in their relationship to the body politic.\\" Located at the eastern point of the Federal Triangle, it was originally called the Apex Building. Staff moved into the building on April 21, 1938. Over the years, the FTC's responsibilities expanded to include the enforcement of credit laws, oversight of the National Do Not Call Registry, and the development of policies concerning Internet fraud and privacy. Loyalty Board reviews occurred in the Apex Building in 1948 concurrently with the first month of the Hiss-Chambers Case, as reported by the New York Times. Architecture right The Federal Trade Commission Building is designed in the Classical Revival style of architecture. It is a refined style that conveys the dignity and stability of the federal government, which was particularly important during the Great Depression. The buildings within the Federal Triangle were designed according to principles of the City Beautiful movement, which espoused the use of formal arrangements, axial streets, and monumental, classical public buildings in city planning. Earlier in his career, the FTC Building's architect, Edward H. Bennett, was an assistant to prominent architect and planner Daniel H. Burnham, a pioneer in city planning responsible for the layout of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, as well as designs for Chicago and San Francisco. Burnham's influence is evident in Bennett's work on the FTC Building. Bennett's design emphasizes the relationship between the building and its site. It is located on a triangular parcel of land bounded by Pennsylvania and Constitution avenues and Seventh Street, NW; the building has an essentially triangular footprint with a semicircular portico at one end. An interior courtyard provides natural light to interior offices. The building has undergone few changes since its construction. The seven-story building sits on a simple base of Mount Airy granite. The walls above are clad in large, smooth blocks of Indiana limestone laid in a regular pattern. Bays on the midsection of each elevation are divided by pilasters (attached columns) or colonnades that form a loggia (open-air, arcaded space). The seventh story is slightly recessed. The portico is supported by Ionic columns. Aluminum window and door grilles accent the exterior. The low hipped roof is covered with red terra-cotta tiles. The interior spaces are relatively restrained; only public spaces and hearing rooms are afforded a measure of distinction. Three lobbies on the first floor share similar features. Floors are covered with large, dark green terrazzo panels with black borders. Walls are clad in Neshobe gray marble with black marble on fluted pilasters, and plaster covers the ceiling and cornice. The FTC Building was one of the first federal buildings in Washington to have an integral air-conditioning system and a basement parking garage. Man Controlling Trade by Michael Lantz As part of the building plan, the Section of Painting and Sculpture oversaw the design and installation of several significant works of art. Two bas-relief medallions with eagles are located on the northwest corner elevation. Officials requested that the artist, Sidney Waugh, develop a fresh interpretation on the symbol, and the resulting design is highly stylized, relating well to the building's other modern works. Large aluminum entrance grilles function as doors on the Constitution Avenue elevation. Images on the grilles, which were designed by William McVey, portray a continuum of commerce-related transportation methods. Depictions include Christopher Columbus's 14th-century ships, an 18th-century merchant ship, 19th-century clipper ship, paddlewheel steamship, early 20th-century ocean liner, and seaplane. Above the grilles are rectangular panels, each executed by a different artist, that represent foreign trade, agriculture, shipping, and industry. Two nearly identical allegorical sculptural groups called Man Controlling Trade are located at the east ends of the two avenue elevations. Michael Lantz designed the sculptures in the Art Deco style. In each, a muscular man holds a straining stallion, symbolizing the enormity of trade and the government in its role as enforcer. The sculptures have become the agency's informal logo.

It serves as the headquarters of the United States Tax Court. Built in 1972, the building and its landscaped plaza occupy the entire block bound by D Street, E Street, Second Street, and Third street.Introduction to the U.S. Tax Court. Building history Government officials selected master architect Victor A. Lundy, renowned for his sculptural architectural designs and innovative uses of engineering technology, to design the building in 1965. They awarded Lundy the contract without competition, expressing their confidence in his abilities to design a Modern landmark. The design follows the \\"Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture\\" issued by the Ad Hoc Committee on Federal Office Space at the request of President John F. Kennedy in 1962. In an attempt to improve federal buildings, the committee recommended architecture that would convey the \\"dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the American Government\\". Designers and officials were encouraged to pay special attention to site selection and layout, including landscape development. In the 1930s, the U.S. Board of Tax Appeals, later renamed the Tax Court of the United States, was housed in the Internal Revenue Service Building in the Federal Triangle. By 1956, overcrowding and the desire to separate judicial and executive powers led to initial attempts to relocate the court. In 1962, Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon appealed to the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) to incorporate funds for the design of a new building in its upcoming budget. GSA subsequently allocated $450,000. In 1966, GSA approved Lundy's concept for a building with strong end masses, a central cantilevered courtroom block, and a landscaped plaza. Despite enthusiastic support for the project, the Vietnam War triggered funding cuts that delayed construction until 1972, when GSA secured a site and held a groundbreaking ceremony. The completed building was dedicated on November 22, 1974, the fiftieth anniversary of the Revenue Act that created the court. Employees occupied the building on January 20, 1975. Due to escalating construction costs, the plaza was not completed until 1981. Lundy's design won a GSA Honor Award in the first Design Awards Program held in 1972. Architecture Frontal view of the United States Tax Court Building Describing his landmark building, Lundy stated, \\"What I've done is taken a monolithic block and broken it apart\\". Striking and bold, the building exemplifies the culmination of Modern design principles coupled with technological advances that allowed for a new type of building. The building is not only one of the most sophisticated and successful examples of Modernism in the District of Columbia, but also in the government's inventory. Hailing the design in 1967, distinguished New York Times architectural critic Ada Louise Huxtable described the plans for the U.S. Tax Court Building as \\"a progressive, sensitive, contemporary solution fully responsive to Washington's classical tradition and yet fully part of the mid-20th century - a period of exceptional vigor and beauty in the history of structure and design\\". The building presents itself as a cube that has been deconstructed into four units: a dramatic cantilevered courtroom block on the front with office blocks on each side and to the rear. These four components surmount a single-story base called the podium. The building is clad in flame- treated Royal Pearl granite from Georgia and bronze-tinted, heat-absorbing, glare-reducing glass with slim bronze-anodized aluminum mullions. Lundy's skillful use of materials and voids between blocks articulate the units. Lundy employed state-of-the-art engineering technology to achieve his design. The building's structure not only allowed Lundy's design to be securely executed, but also is a significant engineering accomplishment. Compression and post- tensioned bridges, steel cables hidden within the building's walls, and six slender columns together support the imposing 4,000-ton cantilevered courtroom block, which projects over the entrance. The compression and tension bridges also function as interior circulation bridges. In uniting the interior and exterior of the building, Lundy stated, \\"Inside this building, you will always have a sense of where you are and of the sky outside\\". The building's exterior forms indicate the interior spatial arrangements. The interior is defined by a soaring four-story central public hall, also called the Hall of Justice, crowned by a clerestory roof that admits light into the space. Lundy created a hierarchy of interior spaces through his use of materials, which were restrained yet wholly appropriate for the Modern era. The walls of the public hall consist of exposed, board-formed concrete and the exterior bronze-tinted glass curtain wall. The floor is covered with Royal Pearl granite pavers. The same granite also surfaces the original security desk in the center of the hall. The upper three stories of the hall consist of projecting cantilevered galleries that provide circulation for the upper stories. A screen of louvered teak strips extends from the second to fourth floors and allows natural light to filter into the spaces. The hall ceiling is covered in tongue-in-groove hemlock planks. The courtroom block projects from the east wall of the public hall. On the third floor, a large ceremonial courtroom is flanked by two smaller courtrooms. A curved wall encloses the central courtroom, which contains a semi-circular judges' bench. Courtrooms are finished in full-height teak veneer panels and strips. Hemlock grilles cover the ceilings. Lundy designed the plaza, located on the Second Street side of the building, with a central reflecting pool flanked by landscaped areas. Interstate 395 runs directly beneath the plaza. Its formal design provides an appropriate approach to the colossal flight of stairs leading into the monumental building.

It is a large stone building constructed at the beginning of the 20th century. State architect George Heins designed it for what was at the time the 29th Separate Company of the New York Army National Guard. It was his first armory for the state. The 29th was later absorbed into other New York-based Guard and Reserve units. After closing in 1977, it is now the local YMCA. In 1995 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places along with other New York armories. Building The armory is located on a lot that takes up the eastern half of the block formed by Lee Place, Pearl Street and Prospect Avenue (NY 63) a few blocks northeast of downtown Medina. The surrounding properties are all residential, with the exception of a large former school building to the west on Catherine Street. The terrain is level. The building itself is a two-story structure of Medina sandstone laid in a random ashlar pattern with a raised foundation. It consists of two sections: the main administration building, facing south to Prospect Street, and an attached drill shed on the north. A modern flat-roofed garage is attached to the northeast of the drill shed, projecting eastward. The southeast portion of the lot is given over to a large lawn with some planted shrubs surrounding the flagpole. In the center of the south (front) facade of the administration building is the projecting entrance pavilion. On either side two engaged octagonal towers rise to crenelated parapets. The entrance itself is a recessed segmental arched sally port with a pair of paneled oak doors below a tripartite transom. Stepped gabled ends project from the hipped roof shingled in asphalt with standing seam metal. The tall, narrow windows have iron grilles on the first story, matched in the rectangular basement windows. On the side elevations of the nine-bay drill shed are paired narrow flat-arched windows set off by buttresses. Secondary entrances on both sides have four- paneled doors with similar transoms to the front entrance. The north (rear) has three groups of tall, narrow windows with buttresses. Inside, most of the original finishings remains. The entrance hall has a large oak staircase, the company meeting room a tin ceiling. The walls have their original oak baseboard and plaster; many of the oak doors are original. At the time of the armory's listing on the Register, many rooms had been partitioned. The drill shed has exposed steel trusses, wainscoted ceilings, a balcony and wooden floors. History Col. Hesikiah Bowen raised Bowen's Rifles, the precursor unit to the 29th, in 1838 in response to the escalating tensions of the Aroostook War in Maine, which threatened to start a third war between the United States and Britain. Hostilities were avoided and the unit was never deployed, but it survived for several years afterwards. Later another unit, Linus Beecher's Light Guards, replaced them although it was primarily a social organization. That unit eventually became the Pitts Light Guards. In late 1891, the 29th was formally mustered under the command of Capt. A.S. Ross. Two other officers commanded 55 enlisted men. At first they used the floors of a Main Street building, but soon the community began to agitate for the construction of an armory. Assemblyman Fred Downs lobbied the state government, and later in the decade the project was approved. The 29th soon saw its first action during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The present lot was acquired in 1899, and by September of that year the foundations were being dug. The state approved the completed building late in 1901, two years later. The land and construction together had cost $57,160 ($ in contemporary dollars). It was the first of seven extant armories designed by George Heins, who had replaced Isaac Perry as New York's state architect. Like his predecessor, Heins used many features of medieval military architecture such as towers, crenelation, parapets and sally ports, for an overall Gothic effect. His interpretations of those forms and details differ by being more modern and stylized than Perry's. A distinctive touch in Medina was the use of locally quarried Medina sandstone, at the time a highly popular material that was the county's major non-agricultural product. Originally the armory had a flat roof. Renovations in 1912 gave it the current hip-gable combination. The following year the unit was called up to help suppress the streetcar strike in Buffalo. By then it would be known as Company F of the New York National Guard's Third Regiment. In April 1917, the unit was deployed into World War I as part of the 27th Division, drawn entirely from the New York National Guard. A Buffalo unit was stationed in the armory in their absence as a home guard. In 1919, after the war, the unit became Company F of the 108th Infantry. During World War II, it was Company L of the 65th Regiment. For the last three years of the Guard's use of the armory, the unit was Company C of the 174th Infantry. In 1977, the state announced it would be closed and its units moved to other locations. The Medina community, not wanting to see the building become neglected, formed the Armory Action Committee. It worked to adapt the armory for local recreational use, partitioning the office space in the process. After 20 years the Lake Plains YMCA, which bought the building from the state. was fully established in the building. It continues to operate, with over a thousand members and a wide range of programs.

L√°szl√≥ S√≥lyom is seen at right during a 2006 joint press conference with Russian Federation president Vladimir Putin. The only official reason given for the denial was that the Hungarian president's visit might have constituted a security risk. Slovak prime minister Robert Fico had claimed that police would be unable to prevent Slovak extremist groups from disturbing the ceremony. In the two days preceding the visit, Slovakia had raised four other objections to the planned trip: * The ceremony might suggest a claim of Hungarian sovereignty over Slovak soil. * Slovakia was informed late about the visit. * The date of the visit fell one day after the Hungarian national holiday commemorating St. Stephen and coincided with the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. * Slovak leaders were not invited, nor did the president have plans to meet with them. The square in Kom√°rno where the life- size bronze statue of St. Stephen on horseback has since been erected, photographed in 2007. Declaring the Hungarian head of state an unwelcome person (essentially persona non grata, although this term was not used) created additional diplomatic conflict in already tense Hungary‚ÄìSlovakia relations.

Both the Catholic and the Orthodox churches regard King Stephen as a saint for his role in converting the peoples of his kingdom to Christianity. Pope Gregory VII canonized him, his son and a bishop; August 20, 1083, the day of the canonization, is a public holiday in Hungary, regarded as the foundation of Hungarian statehood. In his Admonitions to his son, he declared, as cited in the planned speech of S√≥lyom for the unveiling: The Kom√°rno statue was due to be unveiled on the day after this anniversary, that is, on August 21, 2009. The erection of the statue itself was criticized in February 2009 by the extremist and nationalist Slovak National Party (SNS), one of the parties in Slovakia's governing coalition, because the town had not erected statues of Saints Cyril and Methodius, two Byzantine Greek missionaries among the Slavic peoples of Great Moravia and Pannonia. The statue was consequently placed only on the balcony of the Matica Slovensk√°, a cultural and scientific institution focusing on Slovakia-related topics. Objections of Slovakia against the visit Security risk Robert Fico, Prime Minister of Slovakia. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said on August 19 that he could not prevent S√≥lyom from entering the country and sent a letter to the Hungarian embassy warning of potential security risks, saying that his Direction ‚Äì Social Democracy party government would not prevent extremists of the nationalist Slovensk√° pospolitos≈• (Slovak Brotherhood) from going there to demonstrate.\\"Fico: S√≥lyom lesz a felel≈ës az√©rt, ha R√©vkom√°romban valami t√∂rt√©nik\\" (\\"Fico: S√≥lyom will be responsible if something happens in Kom√°rno\\"), MTI, 19 August 2009.

According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Hungary, there were no real security risks involved around the ceremony:\\"A k√ºl√ºgyminiszter tiltakozott a szlov√°k nagyk√∂vetn√©l a k√∂zt√°rsas√°gi eln√∂k l√°togat√°s√°nak meghi√∫sul√°sa miatt\\" , 24 August 2009. Retrieved 2010-03-15. Date Hungarian Prime Minister Gordon Bajnai stated that the planned visit had nothing to do with the 1968 events. Two days before the planned visit, the Slovak parliamentary foreign affairs committee called the trip \\"a diplomatic provocation\\" because of the August 21 date, although the date was chosen by the mayor of Kom√°rno, not by S√≥lyom. August 21 is the anniversary of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia led by the Soviet Union after the 1968 Prague Spring. Being a Warsaw Pact state, the People's Republic of Hungary also sent troops into Slovakia; Poland and Bulgaria also took part in the Soviet putsch. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico compared L√°szl√≥ S√≥lyom to the soldiers invading Czechoslovakia: \\"In 1968 Hungarian tanks were coming to Slovakia.

However some in the Slovak press questioned if Fico were truly troubled by the date; the Slovak paper SME wrote: : Late notification On June 19, 2009, S√≥lyom had notified Peter Weiss, Slovakia's ambassador to Hungary, of the planned visit, regarded as the \\"highest level of official notification\\" in diplomacy. S√≥lyom's office stated that Slovakia had mentioned no objections to the trip until the week of the planned visit.: Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico called this statement a lie, claiming that Hungary only informed Slovakia on August 13.http://mti.hu/cikk/413770/ Foreign Minister of Hungary, P√©ter Bal√°zs retorted that the named date, August 13, was the start of the technical preparations and not the notification, which had happened on June 19. Stressing Hungarian statehood in inappropriate circumstances Ivan Ga≈°paroviƒç, President of the Slovak Republic, said S√≥lyom \\"likes to prowl around\\" in areas of the Hungarian Kingdom that do not belong to present-day Hungary. The three main leaders of Slovakia Ivan Ga≈°paroviƒç (President of the Republic), Robert Fico (Prime Minister) and Pavol Paska (Chairman of the Parliament) stated in a common declaration that the visit is a \\"deliberate provocation against Slovakia\\". The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Hungary noted: No plans of meeting Slovak leaders Slovaks have criticised S√≥lyom for not inviting Slovak leaders to the ceremony or meeting them somewhere else, even though S√≥lyom was not the organizer of the ceremony, as it was organized by the town of Kom√°rno. Previously, the Slovak diplomacy informed the Hungarian diplomacy that Ivan Ga≈°paroviƒç Slovak Head of State will be on vacation on the day of the visit. Ga≈°paroviƒç declared earlier that he would only accept any invitations if the town also erects statues about Saints Cyril and Methodius. Neither Ga≈°paroviƒç nor Fico distanced themselves from government party leader J√°n Slota for his earlier comments disparaging Saint Stephen, the king portrayed by the Kom√°rno staue, as a \\"clown on a horse\\". Fico made further attacks on Saint Stephen and also said Slovaks should not consider him as their king. Timeline of events June 19 On June 19, L√°szl√≥ S√≥lyom met the new ambassador of Slovakia to Hungary, Peter Weiss. On this meeting S√≥lyom informed Weiss about the planned ceremony he was invited to, and that he intends to go there. August 13 On August 13, the bilateral technical preparations to the ceremony began. August 19 Two days before the planned visit, on August 19, the committee of foreign affairs of the Slovak Parliament called the trip a diplomatic provocation because of the date August 21, anniversary of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Ivan Ga≈°paroviƒç, President of the Slovak Republic called the visit an \\"inconsiderate decision\\", stating to the press that he is not surprised because he knows S√≥lyom \\"likes to prowl around\\" in the countries that are in the area of the pre-1920 Kingdom of Hungary. Back then, Fico said they can not and will not prevent S√≥lyom from entering the country. August 20 Miroslav Lajƒç√°k, Slovak Minister of Foreign Affairs said Slovak-Hungarian relations have already been harmed by the issue. On August 20, Miroslav Lajƒç√°k, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Slovakia officially informed Antal Heizer, ambassador of Hungary in Bratislava that L√°szl√≥ S√≥lyom is not recommended to cross the border on the next day.

L√°szl√≥ S√≥lyom sent a message to Ga≈°paroviƒç in which he indicated that he maintains his intentions about unveiling the statue. He wrote in the message that he informed Slovakia in time and no objections have been raised earlier about the date. He also made clear that he already expressed his regret about the aggression against Czechoslovakia in a public speech on the 40th anniversary in 2008. Denial of entry Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico announced in the afternoon, hours before the unveiling that S√≥lyom will be not allowed to enter the territory of Slovakia. The document stating this was sent to the Hungarian embassy in Bratislava. Fico also told the press that Slovak authorities would not prevent the president from crossing the border by physical force, but they will consider it as a serious provocation if he still enters Slovakia. Miroslav Lajƒç√°k, Slovak Minister of Foreign Affairs said the relations of Hungary and Slovakia have already been harmed by this issue. On the border J√°n Packa, executive of the police of Slovakia and a great number of policemen were waiting.http://index.hu/belfold/2009/08/21/nem_ajanljak_a_szlovakok_solyomnak_hogy_revkomaromba_utazzon/ President S√≥lyom did not enter Slovakia, after the embassy received a document stating that S√≥lyom is refused entry into Slovakia: He walked to the middle of the bridge over the Danube leading from Hungarian Kom√°rom to Slovak Kom√°rno and held a press conference about the events on the Hungarian side of the border. He stated:Press release on the website of the Office of the Republic of Hungary Ceremony in absence of S√≥lyom The news stating that S√≥lyom is not allowed to enter Slovakia, was received with loud whistling among the gathered 2000-3000 people on the square where the statue was about to be unveiled. The speeches before the unveiling were about the needed cooperation, and encouraged peace between the two countries, which was received with applause by the mainly Hungarian celebrators.

Reactions of the Hungarian diplomacy The government of Hungary called the ban \\"unexpected\\", \\"unfounded\\" and its justification \\"deplorable\\" and \\"unacceptable\\".http://www.mti.hu/cikk/413770/ P√©ter Bal√°zs Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs - cutting his vacation short - called in the Slovak ambassador Peter Weiss and protested the unprecedented act coming from an EU and NATO member state.D√ºb√∂r√∂g a szl√≥v√°k-magyar diplom√°ciai h√°bor√∫ P√©ter Bal√°zs asked for explanation. The chairman of the Committee of Foreign Affairs of the Parliament of Hungary, Zsolt N√©meth declared: He also claimed that it is the duty of the international community to find a way of driving Slovakia back to the road of respecting human rights and minority rights. The political parties of Hungary have also protested against the Slovak decision. The governing Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) said, it is definitely Slovakia who is responsible for the worsened relations, who as a young nation state seek their identity, which sometimes turns into fierce nationalism. Legal disputes According to P√©ter Bal√°zs, the ban was not lawful, because the already given international permissions haven't been withdrawn and so the embassy just got an \\"unfriendly\\" document, which would in theory have allowed S√≥lyom to enter Slovakia. He also said the Slovak diplomacy has turned international law \\"upside down\\" by leaving the international permissions while banning S√≥lyom personally, as a civilian. He stated that Hungary plans to inform the EU and a broader international public about this \\"rude\\" political action. Legality confirmed On 6 March 2012 Advocate General at the European Court of Justice Yves Bot gave an opinion on the legality of the ban. He concluded that the visit was not a private but an official one and as such was not covered by the free movement provisions of the EU law. Diplomatic relations are governed exclusively by the member states and follow the international law under which visits by the heads of states depend on the consent of the host state. The court, dismissing the action brought by Hungary, followed the general line of reasoning of the Advocate General.European Court of Justice: judgment in Case C‚Äë364/10 Hungary v Slovakia Media coverage Slovakia In the Slovak press, the opinions were divided about the move of the Slovak government.

It is located in the capital city Washington, D.C., and houses the office of the United States Secretary of State. The Truman Building is located in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood at 2201 C Street, NW, bounded by C Street to the south, E Street, D Street, and Virginia Avenue to the north, 21st Street to the east, and 23rd Street to the west. It is located to the west of Edward J. Kelly Park and north of the National Academy of Sciences building and the National Mall. The Truman Building is named after Harry Truman, the 33rd President of the United States, who was influential in the advancement of the State Department. History 20th century During the early 1930s, the National Capital Park and Planning Commission sought to develop the section of the District of Columbia known as Foggy Bottom, located between C, E, Eighteenth, and Twenty-third streets. Leading up to World War II, the expanding Department of War occupied several different buildings on the mall, making the need for a new building to consolidate operations a high priority. It was always intended to construct the building in two phases, and the Foggy Bottom site was chosen because it was large enough to accommodate both. Gilbert Stanley Underwood and William Dewey Foster won the contract for the War Department building. They designed the building during 1938‚Äì1939 and construction began in 1940. The Public Buildings Administration of the Federal Works Agency, which inherited oversight responsibility for the federal buildings program from the U.S. Treasury Department in 1939, completed the first phase of the building in 1941. During the design process, several agencies expressed concern that the War Department had already expanded beyond the capacity of the building. These concerns turned out to be correct; while some offices of the War Department moved into the building for a few years, the building never became the War Department headquarters. By the time construction was complete, the War Department had already outgrown the building. Congress appropriated funds for construction of the Pentagon early in 1941, the same year the first phase of the building was completed. Instead, the structure was used for the Department of State. Although the original portion of the building is still commonly referred to as the War Department Building, it became home to the State Department by the late 1940s. World War II spurred the growth of this department as well. However, the planned expansion was delayed until Congress allocated funds for the addition in 1955. Harley, Probst Associates, a joint venture between Harley, Ellington, and Day of Detroit and Graham, Anderson, Probst, and White of Chicago, won the contract for the design in 1956. The addition, known as the State Department Extension, was completed in 1960 and dedicated in 1961. The original building was informally called \\"Old State\\" with the addition identified as \\"New State\\". 21st century East entrance to the Truman Building In September 2000, the State Department building (previously called the Main State Building, and often called by metonym \\"Foggy Bottom\\") was named in honor of President Harry S. Truman. Currently, more than 8,000 employees work in the Truman Building. The building houses of usable space, the corridors take up over , and the roof area is about . There are 44 elevators, over 4,000 windows, and about 34,000 fluorescent light fixtures that provide interior illumination. The building is currently being renovated under a 12-year plan to modernize the structure. In May 2014, the General Services Administration (GSA) awarded a $25 million contract to build a new public entrance on the east side of the Truman Building. The glass and steel structure will act not only as a high-security entrance to the building but also as a museum about American diplomacy. The addition, called the U.S. Diplomacy Center, was designed by the firm Beyer Blinder Belle, and is being constructed by Gilbane Construction. The addition is being privately funded by the Diplomacy Center Foundation, a nonprofit established by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in 2000 to honor American diplomats. The National Capital Planning Commission approved the design in 2011. Construction should be complete in 2016. GSA awarded a $77.4 million contract in September 2014 to renovate much of the rest of the structure. Some of the renovations will restructure the interior layout of the building to meet the State Department's needs. But most of the contract will focus on replacing the building's electrical, elevator, mechanical, plumbing, and telecommunication systems. The refurbishment will begin in January 2015 and take 14 months to complete. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. Architecture The original portion of the building, known as the War Department Building, is an example of the Stripped Classical architectural style with Art Moderne elements. The steel- framed building is clad in limestone and rises eight stories above the basement and sub-basement. Because it was designed to be expanded at a later date, it was deliberately asymmetrical. A central spine connects a U-shaped configuration to the east with an E-shaped configuration to the west. The east entrance is inspired by the main building of the Sapienza University of Rome campus, designed by italian architect Marcello Piacentini and completed in 1935. The horizontal delineations of the facade reflect the classical precedents of the architectural style. Cornices and pink granite string courses create a base-shaft-capital system. The wings create a series of interior courtyards. The interior courtyard walls are clad in dark granite, emphasizing the transition from base to shaft. The construction of the State Department Extension, completed in 1960, is reinforced concrete and was designed in the International style. Buff colored limestone cladding helps to create a cohesive combination of the two buildings. With the completion of the extension, the building became second to the Pentagon in the number of offices that it houses. Since its completion, access to the main ceremonial entrance and lobby is via the south elevation. The entrance is located off-center toward the west end of the building and is set back to frame a forecourt. The court is paved with a combination of gray and red granite. At either side of the forecourt, a limestone belt course runs the full width of the elevation above the basement and second stories. Limestone piers span the first and second stories. The East Lobby of the original building is a two-story rectangular space surrounded by a screen of paired piers. Four large pendant lights, which are original, are the primary light source. The floors are terrazzo and the walls are travertine. Above the security barriers at the rear of the lobby is a mural by Kindred McLeary entitled The Defense of Human Freedoms, which depicts the five freedoms flanked at either end of the mural by their defenders, the American military. Access to the auditorium is via the second floor. The Dean Acheson Auditorium extends upward from the first through the third stories. The stage spans the full east wall of the room. The walls on either side are clad in burled California redwood paneling. The Loy Henderson Conference Room is two stories tall. The walls are Verde Antique marble with brass and bronze accents. A speakers' platform, stepped up at the center, is set along the west wall. In the lobby of the fifth floor executive office suite is a mural by James McCreery entitled Liberty or Death: Don't Tread on Me. The work is an allegory of the American Revolution, including maps, cannon and other armament, and flags of the era. The eastern section of the fifth floor contains executive office suites for department heads and their staffs. The west side of the corridor includes staff offices and the general council room. The east side of the corridor includes office suites originally designated for the secretary of war and chief of staff. The south courtyard of the State Department Building features a sculpture by Marshall Fredericks entitled Man and the Expanding Universe, which includes a circular fountain and an architectural bronze statue. A treaty room and the ceremonial office of the Secretary of State is on the seventh floor. Diplomatic Reception Rooms were installed on the eighth floor during the 1980s as reproductions of early American architecture. They are furnished with eighteenth-century antique furnishings and eighteenth- and nineteenth-century artwork. See also * Herbert C. Hoover Building * Robert F.

The United States Courthouse, Tallahassee, Florida, is a courthouse of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida.Federal Judicial Center Historic Federal Courthouses page on the United States Courthouse in Tallahassee, Florida. Building history During the 1890s, the federal government funded construction of federal courthouses and post offices throughout the country. Supervising Architects of the Treasury Willoughby J. Edbrooke and Jeremiah O'Rourke prepared the architectural plans for Tallahassee's 1895 courthouse and post office building. Built on Park Avenue across the street from the Leon County Courthouse, it was demolished in 1964. The site of the current U.S. Courthouse was occupied by a county courthouse between 1838 and 1879. The Leon Hotel stood here from 1883 until it burned in 1925. During the Great Depression, a new post office and federal building was constructed on the site by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Established in 1935, the WPA was a nationwide employment program responsible for public works. Architect Eric Kebbon (1890-1964) designed Tallahassee's courthouse and the Beers Construction Company of Atlanta was the general contractor. Based in New York, Kebbon designed more than 100 public schools, and is noted for his work on the 1939 New York World's Fair Food Building with several other renowned architects, including Morris Ketchum, Jr. and Edward Durrell Stone. The courthouse's main lobby is decorated with eight murals illustrating scenes from Florida's history. The murals were funded by the Treasury Department's Section of Painting and Sculpture, a Depression-era program intended to employ artists. Hungarian-born American Edward \\"Buk\\" Ulreich (1889-1966) won a competition to paint the murals, which he completed in 1939. The building originally housed the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida, and served it as Tallahassee's main post office until the early 1970s. In 1979, the courthouse was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Park Avenue Historic District. The courthouse is now occupied by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Northern District of Florida. Architecture The Courthouse as it appears today. Built in 1935-1936 at a cost of $318,000, the U.S. Court-house features an understated combination of the Beaux Arts and Neoclassical styles. It was designed by Eric Kebbon, who also designed the 1937 C.F. Haynsworth Federal Building in Greenville, South Carolina. With funds limited during the Great Depression, the courthouse lacks the exuberant detailing typical of many Beaux Arts buildings. The Beaux Arts style is known for its classically inspired details, variety of stone finishes, and projecting pavilions with colossal columns and pedimented entablature on top. Characteristics of the Neoclassical style include symmetry, smooth stone surfaces, and colonnades. The courthouse has a granite foundation and the walls consist of limestone blocks. The overall massing and exterior design on all four elevations is simple, symmetrical, and classically inspired. The round-arched windows feature limestone keystones on the first story, while the second-story windows have heavy limestone frames culminating in keystones. Limestone belt courses extend along the first story and between the first and second stories. A cornice with an unadorned frieze and dentil molding runs below the roof's edge. Topping the hipped roof is a circular limestone cupola with Tuscan columns and copper roof with a brass finial. The principal embellishment is a central temple-front pavilion on the south facade, highlighted by a coursed limestone base pierced with arches and an upper-level portico with an arcade. On the first story, the central arch frames the double door entry. The second story includes Tuscan columns and a limestone balustrade. Above the columns, the pediment features a simple frieze with dentil-block molding and an oculus (round) window with limestone surround. The former postal lobby and main staircase are located at the south (main) entry. Original finishes include marble flooring and wainscoting, marble pilasters along the south wall, decorative crown molding, bronze ornaments and grills, and marble surrounds with keystones accenting the south wall's doors and windows. Marble writing tables and a bulletin board with marble surround are at the lobby's south wall. Below the north wall's crown molding are Ulreich's murals, depicting important events in Florida's history. The west and north walls have original brass six-panel doors with classically detailed surrounds. The lobby's original brass light fixtures with glass globes are typical of 1930s post offices. Faced with marble, the original curved staircase is at the lobby's southwest corner. Following the stairs' curve, the staircase railing has iron balusters with a wood cap and decorative bronze newels at each level. The two-story main courtroom is on the second floor. The courtroom lobby retains historic terrazzo floors, marble baseboards, wooden chair rails, and paneled doors. The courtroom itself features wood wainscoting and fluted Ionic pilasters supporting a massive wood entablature with a dentil cornice, all of painted white pine. Arched windows on the south wall have wood trim with a keystone and rosette corner blocks. Original furnishings include the judge's bench, jury box, court rail, and spectators' benches. In 2000, an annex was completed near the historic building to provide space for the U.S. District Court. In 2003-2004, the courthouse was subject to a $4 million renovation that included window and facade restoration, preservation of key areas such as judges' office suites, and remodeling of remaining areas for bankruptcy court, clerk, and trustee and U.S. Marshals use. Akin & Associates Architects, Inc. provided architectural design services, while Peter R. Brown Construction, Inc. was the general contractor. In 2005, the Tallahassee Trust for Historic Preservation recognized the project with an outstanding achievement award.

The Tatton family lived at from 1540 to 1926 Wythenshawe Hall, which is in Northern Moor; land around it is now Wythenshawe Park, which was a deer park from 1200 to 1540. In former centuries its name was spelled \\"Northen Moor\\" and meant \\"the moor area belonging to Northenden\\". Until the early 1900s Northern Moor was part of Cheshire, before Manchester expanded south of the River Mersey and the borders of Cheshire changed. Northern Moor and Northenden following the border changes has been part of Manchester instead of Cheshire. The current area called 'Northern Moor' now includes Lawton Moor, and the border of Northern Moor is now at the Sale moor border. The area has grown since the 1930s and 1940s to cover the area of the old Tatton family estate and farms. In 1926 Mr.Tatton (country squire at Wythenshawe Hall) sold much land in Wythenshawe, and it came into the hands of Manchester Corporation, which chose 4 farm fields in Northern Moor to be the Manchester (Wythenshawe) Aerodrome. Its runway opened in early 1929, with the old farm house used for offices. The airfield closed a few years later and moved to Eccles and became Barton Airport. The land was redeveloped with Rackhouse School opening in 1935, St. Michael's Church in 1937, St Aidan's Catholic School in 1938 and many houses built in the 1930s and 1940s on the land. Northern Moor has grown further since and expands to the Sale border. The area is now part of the Wythenshawe and Sale East Parliament constituency.  TV Programs  The ITV documentary series The Duchess On The Estate, filmed between February and July 2009 in Northern Moor, aired on TV on Tuesday 18 August and Tuesday 25 August 2009. The ITV soap Coronation street filmed for a number of weeks on location in Northern Moor including the Park Pub, the Pub car park and roads in the area. This was for the story line with Callum Logan and David Platt, in the run up to the live episode in September 2015.  Education  Local schools include Rack House Primary School (opened 1937 ), St. Aidan's Primary School (opened 1938) and Button Lane Primary School. Marcus Rashford the Manchester United football player was a former student at button lane primary school. The High School is located on the south border of the village. Northern Moor is also home to the Northenden campus of Manchester College. The Northern Moor Library has been located within the High School since 2014.  Transport  Tram: Northern Moor has two tram stops: Northern Moor Metrolink station and Wythenshawe park Metro station, both on the Manchester Airport line, services every 12 minutes to Manchester Victoria tramstop. This line opened in 2015. Bus: Northern Moor is on the 41 bus route linking Sale and Manchester. Northern Moor is also on the number 19 bus route (to Manchester Airport) and 108 (to Wythenshawe Hospital). Roads: Northern Moor has road links with both the M60 and M56 motorways. Manchester Airport is a 10-minute drive away.  Religion  Local churches include Lawton Moor Methodist Church, St. Michael Anglican Church, St Aidan's Catholic church and Northern Moor Community Church. St Aidan's Catholic school opened in 1938 with the church being built in 1955. St. Michael Church is a Grade 2 listed building and opened in 1937, the Church building was built in a shape of a star.  Economy  Northern Moor has two main shopping areas, a restaurant and 2 pubs. One shopping area is sale circle and the 2nd is Moor Croft. Tesco opened in 2019 at the Moor Croft shopping area. Northern Moor is mainly a residential area, with most people living there travelling to Manchester Airport, Manchester, Sale or Warrington to work.

Overlooking the ruins of Ishkanaberd and Lake Sevan. Khrber (Armenian: ‘Ω’º’¢’•÷Ä; Transliteration: x·πôbƒìr; also Karmrashen) is situated in the mountains 8 kilometers south-east from the ruins of the fortified Urartian city of Teyseba, also known as Odzaberd and Ishkanaberd. Geographically it is located at the south-east corner of Lake Sevan, which can be seen in the distance at a highpoint amongst the ruins. The name is derived from the local dialect of the villages near south-east Lake Sevan and roughly translates to ‚Äúruins‚Äù. It was once the location of an ancient town, but now only its ruins remain. Foundations of large rectangular stone structures, portions of fortified thick walls, and a large cemetery with ancient tombs, headstones, and khachkars may still be seen. The majority of the oldest graves are located at the base of a hill just south of the ruins of Khrber. Within the ruins, there is a memorial of seven khachkars named Yot Verk Matur meaning \\"Seven Wounds Chapel\\". It is from approximately the 14th century and is dedicated to seven lords of seven villages that died during this time. Another more ancient cemetery lies beyond the large foothill just south of Khrber. Folklore of Khrber Folklore from the village of Tsovinar tells that long ago the Lord of Khrber was married, and that the Lord of the city of Ishkanaberd, meaning ‚ÄúLord‚Äôs Castle‚Äù (located approximately 8 km away) wanted the other lord‚Äôs wife as his own even though he himself was already married. An affair ensued between the two, and soon the Lord of Khrber discovered this and became furious. He decided that he would destroy the city of Ishkanaberd, which was at that time considered impenetrable because of its very thick walls. The Lord of Ishkanaberd's wife also found out that an affair had been taking place between her husband and the other lord's wife. While the Lord of Ishkanaberd was sleeping, his own wife bound him so that he could not escape and went to let the Lord of Khrber into the walled city. The wife of the Lord of Khrber whom the other lord was having an affair with learned what had happened and came to free him. She did so and the two of them escaped with their lives that night from the city on horseback through a cave located a very short distance away from Ishkanaberd. The cave can still be seen to this day and the entrance is quite large. During that time it is said that the cave led from Ishkanaberd to a village some distance away, and that the cavern's tunnel which has since collapsed could fit a person sitting on horseback from one end to the other. The Lord of Khrber destroyed the fortified city of Ishkanaberd and said, ‚ÄúNow nothing shall live in this land except snakes and scorpions!‚Äù Therefore the name of the other city was referred to henceforth as Odzaberd meaning ‚ÄúSerpent‚Äôs Castle‚Äù.

Licensed to Lubbock, Texas, United States, the station serves the Lubbock area. The station is owned by Entravision Holdings, LLC. History A station at 1460 was activated by a couple of ex-KSEL sales reps in 1953. Their 500-watt daytimer had studios and tower at 52nd and Magnolia in southeast Lubbock. the assigned call letters were KVSP. In 1954, the station was sold to the McAlister and Maples interests (variously KICA CLovis, NM KGMC Englewood COlorado, KPOS Post, and KBYG Big SPring at various times). Studios were moved into a penthouse suite of the recently completed Great Plains Life Insurance Building, a 20-floor-tall building at 12th and Avenue L (then as now the tallest building in Lubbock). The call letters were changed to KLLL for \\"Lubbock's Liveliest Listening\\". In short order, the new owners raised power to 1,000 watts, still as a daytime-only station. KLLL (AM) was sold to the Corbin family in 1958. They purchased local FM station KBFM a decade later, and eventually changed calls from KBFM to KLLL-FM. The studio building was damaged in 1970 during the great Lubbock tornado and KLLL spent several days off air. They used the former KSEL studios on east Broadway (vacated in 1968 when KSEL moved to their new KSEL-TV sister station plant in South Lubbock). KLLL-FM returned to the air using the KSEL-TV tower. New KLLL studios were built at 1314 50th Street and were placed into use in 1976. In 1982, KLLL was spun off to local oilman Terry Wynn. KLLL call letters stayed with the FM and the FM company purchased 1590 AM (by then KEND because it was a full-time station), and 1460 changed its format to Adult Contemporary and its call letters to KWAZ for \\"Kwazy Way-dio\\". Studios moved to 3210-B 34th Street. 1460 asked the FCC for another fM channel (class A on 106.3 which was granted) and filed for the new channel (along with many others). The grant eventually went to the now KEJS (FM) which went on air in the late 1980s. The station received a construction permit in 1984 for a new transmitter site and new city of License of Carlisle, Texas. The new site would have required three new towers north and east of Lubbock. The site was never built. Some time later, the FCC granted day-timers use of night-time hours at appropriately reduced night powers. KWAZ became an early medium-market all-talk station, using network programs from ABC TalkRadio, and CNN Headline News Audio. One of the engineers in this time was Kyle Wesley (now director of engineering for Radio Disney and its owned and operated broadcast stations). The station was assigned the call sign KTLK in November 1983. On November 30, 1993,the station changed its call sign to KTNP, and on December 1, 1994, to the current KBZO. On September 8, 2019 The Format Was Flipped From Spanish Sports To Norte√±o Y Ranchera Music Jos√©.

The first Bah√° º√≠ to settle in the country came in 1953 from Uganda. The first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly of the country was elected in 1957. By 1963 there were 143 local assemblies in Congo. Even though the religion was banned, and the country torn by wars, the religion grew so that in 2003 there were some 541 assemblies. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 290,900 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. Early Phase  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s Tablets of the Divine Plan  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book Tablets of the Divine Plan. The eighth and twelfth of the tablets mentioned Africa and were written on April 19, 1916 and February 15, 1917, respectively. Publication however was delayed in the United States until 1919‚Äîafter the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. The tablets were translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° mentions Bah√° º√≠s traveling \\"...especially from America to Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, and travel through Japan and China. Likewise, from Germany teachers and believers may travel to the continents of America, Africa, Japan and China; in brief, they may travel through all the continents and islands of the globe\\" and \\" ...the anthem of the oneness of the world of humanity may confer a new life upon all the children of men, and the tabernacle of universal peace be pitched on the apex of America; thus Europe and Africa may become vivified with the breaths of the Holy Spirit, this world may become another world, the body politic may attain to a new exhilaration....\\" Shoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, and his wife, R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum may have been the first Bah√° º√≠s to visit Congo when they drove across the eastern part of the country in 1940. Establishment of the community In 1953 Shoghi Effendi planned an international teaching plan termed the Ten Year Crusade. This was during a period of wide scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa near the end of the period of Colonisation of Africa. Before 1953, colonial authorities of what was then the Belgian Congo did not permit the promotion of religion by Bah√° º√≠ pioneers however Ali Nakhjavani and his wife, Violette, driving across Africa from the growing Bah√° º√≠ community in Uganda, were able to take a Ugandan Bah√° º√≠ Samson Mungongo to the city of Kamina where he settled and began to teach the religion while suffering hostility, suspiciousness and superstition. The first converts were Louis Selemani, Remy Kalonji, and Valerien Mukendi - they, with a dozen pioneers from Europe, North America and other parts of Africa, and Congolese who had become Bah√° º√≠s in Rwanda and Burundi who moved back to their home provinces - all these formed the basis of the quickly growing community. In April 1956 the Bah√° º√≠ Faith was present in small numbers across countries of middle Africa. To administer these communities a regional National Spiritual Assembly was elected in Central and East Africa to cover them. The first Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1957. Growth and opposition The Eastern Belgian Congo, as part of the experience across central Africa west to east and to the south began to have qualities of mass conversion. In the areas under the jurisdiction of the regional National Assembly of South and West Africa, south of Congo, there was a gain of over sixty percent in the total number of adherents of the Faith just in 1959, and rates like this continued for a few more years. Pygmies in Congo were among the converts in 1961, one of whom was a delegate to the election of the regional assembly in 1962. Circa 1961 Bah√° º√≠ sources indicate about 1000 members. By the spring of 1962 there was widespread knowledge of many more Bah√° º√≠s and about November 1962 the National Spiritual Assembly of Central and West Africa was claiming over 14,000 people had converted to the religion. By the end of 1963 local assemblies were in 143 localities. The majority of growth happened in the province of Kivu Major growth was announced as early as 1962. Later some also occurred in the province of Shaba in the 1970s when the community grew from about 5 individuals to enough to support 25 local assemblies in 1973. Following the death of Shoghi Effendi, the elected Universal House of Justice was head of the religion and began to re-organized the Bah√° º√≠ communities of Africa by splitting off national communities to form their own National Assemblies from 1967 though the 1990s. From January to March 1970 Hand of the Cause R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum crossed Africa from east to west visiting many of these country's communities including the Congo, meeting with individuals and institutions both Bah√° º√≠ and civic. The first National Spiritual Assembly of Zaire (current name of the country) formed in 1970 during this trip. R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum's second visit was in January 1972 and traveled almost 3,000 miles through central and southern Zaire by river boat and automobile. Kivu Members of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith first entered the Province of Kivu about November 1959 from Uganda where the religion had grown quickly. Whole villages turned out to listen to presentations on the religion and growth continued through the 1960s. After visiting Zaire a couple times in the 1970s a third visit by R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum in late 1972 focused on the province of Kivu where the majority of Bah√° º√≠s of Zaire were to be found - some 600 assemblies being elected across some 30,000 Bah√° º√≠s in 1972 (compared to about 3000 Bah√° º√≠s in the rest of the Congo at the same time.) In fact most of these Bah√° º√≠s in Kivu were in the southern half of the province, or modern day South Kivu. In the Kivu region in a five-year period in the 1970s there were 9 women's conferences under the authority of assemblies or committees of assemblies, institutes were developed to train over 100 teachers for Bah√° º√≠ schools that were sanctioned by the government educational bureau. Restricted and freedom However, as part of a sweep across several Sub-Saharan countries, the Bah√° º√≠ Faith was banned in the 1970s in several countries: Burundi, 1974; Mali 1976; Uganda 1977; Congo, 1978; Niger, 1978. > \\"This was principally the result of a campaign by a number of Arab > countries.

In 1982 the Bah√° º√≠ Administrative Committee for Central South Zaire in Lubumbashi published a work commemorating Bah√≠yyih Kh√°num. Bah√° º√≠ pioneers continued to arrive. In 1983 a local TV program in Kivu featured a presentation on the religion was followed up by a showing of the filmThe Green Light Expedition about R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum's trip up the Amazon River. After some years of service and growth the Bah√° º√≠ community was able to re-elect its National Assembly in 1987. Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bah√° º√≠s were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bah√° º√≠ teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bah√° º√≠ socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In Zaire in 1983 a tutorial school in Bangwade, Upper Zaire was founded. A survey of projects in 1985 found: agriculture project and literacy center, Kawayongo under its local assembly, educational centers emphasizing functional literacy training for children and adults, augmented by health education and instruction on improving agricultural productivity, a program providing training in nutrition and preventive medicine in NE Zaire, a literacy training program in Goma, a project among the Pygmies to improve literacy and numeracy, health care and agriculture, a teacher training center in northeastern Zaire for French speaking Bah√° º√≠ teachers for children's classes, pre-schools and tutorial schools, a training program for the Baha'is to increase agricultural productivity and a project where three senior students from the University of Zaire trained in rural development would spend four months assessing community needs and teaching modern methods of animal keeping, the use of improved seeds, fish culture, and disease prevention methods. In 1986 the provincial governor visited a school project among the Bah√° º√≠ Pygmies. By 1987 the Bah√° º√≠s organized the Regional Committee for Social and Economic Development under the national assembly for the region of Kivu (using the acronym CREDESE). One hundred and two learning centers were reported in October 1987 operating under CREDESE. There were 2,500 participants across Kivu. Women and girls comprised 73 percent of the students, and 27 percent were not members of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. CREDESE was based on work from a Bah√° º√≠ Kenyan and Tanzanian project. In 1989 Bah√° º√≠s engaged in a study reviewing the effect of the religion in the prospects of fighting the growth of AIDS in Kinshasa. Modern community Having survived legal proscription, and periods of war, the Second Congo War prevented the national institution from meeting from 1998 to 2003. The Bah√° º√≠s have continued to develop internal and external projects. The Congo Baha'i Youth Choir sang at a devotional program at the base of the Terraces on Mount Carmel. It later evolved into the Celebration! Congo Choir which performed at The Kennedy Center in 2005. In 2000 some Bah√° º√≠s studied the relationship between the Bah√° º√≠ teachings and conservation efforts in the Congo. In 2012 the Universal House of Justice announced plans to build two national Bah√° º√≠ Houses of Worship aside from the continental ones. One of these was for the Democratic Republic of Congo. Demographics World Christian Encyclopedia estimated in 2000 there were 224,000 Bah√° º√≠s in the Congo. Association of Religion Data Archives estimated in 2001 that there were 0.4%, or about 250,000 Bah√° º√≠s. In 2003 there were some 541 assemblies. For many years the community was mostly male - but more recently about one third of Bah√° º√≠s are women. By 2005 the Association of Religion Data Archives revised their estimated to some 290,899 Bah√° º√≠s.

Early life Fowler was born in London on 8 June 1916. He was educated at Rugby School. His father was a Paymaster-Commander in the Royal Navy and he was great-grandson of Sir Henry Ayers, a Premier of South Australia for whom Ayers Rock was named. Fowler's family moved to Adelaide in South Australia in 1920, before returning to the UK in 1924 so Fowler could attend Rugby School. He returned to Australia in 1933, before enlisting in the Royal Australian Air Force in 1936, and then transferring to the Royal Air Force (RAF). Fighter pilot Fowler was granted a short-service commission in the RAF as a pilot officer on 19 February 1937. He was trained at No 6 Flying Training School at Netheravonhttp://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1937/1937%20-%200812.html before being posted to 3 Squadron on 22 May 1937.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1937/1937%20-%201540.html He then served as a fighter pilot with 615 Squadron commanded by Squadron Leader Joseph Kayll, flying the Gloster Gladiator. He joined the Squadron in October 1939 before converting to Hawker Hurricanes in May 1940. Fowler and 615 Squadron arrived in France in November 1939 as part of the Air Component of the BEF. When the German invasion of the west commenced on 10 May 1940, the Squadron was still converting onto Hurricanes, although they were in action from the very start. Fowler made his first 'kill' on 12 May 1940 when he shot down a Bf 109. This was also the Squadron's first kill.Note: An enemy aircraft had been claimed damaged by F/O L Fredman on 10 May 1940, but Fowler's kill was the first aircraft destroyed. He was credited with shooting down a Dornier Do 17 on 14 May 1940 as well, followed by another Bf 109 the next day. During the same engagement he was also shot down.'RAF Fighter Command Losses 1939-1941' by Norman Franks page 23 He bailed out and landed in the Ardennes Forest where he met some French soldiers retreating from the front line. However the next day, 16 May, the group was surrounded and forced to surrender. As a result, Fowler became a prisoner of war. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 3 September 1940 whilst in captivity. Prisoner of war Fowler was sent to Dulag Luft transit camp at Oberursel before being transferred to Stalag Luft I at Barth, arriving there on 5 July 1940. Stalag Luft I and first escape By November 1941, Fowler was acting as a distributor of Red Cross parcels. During his time in captivity Fowler had been making a bogus German uniform out of various bits of material and a civilian suit, smuggling them into the parcel office which was outside the main prisoners' compound. On 5 November 1941, he dressed in his bogus German uniform from the parcel office and climbed over the lightly guarded perimeter fence. Outside the camp he changed into his civilian suit. He managed to reach Sassnitz and attempted to stow away on a Swedish ship; but whilst at the docks he was arrested by a German policeman. He was returned to Stalag Luft I and sentenced to 14 days solitary confinement, before being transferred to the 'escape proof' camp Oflag IV-C at Colditz Castle, arriving on 1 December 1941.WO208/3282 Official Camp History SL1 - Chapter II para 17(d) Pete Tunstall claims that Fowler, whilst at Barth, was the first in WWII to use the term 'goons' to describe the guards, referencing a well-known comic strip. Tunstall claims the term caught like wildfire through all the prison camps in Germany. \\"Goons up\\" became a warning cry for approaching guards, \\"goon boxes\\" described the machine gun towers, any manmade uniforms used to escape were called \\"goon skins,\\" and their favourite recreation of winding the guards up become known as \\"goon baiting.\\" Colditz Castle and successful escape Colditz Castle During his time at Colditz, Fowler took part in 'goon baiting', which involved harassing and annoying the German guards as much as possible, under the able direction of Douglas Bader. For this, Fowler - as many others - spent time in solitary confinement. During August 1942 an escape plan was prepared for a party of officers moving through a short tunnel which started in the German Stabsfeldwebel's (sergeant major) office located near the prisoner's sick quarters. The starting location was chosen because it was a place unlikely to be thoroughly searched. Fowler was involved from the outset.'Colditz - The Full Story' by Pat Reid pages 162-165 The prisoners picked the office's lock and over a few nights built a tunnel which led from under the Stabsfeldwebel's desk to a clothing store with access to the outside. The tunnel was partly constructed by Captain Pat Reid.'The Colditz Story' by Pat Reid page 176 From the clothing store the prisoners were to leave the castle disguised as a work party removing clothes from the store, four to be dressed as Polish orderlies, one disguised as a German officer, the other as a German NCO. The six officers were Fowler, Captain Lulu Lawton (British Army), Lieutenant Geoff Wardle (Royal Navy) and three Dutch officers, Lt Beitz, Lt Donkers and Lt Damiaen Joan van Doorninck.WO208/3288 Official Camp History O4C - Chapter II para 21(k) The escape took place on 9 September 1942. All went well as the six escapers and two assistants entered the office during the previous evening and opened up the tunnel. However, around midnight there was an alarm and the Germans searched the castle. Fortunately for the prisoners, the office door had been relocked and this satisfied the searchers that nobody had entered the office.'The Colditz Story' by Pat Reid Page 179 After entering the clothing store the tunnel was sealed to allow later use (it was discovered the following day during the search for the missing officers). At 0730 the escape party left the store, timed to be shortly after the change of the German sentries; the idea being that the new sentries would be unaware of who had already entered the store. The party, led by van Doorninck (dressed as the German NCO), proceeded past several sentries and using a forged pass, left the castle unaccosted. Outside the camp the party changed into civilian clothes and separated, Fowler travelling with van Doornick. They travelled on foot to Penig (about 31 km) and from there by train to Plauen via Zwickau. They caught the train to Stuttgart where they stayed overnight in a small hotel. The next day they caught a train to Tuttlingen and walked to the Swiss border. En route they were stopped by an SS policeman, but their forged papers were sufficient to pass inspection. They crossed into Switzerland at 0130 on 13 September 1942, and were taken to the British legation at Bern.WO208/3288 Official Camp History O4C - Chapter X para 3 The other four escapers were recaptured close to Colditz.  Return to the UK  Fowler left Switzerland on 25 January 1943 and with Major Ronald B. Littledale, who had escaped from Colditz with Pat Reid, travelled across unoccupied France into Spain on 30 January 1943. They were arrested by the Spanish authorities later the same day. They were taken to a military prison at Figueras and held in filthy and cramped conditions until 22 February 1943. They were then taken to the British Consul in Barcelona from where they travelled to Gibraltar, arriving on 25 March 1943. Fowler returned to the UK shortly afterwards. For his successful escape, Fowler was awarded the Military Cross, which was gazetted on 14 December 1943. Death On reaching the UK, Fowler was promoted to squadron leader, and posted to the Armament Test Squadron at Boscombe Down to act as a test pilot. He was killed during an air test flying a Hawker Typhoon on 26 March 1944. The Typhoon disintegrated following a dive, killing Fowler. He was buried at Durrington cemetery.http://www.cwgc.org/find-war- dead/casualty/2709963 Notes  References   Category:1916 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Military personnel from London Category:British escapees Category:British World War II prisoners of war Category:Recipients of the Military Cross Category:Royal Air Force officers Category:English aviators Category:British World War II pilots Category:World War II prisoners of war held by Germany Category:Shot-down aviators Category:Prisoners of war held at Colditz Castle Category:British military personnel killed in World War II Category:People educated at Rugby School Category:Aviators killed in aviation accidents or incidents in England ","title":"Hedley Fowler"},{"id":"24078476","text":"KDBN (101.1 FM, \\"KSUN\\") is an American radio station licensed to serve the community of Parachute, Colorado.

The type species is Orthoceras richteri Barrande, 1874, which comes from the Upper Silurian Ludlow Series of the Prague Basin, Czech Republic.Evans, David H. 2000. A Cephalopod Fauna from the Middle Ordovician of Saudi Arabia. Palaeontology, Vol. 43, Part 3, 2000, pp. 573-589. Hyatt named Sactoceras for actinocerid species in which siphuncle segments were much reduced in diameter relative to the diameter of the shell, noting that the \\"siphon becomes approximately reduced . . . with age\\", which he interpreted as a \\"degradational senile shrinking\\". Barrande (according to Foord (1888)) considered this to indicate a reversion to the simple siphuncle of the Orthoceratidae, which might be taken to indicate a relationship to the Proteoceratidae. Evans (2000) considered Sactoceras to be an orthocerid, placing it in the Pseudorthoceratoidea (originally Pseudorthoceratacea) of Flower and Caster, 1935, and in the family Sactoceratidae of Troedsson, 1926. The Pseudorthocerataceae is now generally regarded as a separate order, the Pseuorthocerida, within the superorder Orthoceratoidea of Wade, 1988.Wade, Mary 1988. Nautiloids and their descendants: cephalopod classification in 1988. New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources Memoir 44, October 1988. Morphology Sactoceras is orthoconic, essentially straight-shelled. The cross section of the shell (or conch) and that of the siphuncle are essentially circular. The shell is moderate in size, reaching diameters of 35mm or so, and expanding at a rate of around 6 to 9 degrees. Chambers (camerae) are moderately long with septal spacing on the order of one-third (1/3) the shell diameter. Sutures are straight, transvese. Septal concavity varies from species to species. The siphuncle is central to subcentral in the early part of the phragmocone, but may diverge away from the center in later growth stages. Segments are expanded, increasing from diameters of around 3 to 4 mm at the septal foremina to a maximum width of around 12 to 14 mm. Septal necks are cyrtochoanitic, outwardly curved and recumbent. Siphuncle segments, in some, are faintly tear-shaped in outline with the narrow end pointing back toward the apex. Deposits of organic calcite form at the septal formina which project forward into the subsequent chamber and line the inside of the siphuncle. These are more continuous on the ventral side of the siphuncle. Cameral deposits are also more extensive in the ventral half of the phragmocone. Fossil distribution Fossil distribution is found from North America to Europe and Asia.

It was established in 1871 as a rural cemetery, expanding on an early burial ground. The cemetery is built on a small hill in an otherwise flat area. The landscape was manipulated to create a system of perimeter roads and plantings, characteristics that show an advanced understanding of the rural cemetery aesthetic by its unknown designer(s). Its focal point, near the top of the hill, is a small wooden chapel with a memorial vault in the basement. Its monuments and funerary art, in a variety of styles, reflect the prosperity of Millville in the late 19th century. In 2007 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the second cemetery in the county with that distinction after Mount Albion Cemetery outside Albion. Grounds The cemetery is a parcel on the east side of West Shelby Road in the Town of Shelby, approximately one mile (1.6 km) south of Maple Ridge Road (NY 31A) at the hamlet of Millville, and a thousand feet (300 m) north of East Shelby's intersection with Martin and Wheeler roads. Medina, several miles to the northwest, is the nearest large settlement. The area is rural, with open worked fields and houses clustered near the road. The cemetery is built on a small hill that rises above the surrounding level terrain. On the road side, the cemetery is delineated by a retaining wall of locally quarried red Medina sandstone in an ashlar pattern. At the center an ornate iron arch on brick piers with \\"Millville Cemetery\\" spelled out on top allows access to the narrow gravel road going up the hill. It is one of four that cross the cemetery east-west to a parallel gravel road in the rear. The plantings, primarily large evergreen trees, proceed in regular rows across the property. Near the hilltop, to the northwest of the center of the cemetery, is the chapel. It is a wood frame Gothic Revival building that serves as a chapel, office and receiving vault. It is a one-and- a-half-story structure on a Medina sandstone foundation, built into the hill and also used as a vault. Sided in clapboard, it is topped with a cross-gabled roof shingled in asphalt. Each side has, along the ground floor, a single double-hung sash window and jigsaw-cut tracery vergeboards. A door on the south side with simple bracketed hood is the main entrance. It opens into a single large room with varnished beaded walls and simple wood trim. The oldest of the 197 graves, dating to the 1820s, are found in the original burying ground at the northwest corner. All others date from the cemetery's establishment to the present, with most predating 1950. They range from simple marble slabs to obelisks, sarcophagi and some custom designs. The most unusual is a tall hexagonal obelisk with Gothic Revival detailing in white marble. All decedents are local. History Millville grew starting in the 1810s through its access to the water power of Fish Creek and two other streams nearby. In its early years, its name was evident from the three sawmills, gristmill and turning mill in the settlement. Later, the clearing of land for farms reduced the flow of the streams and it could not support as many mills. By 1870, it had a school, post office, churches, shops and stores amid about 30 houses. Residents incorporated the Millville Cemetery Association to expand the old burying ground south of the hamlet into a cemetery. It was opened in 1871, and by 1873 the receiving vault had been built into the hillside. Records from that time period do not say who designed the cemetery. It seems from what was built that the designer or cemetery trustees had a well-formed understanding of the rural cemetery concept to apply it effectively. Its use of one of the few significant rises in an otherwise flat area, the landscaping and roads and the plantings make it an exemplary vernacular rural cemetery. The only significant change to the original design was the addition of the chapel building. The association's trustees decided to build it over the vault in 1893. They selected a design by Joseph Campbell the following year, and it was finished by December 1894 at a total cost of $459 ($ in contemporary dollars). There have been no changes since then save the addition of more graves.

Frost crack is distinct from sun scald and sun crack and physically differs from normal rough-bark characteristics as seen in mature oaks, pines, poplars and other tree species. Normal bark formation Sycamore bark with normal sloughing plates The sloughing or peeling of the bark is a normal process, especially in the spring when the tree begins to grow. The outer layers of the bark are dead tissue and therefore they cannot grow, the outer bark splitting in order for the tree to grow in circumference, increasing its diameter. The inner bark cambium and phloem tissues are living, and form a new protective layer of cells as the outer bark pulls apart. Normal furrowed bark has a layer of bark over the wood below, however bark may peel or fall off the tree in sheets (river birch), plates (sycamore and pine), strips (cedar) or blocks (dogwood). Causes Frost cracks are frequently the result of some sort of weakness in the bark which occurred to the tree earlier. In late winter and early spring, water in the phloem, known as the inner bark and in the xylem, known as the wood, expands and contracts under often significantly fluctuating temperatures. Wood that is in some way damaged does not contract to the same degree as healthy wood. Rapid expansion and contraction of water within the wood and bark, particularly under rapidly falling night temperatures, can result in a frost crack, often accompanied by a loud explosive report.Winter Sunscald and Frost Cracking Research suggests that the main cause is actually 'frost-shrinkage' due to the freezing-out of cell wall moisture into lumens of wood cells. Other causes are the expansion of freezing water in cell lumens, and additionally the formation of ice lenses within wood. As stated, previous defects such as healed wounds, branch stubs, etc. in tree trunks function as stress raisers and trigger the frost cracking.Mechanism of Frost Crack inTrees In winter when the sun sets or the sky clouds over, the temperature of the tree drops very quickly and as the bark cools more quickly and the wood contracts more slowly, the bark rips open in a long crack, sometimes with an audible report likened to a rifle crack.The Climate near the GroundLudington Daily NewsHome Hort hints. Cold, clear, sunny days are the most likely to result in frost cracking, particularly as the heat energy from the low Sun on a Winter day can be higher than any other time of year. Trees that are growing in poorly drained sites are more subject to frost cracking than are those growing in drier, better drained soils.Frost crack in Maple Trees suddenly left exposed by felling are highly susceptible.The Climate near the Ground Frost crack examples File:Frost crack initiation point.JPG|Initiation point of a frost crack on ash File:Frost crack termination.JPG|Termination of a frost crack File:Frost crack extent.JPG|An extreme repeated frost crack File:Frost crack and wood.JPG|Close up of a frost crack with callus and bare timber Physical appearance ash tree Frost crack in horse-chestnut bark Although frost cracks may be up to several metres long, these cracks usually only become apparent in early spring; they are often found on the southwest side of the tree. These cracks may heal in the summer and be reopen again in the winters, so that successive cracking and healing over a number of years results in the formation of 'frost ribs' on the sides of affected trees. The wood beneath the frost crack is rarely damaged.Home Hort hints. The cracks usually originate at the base of the trunk and extends from a metre to several metres upwards.Frost crack in Maple Some discoloration is often found at the site of the damage.Tree Dictionary Effect of damage Frost cracks often act as sites of entry for wood decay organisms, including insects, fungi and bacteria. Timber damaged in this way is unsuitable for use in buildings, etc. Tree species susceptibility Bark of a pine tree showing normal sloughing of plates of bark Species such as crab-apple, beech, walnut, oaks, maples, sycamore, horse-chestnut, willows and lime are prone to developing frost crack given the right conditions. Prevention Avoiding the use of fertilizers late in the growing season can reduce the incidence of splits, also protecting the bark of young trees from physical damage such as that caused by lawn mowers, car bumpers, grazing animals, spades, strimmers, etc. Protect young trees in winter with paper tree wrap from ground level to the first main branches. Repair Most tree species try to seal the edges of wounds by forming a callus layer. The wound's edges begin to form this callus during the first growing season after that crack appears and the callus layer will continue to grow and after many years, the wound may close over entirely.Home Hort hints.

He served as Bishop of Portland, Maine from 1974-88. Biography Edward O'Leary was born in Bangor, Maine, and studied at Holy Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts, from where he obtained his Bachelor's degree. He attended St. Paul's Seminary in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, there earning a Licentiate of Sacred Theology. Returning to Maine, he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Joseph Edward McCarthy on June 15, 1946. O'Leary was a curate at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception before serving at Sacred Heart Church of Portland and at St. Margaret's Church in Old Orchard Beach. He was later named chancellor of the Diocese of Portland, and a Domestic Prelate by Pope John XXIII in 1959. He was pastor of St. Charles Borromeo Church in Brunswick from 1967 to 1971. On November 16, 1970, O'Leary was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Portland and Titular Bishop of Moglaena by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on January 25, 1971 from Bishop Peter Leo Gerety, with Bishops Bernard Joseph Flanagan and Lawrence Graves serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. Following the promotion of Bishop Gerety to Archbishop of Newark in April 1974, O'Leary was named to succeed him as the ninth Bishop of Portland on October 16, 1974. He was formally installed on December 18 of that year. During his tenure, O'Leary was forced to address the problems of an increasing population but a decline in priestly vocations. He encouraged the greater involvement of laity and women in church administration, and developed a system of parish councils. The Portland Diocese also joined the Maine Council of Churches during this time. O'Leary took frequent public stands on a number of social issues of importance to the Church, endorsing a referendum on pornography and opposing the Maine Equal Rights Amendment (which he believed would enforce taxpayer-funded abortions). He also targeted AIDS victims for the Church's social services program. It was also customary for Bishop O'Leary to visit all the hospitals every Christmas Day. Last years and death After fourteen years as bishop, O'Leary retired due to health reasons on September 27, 1988. He later died at age 81. He was brother of the sister-in-law of Bishop Thomas Vose Daily. He remained Bishop Emeritus of Portland until his death on April 2, 2002.

It was built to house offices of the United States Customs Service. Building history The impressive U.S. Custom House symbolizes Savannah's importance to Georgia's import-export trade during the 18th and 19th centuries. The site is also significant in Savannah's history. A wood- frame residence used by James Edward Oglethorpe, founder (in 1733) of the Colony of Georgia and designer of Savannah's town plan, was previously on the site. The federal courthouse and the Tabernacle, where John Wesley preached his first sermon in America, were located on the rear of this lot. Savannah's first U.S. Custom House opened in 1789 on Commerce Row on East Bay Street. The second, opened in 1819 on East Bryan Street, burned in 1837. In 1845 the federal government purchased a site at East Bay and Bull Streets for a third U.S. Custom House. New York architect John S. Norris (1804‚Äì1876) served as designer and supervisor of construction. The building was the first of eighteen commissions Norris designed while living in Savannah from 1846 to 1861. The cornerstone was laid on July 20, 1848. The building was completed in 1852 and had the U.S. Post Office in the basement, the Customs Service on the first floor, and the federal courts on the second floor. The notorious case involving the yacht Wanderer was tried here in 1860. It was the last documented violation of the law against the importation of slaves. U.S. control of the building temporarily halted in January 1861 when the Confederate flag was raised above it the day after the Georgia State Convention adopted the Ordinance of Secession. In 1864 General William T. Sherman occupied Savannah and returned control of the building to the Union. In 1889 Colonel John H. Deveaux worked in the building as the first African American U.S. Customs Collector. Custom House, April 1936 The U.S. Custom House was designated as a contributing building in the Savannah National Historic Landmark District in 1966. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Architecture Constructed entirely of stone, the U.S. Custom House in Savannah represents John Norris' advocacy of fireproof construction, an interest fully supported by the city, which had experienced several devastating fires over its short history. Norris' interest in fire protection was instrumental in changing the construction methods and physical appearance of buildings in Savannah through the use of materials such as brick and stone. The U.S. Custom House opened in 1852, four years after construction began. On June 5, 1852 the Savannah Journal reported: \\"It must be said that if our Custom House was a long time growing, it has grown to be a perfect thing at last.\\" The monumental Greek Revival U.S. Custom House is sited at the corner of Bull and East Bay Streets. A distinctive cast-iron fence with balusters in the design of a closed tobacco leaf and fleur-de-lis surrounds the building. The building is eleven bays wide by five bays deep and constructed of 32-inch blocks of load-bearing, gray granite stones quarried in Quincy, Massachusetts. A pedimented portico supported by six monolithic columns dominates the main facade. These columns, estimated to weigh between 15 and 20 tons each, were freighted from Massachusetts lashed to the decks of ships. It reportedly took 30 days to transport the columns from the riverbank to the site and an additional 30 days to raise them into position. The fluted columns have capitals elaborately carved with a tobacco leaf motif. The striking granite stair provides access to the ceremonial public entrance. An unadorned entablature spans the building and the words \\"United States Custom House\\" are inscribed into the frieze of the pediment. The focal point of the interior is the magnificent solid granite stair at the center of the first floor. It is constructed so that each step locks into the next without obvious perpendicular support. A massive granite octagonal column at the basement level provides the necessary structural support for the stair. The stair's distinctive cast-iron railing consists of balusters displaying the same closed tobacco leaf motif seen on the exterior and newel posts replicating the massive granite columns on the primary exterior elevation. A semi-circular rotunda encases the stairwell and original wood panel doors follow the curvature of the surrounding walls. Still serving its original purpose with few changes over one hundred fifty years, the U.S. Custom House is a monument to Savannah's historic importance as a port city.

Early life and career Darboven was born in 1941 in Munich. She grew up in R√∂nneburg, a southern suburb of Hamburg, as the second of three daughters of C√§sar Darboven and Kirsten Darboven. Her father was a successful and well-to-do businessman in Hamburg; the family brand Darboven coffee is well known in Germany.# Giuseppe Panza: Memories of a Collector ‚Äì Abbeville Press ‚Äì Following a brief period in which she studied as a pianist, Darboven studied art with Willem Grimm, Theo Garve and Almir Mavignier at the Hochschule f√ºr bildende K√ºnste Hamburg from 1962 to 1965. From 1966 to 1968, she lived in New York City, at first in total isolation from the New York art scene. She then moved back to her family home in Hamburg and continued to live and work there among an extraordinary collection of disparate cultural artefacts until her death in 2009. Work Konstruktionen In the winter of 1966‚Äì1967, she met Sol LeWitt, Carl Andre and Joseph Kosuth, major figures in the then nascent fields of Minimalism and Conceptual art. These meetings proved pivotal in the development of Darboven's work; soon thereafter, she began her first series of drawings on millimeter paper with lists of numbers, which resulted from complicated additions or multiplications of personally derived numerical sequences based on the four to six digits used to notate the date, month, and year of the standard Gregorian calendar.Hanne Darboven: Wunschkonzert, December 15, 2010 ‚Äì January 29, 2011 Regen Projects, Los Angeles. The calendar sequence has consistently formed the basis for the majority of her installations, and the ‚Äòdaily arithmetic‚Äô consisting of checksums came to replace the year‚Äôs calendrical progression according to a complex and challenging mathematical logic. Always written out by hand, her paperwork thus comprised rows and rows of ascending and descending numbers, u-shapes, grids, line-notations and boxes.Hanne Darboven Galerie Klosterfelde, Berlin, May 2nd ‚Äî July 11th 2009. Accessed 30 January 2011. Employing this neutral language of numbers and using pen, pencil, the typewriter, and graph paper as materials, she began to make simple linear constructions of numbers that she called Konstruktionen. Similar to On Kawara, Darboven offered a system to represent time as both the continuous flux of life and clear embracing order. Along with LeWitt and Andre, Lucy Lippard and Kasper K√∂nig belonged to the circle of long-standing promoters of Darboven's work. In the 1970s, Darboven often allied her work, which she considered a form of writing, to the accomplishments of writers such as Heinrich Heine and Jean-Paul Sartre, directly transcribing quotations or entire passages of their texts, or translating them into patterns. By 1978, Darboven was also incorporating visual documents, such as photographic images and assorted objects that she found, purchased, or received as gifts. Doing so, she addressed specifically historical issues. The monumental work entitled Vier Jahreszeiten (Four seasons) (1981), which Darboven exhibited at Documenta 7 in Kassel, was the first of Darboven's works to be really permeated with color, introduced into it by the use of kitsch postcards.Annelie Phlen (April 1, 1983), Hanne Darboven's Time: The Content of Consciousness Artforum, pp. 52-53. Also in 1978, she first conceived her first large-scale installations.Hanne Darboven, Vita Galerie Crone, Berlin. Accessed 30 January 2011. Ever since, Darboven's work has often occupied large spaces: her installation Cultural History 1880‚Äì1983, (1980‚Äì1983) with its 1,589 individually framed works on paper of uniform format and 19 sculptural elements takes up 7,000 square feet.Grace Glueck (May 2, 2001), Popular Sizes in Art: Large and Xtra Large New York Times. Reducing the Gregorian calendrical notation to only forty-two denominations for each century,Lauren Sedofsky (March 1, 1997), [Hanne Darboven: Dia Center for the Arts - artist Hanne Darboven's work, 'Kulturgeschichte 1880‚Äì1983'] Artforum. the work weaves together cultural, social, and historical references with autobiographical documents, postcards, pinups of film and rock stars, documentary references to the first and second world wars, geometric diagrams for textile weaving, a sampling of New York doorways, illustrated covers from news magazines, the contents of an exhibition catalogue devoted to postwar European and American art, a kitschy literary calendar, and extracts from some of Darboven's earlier works.Hanne Darboven: Cultural History 1880-1983 MIT Press. An example of Darboven's work during her most prolific period is Sunrise / Sunset, New York, NYC, today. The work has been made in 1984 and consists of 385 drawings of felt pen on graph paper. The size is 31 x 35 cm each. The first drawing of each month is decorated with a nostalgic postcard showing prominent spots and picturesque scenes of past New York. The first drawing of each month is titled heute (\\"today\\"). All other days of the month are numbered consecutively. The total work is hung in monthly blocks of 30 or 31 day-drawings additional to the introductory postcard-drawing. Altogether the work represents a time period of living and working and at the same time evokes nostalgic memories of the past. Less minimalist, South Korean Calendar, 1991 presents pages from a South Korean calendar, with the days of the month marked in large Roman numerals that occasionally turn from black to red or blue for no obvious reason. The numerals are filled with a lacelike pattern of white dots and surrounded by a host of colorful details: little blue drawings of diamond rings and stainless steel wristwatches, yin-yang signs, elegant Korean characters.Pepe Karmel (September 29, 1995), Hanne Darboven 'South Korean Calendar, 1991' New York Times. Mathematical Music In the 1980s, Darboven further expanded her scope by including musical arrangements and photographs in her displays.Hanne Darboven MoMA Collection. In her so-called ‚ÄúMathematical Music‚Äù, she converted the numbers contained in her rows and columns into sounds. Numbers were assigned to certain notes, and numerical series translated into musical scores. With the aid of a collaborator, Darboven adapted them into performable compositions for organ, double bass, harpsichord, string quartet, and chamber orchestra. She translated her additive concept of dates into musical scores, in which the digit 1 stands for the note e, 2 for f, 3 for g, etc. Compound numbers are expressed as an interval of two notes, e.g. 31=g-e, 24=f-h, etc., and numbers combined with 0 are used as broken chords.Hanne Darboven Quartett 88, March 17, 1990 - April 16, 1990 Portikus, Frankfurt. Hanne Darboven: ‚ÄòMy systems are numeric concepts that work according to the laws of progression and/or reduction in the manner of a musical theme with variations.‚Äô Wende 80 (Turning point 80) (1980), using an interview with Helmut Schmidt and Franz Josef Strauss, is the first piece in Darboven's work which is simultaneously a musical score. This music is preserved on 11 long-playing records in a black case (an edition of 250 was pressed). Originally shown in Documenta 11 (2002) as a collection of loose pages in folders, the monumental Wunschkonzert (1984) consists of 1008 pages of uniform size divided into 4 Opus's (Opus 17a and b and Opus 18a and b). Each Opus comprises 36 poems, and each poem is made of 6 pages plus a title page on which an antiquarian greeting card celebrating a Christian confirmation has been collaged. The poems reveal a rhythmic movement in their increasing and decreasing rows of numbers, and the checksum values are represented in digits and line-notations (17a, 18a) or by digits entered into a grid (17b, 18b). This work adopts musical methods of movement and repetitive rhythms and was conceived against the backdrop of musical compositions by the artist. Legacy Established in 2000 and named after its founder, the Hanne Darboven Foundation promotes contemporary art by supporting young talents, which, in particular, tackle the theme of ‚Äòspace and time‚Äô in the realms of conceptual art, visual arts, compositions, and literature.Hanne Darboven Stiftung Official Website. The heir of the artist's estate, the foundation recorded Darboven‚Äôs complete Requiem Cycle. In order to preserve the artist's work and make parts of her own collection available to the public, the foundation purchased her former R√∂nneburg residence in 2012.Hanne Darboven Stiftung erwirbt Wohnhaus der K√ºnstlerin Monopol, July 17, 2012. Exhibitions Hanne Darboven‚Äôs works have been presented in numerous exhibitions in Germany and abroad. Her first solo exhibition outside Germany took place at Art & Project, Amsterdam, in 1970. The exhibition of her two- part work Card Index: Filing Cabinet (1975), simultaneously held in two New York galleries in 1978, was the first time that Darboven had shown her work in the United States, following a decision to stop exhibiting temporarily in 1976.Hanne Darboven, Card Index: Filing Cabinet, Part 2 (1975) Tate, London. Darboven has since had numerous one-person exhibitions primarily in Europe and North America, including major presentations at the Deichtorhallen, Hamburg; the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven; and the Dia Center for the Arts, New York. Individual works by Darboven were already included in the Documenta 5, 6 and 7, and in 1982 she represented the Federal Republic of Germany at the Venice Biennale (along with Gotthard Graubner and Wolfgang Laib). At the Documenta 11 her oeuvre was shown in all its many facets on three floors of the Fridericianum in Kassel, making it the \\"centerpiece of the exhibition\\" with more than 4,000 drawings.Michael Kimmelman (June 18, 2002), Global Art Show With an Agenda New York Times. Darboven's work was first shown by Galerie Konrad Fischer. Gallerist Leo Castelli gave her nine shows between 1973 and 1995.John Russell (June 7, 1996), Color Sets the Tempo, and Numbers Go Ticktock New York Times. Count Panza bought several of her works.

It was built between 1894 and 1899, and substantially enlarged in 1932. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 as Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse, and was renamed in honor of the Creek Indian leader Tomochichi in 2005. Building history Tomochichi Federal Building and United States Courthouse The building is located on a prominent site within the city's National Historic Landmark District. The building occupies an entire city block bounded by Bull, York, Whitaker, and State streets, adjacent to Wright Square. The building makes an important visual contribution architecturally to the city due to the high quality of its design and materials, and as such is individually listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Designed in the Second Renaissance Revival style, with richly carved ornamentation, it is one of the most distinguished and imposing buildings of its era in Savannah. The building was constructed primarily to house the Savannah post office, which was previously located in the U.S. Custom House. In 1889, work had just begun on a new post office at the corner of York and Abercorn Streets when construction was suspended because the citizens of Savannah wanted a \\"more suitable\\" building than the one originally planned. As a result, the U.S. Congress was persuaded to appropriate additional funds for the new post office, and in 1894, excavations began at a new site in the southern half of the block now entirely occupied by the building. This site itself was notable in Savannah's history as the former location of a courthouse where John Wesley, founder of Methodism, had preached in 1736 and 1737. The original building was designed between 1893 and 1894, during W. J. Edbrooke's tenure as Supervising Architect of the Treasury. The building cornerstone lists Jeremiah O'Rourke as the architect. Originally designated as the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse, the structure was later renamed the Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse. By July 30, 1899, all departments of the post office were in the new government building. It also housed the U.S. Courts, the U.S. Engineers, and the U.S. Weather Bureau. The building was enlarged between 1930 and 1932, when it was extended north to encompass the remainder of the block. Today, the building serves as offices for the U.S. District Court and Court-related functions. Architecture The courthouse in 1899, prior to renovations which more than doubled its size. Designed in the Second Renaissance Revival style, the original portion of the building is constructed entirely of white Georgia marble, and features the typical Italianate tripartite facade divisions characteristic of the style. The richly varied fenestration is one of the most prominent characteristics of the building. Various forms are skillfully used, resulting in distinct yet unified facade treatments. The original portion of the Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse (visible on the York Street side and in the southernmost bay on Bull Street) is a richly ornamented, rectilinear building, to which an L-shaped wing was added in 1932 to form the current U-shaped plan. The main facade of the original building faced President Street. In the 1930s, President Street was closed and the building was extended north to State Street, enlarging it to over twice its original size. The 1932 addition was executed in marble with terra cotta ornamentation emulating the marble detailing of the original building. The building is three stories in height, with a granite/ashlar foundation. On both the original building and the 1932 addition, scale is carefully manipulated as the building rises on the exterior-from the heavily rusticated base with massive semicircular arched openings, to the third floor where triple arched openings are used to give the appearance of a colonnade. The building's exterior ornamentation, both that executed in marble on the original portion of the building and the terra-cotta detailing on the extension, is rich and varied. Motifs relating to nature‚Äîincluding flowers, animals, and fruit-are incorporated into the frieze (the carved band below the eaves) alternating with medallions of variously colored marble. Similar motifs are repeated above certain windows and at the bases of the main entrance arches. Two carved faces (one on the north facade and one on the south) are traditionally said to be likenesses of the architect, Jeremiah O'Rourke. Arched entrance openings, which occur singly, in pairs, or tangentially connected, on the street level of the building give the appearance of an arcade. On the second level, flat- topped windows are recessed in double-arched openings, continuing themes established on the street level. These arched openings are successfully mixed with flat-topped window openings. The third level displays an even more intricate composition of forms. Here, flat-topped windows recessed in triple- arched openings are combined with flat-topped windows topped with elaborately carved semicircular panels. These latter openings, which are hung singly and in triplicate, provide continuous visual unification of patterns and forms. The elaborate carvings over many of the openings are similar to the stylized motifs found elsewhere on the building. The walls terminate in a Corinthian entablature consisting of an elaborate frieze, dentil course, and bracketed cornice. The red pantile roof with tile cresting and ornamental ball finials was manufactured by the well-known Ludowici Roof Tile Company. One particularly imposing feature of the building is a 150-foot marble bell tower rising from the north center of the original 1899 building. The tower is square in plan with two levels of open loggias near the top. These loggias are arcaded with colored marble disks above the architrave on the first level, and arched openings with a bracketed balcony on the second. Top portion of the Bell Tower of the Tomochichi Federal Building in Savannah Although the interior has been substantially renovated to accommodate various tenants through the years, original materials-including 1899 fireplace mantles in some rooms on the upper floors of the south wing-are still evident in parts of the building. In other areas, later dropped ceilings have been removed, returning many rooms to their original height and exposing original window transoms. In the 1980s a new courtroom was constructed in the first floor postal work area of the 1899 building. In 1995, the attic was converted to a fitness center with a cathedral ceiling. Recent U.S. General Service Administration preservation efforts include restoration of the third floor courtroom in the 1932 addition and replication of historic lighting in the 1899 lobbies.

Completed in 1908, it initially served as a courthouse of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, until the creation of the Middle District in 1926. It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1972 as \\"Old U.S. Post Office and Federal Building\\", and also is included in the NRHP-listed Macon Historic District. It was renamed in honor of district court judge William Augustus Bootle in 1998. Building history In 1896, the rapidly growing city of Macon, Georgia, needed a larger post office and courthouse. After much debate, officials decided to construct a new building rather than expand an existing federal courthouse. However, Judge Emory Speer refused to vacate that building, insisting that only an addition was necessary and major construction would disrupt the court. Speer resisted for years, but the original building was finally demolished in 1906. James Knox Taylor, Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury Department, designed the new building in the Beaux Arts Classicism style, which he believed conveyed the dignity of the Federal government. By September 1908, the building was completed. The post office occupied the first floor, and courtrooms and judges' chambers were on the second floor. The building was renamed the William Augustus Bootle Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in 1998 to honor one of Georgia's most important judges who presided there. President Dwight Eisenhower appointed Judge Bootle to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia in 1954. Judge Bootle was responsible for several landmark civil rights rulings in the state. In 1961, he ordered the University of Georgia to admit two African-American students, Hamilton Holmes and Charlayne Hunter, who were denied admission because of race. The case, Holmes v. Danner, had a major impact on integrating higher education in Georgia. Judge Bootle issued his ruling on Friday, January 6, 1961, and called for immediate action. Holmes and Hunter registered the following Monday and attended classes two days later. A related ruling by Judge Bootle denied Governor Ernest Vandiver the ability to refuse state funding to the university if it was integrated. Judge Bootle also ordered the desegregation of the Macon bus system in 1962 and Bibb County public schools in 1970. After a distinguished career, Judge Bootle died in early 2005. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and is within the boundaries of the National Register of Historic Places Macon Historic District, which was listed in 1974. Architecture The building in 2018 The building displays many characteristics of the Beaux Arts Classicism style of architecture. Architect James Knox Taylor was responsible for the construction of many classically inspired buildings during his Federal career. Taylor believed that classical architecture espoused the symbolic value of Federal buildings as lasting monuments to the ideals of democracy. The building contains many character-defining features such as the central pavilion with a pediment (triangular gable), monumental paired columns, balustrades, and decorative swags and garlands. The rusticated first story features deep horizontal grooves between the marble blocks. The facade is clad in white marble on the front and side elevations, but cream-colored glazed brick is on the rear portion. The building sits on a raised granite base. Above the rusticated first floor, the marble is laid without recessed joints, resulting in a smooth finish. A dentil course of small blocks extends across the facade and is another classical feature. Fenestration includes rectangular windows topped with marble pediments and arched windows with prominent keystones. Three large windows on the second story are each topped with fanlights. Plaques with swag designs are located above the keystones. The original portion of the building had a U-shaped plan with an open light court that provided illumination to interior spaces. In 1917, a wing was added to the rear of the building. The addition respected the original design and used similar materials, but was less ornamental than the original facade. In 1934, a second addition was completed, providing another courtroom and more office space. Both were constructed under the auspices of the Supervising Architect's office. The lobby is divided into two areas: a postal lobby in the original portion of the building and a public lobby that is part of the 1934 addition. In the postal lobby, verde (green) marble pilasters (attached columns) with scrolled Ionic capitals decorate the walls. The floors are terrazzo with brass dividers and verde marble borders. The same marble is used for the wainscot. Heavily veined white marble veneer covers the upper portions of the walls. The ornate ceiling is executed in plaster and features beams that divide the ceiling into distinct panels. Each panel is outlined with a dentil course and egg-and-dart decorative molding. A decorative band called a guilloche with floral patterns also defines each panel. The centers each have a plaster medallion outlined with an acanthus leaf design. Cylindrical brass light fixtures descend from the centers of the panels. Original octagonal postal tables that sit upon verde marble bases remain in the lobby. Decorative finishes and details in the public lobby are similar to those in the postal lobby and provide continuity to the interior. However, ceiling panels in the public lobby are less ornate. The main staircase ascends from the first floor. Its newel posts and baluster are cast iron with a wood railing, and treads are white marble. Elevators have been replaced, but the exterior finishes are original and include doors with brass panels and verde marble surrounds. The second floor contains the ceremonial courtroom. Oak wainscot covers the walls and an ornamental cornice encompasses the top of the room. Original furnishings in the room include the judge's bench, witness box, clerk's desk, court rail and benches, and jury box. Original lighting fixtures illuminate the powder-blue and white vaulted ceiling.

Tuttle U.S. Court of Appeals Building, also known as U.S. Post Office and Courthouse, is a historic Renaissance Revival style courthouse located in the Fairlie-Poplar district of Downtown Atlanta in Fulton County, Georgia. It is the courthouse for the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Its role as the first courthouse in which many key cases of the Civil Rights Movement were heard had it listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. It was listed as a contributing building in the Fairlie Poplar Historic District in 1984. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2015. Building history In the years following the American Civil War, Atlanta's population expanded rapidly. To meet increased demands for federal services, Congress approved funds for a new building containing both postal and courthouse functions. When ground was broken in 1907, workers discovered a natural rock formation that resembled an American eagle, which observers interpreted to mean that the federal building was destined for the site. James Knox Taylor, supervising architect of the U.S. Treasury Department, designed the building, which was completed in 1910 and deemed by the press to be \\"a great step forward in the scheme of beautifying Atlanta.\\" When the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals was established in 1981, it occupied the building, which was renamed in 1989 to honor Elbert Parr Tuttle (1897‚Äì1996), a renowned judge. Many important cases have been argued in the courthouse. In 2000, the court upheld the American government's decision that Elian Gonzalez, a Cuban boy who was rescued off the Florida coast after his mother died during an attempt to enter the United States, should be returned to the custody of his father, in Cuba. The same year, several lawsuits involving the presidential election were decided. In Bush v. Gore, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the denial of a petition to stop manual recounts of ballots. The controversy eventually was decided by the Supreme Court. Architecture James Knox Taylor designed the Elbert P. Tuttle U.S. Court of Appeals Building in the Second Renaissance Revival style of architecture. The dignified style was commonly used for federal buildings during the early twentieth century. The building occupies the block bounded by Forsyth, Fairlie, Poplar, and Walton streets in downtown Atlanta. It is five stories in height and has a U-shaped footprint with a central courtyard. The building is clad in granite on the street elevations, while the sides that enclose the courtyard are clad in buff-colored brick. The facade faces Forsyth Street. The first story is defined by rusticated granite and round-arched openings. Separating the first and second stories is a stringcourse with medallions and incised vertical designs topped with a wave pattern. Windows on the second level each have a classical balustrade, frieze with carved classical motifs, and molded cornice supported by scrolled brackets. The third and fourth stories are marked by large round-arched windows with scrolled keystones. These windows denote the interior location of the courtrooms. The arched windows are divided by classical pilasters (attached columns) and circular medallions. The top level has small rectangular windows separated by cartouches (decorative ovals). A heavy, ornate cornice with a dentil (rectangular block) course and carved anthemion motifs tops the building. Other elevations contain a similar level of detail, although they lack the two-story arched windows. Windows on other elevations are topped with pediments containing cartouches or lintels with medallions or carved keystones. Some windows contain carved serpent-and-staff designs, which were associated with Mercury, the Roman messenger god who was an early symbol of the postal service in the United States. An iron arch spans a loading dock in the courtyard area on Fairlie Street. Many original interior finishes and public spaces remain. The dominant feature of the first-floor lobby is its vaulted ceiling, which springs from a series of pilasters. At each end of the lobby are domed ceilings. Window and door frames and wainscot are marble, while upper wall surfaces are covered with plaster. Original arched, bronze casement windows remain in place. Beneath each window is an original wall- mounted marble letter table resting on cast-iron brackets. Floors were originally marble, but are now covered with green terrazzo panels trimmed with gray terrazzo. A mural by an unknown artist depicts a classical seated figure of Justice flanked by allegorical representations of Agriculture and Industry. A staircase with marble treads and wainscot and a cast-iron baluster with a swag pattern leads to upper floors. The main courtrooms are the most significant spaces on the third floor. The most impressive is the two-story en banc courtroom that is designed for all of the appellate judges to meet to hear a case. Walls are covered with elaborately carved, stained oak paneling decorated with garlands, scrolled brackets, and molding. Large, round-arch windows are balanced with recessed arched bays on the opposite walls. Bronze grilles are located throughout. The maple floor is laid in a herringbone pattern and an elaborate, plaster, coffered ceiling with rosettes tops the room. Another appellate courtroom, although slightly smaller in scale, is equally impressive. Similar finishes are used on the walls and floor, and a gallery of oak benches provides seating for observers.

Being of Cypriot heritage, he has represented Cyprus youth at international level. Career Club career Stavrinou started his career in the Charlton Athletic Youth Academy from the age of 13, rising through into the Reserves. In the 2008‚Äì09 season, he made 23 appearances for the under-18 team scoring once, and a further 12 appearances in the reserves. He signed his first professional contract for Charlton Athletic in June 2009. Stavrinou made his first-team debut for Charlton in their 1‚Äì0 away against Herford United in the League Cup on 11 August. Charlton manager, Phil Parkinson praised Stavrinou saying; \\"Alex Stavrinou came in for his debut and I thought it was an absolutely terrific performance\\". Stavrinou signed for Conference National club Ebbsfleet United on a one-month loan in November 2009, which was then extended to a season long loan where he won 'young player of the year' . In October 2010, Stavrinou joined Cambridge United on a one- month loan deal. His loan was later extended until 9 January 2011. In May 2011, Stavrinou played for Aldershot Town in a reserve game against Brentford, losing 4‚Äì1. On 12 August 2011, Stavrinou signed for his former loan club Ebbsfleet United following a vote by members of My Football Club, which owned Ebbsfleet United, to increase the playing budget. After finishing the 2013‚Äì14 season as player of the year at Cray Wanderers, he started the following season at Aveley. After a brief spell back with Cray Wanderers at the end of the year, he returned to Aveley in January 2015. International career Although born in England, Stavrinou has represented Cyprus under-17, qualifying through his father's Cypriot heritage. Stravrinou was also approached to feature for Cyprus under-21, but stated at the time that he'd like to concentrate on his career with Charlton Athletic. He said; \\"They've spoken to my parents about possibly featuring for the U21s but as I've only got a year here I really need to be pushing on and focusing all my efforts on Charlton.\\" Style of play As a youth player, Stavrinou played as a centre back, before his under-16 manager Steve Avory converted him into a midfielder. Martin Ling described him as; \\"tenacious but also technical central midfielder who can do both sides of the game\\". Personal life As a young man, he attended St Bonaventure's Catholic School in Forest Gate. After he was done with his job at Charlton Athletic he went to a sports company called Sports4Schools. He is known for teaching PE lessons at Essex Primary School in Manor Park.

Life  Sarkissian attended the School of Fine Arts there in 1977, followed by the Yerevan State Pedagogical University (Drawing) in 1989. He lives and works in Yerevan, Armenia.  Art  Sarkissian works in abstract art as a statement of post- soviet freedom of expression. He said in 2005, \\"my approach to painting developed from the desire to free myself from Socialist Realism.\\" His canvases combine painting and silkscreen printing, incorporating text, photographs, signs, architectural images and extracts from other paintings, fusing oil paint with found ephemera. Such a polyglot, polysemic art is not unique to Sarkissian. We see his style anticipated by Robert Rauschenberg, and before him Kurt Schwitters. We even see its textures and practices, as well as philosophical positions, reflected in the work of such disparate predecessors as Warhol, Cornell, Miro, Malevich, and, of course, Picasso. Among other things, Sarkissian demonstrates that the ‚Äúcollage aesthetic‚Äù ‚Äì the simultaneously disjunctive and conjunctive qualities that uniquely define modern composition ‚Äì remains one of 20th century art‚Äôs most significant and enduring legacies. Indeed, this collage aesthetic provides the perceptual crucible in which the dialectic described above is forged, and it defines the particular visual world in which Sarkissian finds his expression. His installation artwork includes the work Closed Session, comprising a row of seven chairs of varying sizes, each standing on four lit lightbulbs; described by Sonia Balassanian, curator of the Armenian Center for Contemporary Experimental Art (ACCEA), as a \\"satirical reference to self-aggrandizing decision-makers.\\" His work is displayed in the Museum of Modern Art in Yerevan.

Licensed to Hayden, Colorado, the station is currently owned by Patricia MacDonald Garber and Peter Benedetti, through licensee AlwaysMountainTime, LLC. History The station was assigned the call letters KBDU on 20 April 1998. On 10 February 2000, the station changed its call sign to KRMR; on 9 October 2006 it changed to KTRJ, and on 24 December 2007 changed again to the current KQZR. In the 1980s, KQZR was owned by Tri-county Broadcasting Corporation and broadcast Country-Western format from studios in Craig, CO. Tri-county was one-third owned by Doyle Berry, a Louisiana businessman and CEO of Berry Bros General Contractors in Meeker, one-third owned by Mr. Jim Wilson Sr., a bank president from Meeker, and one-third owned by an East coast conglomerate. The transmitter site located on Meeker mountain, was the tallest transmitter site in the Continental US and broadcast at 100,000 watts. The station ceased operating after three years, due mainly to the high cost of transporting electricity up the side of Meeker mountain. The general manager of KQZR at that time was Mike Huning and Program Director Don Nelson. The reliable reception pattern stretched south to Rifle, CO; west to Rangely, CO and Ogden, Utah; north to mid-Wyoming and Casper. The station's motto was interchangeable \\"The Energy Brand of the Radio Frontier\\" and \\"The Radio Brand of the Energy Frontier\\". At its peak, the station employed twenty- two and had an Arbitron ranking of No. 1 against four other radio stations. This No. 1 position in the ratings was due to several factors: on-air personalities; popular choice of artists like Reba McEntire, Oak Ridge Boys, Christopher Cross, Eddie Rabbitt, Patsy Cline, Crystal Gayle, Barbara Mandrell, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Linda Ronstadt; as well as aggressive marketing campaigns. One such marketing campaign with City Market grocery was to place a registration card in each grocery sack that entitled a winning registrant to a cash prize (multiples of $102.50). A common on-air theme was the \\"Z-one oh two Block Party Weekend\\" where a sequence of three songs from the same artist was played back-to-back-to-back with three artists (9 songs) played in a row with no commercials. On January 24, 1982, during the NFL Super Bowl of 1982, some oil company employees using snowmobiles on Meeker mountain broke into the transmitter building and shutdown the transmitter so that they could receive the television signal during the game. (The powerful 100,000 watt transmitter blocked out all other air wave signals on the mountain.) The station staff often furloughed at Sleepy Cat Guest Ranch where libations were had all around. The station studios in Craig featured the first color weather radar on the Western slope with marketing agreements to Denver television stations for a signal feed. The studios were connected to the transmitter site on Meeker mountain through a state-of-the-art microwave two- way twelve-channel telemetry radio-telegraph system. The station's billing system ran off a Hewlett-Packard HP3000 computer system, also the first automated billing system on the Western slope of Colorado for a small broadcast station. Another first for this market was the implementation of automated programming through a quad Revox A77 reel-to-reel automation system. At this time, KQZR broadcast on 102.5 FM (often recalled as \\"Zee-one oh two!\\") 24 hours per day and provided a fully staffed full-time news department with roving reporters, one of which was the well-known political reporter Sarah McClendon. Ms. McClendon provided weekly news reports directly from Capitol Hill fed through a state-of-the-art Vocoder over normal, long-distance phone lines from the fall of 1981 through 1982 covering topics of national importance that impacted people on the Western slope. During one Presidential press conference in October 1981, Ms. McClendon announced she was from KQZR, Craig, CO before asking Margaret Tutwiler about the effect additional gun control laws would have on hunters in Colorado. KQZR broadcast the Dial Global Classic Rock format until November 2012 when it resumed locally programmed KQZR \\"The REEL,\\" also known as \\"Classic Rock for the Yampa Valley,\\" or more commonly, \\"The Yampa Valley's Classic Rock\\". The library includes a wide variety of classics, deeper cuts and new songs from core artist like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Crosby Still Nash & Young, Tom Petty and more. The morning show Mon-Fri is hosted by radio personality Raymond Gabriel also known as \\"Ray Ray on The Reel\\" featuring the Gyro Hero Story of the Day. The afternoon show is hosted by radio personality \\"Calder Young\\" both local favorites.

It is a rural cemetery established in the 1840s on a glacial drumlin. From its original , it has almost tripled in size. Graves are on terraces in the rolling terrain. Tall trees, including some locally rare species, maintain a parklike atmosphere. Its notable monuments include a local Civil War memorial, a chapel and entrance arch. The dead buried there include Rufus Bullock, the first Republican Governor of Georgia and nine congressmen from two other states beside New York. In 1976 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. It was the first property in Orleans County listed on the Register, and is so far the only one in the Town of Albion. Grounds The cemetery is a rectangular parcel on the south side of Route 31 between the Butts and Keitel Road intersections, east of the village of Albion. Its terrain is gently rolling, dominated by a hill in the southeast quadrant. The area is rural, with the cemetery's sandstone office and barn located opposite its main entrance, near another smaller cemetery across the street. Immediately west of the lot is a small business. On all other sides the cemetery is surrounded by open lots and worked fields. The northern three-quarters of the property has tall mature deciduous trees sheltering most of the graves; the southern quarter is open. Among the trees are a rare yucca and one of the few butternuts in the area. Rows of evergreens are located north and south of the hilltop; on the south the land is still wooded and not yet used for burials. A network of paved roads, many named after trees and shrubs, runs through the cemetery. The rises in the terrain are terraced to allow for level gravesites. There are three entrances from Route 31; the central one across from the cemetery offices is the main entrance. It is framed by a carved Medina sandstone arch with a slate roof and iron gates. A short distance south is a small parking lot and sandstone chapel, a Gothic building with steep gabled roof shingled in slate. Atop the hill in the southeast quadrant is the cylindrical Soldiers and Sailors Monument, also of red (\\"Medina\\") sandstone. A pointed-arched door on the north side opens to a spiral staircase climbing to the overlook at the top, which offers 360-degree views of the surrounding countryside. In the northwest corner of the cemetery is a small square pond fed by a natural spring. It is trimmed with blocks which are made out of cement by the local cement company that was in Albion to look like sandstone, red (\\"Medina\\") sandstone and granite. On its south side is a domed cement block (made to look like sandstone) spring house with \\"1908\\" carved into it made out of the same cement blocks as the pond. History Mt. Albion was established 12 years after Mt. Auburn Cemetery in Massachusetts popularized the rural cemetery, where graves were located in a park-like setting outside an urban area. Arad Thomas and Lorenzo Burrows were tasked with revising the village charter so that land outside of the village limits could be purchased for use a municipal cemetery. Instead of adding amendments to the charter, the committee redrafted the entire document, which was passed by the New York State Legislature on April 1, 1842. Soon after, the citizens of Albion selected Lorenzo Burrows and Alexis Ward to locate a parcel of land on which a new municipal cemetery could be established. A suitable location sitting on 25 acres of forested hills and rolling meadows atop a sandy drumlin were selected and purchased for $40 per acre from Jacob Annis and Lyman O. Patterson. A former engineer on the Erie Canal, Marvin Porter, was hired to design the landscape in the eastern, oldest portion of the cemetery. To cover the initial cost of the land, lots were sold at auction where wealthy citizens purchased graves on prominent locations overlooking the main entrance to the cemetery; Lorenzo Burrows purchased lot number one. The cemetery was dedicated on September 7, 1843 in the presence of thousands of local residents who listened to a public address by Daniel Cady, Esq. Oversight of the cemetery fell under the responsibility of the village president and board of trustees while lot owners were tasked with caring for and improving their graves. In 1862, after nearly two decades of poor upkeep and minimal improvements, the village board of trustees appointed three commissioners to oversee the cemetery; Lorenzo Burrows, Lemuel C. Paine, and Henry J. Sickels. Upon their appointment, the commissioners hired the cemetery's first caretaker, Michael Hanley, who was responsible for maintaining the cemetery grounds. In 1874 and additional 13.5 acres were added to the west of the original cemetery boundary and a rudimentary receiving vault was added. The following year, the Gothic Revival cemetery chapel was constructed of locally quarried Medina Sandstone at a cost of $3,000 by A. Harris and R. Romp. The structure's design was completed by Charles Diem, a local marble dealer operating with Norman S. Field in Albion. Atop the cemetery's highest point, the Soldiers & Sailors Monument was erected between 1874 and 1876 to the memory of local soldiers who died during the Civil War. On June 1, 1883, a committee led by David Hardie met to select a fifty square foot lot for the interment of Civil War veterans. Four years later, Hiram Curtis Post GAR appointed a committee to secure the removal of veterans from the potter's field within Mt. Albion Cemetery to the veterans lot. The local GAR posts assisted in relocated ten other bodies to the lot by November 9, 1887 while securing new headstones for each veteran. On May 28, 1885, a flag pole and cannon were dedicated on the site. The M1841 six pounder bronze howitzer was cast by the Ames Foundry at Springfield, Massachusetts and inspected by Capt. William Maynadier, ordinance inspector at the Maryland arsenal. alt=A slightly pinkish black and white photograph of a pointed stone entry arch with iron fencing on either side and a cemetery with grave monuments beyond By 1894 the cemetery had reached its present size. As it expanded, the park-like atmosphere was maintained. The rises were terraced with the dells between them kept flat. Trees and shrubs similar to those in the eastern half were planted, some in an orchard. Further park amenities, such as the 1908 pond and the Ingersoll Memorial Fountain in front of the chapel in 1914, were added.

However, Thomas Higgins, the nationalist candidate in North Galway had died the night before polling day and was elected posthumously, thereby creating an immediate vacancy.

H. Flower and B. Kummel. 1950. A Classification of the Nautiloidea. Journal of Paleontology 24(5):604-616 that is no longer in common use. Taxonomy The Order Basslerocerida was established by Flower and Kummel (1950) for forms intermediary between the ancestral Ellesmerocerida and the more advanced Tarphycerida and Oncocerida. The order, as originally defined, contains two families, the Bassleroceratidae with thick-walled siphuncles which gave rise to the Tarphycerida, and the Graciloceratidae, derived from the former, with thin-walled siphuncles which gave rise to the Onocerida. The speculation in Flower and Kummel (1950) that the Basslerocerida, through the Graciloceratidae, might have given rise to the Barrandeocerida may account for the inclusion of the Barradeocerina in the Basslerocerida in some classifications and the extension of the order to the Devonian. The derivation of barrandeoceroids from within the Tarphycerida is however well established. Basslerocerida has fallen into general disuse, the taxa now being included in either the Ellesmerocerida or in the derived Tarphycerida and Oncocerida, although Sheverev (2006) A. A. Shevyrev. 2006.

(Ed); The Ordovician System: Proceedings of a Paleontological Association Symposium; Birmingham, Eng. 1974; Univ of Wales and Welsh Nat‚Äôl Mus Press instead included the Bassleroceritidae in the Tarphycerida. Morphology Nothing is known about the basslerocerid soft part anatomy, although they may be surmised to have had somewhat squid-like bodies with perhaps 8 or 10 arms. Shells are rather small, reaching lengths of about 12 ‚Äì15 cm (5 ‚Äì6 in); elongate with an upward, exogastric, curvature -like a rocker -and subcircular to laterally compressed cross section. The venter on the outer curvature is commonly more sharply rounded, giving it a keel-like form, than the dorsum on the inner curvature. Septa are close spaced, the siphuncle ventral. The siphuncle in the Bassleroceratidae is composed of thick connecting rings as found in the ancestral Ellesmerocerida and in primitive Tarphycerida. Connecting rings in the derived Graciloceratidae are thin, as found in the Oncocerida.

The company was in existence from 1936 to 1968 and was based in H√∏nefoss, Norway. Among the company's products is Oslo Tramway's SM53 trams, the Trondheim Tramway's GB Class 3 tram and the Norwegian State Railways Skd 221 shunters. History The company was founded as H√∏nefoss Karosserifabrikk in 1936 by Major Roald Breien, who wanted to start a mechanical workshop to create jobs in the local area. At first the company had six employees and was based in Arnemannsveien in the city center (now the seat of the city's culture center). To begin with, the company manufactured bus bodywork for domestic coach and bus companies. In addition, the company built tank trucks, fire engines and delivery vans. H√∏ka had the Norwegian rights to a Czech patent for closed, wood-filled steel profiles. In Sweden, this patent was held by H√§gglund & S√∂ner, thus starting the cooperation between the two companies. By 1940, H√∏ka had 50 employees. During World War II from 1940 to 1945, the demand for new buses halted, but H√∏ka entered the maintenance and repair industry. Aerial view of the factory After the war, during which the company had made good money, the company built a new plant at H√∏nengaten outside the town in 1948. This plant was located to the Roa‚ÄìH√∏nefoss Line of the Norwegian State Railways (NSB), and a branch line was constructed from the mainline railway to the plant. The new location, the cooperation with H√§gglunds and NSBs need for large amounts of rolling stock during the 1950s, made it possible for H√∏ka to enter the rolling stock market. At the same time, the company changed its name to H√∏nefoss Jernbanevogn- og Karosserifabrikk (meaning H√∏nefoss Railway Car and Bodyworks Factory). The same year also saw Breien retire, and be replaced by Jakob M√∏rk, who formerly had worked for Ekebergbanen, that operated one of the suburban tramways in Oslo. That year the company had 90 employees. The company continued to manufacture buses after the war, and built bodywork in both wood, steel and aluminum. Production of buses peaked with 24 delivered vehicles in 1949, but from 1954 the company did not build any buses, except for a series of 33 vehicles to Oslo Sporveier in 1961. These were the last buses built by H√∏ka. During the 1950s, both NSB, private railways and the tram operators in the country were in need of rolling stock. The main manufacturers were Str√∏mmens V√¶rksted and Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk, with Eidsfoss V√¶rk also building freight cars. The large quantity of the time, in addition to the strategic need for multiple manufacturers saw the rail companies spreading deliveries between the four manufacturers, and insisting on licence production of each other's models for large deliveries. Construction of an SM53 tram in 1952 From 1952, the company also delivered trams. The first was a series of 30, later supplemented by 20 more trams and 12 trailers, were delivered until 1958. In 1956, the company lost a contract to build a new series of trams for the Trondheim Tramway after the Dalsenget fire that wiped out most of the tram fleet of Trondheim Sporvei, but the company managed to secure a single order from Graakalbanen for a tram and trailer on the Gr√•kallen Line in Trondheim. By 1957, the peak employment was reached, at 140 people. In 1957, the company delivered 20 gondolas to Narvik and in 1959, 400 trailers were delivered to the Norwegian Army. In 1956, the company also started manufacturing a two-axle battery-powered locomotive. These had gauge and electric equipment from Siemens. Thirteen units were sold to various industrial facilities between 1956 and 1962. From 1960, H√∏ka also started manufacturing a standard gauge shunting locomotive. The first was sold to Norsk Jernverk, and the following year six were leased to NSB, who gave them designation Skd 221. In 1964, NSB bought an additional four units. The final unit was built for internal use at H√∏ka. The goal of the Skd 221-delivery was to get the large contract that NSB would issue in the mid-1960s for their shunters, but this was instead given to Levahn Mekaniske Verksted of Oslo. During the mid 1960s, there was a large decline in the demand for trains from NSB. At the same time, it was decided that both the tramways in Oslo and Bergen would be closed, and no new rolling stock would be needed. The authorities and NSB both realised that there was no need for more than one domestic manufacturer of rolling stock, and all new orders were placed with Str√∏mmen. Due to lack of capacity at Str√∏mmen, H√∏ka received several suborders. In March 1967, Str√∏mmen bought H√∏ka, and decided to close the plant in December 1968. Vehicles Buses In 1938, the company delivered two trolleybuses to the Drammen trolleybus, operated by Drammen Kommunale Trikk. These electrical equipment for these were delivered by Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies of the United Kingdom. One of these buses has been preserved. Another type of bus was a semitrailer system that could carry 60 passengers, and was delivered to Engeseth Busslinjer in 1938, who used it until 1953 on their route from H√∏nefoss to Oslo. Freight cars The first rail contract was for eight boxcars that would be hauled by NSB Class 87 multiple units, with delivery in 1950. This was followed by various orders to the state railways, and included boxcars, reefers and steel bridges. Other customers included Norsk Jernverk and Norsk Transport (who operated the Rjukan Line). The largest freight order was for 180 boxcars type Gr5, delivered from 1963 to 1965. At the most, H√∏ke delivered one freight car each 18 hours. In 1957, H√∏ke delivered a gauge timber car for the Swedish Nordmark‚ÄìKlar√§lven Railway. In 1968, H√∏ka delivered two skip cars to Sydvaranger. Oslo Tramway SM53 SM53 tram of the Oslo Tramway The SM53 were a tram model which operated for more than 40 years on the Oslo Tramway. A number of these trams were later rebuilt and became known as SM83 trams. The trams were based on the Swedish Mustang trams, and were delivered with Swedish electronics. H√∏ka gained a reputation and legacy as very reliable and successful. Between 1982 and 1983, the trams were converted to one man operation. The SM53 trams were retired between 1990 and 1997. The first batch of 30 H√∏ka trams were built between 1952 and 1953, numbered 204-233. These were originally designated MBO 50. The second batch of 12 trams was built in 1957, designated MBO 55, and numbered 234-245. The final batch, numbered 246-253 was built in 1958, and designated MBO 56. The designations were later revised to SM53/I, SM53/II, and SM53/III respectively. The trams were 14.7 metres long, 2.5 metres wide, and had a weight of 16.9 tons. Tram number 234 is preserved by the Oslo Tramway Museum. Graakalbanen Class 3 GB Class 3 tram of the Trondheim Tramway Class 3 was a single tram and trailer built for Graakalbanen of Trondheim. Each of the four Siemens motors had an effect of . The trams were criticized for not having sufficient space for baby buggies. Despite running in part in city streets, the trams were wide. They had seating for 40, later 36, passengers. The tram was delivered in 1955. It remained in service until 1973, when it was replaced by the TS Class 7 trams, following the merger of Graakalbanen into Trondheim Trafikkselskap. It is preserved as a heritage tram at Trondheim Tramway Museum.

The site of approximately 54 acres is located in the lowlands of the Yucat√°n Peninsula, between the regions of Rio Bec and Chenes. There are some significant differences that have yet to be explained completely, which distinguish it from some of the other nearby sites. Discovery A team of Mexican and foreign experts from the Research Center of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (ZRC SAZU) and Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico (UNAM), headed by archaeologist Ivan Sprajc, rediscovered the site in 2013 http://www.latinospost.com/articles/21973/20130621/lost-mayan-city-discovered- deep-mexican-jungle-previously-known-lumberers.htm by aerial photographshttp://www.dailygrail.com/Sacred-Sites/2013/6/Ancient-Maya-City- Discovered-Mexico and named it Chact√∫n, \\"Red Stone\\".

Evidence of logging suggests locals were aware of the site. This is because of the difficulty in accessing the area due to difficult terrain and overgrown vegetation. To reach the area, the team of archaeologists spent four weeks reopening an abandoned and heavily overgrown dirt-road. Without the discovery with aerial photography, it is likely this site would have remained hidden for much longer. The project surveyed the three urban cores of the site to create maps and three dimensional models. Ancient use Chact√∫n is believed to have been an ancient city that served as a government seat for a large area. The researchers dated the site to 600 to 900 AD.http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/agencia-efe/130619/vast-mayan-city- discovered-southeast-mexico-jungle The site contains three complexes of monumental architecture. The West Complex is the largest one, making up about half of the total area of the site. There are many pyramids throughout the site, with the tallest one reaching a height of 23 meters, as well as two ball courts, a number of large palace-like buildings surrounding several plazas, and various residential areas. There are also many sculpted stone stelae and altars.https://articles.latimes.com/2013/jun/21/science/la-sci-sn-maya-ruins- city-chactun-mexico-discovered-yucatan-20130621 While some of them are plain and others eroded, a few monuments have well preserved reliefs, including hieroglyphic inscriptions.

One wall partially surrounds the granite monument, while a second wall, constructed a year after the first, wraps around the reverse of the memorial's elevated platform. The site also features seven flagpoles, one flying the flag of the United States and the POW/MIA flag, and six others displaying the flags of the U.S. Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and Merchant Marine. The memorial is surrounded by several trees and numerous park benches. Each tree and park bench bears a bronze plaque inscribed with the names of veterans, community organizations, or local businesses on whose behalf financial contributions were made to fund the memorial's construction. Adjacent to the memorial is a Korean War-era Grumman F9F-6P Cougar Naval airframe, on loan to the Town of Tonawanda from the U.S. government.Becker, Maki. (May 30, 2009). \\"Keep off Navy plane, Tonawanda children told\\". The Buffalo News. The airframe was installed at its current location in May 1959 and is a well-known landmark in the community.  History  Background The Town of Tonawanda Veterans Memorial project began in 2004 as a grassroots effort to establish a permanent site in the town for residents to gather and pay tribute to their relatives, friends, and fellow Americans who have served or currently serve in the U.S. Military.Pye, Daniel. (August 14, 2009). \\"Colin Powell to speak at dedication\\". Tonawanda News. In 2007, the Town of Tonawanda Veterans Memorial Steering Committee was established to see the project through to completion. Groundbreaking ceremony held May 22, 2009. To fund construction, the memorial steering committee solicited private donations from town residents and business owners. For $100, a donor could have the name of a military veteran of their choice engraved on the memorial. Donors could also have a tree, park bench, or flag pole dedicated in honor of a veteran for $1,000, $2,000, or $3,000, respectively. Between 2007 and 2009, the committee raised over $100,000 in private donations and successfully applied for $47,500 in grant funding offered by the State of New York. By the spring of 2009, the committee had reached its funding goal to cover the cost of construction and the project was ready to be put out to bid. The Tonawanda Town Board agreed to designate space for the memorial at Walter M. Kenney Field and fully manage its construction.Pye, Daniel. (April 8, 2009). \\"Rec department offices to cost less than $1 million\\". The project was put out to bid three times before an offer was returned within the range that the committee could afford. With a construction contractor confirmed and work set to begin, the memorial steering committee held a groundbreaking ceremony on May 22, 2009 at what was to be the future site of the memorial. Joining the steering committee that day were local military veterans and residents, as well as town and state officials.Postles, Don. (May 22, 2009). \\"Veterans memorial construction begins\\". WIVB-TV. The \\"Blue Jet\\" Walter M. Kenney Field was the chosen location for the Town of Tonawanda Veterans Memorial for its high visibility from nearby roads, ease of access for pedestrians, and for its historical significance as the longtime home of a Korean War-era Grumman F9F-6P Cougar Naval airframe, on loan to the town from the U.S. government. The \\"blue jet,\\" as it is often called, has been on loan to the town from the U.S. government since May 1959. Today, the memorial sits directly behind the F9F-6P airframe. During the construction of the memorial, a local auto collision business volunteered to refurbish the F9F-6P airframe.Adamczyk, Ed. (August 14, 2009). \\"Honoring those who served, and everyone else\\" . Tonawanda News. To refurbish the aluminum structure, volunteers removed all old paint, pounded out dents, filled in cracks and gaps, repainted all surfaces, and applied decals to the fuselage and wings. The entire process took roughly three weeks to complete. Since its installation, the F9F-6P airframe had been used as a piece of playground equipment by local children. However, in February 2009, town government officials received paperwork from the National Museum of Naval Aviation requesting that the town take full responsibility for the loaned airframe's upkeep and make an effort to prevent people from climbing on its wings and fuselage. In response to this request, the town initially installed signage asking visitors to refrain from climbing on the airframe. However, the damage continued. Less than a year later, volunteers once again took to repairing the airframe, after which the town installed a four-foot high wrought-iron fence around the long-standing community icon. On July 11, 2014, a former resident of the area offered to commit an unspecified sum for the plane's upkeep if the town would remove the fence. The town responded that it is not permitted by the National Museum of Naval Aviation to permit people to climb on the plane. Further, it stated that because the plane was not maintained for a very long time, the last renovation required the use of carbon fiber, which is not resilient for climbing. Dedication Ceremony The Town of Tonawanda Veterans Memorial was unveiled to the public in a dedication ceremony the afternoon of Tuesday, August 18, 2009. The Tuesday date was chosen to accommodate the event's keynote speaker, Colin Powell, who was scheduled to visit the area for a separate event in nearby Buffalo, New York later that same day.Pye, Daniel.

Invitations had been sent to those that made financial contributions to fund the memorial, but the event was open to the public and received significant media attention in anticipation of Powell's address. Colin Powell speaks at the Town of Tonawanda Veterans Memorial dedication ceremony, August 18, 2009.The ceremony featured multiple military, veteran, and police honor guards, a flag raising ceremony, several speeches, and the unveiling of the memorial's V-shaped granite monument. In addition, a member of the memorial steering committee read a letter from U.S. President Barack Obama written to the people of the Town of Tonawanda in recognition of the day's dedication ceremony. In his keynote address, Powell spoke of the Town of Tonawanda Veterans Memorial as a symbolic gesture of thanks to the military veterans it represents, and as a tool to educate youth on the meaning of military service. He stressed the role of young people in society and acknowledged that it was a teenage Town of Tonawanda resident that initiated the grassroots effort to build the memorial, saying that \\"sometimes it is the youngest people in our community who understand what's important.\\" Powell further remarked that the memorial's location, in a public park and adjacent to a playground, means that it will be readily visible to local children and that \\"it will speak to them silently, but powerfully.\\" He also discussed his appreciation of military service throughout the history of the U.S. and of his own military service, including his time leading the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Powell ended his speech on the topic of government policies aimed at providing services to military veterans, including health care and other benefits. On this, Powell said that offering those services to military veterans is as much a symbol of thanks as a memorial built in their honor. Memorial Expansion At the time of its dedication, the memorial listed the names of nearly 500 local military veterans categorized according to their branch of service across 12 granite plaques mounted to the memorial wall.The Buffalo News. (August 15, 2009). \\"Powell to address dedication of memorial\\". The wall itself was designed to accommodate a total of 1,000 names, with the expectation that names beyond the first 500 would be added to the wall over a period of years following construction. However, it was just months after the dedication ceremony that the wall reached capacity. By the end of 2009, more names had been submitted for engraving than could be accommodated on the original wall.Pye, Daniel. (March 23, 2010). \\"Vets' memorial expansion planned\\". Tonawanda News. In light of this, the Town of Tonawanda chose to initiate a second phase of construction to expand the memorial. That expansion took the form of a semicircular wall surrounding the back side of the existing memorial, adding space for up to 2,500 additional names across 30 new granite plaques. Construction began in the spring of 2010 with workers carefully orchestrating the installation of the new wall around existing memorial fixtures. Work on the second wall finished in time for the town to host a re- dedication ceremony one year after the first, on August 18, 2010.

The A.E.3, which was a development of the Royal Aircraft Factory's N.E.1 night fighter, was a two-seat single-engined pusher biplane. Three were built in 1918, but the type was unsuccessful, with no further production ensuing. Development and design In late 1917, the Royal Aircraft Factory started development of a two-seat, heavily armoured contact patrol aircraft for the Royal Flying Corps, designed to carry out observation in contact with the infantry, a job that required flying at low altitudes over the front line, exposing the aircraft to heavy small-arms fire from the enemy's trenches.Bruce 1979, p. 149. Three prototypes of the resulting design, designated A.E.3, were ordered.Bruce 1979, p. 150. It was a single-engined pusher biplane, based on the N.E.1 night fighter. It retained much of the structure of the N.E.1, including the outer wings, undercarriage, tailplane and tail booms, but had a new armoured nacelle constructed completely of armour plate. Two Lewis guns were fitted on an armoured mounting in the front of the nacelle that allowed the guns to be depressed to attack targets below, while another Lewis gun was mounted on a pillar mounting between the gunner and pilot to defend the aircraft from attack.Bruce 1968, p. 12. The A.E.1 was originally intended to be powered by the same Hispano-Suiza engine that had powered the N.E.1, but there were severe shortages of this engine, with over 400 S.E.5A fighters waiting incomplete due to lack of engines in January 1918, and it was decided to use alternative engines, with the Sunbeam Arab being chosen for the first prototype, and the Bentley BR.2 rotary engine (which would have been used if the aircraft was chosen for production) for the second. The first A.E.1 flew during April 1918,Mason 1992, p. 136. with the second prototype following on 1 June 1918, while the third prototype, which was powered by an Arab engine, and fitted with face-hardened armour, was finished later that month. By this time the Royal Aircraft Factory had been renamed the Royal Aircraft Establishment, and the A.E.1 was given the name Farnborough Ram, the only Royal Aircraft Factory designed aircraft to be given an official name, with the Arab powered aircraft being named Ram I and the Bentley powered aircraft Ram II. The Ram II was sent to France at the end of June, for trials in its suitability for operational use. These were not successful, with the Ram being considered slow, heavy on the controls and unsuitable for manoeuvering near the ground. Following these trials, Major General John Salmond, the commander of the RAF in the field, stated in a letter to the Air Ministry that \\"I do not consider this machine as useful for any military purpose ... I would recommend that all further work on this machine should cease.\\" No further development followed this condemnation. Specifications (Ram I) See also References *Bruce, J. M.

It is a small stone building dating to the early 19th century. It is one of the few remaining stone houses from that period of the town's history. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Building The house is situated on a lot on the west side of Route 32, with a very short setback from the busy highway. Two large Norway spruce trees screen the front from the road. The surrounding area is mostly either open space or commercial, with some remaining residential property mixed in. To the west there are views of Schunemunk Mountain, Orange County's highest peak. It is a one-and-a-half-story, three-bay structure, rectangular with a one-story frame addition on the west (rear) facade. The main block is sided in fieldstone. On all but the east (front) side it is not laid in any approximation of a pattern. On the east, there are large blocks approximating quoins on the corners and the stones are laid in an approximation of courses. It is topped by a flush gable roof, shingled in cedar shake with simple cornice pierced by two pent-roofed dormer windows and a single stone chimney. The entrance is located in the northernmost of the three front bays. It has a small gabled portico also covered in shake. On the west, two identical dormers pierce the roof. The addition is sided in shake as well. Behind a metal storm door is a wood paneled door. It leads to a side hall that opens on to living and dining rooms. They retain many original finishes, including wideboard flooring, hand-hewn ceiling beams, two fireplaces with Federal style mantels and marble surrounds, and both sawn and hand-hewn floor joists. In the cellar, an opening for the original Dutch oven is still visible. The rear wing houses a modern kitchen. To the north is a clapboard-sided garage with a wood-shingled gabled roof. It is modern and not considered a contributing resource to the property's historic character. History The first mention of the house is an 1856 sale from Benjamin Woodruff to Patrick McGonigal. The house was built in 1790, according to Orange County, NY, tax records. At the time the highway that would become Route 32 was already present. It is one of the few small houses, and one of the only stone houses, remaining in Cornwall from the late 18th century. The rear wing was added in the 20th century; otherwise no significant changes have been made. McGonigal left it to his widow, Roseanne, at his death in 1868 and it has remained a private residence since.

The Cherry Boys formed in 1980. They are most notable for the single \\"Kardomah Cafe\\", which missed the UK Singles Chart, but was a top 10 hit in Spain. Career The band consisted of John Byrne (aka John Cherry) on vocals and guitar, James Hughes on vocals and keyboards, Keith Gunson on vocals and bass, and Howie Minns on drums. Icicle Works drummer Chris Sharrock was part of the band early on, and appeared on their first single \\"Man to Man.\\" The Cherry Boys achieved a significant local following. They won the BBC Radio Merseyside award for Best Local Band in 1982. In the same year they also won best band (and individual musician awards) in the local popular magazine, The End. The band signed with Satril and released four singles and an E.P entitled \\"Give It Rice\\". Despite missing the top 50 in the UK,\\"Kardomah Cafe\\" proved popular in Spain, peaking at number 6 in the Spanish charts in 1984. More recently the song was featured on the compilation album Liverpool Cult Classics Unearthed - Volume Two, released by the Viper Label in 2001. It also appeared on the five disc set Scared to Get Happy: A Story of Indie-Pop 1980-1989 (2013). Following the band's split in 1984, Hughes and Minns went on to form Exhibit B (which released the \\"It‚Äôs Hypothetical\\" single, and album Playing Dead, which was re- released in Japan in 2007). Hughes is now the main writer/musician in the James Clarke Five, whose album, Fly My Pretties Fly!, was released in 2008. John Byrne, the band's chief songwriter, joined The La's and played lead guitar on their international hit \\"There She Goes\\". Byrne is now an acclaimed classical guitarist. Chris Sharrock (the original Cherry Boys drummer) also joined The La's at the same time. Sharrock had previously played with The Icicle Works and subsequently, Lightning Seeds, The Robbie Williams Band and Oasis. The Cherry Boys' manager, Graham Jones, became an author with his first book Last Shop Standing, which was published in 2009. The book deals with the demise of the independent record store, and features a chapter dedicated to his experiences managing both The Cherry Boys and Exhibit B.

It is one of two historic districts in the village, comprising the commercial core of the village, developed during its years as a major stop on the Erie Canal. A portion of the canal, now the New York State Barge Canal, and two of its bridges are within the district. Its buildings represent a diverse collection of architectural styles over a century of development. All but one are considered contributing properties to its historic character. They include an opera house and the village hall. It is one of the most intact commercial areas along the former canal. Many use locally quarried Medina sandstone or brick, a legacy of three destructive fires in the mid and late 19th century which destroyed earlier wood frame buildings. In 1994, the area was recognized as a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Geography The district is an irregularly shaped area centered around the intersection of North Main (state highway NY 98) and East and West Bank streets. It slopes down gently toward the canal along its northern boundary. At its south end it borders on the Orleans County Courthouse Historic District, the other one in Albion. Its boundary follows lot lines and streets, including all the properties on the east of North Main north of Swan Library to the canal and bridge. At the northwest corner it includes the former Sears Carriage Factory at 125 Liberty Street, and a block of Beaver Alley. It then includes the bridge and a portion of the canal, including a concrete prism and the former tow path, eastward to the Ingersoll Street bridge, after which it follows the south bank of the canal back west to the rear line of the Burrows Block at 131¬Ω North Main, the only remnant of a whole row of buildings which fronted on the canal. Then it goes south and east around the village-owned parking lot to include all the buildings on the north side of East Bank Street to the village hall at the Platt Street corner. It excludes the parking lot across the street but then follows its property line south to zigzag across the block and include all the properties down to 35 North Main. The area within the boundary includes 43 buildings and three structures. Only one building, the modern commercial building at 18 North Main, is non-contributing. The rest are generally three- story brick or stone commercial buildings, with a few industrial buildings and houses, in a variety of 19th century styles. The area alternates dense development with open spaces for parking lots. History The development of the district can be divided into three periods: the early years from which only a few buildings remain, the middle years in which many of the current buildings were constructed after fires, and the later years in which the focus has been on preservation. 1810s‚Äì1861: The early years Settlement of the future Albion area began in the early 1810s, picking up later in the decade when construction began on the Erie Canal. In 1822 large-scale development began when Nehemiah Ingersoll bought a large tract of land south of the canal on the east side of what later became Main Street. It was quickly subdivided, with a tavern and store built on Main Street, housing built along the canal route, and a dam and mill built on Sandy Creek, the nearby feeder stream. In 1824 the canal section from Brockport to Lockport, including Albion, was completed and opened. Orleans County was created from the northern half of Genesee County, and the canal helped Albion get chosen over nearby Gaines as the county seat. When the canal was finished the next year, Albion became a bustling port, shipping mainly the wheat and apples grown in the surrounding farms. The brick Greek Revival Burrows Block at 131¬Ω North Main, built in 1827, is the only one remaining from the canal frontage. At the opposite end of the district, the presence of county government influenced development. As in the courthouse historic district, many of the surviving buildings from this period are residences. The oldest building in the district is the 1826 Federal style Porter Lee House at 30 North Main. Around 1830 the two oldest commercial properties, 105‚Äì107 North Main and the Goodrich-Proctor Block at 126 North Main, both brick Greek Revival structures, were built. Other residences and commercial buildings existed; most were wood frame and did not survive later fires. In the late 1830s, a quarry operator near Medina, the next large settlement to the west along the canal, discovered an attractive reddish-brown sedimentary rock and began selling it as a building material. Medina sandstone, as it was called, would eventually be most heavily quarried around Albion, and shipped elsewhere in the state via the canal to be used later in the construction of the state capitol in Albany and many so-called brownstones in New York City. It saw its first use in the future district around 1840, when it was used to build the Sears Carriage Factory at 125 Liberty Street, one of the few surviving industrial buildings near the canal. By the middle of the century, the trade in sandstone and farm products was making Albion prosperous. The canal was joined as a regional transportation artery by the Rochester, Lockport and Niagara Falls Railroad, locally known as the \\"Falls Road\\", soon absorbed into the New York Central, to the south. Two local businessmen, Lorenzo Burrows and Williams Swan, built large, ornate, Greek Revival houses for themselves at 34 and 48 North Main respectively. The current courthouse was built in 1858, providing another focal point to the village and a pole for development. 1862‚Äì1897: Rebuilding Few buildings survive from this era. In 1862 the first of three fires in the district destroyed most of the south side of East Bank between Main and Platt. The Bordwell and Harrington blocks, 16‚Äì28 East Bank, replaced them along with the now-demolished Orleans Hotel. These new buildings were Italianate structures built of brick, the better to survive future fires. Four years later, in 1866, the block of North Main just south of West Bank burned. It was replaced by the Blott, Royce and Empire blocks. At the north end of the rebuilt area was the Granite Block, partially constructed of Medina sandstone. Its design influenced that of neighboring buildings on West Bank built shortly afterwards, in the same style. Seven years later, in 1873, the village built a combination fire station and village hall at 35‚Äì37 East Bank, in the eastern corner of the future district. Its decorative facade combined brick and Medina sandstone. The last fire, in 1882, burned the block of North Main between West Bank and Beaver Alley. The new buildings ‚Äî the Granite and Day & Day blocks and the Pratt Opera House ‚Äî were some of the district's most distinctive. They employed brick and Medina sandstone in various combinations of late Victorian styles: Italianate, Eastlake and Romanesque Revival. Atop the Day & Day and opera house pedimented parapets broke up the continuous flat skyline of that side of Main Street. The Daly and Hanley buildings, built at the north end of the block in 1897, continued this trend. Albion's prosperity continued into the 20th century. Few new buildings were built as the existing buildings remained in good shape. The Independent Order of Odd Fellows hall at 10 North Main, the district's south end, was put up in 1907. The Renaissance Revival bank building at 121 North Main was built in 1895 and further renovated in the 1920s. The last major building was the Strick Building at 31 East Bank, a sandstone commercial structure erected in 1923. 1898‚Äì1994: Buildout and decline During this period the economy began to decline slightly. Improvements in railroad technology had made them more efficient than the canals, so the state responded by combining the Erie and several other canals into the New York State Barge Canal system. The canal was rerouted entirely in some areas, but in Albion it was merely widened and dredged. The two lift bridges in the district were built during this period, which ended around 1930. The improvements to the canal sufficed for only a few more years. Demand for Medina sandstone had been declining in the face of competition from Portland cement, and it was desired only for curbstones. In the late 1940s, that ceased as most easily accessible beds of the material had been exhausted. Albion also suffered when the New York State Thruway was opened to the south, near Batavia, displacing both canal and rail as a freight route. Businesses closed down, but the buildings they were in were not demolished. The listing of the courthouse historic district to the south gave impetus to efforts to preserve and restore the commercial area as well. The district was determined eligible for the National Register in 1986; that was changed when the north side of East Bank between Platt and Ingersoll, originally intended to be included, was found to have too many alterations and modern intrusions to retain its historic integrity. The village created a Historic Preservation Commission (HPC) to oversee its historic districts. It is charged with protecting and enhancing the landmarks within them and making the village more attractive to visitors in order to ensure growth and development. 1995‚Äìpresent: Preservation battles Citizens formed the Albion Main Street Alliance (AMSA) to work to revitalize Albion's downtown, in particular the district. They advocated for a fouRr-point approach used in similar communities across the country: organization, promotion, design and economic restructuring. Specific projects undertaken include beautification such as placing American flags on the street and litter cleanup in Canal Park, taking photographic inventory and mapping the buildings within the district, and organizing community events and education programs related to it. It has been accredited by the National Trust for Historic Preservation,Albion Main Street Alliance, , retrieved December 22, 2010. which gave the village a three-year grant to restore facades in 2008. The HPC clashed with the village's mayor, Mike Hadick, over its denial that year of a sign permit. Commission members felt that a sign Verizon wanted to use on its Main Street store was inappropriate for an area with buildings over a century old, and that it probably had less intrusive signs available to it. Hadick felt that the commission, which he felt had also been insufficiently supportive when the village tried to restore the rear wall of its visitors' center at 121 Main Street, was creating unnecessary obstacles for businesses in a difficult economy. He later granted the permit himself, which the HPC said was beyond his authority. Late in the year he asked four of the seven members to step down since they had not taken their oaths of office within the required 30 days, leaving the commission without a quorum and unable to take action. He said he would take applications from the community for new members instead of reappointing the four, who said they had never been told of the need to take the oath. At a village board meeting early in 2009, Hadick responded to a presentation about the benefits of the historic district by saying he would prefer the demolition of most of the historic properties along Main Street in favor of new ones, claiming that the \\"outdated\\" buildings drove young adults from the village. Members of AMSA and the HPC were critical of his attitude and actions. In the spring, AMSA organized the Olde Orleans Erie Canal Festival to promote the district as part of a corridor of historic and scenic attractions along Route 98, ranging from the nearby courthouse to the Cobblestone National Historic Landmark District and Oak Orchard Lighthouse Museum north of town along the highway. The event included historic re- enactments and building tours. Local artists and organizations exhibited in the Pratt Building, as well. A month later, Hadick resigned as mayor and Dean Theodorakos, one of the HPC members and a village trustee, was chosen by the board to replace him. Theodorakos moved later that year to have the village apply for Certified Local Government (CLG) status from the National Park Service in order to better protect the historic district. Julian Adams, coordinator of the CLG program for the State Historic Preservation Office, said Albion was an ideal community for the program. \\"I was blown away by your downtown,\\" he told a meeting of village officials and interested citizens. \\"You have wonderful buildings here that no one else has\\", due to the lack of any urban renewal efforts in the village.\\">\\"> In 2010, the commission had to start its work over again when it discovered that the historic district had never been formally established under local law. Almost ten years earlier, public hearings required by law had been held, but the resulting documentation was never filed with the county clerk's office and could not be located in village archives. That gave the commission an opportunity to consider expanding the district recognized in the village code to include properties outside the Register district, such as residences on some of the side streets and property north of the canal. Significant contributing properties All but one property (18 North Main Street) are considered contributing to the district's historic character. None are as yet individually listed on the National Register. *Burrows Block, 123‚Äì131¬Ω North Main Street.

Miller was the father of U.S. Representative George Miller III. History Miller was a native Californian, educated at St. Mary's College in Contra Costa County, where he began his political career. After his election to the legislature, Miller ran unsuccessfully for Lt. Governor in 1950Miller actually lost the Democratic primary to the Republican, future Governor Goodwin Knight, who \\"cross-filed\\" on the Democratic ballot. as running mate to losing gubernatorial candidate James Roosevelt, who, together with US Senate candidate Helen Gahagan Douglas, was deserted by the old-line state Democratic organization of San Francisco boss William M. Malone, with the acquiescence of Truman's Washington.Bertram Coffey, Reflections on George Miller, Jr., Governors Pat and Jerry Brown and the Democratic Party, Oral History interview, Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley, 1978. The only Democratic state candidate to win in 1950 was Attorney General Pat Brown. Miller had another disappointment that year when he sought the chairmanship of the California Democratic Party. Roosevelt and Douglas at first encouraged and supported him for the position, but then \\"double-crossed\\" Miller, who was opposed by Malone, and instead chose a little-known man from the San Joaquin Valley. Miller chose not to contest the back-room decision. \\"If that's the way they want it\\", he said in his gruff voice, \\"to hell with it\\".Roger Kent and Don Bradley, Oral Histories, Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley, 1976-79. Two years later, in 1952, Miller was one of the few California Democratic office-holders to become an early supporter of Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver's campaign for the presidency. The regular Party organization had originally supported the re-election of President Harry Truman, but when Truman withdrew from the race, the Party professionals, in desperation, coalesced around Pat Brown as their \\"favorite son\\". In the June Primary, Kefauver easily defeated the Brown slate and the winning California delegation to the 1952 Democratic National Convention, largely composed of Kefauver supporters, chose Miller as delegation chairman. Kefauver later lost the Convention nomination to Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson, a late entry into the race, but that fall, both the Truman professionals and the Kefauver and Stevenson amateurs at last united in selecting Miller as the new Chairman of the state Democratic Party. Starting from scratch, during his two years as Party chair, hoping to reverse the series of stinging Democratic defeats, Miller used his official influence to become a founding father, in 1953, of the California Democratic Council, the unofficial grassroots \\"club movement\\" organization that helped bring the Democrats to power in Sacramento in 1958 with Pat Brown's election as Governor. Miller laid the groundwork for this success. \\"He is an earthy, engaging man\\", wrote Political Science Professor Francis Carney in 1958, \\"whose conversation is characterized by warmth and vigor...his steadfast championing of new party organizations..secured him a reputation for vision and courage ... he has that remarkable, rare and valuable - though hardly palpable - political asset called a following. He is, in other words 'available' for higher office and the knowledge of this within the party assures him a measure of influence.\\"Francis Carney. The Rise of the Democratic Clubs in California (Eagleton Foundation Case Studies in Practical Politics, 1958) Miller did not seek higher office, neither in the year of Brown's victory, nor in the subsequent ten years of his life during which he remained in the State Senate, becoming chair of the Senate Finance Committee and sometimes wary legislative collaborator of Speaker of the Assembly Jesse Unruh. He worked even more closely with Governor Brown, with whom Unruh was often feuding, to insure the success of the Governor's legislative agenda. Brown's campaign manager and political strategist, Don Bradley, was an old and close friend of Miller, whom he called \\"the best politician I ever ran into\\", and they worked closely together to \\"engineer\\" the election of more liberal Democrats to the State Senate; their unsung efforts \\"changed the ideological complexion\\" of the conservative upper house, and thus \\"made possible the enactment of much of the Democratic legislation\\" of the Brown years.Bill Boyarsky, Big Daddy: Jesse Unruh and the Art of Power Politics (University of California Press, 2008), p. 104 Death & Legacy Miller died in office unexpectedly, six days before his 55th birthday, two years after Governor Brown was defeated for re-election by Ronald Reagan.

Centered on Courthouse Square, it includes many significant buildings in the village, such as its post office and churches from seven different denominations, one of which is the tallest structure in the county. Many buildings are the work of local architect William V.N. Barlow, with contributions from Solon Spencer Beman and Andrew Jackson Warner. They run the range of architectural styles from the era in which the district developed, from Federal to Colonial Revival. Most of its buildings date to the 19th century, with some erected in the early 20th, a period when Albion was prospering not only as the county seat but as a stop on the Erie Canal, which passes through the village a short distance north of the district. A number of the buildings, including the county courthouse, use locally quarried Medina sandstone. In 1979 it was recognized as a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Geography The district is square-shaped with two protrusions on its northeast and southwest corners. Its boundaries follow lot lines. The entire Courthouse Square is included, and all the properties facing it on South Main (state highway NY 98), East State, South Platt and East Park Streets. On the southwest it continues along West Park to include all corners of the Liberty Street intersection, and likewise it continues along East State Street east of Platt to include all properties as far as Ingersoll Street. This roughly area includes 35 buildings, all but two of which are considered contributing properties to the district's overall historic character, built between 1830 and 1910 in various contemporary architectural styles. It is a densely developed urban core, on land sloping gently to the north. Albion's other downtown historic district, the more commercially oriented North Main-Bank Street area, borders on the north and extends to the canal, now part of the New York State Barge Canal system. Many of the buildings along South Main, the principal vehicular route through the district, are massed, bulky structures of stone or brick. The district's original focal point, the metallic dome of the Greek Revival county courthouse, is set off by a similarly large county clerk's building of later construction to its south and the modern, non- contributing county jail to the southeast. Around the courthouse buildings is the only open space in the district, planted in mature tall trees on the west (front) of the courthouse and taken up with a parking lot to the south. The neighboring streets complement the courthouse complex with large institutional buildings like the village's Swan Library and the seven churches. The spire of the Old English Gothic First Presbyterian Church to the north is a focal point for the region ‚Äî as the tallest structure in Orleans County, it can be seen from 10 miles (16 km) away on clear days. On the far corners, the larger buildings give way to smaller buildings and houses. History The district's active development can be split into two phases: the years from the creation of Orleans County to the construction of the new courthouse, when development was mostly residential and slower-paced; and the years after the current courthouse was built, when larger scale buildings were constructed at a faster rate. During the 20th century some renovations were made, and only two new buildings were added. 1824‚Äì1858: Before the courthouse When Orleans County was split from Genesee County to the south in 1824, a group of state commissioners visited the new county to choose the seat. At the time the choice was between Albion and Gaines to the northwest, then the two largest settlements in the county and relatively centrally located within it. The commissioners were impressed when Nehemiah Ingersoll, one of Albion's more prominent citizens, took them on a tour which showed its access to water power. The next year the Erie Canal was opened, putting Albion on a major trade route across the state, giving local farmers access to distant markets. On the remains of a former glacial drumlin, a log cabin had been built in 1811 by William McAllister, one of the first buildings in what would become Albion. The area around it began to develop. Two churches were built across the square, the First Presbyterian Church on South Main in 1830 (currently Christ Episcopal Church) and the First United Methodist Church at East State and Platt. The Mahaney and Bullock houses, on South Main and Liberty respectively, were built around this time. The former, a three-bay Federal style structure with elliptical arched entrance and saddleback roof, is typical of the application of the style around Western New York at that time. The latter, later home to Reconstruction-era Georgia Governor Rufus Brown Bullock, is possibly the oldest building in the district. Its recessed panels beneath the first floor's arches recall Charles Bulfinch's influential Second Harrison Gray Otis House in Boston. alt=Three brick buildings seen from across a road, slightly to the right. The one at left has a small tower and ornate roofline, the center one is painted red, and the one at right has a square tower in front with a red door. In 1840 a large brick residence at the corner of Main and State streets was built in the Greek Revival style for Alexis Ward, the first president of the Village of Albion. The First Presbyterian Church's second building, now its chapel, demonstrates how it was applied locally. Other than the cast iron leaves of the front columns' Corinthian capitals, its brick exterior is devoid of ornament. Similarly the interior is decorated only with a plaster ceiling medallion. This austerity may reflect both the conservative tastes of the congregation at that time and their possibly limited construction budget. The house of Sanford E. Church, later lieutenant governor and chief judge of the Court of Appeals, New York's highest court, also added Greek Revival elements to a Federal design. Located at East State and Ingersoll, it is the most prominent residence in the district. Its Doric colonnade acknowledges changing trends, but their slenderness along with the house's elliptical fanlight and clapboard siding suggests that its builder was not yet ready to fully embrace them. A few years earlier, quarries near the village of Medina to the west had found a reddish-brown local variety of sandstone. Soon quarries near Albion began producing it as well, and it became a major local industry, producing much of what was called brownstone when used in New York City, as well as all the steps of Henry Hobson Richardson's \\"Million Dollar Staircase\\" in the state capitol. It would take a while to be used for Albion's downtown other than curbs, steps or window trim. In the meantime, the Italianate style quietly debuted in Albion with the Porter House at 33 Platt Street in 1855. Five years earlier the Preston House at 118 East State Street had been built in a consciously Colonial style. alt=A brick building with four white columns in front and a silvery dome on top 1858‚Äì89: The courthouse and after In the late 1850s the county was beginning to outgrow its original courthouse. A committee of the county's board of supervisors that traveled to Lyons, the Wayne County seat, was impressed enough with the courthouse there that the board decided it should be the model for their new one. For the design, they chose William V.N. Barlow, a young local architect for whom the courthouse would be his signature building but also the first of many contributions to the district as either designer or builder. His courthouse building, completed in 1858, was an ornate Greek Revival structure with a tall, gilded dome wide like its model. Its embrace of the style contrasted with the more restrained use of it on older buildings nearby like the Presbyterian chapel and Church House. The front columns were tall, and the dome top twice that height. The cupola was once open to visitors, allowing for views to Lake Ontario to the north in clear weather.Townsend, 12. Two years later, the First Baptist Church on West Park Street matched the scale of the new courthouse with a structure combining Gothic (steep buttresses and a tall hexagonal tower rising from the center of the front facade) and Romanesque elements (round arched windows and corbel tables). Also built that year was the first house of worship in the Free Methodist Church, started by abolitionists, on East State Street. It too combined the styles, with Romanesque proportions and Carpenter Gothic design touches. The building's vertical battens are topped with unmolded block capitals, suggesting the building's unknown architect was considerably refined in the use of the style. After the Civil War the village prospered. Since 1853, when the New York Central Railroad had absorbed the Rochester, Lockport and Niagara Falls Railroad, which ran through the village paralleling the canal to the south, its agricultural products and sandstone had been shipped to many distant markets. Growth in the district continued apace. The Methodists built an Italianate parsonage on Platt Street in 1865, and during the 1870s Barlow and others built new houses, introducing styles like the Second Empire and its mansard roof on the 1879 White-Martilotta House at 134 East State Street, the largest home built in the district since Church's. Barlow also built the Italian villa-style brick home for local merchant William Gere on the southwest corner of West Park and South Main, which now serves as the rectory for St. Joseph's Church. When local banker and politician Elizur Hart died in 1870, he left $50,000 (approximately $950,000 in contemporary dollars) for the construction of a new First Presbyterian Church. He specifically stipulated that the new church's spire be taller than the one on the Baptist church. Andrew Jackson Warner was commissioned to design the new church. He delivered the current building, made entirely of rusticated stone, which he had become familiar with while working on Henry Hobson Richardson's Buffalo State Hospital earlier in his career. The English Gothic style chosen was also well-adapted to the material, since the 13th- century churches used as models were usually made of local stone. Some aspects of the design, such as the placement of the tower, the rose window and the placement of the details, suggest the influence of Richard Upjohn, whose 1859 Third Presbyterian Church in Rochester Warner would also have been familiar with. The spire, when finished the following year, reached , making it the tallest structure not only in the village but the county. A manse squarely in the Colonial Revival style was also built that year. In 1885, Barlow introduced two new styles to Albion. The Warner House at 21 East Park is the village's first Queen Anne, and just down the street at 34 East Park he brought the Eastlake style, where the decoration is made of the same material as the surface it is on, to Albion. Three years later, it got a higher-profile placement with the Surrogate's Building just south of the courthouse. Rochester architect Harvey Ellis dotted the faces of the building, made entirely of fireproof materials, with inventive brickwork. \\"From that point on\\", wrote a critic decades later, \\"his genius as a practitioner of the true fine art of building begins to sing\\". Yet another emerging style, Colonial Revival was brought to the district at the end of the decade by Barlow. In 1889 he oversaw the renovation of the 50-year-old residence at Main and State into the Swan Library. Most of the exterior was redecorated for the new style. Inside, its original Greek Revival woodwork remains intact except for a large reading room redone in Colonial Revival. 1890s: Two churches The 1890s saw two of the district's churches, among them one of its most distinctive, built through the generosity of local benefactors. All used Medina sandstone, reflecting the prosperity of the region at the time. Pullman Memorial Universalist Church The next year George Pullman, the railroad-car entrepreneur who had lived in Albion as a young cabinetmaker during the late 1840s and into the 1850s, agreed to build a Universalist church in the village (named Pullman Memorial Universalist Church). He commissioned Solon Spencer Beman, who had designed his company town outside Chicago. Beman saw that the Medina sandstone was particularly well-suited to the Richardsonian Romanesque style, and produced a compact church of rough-hewn blocks of that material, with unmolded window trim revealing the thickness of the face. While it uses pointed arches instead of the round ones Richardson preferred, the tower evokes the older architect's Trinity Church in Boston. The interior echoes Richardson as well in contrasting the exterior's heaviness and seriousness with space and bright color, including the Tiffany stained glass window and golden oak ceiling beams. The last of the two churches of the 1890s was a spite building. William Stafford, a member of the Baptist Church and Orleans County District Attorney, ran for reelection and lost. He felt his loss was partly due to his fellow congregants failure to sufficiently support him. He sold the land he owned next to the Baptist Church to St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church, which was outgrowing its current location on Main Street north of the Erie Canal. According to local legend, the property was sold under the condition that a new church on the property be built close enough to West Park Street to block the view of the Baptist church from Main Street. The Gothic Revival building, designed by an unknown architect, is smaller in scale and less decorated than the other churches, but does block the view to the Baptist Church from Main Street. 1900‚Äìpresent: Decline and preservation A few more buildings were added to the district in the early 20th century, and some others were renovated. A tower with the board-and-batten siding was added to the Free Methodist Church in 1900, and St. Joseph's built a school in 1913. Later that year the Pullman church built a parsonage of its own. Its Colonial Revival design, featuring a delicate half-ellipse, evoked the very same Federal and Greek Revival buildings that had been built in the nearby blocks when the area was first developed. The industries that made Albion prosperous started to decline after that decade. The canal was enlarged and made part of the New York State Barge Canal system in 1918, which failed to stop the loss of traffic to railroads that were growing ever more efficient. By the 1920s Portland cement had become common and cheap enough that the sandstone quarries were losing customers. The courthouse was renovated in the late 1920s. Late in the Depression, in 1937, a new post office in the Colonial Revival style was built opposite the courthouse and library, with two Greek Revival homes that had been there demolished in the process. Note: This includes Swan Library itself was redecorated in 1952, only to have the original color scheme restored in 1975. Shortly before that the modernist new county jail had been built, the most recent construction in the district. An interest in preserving the village's downtown culminated in the 1979 listing on the Register. The village created a Historic Preservation Commission to oversee its historic districts. It is charged with protecting and enhancing the landmarks within them and making the village more attractive to visitors in order to ensure growth and development. Significant contributing properties None of the district's 33 contributing properties is currently independently listed on the National Register. The post office, within the district, was listed after the district, but is not considered to be contributing to the district because it was built after 1910, the end of the district's period of significance. *Rufus Brown Bullock House, 36 Liberty Street.

Before joining CDC in 2007, Trevathan was professor of neurology and pediatrics, as well as director of the Division of Pediatric & Developmental Neurology, at Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine and was neurologist-in-chief at St. Louis Children's Hospital.https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/AboutUs/biographies/Trevathan.html Early career As an Epidemic Intelligence Service IEIS) officer at CDC in the late 1980s, Trevathan chaired an international committee of experts in child neurology, genetics, and developmental pediatrics who defined the diagnostic criteria for a then new neurogenetic disorder, Rett syndrome.The Rett Syndrome Diagnostic Criteria Workgroup. Diagnostic Criteria for Rett syndrome. Annals of Neurology 1988;23(4):425-8. In his early years at CDC, he also helped develop public health surveillance systems for developmental disabilities, and established the first major surveillance system for childhood epilepsy.Murphy CC, Trevathan E, Yeargin-Allsopp M. Prevalence of epilepsy and epileptic seizures in 10-year-old children: results from the Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Study. Epilepsia 1995;36(9):866-72. After his training and service as an EIS officer, Trevathan entered private practice child neurology and was a founding partner in Child Neurology Associates in Atlanta, where he established and directed a comprehensive children's epilepsy center at Scottish Rite Children's Hospital - now part of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. In 1995, Trevathan returned to academic medicine as the director of the comprehensive epilepsy program and the associate director of the neurology service at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine. In 1998, he was recruited to Washington University School of Medicine and to St. Louis Children's Hospital, where he was a professor and directed the Pediatric Epilepsy Center, which grew to become one of the largest epilepsy centers dedicated to the care of children in the US.http://neuro.wustl.edu/patientcare/clinicalservices/pediatricepilepsycenter/ In 2004, Trevathan was appointed director of the Division of Pediatric and Developmental Neurology at Washington University School of Medicine, and neurologist-in-chief at St. Louis Children's Hospital. During Trevathan's tenure, the child neurology training program at Washington University and St. Louis Children's Hospital grew to be one of the largest in the US, and the number of child neurology faculty grew to 22 full-time neurologists.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2007-2010)  From 2007-2010, Trevathan was a member of the senior leadership team at the CDC, and director of the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD). While director of NCBDDD/CDC Trevathan supervised many of CDC's activities related to infant and child health, genetics, neurodevelopmental disorders, disabilities, and blood disorders. NCBDDD's programs include public health surveillance, research, and prevention activities related congenital heart defects, nervous system malformations (e.g. spina bifida and hydrocephalus), hemophilia, sickle cell anemia, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, cerebral palsy, autism, health promotion among adults with disability, and early diagnosis of genetic, metabolic and developmental disorders.https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/index.html Trevathan also served as the strategic lead for the CDC response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, which disproportionately impacted pregnant women, children, and children with neurological disabilities.CDC assembles experts to address pediatric issues in H1N1 outbreak. AAP News (Official Newsmagazine of the American Academy of Pediatrics) Vol. 30, No. 6. June, 2009 at www.aapnews.org He represented CDC on several national committees such as the National Children's Study Federal Advisory Committee member, the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee, and the Muscular Dystrophy Coordinating Committee.  College for Public Health & Social Justice, Saint Louis University (2010-2015)  In 2010 Trevathan returned to St. Louis to serve as dean of the School of Public Health at Saint Louis University (SLU). Trevathan started as dean two years after almost half the school's faculty left the university when the school's previous dean, Connie Evashwick, was fired for attempting to move the SLU School of Public Health to Washington University in St. Louis; Dr. Evashwick later unsuccessfully sued SLU for sexual discrimination. With support from the SLU president, Lawrence Biondi, Trevathan led a major expansion of the School of Public Health with over 30 new faculty positions, and then in 2012 the formation of the new College for Public Health and Social Justice, which included the SLU School of Social Work. As the only accredited public health college among the one hundred seventy-two Jesuit universities throughout the world, Trevathan led an expansion of the college's global health programs, including a Masters of Public Health (MPH) concentration in global health, establishment of public health educational programs at SLU's campus in Madrid, Spain, and expansion of global health research activities.  Baylor University (2015-2016)  Baylor University recruited Trevathan to serve as Executive Vice President and Provost, or chief academic officer, working under Chancellor Kenneth W. Starr (Baylor University President, 2010-2016). In spite of their obvious differences, Starr (a partisan Republican and lawyer) and Trevathan (a physician-scientist and Democrat), initially found a common passion in expanding high quality research and graduate education at the nation's largest Baptist university. Trevathan resigned as executive vice president and provost in early 2016, amid resistance apparently by President Starr to Trevathan's call for a more diverse and inclusive faculty as an essential component to Baylor's rise as a national research university, and as the university's leadership attention drifted away from expanding research and graduate education to focus on the problems with the football program. A few months after Trevathan stepped down as executive vice president and provost, Ken Starr was fired as Baylor University's president amid controversy. In public Trevathan has been vague regarding the reasons for his leaving Baylor, but in an interview with Inside Higher Ed Trevathan spoke in very general terms regarding his views of diversity within universities, and stated \\"Although much progress has been made within U.S. universities, pockets of institutional racism and xenophobia persist. Those of us in the majority must be willing to change our policies and structures in order to treat those in the minority with equality, dignity and respect.\\" Trevathan went on to state that \\"Christian institutions resistant to diversity sometimes cite their devotion to traditions, or 'religious freedom' as justification for overt discrimination against an entire segment of the population. It is often easy for leaders of these institutions to bend to the pressured calls for 'no change'. As a matter of conscience, and in order to enhance academic excellence, I choose to distance myself from policies of exclusion and discrimination.\\" Professional activities He has served as a counselor of the Professors of Child Neurology, and has served on the editorial boards of major journals such as Neurology, Disability and Health Journal, and Journal of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease. Trevathan has been an active clinical investigator and served as the principal investigator for several clinical trials of treatments for epilepsy.Motte J, Trevathan E, Arvidsson JF, Barera MN, Mullens EL, Manasco P.

Only 1,728 units were built.  Model history  The MR-300 was designed as a cheap car for the masses. The idea to design this construction, one of very few automobiles manufactured in Poland, arose coincidentally. At the end of 1956 the authorities decided to make use of spare production capacity at the aerospace manufacturers WSK Mielec and WSK Rzesz√≥w. At the time, both plants were only producing planes and motorcycles. The new plan was to add automobile manufacture as well. During the initial period WSK Rzesz√≥w prepared plans for the engine, while WSK Mielec focused on the chassis and bodywork. The design was presented at the beginning of 1957, during the National Automotive Meeting. The first prototypes were presented on 22 July 1957 in Warsaw. The new car was named Mikrus MR 300 (taking its name from the initials of the words Mielec and Rzesz√≥w). By the end of the year, the first cars left the assembly plant. In addition, two convertible models were available. Press reports at the time stated: ‚ÄúTaking into consideration the price, which should not exceed the price of a similar cubic capacity motorcycle by more than 25-30% we may assume that it will constitute a very popular means of transportation for a wide spectrum of users‚Äù. The Mikrus turned out to be very popular. However, the high cost of manufacture prevented the idea from developing into a mass, individual motorization. At the same time, the high price of the vehicle meant few could afford it. The Mikrus cost 50 thousand Polish Z≈Çoty, the average of 50 salaries. The much larger Warszawa cost 120 thousand Polish Z≈Çoty.  Mikrus pick-up  In 1960 when the manufacture of the Mikrus was ended the WSK Mielec construction office prepared within 10 days a prototype of a pick-up version. This was in response to a Government directive which ordered the manufacturers to produce a compact panel truck. The demand of the Polish market was estimated at the level of 100 thousand units. The vehicle could transport a load not exceeding . The same arrangement of wheels and suspension as in the original was used. The loading part could be covered with a canvas cloak. Like the convertible, this design did not go into mass production.

It served the nearby village of Husthwaite. When the Thirsk and Malton Line was completed in 1853, there was originally no station near Husthwaite. However, a single platform on the north side of the single line was provided by 1856, east of the crossing with the minor road from Husthwaite to Carlton Husthwaite, known as Elphin Bridge Lane. A stationmaster's house, incorporating the ticket office, was built on the opposite side of the crossing. A goods siding in front of the stationmaster's house was built at the cost of Sir George Wombwell, a local landowner. In 1872, it was taken into public use and Wombwell's outlay was refunded. In 1880, a tramway was built to connect the goods siding to Angram Wood, north east of the station. This was used to forward timber from Angram to for processing. The gauge of the tramway is unknown. In 1856, a single train plied the route between and three times daily. This had risen to four trains a day by 1895. In 1906, services on the line amounted to six trains each way, five of which went south to and one which ran north to Pilmoor and offered a connecting service via the Pilmoor, Boroughbridge and Knaresborough Railway to . The station was closed to passengers in January 1953, but the line was still used by long-distance passenger traffic and excursions. It remained as a goods station but became an unmanned delivery siding from October 1963. The station was closed in August 1964, having latterly been serviced with trains only from the east. An accident in March 1963 on the East Coast Main Line damaged Sessay Wood Junction and it was never repaired. The line was closed in 1964, and the track pulled up in the following year. A brick course of the platform remains. The stationmaster's house is a private dwelling, and the station sidings area is now a campsite.

The first document, the \\"Left Wing Manifesto of the Left Wing Section of Local Greater New York\\" was the program over which the split of the Socialist Party of America into Left and Right factions was fought. It was created in January 1919. The second document, the \\"Left Wing Manifesto of the Left Wing National Council\\", was a more obscure document produced at the end of June 1919, well after the factional battle lines had been hardened. This latter document was used as a pretext for prosecutions of several key radical leaders by the state of New York. \\"Left Wing Manifesto\\" issued by Left Wing Section, Local Greater New York At the end of 1918, following the termination of American participation in World War I and in the wake of the party's poor showing in the November elections, a radical faction emerged in the Socialist Party of America. This group sought to transform the parliamentary SPA into a revolutionary socialist organization comparable to the Bolshevik organizations springing up across Europe. In January 1919 a joint meeting of representatives of all the SP branches of Local Greater New York was called. The meeting was chaired by Julius Gerber, Executive Secretary of Local Greater New York who did his best to steer the meeting away from the passionate discussion of strategy and tactics which the Left Wing members so anxiously desired. When delegates from Queens attempted to win the floor at 11:30 pm, only to be ruled out of order, a number of radicals bolted the hall and gathered in a meeting room of their own. A City Committee of 14 was elected, with Max Cohen named as Executive Secretary. The group was to compose a manifesto and wage a campaign to win over the rank and file of the party to the ideas of revolutionary socialism. It was this group which wrote the famous Left Wing Manifesto, a document extensively revised by Louis C. Fraina, editor of the weekly newspaper of the Left Wing Section, Local Boston, The Revolutionary Age.Theodore Draper, The Roots of American Communism. New York: Viking Press, 1957. Page 145. The document begins:\\"Manifesto,\\" in Revolutionary Radicalism, 706 :Prior to August, 1914, the nations of the world lived on a volcano. Violent eruptions from time to time gave warning of the cataclysm to come, but the diplomats and statesmen managed to localize the outbreaks, and the masses, slightly aroused, sank back into their accustomed lethargy with doubts and misgivings, and the subterranean fires continued to smoulder.\\" This \\"Left Wing Manifesto\\" was published in pamphlet format and was hotly debated throughout the American socialist movement prior to the split of the Socialist Party at the 1919 Emergency National Convention held in Chicago during the first week of September. \\"Left Wing Manifesto\\" issued by the Left Wing National Council The second so-called \\"Left Wing Manifesto,\\" followed the first and took inspiration from it, but was altogether different in content. This second Left Wing Manifesto was issued on the authority of the National Council of the Left Wing and was published in its final form in the July 5, 1919, edition of The Revolutionary Age.Louis C. Fraina (ed.), The Revolutionary Age, v. 2, no. 1 (July 5, 1919), pp. 6-9, 14-15. The complete run of The Revolutionary Age was published as an elephant folio book by Greenwood Reprint Corp., Westport, CT, in 1968 as part of their series \\"Radical Periodicals in the United States, 1890-1960.\\" The publication was simultaneously released on microfilm by Greenwood. The publication of this document by the organized Left Wing section was used as the basis of prosecution of C.E. Ruthenberg, I.E. Ferguson, Benjamin Gitlow, and others for violation of the New York Criminal Anarchism statutes. This document begins:\\"The Left Wing Manifesto (Issued on Authority of the Conference by the National Council of the Left Wing),\\" in Revolutionary Radicalism, 716 :The world is in crisis. Capitalism, the prevailing system of society, is in process of disintegration and collapse. Out of its vitals is developing a new social order, the system of Communist Socialism; and the struggle between this new social order and the old, is now the fundamental problem of international politics.\\" References Documents * Manifesto and Program of the Left Wing Section Socialist Party, Local Greater New York.

Produced for television, the film serves as a sequel to the 1987 Hallmark Hall of Fame film, The Secret Garden. It contains some of the previous characters such as Lady Mary and Sir Colin Craven, who are now married, and Martha Sowerby, who is now the mistress of Misselthwaite Manor, which has become an orphanage for children whose parents died in World War II. They had appeared as children in the original story some 40 years earlier, and are now middle aged adults. Plot In 1946, Lady Mary Craven (Cherie Lunghi) visits an American orphanage, telling the children about an exchange program that will allow one child to travel to England and stay at Misselthwaite Manor, now an orphanage. She meets young Lizzie Buscana (Camilla Belle), who is in the garden trying to take care of her mother's rose bush. Lady Mary tells Lizzie about the exchange program and the secret garden, whereupon Lizzie agrees to participate so she can see the garden for herself. Lizzie arrives in England and is met at the train station by Martha Sowerby (Joan Plowright), who runs Misselthwaite Manor. Lizzie quickly discovers that the children are only allowed to be in the garden on Sunday after church and must be on their best behaviour and not touch anything. Making friends with Geraldine, Steven and Robert (Aled Roberts), Lizzie visits the garden after curfew and realizes that she must help it. Returning to the manor Lizzie notices a fire in Robert's room, caused by Robert having fallen asleep with a candle still lit. After alerting everyone and helping put out the fire, she is questioned by Martha as to why she is still dressed and how she knew there was a fire. Lizzie tells Martha about her illicit visit to the garden, and Martha discovers that Lizzie stole the key to the garden. Martha discovers that Geraldine told Lizzie about the key, but Geraldine believes the key should belong to Lizzie, and that the garden has chosen her, instead of Martha, who could not find the door. Geraldine (Florence Hoath), who is jealous of Lizzie, learns that Ms. Sowerby gave the key to Lizzie, and persuades Steven to steal it in revenge for Lizzie's rejection of his feelings. When Lizzie finds the key missing, she assumes that Robert has taken it, knowing of his animosity towards her. She goes to find the key with Robert and discovers that it was Steven (Justin Girdler) who took it, on Geraldine's instructions, and threw the key in the pond. Lizzie confronts Geraldine, who initially denies it, but confesses when Martha punishes her for being a liar. Lizzie is told that maybe she does not need the key, because of the magic door. When Martha goes to meet Lady Mary, who has returned to Misselthwaite, she tells Mary of the garden's untended state, even though it has been well-tended in her absence. Lizzie realises that the garden has been starved of children's love and fun; with the help of Robert she gathers the orphans, who run to the quickly-reviving garden. Lady Mary and Sir Colin (Leigh Lawson) arrive with Martha and are amazed, as the garden does not look dead as Martha had described. Lizzie tells Lady Mary that the garden needed love and that she should not have it closed. Lady Mary informs Lizzie that the garden belongs to her, and that it took \\"a girl from across the sea, many years ago\\" to bring the garden back to life, and that it has taken a girl from across the sea to do it again, and that it is up to her to do as she wishes with the garden. Lizzie announces that the garden will stay open so that all the children can enjoy it.

The Tongan, Tahitian, and Samoan variants are essentially identical in that the raw fish is briefly marinated in lemon or lime juice until the surface of the flesh becomes opaque. The fish is then mixed with coconut milk and diced vegetables (most commonly cucumber, tomato, onion, green onion, and spicy peppers). This is the national dish of Tonga. The dish is known as kokoda in Fiji, oka in Samoa ika mata in the Cook Islands, and simply poisson cru on the french islands.https://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&tbm;=bks&ei;=sWijXtShN4mEytMPs7KC0AU&q;=poisson+cru+vanatu+national+dish&oq;=poisson+cru+vanatu+national+dish&gs;_l=psy- ab.3...7316.9603.0.9956.12.12.0.0.0.0.213.1581.0j8j1.9.0....0...1c.1.64.psy- ab..4.0.0....0.vmpAUL9Q3Gs The word \\"ota\\" means \\"raw\\" in Samoan, Tongan, and Tahitian, although the more common term for the dish in French Polynesia is its French equivalent, \\"poisson cru\\" (literally, \\"raw fish\\"). Any type of seafood can be used to make \\"ota,\\" the word \\"ika\\" means fish (\\"i'a\\" in Samoan language), but the dish is often prepared with mussels (\\"ota pipi/maso\\"), prawns (\\"ota ulavai\\"), crab (\\"ota pa'a/paka\\"), lobster (\\"ota ula\\"), octopus/squid (\\"ota fe'e/feke\\"), sea urchin (\\"ota vana/tuitui\\"), and eel (\\"ota pusi\\"). A very similar dish is the kinilaw of the Philippines, and its descendant dish, the kelaguen of the Marianas Islands. The poke of Hawaii is also similar though it does not use citrus juices or coconut milk. It is also similar to the Latin American ceviche, though the latter is relatively recent and may be a derivative dish, as coconuts and citruses are not native to the Americas.

The collective is based in the Mission District of San Francisco, California where it writes, plays, and arranges jazz music while incorporating genres such as electronica, soul, funk, big band, symphonic, and hip-hop. Its founder and leader, trombonist and bass guitarist Adam Theis, participates in at least ten bands, including Realistic Orchestra, Shotgun Wedding Quintet, Shotgun Wedding Hip-Hop Symphony, Jazz Mafia Horns, Supertaster, and the Joe Bagale Band. Adam Theis and history Adam Theis grew up in Santa Rosa, California and Sebastopol, California. Theis came from a non musical family, yet he began playing trombone in fourth grade after his neighbor introduced him to the instrument. His music teacher Ken Winett turned him on to different genres including jazz, gospel, and Jamaican pre-reggae rhythms. Theis‚Äô passion for jazz changed his junior year of high school. At the time Theis was in a garage band. One day the band was locked out of their practice room and were left with only horn instruments, so they decided to play their band's songs on the horns. That moment changed his perception of Jazz music.Cushing, Ellen. \\"Jazz's Mafioso; Adam Theis' Brass, Bows and Beats merges hip-hop, classical, jazz, and electronic..\\" East Bay Express 19 Aug 2009, Print. Theis studied jazz composition at Sonoma State University. His professional career started when he met a member of Grand Junction. They asked Theis and his friend to play for their horn section, becoming valuable members to the group and other groups who needed stable and available horn players.Rubien, David. \\"In this mafia, that really is a horn in the music case; Music.\\" San Francisco Chronicle19 Apr 2009, Final: F3. Print In 1998, Theis moved to San Francisco‚Äôs Mission District and founded the San Francisco Jazz Mafia which now consists of The Shotgun Wedding Quintet, The Jazz Mafia Symphony, Realistic Orchestra and many more. The first official group under the umbrella of Jazz Mafia, Realistic, started when various jazz forces in the Bay Area started to collaborate and jam together. Before organizing the various groups under the Jazz Mafia title, Theis participated in a number of Bay Area bands including Cannonball, named after Cannonball Adderley. The horn section of the Jazz Mafia started becoming known for backing up such artists as Carlos Santana, Spearhead, KRS-One, Zion I, and Thomas Dolby. Theis is the center of Jazz Mafia, playing multiple roles. He is a bassist/trombonist for Jazz Mafia affiliate Shotgun Wedding Quintet which he co-leads with the other 4 members of the quintet, he is the conductor and chief arranger of the 50 piece Jazz Mafia Symphony and leads his own classical/crossover string quartet. He also schedules rehearsals, hustles gigs, and does publicity. One of Theis‚Äô goals was to create a group that centers on the concept of community. Theis knows market for finding gigs is tough, but wants to disband some of the cliquishness of the jazz scene. In 2008, Theis was awarded the prestigious Gerbode-Hewlett Foundation ‚ÄúEmerging Composers‚Äù Grant. With the grant secured, Theis was able to schedule The event at the Palace of Fine arts presented by SF Jazz, on April 18, 2009.

Aima The Dreamer, Soulati and Infinite Sound The various groups' sound has been compared with David Axelrod. One writer compared the approach to \\"what you'd hear if a full-size philharmonic found itself jamming with a classic big band during a street-corner rap battle\\", and another to Cab Calloway and his orchestra. Notable events and compositions In 2007 the Jazz Mafia Horns went on a nationwide tour with 1980s new wave musician Thomas Dolby. Their performance that year at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas became the basis of a joint album, and was part of the 2000-decade revival of Dolby's live performance career. In 2008, Theis was commissioned by SFJAZZ (a local jazz organization), under a grant from the Wallace Alexander Gerbode and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundations, to write a symphonic work that would be accessible to a diverse audience. The result, Brass, Bows, and Beats, is an hour-long piece for large brass band, string section, orchestra, turntablist, singers, rappers, and keyboardist. The premier, featuring a 60-piece orchestra at San Francisco's Palace of Fine Arts, was sold out and received \\"ecstatic\\" reviews. The success of the first performance encouraged the group to continue performing, including 3 sold out performances in August, 2009 at Yoshi's, a large San Francisco Jazz club. In 2009, the Jazz Mafia played a sold-out tribute to Michael Jackson, also at Yoshi's. The collective has had regular residencies at San Francisco clubs, including Bruno's and Black Cat (both no longer jazz clubs), Coda (where they and bassist Marcus Shelby played opening night)and Yoshi's. The Jazz Mafia Symphony continued in 2010, performing the \\"Brass Bows and Beats\\" symphony at the Playboy, Montreal, Monterey, and Newport Jazz fests- to enthusiastic audiences.

It is down the main line from London Fenchurch Street via and it is situated between to the west and to the east. Its three-letter station code is SOE. It was opened in 1932. The station and all trains serving it are currently operated by c2c. History London, Tilbury and Southend (1884-1922) The railway through the site was opened on 1884 when the London Tilbury and Southend Railway was extended eastwards from Southend to Shoeburyness. Increasing traffic levels saw the need for an intermediate block signal box called Southend East to be provided in order that more trains could run and this was provided in 1896 on the down side east of Southend station. As central Southend developed and the resort expanded it became clear that better goods facilities would be required and a new goods yard was provided on the down side just to the east of the signal box in 1907. Southend was a popular seaside resort for Londoners and additional trains were run in the summer and bank holidays. To cater for these new carriage sidings were laid on the down side west of the site in 1910. In 1912 the LT&SR; was taken over by the Midland Railway and after World War 1 following the Railways Act 1921 the line and station became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) London Midland and Scottish Railway (1923-1947) The station was opened by the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) on 28 March 1932 for excursion traffic only with three platforms supplied on the Up Main and two platforms on a loop to the south also on the up side of the layout. A new signal box named Southend East was provided with the 1896 signal box being renamed Southend Sidings. The opening day was marred by a minor derailment and according to local newspaper reports usage was fairly low. In early 1933 a fourth platform was supplied on the Down Main to better cater for down stopping trains. The stations use as an excursion station seems to have been limited and the excursion platforms were used for a few originating/terminating trains during the weekday peaks. British Railways (1948-1994) After nationalisation on 1 January 1948 the line became part of British Railways London Midland Region but on 20 February 1949 the whole LTS line was transferred to the Eastern Region, yet despite the organisational changes, the old LTSR still was a distinctive system operated by former LTS and LMS locomotives until electrification. On 1 May of the same year the station was named to Southend-on-Sea East. The area was re-signalled in 1960 prior to electrification in 1961. From re-signalling the signal box was only operational when platforms 1 and 2 were in use. The goods yard was taken out of use on 5 December 1967. The station was renamed Southend East in 1969. From 1969 to 1981 platform 1 was used as the Southend Area parcels concentration depot. Once this traffic ceased there was no operational reason for platforms 1 and 2 to be retained and all connections were removed on 10 January 1982 and the signal box was never operated again. The main booking office and station building closed in 1969 being replaced by a smaller office on the former platform 4 (now platform 2). In 1986 the route was transferred to the Network SouthEast sector of British Rail. During this period, it was known as Network SouthEast's \\"misery line\\". Privatisation Era (1994-present day) On privatisation in 1996, infrastructure ownership passed to Railtrack and Prism Rail took over operations of the franchise, marketing the route as LTS Rail. Ownership passed to Network Rail in 2002. Prism Rail were bought out by National Express in 2000 and in 2002 the line was rebranded as c2c. National Express sold the operation of the franchise to Trenitalia in 2017. The main building was demolished in 2003. The station and all trains serving it are currently operated by c2c. Description Southend East has two through platforms. Platform 1 is typically for westbound trains towards London Fenchurch Street and platform 2 is for eastbound trains towards ; there is one disused platform. In April 2006, signs were erected with the label \\"Southend East for Southchurch Village\\" to better reflect its geographical location in the Southchurch area of Southend. During 2006, a ¬£425,000 refurbishment programme was completed at the station, providing level access to the London- bound platform, as well as new toilets, baby-changing facilities, a redecorated waiting room with CCTV, and a self-service ticket machine. The former parcels depot, which handled mainly credit-card post from the nearby Access site, was demolished and replaced with housing, the relevant platforms being infilled and paved over to provide a larger 'up' platform area. A ticket office is located adjacent to platform 1. It was completed in 2011 replacing the previous ticket office located adjacent to platform 2. It has two serving positions and uses the TRIBUTE ticket issuing system.  Services  The typical off-peak service frequency is: * 4 tph (trains per hour) westbound to London Fenchurch Street, of which: **2 tph call at all stations via ; **2 tph call at selected stations only via ; * 4 tph eastbound to calling at all stations.

These circuits are fully compatible with IRLP (Internet Radio Linking Project). IRLP is trademarked by Dave Cameron. The circuit shown below is the Deluxe PLRI interface, and is used to connect a radio to a PC using a parallel port and sound card. This circuit is fully compatible with the Version 3 IRLP board, and can be used in place of an IRLP board. This circuit allows negative or positive COS from the radio, and also supports negative or positive PTT keying. This circuit can be home built for roughly $20 US. File:plrid.jpg This circuit can be used with several software packages, such as Asterisk, Allstar, app_rpt, IRLP, RtpDir, TheLinkBox, Echolink Taylor 2004 or as a repeater controller board under any of the supported Linux software packages. History Development on the prototype interface began in 2008. All of the PLRI circuits are original designs by Kyle Yoksh, K0KN, and therefore not reverse-engineered from the IRLP board or elsewhere. The PLRI circuit has had three major revisions so far. Besides the interface shown here, there are also three other PLRI circuits. One is a multi-radio version that supports up to 5 radios to be controlled by a single parallel port, and also supports serial operation. One is an adapter to allow use of an IRLP board to be controlled by a serial port, and the other provides the AUX 1,2,3 outputs not found on early IRLP boards. All PLRI circuits can be found at http://www.qsl.net/k0kn/plri Construction The PLRI circuits are designed to use discrete components and DIP socketed integrated circuits for several reasons. For one thing, these are commonly found in ham operator's \\"junk boxes\\". Also, discrete transistors are able to sink more current than the tiny surface-mount transistors. Special soldering iron and magnifying glass not required! The PLRI interface consists of a hardware DTMF decoder, PTT circuit, COS circuit, and 3 auxiliary outputs for use with external circuits. The DTMF decoder circuit uses a MT8870 integrated circuit and a HCF4081 AND-gate integrated circuit. The AND-gate is used to provide a pulsed output to the PC parallel port, rather than the latched output of the MT8870. Auxiliary outputs 1,2,3 are built with NPN/PNP transistor pairs for several reasons. All outputs are capable of active high or active low switching. Active high switching allows for maximum switching current, as the NPN transistor is also used to light the corresponding LED and switch the PNP transistor. The PLRI interface can be connected directly to the radio(s), or connected to a Rigblaster-type interface The latter method is preferred, as the PLRI interface contains no audio circuitry such as isolation transformers or bypass capacitors. Other This project includes a set of electronic schematics of interest to radio amateurs (ham radio). These circuits are compatible with the IRLP voice-over-IP (VOIP) system, and can be used for Echolink, IRLP, Asterisk and D-STAR systems using the RtpDir or TheLinkBox software packages. As of 2011, the App_rpt package for Linux (also known as Asterisk) supports the parallel port for COS/PTT, and thus supports the PLRI board. The PRLI Deluxe Interface Circuit can be directly connected to the node radio(s), or connected to the node radio(s) via a standard Rigblaster-type radio interface.

Completed in 1917 and expanded in the 1930s, the building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Building history Prior to the annexation of the islands by the United States in 1898, Hilo was a thriving educational and commercial center on Hawaii, the largest of the Hawaiian Islands. Flourishing agricultural enterprises were served by railroads and harbors that facilitated trade with both the continental United States and East Asia. Postal services in Hilo commenced in 1858. When the Hawaiian Islands became a territory of the United States in 1900, officials wanted to expand postal and court facilities for the second-largest city in the territory. By 1913, the Hilo Board of Trade and the territory's governmental representative secured US$200,000 for a federal building. New York architect Henry Whitfield designed the new building in 1915. Whitfield, who was the brother-in-law of Andrew Carnegie, had just completed the design for the Honolulu Carnegie Library. Whitfield designed the building in the Mediterranean Renaissance Revival style, which blends traditional classical architecture with features more suited to a tropical climate. The building was one of the first in Hawaii constructed using reinforced concrete, a technology that was common on the mainland. Construction was completed and the building occupied in 1917. It originally functioned as a courthouse, post office, and custom house. Other tenants included the Immigration Bureau, Agricultural Extension Service, Weather Bureau, and Internal Revenue Service. By the 1930s, tenants required more space and two wings were added to the building between 1936 and 1938. Louis A. Simon, supervising architect of the US Treasury, designed the wings in a style compatible with that of the original building. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii on October 1, 1974 as site 74000708. In 1978, most postal functions moved to a new location, and the following year the Third Circuit Court vacated the third floor, which was converted into offices. The structure is located on the northern edge of downtown bounded by Waianuenue Avenue, Wailuku Drive, and Kinoole and Kekaulike streets at 154 Waianuenue Avenue (Route 200), , on Kalakaua Park square. Across the square is the historic former District Courthouse and Police Station. Architecture Whitfield's design blends classically inspired forms and motifs with features that are suitable for the warm Hawaiian climate. It is particularly noteworthy for its use of reinforced concrete, and it is one of the earliest buildings in the area to be constructed of permanent materials. The reinforced concrete building is covered with painted stucco. The original building was rectangular, and the wing additions extend forward from the facade to form a U-shape. The facade is organized around a central courtyard. The building is three stories in height with a penthouse. Open-air loggias divided into three distinct levels face the courtyard and provide occupants with pleasant views and circulating air currents. The loggias also function as exterior corridors and provide primary circulation for occupants. One of the building's most appealing features is a two-story colonnade supported by monumental Tuscan columns. The colonnade faces the courtyard and supports the loggia on the first and second stories, while simple, square piers support the third-level loggia. Wrought-iron balusters are located on the first and second floors on portions of the colonnade. Decorative elements within the courtyard, including colorful mosaic tiles and urns, emphasize the Mediterranean Renaissance Revival style of the building, which blends classical and exotic motifs. Wrought-iron light fixtures are located on the building, and a wrought-iron grille with a gilded eagle tops the entrance to the postal lobby. The exterior is divided into horizontal zones by water tables and stringcourses, a feature common to Renaissance Revival architecture. Classically inspired limestone surrounds highlight prominent features, such as windows and entrances, on the wings. Another colonnade (now enclosed with operable windows) is located on the rear. The penthouse contains a clerestory band of windows, that admits light into the third story. Five skylights, including one on the penthouse roof, illuminate the interior. The roof is covered with green glazed tiles. The majority of interior spaces open onto the loggias, which provide necessary air circulation. The original postal service spaces on the first level contain gray-veined, white marble floors. Walls and ceilings are covered with painted plaster. Changes to the interior integrated new technology and accommodated changing uses of the building. Elevators have been added over time, including the island's first passenger elevator in 1950. After the courts vacated the building in 1978, the courtroom was transformed into office space. Total floor area is . Although landscaping was designed as part of initial construction, much of the plan was not executed until the wings were built. The grounds are lushly planted with numerous native plants with retaining walls of indigenous lava stone. On Memorial Day in 1922, the American Legion planted 17 royal palms along Kekaulike Street to commemorate Hawaiian citizens who died in World War I.

It was designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and completed in 1964. The building is tall with 30 floors; it was named for U.S. Congressman Everett Dirksen. The building houses the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the United States Bankruptcy Court, the United States Marshal for the Northern District of Illinois, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, and local offices for various court-related federal agencies, such as the Federal Public Defender, United States Probation Service, United States Trustee, and National Labor Relations Board. It is one of three buildings making up the modernist Federal Plaza complex designed by van der Rohe, along with the U.S. Post Office (Loop Station) and the Kluczynski Federal Building. Separate from the Federal Plaza, but opposite the Kluczynski Building across Jackson Boulevard, is the Metcalfe Federal Building. History In 1960, Congress authorized the U.S. General Services Administration to construct a new office complex in Chicago's Loop District. The Federal Center consolidated over thirty agencies formerly scattered throughout the city in substandard leased space. Four Chicago architectural firms joined forces for the commission. The world-renowned architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe served as the chief designer with Schmidt, Garden and Erikson; C. F. Murphy Associates; and A. Epstein and Sons all working on the project. The original plan for the Chicago Federal Center called for two towers, the first to house federal agencies including the U.S. Department of the Treasury and U.S. Department of Defense, and the second for the courts, U.S. Department of Justice, and U.S. Postal Service. However, vehicular access for the post office required a street-level loading dock that would have intruded on the openness of the plaza between the two buildings. Upon further study, Mies designed a separate post office building with its own, below-grade vehicular access. The site for the new Federal Center included the block occupied by the Beaux-Arts style U.S. Post Office and Courthouse (1898‚Äì1905) designed by Henry Ives Cobb, which replaced an 1879 government building in the same location. It was in Cobb's domed building where Al Capone was tried for tax evasion in 1931. Tenants occupied the new U.S. Courthouse, the first of the complex's three buildings to be completed, in 1964. The government began demolition of the old post office in 1965 to clear the site for the two remaining buildings. The Loop Station Post Office and new Federal Building were completed in 1973 and 1974 respectively. The courthouse was renamed for Everett Dirksen to honor the longtime Illinois Senator after his death in 1969. The Federal Building was renamed in 1975 to honor John C. Kluczynski, U.S. Representative from Illinois from 1951 until his death in 1975. The Post Office remains unnamed for an individual, but features a large bust and monument to 19th century Chicago Post Office manager George B. Armstrong, the founder and original superintendent of the Railway Mail Service. Architecture Dirksen Building detail US Post Office Loop Station at the Dirksen Building. Photo by Carol M. Highsmith The Federal Center extends over two blocks; a one-block site, bounded by Jackson, Clark, Adams, and Dearborn streets, contains the John C. Kluczynski Federal Building and U.S. Post Office Loop Station, while a parcel on an adjacent block to the east contains the courthouse. A glass-enclosed great hall, wide and high, spans the center of the courthouse, serving as a visual gateway through the complex. From State Street on the east, one can look west down Quincy Street, through the courthouse, across Dearborn Street to the central plaza and post office beyond. To its northwest is the freestanding Loop Station post office, which is one story with two workroom levels below grade. Directly across the street from the Kluczynski building is the thirty-story Everett M. Dirksen U.S. Courthouse. The courthouse contains 1.4 million gross square feet of space and is set at a right angle to the Federal Building high-rise across Dearborn Street. The Dirksen courthouse was designed with fifteen, two-story courtrooms located on the top ten stories of the building. Courtrooms were located away from the curtain walls to reduce audio and visual distractions. The simple but elegant book-matched black-walnut paneling and molded-plywood spectator benches are lit by ceiling fixtures covered with an aluminum grid. During the 1990s, additional courtrooms were created within the building in a style complementing the original details; Mies's initial design planned for future expansion of this nature. The simple and well-proportioned steel-and-glass design of the Chicago Federal Center epitomizes the minimalist architectural approach favored by architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The structural framing of the buildings is formed of high-tensile bolted steel and concrete. The exterior curtain walls are defined by projecting steel I-beam mullions covered with flat black graphite paint, characteristic of Mies's designs. The balance of the curtain walls are of bronze-tinted glass panes, framed in shiny aluminum, and separated by steel spandrels, also covered with flat black graphite paint. This organization emphasizes the impressive height of the sleek towers. Franz Schulze, a scholar of Mies's work, has praised \\"Mies's uncompromising devotion to principle, together with his vaunted sensitivity to proportion and structural detail and the organizational scale, [that] combine to give the complex a monumental urban presence.\\" The entire complex is organized on a 28-foot grid pattern subdivided into six 4-foot, 8-inch modules. This pattern extends from the granite-paved plaza into the ground- floor lobbies of the two towers, where the floors and elevator lobby walls are also granite. The lines of the grid continue vertically up the buildings, integrating each component of the complex. The 42-story, John C. Kluczynski Federal Building is the tallest of the three buildings. Both the Kluczynski and Dirksen buildings are elevated on open colonnades, called pilotis, at the plaza level. In the early 1970s, the U.S. General Services Administration, under its Art in Architecture program, commissioned a steel sculpture for the plaza from the celebrated artist Alexander Calder. His creation, entitled Flamingo, was unveiled on October 25, 1974. The 53-foot-tall steel stabile, with its bright red color and graceful curves, provides a striking contrast to the dark, angular steel and glass curtain walls of the Federal Center buildings. In 1998, the stabile was conserved and lighting was added. In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, Chicago Federal Plaza was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois).

It is a distinguished example of Beaux-Arts architecture, and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Constructed from 1902 to 1905, the United States District Court for the District of Indiana met here until it was subdivided in 1928; the United States Circuit Court for the District of Indiana met here until that court was abolished in 1912. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as \\"U.S. Courthouse and Post Office\\" in 1974. The courthouse was renamed in honor of Senator Birch Bayh in 2003. Building history The building was one of only 35 federal buildings constructed under the Tarsney Act of 1893. The United States Treasury Department sought designs for the new federal building from private architectural firms through an open competition allowed under the Act. John Hall Rankin and Thomas Kellogg, noted Philadelphia architects, secured the design contract, and the Treasury Department accepted the New York-based John Pierce Company's low construction bid of $1,300,000. (The final cost, however, reached nearly $2,000,000.) Begun in 1902 and completed in 1905, the new federal building was massive. Accommodating 925 federal employees, the U-shaped, Beaux Arts structure occupied an entire block, rose four stories, and housed federal courts, offices, and the main post office. Beaux Arts classicism, often reflected in federal buildings of this era, was popularized by the majestic buildings of the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. Monumental design and formal planning of spaces are hallmarks of the style. The Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse inspired Beaux Arts designs for other public buildings in Indianapolis, including Indianapolis City Hall (1910), the Indianapolis Public Library (1917), and buildings in the Indiana World War Memorial Plaza (dedicated in 1927). Architecture Completed in 1905, the building is an example of Beaux-Arts architecture, a popular style of its time.

Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs Completed in 1905, the new federal building was originally U-shaped. The symmetrical facade features evenly spaced Ionic pilasters and terraces with stone balusters. A heavy classical cornice tops the building. A five-story addition, completed in 1938, enclosed the original U-shaped plan, creating an interior courtyard. The addition is compatible with the original building, featuring classical ornamentation mixed with modern details such as the stylized relief over the entrances. The original impressive scale and richly ornamented interior design elements remain intact. Mosaic tile ceilings, cantilevered marble staircases, and much of the original decorative artwork and furnishings are still in place. The major interior spaces of the building are the first-floor lobbies and connecting corridor and the original courtrooms at the southeast and southwest corners of the second floor. The exterior entry doors at the southeast and southwest corners of the first floor open into barrel-vaulted corridors with white marble walls and brown and green marble pilasters and columns. The corridors lead to vaulted octagonal vestibules that feature red marble walls and gray Tuscan columns, as well as Roman-style mosaics on the ceilings. Arched openings of the octagonal vestibules lead to lobbies with elevators and grand staircases, and to the quadripart vaulted connecting corridor. The semicircular marble staircases are among the finest examples of cantilevered (supported only from one end) stone stairs in the United States. Among the most impressive interior features of the building are the Depression-era murals. Working under the Treasury Relief Art Project, which aimed to restore faith in the country through patriotic and historically themed art, master artist Grant Christian painted murals that depict the history of transportation and delivery of mail in Indianapolis. Christian was paid $1.55 per hour while his assistant, Reynolds Selfridge receive half that much.Carlise, John C, and Darryl Jones, photography, ‚Äò‚Äô A Simple and Vital Design: The Story of the Indiana Post Office Murals‚Äô‚Äô Indiana Historical Society, Indianapolis, Indiana, 1995 pp. 47-48 The courtrooms feature handsome marble floors, colored marble and plaster wall finishes, and elaborately ornamented, gilded, and painted plaster beam and panel ceilings with skylights.

Depression-era interior modifications were mostly cosmetic in nature. These included replacement of open metal grillwork doors on the elevators with polished metal doors, and installation of dark green marble- faced walls at elevator entrances. Modern translucent panels replaced the original stained-glass skylights in the second-floor courtrooms. The first- floor east-west corridor is no longer used as a post office. The postal service windows and mailboxes were removed when these functions were shifted to widely dispersed annexes. Replicas of the service windows were added during the course of restoration, returning the space to its original appearance. In recent years, the General Services Administration (GSA) has reversed some past modifications made in the name of modernization, and has begun conserving important elements of the building. GSA has replaced modern lighting with appropriate period features, repaired mosaic tile ceilings, and restored exterior stone work.

Ross Adair Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse is a historic post office, courthouse, and federal office building located at Fort Wayne in Allen County, Indiana. The building is a courthouse of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006 as U.S. Post Office and Courthouse. Building history Fort Wayne historically served as a transportation and communication center located at the confluence of the St. Marys and St. Joseph rivers, which meet to form the Maumee River. In the 1840s, the Wabash and Erie Canal opened in Fort Wayne, and the town became a bustling business center. The population continued to increase when the arrival of the railroad boosted industrial growth. By the 1920s, Fort Wayne was an important city in the Midwest and consequently required federal services. Officials planned for a post office, federal office building, and federal courthouse. In 1928, Congress authorized funds for the acquisition of a site through the Public Buildings Act of 1926, which appropriated resources for federal buildings throughout the United States. Congress earmarked additional funds for construction through the same legislation. Federal officials retained private architects Guy Mahurin, who was from Fort Wayne, and Benjamin Morris, a New Yorker. The building was designed under the auspices of James A. Wetmore, acting supervising architect of the U.S. Treasury Department. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs Excavation for the new building was completed in 1931. Many contracting firms submitted construction bids. Fortunately, the bids were lower than federal officials anticipated, which allowed impressive design features such as the entry plaza and marble floors to be incorporated into the project budget. Ralph Sollitt and Sons of South Bend, Indiana, constructed the building. The building has a structural system of reinforced concrete and was one of the first large federal buildings to use this method rather than a steel frame. The reinforced concrete technique saved $30,000. Construction was completed in 1932, with an opening ceremony held on October 29 of that year. In 2000, the building was named to honor E. Ross Adair, a Republican congressman from Indiana's Fourth District. Adair, who was born in Fort Wayne in 1907 and died there in 1983, served in the U.S. Army during World War II and was ambassador to Ethiopia from 1971-1974. He was in private legal practice at the time of his death. The post office vacated the building in 1987. Currently, it houses the U.S. District Court, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, and other federal offices. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2006 as U.S. Post Office and Courthouse. Architecture Closeup of the courthouse The E. Ross Adair Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse occupies a parcel of land bounded by Douglas Avenue and Harrison, Brackenridge, and Webster streets. It is designed in the Stripped Classical style of architecture, which was frequently used for federal building design during the Depression era and was advocated by Louis A. Simon, who oversaw federal building design under Acting Supervising Architect James A. Wetmore. It features classically inspired symmetry, massing, and materials, but without the abundant ornamentation that was common on some earlier styles of federal architecture. Instead, its stylized decorative elements are characteristic of those found in Art Deco architecture. The imposing building portrayed the dignity and stability of the federal presence during a difficult time in American history. The building rises three stories above a basement and is clad in gray-buff limestone with a granite base and entrance steps. Replacement aluminum sash windows are found throughout the building. The facade faces east toward the entry plaza and Harrison Street. The bays are divided by classically inspired columns with carved capitals in a stylized leaf pattern reminiscent of Corinthian columns. Eagle motifs are found on metal spandrel panels that separate the first and second floors; limestone panels with simple medallions separate the second and third levels. The building is topped by a cornice that contains the gutter system and features carved lion heads at evenly spaced intervals. Projecting pavilions at each end of the facade contain entrances that are topped by original cast-aluminum grilles. The door openings have stone surrounds with carved cornices containing stylized floral and leaf patterns. Carved stone medallions containing eagle motifs are located above each entrance. The interior contains several significant spaces that retain their historic finishes and features and continue to convey the grandeur of the building. The entry vestibules have floors covered in contrasting marble that forms a central star design with a diamond-shaped border. Walls are also clad in marble with molded door and window surrounds and fluted pilasters. Built-in marble benches are below windows. The pale marble is St. Genevieve Golden Vein and the darker marble is Verde Antique. Elaborate plaster coffered ceilings glazed a rich golden brown top the space. The postal lobby on the first floor features marble floors, marble walls, decorative plaster ceilings, and ornamental cast-aluminum door and window surrounds. Although postal services are no longer located in the building, original postal window openings with cast aluminum surrounds and marble sills remain. Above the postal windows are large transom windows with leaded glass. The district courtroom on the second floor is another important space. Its walls have dark green marble bases below mahogany wall panels with walnut burl inlay. Ornate bronze grilles and wall sconces are original features. The ornamental plaster cornice transitions into a plaster coffered ceiling with alternating octagonal and square designs that have been painted in a polychromatic color scheme. One of the most impressive features of the site is the elaborate plaza along the Harrison Street facade. The plaza is reached by granite steps that contain a landing with a flagpole with a simply decorated bronze base. Integral granite benches form walls that enclose the plaza. The rear plaza bench, which is 40 feet long, is carved with the signs of the zodiac on the back while the arms have carved stylized leaf motifs.

Completed in 1934, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. It is a contributing resource within the Cathedral Historic District. Building history As Dubuque expanded during the 1920s, the post office was not large enough to handle the increasing volume of mail. Rather than enlarge the existing building, city officials decided to construct a new post office. Congressman Thomas J. B. Robinson led the effort to secure a more appropriate postal facility. Officials determined that the new building would function as both a post office and courthouse, and the building continues to serve these purposes today.General Services Administration page on the United States Post Office and Courthouse (Dubuque, Iowa). The building was constructed with funding from the 1926 Public Buildings Act, in which Congress appropriated substantial resources for Federal buildings throughout the United States. Dubuque received approximately $650,000 for site acquisition and construction costs. Renowned city planner John Nolen intended for the building to be part of his civic design, \\"Administrative Center at Washington Park,\\" which he developed in 1931. City officials hoped to construct a city hall, courthouse, and park adjacent to the post office, but these plans were never realized. The Courthouse was designed by the Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore, who received input from Iowa architects. Among the local designers was the office of Proudfoot, Rawson, Souers & Thomas, a highly respected Des Moines firm. This venerable firm (including earlier variations of the founding office) had a long of history of designing high-profile public buildings in Iowa, including the Polk County Courthouse in Des Moines and buildings for Iowa State University and the University of Iowa. Although little is known about the Dubuque architect involved in the project, Herbert Kennison, he likely served as an onsite consultant and provided the valued contribution of a designer who was also a local resident. The building's cornerstone was laid in 1932, and a dedication ceremony was held the following year. The building was occupied in early 1934. In 1985, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing resource within the Cathedral Historic District, which encompasses historically significant residences and public buildings. Architecture The United States Post Office and Courthouse is located in the heart of the business district in downtown Dubuque, Iowa, and fronts Washington Park. Construction commenced in 1932 and was completed in 1934. The building, which was designed in the Art Deco style, displays the strong rectilinear qualities that influenced Modern architecture in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s. The building has a form that is similar to public architecture of earlier periods, but most of the elaborate ornamentation found on buildings from previous eras was omitted. The result is clean and restrained, yet still monumental. Many civic buildings constructed during the Great Depression display this reserved quality. The building consists of a centrally placed, projecting, four-story tower flanked by three-story wings. The tower was originally designed to accommodate an observation room for the local weather bureau. The exterior is clad in cream-colored Bedford limestone cut into ashlar (squared and smooth) blocks. Decorative details that are consistent with typical Art Deco ornamentation are found on the building. These include stylized flowers, swags, dentils (rectangular blocks), and chevron (V-shaped) elements. The corners of the tower are chamfered with a 45-degree bevel cut and contain stylized eagle motifs that express the Federal government's presence in Dubuque. The tall, vertical windows are evenly spaced and have bronze mullions, which are common on Art Deco architecture. The windows are separated by fluted pilasters (attached columns) that add to the classical appeal of the building's design. The interior features several important murals in the lobby vestibule. The murals were funded with $2,000 of the original money allotted for construction of the building. Although a competition to select an artist was held, officials intended to select Grant Wood, the famous Iowa painter of \\"American Gothic,\\" to complete the murals. When Wood did not enter the competition, William E. L. Bunn was selected. The selection was subsequently overturned in favor of a painter named Bertrand Adams. As a compromise, both Bunn and Adams, who each studied and worked with Wood and were friends from the University of Iowa, were allowed to paint murals. Adams painted \\"Early Settlers of Dubuque\\" in 1936 and 1937. The painting depicts several symbols of the city's pioneering days, such as the Julien Dubuque Monument and the Mesquakie Native American village. Adams also represented impending industrialization by painting the Dubuque Shot Tower and a bridge. Bunn painted \\"Early Mississippi Packet 'Dubuque III'\\" (also referred to as \\"Early Mississippi Steamboats\\") at the same time. His mural illustrates life in Dubuque in 1870, when steamboats were a primary method of transportation in the Midwest. The two murals show a harmony of scale and color use. The lobby is also decorated with American walnut veneer panels topped by an ornamental cornice with designs of leaves and circles. Bronze grilles with geometric patterns are a typical Art Deco feature. The main staircase on the north end of the building is richly finished with rose-gray marble wainscot, stairs, and landings. The brushed aluminum railing adds a strong Art Deco character to the space. The courtroom is located on the second floor. Cardiff green marble encircles the base of the room. American walnut paneling is laid in a herringbone pattern and topped with a scalloped band of wood. The scalloped motif is repeated in metal grilles and furniture.

It has historically housed a post office, courthouse, and other offices of the United States government. The building now serves only as a federal courthouse, housing operations of the eastern division of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. In 2018, the operations of the Rock Island division of the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois were also moved there. Building history Predecessor building The U.S. Post Office which previously sat at the location of the current building. Part of the site occupied by the courthouse was previously the site of an 1891 post office, completed in 1896 under the supervision of architect Willoughby J. Edbrooke.Historic Federal Courthouses page for the Davenport, Iowa, U.S. Post Office, from the Federal Judicial Center. The 1891 building also became home to an office of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa in 1904. A wing added in 1909 did little to alleviate the crowding in the building. The city experienced an economic boom during the 1920s that lasted into the early 1930s. The construction of high- rise buildings downtown, including hotels and department stores, spurred the need for a new building to house the post office and federal courts. By 1932, the Great Depression had put many people out of work. Federal projects, including construction of a lock and dam, improvements to the seawall, and road construction provided employment for Davenport residents. In 1930, Congress appropriated $655,000 for the construction of a new federal building on the site of the 1891 building, plus the purchase of two adjacent parcels. Demolition of the early post office and courthouse took place in April 1932. Construction Exterior detail Construction of the new building took just over 500 days. Local architect Seth J. Temple designed the building, which was commissioned by the Office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury. Temple studied at the American Academy in Rome and the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and taught at the University of Illinois School of Architecture in Urbana. Other Davenport buildings that Temple designed include Davenport Hall, the Union Bank and Office building, and the Blackhawk and Burlington hotels. The building was completed for approximately $500,000, which was significantly less than the original appropriation, and city residents and officials gathered for a dedication ceremony on October 15, 1933. Constructed as a post office and courthouse, the building retained both of those functions until about 1965. The post office moved out of the building at that time and the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) acquired the building. The building was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. In 2020 it was included as a contributing property in the Davenport Downtown Commercial Historic District. Architecture First-floor lobby The U.S. Courthouse is a skillfully executed example of Depression-era architecture that invokes the Art Deco style. The three-story building is essentially rectangular, though a portion of the building near the rear has only one story. The building has a steel frame and integral concrete beam floors, with cladding that includes a coursed granite base and Minnesota Kasota travertine limestone on the north, east, and west elevations. The cladding of the south elevation is buff-colored brick laid in a Flemish bond pattern. The building has a flat composite roof with a parapet. The main entry is in the north elevation, which is the most elaborate. The entablature above the third story windows projects slightly from the vertical surface of the building, set off by a limestone stringcourse. A decorative parapet at the top of the building features a carved limestone frieze with a stylized Ionic order capital and shield design. The elevation is nine bays wide. The second and eighth bays feature ground floor entrance doors, each with dark gray granite surrounds. Immediately above the doors are circular limestone panels featuring stylized carved eagles. Pairs of bronze light stanchions with granite bases flank each door, each with an embossed chevron and geometric designs. The door surrounds feature stylized carvings that imitate Beaux-Arts style classical pilasters. Embossed bronze spandrels separate the second and third story windows. Second- floor courtroom The most significant interior space is the two-story courtroom that occupies the central portion of the second floor, and its adjacent judges' chambers, library, and restroom. Flat geometric patterns and chevron designs reflect the architectural details of the building's exterior, as do the fluted classical pilasters. The interior of the east doors, which provide the main entry to the courtroom, are covered with leather and trimmed with metal studs. A base of rouge marble rings the room. The laurel paneling is laid in a herringbone pattern. The wood grain of the wainscoting is vertically oriented. The cornice frieze, carved to depict chevrons and stylized leaves, is black walnut. Black walnut insets depicting leaves and berries are located above the doors on the west side of the room. Some of the furnishings are original. Additional original interior details that remain include the flooring, some of which are terrazzo floors and others are marble. The wainscoting, cladding in bathrooms and vestibules, door surrounds in the vestibules and the first floor elevator lobby, stairway treads, and hallway baseboards are original marble. Some lighting fixtures in the stairwells and hallways are also original. Metal grill in the second-floor courtroom After the first renovation in the 1960s, which converted the former postal facilities into offices, there were additional renovations during the 1970s and 1990s. Between 2003 and 2005, the building was renovated under GSA's Design Excellence program, which provides design assistance to high-quality public buildings by stressing creativity and providing design feedback from peers. The project, which converted the building to a dedicated courthouse facility, included the construction of two new courtrooms, restoration of the historic courtroom, and renovation of the first-floor lobby. In 2006, The Spirit of Law and Iowa Reports, paintings created by artist Xiaoze Xie under the auspices of GSA's Art in Architecture program, were installed in the Davenport Courthouse. The artist hoped that the paintings, installed in the jury assembly room, would \\"prompt visitors to consider the connections between history and the present and between ideas and realities.\\" History *1891: Construction of original post office at this location *1932-1933: Construction of current building on site *1965: GSA acquires building after Post Office vacates building; first floor renovated *1972, 1977, 1997: Additional alterations to building *2005: Listed in National Register of Historic Places *2005: Completion of building modernization under GSA's Design Excellence program *2006: The Spirit of Law and Iowa Reports installed in jury assembly room Building facts Main entrance *Location: 131 East Fourth Street *Architect: Seth J.

It was recorded by the Original Dixieland Jass Band on February 26, 1917, and, with the A side \\"Dixieland Jass Band One-Step\\" or \\"Dixie Jass Band One-Step\\" (a tune later better known as \\"Original Dixieland One-Step\\"), became widely acknowledged as the first jazz recording commercially released. It was recorded by the Victor Talking Machine Company in New York City at its studio at 46 West 38th Street on the 12th floor ‚Äì the top floor. History The sheet music cover for the ODJB version under the alternate title \\"Barnyard Blues\\", Leo Feist, Inc., New York, copyright 1917. 1917 Ray Lopez and Alcide Nunez version sheet music cover, artwork by Grim Natwick. Roger Graham Music Publisher, Chicago. The Original Dixieland Jass Band was a group of white musicians from New Orleans. They had gained popularity playing at Schiller's Cafe in Chicago and Reisenweber's Restaurant in New York City, and became largely responsible for making the New Orleans style popular on a national level. The ODJB made test recordings for Columbia on January 30, 1917, but no usable recordings resulted. On February 26 the ODJB recorded \\"Livery Stable Blues\\" for the Victor label. \\"Dixieland Jass Band One-Step\\" was recorded in the same session. Victor executives quickly released the record, which became an instant hit. The success of this recording has been cited as possibly being the first popular music release to sell a million copies. However, the production- history cards for the record in Victor company files indicate that only some 250,983 copies were manufactured. The record established jazz as popular music and spawned demand for small jazz bands in New York and Chicago, at a time when it was getting harder and harder for musicians to find employment in New Orleans. Both sides of the record were originally labeled as compositions by members of the band. However, two other New Orleans musicians, Nunez and Lopez, beat the ODJB in registering a copyright on the tune. Alcide Nunez had been clarinetist with the ODJB until a few months earlier. Trumpeter Ray Lopez had worked with most of the ODJB musicians in New Orleans, especially in the bands of Papa Jack Laine. The members of the ODJB published the piece copyrighted as their own composition under the alternative title \\"Barnyard Blues\\". The two parties and their respective publishers sued each other. The case resulted in the judge declaring neither party had copyright over the work, that it was based on a pre-existing melody, and declared it to be in the \\"public domain\\". The judge also expressed doubt that musicians unable to read or write music could be said to have \\"composed\\" anything. Meanwhile, a second lawsuit arose from one of the strains of \\"Dixieland Jass Band One-Step\\" being almost identical to the 1909 Joe Jordan number \\"That Teasin' Rag\\". Later pressings of the record added Jordan as co-composer and he was awarded a share of the royalties. Later pressings of \\"Livery Stable Blues\\" omitted the phrase \\"Composed and played by\\" from the original pressings. After Victor's release became a hit, Columbia had the group back to record again, and released their recording of \\"Home Again in Indiana\\" backed by \\"At the Darktown Strutters Ball\\". Columbia selected two Tin Pan Alley tunes of the day for the band to record, probably to avoid the copyright problems which surfaced over both sides of the band's supposed original compositions for Victor. The Original Dixieland Jass Band published the sheet music for the composition under the alternate title of \\"Barnyard Blues\\" with Leo Feist in New York listing Nick LaRocca as the composer. The sheet music cover contained a reference to the Victor release of \\"Livery Stable Blues\\", 18255: \\"As recorded on Victor Record No. 18255 under the title of 'Livery Stable Blues'. Jazz Fox Trot by D.J. LaRocca.\\"Barnyard Blues. Howard-Tilton Memorial Library, Tulane University. Alcide Nunez and Ray Lopez published sheet music with Roger A. Graham (1885‚Äì1938) in Chicago listing themselves as the composers. On their rival sheet music cover they refer to the same Victor release, Victor Record No. 18255. In a second issue of the sheet music, Marvin Lee added lyrics to the Nunez and Lopez version. Composition Musically, \\"Livery Stable Blues\\" is a New Orleans style twelve-bar blues. It starts with a four-bar introduction, followed by three distinct themes played in succession, each repeated twice. The third theme consists of the trombone, clarinet and cornet imitating various barnyard animals: the clarinet a rooster, the cornet a horse, and the trombone a cow. The three themes are then repeated, and the tune ends with a one-bar tag. Lyrics were added to the instrumental by Marvin Lee. Personnel * Nick LaRocca ‚Äî cornet * Eddie Edwards ‚Äî trombone * Larry Shields ‚Äî clarinet * Henry Ragas ‚Äî piano * Tony Spargo ‚Äî drums Later recordings W.C. Handy recorded one of the earliest cover versions of \\"Livery Stable Blues\\" on Columbia Records in New York on September 25, 1917 under the name Handy's Orchestra of Memphis, as A2419, with \\"That 'Jazz' Dance\\" as the flip side. Paul Whiteman opened his landmark concert An Experiment in Modern Music in Aeolian Hall, New York City, on February 12, 1924 with the tune, to demonstrate the sound of early jazz bands. Jelly Roll Morton, the Emerson Military Band, the New Orleans Rhythm Kings, Fletcher Henderson, Benny Goodman, Glen Gray and the Casa Loma Orchestra, Bunny Berigan, Muggsy Spanier, Pete Daily and his Chicagoans, Phil Napoleon, the Belgrade Dixieland Orchestra, and Vince Giordano, on the 2011 Grammy Award-winning soundtrack album to the HBO Boardwalk Empire series, have also recorded the song.

It is a courthouse for the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. Building history The U.S. Courthouse in Wichita, originally the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse, is distinguished by its modern facade and Depression-era murals. The building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as part of a group of Kansas Post Offices noted for their artwork. The U.S. Courthouse demonstrates a skillful blending of Art Deco and classical influences; it retains the symmetry and proportions of Classical architecture while modernizing exterior ornamentation. It is representative of the large and cohesive body of architectural work by Louis A. Simon, who was responsible for the design of government buildings at the Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore. The building was constructed between August 1930 and April 1932 at a cost of $1.2 million. As a courthouse and post office, the building was significant in the development of the city of Wichita. From the time of the earliest settlement, the Wichita Post Office was a focal point of the community, and when the location of the post office shifted, the downtown commercial area grew up around it. When the site for the new U.S. Courthouse, which was to include the new post office, was selected at 401 North Market Street, it was only a few blocks from the site of Wichita's original post office in the Durfee Ranch Store. The new building provided an anchor for development and helped draw businesses north along Main Street from Douglas Avenue. Architecture Modernistic for its time, the U.S. Courthouse is a U-shaped, flat-roofed, steel-framed building clad in beige Bedford limestone. The building is 224 feet by 157 feet, and is three levels in height, with a fourth level across the south elevation, and a fifth level at the towers of the east and west corners. While the receding walls of the towers stress the vertical, the long facades of the building express an overall horizontal emphasis. All windows are in slightly recessed planes, with pilasters between openings. The even fenestration pattern and the rusticated first story of the building are common themes in classically inspired architecture. The main entrances in the towers on the south elevation have heavy molded surrounds, ornamental reveals, and shelf heads. Above the shelf are two winged limestone lions holding a plaque. Stone carving on the exterior-primarily around the entrances and near the tops of the towers- combines classically inspired, Art Deco, and regional motifs such as winged lions, eagles, buffalo, Native Americans, wheat, and ears of corn. The latter symbols reflect Wichita's cultural and historic heritage. An ornamental band with a stylized, winged-bird motif is centered between the window heads and the cornice line. Styles displayed on the exterior are continued throughout the interior of the building, where regional motifs blend with classicism. The entrances in the towers on the south elevation open into marble-clad vestibules. The interior doors are hollow bronze set in a wrought-bronze and glass-panel framework. A cast-bronze cornice with four bronze eagles tops the entire framework. The plaster ceiling is coffered with egg-and-dart molding and a star pattern inside the coffers. The walls of the primary corridors on the second level are clad in Kasota Cream marble. Two pairs of double walnut- panel doors with oval windows open into the District Courtroom. The coffered ceilings feature ornamental plaster work, and the elaborate cornice is also plaster. The exterior of the U.S. Courthouse retains its original appearance. The most impressive interior spaces with grand materials remain intact; these include the lobbies, corridors, and courtrooms. When the Postal Service moved out in 1986, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) restored the finishes of the main lobby and transformed the postal workroom with its wood block floor and warehouse appearance into two courtrooms. Original marble was painstakingly matched and the original paint colors were recreated. Light fixtures, wood paneling and judges' benches were accurately replicated using historic documentation. GSA undertook additional renovations in 1998. Oil-on- canvas murals, painted in 1935-1936, are located on the east and west walls of the lobby. Artists J. Ward Lockwood and Richard Haines received the commissions through a post office mural project awarded by the U.S. Treasury Department's Painting and Sculpture Section. \\"Pioneers in Kansas,\\" the mural by Lockwood (a Kansas native), is a collage of images associated with role and evolution of the Postal Service during the settlement of the western United States. A stagecoach laden with mail and passengers marks the center of the canvas, with the other images radiating around it. A Pony Express rider and a Native American exchange fire on the left side of the canvas. A vulture flies above the rider, symbolizing imminent danger and death. A pioneer couple stands on the right side of the canvas, the woman reading a letter. A black steam engine emerges behind the couple, symbolizing continued western expansion. \\"Kansas Farming,\\" the mural by Haines, depicts various aspects of rural life and farm production, focusing on the importance of urbanization, industrialization, and technology to the economic growth of the region. Rolling hills ripe with the bounty of the fall harvest comprise the idealized rural landscape. Tall corn and sunflower plants frame the center panel of the canvas, in which a farmer on horseback visits his neighbors. Nearby, a young girl holds mail in both hands as the boy waves to an unseen mail plane. A farmer feeds corn to his hogs and looks toward a group of produce packers on the left side of the canvas. In the distant background, a small town with a railroad depot and grain elevator represent the growing role of industry in agriculture.

For his own instrument, he composed a cello concerto and Three Pieces for Solo Cello. He has written string quartets and compositions which juxtapose a quartet with a solo instrument, including Piccolo Quintet, Bassoon Quintet and Rhapsodie Macabre. He has set poetry for speaking voice and cello, such as Der Handschuh, and has composed song cycles. His compositions reflect the individual capacity and character of players and instruments, from piccolo to contrabassoon. Since 1998, Waterhouse has organised a concert series at the Gasteig in Munich, often playing with members of the Munich Philharmonic. His works have been performed internationally and were recorded. He has been awarded prizes for several of his compositions, and has been composer in residence at institutions in several European countries.

He established in 1998 a regular chamber music concert series at Gasteig Munich, programming contemporary works alongside classical repertory. Players for his chamber music concerts have included members of the Munich Philharmonic, such as bassoonist Lyndon Watts. Waterhouse has collaborated with the composers Jens Josef (flute) and Rudi Spring (piano). They appeared together in a trio concert at the Gasteig, performing Martin≈Ø's trio, the premiere of the flute version of Gestural Variations, and a Christmas carol by each composer, ' set by Waterhouse. The song ' (The Mountain) on a poem of Hans Krieger for mezzo-soprano, alto flute, cello and piano, was premiered at the Gasteig in 2010 by Martina Koppelstetter, Jens Josef, the composer and Christopher White.

Gignoux U.S. Courthouse is a historic courthouse building at 156 Federal Street in Portland, Maine. It is the courthouse for the United States District Court for the District of Maine. Building history When it was completed in 1911, the U.S. Courthouse in Portland, now known as the Edward T. Gignoux U.S. Courthouse, was the first federal courthouse in Maine. Its national stature combined with its distinctive Italian Renaissance Revival architecture brought prestige to Portland's civic center. Designed by James Knox Taylor, Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury Department, the courthouse's classical details complement its neighbors surrounding Lincoln Park, which include the U.S. Custom House (1872), Cumberland County Courthouse (1910), and Portland City Hall (1912). The U.S. Courthouse was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Construction of the U.S. Post Office Building near Lincoln Park in 1868 helped establish the area as a location for public buildings at the turn of the twentieth century. By 1908, the federal government had acquired a prominent site for a new courthouse adjacent to the park, and construction began that year. Knox designed a trapezoidal building with an interior courtyard to be constructed in two phases. The U-shaped first phase of construction was completed in 1911. In 1931‚Äì32, Knox's original design was completed, closing the U, under the direction of the Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore. The new construction provided space for a post office and additional offices on the upper floors. In 1988, the U.S. Courthouse was renamed in honor of Judge Edward T. Gignoux, a veteran of 26 years on the bench, who had gained notoriety when he presided over the contempt trial of activists who attempted to disrupt the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968. In 1996, the courthouse underwent extensive modernization, which added two new courtrooms in the 1931-32 addition. The principal features and details of the first and second floors of the 1911 construction were rehabilitated and restored. As a result of the project, the Edward T. Gignoux U.S. Courthouse was awarded an Institutional Preservation Award from Greater Portland Landmarks in 1999. Architecture The Edward T. Gignoux U.S. Courthouse's Italian Renaissance Revival style reflects its architect's belief that classicism was well suited for federal buildings. Entirely faced with New England granite, the building is composed of two stories above a raised stone base. Each level is articulated on the exterior through the use of subtle variations in ornamentation and textures. The first story is characterized by channeled stone. It is distinguished from the second story by a stringcourse and by the second story's smooth masonry. Differentiation also occurs in the fenestration. While the first floor has recessed, rectangular windows with simple moldings, the second-story windows are larger and elaborately detailed with classical moldings, balcony balustrades, and crowning triangular and segmented pediments, some of which are set within large arched niches with keystones. A continuous frieze, dentil molding, and cornice finish the top of the wall, where a parapet caps the composition. A succession of circular dormer windows punctuates the attic story of the slate-shingled mansard roof. The exterior articulation and ornamentation of the 1931-32 addition faithfully replicates the architectural detail of the original 1911 construction. The building's trapezoidal plan occupies an entire city block bounded by Federal, Newbury, Pearl, and Market Streets. The building's original U-shaped plan comprises the southwest portion of the block, with the 1931-32 addition completing the northeast side and enclosing the central courtyard. The courtyard is accessed through a porte-cochere on Federal Street, and features buff-colored brick walls with granite stringcourses and keystones for the walls. The building's formal entrance, located at the angled corner at Federal and Market Streets, is marked by a large, triangular pediment that surmounts a Doric frieze and engaged columns decorated with banded rustication. The entrance leads into the elliptical Rotunda, an elegant and open two-story foyer with refined classical detailing. The Rotunda features a curving marble staircase with a balustrade of thin cast-iron balusters, rising to the second floor along the perimeter of the room. The elegant public spaces are symmetrically composed using classical proportions and details for the bases, wainscoting, and crown molding. Stained wood finishes, such as oak and pine, are used in the courtrooms, corridors, and judicial chambers. Marble finishes and terrazzo floors are reserved for the courtrooms and the corridors in the first floor. Interior finishes in the 1931-32 addition reveal the reduced or ‚Äî stripped ‚Äî classical style of the era, as seen in the abstracted designs in the terrazzo flooring and the flattened moldings used for the door framing. In 1992, a major renovation project began to modernize and renovate the historic fabric of the building. Space in the original 1911 floor plan was converted into the Court Clerk offices and a new Magistrate Hearing room. District Courtroom No. 1 was carefully restored to its original design ‚Äî including arched casement windows, period light fixtures, original color palette, and replicated plaster moldings for the ceiling. The renovations to the 1932 east wing allowed for significant alterations, most notably for the new District Courtroom No. 2, which features an open, two-story space illuminated by skylights and contemporary materials and finishes.

Mahon United States Courthouse is a courthouse of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit located in Fort Worth, Texas. Built in 1933, the building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2001 and was renamed in honor of district court judge Eldon Brooks Mahon in 2003. Building history The Eldon B. Mahon United States Courthouse Completed in 1934 during the Great Depression, the courthouse symbolized growth and renewed optimism in Fort Worth. Akin to other buildings of the 1930s, its design and construction fit the pattern of the New Deal-era federal building programs enacted to relieve widespread unemployment. Recognizing that the city's existing federal building was inadequate for the burgeoning federal agencies, Congress appropriated $1.215 million in June 1930 for the construction of a new U.S. Courthouse. The building's forward-looking design makes a significant contribution to the city's impressive collection of Depression-era architecture. Renowned Philadelphia architect Paul Philippe Cret, in association with prominent local architect Wiley G. Clarkson, designed the building under the direction of the Office of the Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury Department. Clarkson, a native Texan, designed many buildings in Fort Worth during the 1920s and 1930s, including the Trinity Episcopal Church, the Woolworth Building, and the Texas Christian University Library. In 1938, artist Frank Albert Mechau was commissioned under the Public Works Administration's art programs to paint three oil-on-canvas panels in the fourth-floor Court of Appeals. Mechau, a realistic painter who romanticized the American West, is a key figure of the western genre-with work on public view in Federal buildings and art museums across the country. Mechau's paintings were installed in 1940, becoming the only New Deal art commission sponsored in Fort Worth. The U.S. Courthouse was named in honor of Judge Eldon B. Mahon in 2003 for his service in the Northern District of Texas. Mahon presided over some of the most influential social and political cases in north Texas, including overseeing the racial integration of the Fort Worth School District-a 19-year endeavor. The Courthouse remains an important landmark in downtown Fort Worth and is a symbol of the continued Federal presence in Tarrant County. Architecture Art Deco detailing of a door The building is an impressive five-story structure, creating the illusion of a solid limestone mass rising to a height of 94 feet. It is designed in the Art Moderne style, incorporating classical elements. A steel and concrete structure faced with limestone veneer, each elevation adheres to classical principles of symmetry and articulation by a regular rhythm of bays with a centralized principal entrance. Art Moderne elements are embodied by the sharp angles and zigzag surfaces seen in the stacked fenestration of the upper stories, and in the geometric, low-relief abstraction of the ornamentation. The first three floors of the courthouse form a rectangular block, while upper floors are E-shaped, opening to the south to form two, three-sided light wells. Original access to the building was gained through three sets of bronze and glass double doors, flanked by Art Deco lanterns of aluminum and glass fronting West Tenth Street. Aluminum grilles in Mayan ziggurat, zigzag, Plains Indian arrows, and Egyptian lotus motifs are set over each pair of doors. Metal trim with Pueblo designs accentuates the windows of the second, third, and fourth floors. The smooth stone walls of the first story rise to a flattened, dentiled stringcourse before a shallow setback to the upper-story block. The outer bays of the second story have semicircular balconies of corbelled stone and metal railings. In between, eleven sets of three-story, stacked windows are each angled outward to the central mullion, creating a distinctive zigzag pattern across the surface of the facade. The window spandrels separating each floor feature moldings incised with black designs in Pueblo Indian motifs. The elongated bays are capped by horizontal windows at the fifth story, as the stone walls terminate to a flat roof. The east and west elevations are mirror images of each other and vary little from the facade, except in their width. Sumptuous finishes, crafted of marble and bronze, and Native American and Art Deco-influenced detailing create eye-catching public spaces on the interior. The former postal lobby and the second- and fourth-floor courtrooms are the most architecturally enriched. The north lobby retains its original terrazzo floor, composed of multicolored marble, forming a zigzag pattern bordered by rectangular designs in pink Lepanto marble along the wall perimeter. The Federal District Court, located on the second floor, displays finishes of the highest quality. Leather-sheathed doors open onto a room with 21-foot-high walls of rich oak paneling framed by dark Cedar Tennessee marble. Art Deco applications at the judge's white-oak bench and the plaster ornament of the ceiling are decorative focal points. The Court of Appeals on the fourth floor exhibits similar finishes and motifs, featuring 22-foot-high walls clad in American black walnut paneling that is rounded at the corners in a streamlined effect. The doorjambs and engaged columns are Yellow Kasota Fleuri marble, while the plaster ceiling displays a circular band of geometric patterns. At the rear of this room hang Frank Mechau's dramatic murals: \\"Texas Rangers in Camp,\\" \\"The Taking of Sam Bass,\\" and \\"Flags over Texas.\\" Depicting cowboys, rangers and scenic views of Texas, they are recognized for their skillfully executed abstract and linear style. Extensive renovations in 1994 to create a bankruptcy courtroom and offices partially reversed remodeling done in the 1950s and 1960s. Currently the south half of the lobby has been incorporated into the new courtroom, keeping the original north postal lobby intact. The U.S. Courthouse remains an outstanding example of the 1930s Art Moderne style.

Building history During the 1960s, the federal courts in Baltimore occupied the old U.S. Courthouse and Post Office, now known as Courthouse East, on Calvert Street. The courts rapidly outgrew their facilities, however, and required a larger building to accommodate the growing caseload. In 1970, the U.S. General Services Administration selected a parcel of land bounded by West Pratt, West Lombard, and South Hanover streets and Hopkins Place for a new federal courthouse. Congress allocated funding for the proposed building the same year. The courthouse was designed by RTKL Associates and contains elements of the International Style of architecture, first popularized in 1930s Europe and later adopted for federal buildings in the United States. The International Style does not reference regional architectural trends, so similar buildings can be found throughout the United States. In 1972, the building was named to honor Edward A. Garmatz (1903‚Äì1986). Garmatz, who was born and died in Baltimore, was a U.S. Representative for Maryland from 1947 to 1973, serving as the chairman of the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries for much of his political career. Garmatz was elected during a special vote after Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr., resigned his Congressional seat to become mayor of Baltimore. Completed in 1976 at a cost of $23 million, the new Edward A. Garmatz Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse had 532,020 gross square feet. The federal courts occupied the building later the same year. On May 1, 1978, a dedication ceremony was held in the plaza adjoining the building. In 2004, in Courtroom 5-D of the building, Ed Norris, former superintendent of the Maryland State Police, pleaded guilty to charges that he made illegal personal expenditures from the Baltimore Police Department's discretionary fund while serving as the department's commissioner. The building's tenants include the U.S. District Court, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, and the U.S. Court of Appeals. Architecture The construction of this building was part of an early phase of redevelopment for the area west of the Inner Harbor. Designed by RTKL Associates, a Baltimore-based, multidisciplinary firm of architects, engineers, and planners, the building exhibits characteristics of the International Style of architecture including a simple cubic mass, lack of ornamentation, and horizontal bands of windows. [1,2,3] The designers embraced contemporary trends, materials, and technology to develop an efficient and economical building that eschewed elaborate designs of earlier federal architecture. The nine-story box-like building has an L-shaped footprint with a flat roof. The building is a poured-concrete shell with a strong exterior horizontal emphasis created by alternating concrete strips and bands of fixed windows. The windows are separated by narrow aluminum mullions. Interior spaces evoke the clean, Modern exterior of the courthouse. Pale grey terrazzo floors and white walls are accented with dark grey painted surfaces and aluminum and silvertone metallic details such as handrails and vent grilles. Green marble panels cover elevator lobby walls, and granite tiles in pale and dark tones cover the floor. Gleaming steel elevator doors and surrounds reinforce the Modern interior design features and finishes. Courtrooms, some of which have been altered to make them appear more Classical, have dark wood wainscoting and jury boxes. Coffered ceilings contain both recessed lighting and hemispherical pendant lights. Clerestory windows with decorative geometric metalwork admit exterior light into some of the courtrooms. A covered patio with brick flooring, planted containers, chairs, and tables provides a transitional space between indoor and outdoor areas. The U.S. General Services Administration sought to add local context to the site during renovations completed in 2000. Most notably, O'Doherty Group Landscape Architecture redesigned the formerly stark brick plaza to include engaging design features that provide a human scale. Drawing inspiration from Baltimore's past, the landscape architects chose to celebrate the city's mill history, installing a water feature that invokes weirs (dams) and mill races, culminating in a semi- circular fountain base. Designers introduced terraced grassy lawn panels and indigenous plantings. Tiered stone retaining walls of varying lengths are constructed of reclaimed Belgian block from the city's streets and respond to the natural site topography. Unique pyramidal bollards add visual interest to the site while providing security for the building. Baltimore Federal, a large-scale sculpture by noted artist George Sugarman, was originally installed just outside the building's entrance in 1978. The brightly colored organic forms, executed in painted aluminum, create areas for seating and shelter. The sculpture was initially controversial. [4,5,6,] When the plaza was renovated in 2000, the work was conserved and relocated to its present site at the corner of South Hanover and West Lombard streets. Baltimore-born sculptor Reuben Kramer's rugged bronze depiction of Thurgood Marshall, accomplished lawyer, civil rights advocate, and the first African-American Supreme Court Justice, was unveiled in 1980.

It is the courthouse for the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places under the \\"United States Post Office, Court House and Custom House\\" name. Building history Construction of the Post Office, Court House and Custom House, as it was known historically, came at the end of a prosperous decade for the city of Louisville. The largest city in Kentucky, Louisville played a major role in the regional manufacturing and shipping industries, fostering an increasing population and urban development. New building projects highlighted the city's growth and prosperity, and the planned construction of the new federal building was another indication of Louisville's rising prominence. The new federal building was constructed from 1931 to 1932, under the Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury Department James A. Wetmore. The building was among the first recipients of artwork commissioned by the Treasury Relief Art Project, that employed painters and sculptors to incorporate art within the interiors of federal buildings nationwide. In 1935, artist Frank Weathers Long, a Kentucky native, was commissioned to paint ten murals depicting regional themes of commerce, agriculture, and sport. In 1936, with a growing need for more offices and courtrooms, the PWA also funded the addition of the sixth floor. The interior of the building was renovated in 1950, and in 1958 the sixth story was damaged by a fire, prompting additional renovations. In 1986, the building was renamed in honor of Marion Gene Snyder. Born in Louisville in 1928, Snyder was a prominent figure in Kentucky politics, serving several public offices, including U.S. Congressional Representative from 1963 to 1965 and 1967 to 1987. An American Classic: Gene Snyder U.S. Courthouse and Custom House, Louisville, Kentuckyvideo, 18 min., U.S. General Services Administration In 1986, the Post Office moved out, and Congress appropriated funds for a four-year renovation project to modernize the interiors and restore the key historic spaces on the first and second floors. As a result of the project, the building received numerous stewardship awards, including the 1997/98 and 1998/99 Office Building of the Year, Historic Building Category from the Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA); BOMA's 1999/2000 International Award for Government Building of the Year, Historic Building Category; and the 2001 Modernization Project award from Buildings Magazine. In 1999, the Gene Snyder U.S. Courthouse and Custom House was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Architecture The Gene Snyder U.S. Courthouse and Custom House is an excellent example of Classical Revival architecture, a style that federal government architects embraced during the early twentieth century as a method of symbolizing democratic ideals of government and power. More specifically, the building was inspired by the architecture of the U.S. Treasury Department Building in Washington, DC, designed a century earlier. Both buildings prominently feature a limestone facade composed of a long colonnade of tall, colossal columns raised on a ground-story base to an imposing and impressive effect. Unlike the Treasury Building, the Courthouse was constructed not of solid masonry, but of modern materials, including concrete and steel columns and beams, with Bedford limestone for the exterior veneer. Encompassing an entire city block, the rectangular building rises six stories (the fifth floor is concealed on the exterior behind the limestone entablature). The facade (south elevation) facing Broadway Street features a row of 18 engaged Corinthian columns with fluted shafts poised upon a rusticated base of arched windows aligned with the fenestration above. The colonnade is framed at each end by projecting pavilions, each with four columns and crowning pediments. The secondary east and west elevations are composed of 12 colossal Corinthian columns to match those of the facade. A continuous limestone entablature, composed of an architrave, frieze, dentil molding, and cornice, and a balustraded parapet cap the south, east, and west elevations. Above this, the unadorned smooth stone walls of the sixth story are subordinate to the articulated rhythm of the lower stories. The two primary entrances are recessed within the tripartite arches at the ends of the facade, and are accessed by stairs flanked by original bronze and glass light standards with claw feet and fluted columns. The glass and bronze doors are original, and retain their decorative surrounds and elliptical transoms containing bronze grilles. Post office mural The building's interior is primarily composed of individual offices connected by central corridors, with the exception of the main lobby on the first floor. Originally designed to provide space for post office patrons, the lobby is a grand space, with an arcade extending the length of the building. The lobby is finely detailed with original pink, green, and beige marble flooring with geometric insets, marble veneer for the walls and pilasters, and a pair of marble Doric order columns at each end. Paintings by Frank Weathers Long embellish the lobby walls, with murals titled Stock Farming and Agriculture in the east lobby and Ohio River Traffic and Coal Mining in the west lobby. The two main stairwells feature marble staircases with wrought-iron balusters and floral designs inset into wood handrails. Adjacent elevators retain their original bronze doors, displaying decorative medallions and Greek fretwork. Above the elevator doors are bronze acanthus-leaf moldings and lunettes with murals depicting postal delivery themes, also painted by Long. The second floor includes two original federal courtrooms designed with coffered wood ceilings, marble wainscoting, decorative pilasters, and arched windows. The law library features elegant details including Doric fluted, wood pilasters and an original plaster ceiling decorated with Greek fret band and wave molding. From 1986 to 1990, GSA launched an extensive renovation project. The office spaces were remodeled with modern amenities and contemporary interior design, including new floor and wall finishes. At the same time, original finishes and fixtures in the historic courtrooms and lobbies were rehabilitated and restored to their 1932 condition.

It was designated a National Historic Landmark, receiving this designation in 1974 and noted for its Egyptian Revival columns. and Construction on the building, designed to house multiple federal offices and store goods, began in 1848 and didn't finish until 1881 due to redesigns and the American Civil War. The U.S. Customs offices have been located there since the late 19th century. In 2008, it became home to the Audubon Insectarium, the largest free-standing American museum dedicated to insects. Building history The U.S. Custom House in New Orleans is one of the oldest and most important federal buildings in the Southern United States and one of the major works of architecture commissioned by the federal government in the 19th century. This monumental granite building was begun in 1848 and built over a period of 33 years. The grand Marble Hall in the center of the building is one of the finest Greek Revival interiors in the United States. Located a few blocks from the Mississippi River, the great waterway that enabled New Orleans to become an important port city, the U.S. Custom House was planned in the 1840s in response to increasing trade through the Mississippi Valley. The building was also designed to accommodate other Federal offices, most notably the main post office and federal courts. The Custom House in 2009 In 1847, the Treasury Department chose the design of Alexander Thompson Wood, and construction began in 1848. After Wood was replaced as architect in 1850, a succession of eight architects followed, each modifying the original design concept. The partially completed building was first occupied in 1856 when the U.S. Customs Service moved into the first floor. The post office followed in November 1860, and the building served as the city's main post office through the remainder of the 19th century. Although construction was suspended during the Civil War, the building was occupied briefly by Confederate forces and then by the Union Army after New Orleans was occupied in 1862. It was also used to house captured Confederate soldiers, reportedly up to 2,000 men at one time. Construction resumed in 1871, with the upper floor and roof plan and sections substantially revised under the direction of the Office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury, Alfred B. Mullett (1834‚Äì1890), the designer of the Old Executive Office Building in Washington, DC, and many other federal buildings nationwide. Construction of the U.S. Custom House was completed in 1881. In 1916, the building underwent major interior renovations following the move of the post office and courts to a new facility on Lafayette Square. Interior offices were subdivided and corridors reconfigured. Over the years, mechanical and electrical systems and suspended ceilings were added. Architecture The impressive exterior of the U.S. Custom House retains its original design, which includes modified Greek and Egyptian Revival elements. The immense four- story building occupies the full trapezoidal downtown city block bounded by Canal, North Peters, Iberville, and Decatur Streets. Due to the shape of the lot, the corner of the building at Canal and North Peters Streets is rounded. The majority of the building is constructed of brick sheathed in gray granite from Quincy, Massachusetts; however, the entablature material is cast iron. Each of the four facades is similar in design. In the center of each facade is a projecting pavilion consisting of four round, fluted, modified Egyptian, engaged columns. The first floor of the structure is faced with rusticated granite stonework. The cast-iron entablature contains widely spaced triglyphs (three vertical bands) in the frieze and dentils (small square blocks) in the cornice, and supports a triangular pediment above the central portico on each facade. Near both ends of each facade is a slightly projecting bay composed of four modified Egyptian pilasters supporting the entablature. On the first story of the exterior of the U.S. Custom House are a series of blind (vacant) niches, six on each facade. The original architect intended these niches to hold heroic statues of famous Americans. When the plans for the exterior were later simplified, the idea of installing statuary was abandoned. The floor plan of the U.S. Custom House is arranged around an impressive Greek Revival room known as the Marble Hall, one of the first such rooms in the country. This room is ornamented with Corinthian columns that depict the heads of the mythological god Mercury, guardian of boundaries, commerce, and roads, and the goddess Luna, whose crescent moon-shaped brow symbolizes the city's location at the crescent bend of the Mississippi River. The columns support a full classical entablature with an ornamented cornice and floral cresting. A deep cove above the cornice supports a sophisticated geometrically-composed skylight. Over the entrance at the North Peters Street end of the hall are sculptures depicting founder of New Orleans, Sieur de Bienville; General Andrew Jackson; and the pelican, the traditional symbol of Louisiana. In 1916, the building underwent major renovations following the move of the post office and courts to a new facility on Lafayette Square. Recent GSA restoration efforts have successfully recaptured the historic appearance of the building, exposing original components such as vaulted ceilings and replicating missing or deteriorated interior elements and finishes, such as the skylight over the stairs.

It is a courthouse for the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2015 for its extensive role in adjudicating issues of the American Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. John Minor Wisdom, for whom it is now named, was a judge on the Fifth Circuit during that period. Building history The John Minor Wisdom U.S. Court of Appeals Building originally served as the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse. In 1908, the New York architectural firm Hale and Rogers won a design competition for the building and U.S. Treasury Department officials approved their plans in 1909. Workers broke ground later that year on the site, which encompasses the block bounded by Lafayette, Camp, Magazine, and Capdeville streets overlooking Lafayette Square. Construction of the elaborate building took many years; the date 1912 is incised on the frieze on the Lafayette Street side, but the interior was not finished until 1915, with employees occupying their offices the following year. Originally, the post office occupied the entire first floor, while the Federal District Court and Court of Appeals were located on the second floor. Executive Branch agencies were on the third level. In 1961, needing additional space, the post office moved to a new facility. Two years later, the courts also vacated. The building was unoccupied until 1965, when it served as a public high school for three years after Hurricane Betsy destroyed McDonough 35 High School. Between 1971 and 1972, the federal building underwent an extensive restoration. Upon completion, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals returned to the building as its only tenant. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 and has since been featured in several films and television shows. In 1994, the building was renamed to honor John Minor Wisdom, a respected judge who served on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals from 1957 until his death in 1999. Wisdom strongly promoted civil rights and issued landmark decisions that supported school desegregation and voter rights. In 1993, President Bill Clinton awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. During Hurricane Katrina in 2005, wind and rain damaged the building, but there was no flooding. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges and staff briefly relocated to other cities and towns in the region because of damage and power outages, but returned to the building in December 2005 when the issues were resolved. Architecture The building is an excellent example of the Italian Renaissance Revival style of architecture. During its construction, author Russell F. Whitehead called the building \\"the most important public building of the New South.\\" Regional building materials were used throughout, including Mississippi and Louisiana pine, Tennessee and Georgia marble, and Louisiana gum. The monumental three- story building is faced in white Cherokee, Georgia, marble atop a gray granite base. The first story is articulated with deeply incised horizontal striations while the marble on the upper stories is cut in smooth ashlar blocks. Round- arch openings dominate the first story. Dramatic colonnades with Ionic columns are on the Camp and Magazine street elevations and support a cornice inscribed with the names of past Chief Justices of the Supreme Court. Projecting corner pavilions rise slightly above the roofline; each pavilion contains an ornate arched opening flanked by marble columns, both freestanding and attached, that are striated to match the pattern on the street level. The columns support entablatures that include classical balustrades. Windows with ornately carved hoods featuring split pediments and eagle-and-shield motifs are directly above the arched openings. Ionic order pilasters separate windows on the upper stories of the pavilions. A balustrade runs between each of the pavilions at the roofline, topping the recessed portion of each elevation. Other exterior elements typical to the Italian Renaissance Revival style of architecture include classical features such as pediments, triglyphs, and dentils, which are interspersed with foliated and floral designs. A unique detail is the arch keystones that have carved fish-scale patterns. Perhaps the most striking exterior features of the building are the groupings of four colossal statues placed at each of the building's corners. These identical copper and bronze sculptures are called History, Agriculture, Industry, and Arts, but are popularly known as The Ladies. Each figure holds an item associated with the concept it represents. History wears a bonnet; Agriculture holds a cornucopia; Industry holds a tool; and Arts holds a flower. The figures are seated around an armillary sphere banded by the signs of the zodiac. Each sculpture is twelve feet high and weighs one ton. The renowned Piccirilli Brothers, expert marble carvers who also executed Daniel Chester French's statue of President Abraham Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial, created The Ladies from drawings by architect James Gamble Rogers. The emphasis of the 1971 to 1972 restoration effort was on the impressive public interior spaces, which were returned to their original grandeur. The first floor lobby, known as the Great Hall, is an L-shaped space with marble columns that support an elaborate bronzed castplaster vaulted ceiling. The ceiling is richly decorated with bas relief floral medallions and motifs, geometric key designs, and allegorical figures. Spherical lights are held in place by bronze pendant fixtures that descend from the vaulted ceiling. The court's law library occupies the original postal work area on the first floor. Three courtrooms, each with an entry lobby with marble wainscot walls, are located on the second floor. The courtrooms are paneled in polished gum wood and bronze chandeliers hang from the ceiling. Distinctive wall sconces that feature large white globes supported by either cast-bronze eagles or snakes illuminate the spaces. The central courtroom is perhaps the most impressive. Called the En Banc courtroom, it was designed to seat all of the active judges on the Court of Appeals simultaneously so that they can hear important cases together. The plaster ceiling features medallions and other symbols and has been finished with a bronze glaze.

It is most commonly made by mixing Canadian rye whiskey and Canadian maple syrup. Maple liqueur is considered an important cultural beverage in certain Canadian festivals. In Canadian French, such a product is known as eau de vie d'√©rable.  History  Maple Syrup Production Maple liqueur is considered to be a traditional part of Canadian cuisine, in part because of its components being Canadian whiskey and Canadian maple syrup. Both of these components have their own unique history in Canadian cuisine. Notably, maple syrup has also been used in maple sap beer in areas such as Vermont. The process of mixing alcohol with maple syrup has been practiced traditionally in Canada for an extended period of time, and distilleries make their maple liqueur with these same processes.  Canadian maple syrup  left The practice of producing maple syrup was practiced by First Nations people in North America, long before Europeans arrived to Canada. First Nations people would collect maple sap in the process of curing meat. The practice of sap collection later was learned by Canadian settlers, who boiled the sap to produce maple syrup. Often, settlers would bore taps into the trees and place a collection bucket underneath it to collect sap. The maple leaf is on the Canadian flag and is a symbol of Canadian culture. As well, Agriculture Canada states that maple syrup continues to be introduced into liqueur blends. Modern collecting methods use tubing, connecting multiple maple trees together. The sap is then collected in a storage tank and evaporated using an evaporator. The basic process has not changed, although modern equipments and methods as stated before are now used. In total, Canada produces 71% of the world's pure maple syrup, and 91% of that is produced primarily in Quebec.  Canadian whiskey  Aged Canadian Whisky Canadian whiskey is described as a grain spirit that has been aged in charred oak barrels for at least three years. The practice originated from Scottish settlers, who brought over their practice from overseas. The primary ingredient is corn, but rye is important as it adds its own distinctive flavor. Currently, there are many brands of Canadian whiskey available. Whiskey tends to have an alcohol content of around 40%-50%, although this can be increased through means of distillation.  Production  left Maple liqueur is not commonly found in liquor stores as it is easy to make at home. The production process is simple and does not require any special equipment. Homemade maple liqueur is both easy to make and inexpensive. It can be enjoyed on its own, in coffee, or in various different cocktails. Ingredients needed are some kind of liquor to use as a base, usually rye whiskey. The only other ingredient needed to make maple liqueur is pure maple syrup. Table syrup cannot be used as it is often made with high fructose corn syrup and artificial flavouring instead of real maple. Maple syrup comes in various different grades, and the grade of a syrup is determined by its colour, clarity, density, and how strong the maple flavour is. As the sap harvesting season progresses, the maple syrup that is produced becomes darker and more caramel in colour. These darker syrups also tend to have the most intense maple flavour, compared to the lighter taste one would get from syrup produced early in the season. Darker syrups create a more intense maple flavour in the liqueur as well and because of this are often preferred when producing maple liqueur. The darker the syrup that is used, the more intense and full bodied the resulting liqueur will taste. The process of making maple liqueur is simple. Equal parts rye whiskey and maple syrup are combined in a sealable mason jar, mixed thoroughly and then left to sit in the refrigerator for at least two weeks. Other spices and ingredients can be added to give different flavors to the liqueur, such as glycerin, honey, or brown sugar. As is with standard aging processes, generally, the longer the liqueur is left to age, the better the final product. After this, the liqueur is ready to be consumed. As mentioned previously, commercially produced maple liqueurs are not very common due to how easy the liqueur is to make at home. They have started to increase in popularity in the early 2010s with Crown Royal, a popular whiskey brand, releasing its Crown Royal Maple Finished whiskey in 2013. Varieties other than whiskey also exist, with cream liqueurs being the second most common type. Examples such as Cabot Trail Maple Cream consist of pure maple syrup added to different combinations of rum, grain alcohols, and in this case fresh cream. Sortil√®ge is another popular Canadian brand based in Montreal that produces three distinct varieties of maple liqueurs: Sortil√®ge Whisky, Sortil√®ge Prestige, and Sortil√®ge Cream.  Usage and consumption  As with all alcoholic beverages, maple liqueur can often be mixed with other beverages for cocktails, and also goes well in coffee.  Beverages   Canadian immigrant  This shooter consists of equal portions of Kahl√∫a, butterscotch liqueur, and maple liqueur. Usually, these ingredients are mixed in a large shooter glass, and then chased with warm maple syrup.  The waffler  This drink is a favorite at the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts. Simply, a teaspoon of maple syrup is put in first, coating the sides of the glass. Then maple liqueur and Bailey's Irish Cream are added in a shot glass at a 1.5:1 ratio respectively. If done properly, Bailey's Irish Cream should form a layer on top, similarly to other shooters, such as a buttery nipple.  Coffee  Often, coffee can be served in conjunction with Bailey's Irish Cream or Kahlua. As a more culturally Canadian practice, maple liqueur can be used instead to provide smooth sweet maple tones. Maple cream Also known as maple butter, is a dairy less and all-naturally cream made by adding invertase to increase concentration. It is made of 1.5 oz. Maple liqueur and 1 oz. Vanilla Vodka, 4 oz. Vanilla ice cream, 1 scoop of ice, and a dash of maple syrup. The ingredients are evaporated, quickly cooled, stirred and then packaged at room temperature. The process increases the concentration of ingredients to produce a light colored with a smooth, creamy texture cream. Some common uses include as a spread on toast, bagels, muffins, pancakes, doughnuts and other baked goods.

It was built from 1867‚Äì1872 to house offices of the United States Customs Service, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Building history Located near Portland's waterfront, the U.S. Custom House is a testament to the city's maritime history. It was built to accommodate the city's growing customs business, which, by 1866, was collecting $900,000 annually in customs duties‚Äîmaking Portland one of the most significant seaports in the country. The building is typical of the notable designs completed under the direction of Alfred B. Mullett, Supervising Architect of the Treasury from 1865 to 1874. Constructed between 1867 and 1872, the U.S. Custom House combines elements of the Second Empire and Renaissance Revival styles. The need for the new U.S. Custom House was exacerbated by the Great Fire of July 4, 1866. The fire destroyed the Exchange Building‚Äîwhich had previously housed the customs office, post office and courts‚Äîas well as 1,800 other buildings in the center of the city. Although federal funds for the construction of buildings were limited during the post-Civil War period, the importance of maintaining Portland's customs business and rebuilding the city mandated the construction of the new government facility. Plans for designing the new U.S. Custom House were completed in 1866. Mullett was commissioned to design the new building, as well as a new post office and courthouse (no longer extant). Construction took five years to complete amid delays in obtaining granite for the upper stories. The U.S. Custom House is the best remaining example of Mullett's work in the state of Maine and continued to serve its original function until U.S. Customs and Border Protection moved out in 2012. A major renovation was completed in 2013 and the building now houses several other federal agencies. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Architecture United States Customs House as seen from Commercial Street The U.S. Custom House is a skillful blend of the Renaissance Revival and Second Empire styles, which were popular in the United States during the mid- to late 19th century. Its original design is largely intact. The three-story, free-standing, I-shaped structure is constructed of New Hampshire granite with a slate-shingled hipped roof. These fireproof materials were chosen in response to the 1866 fire. The building rests on a sloping lot that forms an embankment along the sides and the Fore Street entrance of the building. A heavy cast-iron railing, designed of tangent ovals, rests on top of the embankment. The basement level is accented with a rusticated granite exterior finish. The U.S. Custom House has a shallow I-shaped plan, with projecting pedimented entry pavilions on the Fore Street and Commercial Street facades. The entire building is dominated by large and handsome rhythmic, round-headed windows with simple keystones. The window openings are flanked by engaged Doric columns on the first and second stories. Square pilasters mark the corners of the pavilions and the facades. A cornice and balustrade surround the entire building. The cornice features ornamental triglyphs (three vertical bands separated by V-shaped grooves). Distinctive twin, square cupolas rise above the pedimented pavilions. Double Corinthian order pilasters flank arched Venetian windows, each of which is capped with a shallow pediment. The cupolas' distinctive mansard roofs are a defining feature of the Second Empire style. The building is organized around the grand two-story customs hall, which is the building's public showplace and occupies the central portions of the first and second floors. The marble floor of the hall is laid with a sophisticated checkerboard pattern. Two counters run the length of the room and are fashioned of several different types of marble that were quarried on an island in Lake Champlain. These include a dark veined marble for the base; a red variegated marble for the pilasters, cornice and panels; a jet-black marble for the beading around the panels; and a dove- gray marble for the counters. Encircling the hall at the second floor is a narrow gallery with a decorative iron rail. The gallery is ornamented with symbols relating to commerce in the United States, including corn and tobacco leaf motifs and dolphins flanked by oak and olive leaves. Fore Street facade The ceiling of the customs hall is highly ornamented. A large plaster cove rises from the second-floor openings to an elaborate plaster cornice and coffered ceiling. Groin (cross) vaults over each second floor-opening extend from the cove, and the ceiling beams are decorated with a Greek key pattern and bosses (elaborate joints) at beam intersections. An eight-foot, walnut, pedestal-mounted counter capped with a spherical clock stands at the center of the customs hall. The counter contains an octagonal writing surface decorated with flutes, bosses, a collar, and modified Ionic order scrolls. The original walnut woodwork is still intact throughout the building, as are the Italian marble fireplaces in the offices located at both ends of the building. The offices, which are more simply designed than the main hall, consist of plaster walls, and walnut baseboards, window surrounds, and doors. The original 2 story vault for storing valuables also remains. The U.S. Custom House has experienced only minor changes since it was constructed, and therefore exhibits a high degree of architectural integrity. The most notable alteration to the structure has occurred in the interior customs hall, where the original gas chandeliers have been replaced with the current surface-mounted ceiling fixtures. The basement was converted into office and dormitory space for the U.S. Coast Guard in 1983. The majority of the building's distinctive elements, such as the marbled checkerboard floor and decorative staircases, remain in place. In 1998, the aluminum doors, which were installed during the 1960s at the main entrances, were replaced with wooden doors similar in design and color to the original doors to the building.

It is a granite, steel frame structure measuring 252 feet, 8 inches by 139 feet 6 inches. It is an exceptionally distinguished example of Beaux Arts architecture and was built from 1903 through late 1907 from plans by Hornblower and Marshall, a Washington, D.C. firm. The ceiling of the Call Room, located in the pavilion, was painted by Francis Davis Millet (1846‚Äì1912). It served as Baltimore's Custom House until 1953. Since that time various Federal agencies have occupied the building. U.S. Custom House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Building history In the 18th and 19th centuries, Baltimore flourished as one of the nation's major commercial ports, its economy growing as foreign trade increased. In 1789, the First U.S. Congress established the United States Customs Service and named Baltimore as one of 59 collection districts. The first Baltimore custom house was at the intersection of South Gay between East Lombard and Water Streets, across from the present location. Around 1820 the government began to rent a wing of the Merchants' Exchange Building to house the Customs Service. Designed by J. Maximilian Godefroy, (1765-1838), and famous British-American architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe, (1764-1820), in an 'H' shaped structure and constructed in 1816-1820, the Merchant's Exchange Building was the largest domed building of its kind in America and a landmark of the city symbolizing its commercial importance. It continued to house the U.S. Customs Service, along with the U.S. Courthouse for District and Circuit Court of Appeals, Post Office and a branch of the Bank of the United States and separate wings for the first City Hall and another for offices of shipping companies, brokers, attorneys and related maritime businesses through the end of the 19th Century. In April 1865, the rotunda was the site of a viewing ceremony during the long procession winding through the downtown city streets for assassinated 16th President Abraham Lincoln as later his decorated train traveled through the Northern States back to his home in Springfield, Illinois for burial. In 1900 the Treasury Department held a design competition for Baltimore's third custom house. It was to be built on the site of the famed Merchant's Exchange. The winning entry was by the prominent Washington, D.C. firm of Hornblower and Marshall. The building's cornerstone was laid on June 13, 1903 in a ceremony attended by several hundred people. On February 7‚Äì8, 1904 as construction neared the third floor, a catastrophic fire swept through downtown Baltimore. Over 1,500 buildings were destroyed, and the Custom House suffered major damage. Many of the granite blocks had been split by the heat. These had to be removed and replaced in what proved to be a difficult and costly process. The structure's northwest corner was almost entirely rebuilt. Despite this setback, construction continued, and the building was completed and occupied at the end of 1907. From the time of its completion, the Custom House was widely praised as a triumph of both design and workmanship. In 1908, the American Architect and Building News declared, \\"The result achieved by the intelligent cooperation of architect and artist stamps Baltimore's new Custom House as among the most successful public buildings erected in this country.\\" Today the Custom House remains an outstanding interpretation of the Beaux-Arts vision and a monument to the dignity of the federal government. Architecture The U.S. Custom House in Baltimore is located two blocks north of the Inner Harbor, on a gently sloping site bounded by Gay, Lombard, and Water Streets. The six-story building, 92 feet high from base to roof balustrade, displays an axial symmetry and imposing presence characteristic of the Beaux-Arts style. The building's architects, Joseph C. Hornblower (1848‚Äì1908) and John Rush Marshall (1851‚Äì1927), began their careers in the Office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury Department. They used Hornblower's training at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts and the experiences of their European tours to apply French academic planning and organizational principles to American civic architecture. The steel structure and masonry bearing walls are faced with granite quarried near Laurel, Maryland, and Mount Airy, North Carolina. The primary facade fronts Gay Street. A smooth-faced basement level (extending from grade up to a watertable course) rises to a heavily rusticated first floor. The second through fourth stories are articulated by three-story engaged Ionic columns, flanking the recessed window bays. Alternating segmental and triangular pediments carried on consoles top the second-story windows. The smooth columns support a full entablature and roof balustrade, which wrap around the building and conceal the attic story and flat roof. The Gay Street entrance is approached by marble steps that are flanked by plinths with wrought-iron lamp standards with lamps resembling 18th century ship's stern lanterns. The entrance doors are protected behind wrought-iron grillework. The west (Commerce Street) side of the building reveals an \\"E-shaped\\" plan. The double-story Call Room pavilion forms the middle arm of the \\"E\\" and is on axis with the entrance. Rusticated corners flank a five-bay window arcade. The window spandrels are decorated with carvings depicting sea monsters, shells, and other nautical ornamentation that reflect the Custom House's proximity to Baltimore's Inner Harbor. A balustraded parapet shields the copper-clad roof of the pavilion. Call Room The main lobby has a marble floor with an inlaid brass compass design. The walls are paneled with variegated marble. The lobby is flanked by elevators and stairhalls, with marble stairs and ornamental iron and brass railings. A narrow corridor connects the lobby to the historic Call Room where customs revenues were paid. The Call Room is the Custom House's most impressive, and historically significant, space. The walls have paired Ionic pilasters supporting an entablature with a paneled frieze. The paneled cove rises to the central ceiling panel, measuring 63 feet by 30 feet, and adorned with a mural entitled Entering the Harbour. It depicts a fleet of ten sailing vessels: ships including a whaler, barks, a barquentine, a brig, and a schooner entering the harbor. The panels of the cove and frieze, five lunettes on the east wall, and the borders of the ceiling panel depict the evolution of navigation. They portray over 125 vessels, from ancient Egyptian ships to the R.M.S. Mauretania of 1907, accompanied by J. P. Morgan's yacht, the Corsair. All of the murals were painted by Francis Davis Millet, a prominent American muralist of the period. Millet died just a few years after these murals were completed, perishing along with over 1,500 others in the sinking of the R.M.S. Titanic in 1912.

In accordance with the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, the fleet defended the West Coast of Canada as well as Allied shipping in the Pacific during World War I. Background As Canada emerged from the 19th century it still depended on the British Royal Navy for maritime defence. As the British and the Germans entered a naval arms race; the British, concerned that the Germans would outproduce them, asked their Dominion governments to contribute financially to the building of new ships at the 1909 Imperial Conference. This request imposed upon the Canadian Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier became known as the \\"naval question\\". Due to internal conflicts Laurier decided that, instead of giving money to the British Royal Navy, Canada would build its own Navy. A few ships were built or bought by the fledgling Canadian Navy but the decision was unpopular in Canada and contributed to the downfall of the Laurier government. In the years leading up to World War I, Japan increased its presence near the West coast of North America. In early 1914, Japanese cruisers sailed the Pacific coast of America and Canada with a significant number visiting Canada's west coast, including and which visited Vancouver in June 1914. The ships and Vice-Admiral Kuroi, his captains, staff and the cadets were given a reception by the provincial government. The band of the 88th Fusiliers played for the occasion. First World War When World War I broke out in 1914, Canada's outdated ships were tasked with defence of the Atlantic shipping lifeline to the UK. The Royal Navy decided to concentrate on the Atlantic theatre with the defence of Canada's west coast left to its ally, Imperial Japan. Newspapers at the time claimed that if it was not for the Japanese Navy the German Imperial Navy would have \\"shelled Victoria and Vancouver to fragments.\\" Also on British request, the Japanese navy sent one or two cruisers from Vladivostok to Vancouver to assist in the transport of gold bullion.

Plot Ambleton Delight is a drama based on a true story, set in a small contemporary Sussex village by the name of Ambleton during the apple harvest season.

It is a brick and stone building on Main Street (New York State Route 5) erected in the late 1930s. Its Colonial Revival design, featuring a hipped roof and limestone facing, is unique among post offices in the state as the only small one with a clock tower or limestone facing. This is a result of half of the construction being financed privately by a local benefactor. In 1989 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the only one in Genesee County so recognized independently.The 1919 Batavia post office, though determined ineligible for inclusion on the Register, is still a contributing property to the Genesee County Courthouse Historic District per , p. 59. Building The post office is located at the northeast corner of Main and Mill streets, at the eastern edge of downtown Le Roy, two blocks east of the Clay and Lake street (New York State Route 19). To its east a stone retaining wall separates it from Oatka Creek, next to a partial dam. South and west are other commercial properties; a parking lot is located to the north. The lot slopes significantly enough due to the proximity of the creek, exposing the basement on the north (rear) side. The building itself is an almost square one-story steel frame structure, five bays on the south (front), east and north and six on the west. It is faced in coursed ashlar limestone and topped by a hipped roof shingled in slate, set off by a shallow cornice and parapet with balustraded sections above the windows, around the entire roofline. In the center is a square wooden cupola with a dome, illuminated electric clock and weather vane. A wide stone chimney rises from the rear. In the center of the south fa√ßade is the recessed main entryway, flanked by metal lanterns. Above the doors are a large radiating fanlight and a small hood supported by stone consoles. It is flanked by 12-over-12 double-hung wooden sash windows. At the end bays are recessed niches with small semicircular openings at the top. Above all the windows are carved panels depicting, in alternation, garlands and postal motifs. Metal letters affixed above them, below the cornice, spell out \\"UNITED STATES POST OFFICE\\" with smaller letters saying \\"LE ROY NEW YORK\\" in the frieze above the doors. At the south end of the side facades are double-recessed arched 20-over-15 sash windows on slightly projecting portions with carved medallions. Other windows on those facades are identical to the flanking windows on the front. A wooden canopy shelters the loading dock at the rear. Walled stone steps lead to the modern double metal-and-glass double doors at the main entrance. They open into a wooden vestibule. Behind it is the L-shaped main lobby, occupying four of the front five bays and stretching around the southwest corner. The postmaster's office is in the southeast corner. It retains many original finishes, from black and white checkerboard terrazzo flooring, black marble borders and baseboard and veined gray marble wainscoting to seven feet () along the walls. Above is a plaster wall and ceiling with molded cornice. The insides of the windows are also recessed and decorated with beaded molding. The screenline features unusual angled glass and metal grilles above the teller windows and lockboxes. History Le Roy was established in the last years of the 18th century, before the Holland Purchase, covering the vast majority of the other land in Western New York, was initiated. The intersection of the creek and a major Iroquois trail through the region (today Route 5) made it an ideal place for a mill. By 1804 it had a post office, and 30 years later it was incorporated as a village. Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, the post office was housed in a variety of rented or leased locations in the village. In 1929, Congress, lobbied by local resident Ernest L. Woodward, heir to the Jell-O fortune, authorized the construction of a dedicated facility in the village and appropriated funds for its construction as an amendment to the Public Buildings Act. It took longer to start and complete than other New Deal post offices in New York, partly due to Woodward's involvement. Congress reiterated its authorization in another amendment two years later passed in response to the onset of the Great Depression, after Woodward donated land federal and state inspectors approved after flying over it. Despite the lack of adequate frontage, it had other advantages that made it an ideal site. The Treasury Department, which oversaw postal construction, asked Woodward to obtain additional land along the creek from the Niagara Hudson Company, the local electric utility, for a retaining wall. He did, but the Treasury refused to accept the deed over concerns about liability the government might face from past flood damage. After many trips to Washington to lobby officials there, Woodward resolved the impasse by obtaining a surety bond absolving Niagara Hudson. Woodward suggested that Rochester architect James Arnold, who was familiar with Le Roy's downtown, be commissioned to design the building. The recommendation was accepted, and Arnold promptly produced a building. It was reported to be \\"almost an exact copy\\" of the Radcliffe Library at Oxford University. Woodward, U.S. Representative Archie D. Sanders, the postmaster and village officials sent a petition to Treasury requesting that the stone used be native to the area. Due to the change in presidential administrations and the beginning of the New Deal, a final appropriation was delayed. In November 1933 the budget was halved when president Franklin D. Roosevelt decided to focus on reforestation instead. Many village residents reconsidered whether a post office that reflected the community could be built with the limited funds available. Woodward rallied residents to lobby for the restoration of the full appropriation, and they secured it the next year. Most of the money allocated would go to building the retaining wall, after the village and the government resolved a dispute over which of them would pay for how much. Construction was plagued by problems from the start. No local stonecutters were available, and Indiana limestone was therefore substituted for local stone. The low bidder on the job, a Kenmore contractor, went bankrupt before construction could begin in late 1935. The bonding company chose a Rochester firm to replace it, and the cornerstone was laid in August 1936, without any of the usual ceremonies. After learning that the contractor had bid on the assumption that they were to be building a brick structure, Woodward paid for the limestone facing himself. He further intervened to delay the building's scheduled opening in the spring of 1937, dissatisfied with the roof. He felt the original flat roof, a feature of many post offices of the era, looked \\"squatty\\" and undistinguished. That summer plans for the current roof, with clock tower, were approved, and construction began again. The building was finally dedicated in 1938, almost two years to the day after construction began. It was estimated that the total cost of construction, including the monies donated by Woodward, was almost $90,000 ($ in contemporary dollars). As a result of his contribution, the Le Roy post office is the only small one in the state with a clock tower and limestone facing. Its hipped roof with parapet is also distinctive.

His book Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists (2003) is a study of \\"relationship capitalism\\". In A Capitalism for the People: Recapturing the Lost Genius of American Prosperity (2012), Zingales \\"suggests that channeling populist anger can reinvigorate the power of competition and reverse the movement toward a 'crony system'.\\" Career Zingales received a bachelor's degree in economics from Bocconi University in Milan. In 1992 he earned a Ph.D. in Economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with the completion of his thesis, titled The value of corporate control, under the supervision of James M. Poterba and Oliver Hart. In the same year he joined the faculty of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, where he is the Robert C. McCormack Distinguished Service Professor of Entrepreneurship and Finance. Zingales also serves as a member of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation. Positions Zingales has been featured prominently in news media, which falls in line with his belief that economists should take a more public stance regarding what they believe in. While a traditional economist in many respects, he is known for some of his unique opinions. He has advocated replacing all taxes with a single consumption tax, a position usually associated with political conservatives. On the other hand, he has voiced support for greater regulation of the banking industry. Perhaps most interesting is his support of the United States debt ceiling, which is almost universally held in low regard by his colleagues. In July 2012, Zingales took part in the 'No-Brainer Economic Platform' project of NPR's program Planet Money. He supported a six-part reform plan that involved eliminating all American income, corporate, and payroll taxes as well as the war on drugs and replacing the system with a broad consumption tax (including taxing formerly illegal substances). Zingales generated controversy in 2018 when he invited former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon to debate globalization and immigration at the University of Chicago against an undecided expert in the field. The decision sparked protests from students and faculty given Bannon's history of controversial statements. Studies His main field of study is business economics, with a heavy focus on organizations and entrepreneurship. Awards He was the winner of the 2003 Germ√°n Bern√°cer Prize to the best European economist under 40 working in macro-finance.

Taxonomy and naming Ricinocarpos pinifolius was first formally described in 1817 by Ren√© Louiche Desfontaines and the description was published in Memoires du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle. The specific epithet (pinifolius) is from the Latin words pinus meaning \\"pine\\" and folium meaning \\"leaf\\". Distribution and habitat The wedding bush is found in sandy soils in heath and open forests mostly in coastal locations in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania and the Northern Territory.

They play in the Ardal Leagues North West, which is in the third tier of the Welsh football league system. The team, originally Brymbo Steelworks F.C., was formed as part of Brymbo Steelworks. History For a full history see; List of football seasons involving Brymbo teams Brymbo Football Club was formed over 60 years ago as part of the Brymbo Steelworks Complex. During their history Brymbo F.C. have won the Welsh National League (Wrexham Area) on fourteen occasions and have numerous Cup successes, the major ones being the 1967 Welsh Amateur Cup win and the Welsh F.A. Brymbo F.C became winners of the Cymru Alliance League Cup at the first attempt under management of Gareth Powell who later went onto manage LEX X1. Gareth Powell had also managed Cefn Druids who helped the club steadily consolidated in the Cymru Alliance, helped by a renewed youth policy who strolled to the 1998/99 Cymru Alliance championship, scoring over 100 goals in the process. Merger with New Broughton In 1996, Brymbo merged with neighbouring village team New Broughton F.C. to create Brymbo Broughton. At that time Brymbo played in the Cymru Alliance League while New Broughton were in the Welsh National League (Wrexham Area) Premier Division. New Broughton had a good, experienced Committee and were financially sound, but unfortunately their playing facilities (which were Council owned) did not reach the standards set for a higher level of football. Brymbo, however, had excellent facilities but were lacking experience and expertise in key off-field positions and were financially insecure. Merger with Summerhill United In 2005, Brymbo Broughton merged with Summerhill United to form Summerhill Brymbo. This lasted for one season before the name was reverted to Brymbo for the 2006‚Äì07 season. In the 2018‚Äì19 season the club originally finished third in the league. After the end of the season were deducted the second highest points in Welsh league history, 63 points, and instead finished bottom of the league.https://clwbpeldroed.org/2019/08/29/brymbo-queens-park-faw-national- league/ The club avoided relegation from the division as FC Nomads of Connah‚Äôs Quay withdrew from the league and Hawarden Rangers accepted relegation.

In 1991 an enhanced version was released as MiG-29M Super Fulcrum. Overview The player flies a Mikoyan MiG-29 on solo missions against a range of enemies around the world. There are six available missions: #Basic Training #Arctic reconnaissance #Combat over the Great Wall of China #Oil refinery attack #Anti-terrorist attack #Nuclear plant attack The MiG-29 is armed with AA-8 Aphid air-to-air missiles, AS-7 Kerry air-to-surface missiles, S-24 rockets, as well as a cannon. Enemies include SAMs, Harriers, Shenyang F-7s, Mirage 2000s and other MiG-29s. Development The Amiga and Atari ST versions of MiG-29 Fulcrum lack the option of a complex mode, limiting the game to simple mode only. British pilot John Farley was consulted during MiG-29 Fulcrum's development as he was one of the few people outside of Russia to have flown a real MiG-29 Fulcrum; his input changed some aspects of the game. Farley stated that the game isn't \\"oversimplified\\", calling it \\"the nearest thing to actually flying the plane\\". While the game was programmed by Simis, MiG-29 Fulcrum was designed by the game studio The Kremlin. MiG-29 Fulcrum's simulaton software was written in C by David Payne and Jonathan Newth; Payne previously worked at British Aerospace, and Newth once worked for IBM. The MiG-29 Fulcrum plane was selected as The Kremlin team felt that many American planes already had simulations created for them, and selected the MiG-29 while reading Soviet Weekly. The Russian News Agency (TASS) assisted in MiG-29 Fulcrum's development, providing flight data, information regarding the MiG-29's weapons, as well as access to their photo archive. Reception The One gave the DOS version of MiG-29 Fulcrum an overall score of 89%, calling it \\"one of the best introductions to the world of flight simulators\\" due to the difficulty options of 'simple' or 'complex', and further said that the plane is \\"a joy to fly\\". The One praised the realism of the simulation in complex mode, but criticized the game's overall presentation, expressing that other flight simulators have more customisable options, such as choosing weapons & marking waypoints, which MiG-29 Fulcrum lacks. Computer Gaming World's 1992 and 1994 surveys of wargames with modern settings gave the game two and a half stars out of five, and criticized the game's realism.

Hagler is also known by several other names and other spellings, such as King Haigler, Haiglar, Nopkehe, Arataswa and Oroloswa. Hagler's anglicized name is possibly a nickname derived from his tendency to bargain or \\"haggle\\" over political decisions, although there is no conclusive evidence to support this. Early life Hagler was probably born around 1700 in the region traditionally occupied by the Catawba along the Catawba River in what is now North Carolina. Little is known of Hagler's early life. He may have attended a European school in Virginia, because in April 1717 King Whitmannetaughehee agreed to send eleven Catawba boys to be educated for one year at Fort Christanna in Virginia. The boys were in fact hostages sent to guarantee the Catawba's promise to withdraw from the Yamasee War. Hagler may have been one of these boys, which would account for his fluency in English, much commented-on in contemporary records.Scott Syfert, Eminent Charlotteans: Twelve Historical Profiles from North Carolina's Queen City, McFarland, 2018; pp. 9-24Douglas S.

Election as chief Hagler became eractasswa (chief) after the death of King Yanabe Yalangway, who was murdered by a group of Iroquois warriors in October 1750. In keeping with Catawba tradition, the new chief (Hagler) was the former chief‚Äòs sister's son. Immediately after Yalangway's death, Hagler was elected by the Catawba General Council to the lead the tribe. Tribal politics were in chaos at the time, as fifteen of the most prominent Catawba leaders had attended a conference in Charles Town in the fall of 1749 and had all died of infectious diseases acquired from European settlers. In spite of the danger, Hagler traveled to Charleston in late 1750 to receive a military commission as Chief of the Catawbas from Governor James Glen, a form of colonial recognition of tribal leaders.James H. Merrell, The Indians‚Äô New World: Catawbas and Their Neighbors from European Contact through the Era of Removal, Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture, University of North Carolina Press Books, 2012. Peace treaties with other Native American groups One of Hagler's first tasks was to negotiate a peace treaty with the Iroquois Six Nations. In June 1751 Hagler, accompanied by Lieutenant Governor William Bull and a delegation of Catawba leaders,Jerry C. Cashion, \\"Hagler (Arataswa or Oroloswa)\\" in the Dictionary of North Carolina Biography, edited by William S. Powell. University of North Carolina Press, 1996. attended a peace conference in Albany, New York, where Hagler smoked a peace pipe with the Mohawk leader Hendrick Theyanoguin. In 1752 an Iroquois delegation visited the Catawba and an exchange of prisoners followed. The Catawba also brokered a peace treaty with the Shawnee, who were not members of the Six Nations federation. The Catawba were invited to incorporate with the Cherokee but Hagler refused this offer. Opposition to the sale of alcohol to the Catawba Hagler became well-known for being one of the first Native American leaders to publicly oppose the sale and distribution of alcohol in indigenous communities. On August 29, 1754 he stated, in a speech in Catawba to James Carter and Alexander Osborne, Commissioners of the State of North Carolina: > Brothers, here is One thing You Yourselves are to Blame very much in: That > is, You Rot Your grain in Tubs, out of which you take and make Strong > Spirits. You sell it to our young men and give it them; many times they get > very Drunk with it. This is the Very Cause that they oftentimes Commit those > Crimes that is offensive to You and us and all thro' the Effect of that > Drink. It is also very bad for our people, for it Rots their guts and Causes > our men to get very sick and many of our people has Lately Died by the > Effects of that strong Drink, and I heartily wish You would do something to > prevent Your People from Daring to Sell or give them any of that Strong > Drink.\\"Treaty between North Carolina and King Hagler and the Catawba > Indians.\\" Colonial and State Records of North Carolina, Volume 05, p. 144a. > August 29, 1754 (retrieved 3 July 2019) On 26 May 1756, he met with North Carolina Chief Justice Peter Henley in Salisbury, North Carolina to discuss the provisions of a recent treaty.\\"Henley, Peter\\" from the Dictionary of North Carolina Biography edited by William S. Powell, University of North Carolina Press, 1996. Hagler took another opportunity to decry the sale of alcohol to the Catawba: > I desire a stop may be put to the selling of strong Liquors by the White > people to my people especially near the Indian Nation. If the White people > make strong drink, let them sell it to one another or drink it in their own > Families. This will avoid a great deal of mischief which otherwise will > happen from my people getting drunk and quarreling with the White > people.James H. Williams, \\"King Hagler, Catawba Chieftain,\\" The Charlotte > Museum of HistoryMary Kratt, Charlotte North Carolina: A Brief History, > Charleston, SC: The History Press, 2009\\"Report by Peter Henley concerning > his conference with King Hagler and the Catawba Nation,\\" Native Heritage > Project, posted on September 6, 2012 Hagler also attempted to discipline Catawbas who committed crimes while intoxicated, contrary to the traditional Catawba custom of pardoning such behavior as a form of temporary madness. In 1754 Hagler supported the execution of a Catawba warrior who, while drunk, had murdered a young girl. The execution was carried out by the perpetrator's cousin in the presence of colonial witnesses, \\"the White people, in Order to shew our Willingness to punish such offenders.\\"William Laurence Saunders, The Colonial and State Records of North Carolina, Volume 05, p. 142. E. M. Uzzell, state printer, Raleigh, North Carolina, 1887. In response to Hagler's complaints, regulations adopted at the Augusta Conference of 1767 attempted to limit the amount of alcohol brought into Native American communities: \\"Any Trader who by himself, substitute, or servant, shall carry more than fifteen Gallons of Rum, at any one time, into any nation of Indians...shall forfeit his bond and license.\\"\\"Regulations for the Better Carrying on the Trade with the Indian Tribes in the Southern District.\\" Quoted in Kathryn E. Braund, Deerskins and Duffels: Creek Indian Trade with Anglo-America, 1685-1815. Indians of the Southeast, U. of Nebraska Press, 1996. Hagler and Catawba land rights Fort Catawba In May of 1756 Hagler was asked to provide Catawba warriors to support the British during the French and Indian War (1754-1763), and he pledged to contribute the services of forty warriors. In return, Hagler requested that North Carolina Governor Arthur Dobbs supply gifts and ammunition and construct a fort to protect the Catawba while their warriors were away fighting for the British. Dobbs reluctantly agreed, and a site was selected and purchased near what is now Old Fort, North Carolina. He then sent General Hugh Waddell and a troop of rangers to begin building. The project was interrupted several times, as relations between Hagler and Dobbs were not always good, but the fort was eventually completed in late 1760. Pine Tree Hill Treaty Between 1738 and 1759, a series of smallpox epidemics ravaged Native American communities along the east coast of North America. In the fall of 1758, twenty-five Catawba warriors returning from General John Forbes' campaign against the French, brought smallpox to South Carolina. By 1759, the Catawba nation had been severely reduced, so that no more than a thousand Catawbas survived. European settlers began encroaching on the Catawbas' traditional lands, now sparsely populated, leading Hagler to negotiate the Pine Tree Hill Treaty in 1760, with Edmond Atkin, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Southern District at Camden, South Carolina (then known as Pine Tree Hill). This guaranteed the Catawba a territory near Waxhaw, North Carolina occupying some two million acres along the Catawba River, in exchange for 55,000 square miles that the Catawba considered to be their traditional home, occupying part of North Carolina and much of South Carolina and extending into Virginia. Mortality from smallpox, influenza and other infections continued to reduce the Catawba population. On July 5th, 1762, Governor Arthur Dobbs wrote: \\"Their number of Warriors have been reduced in a few years, by Haglar's Confession, from 300 to 50 and all their males do not exceed 100, old and young included, so they are now scarce a nation but a small village.\\"Walter Clark, William Laurence Saunders, Stephen Beauregard Weeks, editors.

Hale, 1888; p. 787 Death and burial On August 30, 1763, Hagler was traveling to Waxhaw when he was ambushed and killed by a band of seven Shawnees. He was reportedly shot six times and then scalped. The motive for the killing was never clearly determined. Hagler was interred with his most valuable possessions, but the grave site was desecrated by white settlers soon after his burial. His body was later moved to a secret location. Following Hagler's death, the conditions of the Pine Tree Hill Treaty were forgotten and the Catawba were forced onto a tiny reservation of 15 square miles near Lancaster, South Carolina. Legacy James H. Merrell characterizes Hagler as a shrewd negotiator who struck a balance between preserving Catawba tradition and adapting to the pressures of the growing colonial population: > On the one hand, [Hagler] operated within a dual colonial and Catawba > framework he had not constructed and could not escape. He was not the first > Eractasswa to acknowledge his people's dependence upon Anglo-America, nor > was he the first to negotiate with colonial officials...On the other hand, > however, Nopkehe was particularly well suited by background and temperament > to fulfill the simultaneous demands of old and young, settlers and distant > officials. By birth and upbringing he fit a traditional mold; through > experience he had learned at once the futility of challenging colonial > society openly and the means of manipulating that society covertly...At a > critical time in the life of the Nation Hagler was instrumental in > maintaining intercultural peace and internal unity, charting a course > through the troubled waters of depopulation, dependence, and despair on > which so many other Indian nations foundered.

For example, in March 2012, the facility's total population was more than 166.6% of its design capacity. As of April 30, 2020, RJDCF was incarcerating people at 127.2% of its design capacity, with 3,806 occupants. In 1989, RJDCF opened a reception center which accepted newly-sentenced inmates from across Southern California. However, in 2012, the institution changed from its previous reception center mission, and completed the conversion of three of its five facilities to sensitive needs yards. Other missions have included housing and providing treatment to inmates with severe mental illnesses, and inmates who have been identified as having medium to high risk medical concerns.

The building consists of twin 26-story high-rise towers, which sit on axis to each other, and a low, 4-story building. This combination of tall towers paired with low buildings is a common Modern form that is used extensively throughout the United States and abroad. The double towers increase the number of offices lit by natural light and decrease the visual bulk that a single monolithic building would create. The building contains . The exterior of the towers is constructed of pre-cast reinforced concrete. The lower sections are faced with polished granite. All aluminum work has a dark anodized finish in a medium gray tone. A glass-enclosed walkway connects the four-story building to the towers. Like the towers, the low building's facade is made of concrete and glass. Overall, the exterior lacks ornamentation, instead displaying a stark functionality. Bands of windows wrap around the towers; corner windows have rounded edges. The bases of the towers have arcades with entrances set back beneath a covered area supported by piers. The tops of the towers are distinguished by metal louvers. An exposed glass atrium connects the two towers at the ground level. A glass-enclosed walkway connects the four-story building to the towers. Like the towers, the low building's facade is made of concrete and glass. Vertical slabs form piers that interrupt the horizontality of the building and create the off-center entrance, which is articulated by a cantilevered porch. A protruding second story creates a covered pathway to shelter visitors. The building's design result in 45% of the available space being occupied by the structure. The remaining portion contains terraces, plazas, landscaping, a sunken patio, and driveways. Plazas are surfaced with stone in most sections. Paved walkways are interspersed throughout. A tiered stair platform of cement and brick leads to the low building. In 1963, Gropius and Glaser saw sculpture by artist Dimitri Hadzi, who worked in Modern abstract forms, and decided Hadzi's style would be appropriate for the federal building. They commissioned Hadzi to produce a bronze sculpture called Thermopylae, which is located in front of one of the towers. The abstract sculpture was created in 1966 and inspired by President Kennedy's book, Profiles in Courage, and his war record. Two other artists created tributes to John F. Kennedy. Herbert Ferber designed an abstract sculpture of welded copper and stainless steel titled Full Circle: Profile in Courage, which is in the interior light court.

Architect Robert Mills designed the custom house in 1834 in a Greek Revival style. It has been used by the U.S. Customs Service ever since, and today serves as a port of entry. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 for its architectural significance as one of the finest modest Greek Revival government buildings in New England. Building history In 1789, New Bedford was chosen to be the administrative center of the Tenth U.S. Customs District. Colonel Edward Pope was chosen to be the district's first collector. By 1825, New Bedford had surpassed Nantucket as the world capital of the whaling industry, a distinction it would hold for much of the nineteenth century. In response to the importance of New Bedford as a port city, the U.S. Congress authorized the construction of a Custom House in 1832. The initial appropriation was $15,000, but the funds were insufficient to meet new U.S. Treasury Department requirements for fireproof construction. With the allocation of additional appropriations, construction began in 1834. The final cost was approximately $31,000. The design of the U.S. Custom House is attributed to Robert Mills (1781‚Äì1855), architect of the U.S. Treasury Building and the U.S. Patent Office in Washington, DC. Mills also designed three other U.S. Custom Houses in New England at about the same time: those in New London and Middletown, Connecticut, and Newburyport, Massachusetts. Although the four Greek Revival U.S. Custom Houses are similar in scale, plan, materials, and detailing, the New Bedford building is the largest and most architecturally elaborate. Collectively, the buildings represent an early example of standardized construction and supervision that formed a pattern of design for the federal building program in later years. Considered functionally outdated in 1958, the U.S. Custom House was extensively restored in 1962. It was listed as a contributing building in the New Bedford National Historic Landmark District in 1966. In 1970 it was designated a National Historic Landmark and listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The U.S. Custom House became part of the New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park in 1996. Architecture The U.S. Custom House in New Bedford, erected between 1834‚Äì1836, is an exceptional illustration of a modest public building designed in the Greek Revival style. Located a few blocks from the waterfront, the oblong, symmetrical building occupies most of its site with the principal entrance and first story located approximately four feet above grade. Set 50-feet above the tide level with an uninterrupted view of the harbor, the U.S. Custom House has been a city landmark since its completion. The design of federal buildings changed significantly following a fire in 1833 that destroyed the Executive Office Building in Washington, DC. Seeking to end the onslaught of fires, the Treasury Department instituted new requirements for fireproofing federal buildings. The initial appropriation for the U.S. Custom House had been for a brick building with wood framing, but Mills designed a solid masonry building. His design demonstrated skill with fireproof construction methods, which remained evident in all of his later federal commissions. The monumental U.S. Custom House is five bays wide and three bays deep, rising two stories above a full basement. The structure has granite-faced, masonry-bearing walls with floors supported by brick groin-vaults and a hipped roof carried by zinc- coated wood trusses. Four chimneys rise from the center of the building enclosing the original rooftop observatory. The dramatic portico dominates the main (east) elevation on North Second Street. This significant feature was excluded from the original contract due to its expense and decorative purpose. The high-style portico, which is characteristic of the Greek Revival style, was part of a second set of construction specifications produced in 1836. It is composed of four slightly tapered Doric order columns, twenty-five feet in height and two feet three inches in diameter. Each column consists of four pieces of stone and supports an enclosed pediment, accentuating the building's wide entablature. The building's modest interior finishes reflect not only the frugality of the federal building program during this period, but also the sparseness of the Greek Revival style. Interior spaces are organized along a central corridor on the first floor. The stair hall runs perpendicular to the south side of the main axis. The main hall is located on the second floor, with offices and storage occupying the remaining portions of the building. Extant interior features original to the building include the groin vaults of the ceiling in the first-floor office spaces, plastered wall surfaces, molded wood service counters, and a built-in measuring device from 1859. Late 19th century wainscoting composed of beaded vertical boards and wide baseboards survive in the first-floor corridor but the original pine flooring is covered with black-and-white marble tiles. The main stair is modestly detailed with stone treads, wood handrail, and square iron balusters. The workmanship that created these stairs was described in 1837 by John L. Sibley in The American Magazine of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge, as \\"not surpassed by any which we have ever seen.\\" In the 1960s the building was extensively restored. The exterior was cleaned, the 2/2 double-hung sash wood windows installed in the 1870s were replaced with 6/6 double-hung wood sashes replicating the original windows, and the mid-nineteenth-century cupola was removed. The exterior of the building was cleaned again in 1981.

Donohue Federal Building and United States Courthouse, formerly known as the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse, is a courthouse of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts located in Worcester, Massachusetts. Building history Established in 1722, Worcester remained a relatively small but prosperous village until the 1835 construction of the Boston & Worcester Railroad. The railroad established the town as an important commercial and industrial hub, and businesses burgeoned. In 1848, as a result of rapid growth, Worcester was incorporated as a city. The earliest postal facilities in Worcester were located in postmasters' homes. In 1897, a post office was constructed on the site of the present building. As Worcester expanded in the twentieth century, it needed a courthouse and federal office space in addition to a larger post office building. Officials decided to construct a single building to meet all of those needs. Disputes arose over the selection of a site that was appropriate for a prominent federal building yet situated in a convenient location within the commercial district. Ultimately, the 1897 post office building was demolished and the site utilized for the current building, which would house the first and only presence of the United States District Court in Worcester. The present building was constructed from 1930 to 1931 with funding made available through the Public Buildings Act of 1926. The design was approved by Louis A. Simon in the Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore. The Murch Brothers Construction Company of St. Louis, Missouri, completed the construction for a cost of $670,000 plus an additional $37,747 for the installation of Otis Elevation Company elevators. The building officially opened in January 1932. In 1987, the building was renamed for Harold D. Donohue, a U.S. Representative and World War II veteran who served in the House from 1947 to 1974. Federal Square, which fronts the northeast elevation of the building, was constructed in 1991. In 1993, the U.S. Post Office left the building and the interior space was reconfigured to accommodate the needs of the court. The building was a regional winner and finalist in the Building Owners and Managers Association's The Office Building of the Year (TOBY) Award for 1996 to 1997. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. Architecture The structure is located on a triangular lot in the southern end of the commercial district in Worcester. It is bounded by Main, Myrtle, and Southbridge streets and is adjacent to Federal Square. The five-story building is a blend of the Classical and Renaissance Revival styles of architecture. The building's design conveys the dignity and stability of the federal government, which was particularly important during the Great Depression. Native New England materials were used to construct the building, which is divided into three horizontal zones: base, midsection, and attic story. The base is clad in West Townsend, Massachusetts, granite laid in ashlar blocks. Middle stories are sheathed in Danby, Vermont, marble. The attic story is distinct and contains bays divided by terra-cotta panels with raised relief motifs bordered by stylized palmettes and inverted waterleaf designs. The attic story is topped by a flat roof. A circular terra-cotta cupola with a colonnade (series of columns) and dome roof sits atop the building. The narrow northeast facade serves as the principal elevation from a design perspective. It contains monumental engaged columns with granite bases, marble shafts, and terra-cotta capitals. Three arches form an arcade. The central keystone in the arch over the entrance is adorned with a scale of justice and a key motif contained within a cartouche (decorative oval). Beneath the roofline, the frieze contains three recurring motifs. A bull's skull surrounded by oak leaves and banderols is followed by a ram's head festooned with fruit and nuts. A corn wreath crowned with an armorial helmet completes the trio. The interior of the building has relatively simple finishes that remain primarily in the courtrooms, judges' chambers, lobbies, stair halls, and corridors. The first-floor elevator and postal lobbies retain many original finishes. Floors are covered with pre-cast orange terrazzo set in pigmented grout with polished Travertine and Vermont marble inlay. The plaster walls have marble wainscot. Brass radiator grilles, bronze writing desks, and an iron grille above the original service entrance remain. The transom area above the opening to the staircase in the west entrance vestibule is adorned with a raised-relief plaster eagle, which conveys the federal presence. The building was renovated between 1972 and 1973. At that time, major mail processing activities moved to a recently completed facility nearby. Hellman-Kempton Associates of Falmouth, Massachusetts, retrofitted the building for new tenants. This work left the building exterior intact, but the interior was reconfigured. The renovation included the replacement of windows; removal of skylights; and installation of new floors, ceilings, light fixtures, plumbing, and wiring. A portion of the west postal lobby and the postal workroom were divided into smaller spaces. Between 1993 and 1995, a lightwell that extended from the second to the fifth stories in the central portion of the building was filled to accommodate additional courtrooms. In 1995, artist Michael Hachey completed a mural to commemorate the case of Quock Walker, an African-American slave who successfully sued for his freedom in a 1783 case that was popularly believed to have abolished slavery in Massachusetts.

He was the son of the writer and scholar Krushnashastri Chiplunkar.  Life  Vishnushastri was born in Pune in a Chitpavan Brahmin family to the Sanskrit scholar Krishnashastri Chiplunkar. He obtained his B.A. from Deccan College, Pune in 1872 and worked as a schoolteacher in government schools during the years 1872-1879. In 1880, he founded (together with Gopal Ganesh Agarkar and Bal Gangadhar Tilak) the newspapers Kesari (‡§ï‡•á‡§∏‡§∞‡•Ä, in Marathi) and Mahratta (in English).He was also a co-founder The New English School in Pune. These institutions intended to provide a more patriotically inclined education as opposed to the schools run by the government in British India. In 1878, Chiplunkar founded another monthly named Kavyetihas Sangraha (‡§ï‡§æ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§§‡§ø‡§π‡§æ‡§∏ ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§π) with the objective of better familiarizing the readers with the poetry and history of Maharashtra. The same year he established two printing presses, namely Aryabhushan Press (‡§Ü‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§≠‡•Ç‡§∑‡§£ ‡§õ‡§æ‡§™‡§ñ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ) and Chitrashala (‡§ö‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§∂‡§æ‡§≥‡§æ) press, the latter for the purpose of printing pictures of historical and spiritual figures and deities in Maharashtra.The next year, he opened a bookshop named Kitabkhana (‡§ï‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§¨‡§ñ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ), with the objective of making available inspirational books to Marathi readers. He died in Pune of typhoid at an early age of 32 in 1882. An early biography was written by his brother Lakshmanshastri Chiplunkar , and a later appraisal of his career by Madkholkar .  Writings  His career as a writer began in 1868, with his articles in the periodical Shalapatrak (‡§∂‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§™‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§ï, The School Paper) founded by his father. Notable in this period are the critical appraisals of the Sanskrit poets Kalidas, Bhavabhuti, Bana, Subandhu and Dandin. These articles introduced his readers to the 'Western' tradition of literary criticism. They were later republished as Sanskrit Kavipanchak (‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§§ ‡§ï‡§µ‡§ø‡§™‡§Ç‡§ö‡§ï ). Eventually he became the editor of this periodical, however some of his articles criticizing the conduct of the British Government and Christian Missionaries proved controversial, and the ensuing repercussions forced the closure of Shalapatrak in 1875. In 1874, he started the monthly Nibandhamala (‡§®‡§ø‡§¨‡§Ç‡§ß‡§Æ‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ, A Garland of Essays) for which he is principally remembered. Nearly all of the writing in the 84 issues of this periodical published in 12 years is due to him. His range is wide, and includes subjects such as the contemporary status of the Marathi language contrasted with that of English, Sanskrit and Marathi poetry, and the propriety of using foreign words in Marathi. Aamachya Deshachi Sthiti (‡§Ö‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ö‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂‡§æ‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§§‡•Ä, The state of our nation) and Mudranasvatantrya (‡§Æ‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§£‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§§‡§Ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø, Freedom of the press) are two of his influential political articles. He also translated the following works into Marathi in cooperation with his father: *Rasselas by Samuel Johnson *Kadambari by Banabhatta *The Arabian Nights (loosely following the translation into English by Edward Lane) A compilation of his selected writings has been edited by Buddhisagar . Vishnushastri's Marathi prose style was moulded on the one hand by his knowledge of Sanskrit, and on the other by his extensive reading into the works of Samuel Johnson, Addison and Macaulay. His writing is characteristic of what is usually called the ‡§Ö‡§µ‡•ç‡§µ‡§≤ ‡§á‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§ú‡•Ä (high English) period, when Marathi written syntax shows the heavy influence of long, complex sentences incorporating several subordinate clauses, prevalent in 18th and 19th century English. He is also commonly referred to as the Shivaji of the Marathi language. However, this honorific description was first applied to Vishnushastri by himself, and in fact, was spoken by him in English. In popular culture In the Marathi film Lokmanya: Ek Yug Purush on the life of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Om Raut plays the character of Vishnushastrii.

History The facility has a colorful history intertwined with notable Americans. The property successively served as a sanitarium, military hospital, and offices. The center consists of 22 buildings on 24 acres, all of which were recently added to the National Register of Historic Places. The Hart-Dole-Inouye Federal Center is among one hundred properties featured in the General Service Administration's Public Buildings Heritage Program. Western Health Reform Institute In 1866 the Seventh-day Adventists established the Western Health Reform Institute on eight acres of land, the former residence of Benjamin Graves, a judge of the Michigan Superior Court. H. S. Lay, the first physician in charge, and James and Ellen White, early founders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, were instrumental in founding this health institution. The goals of the institution were to teach the Adventists' version of holistic medicine, which stressed the importance of temperance and preventive medicine, taking in visitors and advocating the use of Graham bread and counseling eight hours of sleep at night. From this farmhouse the institution struggled to live up to its name but there were ideas and propositions for a building that would lead to a worldwide reputation. Battle Creek Sanitarium In 1876, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, medical director, renamed the property and expanded the facility to include a hospital, central building, and other cottages. Much of the original sanitarium burned down in 1902. A large building by architect Frank Mills Andrews opened in 1903 at a cost of $1 million and was considered a marvel of modern planning and medical technology. Under Kellogg's auspices, the sanitarium expanded, and a tower addition was completed in 1928. The tide turned, however, in 1929 when the economy collapsed and the nation entered into the depression. Within four years, the sanitarium had gone into receivership. Percy Jones Army Hospital Postcard from hospital era With the outbreak of World War II, local builder Floyd Skidmore proposed that the near-vacant sanitarium be converted into a military hospital. Upon this recommendation, in August 1942, the United States Army bought the buildings for $2.25 million and FJ Skidmore & Son rebuilt the derelict structure in six months (working around the clock), enlarging the capacity of the hospital from 1,000 beds to 1,500, and constructing rails and ramps throughout the facility.\\"SERVING OUR WW II AND KOREAN WAR VETERANS\\" , Defense Logistics Agency, Disposition Services On Feb. 22, 1943, the hospital was officially dedicated by its first commander, Colonel Norman T. Kirk. He was the former chief of surgical services at Walter Reed General Hospital in Washington, D.C. The new hospital was named after Colonel Percy L. Jones, US Army, a pioneering military surgeon who developed modern battlefield ambulance evacuation. The hospital grew as the flow of casualties increased. In 1944, W.K. Kellogg donated his mansion on nearby Gull Lake to the Army, which assigned it to Percy Jones as a convalescent center. The Fort Custer Reception Center was also used by Percy Jones for patients on ‚Äúcasual duty.‚Äù The Percy Jones hospital complex was massive, self-contained, and fully integrated. It had its own water supply and power generation. It also had its own bank, post office, public library and radio station \\"KPJ\\". The Percy Jones Institute was an accredited high school, with dozens of educational and training programs for patients ranging from photography to business to agriculture. At the height of the war, more than two thousand people visited the hospital on a daily basis, including celebrities such as Bob Hope, Jimmy Stewart, Ed Sullivan, Gene Autry, and Roy Rogers. In 1945, Percy Jones became the largest medical installation of any kind in the world. Following V-J Day (victory over Japan) in 1945, the hospital population peaked with 11,427 patients assigned to its three area sites. Percy Jones specialized as an Army center for neurosurgery, amputations and handicapped rehabilitation, deep x-ray therapy and plastic artificial eyes. In one month alone, 729 operations were performed. After a short deactivation period, the hospital reopened only a few days after hostilities broke out in Korea in the summer of 1950. In 1951, about 1,000 patients were at Percy Jones, many of them with frostbite caused by the bone- chilling Korean weather. In 1954, after treating more than 100,000 patients, the Percy Jones Hospital was permanently closed and the building was placed under the control of the General Services Administration. In the decade it was open, the hospital made a lasting impact on the city. Battle Creek was the first city in America to install wheelchair ramps in its sidewalks, to accommodate the Percy Jones patients when they visited downtown. Battle Creek Federal Center  In 1954, the GSA moved the National Federal Civil Defense Administration (from Washington D.C.) and the Staff College of the National Civil Defense Training Agency (from Olney, Maryland) to the retired hospital in Battle Creek. The facility was again rebuilt to prepare it for atomic attack. The civil defense operations at the facility included coordinating government and private technical services, volunteer and shelter deployment, public education, and emergency communications. In recognition of the facility's new purpose, the building was renamed the Battle Creek Federal Center. Five years later, in 1959, the GSA began using facility space for other federal organizations, and by 1962, twenty-eight different agencies were housed there. The Office for Civil Defense was moved from the Battle Creek Federal Center in late 1962 and the Sixth Corps of the U.S. Fifth Army and Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) were transferred in. Currently, the Defense Logistics Agency (Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) and Systems Integration Office (DSIO-J)) remains as the principal tenant of the Hart-Dole-Inouye Federal Center, along with the DLA Disposition Services, and the Air Force Cataloging and Standardization Center (CASC). Hart-Dole- Inouye Federal Center In 2003, the building was re-dedicated as the Hart- Dole-Inouye Federal Center in honor of three U.S. senators who had met as wounded servicemen while they were being treated at the hospital during WWII: Philip Hart of Michigan, who had been wounded during the Normandy Landings at Utah Beach on D-Day, Bob Dole of Kansas, who was wounded in combat over Italy, and Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, who had been wounded while engaged in combat in Italy. Architecture The Center includes 21 buildings on 24 acres. Building types include offices, a power plant, workshops, and storage buildings. The main 1903 sanitarium building has a rectangular footprint with three wings radiating out from the main block. It is now referred to as Building 2, with the wings designated as Buildings 2A, 2B, and 2C. It is designed in the Italian Renaissance Revival style, which was commonly used for academic buildings in the early twentieth century. This was a logical choice for the sanitarium since Kellogg sought to educate his patients in the ways of healthy living. The facade is composed of buff-colored brick with decorative details such as piers, belt courses, and quoins (corner blocks) executed in gray brick. Decorative pediments (triangular gables) are above entrances. Concrete columns mark the main entrance bay and are topped with plaster Ionic (scrolled) capitals. Arched openings form loggias, which are roofed spaces with open sides. The monumental building occupies a high point in the city and was originally five stories in height, with a compatibly designed sixth story added in 1920. Despite the changes in use, the building's exterior has not been altered substantially. The first-floor lobby has an ornate plaster ceiling. The east wall of the lobby contains a tripartite leadedglass window; the center portion bears the inscription \\"He is Thy Life.\\" The stairway to the mezzanine has a cast-iron balustrade with a wood railing and marble steps. The newel post contains classically inspired ornamentation appropriate to the building style. The sixth-floor lobby contains four murals painted by J. J. Haidt in 1922. They are located on the coved ceiling and depict serene landscape scenes in pastel colors. Other interior spaces have changed dramatically. The solarium, gymnasium, and swimming pool have been demolished. The most prominent feature of the complex is the 15-story tower that was added to the south side of Building 2 in 1928. The tower, currently designated as Building 1, was designed to complement the existing main sanitarium building. The exterior remains unchanged and is clad in stone and different shades of brick. The facade is dominated by a two-story colonnade with 32 Ionic columns. Porte cochere pavilions are located at each end of the colonnade. The tower originally contained more than 265 hotel-like guest rooms and suites, most of which had private bathrooms. These spaces have been altered to accommodate government offices. The luxurious two-story lobby of the tower has twelve massive marble columns with imported Italian marble bases. The columns are topped with Corinthian capitals that feature acanthus leaf designs. The ceiling in the lobby is coffered (recessed) and detailed with floral motifs executed in rich colors. The lobby walls are covered with pink-gold marble, and gold chandeliers illuminate the space. Tall windows open to the colonnade. Building 1A was originally the sanitarium's lavish dining room. It retains many original features including large chandeliers and murals of Oriental scenes. Draperies, doors, and decorative moldings have been restored. The room retains much of its original character and serves as a cafeteria today.

It is a courthouse of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. Building history The Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in Port Huron, Michigan, is located on the south side of the Black River in the central business district. It has the distinction of being the oldest federal building in the State of Michigan still occupied by the federal government; it was built to house some of the government's oldest agencies. In 1872, Congress authorized construction of a building to house the U.S. Customs Service, a post office, and other federal agencies in Port Huron. Alfred B. Mullett, supervising architect of the U.S. Treasury Department, designed the building. Construction began in 1873, and the cornerstone was laid on October 8, 1874. It was completed in 1877 at a cost of $200,000, with tenants occupying their new building in May of that year. In 1916, a classical fountain that originally stood in front of the building was replaced with a war memorial. In 1930, Congress appropriated $115,000 for an addition to the building. The Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore, oversaw design of the one-story addition. Construction of the addition was completed in 1933. In 1959‚Äì1960, the post office vacated the building and, at a cost of $250,000, the first floor was renovated to house the Social Security Administration. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Federal courts continue to occupy the building's second floor. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs Customs and Border Protection maintains offices in the building. Architecture left The three- story Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse is an example of Renaissance Revival style with Greek Revival influences. The load-bearing exterior walls are built of limestone at the ground level and sandstone on the upper three stories. Constructed in 1873‚Äì1877, the original portion of the building has front and rear (north and south) elevations divided into nine bays, while the east and west sides contain five bays. The north and south elevations are highlighted by centered three-bay pavilions topped by pediments with dentil- block molding. The north facade originally contained three entrances, but only the center entrance remains, and the flanking entries have been converted into windows. The entry has a half-glass door with sidelights and a square transom, with historic light fixtures to either side. The first- and second-story windows are rectangular, while the third-story windows are smaller and square. Both the window and door openings are trimmed with flat stone arches detailed with egg-and-dart carvings. A sandstone water table caps the foundation wall. Deeply cut pilasters define the bays on the first story and terminate in Doric capitals at a flat entablature that forms a belt course between the first and second stories. On the second and third stories, the pilasters rise to the base of the low-pitched roof and terminate in simplified Corinthian order capitals. A cornice composed of stone brackets and dentils sits atop the pilasters. The building is topped by an octagonal cupola pierced by windows flanked by engaged pilasters and topped with bracketed pediments. The copper- clad mansard roof features oval windows accented with decorative stone surrounds with keystones. In 1986‚Äì1987, a $1.15 million exterior restoration and copper roofing project was completed. The interior features an original cast-iron staircase adjacent to the eastern entrance. It is highlighted by a continuous iron balustrade with a wooden railing and decorative newel posts. The original postal lobby, once stretching the length of the building along the north facade, was completely removed by 1959‚Äì1960 renovation work, but was restored in 2008 under the First Impressions Initiative of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA). The initiative uses historic building outlease funds to reclaim the architectural integrity of altered entrances and lobbies. Utilizing historic photos, GSA recreated the original lobby volume, architectural details, and ornamentation, reestablishing the building as a community landmark. On upper stories, the stair lobbies open to corridors leading to offices and courtrooms. The corridors retain wood wainscoting, moldings, and trim with classical details around the doors and windows. Crown molding extends along the ceiling. The remaining interior spaces of the original building and addition have been renovated over the years to accommodate new office uses. The materials and design of the one-story rear addition, built in 1932‚Äì1933, generally match the original building. The west elevation continues the rusticated pilasters and projecting belt course, but is terminated by a flat, stone parapet at the second-story level.

In 1965, she was transferred to the Republic of China Navy and served as ROCS Fu Shan (PF-35) until 1996. Afterwards, she was scrapped. History Construction and commissioning Truxtun was laid down as the Rudderow-class destroyer escort USS Truxtun (DE-282) on 13 December 1943 by the Charleston Navy Yard and was launched on 9 March 1944, sponsored by Miss Norton Truxtun. The ship was reclassified as a Crosley-class high-speed transport and redesignated APD-98 on 15 July 1944. After conversion to her new role, she was commissioned on 9 July 1945 with Lieutenant Commander Paul A. Bane, USNR, in command. U.S. Navy (1945-1946) Truxtun departed Charleston on 24 July 1945 for shakedown training in the vicinity of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, until 25 August 1945, ten days after the end of World War II. On 28 August 1945, she entered Norfolk, Virginia, for post-shakedown shipyard availability. On 10 September 1945, she cleared Hampton Roads, Virginia, for a two-week, round-trip voyage to Miami, Florida. Returning to Norfolk late in September 1945, Truxtun prepared for inactivation. On 9 November 1945, she again headed for Florida, this time bound for the Atlantic Reserve Fleet berthing area at Green Cove Springs, Florida. Arriving there on 16 November 1945, she completed preparations for inactivation. Truxtun was decommissioned on 15 March 1946. She spent the remainder of her U.S. Navy career in reserve at Green Cove Springs until 1961, then at Orange, Texas. On 24 June 1963, Truxtuns name was cancelled in order that it might be assigned to the new guided-missile frigate USS Truxtun (DLGN-35). For the 18 months remaining in her U.S. Navy career, she was identified simply as USS APD-98.

Completed in 1930, it is part of the Duluth Civic Center Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. In 2007 the United States Congress passed an act to rename the building for former Circuit Court judge Gerald Heaney.Remarks of James Oberstar, \\"Debate on H.R. 187\\", Congressional Record- House, February 7, 2007, pp. H1299-H1300.

Building history Duluth was a small copper mining town until 1869, when it became the railhead for the first transcontinental railway. Its proximity to Lake Superior made it an excellent location for shipping grain. Located near large forested areas, Duluth's sawmills thrived by the end of the nineteenth century, and the city became the nation's fifth busiest seaport. In 1892, the city's first federal building‚Äîa post office, courthouse, and custom house‚Äîwas constructed.General Services Administration page on the Gerald W. Heaney Federal Building, United States Courthouse and Custom House. As the city continued to expand, officials decided to create a civic center and in 1907 invited prominent architect and planner Daniel H. Burnham to develop a plan that would include a new county courthouse, city hall, custom house, federal office building, and plaza. A pioneer in city planning, Burnham was responsible for the layout of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, as well as city plans for Chicago and San Francisco. His plans emphasized the relationship between buildings and their sites. Burnham's design for Duluth, which the city commissioners unanimously endorsed in 1908, incorporated components of the City Beautiful movement, which espoused the use of formal arrangements, axial streets, and monumental, classical public buildings in city planning. The county courthouse and city hall were constructed first. In 1916, the federal government purchased a site within the civic center for the construction of the new federal building. The U.S. Post Office, Courthouse and Custom House was designed in 1928 by Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore, after Congress approved a $1.2 million appropriation. Construction commenced the following year and was completed in 1930. The building has undergone several renovations. In 1970, the post office vacated the building for a new location, and the first floor was insensitively altered. The building name was changed to the Federal Building, U.S. Courthouse and Custom House at that time. In 2005, as part of the First Impressions program, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) restored historic components of the building that were removed or compromised during earlier modifications. Architecture The building is located on the west side of the Duluth Civic Center. Designed in the Renaissance Revival style of architecture, the building is compatible with the other buildings that form the Duluth Civic Center Historic District. The Renaissance Revival style was commonly selected for prominent public buildings because it conveyed the dignity of the government. The building displays many classical elements such as a balustrade, columns, symmetry, and classical motifs, including medallions and dentils (square blocks) that define the Renaissance Revival style. The Federal Building, U.S. Courthouse and Custom House was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Duluth Civic Center Historic District in 1986. The building is faced with polished granite and has a terra-cotta cornice. A flight of granite stairs with granite abutments leads to the first level of the building. A terrace enclosed by a classical balustrade encircles the building. The first story features rusticated granite with tall round-arch openings topped with scrolled keystones. Small, rectangular paired windows are above the arches. The upper stories, which are defined by a string-course and faced with smooth, ashlar blocks of granite, are dominated by two-story engaged Doric columns that separate large windows. These simple columns indicate the location of interior courtroom spaces. Cast-iron spandrels separate the windows, and carved granite spandrels with eagle motifs are located at each end of the facade. Each column is topped with a medallion. Above the columns, the terra-cotta cornice features a dentil course and decorative anthemia (honeysuckle or palm leaf ornaments) at the roofline. The interior of the first floor contains public spaces that retain many original finishes and features. The floor of the main lobby is covered with light orange quarry tile with green marble borders. The walls are faced with Mankato stone and feature ornamental grilles. The public lobby floor is covered with Tennessee marble with green marble borders. Mankato stone also covers these walls. The plaster ceiling has ornamental vents and brackets, and original light fixtures are found on both the walls and the ceiling. The post office lobby is adjacent to the main lobby and contains similar flooring materials. The baseboard, wainscot, and counters are white marble with gold veins. The walls have wood trim and Mankato stone piers. The paneled plaster ceiling and decorative brackets remain in place, as do original lighting fixtures and bronze postal boxes. The fourth floor contains three courtrooms that are very similar in appearance and retain many historic components. Covered with panasote, a type of artificial leather, doors feature bronze brads and kick plates. Walls are clad in sound-absorbing artificial stone that is an original material. Paired pilasters (attached columns) with Corinthian capitals dominate the wall behind the judge's bench. White marble with gold veins is used for door surrounds, baseboards, and on the steps to the judges' platforms. Original light fixtures descend from the ceilings. Tall, arched windows and large, rectangular skylights bordered in a geometric pattern also illuminate the courtrooms. As part of the 2005 restoration, GSA recreated historic elements including the original post office window. Portions of the elevator lobbies were redesigned to be more historically accurate.

Design The MAUL is a shotgun based on Metal Storm's electronically initiated superposed-load technology. In this concept multiple projectiles, in this case of 12-gauge bore, are loaded nose to tail in a single gun barrel with propellant packed between them. Each projectile is ignited sequentially using an electrically fired primer: the electrical charge is provided by a battery. The weapon fires once per trigger pull: while in effect this is semi-automatic, in strict terms it is not as no energy from firing is used to automate any part of the weapon's operating cycle. Designed to be used as either a standalone weapon or an underslung module of a combat rifle such as M4 or M16 via the use of Picatinny rail, it can also be used in a standalone configuration through the addition of a pistol grip, folding stock or both. The central module is made of carbon fiber, while the barrels are steel. The resulting weapon weighs less than ,. In its underslung configuration, it was boresight-aligned to the host gun's sighting system. It was intended to fire a range of loads; buckshot, slug, Door breaching slugs, and several kinds of less-lethal loads including blunt-force, electro-muscular incapacitation and frangible nose chemical and marker munitions. Loads were intended to be provided in their own munition tubes, with the operator switching tubes to change ammunition type.

History The polled variety of the Wiltshire Horn sheep was developed in Australia to create a polled variety of the easy-care Wiltshire Horn sheep suitable for heavy lamb production. In 1996, the breed association was formed, and it has expanded rapidly.Stephens, M (et al.), Handbook of Australian Livestock, Australian Meat & Livestock Export Corporation, 2000 (4th ed.), Characteristics Wiltipolls are large, easy- care, plain-bodied sheep that shed their wool annually. They do not require crutching or shearing and do not suffer readily from fly strike, which makes them a useful breed for small holdings without shearing sheds. These sheep must have at least 96.87% Wiltshire Horn genetics, completely shed their fleece annually, and be polled. The ewes are seasonal breeders, but are good mothers, have high fertility with a high percentage of multiple births. Wiltipoll sheep may weigh up to under reasonable conditions. Wiltipoll sheep (polled Wiltshire Horn) shed their wool annually in spring to summer and produce lean, heavy lambs. They are a polled breed (no horns) bred for the production of prime lamb. The wool is simply shed and falls to the ground. Due to this process, the energy of the sheep is directed into meat and milk, not wool. The breed is, therefore, very low maintenance as it has no need for shearing, crutching, mulesing, jetting, dipping, and docking of tails. The Wiltipoll is grass seed-resistant and fly- and lice-resistant, reducing the need for chemicals or the painful practice of mulesing. All this equates to less expense and less work. Wiltipolls have a high lambing percentage of 130-180% and good maternal instincts. They are renowned for twins and triplets. This requires fewer ewes to manage and feed with more prime lamb to sell. They produce prime lambs without laying down fat, thus producing a very lean, high-quality meat. As the Wiltipoll are polled, the sheep are easier to handle and less bruising occurs. Wiltipolls ideally suit small acreage holders and also those farmers who can not continue with the workload associated with wool breeds. This breed is very hardy and can survive on rough, scrubby feed.

Background Born in Calcutta, he was the oldest son of John Petty Ward and his wife Eleanor Erskine, daughter of John Erskine. He was educated at Royal Military Academy, Woolwich and joined then the Royal Engineers as cadet in 1841.  Career  Shortly after his admission, he got a promotion to second lieutenant and then in 1844 to first lieutenant. After additional studies at the Royal School of Mines, he began working for the Royal Mint and became second captain in 1852. Two years later, Ward was sent as deputy-master of its oversea branch to Sydney and was promoted to captain in 1855. In May of the latter year, he was nominated a non-elective member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, sitting in it for nine months. He was appointed to the council for life in 1861, however resigned his seat in 1865. Ward was promoted to major in January 1964 and to lieutenant-colonel only few months later. When he returned to England in 1866, he was set on halfpay. In 1869, he became colonel and resumed his old post as deputy-master in a new branch in Melbourne. He was awarded a Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1874 and retired with a pension three years later, having been promoted to major-general. In 1879, he was further honoured as a Knight Commander. Ward played for the New South Wales cricket team in four of its early matches against Victoria between 1857 and 1862. He was one of the pioneers of roundarm bowling in Australia and was most effective, taking 27 wickets in his four matches at an average of 7.66.A. G. Moyes, Australian Cricket: A History, Angus & Robertson, Sydney, 1959, p. 118. In the match against Victoria in 1858-59 he took 10 wickets for 57 runs.

Seven holy cities The Seven tirthas are: * Ayodhya (Ayodhya Puri), * Mathura (Madhura Puri), * Haridwar (Maya Puri), * Varanasi (Kashi Puri), * Kanchipuram (Kanchi Puri), * Ujjain (Avantika Puri), * Dwarka (Dwaraka Puri) History The Sapta Puri are places of birth of religious and spiritual masters, places where gods have descended as avatars (incarnations) such as Ayodhya where Rama was born, and places considered as Nitya tirthas, naturally endowed, with spiritual powers since ages such as Varanasi and Haridwar. Kanchipuram is known for its Kamakshi Amman Temple dedicated to the mother goddess. Dwarka represents the place where god Krishna, after leaving Mathura spent 100 years before He left for his divine abode from here, according to the epic Mahabharata. Mathura is the embodiment of events in the life of Krishna during his childhood and young days. Haridwar with shrines of both Shiva and Vishnu, represents the gateway to Uttarakhand, as the sacred river Ganges emerges from the hills into the plains at this place. Varanasi is the place of salvation as it is strongly believed that death at this place will bring salvation. Varanasi is the holiest of all and it is favorite to lord Shiva, thus it is often referred as City of Lord Shiva. In Hinduism, one should visit the major temples in Varanasi in his/her life. Ujjain, also known by the ancient name Avanti, has one of the 12 Jyotirlingas installed in the Mahakaleshwar Temple. Each of these cities is also famous for the spectacular melas or fairs held. Haridwar and Ujjain are famous for the Kumbh Mela held once every 12 years. Marriage festival of Kamakshi at Kanchipuram is a special occasion. Krishna Janmashtami ( birth day of Krishna - generally held in August as per Hindu calendar) is a special occasion in Dwarka and Mathura. The seven religious cities are within India's territorial ambit and pilgrimage to these places greatly enhances the unity of the nation, in spite of its linguistic and cultural diversity. The seven sacred urban centers are well connected by road, rail and air transport with the rest of the country. Ayodhya A view of Ayodhya in 1783 then called Oudh, Utter pradesh Ayodhya () is the legendary place where god Rama was born and it is also sometimes referred to as Ram Janmabhoomi (\\"Rama's birth place\\"). The modern town is located on the banks of river Sarayu, also spelt Saryu. There is a surfeit of temples in this town, numbering over 100. Some of the important ones are: Temple of Rama and his wife Sita, called the Kanak Bhavan; Hanuman temple called the Hanuman Garhi on top of a hill where, apart from a Hanuman statue in a sitting posture, there is also a tall image of Hanuman always bedecked by flowers; the Kshireshwaranath temple of Sita, established by Kausalya, Rama's mother. In addition, there are several kunds or ponds and ghats (bathing steps to approach river or tank water level) with linkage to mythological characters; such as the Brahma kund built in honour of Brahma's visit here, Sita kund, Bharat kund, Lakshman ghat where Lakshman, Rama's brother took bath, Rama ghat (also called Swargadwar meaning gateway to heaven). There is a legend related to Kusha, son of Rama, in support of the Nageshwaranath temple here. The armlet, which Kusha had lost in the Sarayu river was found by a nag- kanya (a damsel of the serpent family), a devotee of god Shiva, who fell in love with Kusha. A temple was built by Kusha in her honour and is stated to be the only surviving ancient temple dated to the reign of Vikramaditya.Bansal p.39 The historic legacy of this place is traced to sixth century BC, as established by archaeological and literary references. Ramayana epic is traced to late centuries of BC of the Ikshvaku Dynasty and early centuries of AD. Dasaratha, father of Rama belonged to this dynasty. It is also the place where the Babri Masjid was built by the Mughals in the 16th century (since destroyed in 1992), which has been described in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 1986 edition as: \\"Rama‚Äôs birthplace, is marked by a mosque, erected by the Moghul emperor Babar in 1528 on the site of an earlier temple\\".15th edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1986, entry \\"Ayodhya\\", Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc. Supreme Court of India ruled in November 2019 that Ram Mandir should be built on this site as this was the birth place of Lord Ram. Road distances from Ayodhya to Delhi is , to Lucknow and to Varanasi . Mathura Kansa, the evil king of Mathura, at Mathura. Mathura (), Utter pradesh located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in the district headquarters of Mathura district, also called Mathura Mandala or Braj Bhoomi, is considered the heart of Indian culture. Krishna was born here and hence it is also popularly known as 'Krishnajanmabhoomi' (\\"Krishna's birth place\\").p. 2 Mathura is replete with several historic events. Based on archeological findings of ancient pottery, tools and tackles, Mathura's ancient history has been traced to about 1200 BC. Vedic and Puranic literature also link founding of Mathura by Shatrughna (youngest brother of Rama). The Puranas also mention about two clans namely, Andhaka and Vrsni, the later clan was more organized under Krishna, attesting to historic linkage to the period between sixth century and fifth century BC. Mauryan empire's influence from the fourth century BC, when there was domination of Jain and Buddhist religious culture, have been noted from the sculptures recorded in Mathura. From this period, it has been inferred that \\"the city had a significant impact on the development of figurative sculpture elsewhere in the country\\". It was also a commercial hub during this period, imbibing composite culture and religious ethos, apart from establishing a prospering commerce both within and across the borders of the region. Following the Mauryan rule, the Kushans ruled till 3rd century AD when the sacred and secular life styles coalesced. Then a number of rulers followed, with the Gupta empire under Samudra Gupta ruling between 330 AD and 380 AD. During the Gupta empire, which lasted till sixth century AD, there was decline in the prosperity of Mathura. The Huns sacked the city in the sixth century. Thereafter, the city was controlled by Maukhari Dynasty of Kanauj when the Krishna cult evolved from the 7th century onwards to make the city a hub of Krishna worship in the country. Then Mahmud of Ghazni invaded and ransacked Mathura and decamped with all religious treasures made of gold and silver. This was followed by ushering in the rule of Slave Dynasty or Delhi Sultanate from 1193 AD and subsequently by the Mughal Dynasty rule, which lasted till the British took over. The Mughal rule, in particular of Aurangzeb saw the highest level of persecution, when in 1669 the Keshava temple was demolished and in its place a mosque was built. Even though the jat community of the region tried unsuccessfully to restore some of the temples but repeated Muslim depredation continued and it was not until the British Raj came into effect, after the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857, that Krishna worship in Mathura got a reprieve. British archeologists were successful in recreating the ancient historicity of the city and providing insight to Indian culture. Krishna temples and ancient history are now both major attractions of the city.Ring p.572-57 The present Keshav Dev Temple has been built at the same location where several major temples had been built in the 5000 years of hoary past, which is traced to the Vajranabha, the great grandson of Krishna. A grand temple was rebuilt during the reign of Chandra Gupta Vikramaditya in the 5th century that was sacked by Mahmud of Ghazni. Thereafter, at the same location Raja Veer Singh Deva Bundela had built a high temple during Jahangir's reign, which was also destroyed by Aurangzeb in 1669 and a mosque built in its place, which can be seen adjoining the present temple. The present temple (see picture in infobox) was completed in 1958 with installation of images of Radha Krishna. In the adjoining altars several images have been installed; on the left altar images of Jagannath (a form of Krishna), Balarama (Krishna's brother) and Subhadra (Krishna's sister) are seen; on the right altar idols of Rama, Sita and Lakshman are installed, right across there is a Hanuman idol. Images of Shiva and goddess Durga are also seen within the main temple foyer. The main temple complex also has a small shrine where Krishna was born (said to be the prison where he was born) depicting images of Vasudeva, Devaki and four-armed Krishna.Bansal p.40-43 On the bank of the Yamuna River, at Vishrama ghat aarti is offered every evening to the river, since it is stated to be the location where Krishna rested after slaying King Kamsa, his maternal uncle. Images of goddess Yamuna and her brother Yama, the god of death, are also located here. There are many other temples of importance to pilgrims within Mathura, to name only a few, such as the Prem Mandir Vrindavan, Govindji temple, Madan Mohan temple, Radha Damodar temple, Radha Gopinath temple, Banke Bihari temple, Krishna Balarama temple, Rangaji temple and Seva Kunja. Also, in the nearby Vrindavan where Krishna spent his childhood days, there is a galaxy of temples (said to be 5000), which is also a very pious place for pilgrims. It is away from Mathura. Other important religious events observed by pilgrims in the precincts of Mathura and Vrindavan are the Vrindavan Parikrama (religious practice) (circumambulation around the temples along a prescribed path) and the Braj Mandal parikrama during October‚ÄìNovember, which takes 3 months to complete on foot, as it includes going round the Govardhan hill, apart from several other shrines. It is located about north of Agra, and south of Delhi; about from holy Vrindavan. Haridwar Har-ki-Pauri at Haridwar \\"Haridwar\\", also written as \\"Hardwar\\", literally means \\"gateway to god Vishnu (Hari)\\" or \\"gateway to god Shiva (Har)\\". It is the holiest city in the state of Uttarakhand. It is strategically located () on the western bank of the river Ganges as it emerges into the plains at the exact location where the Har-Ki-Pauri ghat has been built to facilitate pilgrims to take a holy bath. It is thus also called the Gangadwara, the place where the Ganges descends to the plains. Every year, thousands of people flock to Haridwar, also called Hardwar, to bathe at the Har-Ki-Pauri ghat (ghat is an embankment structure built out of stone slabs leading to the river edge to facilitate bathing) since it is believed that the feet of Vishnu is imprinted on a rock preserved here. Every evening at sun set time at the ghat, thousands of pilgrims offer arti, a Hindu ritual of offering lights of earthen lamps on small floating leaf holders with flowers, as the temple bells reverberate amidst chanting of hymns.Bansal p.44-47 Legend from Hindu scriptures state that Haridwar is one among the four sites where drops of Amrita, the elixir of immortality, accidentally spilled over from the pitcher, in which it was being carried away by the celestial bird Garuda, after the Samudra manthan (churning of the ocean); the other three places are said to be Ujjain, Nasik, and Allahabad. Another legend narrated for this pilgrim place is that sage Kapila had cursed the ancestors of prince Bhagiratha. Bhagiratha, therefore, wanted to atone for their sins by performing penance to god Shiva here. Shiva pleased with the prayers of Bhagiratha, allowed the Ganges to trickle through his locks and fall on earth from heaven. It is from here that the Ganges emerging out of the Shivalik hills of the Rudra-Himalayas travels a distance of through the fertile Gangetic plains of North India. It is also the site where the river has been tapped for beneficial uses of irrigation and hydro-power generation by a complex system of barrages (low gated weirs) with large canal systems. Its hoary history, closely spun around the epic Mahabharata (also substantiated in the travelogues of the Chinese chronicler Hiuen Tsang), records that Timurlane had ransacked this town in the year 1399 AD. Apart from the holy ghat, there are a large number of temples in the city dedicated to Shiva, goddess Shakti or Durga (a cable car way has been built to approach this temple, apart from the ancient approach by steps over the hills), Vishnu and a galaxy of other deities. It is the pious location where, Hindus from all parts of the country, particularly North India, immerse ashes of the dead and perform last rites. Apart from the regular annual pilgrimage season from April to November, during February‚ÄìMarch Magh Mela ('mela' means \\"fair\\") is also held on a large scale. Other spectacular events that are held here are the Ardh Kumbha Mela (half Kumbh Mela) held every six years. The 12 years cycle Kumbh Mela is held during January or February depending on the Hindu Calmanac. It is the occasion when lakhs of people congregate here for a holy dip in the Ganges. The Kumbh Mela (literal meaning is ('festival of pots') is the \\"confluence of faith\\" since lakhs of people irrespective of their caste affiliations attend it. Astrological combination of planets decide the date for the event; generally when Jupiter, Sun and Moon are in the same zodiacal sign of the Aquarius, but in Haridwar it is fixed when Sun is in Aries and Jupiter in Aquarius, which is called the 'Vaishaki snan' (Vaishakha is the second month of Hindu calendar and snan means bathing). A lyrical poetic expression of the place by Mavis Jones, which succinctly describes the environment and the religiosity of the pilgrims is quoted below. A green so light, not jade, not sky. Ice water rushed out of the Himalayan silence into this wide scarred channel. Along the other shore ashrams are seashell-coloured, beige, cream, coral, sea green. The pilgrims who wash on the flooded steps emerge new from the sacred waters. They are transfigured in scarlet, saffron, emerald. Even the birds are blessed with such colour. The kingfisher is as royal as any prince his gazi a white-fronted waterhen in grey and russet. Now the song rich as honey, of the black-headed oriole calling pilgrims out of the dry land. This benediction of water, overflowing. As many gods are here, as many devotees as specks of sun-lit dust rising from a cremation ghat. Haridwar is at a road distance of from Delhi, the capital of the nation, and from Dehradun, the state capital of Uttarakhand. Varanasi Famous Dashashwamedh Ghat Festival of the Ganges River worship by arti at Dashashwamedh Ghat, Utter pradesh Varanasi () also called Kashi, Benares, is an ancient city, said to be the oldest inhabited one. The city was known by several names such as Avimuktaka, Anandakanana, Mahasmasana, Surandhana, Brahma Vardha, Sudarsana, and Ramya. In view of its ancient historic, cultural and religious heritage it is considered as ‚Äúthe most holy of the seven sacred cities of Hinduism‚Äù. Its historical and religious legacy dates to the Budhha period (6th Century BC) and has been the centre of religious ‚ÄúBrahminical learning‚Äù with sages, philosophers, writers and musicians making it their home in the past several centuries. But much of its temple glory was subject to plundering and destruction by Mohammad Ghauri in the 12th century. The temples and religious institutions seen now in the city are mostly of the 18th century vintage. The temples and the bathing ghats (ghats are embankments made in steps of stone slabs along the river bank where pilgrims perform ritual ablutions) are located on the left west bank of the holy Ganges river and the count of temples in the city is claimed to be 23,000 and the bathing ghats number 81. The most venerated and frequented ghats for devotional worship by the pilgrims are the Manikarnika Ghat, Harishchandra Ghat, Dashashwamedh Ghat (pictured), Assi Ghat and Panchganga Ghat. At two of the ghats (Manikarnika and Harishchandra Ghats), Hindus cremate their dead. The rivers 'Varuna' and 'Asi' combined form the name of the city \\"Varanasi\\". These two rivers flowing on the left bank of the Ganges enclose the old city of Varanasi. The ghats at the confluence sites of these two streams with the Ganges are also held in veneration. All these factors have contributed to the city being called the religious capital of Hinduism.Bansal p.48-49 Varanasi is also known as the favourite city of the Hindu deity Shiva as it has been mentioned in the Rigveda that this city in older times was known as Kashi or \\"Shiv ki Nagri\\". The Pandavas went to Kashi in search of Shiva to atone for their sins of fratricide and bramhanahatya that they had committed during the epic Kurukshetra war of Mahabharata epic. Among the innumerable temples in the city, most worshipped are: the Kashi Vishvanath Temple of Shiva; the Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple; and the Durga Temple known for the band of monkeys that reside in the large trees nearby. In addition, there are two new temples, the Tulasi Manas and the Vishvanatha temple located in the Banaras Hindu University campus. Ancient Buddhist monasteries are seen at Sarnath, but they are mostly in ruins. There are also temples built by the Maha Bodhi Society and by the Chinese, Burmese, and Tibetan Buddhists. Religious festivals are held here. On the occasion of the Mahashivaratri (meaning great night of Shiva) a procession of Shiva is taken from the Mahamrityunjaya Temple to the Kashi Vishvanath Temple. Another popular festival is the Ganges festival held in November or December when the Ganges is venerated by arti offered by thousands of pilgrims who also release lighted lamps to float in the river from the ghats (pictured). The historic event of Rama returning after 14 years of exile, termed vanavas (living in forest) in Sanskrit, and meeting his younger brother Bharat is celebrated during October or November as Bharat Milap ('Milap' means \\"meeting\\") festival. At the Tulsi Ghat, a classical musical soiree, particularly of dhrupad style, is held during March for 5 days where iconic artists from all parts of India are invited to perform. In one sentence, Mark Twain, the renowned Indophile, has extolled the greatness of Varanasi thus: \\"Benares is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend, and looks twice as old as all of them put together.\\" Varanasi is from Delhi, the national capital and from Lucknow, the state capital of Uttar Pradesh. Kanchipuram Kanchipuram (), the pilgrimage city, in Tamil Nadu, also known as Canjeevaram during the British rule, built during the Pallava Dynasty between 6th and 8th centuries, located on the bank of the Palar River, has an architectural legacy of over 1000 years. Before this period, it was the capital of early Cholas in the 2nd century BC. After the rule of the Pallava Dynasty, the Vijayanagara empire and the Nayaka dynasty period followed, in that order. Prior to the Pallava reign, it is conjectured, based on the chronicles of the Xuanzang, the Chinese pilgrim who visited Pallavas court, that the city was under the influence of Ashoka, the Mauryan emperor in 3rd century BC. Xuanzang had also noted that Buddha had visited this place. Jain and Buddhist temples and stupas of the Chola Dynasty reign have been recorded but mostly do not exist on ground. But South Indian architecture got a fillip only during the Pallava rule, particularly of rock cut temples during Mahendarvarman I's reign after he converted from Jainism to Hinduism . He was considered a man with vision and intelligence, a scholar, musician and a playwright. Kanchipuram was considered second only to Varanasi city in fame and learning. Adi Shankara, the Hindu philosopher saint, who propagated the Advaita philosophy lived and taught here in the eighth century AD.Ring p.435-436 The city has 108 Shaiva and 18 Vaishnava temples. The Hindu philosopher Ramanujacharya who propagated the Vishishtadvaita philosophy studied here. The temples are distributed in three zones of the city namely, the Vishnu temples are in the east zone, the Shiva shrines are on the outskirts of the city in the northern zone and the Jain mandirs are on the east across the Palar River. Some of the exquisitely designed and built temples of the Vijayanagar period in Vijayanagara architecture style are the Ekamabaranath temple tower which is in height, and the Varadaraja Swamy temple, which has a 1000-pillar hall. Kamakshi Amman temple is an ancient temple here and the most famous of all the temples in the city. It is associated with Adi Shankara. Legend has it that Kamakshi offered worship to a Shivaling made out of sand and gained Shiva's hand in marriage. The temple covers an area of about and the sanctum is covered with gold plated Vimana. Kamakshi is enshrined in the temple in a sitting posture called the Parabramha Swaroopini, seated with the trinity of Bramha, Vishnu and Shiva.Bansal p.149 It is located from Chennai, the state capital of Tamil Nadu and from Bangalore, the state capital of Karnataka. It has a good net work of roads, rail links and transport services to all parts of the country, and the nearest domestic and international airports are at Chennai. Ujjain Mahakal temple at Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh Ujjain () with an ancient scriptural name of Avantika compliments both rich historical and religious traditions. The history dates its links to the period of Vikramaditya and Ashoka (3rd century BC). The religious tradition links it to god Shiva triumphing over the demon king Tripurasura and then renaming the city as Ujjainyini (meaning 'conquers with pride'). Ujjain, probably, also marks the spread of Hindu religious beliefs to the Central Asia region. Particular mention could be made to the reign of Vima Kadphises, during the Kushan Dynasty, who considered Shiva as his divine patron. During his reign, apart from the influence of Greek religious practices, worship of Shiva, in particular, was also seen as an accepted practice in Iran. This leaning is attributed to Vima Kadphises's victory over Indian territory. Inscriptions of his times in Iran establish that he had converted the temple of Dioscuri (built during Greeko ‚Äì Bactrian period) at Dilberjin into a sanctuary for Shiva by decorating the place with a painting of Shiva and his wife Parvati. He got the wall painting of Shiva (Oeso) done by craftsmen he had taken from Ujjayani (Ujjain), apart from constructing a water conveyance system to the sanctuary of Shiva. Inscriptions further testify that the Kushan king attributed his rise to power to Srava (=Shiva) and Candavira. It is deduced that Candavira may be the same god as Candishvara, the God of Mahakala temple at Ujjain. It is also conjectured that the support of the Indian community (who worshipped Shiva) settled in eastern Iran and the encouragement he got from their priesthood, before and during his Indian campaign, and his relations with Ujjain, contributed to his deep involvement with the cult of Shiva. This devotion was continued by him even after his Indian campaign.Ring p.835-837 Emperor Ashoka also played a significant role as the Viceroy of Ujjain in enhancing its importance. Ashoka who ruled for three decades between 268 and 233 BC started his career in Taxila (now in Pakistan) in the north west by subduing a revolt. Thereafter, his father Bindusara, of the Mauryan Dynasty, transferred Ashoka as his Viceroy to Ujjain, which was the famous capital of the earlier kingdom of Avanti, in Central India. It was once the largest city and capital of Malwa region. In the ancient city of Ujjain, Jai Singh II ruled in the 18th century. Jai Singh II built an observatory here, called the Jantar Mantar. The reason for building the observatory here was that it was the centre of Hindu Astronomy since ancient times and it was located on the prime or first meridian (of longitude) established on the canons of Hindu astronomy. According to Indian astronomy, the first meridian of longitude passes through Ujjain. The modern calculations have established that the Tropic of Cancer passes through Ujjain.Bansal p.50-51 Ujjain is about south from Delhi, the capital city of India, and west of Bhopal, the state capital of Madhya Pradesh. It is away from Ahmedabad, and north-west of Mumbai. Dwarka A Painting depicting Krishna's Dwarka made during Akbar's reign from the Smithsonian Institution Krishna, an incarnation of god Vishnu, is believed to have migrated from Mathura to Dwarka () 5000 years ago and made Dwarka his capital., as noted in the scripture Bhagavata Purana.Bansal p.10 & 20 He established the city on the bank of the Gomti River. But after the death of Krishna, there was downfall of his dynasty, the Yadavas. This was further compounded by floods and eventual submergence of Krishna's city in the Arabian Sea. Presently, Dwarka is a small city located at the western tip of Saurashtra peninsular in Gujarat state on the shores of the Arabian Sea. Chronology of the recorded historic events witnessed at the temple city linked directly to the temple, is dated from 400 B.C. when Vajranabha built an umbrella type temple and deified his grand father Krishna's image there. It has undergone several changes with times under different rulers and in 800 AD, Adi Shankaracharya is said to have got the Dwarakadheesh temple renovated and also added a shrine of goddess Adya Shakti. Over the next few centuries more renovations took place with grant of additional land till 1261 AD, when the temple was destroyed by Mohamed Shah. In subsequent years also, renovation took place but there was dispute between two groups for the control of the temple. In 1504, Vallabhacharya established the image of Dwarakadeesh in a well in Ladva village to protect it from Muslim marauders and again it was shifted to Dungarpur where the temple was renovated. In 1861, Maharaja Khanderao renovated the temple. During British rule, the temple tower was rebuilt. A golden pitcher was fixed on the temple tower by Maharaja Gaekwad in the year 1903 and further renovations were undertaken by the then Shankarachrya of Dwarka Peet. Since 1960, the conservation of the temple is under the control of the Government of India. The present Dwarakhadheesh temple, also called the Jagat Mandir (universal shrine) or trilok sundar (most beautiful in all three worlds), is a seven storied structure, in height, appears to be raising above the Arabian sea. It is dated to the 13th century AD on the basis of oceanographic explorations undertaken to trace the ancient temple, which was submerged in the Arabian sea. The elegantly carved temple shikara (tower) is adorned with a huge flag, which is said to be in length with seven colours that can be seen flying from a distance of (hoisting this flag has a great religious significance). There is an approach to the back side of the temple from the Gomti River end, which is built of 56 steps. The temple built in soft limestone has a sanctum enclosed within a large hall with covered entrance from three sides. While the external carvings depict erotic scenes, the temple sanctum is austere in design but the main image is elaborately ornamented. A temple dedicated to Rukmini, Krishna's consort, is located in Bet Dwarka, away from Dwarka. The temple is said to be 2500 years old but in its present form it is inferred to be of 12th century vintage. It is a richly carved temple decorated with sculptures of gods and goddesses on the exterior with the sanctum housing the main image of Rukmini. Carved naratharas (human figures) and carved gajatharas (elephants) are depicted in panels at the base of the tower. An interesting legend is narrated to justify separate dwelling temples, far away from each other, for Rukmini and her husband Krishna. It is said that at the request of sage Durvasa (who was renowned for his short temper and bestowing curses) Krishna and Rukmini pulled a chariot taking sage Durvasa to their house for dinner. On the way, when Rukmini asked for water to quench her thirst, Krishna drew Ganges water, by prodding the ground with his toe, for her to drink. Rukmini quenched her thirst with the Ganges water. But Durvasa felt insulted since Rukmini did not have the courtesy to offer him water to drink. He, therefore, cursed her that she would live separately from her husband. Another legend states, while Dwarka was the official capital of Krishna where he held his assembly, his residence was at Bet Dwarka.

It was formerly the courthouse of the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri. Building history U.S. Courthouse and Post Office Acting as a point of departure during the great migration to the West, Kansas City experienced phenomenal urban growth and development during the early years of the twentieth century. By 1930, the city's increasing population warranted a new federal building to replace an existing post office and custom house. The 1930s New Deal programs, created to generate employment during the widespread economic downturn of the Great Depression, provided funding for construction of new federal buildings nationwide. Responding to Kansas City's need for a larger, more efficient building, the program funded a new U.S. Post Office and Courthouse in 1935. The building's construction, from 1938 to 1939, symbolized the ideals of the progressive public works projects. As one of the New Deal's last major construction projects of the 1930s, the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse provided modern space to accommodate the burgeoning presence of the federal government in Kansas City. The building's architectural design was produced by the prominent local architecture firm Wight and Wight, whose distinguished civic work includes the Jackson County Courthouse (1934), City Hall (1937), and the Municipal Courts Building (1938). These projects, including the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse, represent Wight and Wight's shift from the Classical Revival, which previously dominated federal architecture, toward the Moderne movement that was beginning to emerge nationwide during the 1930s. The Courthouse's abstracted classicism with Art Deco references embodies this stylistic transition. In 1952, the building received national attention when Thurgood Marshall represented the plaintiff of the Swope Park Swimming Pool desegregation case. As the first major desegregation case in Kansas City, the deliberations stirred the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement. Plans have been made to renovate the entire building to accommodate new, nonfederal tenants as part of an upcoming outlease program. The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Architecture The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse artfully embodies the Art Modern style that was becoming increasingly influential by the late 1930s - a time when many federal architects experimented with abstracted classical motifs combined with a reduction in architectural ornament. The building's flat planes of Indiana limestone are nearly devoid of classical ornamentation, which is limited to the punctuated regular rhythm of elongated bays. Encompassing a full city block along Grand Avenue, each of the four sides of the immense ten- story edifice is similar in design, divided into three horizontal sections. The facade's (west elevation's) three-story base rises with smooth walls pierced by elongated bays enclosing the first- and second-story windows, which are divided by decorative spandrels. Each bay is pierced by paired punched windows separated by limestone mullions at the third story. A series of wide granite steps with bronze handrails leads from Grand Avenue to the three central bays enclosing the entrances. The striking dark texture of the cast- bronze door framing and grill work above exhibit restrained classical detailing, and contrast with the light tones and smoothness of the pale-gray Indiana limestone walls. The upper stories are set back from the base at each elevation, rising five stories in similarly planar limestone walls. The fifth story echoes the fourth-story fenestration and creates the building's middle section by an elegant string course of Greek fretwork. The bays above are elongated to enclose eleven bays of four-story stacked fenestration, with each window divided by decorative aluminum spandrels repeated from the base. Above the ninth story is a wide entablature, composed of a blank architrave and frieze, and a simple cornice. The interiors retain their original design and continue the spare ornamentation with emphasis on fine materials and abstracted geometric motifs. The vestibule is clad in marble upon a black granite base and features original bronze sidelights flanking each doorway and adjacent recessed wood-paneled telephone niches. The T-shaped central lobby is finished with multicolor terrazzo floors, golden-veined Genevieve marble for the walls, and high plaster ceilings. The cream-colored terrazzo is bordered with black and green terrazzo cross bands to reflect the geometric patterns of the ceiling beams. Marble pilasters detailed with Greek fretwork divide the walls into three bays, while four freestanding, rectangular marble-clad columns dominate the central space. The former postal lobby has similarly refined materials of marble pilasters and terrazzo flooring, with marble wainscoting at the service windows. At the east side of the central lobby, molded marble surrounds with black granite plinth blocks enclose a bank of six elevators. The north and south lobby walls contain marble-framed double doors with panelized details; these doors lead to the main stairwells, where flights of pink marble stairs and brass railings ascend to the north and south lobbies. Four historic courtrooms, located on the fourth and sixth floors, exude modernity with elegant finishes, making them the most historically significant spaces within the building. The courtrooms are nearly identical, rising two stories and featuring leather-covered doors, light and dark cork- tile flooring, pink-granite baseboards, and wood-paneled wainscoting. Pilasters divide the space into regular bays, rising to support wood trim and plaster crown moldings. The recessed ceiling panels contain two original brass pendant lights and a large circular aluminum air grille, and are divided by wide beams adorned with gold-leaf paint finishes. The courtrooms are windowless, relying on advanced lighting and an air-conditioning system, considered to be state-of-the-art when the building was completed.

The Richard Bolling Federal Building is a United States federal building located at 601 East 12th Street in Kansas City, Missouri. Completed in 1965, the building is bordered by East Twelfth, East Thirteenth, Locust, and Holmes streets in the Central Business District in Kansas City. The building was named for Congressman Richard Walker Bolling in 1994. Building history In the years following World War II, the federal government grew rapidly and the changing needs of the federal workforce required office buildings designed to meet new challenges. Mechanized mass- production techniques for building components and increased familiarity with innovative construction materials and technologies provided architects with new ways to create functional and cost-efficient buildings. Structural steel, glass, and concrete became widely used building materials. At the same time, the American public was receptive to new, unprecedented architectural forms and ideals. Throughout the United States, federal architecture was less ceremonial, monumental, and ornate than public buildings from previous eras, and for the first time government buildings began to resemble private architecture.Richard Bolling Federal Building page from the General Services Administration. The design of the new Kansas City federal building was the product of a joint-venture collaboration of four firms: Voskamp and Slezak, Everitt and Keleti, Radotinsky Meyn Deardorff, and Howard, Needles, Tammen & Bergendoff. Voskamp and Slezak of Kansas City was the lead firm in the project. Construction began in 1962, and was completed in 1965. The site occupies two full blocks and contains a tall office tower, a low building, and a landscaped plaza. Many architects used this combination of built components for federal building design during the 1950s and 1960s, possibly in emulation of the Headquarters of the United Nations. In 1994, the building was rededicated in honor of Congressman Richard Bolling (1916-1991), who represented Missouri's 5th congressional district from 1949 to 1983. Bolling was a member of the Committee on Rules and greatly influenced congressional reform in the 1970s. As of 2015, 16 federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and Health and Human Services, occupy the building. The building has also served as a courthouse for the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri. Architecture Side view of the Richard Bolling Federal Building. The building contains 1.2 million gross square feet, the most out of any other building in the midwest, pairing a tall office tower with a long, low building arranged around a central plaza. The dominant feature of the site is the 18-story office tower with a flat roof. Using Modern-era materials, the building has a fire-proof steel frame. The two primary elevations are faced with glass panes and aluminum panels that alternate in a checkerboard pattern. The glass is tinted grey and the aluminum panels are slightly concave with a large X pattern located within each plate. The two narrow end walls are devoid of fenestration. These angular elevations are faced with variegated granite. The long, low building is set slightly off-center of the tower. Long vertical strips of aluminum tube cladding are original to the building, but sections of it were removed and reinstalled in a wave pattern during 2000 renovations. A large bronze United States seal with an eagle motif signifies the building's federal use. The interior features public spaces finished in high-quality materials. Marble piers are present in the main lobby, while marble paneled walls are in the elevator lobby. Dark granite tiles cover the floors of both areas. Public art is an integral element of both the interior and exterior of the building. A large mural titled The Movement of Time from Redman to Truman (1967) by Frederick Conway is located in the lobby. A bas-relief stone sculpture called The Builders (1966) by Costantino Nivola forms the exterior base of the Twelfth Street elevation. The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) initiated several projects to improve the building. BNIM Architects developed designs for the facility that included a new entry pavilion, corridor renovations, and plaza improvements. Completed in 2003, the renovations to the building and plaza were part of GSA's First Impressions initiative, which strives to improve the entrance experience for both tenants and visitors. The architects designed a new entrance lobby on the Twelfth Street elevation. A covered walkway leads to a new two-story, glass-enclosed entrance pavilion and lobby that is connected to the lower building, but also provides access to the office tower. The glass pavilion has a flat roof that is supported by four white columns. This new entrance serves to visually connect the large tower to the Civic Center at Twelfth and Locust streets. Renovations to the plaza integrated security features into the design with the installation of new flagpoles, benches, and planters. A black granite reflecting pool visually extends the black terrazzo floor of the lobby. In 2004, BNIM Architects, along with J.E. Dunn Construction, received an Honor Award from the Kansas City chapter of the American Institute of Architects for these renovations and alterations. The jury praised the architects' design, which reestablishes the connection between the federal building and its larger urban setting. BNIM Architects also received a 2004 GSA Design Award for its innovative entrance and landscape plans that incorporate state-of-the-art security while maintaining a welcoming atmosphere. A separate project by Helix Architecture Design was later initiated to provide a complete modernization and renovation of the building, including new lighting systems and total replacement of heating, cooling, plumbing, and electrical systems. This project was set to span ten years, at an estimated cost of $250 million.

Completed in 1904, the building was expanded from 1932 to 1933. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as U. S. Post Office. It has also been known as Federal Building and U.S. Court House. It is a contributing building in the NRHP-listed Butte Historic District. With . The building was renamed in 2002 to honor Michael Joseph Mansfield (1903‚Äì2001), a U.S. representative and senator. Building history The building has a colorful history that spans more than 100 years. By the beginning of the twentieth century, the frontier town of Butte was a vibrant copper-mining center, attracting numerous immigrant groups and becoming a \\"melting pot\\" of the frontier. Butte became the site of the government's fourth largest immigration office and consequently needed a federal building. The building, which was constructed to serve as a combined courthouse and post office, was designed by Supervising Architect of the United States Treasury Department James Knox Taylor, who was noted for designing many post office buildings between 1897 and 1912. The cornerstone of the building was laid in May 1903. The building was constructed for a cost of $300,000, and was dedicated on December 8, 1904. At that time, it was within a block of several mines and dozens of wood frame lodging and commercial buildings. After the building opened, the elaborate courtroom was the site of numerous naturalization ceremonies as thousands of immigrants became citizens. One of the most dramatic incidents in Butte history occurred in the courtroom on May 21, 1924, during Prohibition, which outlawed the sale, manufacture, or transportation of liquor. John O'Leary, a convicted bootlegger, began shooting a gun wildly about the crowded courtroom before turning it on himself. O'Leary survived, and no one else was injured. One bullet hit the bench, narrowly missing the judge, and a bullet hole in the upper portion of the side rear courtroom door remains. The Mike Mansfield Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse is located within the Butte National Historic Landmark district, which was designated in 1961. When the National Historic Preservation Act was passed in 1966, the district was also listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In 1979, the building was listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places. The building was renamed to honor Mike Mansfield,H.R. 3282, Congressional Record, Volume 147 (2001), Part 18, p. 24897-24898 one of Montana's most notable and beloved statesmen, in 2002. Architecture The Mike Mansfield Federal Building and United States Courthouse in 1933. The building is located within an area that was once the core of Butte's bustling business district and is also close to local mining activity. Early drawings indicate the presence of tunnels and mine shafts on the building site. Architect James Knox Taylor expertly adapted the building design to the sloping terrain. Constructed between 1903 and 1904, the building is an excellent example of the Renaissance Revival style of architecture, which was popular during the Victorian era. One hallmark of the style that is present on the building is the rusticated first story, which consists of smooth blocks of terra cotta with deep, horizontal grooves between the blocks. Other typical features include the roof balustrade and the use of corner blocks called quoins. The architect chose the Renaissance Revival style to display the government's taste and refinement; the massing and materials lend a sense of permanence to the structure and assert the federal government's presence in Butte. The building was constructed of fireproof materials in accordance with a local ordinance that was passed after a fire in 1879 destroyed numerous wood-frame buildings in the town. The facade of the Mike Mansfield Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse is arranged symmetrically and has a projecting central pavilion. The facade features exceptionally high- quality materials. The entrance steps and the basement elevations are composed of coursed, cut granite. The first story is faced with pale terra cotta and is topped by a belt course that encircles the building. Bricks on the second and third stories are laid in a pattern called Flemish bond that consists of alternating headers and stretchers. Many of the decorative components of the building are executed in terra cotta and include the quoins, the elaborate entablature that tops the building, the roof balustrade, and the central cartouche (scrolled, oval ornament). An eagle ornament above the main entrance expresses the federal presence in Butte. The interior of the building also features high-quality materials. The most impressive space is the courtroom, which dominates the second and third stories. The courtroom doors are solid oak, as is the hand-carved judge's bench. Tall windows are topped with round arches and flanked with marble pilasters (attached columns). The vaulted ceiling displays decorative plaster, adding to the stateliness of the space. The Copper Street lobby, which features marble wainscot, is another important interior space that retains original finishes. An ornate stairway that extends from the basement to the third story is a focal point of the interior. The stairway's treads are rose-colored marble. Terrazzo flooring is found throughout the building, although some areas have been covered with other types of floor covering. Other portions of the interior contain polished white Vermont marble baseboards, wainscot, and pilasters. The building originally had a U-shaped footprint, but was enlarged in 1932 and 1933. The addition was designed by James A. Wetmore, Acting Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury Department at that time. Wetmore's addition respects both the design and materials of the original portion of the building. The addition more than doubled the usable square footage of the building. In 1965, the post office moved out of the building, and the Main Street lobby was altered substantially. Subsequent interior alterations occurred in 1992, when much of the first floor was modernized for new tenants.

Built between 1911 and 1913, an expansion initiated in 1927 and completed in 1929 allowed the building to serve thereafter as a courthouse of the United States District Court for the District of Montana. The building was again expanded in the 1930s, and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Building history Missoula began as a small village in the 1860s, but grew quickly when it became a hub of the Northern Pacific Railroad in the 1880s. By the start of the 20th century, it was an important regional trading center for western Montana, northern Idaho, and eastern Washington. Because of the growing population and the subsequent need for services, Missoula was selected as the location for a federal building. In 1907, the government purchased four lots along Cedar Street, which was later renamed Broadway Street, for $19,850. The Supervising Architect of the Treasury, James Knox Taylor, designed the new building, and construction commenced in January 1911. The building opened in 1913, and the original tenants were the U.S. Postal Service and the U.S. Forest Service. The Daily Missoulan called the building \\"a handsome structure, an ornament to the city.\\" As Missoula continued to grow, additional space for federal functions was needed. In 1927, James A. Wetmore, acting supervising architect of the U.S. Treasury Department, designed an extension and an annex to the original building to house judicial functions. Construction was completed in 1929, and the building hosted its first session of U.S. District Court on December 5, 1929. Despite the increase in space, the building required another enlargement in the 1930s. Designed by Louis A. Simon of the U.S. Treasury Department, the second annex was dedicated on October 13, 1937. The building, which has served as the headquarters for the Northern Region of the U.S. Forest Service since 1914, was the location of the investigation into the tragic 1949 fire at Mann Gulch in the Helena National Forest. Thirteen firefighters, who were members of an elite U.S. Forest Service team known as the smokejumpers, died when the blaze blocked their escape route. The 1952 film Red Skies of Montana was based on the Mann Gulch fire, and one of the scenes features the Federal Building, U.S. Post Office and Courthouse. The majority of postal functions moved out of the building in 1974, but a small post office remains. Numerous federal agencies occupy the building today. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The district court now meets in the Russell Smith Courthouse, across the street. Architecture The Federal Building, U.S. Post Office and Courthouse is located on a block bounded by Broadway, Pine, and Pattee streets, near the central business area. The original architect, James Knox Taylor, designed the building in the Italian Renaissance Revival style of architecture, which was commonly used for federal building design throughout the country. Its classically inspired design conveyed the dignity of the federal government. The building is three stories in height and utilizes a steel-frame and reinforced-concrete structural system. Despite the additions of the annexes, the building presents a cohesive appearance because both additions were designed to be compatible with the original building. The foundation is clad in smooth-faced granite, and limestone ashlar covers the principal facade and side elevations. The rear elevation is clad in economical buff-colored brick. The building displays many character-defining features of the Italian Renaissance Revival style of architecture. Deep ribs in the limestone define the first story. The symmetrical facade features arched entrances. Prominent limestone window surrounds on the second and third stories are another common feature. The upper stories are defined by a series of two-story pilasters (attached columns) that have Corinthian capi-tals with ornate acanthus leaf patterns. A carved ornamental eagle on the 1929 annex conveys the federal significance of the building. The original building is separated from the 1929 expansion by a narrow connector topped with a glass- enclosed atrium, which the U.S. Forest Service originally used as a greenhouse. A single-story addition housing conference rooms was added in 1952 and is the last enlargement. The post office lobby, which is part of the original building, retains many historic features and finishes. The floors are covered in gray terrazzo set within a gray marble border. The marble extends up the wall to form wainscot. Above the wainscot, the walls are covered with plaster and feature pilasters similar to those on the exterior. A dentil (rectangular block) course encircles the lobby. The ceiling is covered with painted plaster panels divided by beams. Original bronze pendant light fixtures and sconces illuminate the space. Original oak doors remain. The 1937 annex lobby also retains many original features. The floor is covered with panels of alternating light and dark marble that are arranged on a 45-degree angle with the lobby walls. The walls are covered with deep beige marble, and each contains a centrally placed arched opening. The walls are trimmed in dark gray marble at the base, while a molded wood cornice with a dentil course tops the space. The plaster ceiling features a decorative circular medallion from which a bronze pendant light descends. The arched opening on the west leads to an exit that is framed with darkly stained wood and contains a fanlight. Decorative bronze medallions flank the exit. To the east, the arched opening leads to an elevator that has original bronze doors and surrounds. Although the courtroom is no longer used for judicial purposes, some original features remain since conversion into office space. Original wood and leather doors are in place. Paneled wood wainscot covers the walls and a painted wood cornice tops the room. Three two-story arched windows are symmetrically placed on the north wall of the courtroom. The molded wood surrounds and mullions are original.

It is no longer used as a courthouse for the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska. Building history In 1859, just two years after they founded Grand Island, Nebraska, German settlers established the community's first post office. For many years, however, the post office shared space with various commercial establishments. When Congressman George W. Norris secured funding for a new post office building during the early years of the 20th century, Grand Island was one of the last major cities in Nebraska to lack this important type of public building. Supervising Architect of the Treasury James Knox Taylor designed the new post office and federal building in Grand Island, authorizing the final architectural plans in 1908. Workers completed the building, which officially opened on November 26, 1910, at a cost of $108,000. By this time, Grand Island was the third largest city in Nebraska and its economy was thriving. Postal facilities occupied the first floor of the new building, while the second floor held a two-story district courtroom and associated court offices. As its population increased, Grand Island required expanded postal services and additional federal office space. In 1933, local architect Charles W. Steinbaugh designed an addition to the building, which opened in 1935. Two years later, the post office began housing the headquarters for Grand Island's Works Progress Administration (WPA) district office, a function that it served until 1939. In 1968, the U.S. Postal Service vacated the building after securing a new facility. The same year, the U.S. General Services Administration purchased the building and renovated the first floor into office space for federal agencies. Current tenants include the FBI, Bureau of Reclamation, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Federal Building is located in downtown Grand Island, in close proximity to the county courthouse and various retail establishments and residential buildings. The Grand Island Federal Building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2006 to recognize its architectural significance and contribution to community development. Architecture The Grand Island Federal Building is a visually restrained but striking local landmark, occupying the southwest corner of the intersection of West Second and North Locust streets. Supervising Architect of the Treasury James Knox Taylor preferred classically inspired styles, deeming them appropriately dignified for public architecture. The Federal Building is an example of the Neoclassical architectural style, exhibiting design components derived from Greek, Roman, and Renaissance traditions. Taylor also supported the use of high-quality building materials, ensuring that the buildings constructed under his tenure would have lasting presences in their towns and cities. The two- story Federal Building faces north onto Second Street. It is constructed of buff-colored brick, some of which is laid in decorative herringbone patterns, with limestone trim. The original portion of the building, which is constructed on a limestone foundation, is symmetrical, with the 1935 addition extending to the west. The central block projects slightly, articulating the entrance, which is reached by a small flight of stairs. A large wood door with carved medallions and inset metal grilles is centered in the central block. The first story features three round-arch openings that contain cast-iron frames and transoms with decorative circular, oval, and floral patterns. The arched openings are topped with scrolled limestone keystones flanked by circular medallions. Vertically aligned with the arches on the second story of the facade, three central windows feature small balconets with cast-iron balustrades. The bays are divided by two-story pilasters with stylized capitals. The pilasters support a classical entablature that features an architrave, frieze, and cornice with a dentil course. On the original portion of the building, other openings are rectangular and topped by flat arches with limestone keystones. A roofline brick parapet wall with limestone coping and pedestals is on the original portion of the building. A secondary entrance, located on the east elevation, features a limestone surround with a decorative lintel carved with a foliated motif. An original cast-iron light fixture with replacement globe extends from the lintel. The rear elevation contains an original U-shaped light court. The chimney, clad in brick and topped with a limestone cap, extends from the southeastern corner of the low-pitched hipped roof, which is covered with standing-seam metal. The 1935 addition is constructed of buff-colored brick, but lacks the original structure's decorative classical details. The postal lobby once spanned the length of the facade on the first floor. Although the postal lobby features have been removed, original materials remain. These finishes include the terrazzo and marble floor, and marble and plaster walls. Round-arch openings with wood frames and a vaulted ceiling with original pendant chandeliers dominate the space. An original staircase with dark green marble risers and pink marble treads at the east end of the lobby provides access to the second floor. An ornate cast-iron lamp post atop a marble pedestal and surmounted by a spherical globe is located adjacent to the staircase. On the second floor, the two-story courtroom has been subdivided, but the corridors retain original materials, including terrazzo and marble flooring, plaster walls, and wood doors and frames. Over the course of the building's history, it has under-gone periodic upgrades and renovations, not always in keeping with the structure's historic character. In 1979 and 1980, original wood-sash windows were replaced with aluminum windows; however, the windows' original dimensions remain intact. Recently, GSA corrected some prior work that altered historic features. Most notably, the agency removed an inappropriate aluminum door from the Locust Street elevation and installed a replica of the original door.

Campos United States Courthouse is a historic courthouse building located at Santa Fe in Santa Fe County, New Mexico. Formerly designated simply as the United States Courthouse, it was renamed for the late District Judge Santiago E. Campos in 2004.To designate the United States courthouse at South Federal Place in Santa Fe, New Mexico, as the \`Santiago E. Campos United States Courthouse,' S 2385 RFH, 108th Congress, 2d Session, in the House of Representatives, July 20, 2004. Building history The building had its beginnings as the proposed territorial capitol for New Mexico. In 1848 under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Mexico ceded what is now New Mexico, Arizona, California, Texas, and portions of Colorado, Utah and Nevada, to the United States. The New Mexico territorial government was established two years later. In 1851 Congress appropriated $20,000 and in 1854 an additional $50,000 to construct a \\"state house\\" on what is now Federal Plaza. Plans for the building were prepared by the Supervising Architect of the Treasury, Ammi B. Young, perhaps based on sketches by Chief Justice Joab Houghton, a member of the U.S. Territorial Supreme Court for New Mexico. Construction began in 1853, with the walls rising one-and-one-half stories above the basement by the following year. Construction continued intermittently due to limited funding, lack of competent workmen, and difficulties imposed by the Civil War. As the years wore on, the half-built structure was essentially abandoned. In 1883 the building grounds were chosen as the site for Santa Fe's \\"Tertio-Millennial\\" celebration, and the building shell received a temporary roof. The grounds were cleared and an oval racetrack, about 1/3 mile long, was set up surrounding the site. Indian participants were housed in the first floor during the celebration. The \\"state house\\" was finally finished in 1889, although it was never used for this purpose. Instead, at its completion, it was occupied by a land claims court and has housed various federal courts since that time. The territorial capitol building was constructed on another site in Santa Fe between 1895 and 1900. New Mexico became a state in 1912. As the needs of the courts exceeded the building's capacity, an addition was planned that echoed the original Greek Revival style. This addition was built in 1929-1930 under the direction of Louis A. Simon, Superintendent of the Architectural Section of the Treasury Department. It more than doubled the overall size of the courthouse. The U.S. Courthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Architecture The courthouse is located adjacent to the Santa Fe Post Office in Federal Plaza. The plaza is enclosed by a stone wall with metal pipe railings that follows the outline of the 1883 racetrack. The Greek Revival courthouse building, originally intended to be the capitol, was constructed in two stages; the first in 1853-1854 and the second in 1888-1889. The Greek Revival style of the original design with prominent pediment and porticos is characteristic of the work of Ammi B. Young, Supervising Architect of the Treasury Department. However, other elements of the design including the roof and second-story window treatments have a character more reminiscent of the Renaissance Revival architectural style of the late 1880s. To the north of the original building is a 1929-30 addition. Both buildings are rectangular, and are oriented parallel to each other, with the addition being slightly smaller than the original building. A two-story vestibule, built at the same time as the addition, connects the buildings at their midpoints. A semicircular projecting bay on the vestibule's east elevation encloses an elegant, interlocking cantilevered stairway. The courthouse walls are of rough stone quarried in the Hyde Park area of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, while details such as quoins and lintels are of dressed stone from the hills of Cerrillos, a small town about eighteen miles southwest of Santa Fe. Both buildings are two stories tall and have the same symmetrical layout. The north and south elevations of both structures are articulated by nine bays, while the shorter east and west elevations are three bays wide. The south elevation of the original building recalls the Greek Revival style, as interpreted in the 1880s. The classical entrance with fluted Doric order pilasters and elaborate entablature replaced the original in 1929-1930. The arched windows above have ornamental stone trim. A broad pediment surmounts the center section of the elevation. Porticos with Ionic columns mark the east and west entrances, though only the one over the west entrance is original. (The east portico was constructed with the 1929-1930 addition). The windows of the first floor are of simple rectangular design; in the unfinished 1853-1854 structure, these window openings had segmental arches. The second-story windows are arched with elegant cut-stone moldings in the original building and rubble stone detailing in the addition. A copper- clad bracketed cornice supports the low-pitched, hipped copper roof. In an 1884 ceremony attended by about 5,000 people, a sandstone obelisk erected by the Grand Army of the Republic was unveiled at the main entrance of the building. The monument honored Christopher \\"Kit\\" Carson (1809‚Äì1868), a veteran of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the American Civil War. Six murals of landscapes are placed on the walls near the north and south entrances of the original building. Commissioned as a WPA project, they were completed in 1938 by noted Santa Fe painter and designer William Penhallow Henderson, who is credited as a co-founder of the Santa Fe Art Colony and with popularizing the Pueblo Revival style of architecture. A major restoration project undertaken by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) was completed in 2002. The roof and limestone decorative elements were cleaned and repaired. The large bronze doors at the main entrance, which had become blackened over the years, were thoroughly cleaned and polished, returning them to their former brilliance. Differential settlement of the sandstone exterior walls over many years had caused roof framing above Judge Campos' courtroom and offices to pull loose where attached to supporting walls. New steel framing within the attic space, hidden from view, was installed during this restoration to prevent eventual collapse of the roof that otherwise would eventually occur had the timber framing continued to pull apart. Repairs were made to the Kit Carson memorial to correct cracking in the sandstone. GSA was recognized for its stewardship of the U.S. Courthouse with a State of New Mexico Heritage Preservation Award in May, 2000. The completed project was recognized with a 2002 \\"Muchas Gracias\\" historic preservation award from the City of Santa Fe.

Holloway Jr. United States Courthouse (formerly the Federal Building and United States Courthouse) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma is a courthouse of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma and the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.General Services Administration, Federal Building & U.S. Courthouse, Oklahoma City, OK. Building history By the mid-1950s, the federal government had outgrown its courtroom and office space in Oklahoma City in the 1912 U.S. Post Office and Courthouse. Judge Alfred P. Murrah spearheaded the effort to secure funding for a new federal building and courthouse to be constructed directly north of the existing building. The government selected Oklahoma architect Dow Gumerson to design the new building. At that time, architects were designing federal buildings in Modern styles using innovative forms and materials. Following these trends while also retaining some traditions such as the use of high-quality materials and minimal Classical detailing, Gumerson eschewed the ornate architecture of the past and designed an unadorned yet dignified building. Gumerson's plans for the new five-story building were approved in 1959. Gumerson incorporated several innovative ideas for the interior spaces, which he designed for flexibility and function. When the federal judges indicated that they were resolving many cases through efficient pretrial conferences rather than long trials, Gumerson included special rooms resembling libraries that were less intimidating than courtrooms for informal meetings. These spaces remain in place, although some now serve additional functions such as law libraries for the judges. Construction was completed in 1961 at a cost of $7 million. Early occupants of the building included the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, United States Department of the Treasury, United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse is located within a federal complex that includes the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse and the Murrah Parking Garage and Plaza. The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was also part of this complex until the April 1995 truck bomb explosion that killed 168 people. Today, the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum occupies the site. The Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse withstood the blast, although some windows and lights shattered. In 2016, the building was renamed in honor of William Judson Holloway Jr. (1923‚Äì2014), a former chief judge of the Tenth Circuit. Architecture \\"Unity\\", one of two sculptures on the facade of the courthouse. The Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse is a Modern building with a box-like form and minimal adornment. Architect Dow Gumerson paid special attention to the scale and details of the nearby 1912 U.S. Post Office and Courthouse, sensitively designing a building that does not overshadow neighboring architecture. The building is an example of Formalism, a style of Modern architecture that emphasizes high-quality materials, smooth wall surfaces, and columnar supports. It also retains characteristics of the earlier distinguished Stripped Classical style that architects used for federal buildings during the Great Depression era. Gumerson avoided many of the typical, mundane federal designs of the 1960s, making the building unusual among government facilities of its time. Gumerson's design is also notable for its use of fine materials on both the interior and exterior. Clad in Indiana limestone and granite, the building is composed of a central block that rises slightly above flanking wings. The facade is dominated by a colonnade, a design feature Gumerson borrowed from the earlier U.S. Post Office and Courthouse to unify the collection of buildings within Oklahoma City's federal complex. The colonnade rises from the second story, above the street-level entrance, and has thin rectangular engaged columns with a recessed wall behind it. Windows throughout the building, including those on the recessed wall, are evenly spaced and small in scale. The exterior is largely devoid of architectural ornamentation. However, Gumerson allowed for a few decorative elements to articulate the entrances. The main entrance is recessed and flanked by diagonally positioned limestone panels that form a sawtooth, accordion-like pattern, creating texture and the illusion of movement. Entrances on the east and west elevations are framed with geometric patterns executed in aluminum. Two bas-relief sculptures of stylized grouped figures adorn the limestone walls above the side entrances. Noted sculptor Bernard Emerson Frazier, a former director of the Philbrook Art Center in Tulsa who studied American aboriginal art, created the figures. Although Frazier initially designed nudes, he ultimately executed clothed figures after a local protest. Unity, completed in 1966, is located on the east elevation and portrays a Native American man and woman with two European settlers drawn together by an allegorical depiction of unity. Destiny, completed the following year, is located on the west elevation and depicts a male and a female, with the woman's outstretched hand extending through a flame. An eagle is at their backs. The interior contains thirteen courtrooms and one hearing room. The district courtrooms and a ceremonial courtroom occupy the third floor and extend two stories. Designed for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, the original fifth-floor courtroom contains a unique circular lightwell, which is located directly over the judge's bench and surrounded by linear source lights. The courtrooms are paneled in walnut veneer that was hand-picked by Gumerson during a trip to a lumber mill in Savannah. The veneer is book matched, a process that requires cutting each panel to create mirror-images of the wood grain. These panels were installed to create symmetrical designs throughout the courtrooms. A similar process was used for the marble surfaces in the building. Black and white marble panels, which have a faint greenish cast, clad the walls of the elevator lobbies and public corridors on each floor. Polished terrazzo floors unify the interior spaces throughout the building. In the 2000s, the building has undergone several restoration projects. The exterior walls were cleaned, restoring the original warm shades of the granite and limestone. The walnut paneling in the courtrooms has been refinished to its original tone, correcting yellowing of the varnish that occurred since its installation. In the ceremonial courtroom, four of five original skylights have been uncovered to admit natural light as initially intended.

Built in 1907, the building still serves its original function, and was renovated and expanded in 1937, and again in 2004. In 1979, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as a contributing building to the Wheeling Historic District. Building history In 1849, the first suspension bridge spanning the Ohio River was constructed at Wheeling, providing a new route to the West along the National Road. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad mainline reached Wheeling in 1853, prompting a dramatic increase in population, commerce, and industry. As a result of its proximity to important transportation routes, Wheeling prospered. It served as the capital of West Virginia from 1863 to 1870 and 1875 to 1885. Consequently, Wheeling outgrew the 1859 U.S. Custom House (now West Virginia Independence Hall) designed by Ammi B. Young. In 1902, federal officials obtained a site for a proposed new structure. The public initially criticized the site selection because it was located away from the center of the city. However, following the 1907 completion of the building, which included a post office, courthouse, and custom house, development soon shifted to the north.General Services Administration page on the Federal Building and United States Courthouse (Wheeling, West Virginia). The Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse was constructed under the Tarsney Act of 1893, which allowed the United States Department of the Treasury to hold competitions for the design of select federal buildings with the intention of improving governmental architecture's quality. The Wheeling federal building, designed in the Beaux Arts Classicism style, set a high standard for architectural excellence. Marsh & Peter, a prominent firm with several Washington, D.C., commissions, designed the building. Wheeling architect Frank Faris served as the local project superintendent. The building has been expanded and altered several times. In 1937, as Wheeling required increased services, architect George W. Petticord designed an addition that complemented the original building's Beaux Arts character. Completed in 1938, this expansion accommodated a new post office and district courtroom. Petticord, a Wheeling native, also completed plans for a dramatic interior renovation that replaced many original finishes. In 1999, a small wing was added to the rear of the building to create more secure holding and circulation areas for detainees. Most recently, HLM Design with Goody, Clancy & Associates, designed a dramatic glass annex. Completed in 2004, it contains federal agency offices and court-related spaces. Architecture The courthouse is a stately example of Beaux Arts Classicism architecture, providing downtown Wheeling with an elegant building that conveys the federal government's former dignity. The granite building displays many character-defining features of the Beaux Arts Classicism style, including a symmetrical, monumental facade and paired columns. The first-story stonework is rusticated with incised horizontal bands, contrasting with the smooth blocks of the upper stories. The recessed main entrance is framed by a wide surround, which is in turn encircled by a carved garland. An ornate oval medallion with a garland, acanthus leaves, and a shell motif tops the doorway. Rectangular, first-story windows have flat arches with projecting keystones. A colonnade that features paired Ionic columns with stylized foliated motifs and unusual tassel ornamentation dominates the three central bays of the second and third stories. Small balustrades with urn-shaped members extend between the columns. Large tripartite, multi-pane, double-hung windows are located on the second story between the columns. Spandrels separate the large windows from smaller tripartite windows on the third story. A key motif and centrally placed projecting keystones top the windows. Also on the second story and flanking the colonnade are windows with elaborate semi-circular hoods featuring scrolled brackets supporting oval medallions. Decorative balustrades are located below each window. The columns support a classical entablature that consists of a molded architrave, an incised frieze with an egg-and-dart molding, and a cornice that features a dentil course. A balustrade tops the building. The interior of the original portion contains the postal lobby. Although modified during the 1930s, the lobby remains a significant interior space. The terrazzo flooring forms a checkerboard pattern. Marble pilasters, baseboards, and wainscot and aluminum doors, grilles, and postal service windows are present. The two-story district courtroom has a low-relief plaster ceiling with a simple border. Walnut is used for the wainscoting, judge's bench, jury box, public benches, and door surrounds. The 1938 addition, built to accommodate a district courtroom, altered the symmetry of the building. The addition uses materials and architectural details that are compatible with the original building. The first-story granite walls are also rusticated, but the second-story window hoods are less detailed than those of the original building. In 1999, a small addition on the rear of the building was constructed to accommodate holding cells and secure circulation. Construction of an annex to house new courtrooms began in 2002 and was completed in 2004 under GSA's Design Excellence Program. The entrance incorporates a striking glass-curtain wall with twenty-five images of the Great Seal of the United States screened on five-by-five foot glass panels. The remaining exterior walls are constructed of limestone and brick and rest on a granite base. A four-story atrium links the annex with historic portions of the building. The granite wall of the 1938 addition is preserved inside the sun-lit lobby. The limestone flooring is embedded with fossils. Integrated into this space is a sculpture called River of Light by Mikyoung Kim. The artwork features layers of glass implanted with fiber optic rods that slowly change color. The sculpture evokes both the movement of the Ohio River and Wheeling's industrial heritage as a glass-making center. Kim's work received a 2004 Design Excellence Citation for Art in Architecture from the U.S. General Services Administration. View from Suspension Bridge, a painting by West Virginia artist Susan Poffenbarger located adjacent to the second-floor elevators, depicts the Ohio River as seen from the suspension bridge. The new second- floor district courtroom overlooks the atrium lobby and contains dark cherry paneling and metal light fixtures. Other spaces include a bankruptcy courtroom, magistrate courtroom, jury assembly room, and offices. The project won Buildings magazine's new construction award in 2004.

Maximilian \\"Max\\" Cohen was an American socialist politician of the early 20th Century. Cohen held a series of important posts during the pivotal year of 1919, including Secretary of the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party for Local Greater New York, Secretary of the Left Wing National Council, and business manager for the New York Communist. Cohen was also a founding member of the Communist Party of America in that same year. Biography Early years Maximilian Cohen was born in the United States of ethnic Jewish parents. He grew up in New York City and became actively involved in radical politics as a very young man, joining the Socialist Labor Party in 1904 before moving to the Socialist Party of America in 1913. He trained and worked professionally as a dentist. The early US Communist movement In 1919, with the emergence of an organized revolutionary socialist Left Wing faction in the Socialist Party, Cohen cast his lot with the insurgents. In January 1919 a joint meeting of representatives of all the SP branches of Local Greater New York was called. The meeting was chaired by Julius Gerber, Executive Secretary of Local Greater New York who did his best to steer the meeting away from the passionate discussion of strategy and tactics which the Left Wing members desired. When delegates from Queens attempted to win the floor at 11:30 pm, only to be ruled out of order, a number of radicals bolted the hall and gathered in a meeting room of their own. A City Committee of 14 was elected, with Max Cohen as Executive Secretary. The group was to compose a manifesto and wage a campaign to win over the rank and file of the party to the ideas of revolutionary socialism. It was this group which wrote the famous Left Wing Manifesto, a document extensively revised by Louis C. Fraina, editor of the weekly newspaper of the Left Wing Section, Local Boston, The Revolutionary Age.Theodore Draper, The Roots of American Communism. New York: Viking, 1957. Page 145. Later in 1919, Left Wing Section, Local New York decided to issue its own weekly newspaper, The New York Communist. Max Cohen was made business manager of the new paper, which was edited by the celebrated journalist and war correspondent John Reed. Cohen's stint in this capacity was brief, as he stepped down effective with the June 14, 1919, issue, with Ben Gitlow taking over the job.The entire run of The New York Communist was reissued in book and microfilm form in 1970 by the Greenwood Reprint Corporation of Westport, CT. Later in June 1919, the national Left Wing Section held an organizational Left Wing National Conference in New York City. There Cohen was elected Secretary of the governing National Council of this group. Cohen was one of those members of the National Council who sought to avoid a split of the emerging Communist movement by endorsing the convention call issued by the Socialist Party of Michigan and the language federations of the Socialist Party seeking the immediate establishment of a Communist Party of America in Chicago on September 1, 1919. On this matter he came into bitter disagreement with Reed, Gitlow, and other leading members of the Left Wing Section, who sought to fight for control of the Socialist Party at its 1919 Emergency National Convention, slated for August 30 in that same city. This disagreement over tactics led to the formation of two separate organizations ‚Äî the Communist Party of America (CPA) and the Communist Labor Party of America (CLP), groups which fought each other tooth and nail for the next two years before finally merging their forces permanently in the middle of 1922. Cohen was elected as a delegate to the founding convention of the CPA in September 1919 and served as a membe of the 9 member committee of the convention which wrote the CPA's program. He was also chosen as editor of the organization's official organ, a weekly newspaper published in New York and called The Communist. Cohen was elected a member of the governing Central Executive Committee of the CPA in 1920 and served on the \\"Executive Council\\" of that body which conducted day- to-day operations. He was the organizer for District II for that organization (New York City and environs) from January 1920 onwards as well as continuing to serve as the Editor in Chief for the organization. At the end of 1920, Cohen ‚Äî an extremely loyal supporter of the Communist International ‚Äî ran afoul with a majority group in the CPA which sought to delay merger with the successor to the CLP to maximize their factional advantage in a united organization. For his outspoken criticism of the party's disingenuous \\"unity\\" strategy, Cohen was stripped of his editorship and expelled from the party on January 16, 1921. The expelled loyalist Cohen was rewarded by the Comintern when its 3-man American Agency, given the task by Moscow of forging a unified Communist Party in the USA and developing sister organizations in Mexico and South America, sent Cohen to Argentina to organize the framework of a Communist trade union movement in that country. It is unknown whether Cohen achieved anything in this role. Later years Cohen seems to have fallen out of the Communist Party's political leadership from that date. He periodically advertised his dentistry services in the party press in ensuing years and resurfaced in 1933 as the head of the Rose Pastor Stokes Testimonial Committee, an offshoot of the Communist Party which held a benefit dinner on her behalf on April 4, 1933, in an effort to raise funds to pay for her treatment for cancer.See Rose Pastor Stokes Papers, available on microfilm.

Anderson was convicted and sentenced to prison in 1974 for tax crimes, extortion, and conspiracy. Education Anderson attended Metropolis High School in Metropolis, Illinois, a town on the southern tip of Illinois on the border with Kentucky. After high school Anderson served in the military during World War II eventually achieving the rank of Captain. In 1963 he graduated with his Juris Doctor from the Mount Vernon Law School, which is now known as the University of Baltimore. Career Early career Anderson was a member of the Baltimore County Council from 1958 until 1966, when he was elected as the 4th County Executive, replacing Spiro Agnew, who later ran for and was elected as the Governor of Maryland. While County Executive, Anderson was also a member of the Planning Board, the Recreation and Park Board, the Social Services Board, the Regional Planning Council, all from 1966 until 1974, and on the Governor's Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice from 1967 until 1971. In addition to his election positions, Dale Anderson also served as President of the Maryland Association of Counties in 1970 and was a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1970 until 1974. Era of corruption In March 1974, Dale Anderson was convicted in U.S. District Court on several counts, including 32 counts of extortion, tax evasion, and conspiracy. The trial lasted 10 weeks and centered on paybacks from contractors in exchange for contracts for state jobs. Anderson was sentenced to 5 years in prison, but only served a portion of that time. The conviction came during a decade-long era in Maryland politics when several prominent politicians were forced to resign and some served prison sentences. This included former Maryland Governor and Vice President Spiro Agnew, who resigned the Vice Presidency amid allegations of accepting bribes during his tenure as governor, followed later by Maryland Governor Marvin Mandel's imprisonment for mail fraud and racketeering. Other Maryland politicians that were convicted of various crimes were Anne Arundel County Executive Joseph W. Alton, Baltimore County State's Attorney Samuel Green, Baltimore State Senator Clarence Mitchell III, Speaker of the House of Delegates A. Gordon Boone, U.S. Senator Daniel B. Brewster, and State Delegate James A.

It is a courthouse for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington. Building history The Federal Building and U.S. Post Office in Spokane, Washington, opened in October 1909. It was the first major federal building constructed in the \\"Inland Empire\\" that encompasses portions of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. The growing city of Spokane needed a larger post office and space for Federal offices. The federal government acquired the West Riverside Avenue and Lincoln Street site in 1903 for a cost of $100,000. James Knox Taylor, Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury Department, designed the building in 1906 and 1907. Construction began in 1908 and was completed in 1909. President William Howard Taft visited the building just prior to its public opening in the fall of 1909. He praised the building's \\"simplicity, beauty and solidity\\" In early October, postal workers closed the old facility at Post street and Monroe Avenue and moved records and equipment to the new building in approximately two days with only minimal interruptions to patrons. Only four months after the post office opened, rats were discovered in the basement. To remedy the problem, seven cats were allowed to live in the building, and the postmaster received $18 annually for each cat's care and feeding. The cats lived in the post office for at least one year, although no one is sure when the rat problem was solved. As Spokane continued to grow and postal activity expanded, city officials realized the need to enlarge the building. The site directly north of the existing building was purchased and an addition was completed in 1941. The addition was designed by Louis A. Simon, Supervising Architect of the Public Buildings Administration of the Federal Works Administration. In 1994, a modernization effort was completed. High efficiency lighting, modern elevators, and new HVAC equipment were installed. Important interior public spaces also underwent renovation and restoration. The Federal Building and U.S. Post Office was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. In 2004, the building won The Office Building of the Year Award in the historic category from the Building Owners and Managers Association Northwest Region. Architecture The Federal Building and U.S. Post Office in Spokane, Washington, skillfully blends elements of two styles of architecture. Beaux Arts Classicism and Second Renaissance Revival were popular styles in the early years of the twentieth century. Both styles were often executed on monumental public buildings and feature rusticated ground floors and balustrades. The building's architect, James Knox Taylor, was a strong proponent of architecture inspired by Classical forms and ornamentation, which he believed appropriately conveyed the dignity of the federal government. The exterior is finely detailed and proportioned. The symmetrical facade has a granite-faced basement level capped by a granite water table. The first story is clad in rusticated limestone and is dominated by arched openings. Cartouches (scrolled ovals) separate the first and second stories. The second and third stories are covered with smooth limestone and feature prominent Tuscan pilasters (attached columns) between window bays. The facade is topped with an entablature with a smooth frieze and medallions. The cornice contains a dentil course of small squares, a common feature on classical buildings. A parapet wall with a balustrade sits above the entablature. The addition that was completed in 1941 blends harmoniously with the original 1909 building. Louis A. Simon, who designed the addition, appreciated both Modern and Colonial Revival forms of architecture. However, Simon designed the addition using Beaux Arts Classicism and Second Renaissance Revival styles to complement the existing building. Similar massing, material, and architectural details provide continuity. The interior contains several ornate spaces. The first floor of the building contains formal public spaces such as the lobby, elevator vestibule, and main staircase. These areas have impressive proportions and finishes. Marble pilasters, floors, and wainscot; decorative plaster wall panels and coffered (recessed) ceilings; and terrazzo flooring are present. The federal district courtroom and its lobby, which are located on the third floor, underwent renovation and restoration work in 1994. Marble floors and walls are located in the lobby, and the courtroom features rich details such as Ionic pilasters and decorative plasterwork. An oval skylight is set within an oval dome in the courtroom. Original stained oak rails, benches, and desks remain. Offices are on the second and third floors. Wide corridors with terrazzo floors and marble baseboards separate perimeter offices from interior light courts. In addition to the ornate spaces, the building contained a common feature in post offices of the era. The \\"sneak hole\\" was a specially constructed, enclosed gallery located above the postal workroom that allowed inspectors to secretly observe the actions of employees through strategically placed peep holes. The \\"sneak hole\\" is no longer in use today.

Building history According to local tradition, the Federal Office Building in Seattle is located on the site where city founders A. A. Denny, William Bell, and C. D. Boren docked their boat after making initial surveys of Puget Sound and its harbors in 1851. On June 6, 1889, the Great Seattle Fire, which destroyed more than of the commercial district, started in a cabinet shop at the site of the Federal Office Building. The Rainier Grand Hotel circa 1905 The block was quickly rebuilt with a wall of 4-story buildings including the massive Grand Hotel, later known as the Rainier Grand. After the fire downtown Seattle took on a much more metropolitan air, and in 1897 its port became the \\"Gateway to Alaska\\" for steamships bearing prospectors bound for Alaska and the Klondike Gold Rush. The city's population burgeoned, and the federal government decided to consolidate the location of its services. In 1928, Congress approved more than $2 million for site acquisition and construction. Officials selected a site bounded by Madison and Marion streets and First and Western avenues. The building was designed between 1930 and 1931 by the Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore. One of the earliest federal buildings in the Art Deco style of architecture, the building's design was a departure from the more traditional styles of Classical Revival and Beaux Arts Classicism and a step toward more modern architectural styles that were gaining popularity. However, the building retains conventional symmetrical massing and proportion. Construction was completed in 1933 by the Murch Construction Company of St. Louis, Missouri. The building used substantial amounts of aluminum from smelters along the nearby Columbia River. It was the first building in Seattle designed specifically to house offices for the federal government. Among its first tenants were 52 federal agencies, the largest of which was the Department of the Treasury. Today, the building is located among three significant historic areas: Pioneer Square, Pike Place Market, and the waterfront. The Henry M. Jackson Federal Building, located across the street, was constructed from 1975 to 1976. In 1979, the Federal Office Building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Architecture The Federal Office Building is an exuberant example of Art Deco architecture. One of the earliest Modern styles, Art Deco architecture emphasizes verticality and is heavily ornamented with stylized, geometric motifs. The facade is stepped, with the outer portions rising from six stories to nine stories, while the central tower reaches eleven stories in height. The tower is topped by a ziggurat (stepped pyramid) with a flagpole at its apex. Corner towers rise slightly above the ridgeline. The building is constructed of a steel frame encased in concrete for additional fire protection. The design is also notable for its use of aluminum, which was installed as cast spandrel panels between windows on the third through sixth floors. The panels, which depict either insignia of various federal agencies or decorative geometric designs, were one of the earliest substantial uses of aluminum on a West Coast building. The building rests atop a granite foundation. Smooth terracotta, which lends the appearance of stone, covers the first story and is punctuated by segmental-arch openings on the facade. The midsection is clad in light red brick and is topped by elaborate stylized ornamentation executed in pale terra cotta. On the facade, three centrally located entrances are articulated by vertical pale terra-cotta ornamentation that includes miniature ram and lion heads. A stylized eagle motif is centrally placed above the entrance, and bronze lanterns provide light. Two five-foot-tall, cast-bronze urns, which were relocated from the 1909 Alaska‚ÄìYukon‚ÄìPacific Exposition, flank the entrance. They feature stylized geometric decorations. Often, the rear elevations of buildings are less visible and therefore less ornamented, but because the rear of the Federal Office Building faces Western Avenue, an important thoroughfare, all elevations are extensively detailed. The building's cornerstone and two plaques commemorating the Great Seattle Fire of 1889 are located near where the fire began. Interior public spaces are heavily ornamented with Art Deco materials and motifs. Access is gained through the First Avenue entrance into a vestibule with cast-bronze moldings and bronze- and-glass doors which lead to a public lobby and the post office. The public lobby floor is covered with dark red terra-cotta tile with cross strips and baseboards of Tokeen marble from Alaska. Walls are clad in light gray Wilkeson sandstone, and a coffered ceiling tops the space. Several original bronze, reverse-pyramid light fixtures remain in the lobby. A nearby elevator lobby has four elevators with original cast-bronze doors bearing floral Art Deco motifs. At the north end of the vestibule is the U.S. Post Office, which is reached through an opening flanked by stained oak pilasters (attached columns). The postal lobby, which is nearly unchanged since building construction, is one of the most significant interior spaces. Two original postal service windows are cased in stained oak with simple scroll brackets and carved lintels. The floor is covered in polished, dark red, terra-cotta tile with a coved base molding. Stained oak, tongue-in-groove wainscot reaches a height of three feet around the perimeter of the postal lobby and is capped by a stained oak rail. Above the rail, plaster walls are finished in a heavily stippled texture. Plaster cove molding tops the walls and has a fruit-and-leaf design.

McEwen United States Custom House, also known as U.S. Customshouse, is a historic customshouse building located at Ogdensburg in St. Lawrence County, New York. It was built in 1809-1810 as a store and warehouse. It is a two-story, utilitarian, gable roofed, stone bearing wall structure approximately 60 feet wide and 120 feet long. The Federal government purchased it in 1936 and converted it for use as a customshouse. See also: It is the oldest within the building inventory of the General Services Administration. Building history Ogdensburg served as a regional distribution center during the early nineteenth century. Goods were brought to upper New York State via the St. Lawrence River and warehoused here, making the town a trade hub. The U.S. Custom House building originally served as a store and warehouse. It was known as the Parish Store and Wharf in reference to its first owner, David Parish. Parish, a German financier who immigrated to the United States in 1808, engaged master carpenter Daniel W. Church to oversee construction of the building. In 1811, Congress established the U.S. Customs District of Oswegatchie (an Iroquois word meaning ‚Äúat the very outlet‚Äù). According to local tradition, the Parish Store housed U.S. Customs Service functions by 1811 and this arrangement continued for almost sixty years. In 1870, Alfred B. Mullet, Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury, designed a new building to house the custom house and post office. Located at 431 State Street in downtown Ogdensburg, the building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 and continues to function as a post office. The George Hall Corporation, a shipping company, owned the Parish Store from 1880 to 1936. Likely due to needs for additional space, in 1928, the U.S. Customs Service moved back into leased space in the Parish Store. In 1936, the Hall Corporation sold the building to the U.S. government for $65,000. The building was renamed the U.S. Custom House. Over the years, the building was used for customs offices, patrol assembly, radio, record, and customs files rooms, a dormitory for immigration officers, and detention facilities. The U.S. Army, Air Force, and Marines also maintained offices here. Listed in the National Register in 1974, the building was renamed in honor of the late Robert C. McEwen, a U.S. Congressman, in 1982. Architecture The U. S. Custom House is a fine example of the utilitarian buildings constructed in native limestone in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in the Ogdensburg region. Master carpenter Daniel W. Church supervised a group of French Canadian stonemasons who came from Montreal to work on its construction. The original building has excellent proportions (60 feet wide and 120 feet long) giving it a visual sense of lightness. While the original warehouse building began as a simple, unadorned, vernacular building, extensive modifications, undertaken in the 1930s, incorporated Colonial Revival-style elements. These consist of scaled door and window openings with elliptical arches, decorative cornice, dormers, and porch. The building's core massing and roof remains much the same as when constructed in 1809‚Äì1810, save for the addition of shed dormers. At the front (east) facade the U.S. Custom House is a three-story, side-gabled building. As the site slopes to the west, the basement is exposed on other sides. Constructed of native limestone laid as fieldstone, with quoins at each corner, the building's load-bearing masonry walls are three feet thick in places. All masonry openings have segmental arches with voussoirs (wedge-shaped stones) of matching limestone. After purchasing the building in 1936, the federal government modified the exterior and interior to reflect the popular Colonial Revival style of the period. Dormers and cornices supported by modillions (scroll-shaped brackets) were added. Most of the large loading doors were partially filled in with limestone and converted to paired windows. In 1958, a simple, one-story portico, similar to one constructed in 1937 and later removed, was added to the north Water Street side of the building. A small limestone addition was built at the southwest corner. These exterior modifications were done with restraint and sensitivity, leaving the character of the building largely intact, while accommodating its new use. The building interior dates entirely from 1937, when a complete remodeling was undertaken at a cost of $125,000 to provide offices for the U.S. Customs Service. Vestiges of the 1809‚Äì1810 structure remain in transverse load-bearing masonry walls, the closets under the eaves of the third floor, and the original beams. Distinctive interior features include the vestibule, lobby and information desk, center stairway, cashier's office, and public and private collectors offices. From the main entry on the front facade, a small vestibule opens into the lobby. In the lobby are bulletin cases of glass and wood marked ‚ÄúImmigration‚Äù and ‚ÄúCustoms,‚Äù and a wood building directory. A recessed area contains a wood-panel information desk with a hinged gate. In the wall behind the desk, a shallow, elaborately detailed closet was built into one of the original arches in the masonry bearing wall. The first-floor corridor opens off the lobby and is T-shaped, with painted plaster walls and ceiling. There are original (1937) wood baseboards and chair rail with abstracted triglyph (three vertical band) design. The ceilings of the lobby have a molded plaster cornice; the corridor ceilings have a plain cornice band. At the westernmost end of the east-west corridor is a built-in, paneled wooden service counter. The counter is enclosed with a centered operable window, flanked by two fixed windows. This is the original site of the cashier's office. Significant events Robert C.

The original building was the Brooklyn General Post Office, and is now the Downtown Brooklyn Station, and the north addition is the courthouse for the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York, and is across the street from and in the jurisdiction of the main courthouse of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the Theodore Roosevelt Federal Courthouse. It also houses offices for the United States Attorney, In 2009, the United States Congress enacted legislation renaming the building the Conrad B. Duberstein United States Bankruptcy Courthouse,H.R.430 -- To designate the United States bankruptcy courthouse located at 271 Cadman Plaza East in Brooklyn, New York, as the 'Conrad B. Duberstein United States Bankruptcy Courthouse' in honor of chief bankruptcy judge Conrad B. Duberstein. History Planning and design for the new post office began in 1885. During his three-year tenure (1884‚Äì86), Mifflin E. Bell, supervising architect of the U.S. Treasury Department, designed the building in the Romanesque Revival style of architecture. The building originally functioned as both a post office and courthouse with four courtrooms. Much of the original appropriation for the building was allotted for the purchase of the lot, which is bounded by Cadman Plaza East (then Washington Street), p.583 Johnson, Adams, and Tillary streets. After Bell's resignation, his design was revised by his successor, William A. Freret, whose final design was a much bolder Romanesque building than Bell had envisioned. Still, some of the more elaborate architectural details of Bell's original design, such as larger corner towers, were never executed in the final design. Construction was completed in 1891; interior spaces were finished in 1892 and the building was occupied. Shortly thereafter, three passenger elevators and a mail lift were installed. As the population continued to grow, officials determined more space was needed. Because the original building only occupied the southern half of the lot, the addition extended to the north. In 1930, the Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore, designed a compatible addition in a similar style, which was completed in 1933. p.237 Two new courtrooms were added as part of the expansion. The U.S. General Post Office was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1966 and listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. In 1999 the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) purchased the building and began extensive renovations that included the addition of new courtrooms and the restoration of historic courtrooms, original windows, numerous site features, and interior and exterior materials. It now houses postal services as well as the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the U.S. Trustee, and the Offices of the U.S. Attorney. Architecture The building is an excellent example of Romanesque Revival architecture and is a prominent component of the Municipal Center complex. The original portion of the building is four stories in height and the 1933 addition is seven stories tall. The exterior has remained largely unchanged over time. The lively design of the building contains many character-defining features of the Romanesque Revival style. The central structure contains strong, simple forms with powerful arches dominating the first story. Elaborate dormers, iron roof cresting, steeply pitched roofs, and a tower give the building a picturesque quality. The original building's tower on the southwest corner The exterior of the building is rich in material, texture, form, and ornament. Semi-circular projections called tourelles protrude from the building. Each level is articulated in a slightly different way and distinguished by belt courses that encircle the building. Round arches of polished granite, which feature rosettes and cable moldings, dominate the first story. The arches spring from carved posts with foliated motifs. Rectangular windows surrounded by contrasting trim are on the second floor, while round-arch openings are on the third floor. The fourth story contains steeply pitched dormers with round-arch windows. A slate-covered mansard roof is topped with ornamental ironwork cresting. The square corner tower rises above the roofline of the original building. Arched openings with semi-circular balconies are topped by an ornate cornice surmounted by a steeply pitched pyramidal roof. One of the most significant interior spaces is the atrium. It is located in the center of the 1892 portion of the building and extends from the second to fourth floors. The atrium is enclosed by a three-level loggia. Each level of the loggia is supported by cast-iron columns that are adorned with acanthus and anthemion leaf motifs. The main staircase is in the northeast corner of the original building. A decorative cast-iron balustrade with lantern-style newel posts encases soapstone treads. The stairwell walls are clad in mahogany Tennessee marble wainscot, and the floors are covered with black and white marble tiles laid on the diagonal. The central section of the original building The walls of the 1892 courtrooms are also covered with mahogany Tennessee marble wainscot with black soap-stone bands with a marble bead. Large round-arch windows have carved wood mullions and are operated by cast-metal pulls with griffin-head motifs. One of the courtrooms contains a marble and soapstone fireplace, which has a carved leaf pattern and marble mantel. Fireplaces are also in some of the original office spaces. Some interior spaces have been altered over time. During World War II, a skylight and laylight that originally illuminated the postal work floor were covered to comply with black-out laws implemented to protect the country from enemy bombings. In 1980, the monumental lobby of the original building was altered and most features removed. To accommodate the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and U.S. Attorneys, GSA began an extensive renovation project in 1999. A U-shaped green-glass and aluminum curtain wall was added to the 1933 portion of the building in 2003, forming an interior atrium that, along with new skylights, admits natural light. GSA also refurbished interior stone, metal, plaster, and wood finishes; restored historic windows and doors; and added three new courtrooms. On the exterior, the cast-iron roof cresting was repaired and historically appropriate street-lights were installed on the site. The design, which was completed by R.M. Kliment & Frances Halsband Architects, received a 1998 Design Award citation from GSA. Between 2010 and 2013 the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) oversaw the substantial exterior restoration of the Courthouse, to protect the award-winning interior renovation. The lead architect was Goody Clancy of Boston and the prime contractor Nicholson & Galloway. Lend Lease led the construction management team as a full participant from the initial investigation through construction documentation and construction phase services with respect to historic preservation, value engineering, and commissioning services. The work included restoring or replacing of the granite and terracotta facades, including nearly 16,000 terracotta units, as well as of slate roof and 1,200 wood windows. SUPERSTRUCTURES Engineers + Architects provided commissioning services, which involved individually tracking each element of the building envelope during construction. The project was awarded a GSA Design Award ‚Äì Citation in Preservation (2016) and the prestigious Lucy G. Moses Preservation Award from the New York Landmarks Conservancy (2014) and the Silver Reconstruction Award from Building Design + Construction Magazine.

Education A native of Johnstown, Roddy was born the 4th of 5 children to an Irish American family. His father, Robert Roddy, Sr., was a steelworker and negotiator for the United Steelworkers of America. He attended St. Benedict‚Äôs parochial school in Geistown, Pennsylvania. He attended University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown. As a student, he took a part-time job as a newswriter at WJAC-TV and later the Nanty Glo Journal and the Portage Dispatch. Career Following graduation, Roddy accepted a position at the Tribune- Review in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, a position he held for 8 years before joining the Pittsburgh Press as a political reporter. In 1992, the financially ailing paper was purchased by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and Roddy joined its staff. In 1996, the Scripps Howard News Service began syndicating his political column across a dozen newspapers across the country. An August 1998 profile of Roddy in Pittsburgh City Paper described him as having a knack for \\"getting into places other reporters find unobtainable -- the USAir jet crash site, President Clinton's limousine, a hotel elevator with presidential candidate Gary Hart and an attractive young woman.\\" The article said that Roddy's \\"wit, his storytelling skills, his Irishness, infuse the paper. Readers -- whether they notice his name on top of stories or not -- gain their impression of what's going on around Pittsburgh, what's amusing and what's tragic about it, from Roddy. Many of the stories he tells linger in the mind a long time.\\" His notable articles have included a profile of Jerry Bowyer, Joe Waldholtz's financial crimes, and a powerful article describing an 8-year- old's testimony in a rape trial. In 1994, his award-winning article The Messenger Boys provided a first-hand account of an Irish Republican Army bomb attack in Belfast that killed 10. The City Paper article noted that he has \\"gone further than most reporters would dare in writing about his own family life,\\" including familial discord and his Irish Catholic upbringing. In September 2007, Roddy wrote an article about the impending divorce between Pittsburgh billionaire newspaper publisher Richard Mellon Scaife and his wife Margaret Ritchie Battle Scaife. The reporting in the article was supported by documents that Roddy obtained from documents inadvertently published on the internet by the Allegheny County Family Court. Scaife's suit and criminal complaints against Roddy were thrown out of court. Other writings and awards Roddy wrote the foreword to the book Pennsylvania 24/7 by Rick Smolan and David Elliot Cohen. His work has been cited in A Force Upon the Plain by Kenneth S. Stern, The Hunting of the President by Joe Conason and Gene Lyons, and Blood and Politics by Leonard Zeskind. In 2000, he was named \\"top columnist in the nation\\" by the Scripps Howard Foundation and he was named \\"top humor columnist\\" by the National Society of Newspaper Columnists and the three times by the Western Pennsylvania Press Club. In 2004, he received an \\"Honorable Mention\\" Keystone Press Award for his column from the Pennsylvania Newspaper Association. In 2005, he was named one of \\"Pennsylvania's Most Influential Reporters\\" by the Pennsylvania political news website PoliticsPA.

It is the second spin-off of the Time Crisis series published by Namco after Crisis Zone. Razing Storm was released for the PlayStation 3 as Time Crisis: Razing Storm in North America, and as Big 3 Gun Shooting in Japan in October 2010, and features support for the PlayStation Move controller and Namco Guncon 3 controller. Plot Razing Storm's story places in the year 2030, with the players - referred to as Alpha One and Alpha Two in-game - in a massively destructible environment to fight futuristic terrorists and renegade soldiers in South America, which is under a bloody revolution, as part of a special forces unit called S.C.A.R. (Strategic Combat and Rescue), sent to capture the leader of the rebels, Paulo Guerra, who masterminded an attack on the United States. Guerra's schemes are shrouded in mystery, as much of his doings are unraveled in the PlayStation 3 version of the game, which also wraps up the cliffhanger from the Arcade release. Gameplay Razing Storm is similar to many of its Time Crisis rail shooter counterparts, namely Crisis Zone, using the signature foot pedal cover system, but providing the player with a machine gun as the default weapon and a handheld ballistic shield. Pressing down on the pedal allows the player to lower the shield and attack, but leaves them open to enemy fire. Releasing the pedal allows the player to raise the shield, reloading their weapon and rendering the player impervious to all conventional types of damage, but leaves them unable to attack. The game also has a time limit on each section. This forces the player to attack and take risks rather than spend too much time hiding behind their shield, or they will face damage from events that occur when from the timer runs out. Players have a limited number of life marks (a default setting of three) and one mark is taken away for every hit of damage they take and whenever the timer runs out. A one-half mark is taken away for accidentally shooting a civilian in certain situations, but several one-half marks can be earned (even above the default amount) by covering allied squad members in other situations. When the life marks drop to zero or below, the game is over. Different from most Time Crisis games, clear warnings are given when an enemy has locked-on and is about to attack, usually in the form of a shrinking crosshair mark around an enemy's gun, or a yellow triangle around flying projectiles. As the player keeps progressing without taking damage, the warning time shrinks and projectiles travel faster, forcing the player to defend much more quickly and efficiently to avoid damage while moving forward, much like the Virtua Cop series. Unlike its Time Crisis counterparts, Razing Storm puts a unique emphasis on the player's score and performance, with frequent checkpoints, score reports, and commentary for hit chains to let the player know how he's doing, and how he compares to other players before him. As the player scores continuous hits on enemies in short periods of time, his hit counter increases, giving score bonuses and compliments from other characters at certain milestones (Scoring a 50, 100, 150 hit chain, etc.). The hit counter/chain is also added to and extended by destroying the surrounding environment, such as shooting out windows, railings, fruit stands, and concrete barriers. Large score bonuses are also given for quick completion of areas, as a time bonus, and for destroying environmental hazards that harm enemies. This scoring system gives players incentive to attack and shoot continuously and recklessly, taking risks for a high score, rather than playing defensively to simply complete the game. Razing Storm has 4 stages of gameplay, in which playing all four stages is contingent on how well the player performed. Players must encounter militias, rogue troopers, and mechanized enemies throughout. Players are also given four different weapons, based on the situation that the player is facing. Originally an arcade game, Razing Storm was released as a part of Time Crisis: Razing Storm for the PlayStation 3. In the PlayStation 3 port, a First-Person Shooting Story Mode (similar to Time Crisis 4's Full Mission) covers cliffhangers and plot holes purposely omitted from the arcade version.

Foley United States Courthouse is a stone Art Deco federal courthouse, located on Broadway (New York State Route 32) in downtown Albany, New York, United States. Built in the 1930s, it was included in 1980 as a contributing property when the Downtown Albany Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2020 it was listed on the Register individually as the United States Post Office, Court House, and Custom House. The building houses courtrooms and chambers of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, offices of the district's U.S. Attorney, and the local offices of several federal law enforcement agencies. For 60 years after its construction it served as Albany's main post office as well. It was designed and constructed under the supervision of consulting architect Electus Darwin Litchfield and built by the Kenny Brothers Construction Company. Building history In 1930, Congress allocated $3.325 million for the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase a site and construct a new federal building in Albany, New York, to house a post office, courthouse, and custom house. The following year, the government chose a location on the southeast corner of Broadway and Maiden Lane and subsequently demolished several existing buildings to prepare the site for new construction. The Office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury selected the prominent local architectural firm Gander, Gander & Gander to design the building under the Public Buildings Act of 1926, which gave treasury officials the option of hiring private architects for federal projects. Norman R. Sturgis served as associate architect. Notable New York City architect Electus Darwin Litchfield, who began his career with the renowned firm of Carr√®re and Hastings before establishing his own practice, served as consulting architect on the project and contributed major design concepts and aesthetic refinements. The architects designed the building in the Art Deco style, which was simultaneously Modern and decorative. When discussing the building, the architects used the term \\"modern classical\\" to describe their innovative design, instructing observers to \\"Squint your eyes, look in perspective and note the classical proportions of the building--minus columns and entablature.\\"General Services Administration page on the James T. Foley United States Courthouse. The architects completed their plans in 1931 and the following year, the government awarded the construction contract to Kenny Brothers, Inc., of New York City. Prominent officials and the public gathered for a cornerstone-laying ceremony on August 18, 1933, and construction was completed in 1934, for a cost of $3,325,000 ($1,510,000 for the site and $1,815,000 for construction). The building had an exterior bridge connecting the nearby rail station with the post office, which occupied the entire first two floors. In 1980, the building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing building to the Downtown Albany Historic District. In 1988, it was renamed to honor Judge James Thomas Foley (1910-1990), who President Harry Truman appointed to the Northern District of New York in 1949. Foley served the federal courts for forty years, including a period as chief judge from 1963-1980 and senior judge from 1980 until his death. The post office vacated the building in 1995. Current tenants include the U.S. District Northern Division of New York State, U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, United States Marshals Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the FBI. Architecture The courthouse is an excellent example of Art Deco architecture, which incorporated sleek Modern forms while retaining ornate yet stylized decorative elements. The architects utilized high-quality materials on both the interior and exterior. The walls rest on a Bethel White granite base and are faced with Vermont Eureka marble above the water table. The building is built around two light courts that admit natural light into the interior. Vertical bands of windows with aluminum muntins emphasize the height of the five-story building. Black structural glass spandrels separate the windows on the facade. The facade, which faces west on Broadway, contains two entrances, each topped with an eagle that is more than eight feet tall and carved from a seventeen-ton Vermont marble block by New York City sculptor Albert T. Stewart, who also received the commission for the building's frieze. Artist Benjamin Hawkins created ornate aluminum screens titled Departments of Government located behind the eagles. The screens contain stylized motifs representing the Departments of Navy, Agriculture, Labor, Army, Post Office, Commerce and Revenue, as well as images of the courts, thirteen stars representing the original colonies, and the New York state seal. A bas-relief frieze encircles the building on three elevations: the west facade contains images of postal service activities, the north elevation shows customs duties, and the south elevation illustrates the mission of the courts. To make the carvings visible to street-level viewers, Stewart created figures approximately eight feet tall and executed at a depth of nearly three inches. Typical of the Art Deco style, the architects designed an opulent interior. Six marble types, including St. Genevieve Golden Vein, Rose, Champlain Black, Eagle Grey Tennessee, Eagle Pink Tennessee, and Verde Antique, are used on the richly appointed interior walls and floors. Ceilings are ornate plaster with medallions and stepped molding covered with aluminum leaf. Entrance vestibules lead to public lobbies with marble walls. Marble mosaic medallions are inset in the north and south lobby floors. A gilded plaster ceiling medallion of the United States Seal is centered in the lobby and framed by step moldings covered with aluminum leaf and gold stars. Marble pilasters divide the main lobby into nine bays, each articulated with a ceiling mural. Artist Ethel M. Parsons painted the oil-on-canvas murals in 1935, depicting each of the seven continents as well as the North Pole and the United States. Interspersed with the murals are plaster plaques by Italian artist Enea Biafora Portraying famous Americans, including Abraham Lincoln, Benjamin Franklin, and George Washington, as portrayed on the earliest U.S. postage stamps. With the exception of the murals, the ceiling is covered with aluminum leaf. Four original black marble writing desks are centered in the main lobby. Throughout the building, in both public and private spaces, intricate wood inlay designs adorn the ceiling and wall trim. Each of the five floors contains two elevator lobbies with adjacent public staircases. The stairs have treads and landings of Eagle Grey Tennessee marble with Champlain black marble risers. Cast- aluminum railings, also designed by Biafora, contain stylized motifs related to the functions of the building, including an airplane and scales of justice. The two original courtrooms retain many original finishes and features. Both feature elaborate ornamentation on the wood walls and plaster ceilings. Courtroom No. 1, used for District Court proceedings since its construction, has Oregon maple burl paneling with exotic wood inlays and decorative aluminum grilles. The Courtroom Lobby retains original radiator grilles, bronze Art Deco light fixtures, and marble floor and walls. Two black-and-gold marble benches provide seating. Courtroom No. 2 features walnut burl veneer walls and Art Deco wall sconces. When the post office vacated the building in 1995, much of their original workspace on the first and second floors was transformed to accommodate new uses, including renovated office space and the installation of a new courtroom.

Waddell formed and led a provincial militia unit in Rowan County, North Carolina and the Ohio River Valley during the French and Indian War and the Anglo-Cherokee War, and supervised the construction of Fort Dobbs near the settlement of the Fourth Creek Congregation. His career was well-served by close connections to several provincial governors of North Carolina. Early life Waddell was born around 1734 in Lisburn, County Down, Ireland, to Hugh and Isabella Brown Waddell who were of Ulster Protestant origin, although the exact date of his birth is unknown. As a family friend to the aristocrat Arthur Dobbs of County Antrim, who had just been appointed as Governor of North Carolina, Waddell was sent to the colonies in 1753 or 1754, and enlisted in the service of the acting Governor, Matthew Rowan, as a lieutenant. French and Indian War career An excerpt from the 1770 map of North Carolina by John Collet, depicting the location of Waddell's property on the northwest branch of the Cape Fear River In 1754, Waddell was sent to Virginia under the command of Colonel James Innes, who was commander-in-chief of all colonial forces then in Virginia under the authority of the governor of that state, Robert Dinwiddie. After seeing no action, but having been promoted to captain, Waddell returned to North Carolina in late 1754, where he then spent a substantial portion of the early phase of the war that would go on to define his career as a commander supervising the construction, maintenance, and staffing of Fort Dobbs, near what is now Statesville, North Carolina. In 1756, Waddell was recruited by Virginia's Lieutenant Governor Robert Dinwiddie to serve as a \\"Commissioner of Peace\\" to the Cherokee and Catawba tribes. Waddell was the sole representative of North Carolina in these negotiations, which secured the temporary cooperation of those tribes against the French and their native allies. In 1758, Waddell, then a major, was called by General John Forbes to command a force of 300 rangers in the Forbes Expedition, with the goal of capturing Fort Duquesne. Initially acting as scouts and camp guards, Waddell's rangers were among several advanced units ambushed on 14 September 1758, by a raiding party of Shawnee and Delaware warriors. Waddell's unit successfully defended itself, although other units that were attacked simultaneously broke and fled. On 12 November 1758, General Forbes ordered Colonel George Washington to command a force of Virginian and Carolinian troops to assault Fort Duquesne. Over the course of four days, Waddell and his troops fought off advanced groups of native French-allied warriors. By 24 November 1758, Waddell and his scouting force arrived to find that Fort Duquesne had been destroyed by the fleeing French soldiers, who had decided to abandon the fort in the face of the Forbes Expedition's methodical attack. After the conclusion of the Forbes Expedition, Waddell was given a Colonel's commission and, with his rangers, returned to Fort Dobbs to defend the Carolina territory against the increasingly belligerent Cherokee. Anglo- Cherokee War Waddell was stationed at Fort Dobbs on the night of 27 February 1760 when a force of Cherokee attacked the blockhouse. In the ensuing battle, which was the only battle that occurred at Fort Dobbs, between 10 and 12 Cherokee and two Provincial soldiers were wounded. War of the Regulation After the Treaty of Paris, Waddell led provincial militia in support of Governor William Tryon, and therefore against the \\"Regulation\\" movement during the War of the Regulation, although he did not take part in the Battle of Alamance due to having been encircled by Regulator militia near Salisbury, North Carolina. Governor Tryon's march westward to confront the Regulators was, in part, due to his desire to lift the siege on General Waddell. Later life, death, and reputation Waddell served at various times in the North Carolina Legislature representing Rowan County, although his primary residences were in Bladen County and Brunswick County. Despite his prior allegiances to Governors Dobbs and Tryon, he was passed over for an appointment to North Carolina's Governor's Council, the primary advisory body to the colonial Governor. During this time, Waddell assisted in the establishment of a Sons of Liberty organization based around the Wilmington area, and participated in protests against the Stamp Act of 1765. Waddell died after a prolonged battle with an illness on 9 April 1773, in Castle Hayne, North Carolina where he is buried. Hugh Waddell served as a Captain with the Rowan County Regiment of the North Carolina militia during the American Revolution in 1776. He was involved in the construction of Davidson's Fort in western North Carolina.Lewis, list of captains General Waddell was an ancestor of James Iredell Waddell, a Confederate captain during the Civil War, as well as Alfred Moore Waddell, a United States Congressman from North Carolina who wrote and published a biography of the General in 1890. In his biography, Alfred Waddell noted that the General had served longer in the military service of the crown than any other officer of the province, and as such was its most prominent soldier.

He and his parents later established a homeless shelter, Trevor's Place. His parents also authored a book, also called Trevor's Place, to further describe the actions thus accomplished, with a plea for further action. It was published in 1985. Trevor Farrell's work was recognized by President Ronald Reagan in the President's 1986 State of the Union address. A TV movie dramatizing the shelter's activities, titled Christmas on Division Street, aired in 1991. It featured actor Fred Savage as Trevor.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101580/ A 1994 episode of the series Lifestories: Families in Crisis, titled Brotherly Love: The Trevor Ferrell Story, also described his efforts.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0394769/ When Trevor was 18, the family discontinued its efforts in the campaign.

Moss United States Courthouse in 1933. The Frank E. Moss United States Courthouse (originally known as the United States Post Office and Courthouse) is a historic United States federal courthouse and federal building in Salt Lake City, Utah. The courthouse is located in Salt Lake's Exchange Place Historic District. It is the oldest building among eight buildings (all constructed between 1903 and 1917) that make up that district. The building reflect Utah's growing prosperity at the beginning of the twentieth century.Building Overview, General Services Administration. Until 2014, the courthouse housed most operations of the United States District Court for the District of Utah. The court eventually outgrew the courthouse, and a new, modern-style $186 million courthouse, the U.S. Courthouse for the District of Utah, was built adjacent to the Moss Courthouse. Most court operations moved to the new courthouse, which opened in 2014. However, the United States bankruptcy court for Utah remains at the Moss Courthouse. Other federal agencies (which had been housed in leased space) were also relocated to the Moss Courthouse.Keith McCord, Nearly completed federal courthouse designed to maximize security, natural lighting, KSL (September 13, 2013). Building history After Utah was admitted to the Union in 1896, planning began for a federal building in the capital city. The following year, Congress appropriated $500,000 for site acquisition and building construction. The selected site was purchased from two local bankers, the Walker brothers, for one silver dollar on November 21, 1899.General Service Administration page on the Frank E. Moss United States Courthouse]. The Classical Revival style building was designed by the Office of the Supervising Architect of the United States Department of the Treasury headed by James Knox Taylor. Construction began in the summer of 1902. Flaws in the stonework delayed construction, but the United States Post Office and Courthouse was finished in late 1905. An addition, which echoed the style of the original building, was constructed on its west (rear) side between 1910 and 1912. In the late 1920s another addition was planned under the direction of Louis A. Simon, Superintendent of the Architectural Section of the Treasury Department. The design was intended to duplicate the earlier facades, but an unforeseen problem arose. During construction of the building's final addition, extensive cracking and spalling were discovered in the soft Kyune sandstone that faced the 1905 and 1912 sections. As a consequence, the addition was constructed entirely in granite and nearly all the existing facades were refaced to match. Work was completed in 1932. In 1990 the courthouse was renamed in honor of Frank Edward Moss, a Utah native who served as United States Senator from 1959 to 1977. The Exchange Place Historic District, including the Frank E. Moss U.S. Courthouse, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. This district is also listed as a historic landmark on the Salt Lake Register of Cultural Resources. Architecture Located on Main Street in Salt Lake City's Exchange Place Historic District, the courthouse helped introduce the Classical Revival style to Utah. The original building was constructed between 1902 and 1905 with a U-shaped plan. The two additions, completed in 1912 and 1932, closed the end of the U and added another U-shaped section. Together they form a plan with a figure-eight shape, enclosing a pair of light courts. When the last addition was constructed, the Classical Revival style was reinterpreted as a form of modern classicism that was prevalent for many public buildings of the 1930s. The building rises five full stories above a basement and has a central two-story penthouse. The exterior walls of the 1905 and 1912 sections were originally clad in Kyune sandstone that experienced significant cracking and other damage over the years. These walls were refaced with Utah granite during the construction of the final addition. The only original sandstone wall surface remaining is on one of the eight internal light court elevations. Because much of the original sandstone was replaced in 1932, the classically designed exterior displays elements of stylized modern classicism. Broad granite steps lead from the street to the courthouse's main entrance, along its east elevation. Flanking the steps are granite railings with streamlined detailing and eagles with outstretched wings. Atop the bronze entry doors are elaborate decorative grilles of bronze and aluminum. A colonnade of fifteen fluted, engaged Doric columns spans the eastern facade, supporting a classical entablature and parapet with balustrade. Three-story high window openings are recessed behind the columns. In each bay, just below the third floor, is a decorative metal screen set on marble backing. The north elevation is similar in style but not as wide with seven columns and ten window bays. Its three westernmost bays have wood spandrels and pediments in place of marble-backed metal screens. The south elevation, also ten bays wide, is simpler in design, having rectangular pilasters rather than the engaged columns of the north and east elevations. The rear of the building, which faces west, presents the simplest elevation. It differs from the other three elevations, having neither columns nor pilasters, as it was intended to be the least visible when built. It is faced in yellow brick with a sandstone belt course. The north side of this elevation, which dates from the 1912 extension, has sandstone trim, while its south side, added in 1932, employs terra cotta for the window lintels and other elements. The internal light court elevations are also faced in yellow brick, except for the south elevation of the original building. It retains its intricately carved pilasters and capitals. This elevation originally faced the street. Inside the courthouse, the floors of the main lobby and corridors are a combination of marble, tile, and terrazzo. Marble wainscoting appears throughout the 1905 portion of the courthouse. Three original courtrooms, located on the second floor, have retained much of their original appearance. They are two stories high, with oak wainscot and paneling, as well as ornamental plaster ceilings with decorative coffers. Until 2014, the courthouse housed most operations of the United States District Court for the District of Utah. The court eventually outgrew the Moss Courthouse. A new, modern-style $186 million courthouse, the U.S. Courthouse for the District of Utah, was built adjacent to the old courthouse. Most court operations moved to the new courthouse, which opened in 2014. However, the United States bankruptcy court for Utah remains at the Moss Courthouse. Other federal agencies (which had been housed in leased space) were also relocated to the Moss Courthouse. While the new courthouse was being built, the Moss Courthouse underwent a simultaneous renovation, including interior alterations as well as upgrades to all major building systems.

Building history The oldest sections of Portland are centered west of the Willamette, and the courthouse is located in this area. Commonly referred to as the New Courthouse to distinguish it from nearby Pioneer County Courthouse (1869), the courthouse has housed such government offices as the downtown post office, the U.S. District Court, the U.S. Court of Appeals, and offices for the U.S. Secret Service and branches of the military. Whitehouse, a native Portland architect, developed the plans for the courthouse from directives formulated by federal agencies, with Jules Henri de Sibour of Washington, D.C., as the consulting architect and James A. Wetmore, the Supervising Architect of the Treasury. Ninety-two percent of all contract money available for labor and materials went to Portland and Seattle area firms, providing an economic boost to the region. In August 1932, the cornerstone was laid. Included in a metal box within the stone were five Portland daily newspapers, historic documents relating to the building, and a photograph of Whitehouse and the partners of his architectural firm. Construction proceeded smoothly, and a little more than a year later, in September 1933, the new federal courtrooms were officially opened. In 1989, the Courthouse was given its current name to honor Gus J. Solomon, a judge who served the U.S. District Court for 37 years ‚Äî longer than any other judge in Oregon. Architecture The courthouse viewed from Broadway The Gus J. Solomon U.S. Courthouse occupies an entire block, covering approximately 40,000 square feet. The massive building contains a full first floor only; the central interior space opens into a light court, giving the upper stories of the building a square plan with a hollow center. The exterior of the building is faced with a veneer of light gray Wilkeson sandstone, described as \\"hard in texture and impervious to water,\\" from Washington State. Characterized in a 1933 Oregonian article as \\"looming, immense, and impressive,\\" the Courthouse retains its original character. Designed in the Renaissance Revival style, the building is a study in formalism with touches of Art Deco details. The symmetrical facade is accented with classically inspired details such as the Doric pilasters and the evenly spaced fenestration pattern. Prominent Renaissance Revival details include the rusticated entry level, multi-pane steel casement windows, and the belt course that separates the first level of the building from upper stories. A sandstone frieze with alternating classical triglyphs (groups of three vertical bands) and metopes (interstitial spaces) with Art Deco stylized floral patterns wraps the building. Topping the frieze is an egg-and-dart pattern beneath a moulded cornice. The flat roof features a parapet wall surmounted with scrolled cheneaux (ornamental gutters). Bronze details are used throughout the Courthouse, most notably on doors, decorative grilles, flagpole bases, and handrails. Principal entrance is gained through the central doorways on the Main Street facade. A repeating star-in-circle motif surrounds the doors, and a garland pattern stretches across the lintel. Surmounting the center door is an Art Deco-inspired eagle with outstretched wings. A modern white marble figurative sculpture by artist Manuel Neri is located east of the main entrance. Interior public spaces are richly appointed with lavish use of various types of marble. The floor of the foyer is of Brown Nebo Golden Travis marble, veined with natural gold. Surrounding trim is of Pink Kasota Fleuri and Red Nebo Golden Travis marbles. Handsome bas-relief figures memorializing Oregonians who fell in military service in World War I decorate the end walls. The foyer is topped by a plaster cornice and ceiling. Other impressive interior spaces are the two U.S. District Courts on the sixth story. Brown Nebo Travis Gold marble was used for trim and clock faces. Main doors are covered in leather; walls, cornices, and desks are oak. The decorative coffered ceiling, rosettes, and wall panels are plaster. Nearly full-height windows with oak shutters are located on the exterior walls. Ornate bronze heating grilles, Corinthian columns and pilasters, and glass and bronze lamps are suitably dignified details for the courtrooms. The post office, which occupied the basement and first floor of the site, moved to other quarters temporarily in 1984. It then closed on January 25, 2011. The original post office spaces were then renovated for use by the U.S. District Court. Today, the building retains its original character and many original materials and features. The Gus J.

Solomon Federal Building and United States Courthouse, commonly referred to as the Solomon Building is a historic post office and courthouse located at Chattanooga, Tennessee in Hamilton County, Tennessee. The courthouse serves the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as U.S. Post Office. It was designed by Shreve, Lamb and Harmon and Reuben Harrison Hunt with watercolor murals by Hilton Leech. Building history The Joel W. Solomon Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse was constructed in 1932‚Äì1933 as the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse. Designed jointly by Shreve, Lamb and Harmon and Reuben Harrison Hunt (1862‚Äì1937), it was Hunt's last major work, coming at the end of a career that spanned more than five decades. Hunt designed every major public building constructed in Chattanooga between 1895 and 1935. He was also the architect of local churches, hospitals, and private office buildings, as well as similar public and private buildings throughout the South. Chattanooga's Post Office and Courthouse was built as part of an expanded federal construction program, undertaken in the 1930s under the direction of Supervising Architect Louis A. Simon. This program resulted in the construction of new post offices and courthouses throughout the United States and provided employment to many architects, engineers, artists, and construction workers. The Post Office and Courthouse cost approximately $493,000. In 1938 the building was recognized by the American Institute of Architects as one of the 150 finest buildings constructed in the previous twenty years in the United States, and it was featured in an AIA photographic exhibit in America and Europe. Prominent U.S. District Court cases have been heard in the building. In 1960 the filing of a major civil rights lawsuit, Mapp et al. vs. the City of Chattanooga Board of Education, initiated the desegregation of the city's public schools. It was also the site of Jimmy Hoffa's 1964 conviction for jury tampering. The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, as part of a thematic nomination of the most significant buildings of Reuben Harrison Hunt. The General Services Administration assumed ownership of the building in 1981 and renamed it in honor of Joel \\"Jay\\" W. Solomon, a Chattanooga native and Administrator of GSA from 1977 to 1979. The main Chattanooga Post Office has relocated, but the building still houses federal courts and offices. Architecture The Joel W. Solomon Federal Building and U.S. Court-house stands in the central business district of Chattanooga. Facing Georgia Avenue and across from Miller Park, it occupies half a city block. The building is a notable example of the Art Moderne style as employed for government buildings in the 1930s. The form and details recall the classicism of earlier government architecture but take a stylized form here seen in sleek lines, a vertical emphasis, and plant, animal, and geometric decorative motifs. Several of the motifs, such as eagles and stars, evoke patriotic associations that are particularly appropriate for a federal building. The five-story building has a steel structure clad in white marble. Two penthouses are set on projecting towers at the northwest and southwest corners. On the west (main) elevation, end pavilions project from the towers. These flank a 13-bay central section with 13 three-story windows groups, recessed behind marble pilasters with fluted inner panels. A banded beltcourse running between the fourth floor and the parapet features a pattern of stars and eagles carved in low relief. The building's main entrances are set in the end pavilions. These are approached by wide steps of granite, with tiered cheek walls. Both upper cheek walls have stylized eagles carved into their corners. In each pavilion the paired and single entrance doors are surmounted by a curving window bay that rises four stories. Both are flanked by angled reveals, adorned with alternating fluted segments and foliate-motif plaques. The rear of the building is dominated by a five-story central section, flanked by one-story pavilions built to house the post office work floors. Carved panels above the window bays feature stylized eagles and shields. The building has elegant interior features and finishes consistent with the Art Moderne style while incorporating motifs suitable for a federal building. The entrance foyers and the lobby have their original chandeliers and marble walls and inlaid marble floors in chevron and star patterns. The lobby ceiling is bordered with bands set with stars. The entry foyer ceilings take the form of shallow domes set with a stylized star pattern. The lobby contains the original postal sales windows with ornate aluminum grilles and fittings, as well as original postal counters. Dark-veined marble staircases with ornate metal railings lead to the upper stories from the entrance foyers. \\"The Mail Carrier,\\" a cast-aluminum sculpture by Leopold Scholz, was installed in the postal lobby in 1938. The ceremonial courtroom is located on the third story. The courtroom lobby has marble walls and a terrazzo floor with an inlaid seal of justice. The courtroom is paneled in oak enhanced by decorative aluminum grilles. The judge's bench is a masterpiece of cabinetry. A mural called \\"Allegory in Chattanooga\\" curves behind the judge's bench. Installed in 1937, it was painted by Hilton Leech under the auspices of the Treasury Department's Section of Painting and Sculpture. The mural illustrates the history of the city through the New Deal era and includes a transmission tower symbolizing the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), headquartered in Chattanooga from its inception in 1935.

Metzenbaum U.S. Courthouse is a historic courthouse and post office building located on Superior Avenue in downtown Cleveland, Cuyahoga County, Ohio. Its west side faces Public Square and its north side faces The Mall. It was formerly the Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse and also known as Old Federal Building and Post Office. Building history The Howard M. Metzenbaum U.S. Courthouse, also known as the Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse, is a monumental anchor to Cleveland's Civic Mall. Fronting the Mall and Public Square, it was the first building erected under Cleveland's 1903 Group Plan, which illustrates the urban planning ideals of the City Beautiful movement. New York Architect Arnold W. Brunner (1857‚Äì1925) designed this imposing building under the direction of Supervising Architect of the Treasury James Knox Taylor (1857‚Äì1929). It is one of 35 buildings constructed during Taylor's tenure (1883‚Äì1912) that were designed by independent architects commissioned by the U.S. Treasury Department under the Tarsney Act. The 1893 Act authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to use private architects, selected through competitions, to design Federal buildings. As a process, it manifested the growing demand for greater architectural standards for public buildings and opened the way for additional appropriations to maintain those standards. As the first building erected under the Group Plan, the federal building was the model for later structures. The Group Plan proposed that local and federal government buildings be placed around a grand Mall. Embraced from the late 19th century into the first decades of the 20th century, the City Beautiful movement had its beginnings with the monumental planning and predominately classical architectural style of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Celebrated architect Daniel Burnham, who was instrumental in promoting the nationwide adoption of City Beautiful Movement principles, served as a member of the design team that produced the Group Plan. Arnold W. Brunner, working as an independent architect, and John Merven Carr√®re, of the prominent New York firm of Carr√®re and Hastings, also served on the team. The Federal Building formed one half of the Mall's termination at Superior Avenue. Cleveland's Public Library (1925), forming the other half of this terminus, emulates the Federal Building in scale, mass, and general overall appearance. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. On May 27, 1998, the building was officially renamed in honor of U.S. Senator Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio. Architecture One of the decorative stone eagles at the building's roofline The Howard M. Metzenbaum U.S. Courthouse is one of Cleveland's great monumental public buildings, skillfully illustrating the strong, classical characteristics of Beaux-Arts architecture. The five-story, granite-faced building was constructed between 1903 and 1910. The building covers the entire city block bounded by Rockwell Avenue on the north, Superior Avenue on the south, East Third Street on the east, and Public Square on the west. Inspiration for the design of this Beaux Arts building came from the Place de la Concorde in Paris as well as the work of French architect and theorist Francois Blondel. The resulting design presents a rusticated first floor and Corinthian order columns and pilasters on each elevation. These massive columns and pilasters define the sequence of window bays on the second, third, and fourth stories. Rusticated stone-arched windows with carved keystones adorn the first story. The more ornate second-story windows are capped with classically inspired pediments and balustraded sills. The third- and fourth-story window openings have molded surrounds and bracketed sills. Screening the fifth floor is an expansive entablature capped by a balustraded parapet that rises nine feet. A low-hipped, standing-seam copper roof crowns the building with attic dormer windows facing the interior light court. The parapets are adorned with shields and carved stone eagles at the building's corners. The main entrance to the building is centered on the Superior Avenue facade. Granite steps lead to three rusticated stone arches once fitted with cast bronze doors and ornate bronze lanterns hang from cast bronze brackets. The original doors have been replaced. Flanking the primary entrance are two important sculptures executed by the famed sculptor Daniel Chester French (1850‚Äì1931). Jurisprudence is located on the Public Square corner, while Commerce sits at the corner of East Third Street and Superior Avenue. Jurisprudence is personified by a mother figure clasping her baby while a criminal crouches in chains. Commerce is depicted as a female figure holding a model ship in one hand while her other arm rests on a globe representing the opportunity for world trade. At her right is Electricity, symbolized by a female figure holding a magnet catching electrical sparks. Steam, located to her left, is represented by a male figure grasping a wheel. On the interior, the grand main lobby dominates the first floor as it runs east to west across the entire length of the building. The floors, walls, and vaulted ceiling of the lobby are surfaced with marble. Original chandeliers illuminate the space. The postal service windows are located along the lobby's north wall. Marble stairs wrap around three sides of the elevator shafts, located at the east and west ends of the public lobby. Cast-bronze, spread-wing eagles standing on globes appear over each pair of elevator doors. Corner offices in the upper floors are adorned with impressive murals depicting significant events in the history of Cleveland. Among the magnificent artworks are City of Cleveland Welcomes the Arts by Will Hicok Low (1853‚Äì1932), and the Battle of Lake Erie by Rufus Fairchild Zogbaum (1849‚Äì1925). Murals in the ceremonial courtrooms on the third floor are The Common Law by Henry Siddons Mowbray (1858‚Äì1928), and The Law by Edwin Howland Blashfield (1848‚Äì1936). A major renovation project to restore public spaces and modernize the mechanical systems was initiated in 2002. Although the primary activities of the U.S. District Court system have moved to the new Carl B. Stokes Federal Court House Building a few blocks west, the ceremonial courtrooms in the Metzenbaum Courthouse will continue to be used for public hearings and proceedings. New client agencies moving into the renovated building will include the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the Office of the U.S. Trustee, and the U.S. Marshals Service.

In May 2000, Rifai was awarded the American Psychiatric Institute for Research and Education's Janssen Scholars Fellowship for research on severe mental illness. In 2006, he became the recipient of the Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine's William Webb Fellowship. As of 2007, he is a fellow of the Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine. He is also a fellow of the American College of Physicians and the American Psychiatric Association. He is a clinical professor of Medicine and Psychiatry at Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine and the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. Training and career He obtained his M.D. with honors from University of Aleppo Faculty of Medicine in 1996 and received a Neuroscience National Research Service Award funded by the National Institute of Mental Health. Rifai completed a neuroscience research training fellowship at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, College of Medicine in Memphis (1996‚Äì1998).

Medical research Rifai demonstrated the first evidence indicating a significant association between hepatitis C and psychiatric disorders (psychotic, affective, anxiety and substance use). The United States Department of Veterans Affairs commissioned a larger study to replicate these findings and confirmed the significant association between hepatitis C and psychiatric disorders. Rifai advocates for screening patients with psychiatric disorders for hepatitis C. In the mid 2000s, Rifai was involved in several studies on interferon-alpha (IFN-Œ±) induced depression in hepatitis C patients and possible use of Paroxetine and other antidepressants for its treatment. He and his colleagues only recommend the use of IFN-Œ± to eradicate hepatitis C along with \\"a comprehensive pretreatment assessment, a risk-benefit analysis, and intensive ongoing medical and psychiatric follow-up.\\" Rifai has coauthored a study on the proper intervention of agitated patients with goal of deescalating situations without the use of restraints or involuntary medication. He sometimes serves as a consultant to media, clinical, and judicial entities on a variety of topics related to behavioural sciences. Speaking to The New York Times about diseases including hepatitis C, he posited that the shame associated with diagnosis was also a major negative factor in treatment.

Biography Early years Chartier was born on December 30, 1966, in Glendale, California, at what is now Glendale Adventist Medical Center, to physician Stanley E. Chartier and Helen L. Bloodworth Chartier, later a realtor. His parents were socially conservative Seventh-day Adventists; his physician father had previously worked as an accountant and had taught the subject at local colleges.Gary Chartier, \\"Getting from There to Here,\\" LiberaLaw (np, Aug. 30, 2009). When Chartier was in high school he became interested in political theory after reading books by Robert Nozick, Murray Rothbard, Robert Anton Wilson, and Friedrich Hayek. He appeared as a guest on Wally George's Hot Seat television show in 1986 to defend an anarchist manifesto he submitted to the show's producers. College and graduate school Chartier received a bachelor's degree at what is now La Sierra University in 1987; he graduated magna cum laude and received the University President's Award. Though he had majored in history and political science, his undergraduate study of philosophy and religion led to his enrollment in a doctoral program in the philosophy of religion and theology at what was then Claremont Graduate School. While at Claremont, where he studied under John Hick, he applied and was accepted into a PhD program in the Faculty of Divinity at the University of Cambridge, where his teachers included Nicholas Lash and Brian Hebblethwaite, and from which he was graduated in 1991. His dissertation, supervised by Hebblethwaite, focused on the idea of friendship; his examiners were Stephen R. L. Clark and Michael Banner. By this time, his political views had taken a conventionally social democratic turn. Law school and teacher faculty appointment After working as the editor of a newspaper in Temecula, California, and of a journal published by La Sierra University, and teaching courses in religion and philosophy at Loma Linda University and California Baptist University, Chartier enrolled at the UCLA School of Law. At UCLA, he studied with philosophers including Stephen R. Munzer, Seana Shiffrin, and Pamela Hieronymi, with the political theorist Stephen Gardbaum, with former California Supreme Court Justice Cruz Reynoso, and with constitutional law scholar Kenneth L. Karst; he graduated in 2001 as a member of the Order of the Coif and as the recipient of the Judge Jerry Pacht Memorial Award in Constitutional Law. He had served during law school as lecturer in business ethics at La Sierra; a full-time academic appointment began in September 2001. Following a 2005 stint as lecturer in law at Brunel University, Chartier was promoted to the rank of associate professor and tenured at La Sierra in 2008. He became associate dean of La Sierra's business school in 2009; he was promoted to the rank of professor in 2012. He was named La Sierra's first Distinguished Professor effective January 2016. University of Cambridge recognition In 2015, the University of Cambridge presented Chartier with an earned LLD in recognition of his work in legal theory.See Darla Tucker, \\"Business prof awarded Doctor of Law degree by University of Cambridge,\\" La Sierra University, Dec. 17, 2015. Professional and community involvement Chartier serves as a member of the editorial board of the Libertarian Papers,Libertarian Papers: editorial board as a member of the advisory board of and an article reviewer for the Journal of Philosophical Economics,Journal of Philosophical Economics; Advisory Board as a trustee and senior fellow of the Center for a Stateless Society,C4SS: Gary Chartier a contributor to Spectrum magazine,Spectrum: Contributors and treasurer (formerly chair and Western Region vice-chair) of the Riverside County Libertarian Party.RCLP: Officers He is a contributor to the Bleeding Heart Libertarians weblog; he has used the website to argue in favor of anarchy, and against having a criminal justice system.See Erik Kain, \\"Criminal Justice in a Stateless Society,\\" Forbes, Aug. 21, 2011; Posts by Gary Chartier at Bleeding Heart Libertarians; Also see: Bleeding-heart libertarianism. Personal life On March 3, 2008, Chartier married Elenor L. Webb, whom he had known since 2001.

He married Alicia Homer on December 3, 2019.Public records, Riverside County, California. Intellectual development Chartier had abandoned his earlier libertarian views by the time he entered graduate school. Despite his support for the anti-authoritarian New Left and the fact that his doctoral dissertation had called for radical political decentralization,Gary Chartier, \\"Toward a Theology and Ethics of Friendship\\" (PhD diss., U of Cambridge 1991) ch. 4. his earlier work in political theory was, perhaps somewhat inconsistently, statist.See, e.g., Gary Chartier, \\"Peoples or Persons? Revising Rawls on Global Justice,\\" Boston College International and Comparative Law Review 27.1 (Winter 2004): 1‚Äì97; \\"A Progressive Case for a Universal Transaction Tax,\\" Maine Law Review 58.1 (2006): 1‚Äì16; The Analogy of Love: Divine and Human Love at the Center of Christian Theology (Exeter: Imprint Academic 2007) 126-8. It assumed, without criticism, that remedying poverty and reducing subordination, especially in the workplace, required the activity of the state. By contrast, Chartier's current work in political theory is libertarian and anarchist in flavor. His return to his libertarian roots reflects the impact of his encounters with the thought of contemporary left-libertarians Kevin Carson, Roderick T. Long, and Charles Johnson, as well as a renewed appreciation for Stephen R. L. Clark's critique of state authority.See Stephen R. L. Clark, Civil Peace and Sacred Order, Limits and Renewals 1 (Oxford: Clarendon-OUP 1989); \\"Slaves and Citizens\\" and \\"Anarchists against the Revolution,\\" The Political Animal: Biology, Ethics, Politics (London: Routledge 1999). Carson's work, in particular, provided a model for Chartier's reconciliation of his leftist politics with opposition to the state, and helped him to frame a version of left-libertarian market anarchism informed by insights from a version of natural law theory. Moral, political, and legal philosophy General themes Chartier defends a variant of natural law thinking, which he has employed in discussions of anarchism, economic life,See Gary Chartier, Economic Justice and Natural Law (Cambridge: CUP 2009). This book is principally an exercise in applied ethics, in which differences from other natural law views are more described than defended; it nonetheless addresses some more fundamental theoretical issues. These include the differences between natural law views and others regarding the character of practical reason and the limits of the arguments offered by other natural law theorists regarding the authority of the state. and the moral status and claims of non- human animals, as well as such other topics as sexuality\\"Natural Law, Same-Sex Marriage, and the Politics of Virtue,\\" UCLA Law Review 48.6 (Aug. 2001): 1593‚Äì1632. and lying.See \\"Toward a Consistent Natural Law Ethics of False Assertion,\\" American Journal of Jurisprudence 51 (2006): 43‚Äì64; \\"Self- Integration as a Basic Good: A Response to Chris Tollefsen,\\" American Journal of Jurisprudence 52 (2007: 293‚Äì6) Property and economic life Chartier offers an understanding of property rights as contingent but tightly constrained social strategies‚Äîreflective of the importance of multiple, overlapping rationales for separate ownership and of natural law principles of practical reasonableness, defending robust but non-absolute protections for these rights in a manner similar to that employed by David Hume.See Gary Chartier, Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society (New York: Cambridge UP 2013) 44-156. This account is distinguished both from Lockean and neo-Lockean views which deduce property rights from the idea of self-ownership and from consequentialist accounts that might license widespread ad hoc interference with the possessions of groups and individuals.See Gary Chartier, \\"Natural Law and Non-Aggression,\\" Acta Juridica Hungarica 51.2 (June 2010): 79‚Äì96 and, for an earlier version, Justice 32‚Äì46. Chartier uses this account to ground a clear statement of the natural law basis for the view that solidaristic wealth redistribution by individual persons is often morally required, but as a response by individuals and grass- roots networks to particular circumstances rather than as a state-driven attempt to achieve a particular distributive pattern.See Justice 47‚Äì68. He advances detailed arguments for workplace democracy rooted in such natural law principles as subsidiarity,Justice 89‚Äì120. defending it as morally desirable and as a likely outcome of the elimination of injustice rather than as something to be mandated by the state.See Gary Chartier, \\"Pirate Constitutions and Workplace Democracy,\\" Jahrbuch f√ºr Recht und Ethik 18 (2010): 449‚Äì67. He discusses natural law approaches to land reform and to the occupation of factories by workers.Justice 123-54. He objects on natural-law grounds to intellectual property protections, drawing on his theory of property rights more generally.See Gary Chartier,' \\"Intellectual Property and Natural Law,\\" Australian Journal of Legal Philosophy 36 (2011): 58‚Äì88. And he develops a general natural law account of boycotts.See Justice 176-82. Anarchism Chartier identifies himself as a \\"left-wing market anarchist.\\"Chartier offers this self-description in his Blogger profile. His approach to market anarchism reflects his indebtedness to Kevin Carson's mutualism, the new classical natural law theory elaborated by Germain Grisez and John Finnis, and the anarcho-conservatism of Stephen R. L. Clark. Chartier argues for anarchism on the basis that the state is unnecessary, illegitimate, and dangerous, and that the elimination of the state will unleash human creativity.See Chartier, Anarchy 157-241; Gary Chartier, The Conscience of an Anarchist: Why It's Time to Say Good-Bye to the State and Build a Free Society (Apple Valley, CA: Cobden 2011). His affinity for anarchism differentiates him from other proponents of natural-law ethics. Natural law theorists from St. Thomas Aquinas to the present have frequently been statists. They have often rejected consent-based theories of state authority as unrealistic, arguing instead, in a manner similar to David Hume's, that actually existing states deserve allegiance because of their capacity to preserve order. Chartier contends that the state is not needed to maintain social order, and that natural law theorists need not be attached to it in preference to other means of maintaining order, including custom, convention, and various voluntary arrangements.Justice 26-9. He has also linked his concerns with anarchism and natural law theory indirectly by defending anarchism against objections levelled by natural law theorist Mark C. Murphy. Murphy has maintained that all arguments for \\"philosophical anarchism\\" fail because they misconstrue the nature of many people's support for the authority of state-made law and that people who believe in the authority of state-made law are entitled to retain their beliefs in the face of anarchist criticism. Chartier argues in response that for many people, at least, belief in state authority is defeasible and can rightly be undermined by positive arguments against particular justifications for the authority of state-made law.\\"In Defence of the Anarchist,\\" Oxford Journal of Legal Studies 29.1 (2009): 115‚Äì38. Also important to his defense of anarchism is his detailed justification for the conclusion that, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, the institutions of a consensual, polycentric legal order can enforce the law without becoming morally indistinguishable from states.Gary Chartier, \\"Enforcing the Law and Being a State,\\" Law and Philosophy 31.1 (2012): 99‚Äì123. Even in Economic Justice and Natural Law, which is not concerned particularly with anarchism, he explicitly challenges the necessity of the state, and his discussion of law in a natural law context focuses on \\"communal norms, rules, and institutions\\"‚Äîwhich need not be maintained using force and which are intended to be understood as elements of a polycentric legal order‚Äîrather than on state-made laws.Chartier clearly intends Economic Justice and Natural Law to be read as an anarchist text; see Gary Chartier, \\"An Anarchist Text?\\" For the brief challenge to state authority in the book, see Justice 26-9. Chartier's Thomist view that multiple possible property systems might (within tight constraints) be just allows for a broader range of property rules than, e.g., many modern Lockeans might find appropriate; see, e.g., Justice 32‚Äì46, 69‚Äì122. Chartier has also taken a stance against military adventurism, warrantless surveillance, and waterboarding. \\"Capitalism\\" and \\"freed markets\\" Chartier has been an active participant in discussions among market anarchists and others about the aptness of \\"capitalism\\" as a label for what some participants in the conversation have termed \\"freed markets\\" in order to distinguish them from existing economic arrangements, which they see as shot through with statist privilege.For this phrase, see William Gillis, (The Freed Market). He has argued that proponents of genuinely freed markets should explicitly reject capitalism and identify with the global anti-capitalist movement, while emphasizing that the abuses the anti-capitalist movement highlights result from state-tolerated violence and state-secured privilege rather than from voluntary cooperation and exchange. According to Chartier, \\"it makes sense for [left-libertarians] to name what [it is] they oppose [in] 'capitalism.' [And by d]oing so . . . ensure[] that advocates of freedom aren't confused with people who use market rhetoric to prop up an unjust status quo, and[, therefore,] express[] solidarity between defenders of freed markets and workers‚Äî as well as [with] ordinary people around the world who use 'capitalism' as a short-hand label for the world-system that constrains their freedom and stunts their lives.\\"Sheldon Richman, \\"Libertarian Left: Free-Market Anti-Capitalism, the Unknown Ideal ,\\" The American Conservative 10.3 (March 2011): 28-32. He has joined Kevin Carson, Charles Johnson, and others (echoing the language of Benjamin Tucker and Thomas Hodgskin) in maintaining that, because of its heritage and its emancipatory goals and potential, radical market anarchism should be seen‚Äîby its proponents and by others‚Äîas part of the socialist tradition, and that market anarchists can and should call themselves \\"socialists.\\"See Gary Chartier, \\"Advocates of Freed Markets Should Oppose Capitalism,\\" \\"Free-Market Anti-Capitalism?\\" session, annual conference, Association of Private Enterprise Education (C√¶sar's Palace, Las Vegas, NV, April 13, 2010); Gary Chartier, \\"Advocates of Freed Markets Should Embrace 'Anti-Capitalism'\\"; Gary Chartier, Socialist Ends, Market Means: Five Essays. Cp. Tucker, \\"Socialism.\\" Non-human animals While supporting vegetarianism and affirming that non-human animals have moral standing,See, e.g., Gary Chartier, \\"Natural Law and Animal Rights,\\" Canadian Journal of Law and Jurisprudence 23.1 (2010): 33‚Äì46. Chartier follows Stephen R. L. Clark in rejecting consequentialist defenses of vegetarianism like those offered by Peter Singer.See the discussion of consequentialism and meat purchases in Gary Chartier, \\"Consumers, Boycotts, and Non-Human Animals,\\" Buffalo Environmental Law Journal 12 (Spring 2005): 123‚Äì94. Singer's own position is articulated in Peter Singer, Animal Liberation: A New Ethics for Our Treatment of Animals, 2d ed. (London: Cape 1990); Peter Singer, Practical Ethics, 2d ed. (Cambridge: CUP 1993) 55‚Äì63. For Clark's rejection of consequentialist arguments for the vegetarian position he himself endorses, see Stephen R. L. Clark, The Moral Status of Animals, 2d ed. (Oxford: Clarendon-OUP 1984) x‚Äìxi; Stephen R. L. Clark, \\"Vegetarianism and the Ethics of Virtue,\\" Food for Thought: The Debate over Eating Meat, ed. Stephen F. Sapontzis (Buffalo, NY: Prometheus 2004) 139, 146; Stephen R. L. Clark, Animals and Their Moral Standing (London: Routledge 1998) 100. Singer acknowledges that, on consequentialist grounds, it might seem as if there is little reason for individuals to be concerned about their dietary choices, since few of those choices will actually have consequences for any actual animals. But Singer maintains that some few dietary choices will, by crossing certain demand thresholds, dramatically increase production of animals for food and that taking this possibility into account provides good reason to avoid purchasing meat, since there is a small chance that a single meat purchase might lead to substantial negative consequences for many animals.Peter Singer, \\"Utilitarianism and Vegetarianism,\\" Philosophy and Public Affairs 9 (1980): 335. Chartier dissects Singer's argument, maintaining that it is unsuccessful because it fails to take proper account of the actual characteristics of the meat production market (or any similarly enormous market). He examines in detail consequentialist, natural law, and virtue theoretic accounts of boycotting the meat industry, concluding that both natural law and virtue theory provide limited grounds on which a boycott might be defended, but that consequentialism does not. While he maintains, in tandem with the new classical natural law theorists, that consequentialism is in principle incoherent, he also challenges the factual predictions made by consequentialist proponents of the meat industry boycott.See Gary Chartier, \\"On the Threshold Argument against Consumer Meat Purchases,\\" Journal of Social Philosophy 37.2 (Sum. 2006): 235‚Äì51. Philosophy of religion and philosophical theology General topics Chartier's work in the philosophy of religion and philosophical theology has focused especially on theodicy and divine action, but he has also addressed a range of other topics, including the significance of talk about God as personal, Christology, the relationship between God and ethics, and the idea of substitutionary atonement. The meaning of God-language Chartier has offered a reading of language about God as personal that partly parallels logical behaviorist interpretations of talk about consciousness. He suggests that, because we cannot pretend to know what God is like in se, this sort of reading, while inappropriate when applied to finite persons, could be helpful when used in relation to God.Analogy 52-5. Divine action and theodicy He suggests that talk about divine action provides a necessary starting point for theological reflection, and argues that the only reasonable way to think about divine action, in turn, is to begin by considering the constraints on credible talk about divine providence imposed by the reality of suffering and evil.For the latter point, see Analogy 39. Reviewing a range of options in theodicy, he concludes that, while their underlying assumptions (and accounts of creation) are different, classical free will theism and process theology lead to very similar predictions regarding what kinds of divine action are to be expected, and that, in connection with the task of constructive theology, there is therefore no need to choose between them,Analogy 39‚Äì49. though the differences continue to matter with respect to questions in the philosophy of religion and philosophical theology. When he does directly address questions related to theodicy, he implies that process philosophy offers a more satisfactory theodicy than any alternative approach to theism, but he argues that even the process approach has significant difficulty taking proper account of the reality of animal suffering.\\"Non-Human Animals and Process Theodicy,\\" Religious Studies 42.1 (2006): 3‚Äì26. He maintains that Christian attempts to use the Incarnation as a component of theodicy are rendered problematic by the need to articulate belief in incarnational Christology using a robust account of divine action, which seems likely itself to make it harder to resolve the problem of evil (if God is in the business of working miracles, as such a robust view implies, why aren't there more of them?).See \\"The Incarnation and the Problem of Evil,\\" Heythrop Journal 49 (2008): 110‚Äì27. Theism and ethics Chartier argues that divine command views of ethics turn out to be inconsistent with talk about God's love for the world. Talk about love in this context is meaningful only if some intelligible sense can be given to the notion of the beloved's well being that is independent of the choice of the lover, so the theist cannot maintain that God is love without acknowledging that some objective sense can be given to the notion of creaturely flourishing apart from God's will. The range of reasonable moral principles is constrained by facts about flourishing, and basic moral norms seem credible independently of the divine volition. And imposing obligations over and above those following from these principles would itself be an unloving thing to do.Analogy 112-21. Atonement Criticizing substitutionary accounts of atonement, Chartier notes that such theories purport to be committed to belief in retributive justice, and thus fall victim to standard objections to retributivism. At the same time, however, by allowing for substituted punishment, they imply a view of justice unlikely to be satisfactory to retributivists themselves.Analogy 213-6. Publications Chartier is the author of eight scholarly books‚ÄîAn Ecological Theory of Free Expression, The Logic of Commitment, Public Practice, Private Law, Anarchy and Legal Order, Radicalizing Rawls, Economic Justice and Natural Law, The Analogy of Love, and The Conscience of an Anarchist‚Äîand of articles in journals including the Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, Law and Philosophy, Legal Theory, the UCLA Law Review, and Religious Studies, the co-editor (with Charles Johnson) of Markets Not Capitalism and (with David M. Hart, Roderick T. Long, and Ross Kenyon) of Social Class and State Power, and the editor of The Future of Adventism. Reactions to publications David Gordon praised Radicalizing Rawls: \\"Chartier has written a book of outstanding merit. Radicalizing Rawls confirms his place as one of the best political philosophers of our time.\\"David Gordon, \\"John Rawls and Market Anarchy,\\" Mises Review (Ludwig von Mises Institute, March 9, 2014). Reactions to Anarchy and Legal Order have been mixed, though frequently positive. Reviewing the book in Common Knowledge, Peter Leeson described it as \\"intriguing\\" and classed it \\"among the most sophisticated ethical defenses of anarchy I have encountered.\\"Peter T. Leeson, rev. of Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society, by Gary Chartier, Common Knowledge 20.3 (2014): 505. In Anarchist Studies, Eric Roark wrote: \\"Gary Chartier's Anarchy and Legal Order offers nothing less than a tremendous contribution to contemporary libertarian and anarchist thought.\\" Roark highlighted what he characterized as a \\"compelling and rich vision of anarchy forged by a just legal regime.\\"Eric Roark, rev. of Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society, by Gary Chartier, Anarchist Studies 21.2 (2013): 106-7. Edward Stringham characterized the book as \\"well written, thought provoking, and a welcome addition to the literature.\\"Edward P. Stringham, rev. of Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society, by Gary Chartier, Public Choice 159.3-4 (2014): 583. Aeon Skoble of Bridgewater State University suggested in a Reason review that Chartier's \\"arguments [in the book] are laid out with such elegance and precision that any intelligent lay reader should be able to understand them.\\" Skoble writes: \\"Anarchy and Legal Order is an impressive contribution to libertarian thought generally, and in particular to the ongoing debates on anarchism versus minarchism and on libertarianism's place vis-a-vis the left/right dichotomy. It's a must-read for those interested in political philosophy, and it may well challenge readers' long-held beliefs about the nature of government.\\"Aeon J. Skoble, \\"Is Anarchism Socialist or Capitalist?,\\" rev. of Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society, by Gary Chartier, Reason (Reason Foundation, April 2013). In a symposium in Studies in Emergent Order devoted to the book, Skoble added: \\"Chartier's argument demonstrates not only that natural law theory is compatible with spontaneous order theory, but also that what this confluence points to is a voluntary, polycentric legal order. The book is thus valuable not only for offering a robust defense of polycentrism, but for doing so in a way that ties together two important threads from the liberal tradition, natural law and spontaneous order, and in doing so, enhances our understanding of both.\\"Aeon J. Skoble, \\"Natural Law and Spontaneous Order in the Work of Gary Chartier ,\\" Studies in Emergent Order 7 (2014): 311-12. Also writing in the symposium, Jason Brennan criticized Chartier's reliance on the controversial new natural law theory and objected to his embrace of the theory's view that basic aspects of well being are incommensurable, a view Brennan suggested led to counterintuitive, implausible conclusions.Jason Brennan, \\"Controversial Ethics as a Foundation for Controversial Political Theory ,\\" Studies in Emergent Order 7 (2014): 299-306; cp. Jason Brennan, rev. of Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society, by Gary Chartier, Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews (U of Notre Dame, March 10, 2013). While expressing some concerns about the feasibility of Chartier's proposals, Paul Dragos Aligica concluded: \\"Anarchy and Legal Order is currently the book to read if one wants to explore the potential and limits of natural law, non- aggression maxim, praxeology based doctrines of stateless social order. Austrian scholars of all persuasions will benefit immensely from engaging with its arguments and the intellectual precedent it creates.\\"Paul Dragos Aligica, rev. of Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society, by Gary Chartier, Review of Austrian Economics 26.2 (June 2013): 41. Jonathan Crowe called Economic Justice and Natural Law \\"important and original.\\" Timothy Chappell declared that it was \\"[e]ssential reading\\" and maintained that it was \\"elegant, clear, and well-informed.\\" According to Stephen Munzer, it was \\"perceptive, timely, and beautifully ordered\\" and featured arguments that were \\"probing and trenchant.\\"Economic Justice and Natural Law cover blurbs. By contrast, St. John's University economist Charles Clarke criticized the book's anarchism, evaluating it as insufficiently attentive to the need for governmental involvement in the economy and as unduly similar in tone to the work of Austrian economists.See Charles Clark, rev. of Economic Justice and Natural Law, by Gary Chartier, Conversations in Religion and Theology 9.2 (Nov. 2011): 179-87. The book was the focus of a Molinari Society session at the April 2011 San Diego convention of the American Philosophical Association's Pacific Division.The session was chaired by Roderick T. Long. The commentators were David Gordon, Douglas Rasmussen, Douglas Den Uyl, Jennifer Baker, and Kevin Carson. For details, see the Molinari Society's description of the program here. The Analogy of Love received mixed reviews. In the course of a tepidly favorable assessment, Timothy Gorringe maintained that some passages disposed him to \\"reach for the whiskey bottle,\\" though he also observed that the book did \\"not parade its erudition\\" and suggested that it was \\"consistently on the side of the angels.\\"Timothy Gorringe, rev. of The Analogy of Love, by Gary Chartier, Theology, Sep.-Oct 2008: 384‚Äì5. By contrast, Ian Markham characterized the book as \\"a rare treat,\\" labelling it \\"[c]ompelling, well-argued, crystal clear and deeply creative\\" and identifying it as \\"[a]n absolute must-read.\\"Analogy of Love cover blurb. Paul Ballard described Analogy as \\"extremely well informed and researched,\\" as \\"comprehensive,\\" and as \\"rich, sensitive and insightful.\\" Ballard evaluated the book's \\"style of presentation\\" as \\"remarkably lucid and jargon free\\" and as \\"spare, simple, direct and logical, cutting to the heart of a discussion.\\" See Paul Ballard, rev. of The Analogy of Love, by Gary Chartier, Theological Book Review 20.1 (2008): 54‚Äì5. Stephan Kinsella has described Chartier's third book as \\"the best of the crop of political 'conscience' books.\\"Kinsella's comments appear as a jacket endorsement on the back cover of the book. For an earlier version, see Stephan Kinsella, \\"Chartier's Conscience of an Anarchist.\\" The title is a reference to such earlier works as Barry Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative, Paul Krugman's The Conscience of a Liberal, Zell Miller's A National Party No More: The Conscience of a Conservative Democrat, and Wayne Allyn Root's The Conscience of a Libertarian. Jeff Riggenbach maintains that \\"[l]ibertarians who are now in their teens and twenties could do far worse than to let their own attention be captured by Gary Chartier's Conscience of an Anarchist.\\"Jeff Riggenbach, \\"The Anarchist Conscience,\\" Mises Daily (Ludwig von Mises Institute, June 10, 2011). According to Aeon Skoble, \\"Chartier's arguments are logically well structured and rhetorically effective. His writing style is clear and straightforward.\\" Skoble emphasizes that \\"[p]eople with a background in philosophy or economics will find the arguments interesting and not simplistic, yet any intelligent lay reader will find the book accessible.\\"Aeon J. Skoble, rev. of The Conscience of an Anarchist, by Gary Chartier, Independent Review 3.16 (Winter 2012): 472. Skoble says the book features \\"five chapters of convincing argument that the state causes terrible problems for no justifiable reason.\\"Skoble 474.

Pastore Federal Building The John O. Pastore Federal Building is a courthouse of the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island located in Providence, Rhode Island. Building history Post offices in cities such as Providence initially occupied rented quarters in commercial buildings. As the United States became more populous and prosperous, designs for post office buildings were developed. Providence's first federal building and custom house, built in the Italianate style, was constructed 1855-1857. As the city grew, the need for more space became apparent. In 1908, a new courthouse, post office, and custom house building in the Beaux Arts style was erected at the northeast end of Exchange Place Mall (now Kennedy Plaza). Both of these buildings remain on their original sites and are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. By the late 1920s, the need for additional space again became urgent. The city selected a site adjacent to the 1908 Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse. A local architectural firm, Jackson, Robertson & Adams, received the commission to design an annex to the Beaux Arts building. This firm also had designed the Providence County Courthouse, an addition to City Hall, the State Office Building, and the Rhode Island State Airport Terminal at Hillsgrove. Cornerstone laying ceremonies took place in September 1939. The post office annex, as it was then called, was completed by May 1940 at a cost of $896,000. The U.S. General Services Administration acquired the building in 1961. Renamed in 1977 for former Governor and U.S. Senator John O. Pastore, the building was listed in the National Register in 1984 as a contributing building to the Downtown Providence Historic District, and individually in 2017. Architecture Aerial view of the John O. Pastore Federal Building A product of the New Deal- era Works Progress Administration (WPA), the three-story Pastore Federal Building is an example of Stripped Classical architectural style, with Art Deco elements. The Stripped Classical style features classical design tenets, such as symmetry and historical references in ornamentation, but is simple in its execution. Art Deco is noted for low-relief geometrical designs, accents in terra cotta and glass, and exterior wall coverings such as concrete, smooth-faced stone, and metal. The building's exterior materials are red brick and limestone, with a granite base. A two-story, five-bay limestone frontispiece graces the east facade. A granite balustrade extends between the two entries, while a concrete and granite ramp was added to the south entrance in 1983. Streamlined pilasters are centered between the bays of windows and doors. A simple cornice with square dentils extends along the top of the frontispiece, and is echoed by a streamlined band of limestone along the roof's edge. Bronze-clad double doors are at each entrance. Projecting, gabled brick pavilions are located at either end of the facade. Each has centered windows framed with a limestone surround. Cast concrete sculptures on the facade were created by artist Raymond Barger, a Maryland native who studied at the Carnegie Institute and Yale. Completed in 1940, the carved sculptures were executed under the WPA's federal art program. The sculptures above the two main entrances depict stylized eagles. On the projecting pavilions, the sculptures consist of the head and torso of human figures, a sun or moon and stars, and illustrations of different means of delivering mail. A \\"Contact Room\\" on the west (rear) side connected the second-floor postal workroom to railroad tracks along the Woonasquatucket River. Metal-clad columns set in the river support the room. The sides and rear of the building feature a simplified design treatment, with a granite base, limestone string course between the second and third stories, and a limestone roof band. The windows are accented by decorative sills and plain stone lintels. Above the rear entrances, granite cladding surrounds the second-story windows. Lobby Inside, the first floor is divided into the postal lobbies and the large Postal Workroom, which encompasses approximately 90 percent of the floor area. The public spaces feature rose marble flooring and Tennessee Tarvernelle marble wainscoting. Elevator doors are sheathed in bronze and brass, and bronze trim frames the letter slots and service windows. An open screen of Greek key fretwork is above the service windows. Bulletin boards with bronze frames are alongside two classically detailed bronze writing tables, and a round writing table of similar design is near the service windows. Historic bronze light fixtures with octagonal frosted-glass pendants and eagle decorations adorn the lobby. In 1971-1972, the building's first major renovation was completed at a cost of approximately $1 million. The Alrae Construction Company of Providence performed the renovation work. The project's main component involved conversion of the second-story workroom into office space for federal agencies. Most of the second floor's interior configuration and finishes date from this period. The third floor has always housed a variety of offices, including that of U.S. Senator John O. Pastore, for whom the building was named. In the third-floor corridor, terrazzo flooring, marble baseboards, and molded metal doors and trim comprise the decorative finishes. Wood windows with patterned glazing in the interior walls let light from the perimeter offices into the corridor.

It is a courthouse for the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. It is also the site for oral argument before the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, when that court sits in Puerto Rico. Building history The courthouse was designed to provide suitable accommodations for important government offices and to demonstrate the commitment of the United States to the Island of Puerto Rico. From the initial settlement of San Juan, this harbor side site has been critical to the city's defense and economic development. Initially, portions of the site contained a Spanish fortification, the Bastion de San Justo del Muelle, which was built in 1639 (shortly after the city was invaded by the Dutch) and remained in place until 1897. The southern portion of the site contained a building that was likely a Spanish custom house constructed during the 1830s. In 1898, the U.S. Government took possession of Puerto Rico and established a presence on the island. When the United States established a governance structure for Puerto Rico in 1900, the need for public buildings became apparent. The structure is composed of two distinct but connected buildings. The first building of the complex was designed between 1906 and 1908 by the Office of the Supervising Architect of the Department of the Treasury, led by James Knox Taylor. Constructed between 1911 and 1914, it was the island's first significant federal building. In 1936, an addition was proposed to accommodate New Deal programs created in response to the Great Depression. Congress authorized the expansion the same year, and plans were completed by the Department of the Treasury's Public Buildings Branch under Supervising Architect Louis A. Simon in 1938. Construction of the addition was completed in 1940. It is a substantial building that was designed independently of the earlier building, although the two are physically connected on the south facade of the 1914 building. In 1986 the building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In 1999 the building was renamed for Jose Victor Toledo. Toledo (1931‚Äì1980) served as a justice and chief judge in the U.S. District Court, District of Puerto Rico, from 1970 until his death a decade later. Architecture The three-story, 1914 section of the courthouse displays a sophisticated and harmonious blend of the Spanish Colonial Revival style with classically inspired forms and details that reflect both the indigenous architecture of Puerto Rico and the prevalent style used on federal government buildings of the era. View of original building, circa 1915 The U-shaped structure sits on a foundation of concrete piers and wood piles. Constructed on a site that slopes north to south toward the harbor, it consists of a partially excavated basement, two floors with loggias, and a set-back third floor capped with a Spanish-tile roof. left The raised basement is finished with rusticated granite, while the upper floors are constructed of brick and concrete and finished in stucco. The north elevation features a centrally placed, projecting, multi-curved parapet and flanking entry portals. The loggias, hallmarks of the Spanish Colonial Revival Style, provide ventilation and shelter from the weather. The openings are segmentally arched with projecting keystones topping the openings. Classically inspired pilasters divide the openings and are skillfully combined with wrought-iron balusters that are located on the second level. Windows are covered with wrought-iron grilles. The clay tile roof with wide overhanging eaves reflects indigenous architectural influence. Supported by paired brackets and set over the building's ornamental cornice, the eaves provide relief from the hot sun and protect the building from rain. The 1940 building connects with the earlier building on the south elevation. It covers the building's original grand terraced harbor side entrance and most of its main facade. The simple Streamline Moderne-Art Moderne tower is characteristic of much government architecture of the late 1930s. It contains minimal decorative detailing, but its massing contributes strongly to the building's visual prominence. Rectangular in plan and six stories in height, the 1940 building is constructed of cast-in-place, reinforced concrete. Two towers capped with handsome, four-ton, bronze lanterns, flank the building and extend above the six-story main edifice. Significant interior spaces of the Jose V. Toledo Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse include, in the 1914 building, a marble- trimmed entrance lobby with a Spanish-inspired white marble imperial staircase, and public corridors of salt-glazed brick with cast-iron ventilator grilles designed to keep the building comfortable in the tropical Puerto Rican climate. The 1940 addition includes a fifth-floor ceremonial courtroom with decorative tile wainscoting and a diamond-pattern cornice. Original 1940s furnishings have been recreated. In 1996 the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) commenced a meticulous restoration following the recovery of approximately 16,000 artifacts that were discovered during preliminary archaeological work on the site. The exterior was restored to its 1940 appearance. Historically significant areas were identified for restoration or replacement. The second-story loggia, closed in the late 1940s or early 1950s, was reopened. The six-foot eaves, removed in 1958, were reconstructed. Original ceremonial spaces were restored. The building was reinforced to withstand earthquakes. Wherever possible, original architectural materials were reused rather than replaced, preserving the integrity of the building. In March 2000 the Society for History in the Federal Government awarded the John Wesley Powell Prize for Excellence in Historic Preservation to GSA for the rehabilitation and restoration work conducted at the building. In 2002 the project received two awards: the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation Chairman's Award for outstanding federal preservation achievement, and the American Institute of Architects New England Charter's Honor Award. In 2009, GSA began remodeling of the postal spaces for the bankruptcy court support activities and judges chambers, using the architectural firm Perkins Eastman of Pittsburgh and the construction firm Fe-Ri Construction of San Juan.

Powell Jr. United States Courthouse, also known as the U.S. Post Office and Customhouse, is a historic custom house, post office and courthouse located in Richmond, Virginia. Originally constructed in 1858, it was for decades a courthouse for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. A new federal district courthouse opened in 2008, but the Powell Courthouse still houses the Fourth Circuit. The United States Congress renamed the building for Supreme Court justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., in 1993.H.R.1513 -- To designate the United States courthouse located at 10th and Main Streets in Richmond, Virginia, as the 'Lewis F. Powell Jr. United States Courthouse'. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as U.S. Post Office and Customhouse. Building history Courthouse Additions 1858-present Richmond Customhouse,1856 U. S. Customhouse, Richmond, VA 1900 U. S. Post Office and Courthouse 1912 Lewis F. Powell Jr. United States Courthouse, first floor Post Office lobby 1972 The courthouse is one of only two buildings in the historic core of Richmond to survive the devastating 1865 fire that marked the evacuation of the Confederate Army during the last days of the Civil War. It is the oldest courthouse in GSA's inventory. Constructed as the U.S. Custom House, Post Office and Courthouse, the original portion of the building was completed in 1858 to designs of Ammi B. Young, then Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury Department. The building received additions that were completed in 1889, 1912, and 1932, all three of which hewed closely to the imposing Italianate forms that characterized the original building. The building played a significant role in the American Civil War when the Congress of the new Confederate States of America selected Richmond as its capital. The courthouse provided offices for Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Following the conflict, the federal government reoccupied the building. Then, in 1866, the Grand Jury of the United States District Court met on the third floor and indicted Davis for treason. Davis returned to the courthouse in 1867 for a hearing, but was granted amnesty and never stood trial. Pressure to enlarge the courthouse began in the first decade of the 20th century, when the antitrust policies of President Theodore Roosevelt and associated legislation created an expansion of judicial oversight. In 1910, construction began on a massive expansion of the courthouse, which increased the size of the original building twelve-fold. Matching wings on the east and west were constructed between 1910 and 1932. An Art Deco Annex was constructed in 1935‚Äì36 adjacent to the courthouse. In 1993, by which time the building housed only judicial functions, President Bill Clinton dedicated the building as the Lewis F. Powell Jr. United States Courthouse in honor of the retired Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court Lewis F. Powell Jr., a native Virginian. Architecture Custom house following the Evacuation Fire of 1865. The building is an impressive example of the Italianate architecture that became popular in this country during the third quarter of the 19th century. Originally sited in the middle of the block between Tenth and Eleventh Streets, the two primary facades of the courthouse faced Main and Bank streets. Constructed between 1855 and 1858, the original block of the courthouse was designed by Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury Department Ammi B. Young. Five round arches formed an arcade marking the entrance on Main Street, and a heavy granite portico of three arches, reached by three granite steps, fronted the Bank Street entrance, which was set back from the property line. The three-story exterior of the courthouse was clad in ashlar granite on the first floor and ashlar limestone on the second and third floors. The remaining elements of the original construction can still be seen on the lower levels of the Bank and Main street facades, including the Main Street arcade and the Bank Street portico. The Courthouse exhibits an early use of iron as a structural material in a federal building. As noted in a letter from Secretary of the Treasury James Guthrie, the use of \\"wrought iron beams and girders\\" in federal building construction at that time was \\"wholly new.\\" The structural system employed groin vaults to support upper floors, with cast-iron columns supporting beams and girders. U.S. Custom House & Post Office, 1887-89 Main Street View The 1887‚Äì89 additions to the building, completed under the direction of Supervising Architect Mifflin E. Bell, consisted of one-by-one-bay wings attached to each of the building's corners, giving the courthouse an I-shaped plan. The Bank Street facade, including its portico, was moved forward to the property line, and a classical pediment added to the Main Street entrance. Federal courts expanded the range of their oversight at the beginning of the twentieth century, requiring an expansion of court facilities. The Richmond courthouse was enlarged in 1910‚Äì12 and 1930‚Äì32, expanding to fill the entire city block. Once again the designs emanated from the Office of the Supervising Architect under James Knox Taylor for the earlier addition, and under James A. Wetmore for the latter. The enlargement called for demolition of the courthouse interiors, the addition of a fourth floor and expansion to Tenth and Eleventh streets. While maintaining the general features of the original design, stylistic changes evolved in the additions: the cornice was extended along Bank and Main streets with restrained classical motifs to encompass the new wings, and the Italianate windows were replaced with windows featuring semicircular transoms. So precisely was the work carried out that today it is nearly impossible to distinguish between the four phases of construction. The courthouse was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. By 1991, the U.S. Postal Service had vacated the building and only judicial functions remained. The courts undertook a master plan for the renovation and preservation of some of the most significant spaces within the original building, hoping to restore the finishes to their 1858 appearance. The first phase of the work, which took place in 1996‚Äì99, included the restoration of a part of the Greek Revival Main Street Lobby and office space on the third floor.

Anthony Burgess. Thomas Dunne Books, 2004. Although the composer was German, the original libretto by James Robinson Planch√© is also in English, and included in the book. Complaints about Planch√©'s libretto have been common over the years, with Donald Tovey going so far as to call it a \\"pig-trough\\"; in performance it has usually been replaced with the German version by Theodor Hell. In August 2004, Scottish Opera staged several of Weber's operas, including Oberon (on 18 August), shortly before disbanding its chorus in order to meet budget cuts. However, Burgess's libretto was not used. One critic observed that: :Perhaps not surprisingly, Scottish Opera has not volunteered to revive its 1985 production of Oberon at Edinburgh. This version was commissioned from the novelist Anthony Burgess, who not only replaced the archaic expressions and ersatz Shakespeare of Planch√©'s original, but also updated the story to involve hijackers and hostages in a futuristic Middle East. A staging that parked an aeroplane on the roof of Glasgow's Theatre Royal on the opening night only seemed to sink the already preposterous plot further into the mire, although Burgess was so taken with the music that he went on to arrange the overture to Oberon for guitar quartet. A year later, Frank Dunlop, in the third of the Edinburgh Festivals he directed, created an imaginative semi-staging of the opera on a tilting disc erected on the platform of the Usher Hall.Lynne Walker. \\"Tales of suspense: Carl Weber's operas are rarely staged, but that hasn't deterred Scottish Opera from taking on the challenge.\\" The Independent.

Davies Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse is a historic post office and federal office building located at Grand Forks in Grand Forks County, North Dakota, United States. It is a courthouse for the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota. Also and historically known as U.S. Post Office and Courthouse, the building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places under that name. Building history The building was among the first monumental civic buildings in Grand Forks. Originally completed in 1906, the building was envisioned to be a majestic Post Office and Federal Courthouse at a time when Grand Forks was achieving increasing prominence in the agricultural hub of the Red River Valley. The city's existing post office, housed in an 1870s log cabin, had become obsolete and rising political and business influences demanded a more monumental and permanent post office and courthouse. The new Federal building was sited at the north corner of Fourth Street and First Avenue in the downtown business district. James Knox Taylor, Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury Department, was responsible for the building's Beaux-Arts Classical design. The building inspired similar architecture for the adjacent enclave of Classical Revival buildings, including City Hall and Central High School. In 1936, the demand for more space prompted the construction of a three-story addition to the rear of the building, designed by Louis A. Simon of the Supervising Architect's Office. The addition harmonized modern infrastructure with the original architecture by using like materials and details. The new configuration included passenger elevators and a light well to illuminate the first-floor work areas. In 1964, when the U.S. Postal Service moved out of the building and into a new, larger facility, interior renovations remodeled the first floor into offices, adding a new stair tower to the north side of the building. In 2001, the building was renamed after Federal District Judge Ronald N. Davies, pursuant to legislation sponsored by Senator Byron Dorgan,\\"Judge known for desegregation ruling honored\\", The Bismarck Tribune (August 6, 2001), p. 8. and signed into law by President Bill Clinton the previous year.\\"Federal building being renamed\\", The Bismarck Tribune (December 22, 2000), p. 24. Judge Davies served in the municipal courts in Grand Forks from 1932‚Äì40, and was appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower as the U.S. District Court Judge of North Dakota. Davies presided over the Stromsodt v. Parke-Davis and Company case in 1966, a case that involved a damage suit against one of the nation's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers, and, while on temporary assignment, \\"made a monumental decision to desegregate schools in Little Rock, Ark[ansas]\\" in 1957. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Architecture The Ronald N. Davies Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse reflects James Knox Taylor's mannered use of classicism to create an imposing architectural statement of the Federal Government's presence in Grand Forks. The building is a three-story, rectangular, masonry structure of yellow brick and limestone detailing that creates one of the most prominent displays of Beaux-Arts Classicism in the city. Federal Government architects embraced classicism during the early twentieth century as a method of symbolizing democratic ideals of government and power. The distinctive style is exemplified in the building's symmetry, central emphasis, and classical ornamentation. On the facade, the most elaborate decorative features are reserved for the centralized three-bay section. Like the secondary elevations, the facade is composed of three horizontal zones. A rusticated base of alternating bands of limestone and brick courses is differentiated from the smooth limestone walls of the upper stories, which form the middle zone. The upper stories are articulated fenestration framed by colossal Tuscan order pilasters. The third zone is defined by the entablature, including a blank frieze surmounted by a heavy dentil molding, projecting cornice, and balustraded parapet, composed of alternating balusters with raised panels. A large festooned cartouche at the parapet is a crowning feature of the central bay's vertical axis. Refined Beaux-Arts embellishments accentuate the facade's key features. The main entrance is prominently centered and framed by a segmental arch bedecked by a keystone and festooned swags, and banded pilasters, which support an \\"audience balcony\\" above. The interior public spaces are monumental in scale and classical in detail. The first-floor entry lobby, while reduced in size from its original configuration, retains its ceiling, featuring a cast-plaster cornice, moldings, soffits, and modillions. Marble adorns the walls and window sills. A central marble staircase with a richly ornamented cast-iron balustrade ascends from the first-floor lobby to the upper floors. The second- and third-floor finishes are generally unchanged from their original condition, consisting of white marble wainscoting and green marble base and trim. Second- and third-floor public corridors have coved ceilings with cast- plaster picture moldings at the spring line. The courtroom - with monumental proportions - represents a dignity apropos of its function as a Federal courthouse. Its coffered, ceiling features dentil molding, modillions, and plaster acanthus leaves and buds that grace each coffer's perimeter. The walls are divided by wood wainscoting surmounted by raised plaster panels with molding surrounds. Windows extend upwards from the wainscoting and are partially trimmed on three sides with cast-plaster acanthus leaves matching those on the ceiling. From its earliest period, the courtroom has been carefully preserved. When the judge's bench and jury boxes were relocated from the east to the west wall in 1936, the alterations to the wainscoting, plaster ceiling details, and the wall panels were painstakingly matched to existing 1906 finishes. Because few older buildings in the city's central business district have survived unmodified, the Ronald N. Davies Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse stands as an unusual example of a monumental structure essentially unaltered. As it has for the past century, the building today represents the Federal presence and stands as a visual focus and historic architectural antecedent in downtown Grand Forks.

The Strom Thurmond Federal Building and United States Courthouse is United States federal building located in Columbia, South Carolina, which was completed in 1979 and which served for twenty-five years as a courthouse of the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina. It is named for long-time Senator Strom Thurmond, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Building history The building was one of the last projects completed by the master architect Hungarian Marcel Breuer before his 1976 retirement. To complete the design of the new federal building and courthouse in Columbia, South Carolina, Breuer collaborated with his architectural partner Herbert Beckhard. James C. Hemphill, Jr., an architect from Charlotte, North Carolina, also contributed to the design. In 1975, officials decided to name the still-incomplete complex to honor Senator and former Governor Strom Thurmond, who had represented South Carolina in the United States Senate since 1954. The complex was completed in 1979 at a cost of $23.5 million. Early tenants included the U.S. Courts, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Geological Survey, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 2003, the federal courts moved to a new location, and the U.S. General Services Administration initiated a project to explore reuse of the vacated space. Architecture The building is a stark but sophisticated example of the Brutalist style of architecture. It exhibits many character-defining features of the style, including rough, exposed exterior concrete walls, deeply recessed windows, and a weighty massiveness. Combining a tall office tower with a long, low courthouse and landscaped plaza, the complex's form is similar to that of many Modern-era federal buildings. The building occupies a parcel of land bounded by Laurel, Assembly, Richland, and Park streets in downtown Columbia. The courthouse is accessed through an open courtyard from Assembly Street. The facility contains of space. The sixteen-story office tower has a monolithic presence. Unlike elaborate federal buildings from earlier eras, the tower is stark and unadorned, with its dominant design being repetitive windows with peaked hoods called brise soleils. The hoods serve to minimize direct sunlight, thus reducing the interior temperature during warm South Carolina summers. Like many Modern buildings, the first level is recessed beneath an arcade supported by square columns. The building has a steel frame and is clad in pre-cast concrete panels and dark gray cold spring natural granite. Breuer and Beckhard developed a sophisticated design that resulted in a well-insulated and energy-conscious building. In addition to successfully completing the challenging design, the architects incorporated many security features for both the courts and other tenants. A tunnel connects the office tower to the three-story courthouse building. Breuer unified the complex by repeating the same window form on the courthouse. Like the office tower, the main facade has a recessed first story with a glass street-front arcade. The interiors of both the office tower and the courthouse contain high-quality materials that evoke the Modern spirit of the complex. Glazed, polished bricks cover portions of the floors and interior walls. Concrete coffered ceilings create pattern and texture in the public spaces. Squares and cubes are used as a design element throughout both buildings; granite cubes form the informational directories, water fountains, seating areas, and stairwells. These components are found in the office tower lobby, along with colossal concrete columns that provide monumentality to the interior. Within the courthouse, the four courtrooms are dignified spaces. Wall paneling consists of thin vertical hardwood strips, while jury boxes and judges' benches are built from thin horizontal strips. The plaza of the complex is particularly emblematic of Breuer's work. He understood the importance of creating formal yet inviting outdoor spaces executed at a human scale. The primary materials that Breuer used are warm gray granite and tan concrete, which is typical in Brutalist architecture. He designed a reflecting pool in the sunken courtyard, with grass panels, shrubs, and trees added to soften hardscape features. Two artists‚ÄîBarbara Neijna and Marla Mallett‚Äîwere commissioned by GSA's Art in Architecture program to create works of art for the courthouse. Marla Mallett's large-scale textile work, E Pluribus Unum, was originally located in the lobby. It was later removed after being damaged by adverse environmental conditions. For the exterior courtyard, Florida-based artist Barbara Neijna created Right Turn on White, a large-scale aluminum sculpture painted white. The sculpture consists of a rectangle standing on its side, with the top edge peeled forward to create an arc, which adds another dimension to the work by casting shadows on the rectangular face. Using simple elements of geometry and a refined sense of mathematical proportion, Neijna has created a work of art that is both aesthetically and conceptually compatible with the architectural vocabulary of the courthouse, and yet is set apart from it.

The building is still in use as a federal courthouse, being the seat of the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota. The structure is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Building history The monumental Romanesque U.S. Courthouse in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, embodied and validated the federal government's faith in westward expansion. The U.S. Government purchased a two- lot parcel dedicated to the construction of a Federal building in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, on July 22, 1891. South Dakota's first senator, Richard Pettigrew, introduced a bill to fund the structure, recommending that native Sioux quartzite be used for its construction. Willoughby J. Edbrooke, Supervising Architect of the Treasury and architect for the original portion of the building, designed it to house a post office on the entry level and a courthouse on the second floor. Originally constructed between 1892 and 1895, the building was expanded in 1911 and again in 1931. In the early 1890s, South Dakota was a young state that had recently witnessed a major conflict between the U.S. Army and Native Americans at the Wounded Knee Massacre. The construction of a Federal building at Sioux Falls was intended to create a sense of stability and permanence among the newly arrived settlers. Since its construction, the federal building has been a landmark in the downtown area, where it occupies most of an entire city block. In May 1995, the Centennial Observance of the building was held to celebrate 100 years of service to the federal government. During the celebration, the building was rededicated and a historical marker, provided by the Minnehaha County Historical Society, was unveiled. At the same time, the building was officially renamed as the U.S. Courthouse. Historic memorabilia, photographs, and art were displayed throughout the building. Architecture The original 1892-1895 building was a two-story structure with an attic and basement built in the Romanesque style. Popularized by master architect Henry Hobson Richardson in the late 19th century, the Romanesque style was widely emulated by other architects throughout the nation. The character-defining Romanesque features of the U.S. Courthouse, an excellent example of the style, include handsome, wide (Romanesque) arches; rough-hewn stone finishes accented with smooth stones; and heavy, monumental massing. The exterior walls are primarily of rose- colored quartzite (also known as jasper), which was shipped by train from nearby Jasper, Minnesota. Like granite, quartzite is durable with a similar texture and workability. Unlike granite, however, the surface of quartzite has a slightly translucent appearance. A smoothly finished quartzite that looks much like terracotta was used for the trim and voussoirs (wedge-shaped stones in the arches). Belt courses encircle the building, delineating the interior floors. A distinctive cornice, which echoes the arched shape of the windows on the first and second stories, is topped by a slate roof. The roof form is primarily hipped, crossed by central gable parapet-wall dormers and terminated at each end with octagonal turrets. Entrance to the building is gained through a large, central Romanesque arch on the Phillips Street facade. In 1911, under James Knox Taylor, Supervising Architect of the Treasury, the building was extended 30 feet to the east, and the third floor was added. Substantial interior alterations, compatible with the original design, were also completed. The post office lobby was extended, and a new marble stair was placed in the southwest portion of the original building, replacing the turret stair. An elevator was installed adjacent to the stair lobby. The new public hallways, lobbies, and stairs featured marble baseboards, treads, and landings, and terrazzo with a marble border served as flooring. In 1931, a two-story wing with a full basement was added to the rear (east side) of the building under the direction of the Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore. Like the 1911 alterations, this addition was sympathetic to the original building. The same quartzite stone was used, and cornice and fenestration patterns found in the existing structure were repeated in the addition. Handsome decorative elements and finishes in these areas included marble wainscot and trim, marble and terrazzo flooring, and brass elevator doors and frames. The basement and first floor are organized around a central corridor flanked with offices. The second and third floors have offices located around the perimeter as well as within the central core of the building. The large, second-floor courtroom, and another on the first floor, remain. Interior modernizations have occurred during the course of the building's history, including alterations made in 1968 when the post office relocated to another building. However, many features remain, including the 1911 iron and marble stairs, the oak-paneled courtroom, and two small vaults with mural scenes painted on the doors. In 1974, the building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Significant events *1892-1895: The building is constructed. *1895: President Benjamin Harrison appoints Judge Alonzo J.

E. F. Britten. \\"The Day-Dream\\" is a poem written by Alfred Tennyson that was published in 1842. It was an expanded version of his 1830 poem \\"The Sleeping Beauty\\". It was further altered in 1848 for a dramatic performance for a private gathering with Tennyson starring as the Prince. The Day-Dream discusses the nature of sleeping and of dreaming, especially in relation to individuals that would want to escape from reality. The poem also compares the act of poetry with dreaming and asserts that the two are the same. Background Tennyson originally published \\"The Sleeping Beauty\\" in his 1830 collection of poems.Hill 1971 p. 544 In 1833, Tennyson's close friend Arthur Hallam died. The death greatly affected both Tennyson and his sister Emily, and he kept away from society as he dealt with the pain. By mid-summer 1834, they slowly began to participate together in social events once again. At one occasion, Tennyson, Emily, and their sister Mary were invited to visit friends at Dorking and then travel onwards to see the Hallam family. However, Tennyson set out on his own and spent time alone at Leith Hill, Dorking. It was during this time that he worked on \\"The Sleeping Beauty\\" and early versions of Sir Galahad and The Blackbird.Thorn 1975 pp. 122‚Äì134 The poem was later expanded into the poem The Day-Dream, which was published in 1842. The poem was altered in 1848 for a dramatic performance for a private gathering. In that version, Tennyson played the part of the Prince who was to wake up the sleeping woman.Thorn 1975 p. 223 Poem The poem begins by comparing the act of dreaming with the act of composing poetry:Joseph 1992 p. 38 :A summer crisp with shining woods. :And I too dream'd, until at last :Across my fancy, brooding warm, :The reflex of a legend past, :And loosely settled into form. (\\"Prologue\\" II, lines 1-5) The poem reverses time and declares that the living, contemporary artists are ancient while those who have died before are the young:Jordan 1988 p. 35 :And all that else the years will show, :the Poet- forms of stronger hours, :The vast Republics that may grow, :The Federations and the Powers; :Titanic forces taking birth :In divers seasons, divers climes; :For we are Ancients of the earth :And in the morning of the times (\\"L'envoi\\" I 13‚Äì20) Themes The poem compares the act of poetry with dreaming and says that the two are the same. The dream is able to stimulate the memory of the sleeping woman. Tennyson's earlier works discuss journeys through memory, including \\"Sense and Conscience\\", \\"The Merman\\", \\"The Mermaid\\", and \\"Recollections of the Arabian Nights\\". Out of all of Tennyson's poems, The Day-Dream is one of the few that lack a use of irony. The poem relies on a similar theme as Tennyson's \\"The Lotos-Eaters\\" in that it talks about a living death state. However, The Day-Dream emphasizes the pleasure in being able to return to a sleep state and avoid reality.Kincaid 1975 pp. 49‚Äì50 However, the poem is similar to other Tennyson poems in that it relies on a frame for the story in a manner similar to \\"Lady Godive\\", Morte D'Arthur and The Princess.Hughes 1988 p. 130 The character Flora is similar to many of Tennyson's females that resist their fate by desiring death, including the Idyl ladies Rose of The Gardener's Daughter, Ida of The Princess, and Mariana of Mariana.Jordan 1988 p. 60 In relationship to Tennyson's poems, The Day- Dream keeps up with the anti-didact trend and goes as far as to create a moral about not being able to create a moral. Of any possible moral meaning, there is an emphasis on charity and order.Buckley 1951 p. 83 The parts of The Day- Dream are related to poems in particular. \\"L'Envoi\\" is similar to the themes and ideas of \\"The Lotos-Eaters\\".Kincaid 1975 p. 49 The section \\"The Revival\\" is similar to The Princess or \\"Home They Brought Her Warrior Dead\\" in its discussion of rebirth and a return to life.Shaw 1976 p. 129 Turnbull 1978 In relationship to other works, it is possible that the story of a sleeping woman is the same used by Richard Wagner in Siegfried. The theme is also similar to John Keats's Endymion.Turnbull 1978 p. 60 Critical response Literary critic Arthur Turnbull claims, \\"This is one of the most artistically executed of Tennyson's creations; he was always fond of the slumberous side of things where music is the voice of the poppy dreams of fancy.\\" Notes References * Buckley, Jerome.

It is located near the city of Heavener, Oklahoma. Formerly a state park of Oklahoma, it was transferred to the City of Heavener in 2011, and is now operated by the Friends of Heavener Runestone, a non-profit organization. The Festival held at the park on two weekends a year serves as a fundraiser for operating and maintaining the park. Opened in 1970, the park has been erected around the Heavener Runestone, a runestone found in 1923, and most likely inscribed in the 19th century, perhaps by a Swedish immigrant. The stone is located on Poteau Mountain just outside the town's limits. Transfer from state to city park The Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation Department announced in March 2011 that it would close the Heavener Runestone State Park on August 15, 2011, due to budget cuts. However, the City of Heavener agreed to assume ownership and operation of the 55-acre park beginning July 1, 2011. The park is now managed by a group of volunteers that make a 501c3 non profit organization. Park facilities Heavener Park offers , picnic tables, outdoor grills, primitive campsites with showers available, amphitheater, playground, hiking, exploring, and educational programs about the Runestone. The park also offers the top portion for private use for special events such as weddings, reunions birthdays etc for a fee. Assessment of the runestone Henrik Williams, a professor of Scandinavian languages at Uppsala University has studied the Heavener stone, as well as many other such stones elsewhere in the world. He said that the Heavener stone is an impressive runic memorial, but is unlikely to be as old as some of the local legends claim. He noted that there is no evidence that any Europeans were in this area during the Viking era. He stated that these runes represent the Elder Futhark system that was common during 100 to 700 A. D., which predated the Viking era (750 to 1000 A. D.). Tool marks are still visible on the stone, whereas they should have weathered away if they were created in the Viking era. Runestone Festival The park became the site for the annual Heavener Runestone Festival Fundraiser in 2011. It actually occurs on two weekends each year. Features of the event include Celtic and folk music, swordplay, displays of variety of merchant booths, games, a hike to view the runestone, and overnight camping. Cast and Volunteers are all dressed in costume and many attendees dress up as well. The purpose of the festival, besides pure enjoyment, is fundraising to support the park.

The main courthouse building was built in 1937 in Moderne architecture style. It served historically as a courthouse, as a post office, and as a government office building. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. By the late 1980s, the federal courts needed more space to effectively serve the public. To resolve the space shortage, the General Services Administration undertook a bold plan to purchase, restore, and adaptively use two adjacent historic buildings: the Main Library and the Isaac Baker & Son Clothing Store.General Services Administration page on the Erie Federal Courthouse and Post Office. The existing courthouse was rehabilitated and two additions were constructed. Each of the buildings in the complex is of a different architectural style. Building history 1887 Courthouse The first United States courthouse in Erie had been constructed at this location in 1888 under the supervision of Mifflin E. Bell., also in the service of the Western District of Pennsylvania. This building also served as a post office. It was demolished to make way for the existing 1938 courthouse.Federal Judicial Center Historic Federal Courthouses page on the 1887 Erie, Pennsylvania courthouse. The first United States courthouse in Erie, completed in 1887, as it appeared in 1901. The building was demolished to make way for the current courthouse. Buildings of the modern courthouse complex The 1938 courthouse was designed by Rudolph Stanley-Brown, a Cleveland architect who was the grandson of President James A. Garfield. Built during the Great Depression with funds from New Deal programs, its construction provided local jobs. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. However, the Erie Public Library, completed in 1899 and incorporated into the United States Courthouse complex in the 1980s, is the oldest building in the complex. The Library was designed by the firm of Alden & Harlow of Pittsburgh, and was individually listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The 1947 Baker Building was originally a clothing store. Isaac Baker and Son established its first store in the 1850s at another downtown location. When fire destroyed an earlier building, the proprietor hired Erie architect Walter Monahan and consulting architect George Mayer of Cleveland to design a new building. Construction of the building occurred during the period 1943-1946 by the Henry Shenk Company, a prominent Erie general contractor. Shenk had constructed the adjacent Erie Library, over 40 years earlier, and his company was quite large when it began constructing the Baker Building. Work was stopped on the building shortly after it began, because of the constrictions imposed by World War II; however, it resumed in 1945 and was substantially completed in 1946. The Baker Building was also determined eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The new portions are the Courthouse Annex and the Connector, which unite the annex, library, and courthouse. Both are clearly modern. The design and restoration was completed in 2004 by DPK&A; Architects and Kingsland Scott Bauer Associates. Architecture The courthouse complex overlooks Perry Square, a park named to honor Admiral Oliver Hazard Perry. Other major buildings front the square, creating a monumental town center. The buildings that now comprise the courthouse complex have distinct architectural styles. Main Library The Erie Public Library building The Erie Public Library combines elements of the Beaux Arts Classicism and Second Renaissance Revival styles of architecture. Both were commonly used at the end of the nineteenth century to convey the importance of public buildings. 1937 courthouse The 1937 courthouse building The 1938 courthouse was designed in the Stripped Classical style, which was commonly used for Federal buildings constructed during the Great Depression. The building has the monumental scale and form of earlier classically inspired Federal architecture, but lavish ornamentation commonly found on buildings from previous eras is stripped away. The building is clad in Indiana limestone with polished black granite accenting the building base and entrance area. Carved soapstone panels with a Greek key motif are on the second level. On the interior, the vestibules, lobbies, and corridors are clad with blue terra-cotta wainscot. Ceramic tile floors are bordered with another Greek key pattern. Two original courtrooms remain and are elaborately finished with paneled wood wainscot. Two related sculptures entitled \\"American Youth\\" flank the courtrooms. Completed by sculptor Henry Kreis shortly after the building was completed, the minimal forms are compatible with the architectural style of the courthouse. Baker Building Intersection facing of the Baker Building The Baker Building is a two-story Moderne style building, situated on the northeast corner of State and Seventh Streets. The Baker Building is one of the best surviving examples of the Art Moderne style of architecture found in Erie. It displays all of the character-defining features of the style, including rounded corners, curved glass-block panels, a metal canopy, and a flat roof. The facade is clad in buff-colored brick and is smooth and devoid of ornamentation, also common characteristics. Because of these significant architectural features, the Baker Building was integrated into the plan for the complex as a U.S. Post Office, although a portion of the rear was demolished. Its massing is horizontal and rectangular, with a juxtaposed rounded corner facing the intersection. This is the focus of the building and it contains the sign \\"BAKER'S\\" at the top of the parapet, and the recessed entrance doors at street level. The corner of the building is supported on two black marble columns that contain flanking, recessed, curved display windows. The curving, horizontal lines of the corner are further reinforced with a cantilevered, brush-chrome canopy that starts on the east elevation and sweeps around to the north elevation. The center of the second floor at the rounded corner is articulated with a large, square, glass block opening that is backlit with vertical fluorescent lights. Elsewhere, the exterior of the building is devoid of ornamentation, except for several additional glass block openings on the second floor. The plan of the shop utilizes strategically placed curved partitions to draw the shopper's eye deep into the store. Mezzanines, balconies, and two-story spaces are also positioned to break up the uniformity of the space and provide transition from a room on one level to other rooms on other levels. In addition, balcony railings are long and curving, and subtly evoke a nautical image. The front (west) portion of the shop contains a rounded, two story entrance space that contains a second floor balcony from to gaze down, while upstairs. Directly behind this space is a retail area that contains, on its east end, a multilevel stairway designed to permits shoppers to climb a full flight up to the second floor above, or half a flight down or up to the retail areas in the rear of the store. Support spaces for tailoring, fitting, offices, and air handling were situated around the perimeter of the store. Aside from a small sign on the top of the cantilevered canopy, very little has changed in the building. The curving entrance on the corner, accentuated with the glass block, and the curved, multilevel spaces inside the building, were only been minimally altered during the nearly five decades of commercial use. These features are distinctive, and combine to illustrate the Moderne style in its complete form. The Moderne style of commercial architecture was not prominent in Erie, and no other examples known to survive display the level of completeness and intactness exhibited by the Baker Building. Connector and Courthouse Annex architecture The Connector and Courthouse Annex were constructed under the auspices of GSA's Design Excellence program, which contributes to the rich history of important Federal design by producing high-quality new public buildings. Both new portions are clearly modern construction. However, architects used forms and materials similar to those found on the exteriors of the historic buildings to provide an overall harmonious appearance. The interior of the annex features terrazzo floors and finished hardwoods, most notably on columns and the Shared Legal Library. Commissioned by GSA's Art in Architecture program, two artistic glass windows extend thirty-five feet in height in the new lobby. Designed by David Wilson, the windows evoke monumental columns.

Built between 1932 and 1934 to the Art Deco designs of the architectural firm of Ritter & Shay, the building occupies an entire block between Second, Chestnut, and Sansom Streets and the former Exchange Place in the heart of the oldest section of the city. Its south and west sides border Independence National Historical Park. At 17 stories and tall, the massive building towers above other nearby historic buildings of the shipping, financial, and commercial quarter. The building currently houses federal offices for the U.S. FDA, Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, National Park Service and U.S Customs and Border Protection agencies. The building was rehabilitated in 1991-93 and underwent a major renovation in 2010-13.\\"U.S. Custom House Renovations Nearly Complete\\", CBS-3 Philadelphia, March 21, 2012 It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 25, 2011. Building history The United States Custom House in Philadelphia is a product of the great federal building projects of the Depression era. Begun in December 1932 under the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a massive federal unemployment relief program, it opened on November 10, 1934, having cost over $3.5 million. Distinguished by richness of materials, by the quality of its design, and by a decorative program by a major local artist, the U.S. Custom House is a fitting architectural monument to Philadelphia's status as one of the nation's largest ports. The growth of Philadelphia as a prosperous center of industry at the turn of the 20th century resulted in a greatly increased number of ships entering and leaving the port. As the U.S. Customs Service expanded to fulfill its duties, it outgrew its home since 1845 in the renowned Second Bank of the United States building, which was designed by William Strickland and completed in 1824. The new U.S. Custom House documents the social and economic history of the early 1930s ‚Äî vividly illustrating the WPA's role in combating unemployment through large-scale building projects that employed local craftspeople, suppliers, and manufacturers while providing workers with a fair wage. In an effort to stimulate the economy following the stock market crash of 1929, Congress passed a bill appropriating funds for the U.S. Custom House in Philadelphia. The building's construction helped spur the local economy by directly employing more than 4,000 workers for two years. Construction of the U.S. Custom House was the initial component of an early urban redevelopment plan that ultimately spread to include the creation of Independence National Historical Park and the revitalization of Society Hill. Architecture The final major work by Ritter & Shay, one of the most prominent architectural firms in Philadelphia, the new building respected its historic 18th-century neighborhood through the use of classical details on the broad, low base. However, it also reflected its own time with a bold, setback Art Deco tower with sheer surfaces and a tapered silhouette. The U.S. Custom House occupies an entire city block in the heart of Philadelphia's Historic District between Second, Chestnut, American, and Sansom Streets. It rises 17 stories from its base to its lantern. The , three-story base is clad in limestone with decorative aluminum details and steel casement windows. The classically inspired base is highly responsive to the surrounding Georgian and Federal architecture. Semicircular metal bas-relief panels depicting American industry, commerce, and trade are set beneath the arched door openings of the main entrance. Set back from the base's perimeter, the tower rises in a cruciform plan, and is built of red brick with limestone trim and double-hung wood windows. The building culminates nearly 300 feet above the ground in an octagonal lantern (based on the ancient Lantern at the Greek Island of Rhodes) of white high-relief terra cotta with decorative side grilles and handsome limestone eagles. The lantern, the apex of which housed a powerful light, originally burned logs and crude oil to produce a bright flame by night and dark smoke by day. A 30-space garage was part of the original basement design. The interior was the result of an extraordinary collaboration among Brandywine School artist George Harding, architect Howell Lewis Shay, and Philadelphia Museum of Art director Fiske Kimball (who recommended Harding). Harding's significant mural program consists of a series of 31 separate panels in the vestibule, elevator lobby, and rotunda area. The selection of ornamental motifs, based entirely on nautical vignettes and images of commerce, underscore the building's function. Ships, planes, conch shells, seahorses, and reclining Neptunes in George Harding's murals are all representative of the building's function next to one of the world's largest freshwater ports. The first floor follows a strong axial plan that focuses on a three-story rotunda with an elaborate plasterwork ceiling and adjacent light wells. A coffered plaster dome, supported by eight fluted serpentine marble columns, caps the striking three-story rotunda. Each coffer essentially consists of a large gold shell, and the frieze has eight panels showing the winds as depicted in Greek mythology. On either side of the main north-south corridor are spectacular circular stairs that rise under small secondary domes and provide access to offices on the second and third stories. Although it appears to be in the center of the building, the rotunda is located in the front portion of the U.S. Custom House and cleverly disguises the loading docks, which comprise nearly half of the first floor. The U.S. General Services Administration completed an extensive restoration of the U.S. Custom House in the early 1990s. The three-year project included conservation of original surface finishes, upgrading mechanical and lighting systems, and ensuring access for the disabled. The building is once again fully occupied, and annual energy costs have been reduced 60 percent.

It was constructed to house offices of the United States Customs Service. It was built in 1898‚Äì1901 and is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. It is currently used as the Portland, Oregon location for WeWork, a coworking space provider. Building history Fueled by Portland's economic development during the late 19th century, the U.S. Custom House was constructed to accommodate the city's burgeoning prosperity and status. In 1875, the U.S. Customs Service first established a presence in Portland, moving into the newly constructed U.S. Post Office, Courthouse, and Custom House building (now known as the Pioneer Courthouse). As the city outgrew the space, a new Federal building was planned to house the Customs Service and additional courtrooms. In 1898, construction began on the present U.S. Custom House, reaching completion in 1901. The building was designed in the office of James Knox Taylor, Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury Department, and constructed under the supervision of architect Edgar M. Lazarus. Lazarus is known for his designs for the Vista House at Crown Point and the Agricultural Palace for the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition (no longer extant). Together, Taylor and Lazarus brought the new Custom House to fruition in a style inspired by the English Renaissance architecture of the 17th and 18th centuries, with similarities to the mannered style that characterized London architect James Gibbs's public architecture. In 1938, the east and west wings gained fourth floors to accommodate additional office space. In 1968, when the U.S. Customs Service moved into the Old Post Office Building at 511 NW Broadway, the North Pacific Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers occupied the building, until they moved to a new location in December 2004. The building's scale and distinguished design aesthetically enhances its neighborhood and serves as an anchor on the margin of the North Park Blocks, a row of seven blocks originally intended as open space in the late 19th century. In 1970, upon the recommendation of the Portland Historic Landmarks Commission, the City Council designated the U.S. Custom House as a Historic Landmark. In 1973, the U.S. Custom House was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Current Use After the US Custom was vacated in 2004 the Custom House was considered for an International School though ultimately this was determined not to be feasible and the Property was put up for auction. After an extended process the Property was purchased at auction by Eastern Real Estate LLC in March 2012 with a bid of $4.74 million, with the sale finalized in October 2012. In April 2015, WeWork announced plans to expand to Portland, leasing the Custom House for use as shared office space. In conjunction with WeWork's leasing the entire Custom House building the Property was renovated in phases and WeWork opened for business in 2017. The property was intricately restored under the dedicated guidance of local architect, Dick Kirschbaum, of GBD Architects. Eastern Real Estate sold the Property in Q4 2017 to a new owner. Architecture Custom House building, June 2008 Portland's U.S. Custom House is a large edifice, encompassing a full block bounded by NW Broadway, Everett and Davis Streets, and Eighth Avenue, near the downtown. The four-story building is symmetrical, H-shaped in plan, featuring pavilions extending to the north and south from the central mass. An elegant one-story granite loggia of five tall, arched openings with rusticated walls and a scrolled parapet encloses the entry courtyard and opens onto Eighth Avenue and the North Park Blocks beyond. The U.S. Custom House is an exemplary display of the Italian Renaissance Revival style of architecture, exhibiting Baroque and Mannerist features. The building's first-story walls are brick masonry sheathed in light-gray granite, with rusticated joints and quoins at the corners, and are pierced by window and door openings headed with articulated semicircular arches. A continuous granite stringcourse carved with Vitruvian scrolls and a balustrade above divide the first and second floors. The upper stories are composed of Roman brick with terra-cotta detailing and crowned with a dentil cornice molding supported by scrolled consoles. The flanking pavilions are capped with slate-covered pyramidal roofs, prominently featuring two ornamental vent stacks clad in terra cotta atop a rusticated stone base. A distinctive feature that evokes the interpretative style of the mid-16th-century Italian Mannerist architecture is the ornamentation of the fenestration. This is most prominent with the second- and third-story windows‚Äô display of the \\"Gibbs surround,\\" which is characterized by keystones and spaced blocks surrounding large windows. Here, this motif is composed of terra-cotta displaying bead and reel decoration, elaborately carved quoins, keystones, and Doric order moldings. Framing the second- and third-story bays of the north and south pavilions are two-story engaged Corinthian columns, supporting a continuous architrave, which is capped with a dentiled cornice and a parapet of alternating brick panels and open balusters. Italian Renaissance Revival finishes and details are reflected on the interior spaces of the Custom House. Arched doorways, marble-clad piers, and beams with classical plaster moldings define the three bays of the first-floor entry vestibule, extending into the first- floor lobby where they are articulated with groined vaults and paneled arch soffits. Marble wainscoting continues around the room and extends to the spring line. Each story's lobby is similarly treated, but using ascending classical orders ‚Äì Doric on the first floor, Ionic order on the second, and Corinthian order on the third. A grand cast-iron stairway extends from the center of the first floor to the fourth floor, featuring marble treads, double balusters with spiral and acanthus ornamentation, paneled stringers and soffits, and a molded oak handrail. Originally, windows at the landings opened into a light court, which was covered with solid panels in 1949, leaving the oak framing and trim intact. The existing vestibule and main stair lobbies are well-preserved spaces which remain as the most detailed and significant areas in the building. Typically, the office spaces include plaster finishes with oak baseboards, chair rails, and picture moldings. Although initial plans in 1897 called for two-story courtrooms in the large spaces at each end of the central wing at the third floor, these were omitted from the design after construction began in 1900. While the courtroom spaces were simplified, their large, central skylights in the paneled ceilings above were retained. The interiors were rehabilitated in 1977, removing obtrusive firewalls that had been installed in the stairwells. In 1992, GSA undertook an extensive exterior preservation project to clean, repair, and restore the historic building to its original condition.

The building was completed in 1935, and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, as a contributing building within the New Bern Historic District. Building history As the town of New Bern became a bustling port and mercantile center, citizens required federal services. In 1897, the government constructed a Romanesque Revival building at the corner of Pollock and Craven streets to house a post office and courthouse. By the 1930s, New Bern needed a larger building. Deciding not to expand the 1897 building, the U.S. Department of the Treasury chose a site bounded by Middle, Broad, Hancock, and New streets. Controversy arose when business owners objected to the new location, and the Daughters of the American Revolution passed a resolution opposing the destruction of the John Wright Stanly House, an 18th-century Georgian building on the proposed lot. Officials proceeded with the project after the City of New Bern agreed to purchase the 1897 building for its city hall, and the Stanly House was relocated. Construction of the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse began in 1933. Local architect Robert F. Smallwood designed the building, which opened on April 1, 1935, and cost $325,000 to build. At the time of its completion, it was one of the largest and most expensive buildings in the Eastern Carolina region. For a brief time, the new building also served as a custom house. During World War II, the United States Marine Corps Command Contingent occupied the second and third floors. For much of its existence, matters addressed in the court were brought before John Davis Larkins, Jr., who was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina by President John F. Kennedy in 1961 and who served there until his death in 1990. There, Larkins tried several important cases, which greatly strengthened both civil rights and environmental protection legislation. In 1973, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing building within the nationally significant New Bern Historic District. In 1992, the post office vacated the building but retained ownership. In 2004, the U.S. General Services Administration assumed ownership and initiated a renovation. Architecture The New Bern Post Office and Courthouse in 1935. The building is an example of the Georgian Revival style of architecture. This style is heavily influenced by colonial-era precedents and employs classical ornamentation. The building is three stories and sits atop a granite base. It is clad in red brick veneer that is laid in a common bond pattern. Contrasting limestone trim accentuates the exterior. A central colonnade with six pairs of two-story limestone columns dominates the symmetrical facade. The first level contains five arched entrance openings topped by decorative swag-and-garland motifs executed in limestone. The classically designed entrances have broken pediments surmounted by cast-bronze eagles. A limestone water table encircles the building between the first and second levels. Projecting pavilions articulated by limestone quoins flank the colonnade. Arched windows with classical surrounds span the second and third floors. Classical pilasters support pediments. The same round-arch motif is repeated on two small copper-clad dormers. Double-hung, wood windows are found throughout the building. A parapet with balustrades tops the facade above a dentilled cornice. The steeply pitched roof is covered in slate. A prominent wood cupola with arched windows is capped with a copper roof. The postal lobby spans the width of the building on the east side on the first floor. The east wall of the lobby contains fluted Royal black and white marble pilasters topped with plaster Ionic capitals. Alabama Creme and black marble tiles set on a diagonal cover the floor. The coved plaster ceiling features massive bronze octagonal light fixtures. The west wall of the lobby contains bays that formerly housed post-office boxes and service windows. The upper portions of the bays are filled with iron grilles with painted floral designs. Other remnants from the post office era include wall-mounted postal tables with black marble tops that extend from the eastern wall and are supported by scrolled brackets. Original directory boards are contained in classical frames topped by broken pediments and urn ornaments. Located at each end of the lobby, steel-frame marble staircases have ornamental iron balusters and aluminum handrails with large scrolled brackets. The most significant interior space is the ceremonial courtroom located on the second floor. The walls are clad in mahogany panels punctuated by fluted pilasters with Ionic capitals. Behind the judge's bench is an arched opening surmounted by a broken pediment with a carved eagle. A dentilled cornice encircles the tops of the walls. The courtroom contains bronze chandeliers with eagle motifs that were meticulously designed by the building's architect Robert F. Smallwood. The courtroom contains significant murals from the New Deal era. In 1938, David J. Silvette of Richmond, Virginia, painted three oil-on-canvas murals behind the judge's bench in the courtroom. The paintings were commissioned for a cost of $3,000 through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, U.S. Department of the Treasury. The murals illustrate significant events in New Bern's history and express the themes of justice, liberty, and freedom. The Bayard v. Singleton Case of 1787 established that the legislature's power is limited by the Constitution. The First Printing Press (1749) shows a representation of the earliest press in North Carolina and also illustrates Baron von Graffenried, the founder of New Bern, recruiting settlers to accompany him to the New World. Finally, First Provincial Convention in North Carolina (1774) depicts the first meeting of the local Congress in New Bern.

Ashley and Thomas W.L. Ashley United States Courthouse, formerly the United States Courthouse, Toledo, Ohio, is a courthouse of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio built in Toledo, Ohio, in 1932. It is named for two former Congressmen, Republican James M. Ashley, and his great grandson, Democrat Thomas W. L. Ashley. Building history As early as 1909, Toledo's leaders explored the idea of developing a civic center within the city. Intrigued with the philosophy of the City Beautiful movement, officials determined that Beaux Arts planning principles suited their vision for a monumental government center. Toledo's 1924 master plan formalized the concept. By 1925, the city purchased the quadrangle bounded by Jackson, Erie, and Orange streets and Spielbusch Avenue. The civic center's first structure was constructed in 1926. In 1929, architect Graham H. Woolfall presented Acting Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury James A. Wetmore's design for the spacious four-story United States Courthouse and Custom House to be located within the civic center. The new federal building would replace the overcrowded 1888 federal building located at Madison Avenue and St. Clair streets. Constructed between 1930 and 1932, the new building was celebrated as \\"a monument of efficiency\\" for combining all federal offices in Toledo under one roof. The building is a notable example of Neoclassical architecture in Toledo and was constructed during the ambitious public works program developed in response to the Great Depression. In the early 1940s, Toledo's civic center was extensively landscaped to include an expanse of open space, trees, and a glass-block fountain. In 1962, several agencies relocated from the 1932 building to the newly constructed federal building on Summit Street. As a result, the building underwent renovations to accommodate the remaining departments, including installation of a central air-conditioning system. In the 1970s, the building underwent further renovations for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. The customs service and FBI vacated the building in 1981. In the 1990s, exterior window repair and replacement occurred as well as additional interior renovations for the District Courts and offices. The United States Courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Architecture The courthouse is a distinguished example of the Neoclassical architectural style that dominated public building design throughout the early twentieth century. The style incorporated elements of the Georgian, Federal, Early Classical Revival, and Greek Revival traditions. It is located at the northwest end of Toledo's extensively landscaped civic center. The exterior has remained largely intact since the building's completion in 1932. The rectangular, four- story building rests on a sandstone basement and contains two light courts that admit natural light into the structure. The first-story exterior is faced with rusticated, buff-colored limestone panels, and sandstone covers the exterior of the second and third stories. A standing-seam copper, hipped roof caps the building. On the west and east elevations, wide granite steps lead to projecting, three-bay, centrally located entrance pavilions topped with pediments. \\"United States Court House and Custom House\\" is carved into the frieze. The first story contains arched openings on each elevation. The doors and frames of the building are bronze and decorated with dentils and a flower motif. Engaged, fluted, Corinthian columns span the second and third floors of each elevation, and paired, Corinthian pilasters are located at each corner. A dentil course decorates the projecting cornice and pediments of the building. A granite balustrade lies within the parapet topped with coping, which conceals the fourth story. Although the courthouse has accommodated various functions since its construction, it has remained in continuous use. These functional changes resulted in major renovations of the interior, most notably to office areas. Overall, the spaces retaining significant historic features and finishes are lobbies, corridors, and two courtrooms on the second floor. The principal lobbies and corridors retain white and gray speckled terrazzo flooring inlaid with a marble border. The walls are clad with floor-to- ceiling, flat marble panels. The corridor retains its original plaster ceiling featuring recessed panels trimmed with gold-painted floral leaf moldings and pendant light fixtures. The two first-floor lobbies and corridor feature free- standing, octagonal-shaped, marble columns with decorative plaster capitals. The east lobby includes the two elevators and main stairway for the building. The elevators are set into a marble surround and feature paneled bronze doors decorated with flower medallions. Each elevator surround includes a glazed, bronze-colored, plaster transom, inlaid with a floral motif. The partially enclosed, original stairway is located on the south end of the lobby opposite the two elevators. The stairway is made of marble treads, decorative bronze railing, and a simple wood handrail. The second floor consists of a centrally located, two-story courtroom and a one-story courtroom located on the south end, each accessed by leather-clad, wood doors. The two-story courtroom was extensively renovated in 1998. The walls consist of gypsum board and plaster. Fluted pilasters divide the upper portion of the walls. New elevated benches and witness stands were also added in 1998. The smaller, one-story courtroom contains plaster walls with wood wainscoting and bronze grilles, and a decorative plaster ceiling. The ceiling consists of recessed panels and cross beams featuring decorative medallions. The furniture in the smaller courtroom was relocated from a federal building in Youngstown, Ohio.

It previously served as a courthouse of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, and of the United States Court of Appeals, briefly housing the Eighth Circuit and, then the Tenth Circuit for several decades. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. It continues to house the Bankruptcy court for the Western District of Oklahoma. The building includes Moderne and Beaux Arts. Building history The United States Post Office and Courthouse was the first monumental structure in Oklahoma City and served as an anchor for future federal development. Plans for the construction of the building began in 1903 when Congress appropriated funds for a downtown facility. Due to the region's rapid growth, original funding was insufficient and additional money was allotted in 1906, 1908, and 1910. It was the first federal building constructed in Oklahoma, which became a state only five years prior to the building's 1912 completion. As a courthouse, the building housed the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. In 1926, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit began using the building, until the Courts of Appeals were reorganized in 1929, and Oklahoma was placed in the Tenth Circuit. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit met here from 1929 until 1962.Federal Judicial Center Historic Federal Courthouses on the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Two important cases were decided in this building. George \\"Machine Gun\\" Kelly, a notorious outlaw of the Prohibition era, was found guilty of kidnapping Oklahoma City oilman and millionaire Charles F. Urschel. Kelly was sentenced in 1933 to life in prison and sent to Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay. Kelly's trial was the first in the nation to allow sound and picture equipment in a federal courtroom. In 1949, the case of McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents was heard. The court's decision desegregated graduate schools in Oklahoma. The building is part of a Federal complex that included a separate courthouse constructed in 1959 and the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. In April 1995, a terrorist bomb destroyed the Murrah building causing tragic injuries and fatalities. Portions of the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse, most notably the tower, were damaged by concussions from the blast. Repairs were made to windows, ceiling tiles, and lights. Today, the site of the bombing is the Oklahoma City National Memorial. A new federal building is located several blocks north of the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. In 1992, the U.S. General Services Administration completed a restoration of significant interior spaces. The restoration was recognized with awards from the Oklahoma State Historic Preservation Office and the Oklahoma Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. Although the post office relocated in 1966, the building continues to function in its historic capacity as a federal courthouse and office building. Architecture This landmark building was designed the Office of the Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury Department under James Knox Taylor. The building was constructed in 1912 in the Beaux Arts Classicism style. This style of architecture was commonly used for important public buildings from the end of the 19th century until the early years of the 20th century. The building's symmetry, monumental form, balustrade, and pilasters (attached columns) are characteristic of Beaux Arts Classicism. The original portion of the building is three stories tall and faced with limestone. Pediments, arched openings, and shallow balconies are other notable components of the facade. The roof is covered with red tiles. The original building was enlarged on two separate occasions. In 1919, an addition that doubled the building size was constructed on the west side of the original building. The Office of the Supervising Architect was once again responsible for the design, which was executed in the Beaux Arts Classicism style to blend with the original portion of the building. The facility was enlarged again in 1932 when another addition was completed. Both additions were carried out by the Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore. This second addition, located on the western end of the 1919 portion, once again respected the Beaux Arts Classicism of the earlier portions. As part of the 1932 expansion, a centrally placed tower was added over the 1919 addition. The tower features stylized decorative motifs that are characteristic of Art Deco architecture, which emphasizes the verticality of the design and incorporates Classical forms while minimizing ornate elements.

In 1992, the U.S. General Services Administration restored major public spaces to their original splendor. The lobby, which runs the length of the building, contains a barrel-vaulted ceiling with arched openings that contain geometric, metal grilles. Also in the lobby, the patterned tile floor, green-and-gold starburst ceiling stencils, brass chandeliers, and bronze elevator doors were restored. Elaborate ceilings in the courtrooms, some of which contain skylights with grilles, were refurbished. An ornamental painted ceiling was added to the ninth-floor courtroom. Although the ceiling was shown as part of the architect's original design, it was not executed during construction in 1932. Two murals near the main entrance were painted in 1935 as part of the Works Progress Administration program. Covered up during modernization work, the murals have since been restored. One depicts a Postal Service Pony Express rider seal, and the other is an image of the Great Seal of the United States. The first floor lobby contains two paintings by James D. Butler that were installed in 1993. \\"Sunset Near the Chisholm Trail\\" symbolizes the cowboy heritage and agricultural significance of Oklahoma. \\"A View Near Tahlequah, Cherokee County\\" symbolizes the state's Native American legacy and natural beauty.

Arias P√©rez or Peres (fl. 1110‚Äì1129) was a Galician knight and military leader in the Kingdom of Le√≥n. According to modern scholar Richard Fletcher, he was \\"active, resourceful, spirited and persuasive\\", and the contemporary Historia compostellana says that he was \\"so eloquent that he could turn black into white and white into black\\", although he \\"was not of the great nobility\\" (non fuit tamen magnae nobilitatis).Richard A. Fletcher (1984), Saint James's Catapult: The Life and Times of Diego Gelm√≠rez of Santiago de Compostela (Oxford: Oxford University Press), 157. Family Arias's father, Pedro Arias, was described as a \\"knight of Deza\\" (miles de Deza) in a document of 1115.Fletcher, 157‚Äì60. Arias first met Diego Gelm√≠rez, future Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela, in childhood. Diego's father Gelmirio was also a Galician knight. At some point Pedro granted an estate, a portion of a certain Villa nova, probably Vilanova de Arousa in Deza, to the church of nearby Compostela. His brother Luzo (Lucius) Arias made a similar donation. On 11 January 1096 Pedro and his brother subscribed a charter whereby Raymond of Galicia gave the village of Pastoriza in the parish of Brandariz in Deza to the monastery of Carboeiro (or Deza); they also signed side by side a document of 24 October 1102. Arias's origins among the lesser nobility is further confirmed by the description of his uncle in the Historia compostellan as of the milites (knights) and not the consules et comites (\\"consuls and counts\\", synonymous titles). Arias had a cousin named Leovigildo Luz, mentioned in the Historia, who was the son of his uncle. Arias's paternal grandfather, after whom he was named, was most likely the Arias Luzu who undersigned certain royal documents between 1066 and 1075, including a grant to Carboeiro. In 1062 he witnessed and possibly conducted the survey of an estate at Pastoriza later included in Raymond's 1096 grant to Carboeiro. Between 1095 and 1101 he became villicus terrae of Deza. His wife, Mayor, held land in the Saln√©s, as did Arias P√©rez, who tried several times to acquire more. The Brotherhood In 1107 Pedro Fr√≥ilaz de Traba, the guardian of the heir, Alfonso Raim√∫ndez, rebelled against Queen Urraca and her new husband, Alfonso the Battler. According to the Historia, he was opposed by a \\"brotherhood\\" (germanitas) led by Arias P√©rez (from 1110).Simon Barton (1997), The Aristocracy in Twelfth-century Le√≥n and Castile (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), 50‚Äì51. It is possible that Pedro's rebellion represented a \\"Galician separatism\\" and Arias's brotherhood a \\"Leonese loyalism\\", but it is more probable that Pedro simply had the support of northwestern Galicia and Arias of the south.Fletcher, 131‚Äì35. Arias got Diego Gelm√≠rez, the most powerful churchman in Galicia, to accept the leadership of the brotherhood late in 1109 or early in 1110. In 1110 a truce between Pedro and the brotherhood was broken when the former took over the south Galician fortress of Castrelo de Mi√±o and installed a garrison there under his wife Urraca and the young Alfonso. Arias promptly besieged it, and Pedro came to defend it. The besieged called on Diego to negotiate terms of surrender, which he did, but the brotherhood had grown suspicious of him and when a deal was struck Arias had Diego, Pedro, and Alfonso all arrested. In exchange for the castles of Oeste and A Lanzada, they were all soon released and Diego went over to the separatists.Barton, 179. After the coronation of Alfonso and reconciliation of the Galicians with the queen in 1111, Arias was besieged in Lobeira with the aid of royal forces, and there he was captured in April 1112. Conflict with Diego Gelm√≠rez Late in 1113, when the royal court was in Galicia, Arias was inciting Urraca against Diego. She tried to confiscate the property of the three Bod√°n brothers from Deza, including the monastery of Boda√±o or Budi√±o in Arias's area of interest.On this incident, see Fletcher, 137‚Äì38. In 1120, according to the Historia, Urraca ordered the leading men (principes) of Galicia, including Arias P√©rez, Fernando Y√°√±ez, Bermudo Su√°rez, Juan D√≠az, and others, to do homage (hominium) to Diego Gelm√≠rez as \\"their lord, their patron, their king and their prince, saving their fealty to the queen\\" and recognise his rule (dominio).Fletcher, 147. In 1121, however, after Diego had renewed his alliance with the Pedro Fr√≥ilaz de Traba, his power appeared to threaten that of the queen. In the summer of 1121 she had him arrested at Castrelo by Arias in collaboration with Fernando Y√°√±ez and the former merino Juan Ram√≠rez.Cf. Fletcher, 158‚Äì59, for a discussion of the relationship between Luzo Arias and the brothers Alfonso and Juan Ram√≠rez (fl. 1095‚Äì23), dating from 1075. Diego was imprisoned in Juan D√≠az's castle at Orcell√≥n.Fletcher, 149. Around this time (1121/2) Arias patched up his feud with Pedro by marrying the latter's daughter Ildaria (Ilduara).Fletcher, 162. In the spring of 1126, shortly after Urraca's death and the accession of Alfonso, Arias led a rebellion in Galicia. Diego Gelm√≠rez and G√≥mez N√∫√±ez of Toro√±oFletcher, 248. or perhaps Gutierre Verm√∫dezBarton, 160 n73, says that secular magnate is identified in the Historia only as \\"Count G\\". were charged per litteras (\\"by letter\\") with putting it down. Diego besieged Arias in Lobeiro and, with siege engines, in Tabeir√≥s, forcing him to surrender.Charles Julian Bishko (1965), \\"The Cluniac Priories of Galicia and Portugal: Their Acquisition and Administration, 1075‚Äìc. 1230\\", Studia Monastica, 7, 330‚Äì31. Shortly after 6 January 1129, at the funeral of Arias's mother-in-law, Mayor Rodr√≠guez de B√°rcena, Diego persuaded Arias to give up his half of the church/monastery at Arcos da Condesa in the Saln√©s.Barton, 188 and 278; Fletcher, 159. Diego's opinion of Arias was such that he said to him: \\"I fear, therefore, that if such that you are you leave this world, you will lose eternal life and incur the perpetual condemnation of your soul.\\"Quoted in Ermelindo Portela Silva (1985), \\"Muerte y sociedad en la Galicia medieval (siglos XII‚ÄìXIV)\\", Anuario de estudios medievales, 15, 194, in Spanish: Temo, por tanto, que, si tal cual eres, te vas de este mundo, perder√°s la vida eterna e incurrir√°s en la perpetua condenaci√≥n de tu alma. Diego's words bear no indication that he believed in an intermediate state‚Äîpurgatory‚Äîfor Christians who died in their sins. Cf. the article on the history of purgatory.

Construction and commissioning Knudson was laid down as the Rudderow-class destroyer escort USS Knudson (DE-591) on 23 December 1943 by Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard, Inc., at Hingham, Massachusetts, and was launched on 5 February 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Emmons R. Knudson. The ship was reclassified as a Crosley-class high-speed transport and redesignated APD-101 on 17 July 1944. After conversion to her new role, she was commissioned on 25 November 1944 with Lieutenant Dudley C. Sharp in command. Service history First period in commission, 1944-1946 World War II After shakedown, Knudson departed Norfolk, Virginia on 18 January 1945 for World War II service in the Pacific. Steaming via San Diego, California, she arrived at Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, on 9 February 1945 for training with underwater demolition team units. With Underwater Demolition Team 19 embarked, she departed Pearl Harbor on 28 February 1945, stopped at Eniwetok, and arrived at Ulithi Atoll on 12 March 1945 to prepare for operations in the Ryukyu Islands. Clearing Ulithi Atoll on 21 March 1945 for operations off Kerama Retto, Knudson supported Underwater Demolition Team 19 during reconnaissance and demolition operations on Kuba Shima, Aka Shima, Keise Shima, and Geruma Shima from 25 March 1945 to 30 March 1945. While serving as antisubmarine screen on 26 March 1945, she was attacked by a Japanese bomber. Her guns shot the plane down after two bombs had missed her close aboard. On 1 April 1945, the day that the initial amphibious landings on Okinawa took place, Knudson continued antisubmarine warfare patrols during amphibious landings at Hagushi, Okinawa. During the next two weeks she conducted screening patrols off the western shores of Okinawa in support of the Okinawa campaign. Knudson departed Okinawan waters on 14 April 1945, escorting the battleship USS Nevada (BB-36) to Guam, arriving there on 19 April 1945. She then proceeded to Ulithi Atoll on 23 April 1945, debarked Underwater Demolition Team 19 on 25 April 1945, and departed Ulithi on 5 May 1945 for Okinawa escorting the heavy cruiser USS Portland (CA-33). Reaching Okinawa on 8 May 1945, she resumed screening duty and helped repel Japanese air attacks until 15 June 1945, when she departed Hagushi Anchorage for Leyte in the Philippines. Arriving at Leyte on 18 June 1945, Knudson operated in the northern Philippines until 4 July 1945. She departed Subic Bay, Luzon, as escort for an Okinawa-bound tank landing ship (LST) convoy, reaching Guam on 16 July 1945. After embarking Underwater Demolition Team 19, she departed Guam on 19 July 1945 and called at Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor before proceeding to the United States West Coast, arriving at San Diego on 5 August 1945. Knudson embarked Underwater Demolition Team 25 on 13 August 1945. World War II ended with the surrender of Japan the next day, 14 August 1945, which was 15 August 1945 across the International Date Line in East Asia. Postwar Knudson departed San Diego on 16 August 1945 for the Far East, and arrived in Tokyo Bay, Japan, on 4 September 1945. She operated out of Yokosuka, Japan, until 20 September 1945, when she returned to the United States, arriving at San Diego on 11 October 1945. Knudson continued her service in the Pacific from 30 October 1945 to 12 May 1946, carrying men and supplies to bases in the Marshall Islands, Mariana Islands, Admiralty Islands, and Philippines. Departing Manila Bay, Luzon, on 20 April 1946 with homebound veterans embarked, Knudson arrived at San Pedro, California, on 12 May 1946. She was decommissioned on 4 November 1946 and entered the San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet, on 15 November 1946. Second period in commission, 1953-1958 Knudson recommissioned on 6 August 1953 with Lieutenant Commander J. F. Roohan, Jr., in command. After shakedown and conversion to a high-speed transport flagship, she departed San Diego on 3 May 1954 for the Western Pacific. Arriving at Yokosuka, Japan, on 23 May 1954, she conducted amphibious exercises off Japan, South Korea, and Okinawa. Clearing Tokyo Bay on 13 August 1954, she set course for the Vietnamese coast, where she arrived at Haiphong, North Vietnam, on 22 August 1954. As flagship for the Commander, Embarkation Group, she participated in Operation Passage to Freedom, through which the U.S. Navy evacuated almost 300,000 Vietnamese from North Vietnam to South Vietnam. From 22 August 1954 to 19 September 1954, she operated out of Haiphong during the loading of refugees, cargo, and military equipment by U.S. Navy ships. Then she steamed to Saigon, South Vietnam, arriving on 22 September 1954. Continuing to Subic Bay in the Philippines on 2 October 1954, she stopped at Hong Kong before returning to Yokosuka on 1 November 1954. On 7 November 1954 she departed Yokosuka for the United States, arriving at San Diego on 23 November 1954. Knudson operated out of San Diego and Long Beach, California, supporting amphibious training during 1955 and early 1956. Departing Long Beach on 24 March 1956, Knudson steamed via Pearl Harbor to Eniwetok, where she arrived on 10 April 1956. She supported nuclear tests in the Marshall Islands before returning to Pearl Harbor on 23 July 1956. She returned to Long Beach on 6 August 1956 and resumed amphibious, underwater demolition team, and antisubmarine warfare training operations. She then moved to San Francisco, California, on 27 September 1956. Final decommissioning and disposal Knudson was decommissioned for the second and last time on 2 January 1958 and joined the Stockton Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet. She later transferred to the Texas Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet, at Orange, Texas. While in reserve, she was reclassified as an \\"amphibious transport, small\\" and redesignated LPR-101 on 1 July 1969. Kundson was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 July 1972. She was sold for scrapping on 10 January 1975, for $62,261 (USD), to General Metals of Tacoma, Inc., of Tacoma, Washington.

It has a long, brown body, which offers it camouflage in its habitat, the sandy bottom of the ocean. From its hiding spot on the bottom it ambushes small fish and squid. California lizardfish are oviparous and are believed to spawn in the summer months. Description The California lizardfish derives its name from its elongated cylindrical body and lizard-like head and mouth. The body is uniformly brown on its back, with its sides fading to tan and a white belly. It has a dorsal fin at its midback, no spinous fin rays, a small adipose fin, yellowish pelvic fins ahead of its dorsal fin with about eight or nine rays each, and a forked caudal fin. The longest fish recorded was long, and may weigh up to . Because of its long body and sharp teeth, the California lizardfish is occasionally mistaken for the barracuda. The barracuda, however, is silvery rather than brown and has two similar-sized dorsal fins with a wide space between them, whereas the lizardfish only has a single dorsal fin with a tiny fleshy fin behind it. Range The California lizardfish occurs from Guaymas, Mexico to San Francisco, California. Some specimens have even been found as far north as British Columbia, Canada and as far south as the Galapagos Islands. Although it is most commonly found on sandy bottoms in shallow water ranging from 5 to 150 feet deep, specimens have been found at depths up to 750 feet. The California lizardfish is not sought by most anglers because its flesh has a strong taste resembling iodine, but can uncommonly be taken in fairly large numbers by anglers fishing for halibut and other shallow water bottom-dwelling fish. They will take most baited hooks. Natural history The California lizardfish spends most of its time camouflaged at the sandy bottom, buried or unburied, with its body propped up by its front ventral fins at a slight angle. When prey in the form of small fish or squid swims past, the fish will dart upward to grab it, swallowing the prey whole. This species is believed to spawn during the summer months, when adult fish have been observed to congregate on sandy patches. Young lizardfish are less than long, nearly transparent, and scaleless, with a row of large black spots under the skin of the belly. They may live for about nine years, as the otoliths of a specimen taken off the Galapagos Islands indicates. The California lizardfish is also host to a parasitic tapeworm, Anantrum histocephalum.

World of the Rider War (Movie War 2010) In Kamen Rider √ó Kamen Rider W & Decade: Movie War 2010, the World of the Rider War takes on its true purpose and is home to the evil Super Shocker organization. The backdrop for this world now depicts the destruction of the Nine Worlds. Tsukasa is dressed in the same clothes from the first episode with a different hairstyle, but now transforms into Decade Violent Emotion. Daiki's treasure in this world is Tsukasa's rider deck.Figure Oh No. 141, November 2009 Yuriko Misaki is a girl who lives in this A.R. World who meets Tsukasa during his rampage against the Kamen Riders. She follows Tsukasa, urging him along in his mission to be the destroyer of worlds. Like her namesake from Kamen Rider Stronger, Yuriko has the ability to transform into . It is said that she died in a fight with the Bee Woman years in the past but due to having never found her place in the world, she still searches for it even in death. She finds her place with Tsukasa, the only one who cared for her. In the end, she sacrifices herself to mortally wound the Bee Woman with her Ultra Cyclone attack and save Natsumi from her. Now able to rest in peace having finally having found her place and avenged her death, she disappears. Yuriko Misaki is portrayed by . Super Shocker The evil organization is formed from the last remnants of Dai-Shocker, with the destruction of the Nine Worlds and the destruction of Dai-Shocker. In addition to the high-ranking members Super Doctor Shinigami and Colonel Zol, other villains from the Kamen Rider Series make up the ranks of Super Shocker. They utilize the as their base. Bee Woman The Inhumanoid was a bee-like cyborg with a rapier as her weapon, and previously a member of Shocker in Kamen Rider, being the one who killed Tackle while a member of Dai-Shocker. She is now one of the high-ranking members of Super Shocker, going after Natsumi until she is mortality wounded by Electro-Wave Human Tackle's Ultra Cyclone. The Bee Woman releases the Neo Organism to make her more powerful, only to be engulfed by it. The Bee Woman is portrayed by . Neo Organism The of Kamen Rider ZO is a pool of living fluid that relies on the very container its dwells in as its life support and create a grotesque Kamen Rider-like incarnation known as . Its personality is extremely childish and somewhat sadistic, though it appears it doesn't realize the true nature of what its doing, referring to its attacking the Kamen Riders as 'playing'. Super Doctor Shinigami seeks to revive the Neo Organism in order to destroy Kamen Rider Decade. But once revived, it is beyond Super Shocker's control as it consumes Bee Woman and creates Doras to fight the Kamen Riders. Though Doras is destroyed by a combined finisher from all the most powerful forms of the Nine World Riders, the Neo Organism takes control of the Super Crisis Fortress until it is destroyed. However, it survives and absorbs the Dummy Dopant to become the inhumanoid before quickly meeting its end through Decade and Double's Triple Extreme Rider Kick. The Neo Organism is voiced by , while Doras's vocal effects are provided by . As Ultimate D, he is also voiced by . Super Shocker Combatmen The are remodeled versions of the Dai- Shocker's footsoldiers, resembling the Shocker Combatmen and tending to scream out .

Alternate Kamen Rider Decade In the director's cut of the film, Natsumi has a dream where she sees Tsukasa being attacked by an evil doppelg√§nger of himself which transforms into a version of Kamen Rider Decade Complete Form which has a series of Decade Complete Final Kamen Rider Cards instead of the Kamen Ride Cards of the Nine Worlds' Kamen Riders. This other Kamen Rider Decade attacks the original Tsukasa, shortly before Natsumi wakes from her dream. The scene featuring this encounter originally appeared in the teaser for the film in the television series' finale.

History  Edgeville was established in 1915 as a turpentine company town by the Edge-Howard Company on the East and West Coast Railway. The town was located about halfway between Myakka City and Pine Level. In August 1917, the Edgeville post office was established, but closed only a year later. Mail for the community was rerouted back through the Myakka City post office. In 1919, a public school for African-American children was opened at Edgeville. The white children of Edgeville attended school in Myakka City. In 1921, Edgeville became home to the Manatee Crate Company, who owned a tract of 5000 acres and a mill where logs were collected and cut for the construction of crates at their factory in Manatee. About 75 structures were built by the company for housing workers. With the exception of the crate mill employees, there were very few families living in Edgeville by the early 1920s. In 1923, only 19 households were listed in the Bradenton Area Directory. In 1926, a subdivision known as Manatee Springs was planned for the Edgeville area. A golf course was built to serve the future community, which fell apart during development due to the 1927 real estate crash in Florida. Edgeville has remained an agricultural area, home to a large dairy farm, nursery, and ranch. It is part of the larger Myakka City area and has no retailers or community buildings and few residents.

Internationals Network also partners with other schools and districts across the country. Mission The mission of Internationals Network is to provide quality education for recently arrived immigrants by growing and sustaining a strong national network of innovative International High Schools, while broadening our impact by sharing proven best practices and influencing policy for English learners on a national scale. History Internationals Network‚Äôs history of academic success began in 1985 with the founding of the first high school on the campus of LaGuardia Community College, a collaborative effort between the New York City Department of Education and the City University of New York. In response to the many educational challenges faced by English language learners within district schools, The International High School at LaGuardia was designed specifically to provide quality education for these students. During the next nine years, two additional International High Schools were opened in Brooklyn and Manhattan. To facilitate interschool collaboration and learning, these schools joined together in 1995 to form the International Schools Partnership. In 2001, a fourth school was established in the Bronx. When the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation initiated educational reform through small school development for those students most underserved, they approached the Partnership to recreate its successful model to promote high school age English language learner achievement across the country. Born from the International Schools Partnership, Internationals Network for Public Schools was formalized as a 501(c)3 nonprofit in 2004 to support existing schools and create additional International High Schools nationwide. As an intermediary working closely with local education departments and community based organizations, Internationals now supports 19 International High Schools and Small Learning Communities in New York City, California‚Äôs Bay Area, Alexandria,Virginia, and Washington, DC. Based on Internationals core work ‚Äì almost 30 years of staff and practitioner experience in developing, refining and adapting the Internationals‚Äô Approach in its schools, Internationals now collaborates nationally with districts, schools and school development partners to bring its professional development services to support educators who teach English language learners across the nation. Additionally, Internationals engages with state and local departments of education to increase policy maker awareness of the regulatory issues that both inhibit and promote best practices in ELL education and immigrant family supports. Internationals Approach At International high schools, a badge of prestige replaces the ‚Äústigma‚Äù of immigrant status for students, families, and faculty. The Internationals Approach holds that near native fluency in English and proficiency in a second language are valuable resources when it comes to achieving professional and social success in the United States and the global economy and participating fully in democratic society. In International high schools and academies, every teacher is considered a language teacher as well as a teacher of academic content and skills. The educational process takes place in a heterogeneous, learner-centered, collaborative, and activity-based environment. Students are organized in diverse clusters that often work with the same team of teachers over 1‚Äì2 years. Classes are mixed according to age, grade, academic ability, prior schooling, native language, and linguistic proficiency. They are interdisciplinary and rigorous, and the curriculum includes literature, social studies, math, science, the arts, technology, and physical education. The Internationals‚Äô pedagogical approach to educating English language learners is based upon 5 Core Principles: # Heterogeneity and collaboration : schools and classrooms are heterogeneous and collaborative structures that build on the strengths of each member of the school community to optimize learning # Experiential learning : expansion of the 21st century schools beyond the four walls of the building motivates adolescents and enhances their capacity to successfully participate in modern society # Language and content integration : strong language skills develop most effectively in context and emerge most naturally in a purposeful, language- rich, interdisciplinary, and experiential program # Localized autonomy and responsibility : linking autonomy and responsibility at every level within a learning community allows all members to contribute to their fullest potential # One learning model for all : every member of our school community experiences the same learning model, maximizing an environment of mutual academic support. Thus all members of our school community work in diverse, collaborative groups on hands-on projects; put another way, the model for adult learning and student learning mirror each other. Awards and recognition The Internationals Approach to teaching has been studied by researchers at Stanford University School Redesign Network and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. The Stanford study, led by Linda Darling-Hammond and her team of researchers, found \\"the Internationals Network for Public Schools (Internationals) is an important model that originated in New York City and has shown itself to be both successful and adaptable\\" in California.Kessler, J. (2009). Oakland Unified School District case study: OIHS. Stanford, CA: School Redesign Network at Stanford University. Michelle Fine and a team of researchers from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York found that students at the three oldest International schools outperformed both English Language Learners and Native English Speakers (in New York City) in graduation rates and college going rates. The International schools also maintained lower drop out rates than ELL students and English only students.Internationals Network for Public Schools: A Quantitative and Qualitative Cohort Analysis of Graduation and Dropout Rates by Michelle Fine at The Graduate Center, City University of New York June 2005. In 2009 the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) announced the four winners of its inaugural E Pluribus Unum national awards for exceptional immigrant integration initiatives. Internationals Network for Public Schools was named for its work teaching late-entry immigrant students. Students Today the network serves approximately 6,000 students annually from 90 countries. Over 90% of students receive free or reduced price lunch, and 86 percent of students come from low- income families. High percentages of students have had interrupted formal education due to political, social, or economic factors in their native countries. 70 percent of students have been separated from one or both parents during their family's immigration to the United States.

Since the hemipolyhedra have faces passing through the center, the dual figures have corresponding vertices at infinity; properly, on the real projective plane at infinity. In Magnus Wenninger's Dual Models, they are represented with intersecting prisms, each extending in both directions to the same vertex at infinity, in order to maintain symmetry. In practice the model prisms are cut off at a certain point that is convenient for the maker. Wenninger suggested these figures are members of a new class of stellation figures, called stellation to infinity.

Biography  Early far-right activism  Jean- Gilles Malliarakis is the son of Greek painter 'Mayo' (Antoine Malliarakis) and of a French mother. He grew up in an intellectual, artistic background, as his father was a friend of Jacques Pr√©vert and Albert Camus. He says that he became strongly anti-communist at the age of 15 after seeing a play written by Camus and based on Dostoevsky's Demons. While still a teenager, he began frequenting far-right groups. Malliarakis became close to Action fran√ßaise and Jeune Nation, and eventually joined the student movement Occident in 1964, alongside other notable French political figures such as future government members Alain Madelin, G√©rard Longuet, Patrick Devedjian and future National Front executive Fran√ßois Duprat. He eventually stopped frequenting Occident in 1966 and was formally expelled from the group the next year. Whilst a student at Sciences Po, he created his own movement, Action nationaliste, which was classified as neofascist. In 1969, he notoriously organized a meeting at Sciences Po celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento's founding by Mussolini. In May of that year, he was arrested after a left-wing student was grievously wounded during a fight between student activist groups. Malliarakis, who had been knocked out during the fight, was found unconscious by police forces and put in detention. He was eventually freed three weeks later. In 1970, he took part to the founding meeting of the neo-fascist group Ordre Nouveau. Afterwards, he left frontline politics for a few years, and resurfaced in the a few years later in the mid-1970s when he bought the bookstore owned by far-right journalist Henry Coston and his wife. His shop, the \\"Librairie fran√ßaise\\", became a notorious venue for the radical right in Paris. At the same time, he joined the Groupe action jeunesse (GAJ), a movement which advocated solidarist and anticapitalist positions and a \\"third way\\" between communism and capitalism. In 1979, the GAJ was renamed Mouvement nationaliste r√©volutionnaire (MNR). Malliarakis advocated at that time \\"national revolutionary\\" positions. Historian Pierre Milza described his positions as somewhat similar to Mussolini's early left-wing fascism and Georges Valois's interwar Faisceau.  Troisi√®me Voie  In 1982, Malliarakis attempted to create a coalition with other far right groups such as Pierre Sidos' L'≈íuvre Fran√ßaise, but the alliance was short-lived. He also tried to form an alliance with the GRECE, which held joined meeting with Malliarakis' MNR in 1984, but this attempt was fruitless. An alliance with the Groupe Union D√©fense (GUD) was equally short- lived. With the support of GRECE and the GUD, Malliariakis announced in the autumn of 1985 the creation of Troisi√®me Voie ('Third Way') from the merger of the MNR and the Party of New Forces. The Jeune Garde (Young Guard) was portrayed as a third group, although it was actually a branch of the MNR. During the 1980s, Malliarakis also started working for the neo-Poujadist syndicate Conf√©d√©ration de d√©fense des commer√ßants et artisans, and became a speaker at the right-wing station Radio Courtoisie. In 1991, the Troisi√®me Voie movement split after a conflict with Christian Bouchet's tendency. Malliarakis later dissolved what was left of the movement and retired from front-line politics to concentrate on his work at Radio Courtoisie and to his activity as a book publisher under the imprint √âditions du Trident. He eventually adopted neo-liberal positions and joined Alain Madelin's Id√©es action movement. In February 2007, after the death of station founder Jean Ferr√©, he left Radio Courtoisie as a disagreement with the policies of the radio's new director Henry de Lesquen.LJ Jean-Gilles Malliarakis 23/2, radio- courtoisie.over-blog.com, 23 f√©vrier 2007 He has since then continued his activity as book publisher and as an online politics commentator.

It is located at T-Mobile Park in the SoDo district of downtown Seattle. Museum overview Seattle Mariners former chairman and CEO John Ellis announced on June 14, 1997 the creation of a Mariners Hall of Fame. It is operated by the Seattle Mariners organization. It honors the players, staff, and other individuals that greatly contributed to the history and success of the Mariners franchise. It is located at the Baseball Museum of the Pacific Northwest in T-Mobile Park. Inductees are selected on the criteria that they spent at least five seasons in a Mariners uniform and have been retired from baseball for two seasons. Inductees include Alvin Davis, Dave Niehaus, Jay Buhner, Edgar Mart√≠nez, Randy Johnson, Dan Wilson, Lou Piniella, Ken Griffey, Jr. and Jamie Moyer. Inductees Alvin Davis Alvin Davis throws out the first pitch on Opening Day in 2007 Davis, who batted left-handed and threw right-handed, played college baseball at Arizona State. He broke into the majors with the Mariners in and remained there until . Well liked by Mariners fans, Davis held most of the franchise's offensive team records until the advent of Ken Griffey Jr., Edgar Mart√≠nez, and Alex Rodriguez. He burst onto the major league scene in , homering in his first two big-league games and collecting three doubles in his third. Davis reached base in each of the first 47 games of his career, and was chosen for his only All-Star Game as a rookie. Named the Mariners MVP, he was also voted the American League's Rookie of the Year Award after batting .284 with 27 home runs and 116 RBI. Davis, who was nicknamed Mr. Mariner, was inducted into the Seattle Mariners Hall of Fame in 1997. Dave Niehaus Niehaus was the team's lead announcer from its first game in 1977 until his death on November 10, 2010. Despite working for a franchise who from its first year in 1977 until 1991 was without a winning season, his talent was recognizable, and Niehaus was considered one of the few attractions for Mariner fans. Even in the period before the team's memorable 1995 season, the Mariners were regularly one of the leading major-league teams in terms of the percentage of radios in use. Niehaus was and will continue to be immensely popular in Seattle; he was twice named Washington Sportscaster of the Year. The team chose him to throw out the ceremonial first pitch at the opening of its new ballpark, Safeco Field, on July 15, 1999. In 2000, he was the second figure to be inducted into the Mariners Hall of Fame. In , Niehaus was named the recipient of the Ford C. Frick Award, an award presented by the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum (often called \\"Cooperstown\\", from its location in Cooperstown, New York) which recognizes career excellence in baseball broadcasting and is considered the highest baseball broadcasting honor. On November 10, 2010, Dave was the first member to pass away. He died of a heart attack at his home in Bellevue. He is survived by his wife, three children, six grandchildren, and countless friends. Jay Buhner Buhner was traded from the New York Yankees to the Seattle Mariners along with two career minor leaguers (Rich Balabon and Troy Evers) in exchange for Ken Phelps in 1988. This trade is often considered one of the worst made by the Yankees of that period, and the best in Mariner history. The trade was once noted humorously on the television program Seinfeld, in the episode \\"The Caddy\\", in which the Yankees' owner, George Steinbrenner, appears at the home of George Costanza's parents to inform them ‚Äì mistakenly ‚Äì that their son is dead. All Mr. Costanza can say is, \\"What the hell did you trade Jay Buhner for?! He had 30 home runs, over 100 RBIs last year! He's got a rocket for an arm ... You don't know what the hell you're doing!\\" The clip was played at Safeco Field when Buhner was inducted into the Mariners' Hall of Fame in . Buhner retired at the end of the season as one of the most popular players in Mariners history. The Mariners have not issued his #19 jersey since he retired. According to Mariners team policy, he did not become eligible to have his number retired until . The Mariners require a player to have spent at least five years with the team and be elected to the Hall of Fame or narrowly miss election after spending his entire career with the team. He holds the Seattle Mariners career record for strikeouts, with 1375, and has the lowest career stolen base percentage since (6 stolen bases against 24 times caught stealing for a success rate of 20%; baseball did not keep track of times caught stealing until 1954). He was also known throughout baseball for his ability to vomit on command. Edgar Mart√≠nez Edgar Mart√≠nez in 2009 Mart√≠nez's 18 seasons with the Mariners netted him 7 All-Star appearances, along with two batting titles and five Silver Slugger Awards. He finished first or second in on-base percentage (OBP) in 6 different years, and in the top 5 in the same category in 10 different years. Over the seven-year span of 1995‚Äì2001 he was considered one of the most consistent right-handed hitters in the game. During this time he hit .329 with a .445 on-base percentage and a .574 slugging percentage for an OPS (On-base Plus Slugging) of 1.019. In 1996, he became only the fifth player in the 20th century to hit 50 doubles in two consecutive seasons. He is the Mariners' all-time leader in doubles (514), on-base percentage (.418), plate appearances (8,674), runs (1,219), extra base hits (838), RBI (1,261), total bases (3,718), walks (1,283), and games played (2,055). He is also among the top 10 in other categories including at-bats (7,213), hits (2,247), home runs (309), total bases. Mart√≠nez is best remembered for his performance in the 1995 American League Division Series against the New York Yankees in which he hit .571 and was on base 18 times in 5 games. In game 4 of that series, he hit a three-run homer, then a grand slam home run that gave the Mariners a 10-6 lead en route to an 11-8 victory. His RBI total in that game set a single-game postseason record. The win knotted the best-of-five series at two games apiece and forced a decisive game 5. Down 5-4 in the 11th inning of that decisive game, Mart√≠nez hit a two-run double (called \\"The Double\\" by Mariners fans) off Jack McDowell, winning the game for the Mariners, 6-5. Baseball lore says that Edgar Mart√≠nez \\"saved baseball in Seattle\\" with that double. While his series-winning hit did help build the groundswell that the Washington State Legislature eventually had to respond to (by enacting legislation to fund Safeco Field), it was one of many moments in a \\"miracle run\\" by the Mariners in September and October 1995 that changed public sentiment towards the team and towards public financing of a baseball- only stadium as a partial replacement for the Kingdome. During his career, Mart√≠nez was a Mariner fan favorite, playing his entire career with the team, and always being willing to sign autographs for fans. In October 2004, following his retirement, S. Atlantic Street in Seattle along Safeco Field's south facade was renamed Edgar Mart√≠nez Drive. The Mariners did not issue Mart√≠nez' #11 jersey following his retirement as a player until his return to the team as hitting coach during the 2015 season, when he was issued #11 again. Under Mariners' team policy, his #11 was retired on August 12, 2017. He was inducted into the Mariners Hall of Fame on June 2, 2007 and into the Baseball Hall of Fame July 21, 2019. Dan Wilson Wilson played 12 of his 14 Major League seasons for the Mariners (1994‚Äì2005), catching more than any other player in Mariners history (1,281). He was a member of every Mariners team to have reached the playoffs. His combination of statistical achievement, leadership on the field and commitment to the Seattle community make him a worthy member of the Mariners Hall of Fame. Wilson represented the Mariners on the 1996 American League All-Star team. He holds the Mariners record for most RBI by a catcher in a single season (83, 1996), and at the time of his retirement, he owned the team records for home runs by a catcher in his career (88, including two inside-the-park home runs) and in a single season (18, 1996). Wilson ended his career with a .995 fielding percentage, at the time the highest for any catcher in American League history, and the sixth highest in Major League history. He was inducted with Randy Johnson into the Mariners Hall of Fame in July 2012. Randy Johnson Johnson played for the Mariners from 1989 to 1998. He was one of the most dominating pitchers in MLB history. He won five Cy Young Awards (1995, 1999‚Äì2002), including the first by a Mariners pitcher when he went 18-2 with a 2.48 ERA in 1995. Johnson pitched two no-hitters-June 2, 1990 vs. DET and MLB's 17th perfect game on May 18, 2004 while pitching for the Arizona Diamondbacks. Johnson was instrumental in the team's first-ever trip to the postseason in 1995. During the regular season the Mariners went an incredible 27-3 in games that Johnson started. In a one-game playoff on October 2 at the Kingdome, the Mariners beat the California Angels 9-1 behind Johnson's 12 strikeout, three-hit, complete game. In Game 5 of the ALDS vs. the Yankees, pitching on one day's rest, Johnson memorably strode in from the bullpen for a relief appearance. Johnson held off the Yankees for the comeback capped by Edgar Mart√≠nez's double that scored the winning run, allowing the team to make its first-ever appearance in the American League Championship Series. Randy Johnson retired after the 2009 season with a career win-loss record of 303-166, ERA of 3.29 and 4,875 strikeouts, second only to Nolan Ryan's 5,714. Under Mariners' team policy, he is eligible to have his #51 retired by the Mariners. He was inducted with Dan Wilson into the Mariners Hall of Fame in July 2012. Johnson would enter the National Baseball Hall of Fame on his first opportunity in . While his biography on Cooperstown's official website lists his primary team as the Mariners, his plaque at the museum shows him wearing an Arizona Diamondbacks cap. Ken Griffey Jr. Griffey began his career in Seattle in 1989 and played with the Mariners until 1999. He would later return in 2009 and retired during the 2010 season. Griffey Holds many Mariners records and will always be loved in Seattle sports lore. Safeco Field was referred to by Dave Niehaus as \\"The house that Griffey built.\\" He was elected to Cooperstown at his first opportunity in with the highest percentage ever in balloting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Under Mariners team policy, his #24 was retired at the start of the 2016 season, with a formal ceremony taking place on August 6, 2016. The Mariners also retired the number across their entire minor league organization. Griffey was inducted into the Mariners Hall of Fame on August 10, 2013. Lou Piniella Piniella managed the Mariners from 1993 to 2002. During his tenure, Piniella lead the team to all four of the franchise's playoff appearances. The two most memorable seasons, the thrilling comeback to win the first division title in 1995 and the record-setting 116-win season in 2001, won him AL manager of the year honors. He was inducted into the Mariners Hall of Fame on August 9, 2014. Jamie Moyer Moyer played 11 seasons in a Mariners uniform, compiling a record of 145-87. He leads the franchise in wins and innings pitched (2,093), starts (323), and quality starts (188), and is third in strikeouts (1,239). Moyer was the Mariners Opening Day starting pitcher in 2000, 2004-2006. He also started the inaugural game at Safeco Field on July 15, 1999, with a called strike. Moyer is the only Mariners pitcher to have won 20 games more than once, going 20-6 in 2001 and 21-7 in 2003. He was an All-Star in 2003 and was named Mariners Pitcher of the Year by the Baseball Writers Association of America Seattle Chapter in 1998, 1999 and 2003. Moyer has received numerous awards for his community service. In 2003, Jamie received the Roberto Clemente Award, Major League Baseball's top award for community service. He was also recognized for his \\"character and integrity\\" with the Hutch Award (2003), Lou Gehrig Award (2003) and Branch Rickey Award (2004). In 2000, Jamie and his wife Karen established The Moyer Foundation with the mission to provide comfort, hope, and healing to children affected by loss and family addiction. The Foundation has raised millions of dollars to support hundreds of organizations providing direct services to children in need. He was inducted into the Mariners Hall of Fame on August 8, 2015.

The term is from Greek meteora, celestial phenomena, and pathos, feeling, pain, suffering. History The perceived relationship between changes in weather and pain has been recorded since the classical Roman age. Influence of Weather on Report of Pain, by Robert N. Jamison, PhD, International Association for the Study of Pain Newsletter Hippocrates was the first to note, in about 400 B.C., that many illnesses were related to changes in season.Rosen S. Weathering. New York: M. Evans, 1979 The large body of folklore about how weather affects pain is reflected by traditional sayings and expressions, such as \\"aches and pain, coming rains,\\" \\"feeling under the weather,\\" and \\"ill health due to evil winds.\\" The first publication of documented changes in pain perception associated with the weather was in the American Journal of the Medical Sciences in 1887. This case report described a person with phantom limb pain who concluded that \\"approaching storms, dropping barometric pressure and rain were associated with increased pain complaint.\\" Most investigations examining the relationship between weather and pain have studied people diagnosed with arthritis. After reviewing many case reports, Rentshler reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1929 that there was strong evidence that \\"warm weather is beneficial and barometric pressure changes are detrimental to patients with arthritis.\\" Countering the 1929 barometric pressure claim, in a 2016 article entitled \\"Do Your Aches, Pains Predict Rain?\\" professor of atmospheric sciences Dennis Driscoll is reported as stating: \\"People need to realize that the pressure changes associated with storms are rather small.\\" In fact, Driscoll observes that the changes associated with a storm are about equivalent to what a person experiences in going up an elevator in a tall building. So far, there have not been many reports of people with arthritis hobbled by elevator rides in the medical literature. A study published in the British Medical Journal in 2017 examined reports of joint or back pain from millions of doctor visits between 2008 and 2012 as recorded by Medicare, the U.S. health system for the elderly. It compared these to rain data as recorded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, but found no correlation.The rain, it‚Äôs plain, has no effect on pain Non-English languages The word meteoropathy is uncommon in English, but the concept and similar words are widespread in certain other languages. In Polish a sufferer is a meteoropata, in Italian a meteoropatico, in Croatian a meteoropat, Macedonian a –º–µ—Ç–µ–æ–ø–∞—Ç (meteopat)', and Japanese a for example. The German term Wetterempfindlichkeit ('weather sensitivity') refers to symptoms of meteoropathy, whereas Wetterf√ºhligkeit ('weather percipience') refers to weather-related mood swings.

He defected from the military in 1997 and formed Los Zetas, the Gulf Cartel's former paramilitary wing, under the leadership of the kingpin Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n. Guzm√°n Decena was born in a poor family in Puebla and joined the military as a teenager to escape from poverty. While in the military, he was a talented and bright soldier, earning a position in the Special Forces of the Mexican military by the mid-1990s. During his military career, Guzm√°n Decena received counter-insurgency training, acquired skills in explosives, and learned how to track down and apprehend his enemies from an elite combat group trained by the U.S. Special Forces and the Israel Defense Forces. He began to take bribes from the Gulf Cartel while still serving in the military, but eventually defected to work full-time for the criminal organization in 1997. For years he recruited other members of the Mexican Armed Forces to form Los Zetas. He served as the right-hand man of C√°rdenas Guill√©n until 21 November 2002, when he was gunned down and killed by the Mexican Army in the border city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Biography Career and military defection Guzm√°n Decena was born in a poor village in Puebla, Mexico on 13 January 1976, and finished middle school and high school before joining the Mexican military to escape poverty. His talents and aggressive behavior earned him a position with an elite Mexican military group called Grupo Aerom√≥vil de Fuerzas Especiales (GAFE), originally trained in counter-insurgency tactics for the Zapatista uprising in 1994 and for locating and apprehending members of Mexico's drug trafficking organizations. Guzm√°n Decena reportedly received military training from the Israeli special forces. His training came into practice after more than 3,000 Zapatista rebels seized several towns across the southern state of Chiapas in 1994. The rebellion was a symbolic rising against poverty and the single-party rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and many rebels took arms; the Mexican government, however, sent in the GAFE to put down the Zapatistas. Within hours, 34 rebels were killed and three others were captured by Guzm√°n Decena's counter-insurgency group. Their bodies were then disposed on a riverbank ‚Äì with their ears and noses sliced off. Now one of the brightest, highly trained, and bloodiest members in the GAFE, Guzm√°n Decena was sent to the northern state of Tamaulipas. While operating as the security chief in the city of Miguel Alem√°n, Tamaulipas, he was recruited by C√°rdenas Guill√©n's cartel. Investigators say that Guzm√°n Decena first worked with the Gulf Cartel by taking bribes from Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n and turning a blind eye on the drug shipments of the cartel. Such payments were typical among military commanders, but while soldiers had often accepted bribes from the drug lords, it was not common for them to defect from the army and join their ranks. Bribes were seen by soldiers as \\"benefits\\" to their job, and officers stood firm to the idea that they were protectors of the Mexican people. Guzm√°n Decena, however, shattered that model and left the military in 1997 to work full-time with a drug trafficking organization. According to the British journalist, Ioan Grillo, it is still unclear why Guzm√°n Decena defected from the army to become a \\"narco-mercenary.\\" A common explanation is that Guzm√°n Decena left the military in search of a higher payment, seeing that many cartel members lived ostentatiously and earned more in a year than a GAFE member earned in a lifetime. Nonetheless, he would have also lived comfortably as a successful GAFE member in the army. And by joining the Gulf cartel, he was becoming a fugitive and increasing his chances of being arrested or killed. Hence, a crucial factor in his defection may have been the seismic change of Mexico's transition to democracy and the tearing rule of the PRI. The \\"new Mexico\\" and the democracy that came with it was feared by many soldiers who had made abuses during the old regime. Mounting pressures arose from the families of the \\"disappeared\\" who made marches in Mexico City, and many military officers were found guilty in courts-martial for human right abuses and corruption. For years, some military generals took bribes from the cartels; amid the turmoil, Guzm√°n Decena acknowledged that he was better off outside the system and as a leader of Los Zetas. C√°rdenas Guill√©n then asked Guzm√°n Decena to help him recruit and set up the most ferocious hit squad possible for his cartel. Mexican federal agents later released the conversation between the two after an informant passed on the information of the new unit: Following the orders, Guzm√°n Decena recruited dozens of soldiers from the Mexican military. Some media outlets report that the formation of Los Zetas was the result of a \\"mass defection\\" of a single army unit. But military records show that this claim is false and inaccurate. Soldiers left their ranks and joined Los Zetas over some months and were from a number of different military units, but a number of GAFE soldiers made up a large part of the deserters. The members were given a codename with the letter Z, starting with Guzm√°n Decena with Z-1. Within some months, Guzm√°n Decena commanded a mercenary army of 38 defected soldiers enticed by salaries substantially higher than those paid by the Mexican government. The GAFE soldiers that went to work with the Gulf cartel took with them a number of the Mexican Army's most sophisticated machine guns, assault rifles, pistols, bazookas, grenades, and telecommunications and surveillance equipment. The role of Los Zetas was soon expanded by \\"collecting debts, securing cocaine supply and trafficking routes known as 'plazas,' and executing its foes ‚Äì often with grotesque savagery.\\" G√≥mez Herrera's execution Once Juan Garc√≠a √Åbrego, the founder of the Gulf cartel, was imprisoned in 1996, √Ångel Salvador G√≥mez Herrera (a.k.a. El Chava) sought to take over the assets of the criminal organization along with C√°rdenas Guill√©n. At first, both of them functioned well together: they bought off police officers, bribed politicians and soldiers, and managed to take control of major drug shipments coming in from Guatemala. Although supposedly C√°rdenas Guill√©n's equal, G√≥mez Herrera's manipulative personality annoyed Guill√©n, especially after Herrera's constant requests for money loans. Such behavior offended C√°rdenas Guill√©n, who assembled his own faction within the Gulf Cartel. But in mid-1999, Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, after his daughter's baptism ceremony, ordered Guzm√°n Decena to execute G√≥mez Herrera, the godfather of C√°rdenas Guill√©n's baby. G√≥mez Herrera was cordially invited to ride in C√°rdenas Guill√©n's Dodge Durango after the ceremony. They exchanged laughs and talked for a few minutes. Guzm√°n Decena, who was riding in the back seat of the truck, fired a bullet into G√≥mez Herrera's head. Investigators later found Herrera's decaying dead body at the outskirts of the city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. For killing G√≥mez Herrera, C√°rdenas Guill√©n earned his nickname, the Mata Amigos (\\"Friend Killer\\"), and Guzm√°n Decena, the trust of his boss. Death Guzm√°n Decena was shot dead by Mexican soldiers inside a restaurant on 22 November 2002 in Matamoros, Tamaulipas after being spotted by the Mexican military. Another account written by Jes√∫s Blancornelas indicates that Guzm√°n Decena went to a restaurant, had a few strong drinks, snorted a line of cocaine, and then decided to visit his mistress Ana Bertha Gonz√°lez Lagunes, who lived a few blocks away. In order to not be interrupted, Guzm√°n Decena reportedly ordered his henchmen to block the street and direct traffic. Nonetheless, one of the neighbors called an anti-organized crime agency which called on the Mexican Army. When the soldiers arrived, Guzm√°n Decena was unable to defend himself and was shot to death. After his death, flowers in his honor were placed on the sidewalk outside the restaurant and at his gravesite. According to the photos published by the local newspapers in Matamoros, a note accompanied the flowers and read the following: Similarly, memorials were placed in the state of Oaxaca to venerate Guzm√°n Decena. In an apparent revenge for Guzm√°n Decena's assassination, four members of the Office of the General Prosecutor were abducted and executed near Reynosa, Tamaulipas in early 2003, allegedly by C√°rdenas Guill√©n's men. Less than four months after Guzm√°n Decena's death, the Mexican military captured the Gulf cartel's kingpin, Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, on 14 March 2003. The second-in-command in Los Zetas, Rogelio Gonz√°lez Piza√±a (a.k.a.: Z2), was captured in October 2004 and so Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano (a.k.a.: Z3) ascended to the leadership of the paramilitary gang, and who will become the infamous ruthless leader of the, now independent, Zetas Drug Cartel. The death of Guzm√°n Decena marked the first significant success of the Mexican government against Los Zetas, but unconfirmed reports from within the organization claim that Guzm√°n Decena was killed by \\"his own men\\" on orders by C√°rdenas Guill√©n, who feared Guzm√°n Decena's hegemony.

Nealon Federal Building and United States Courthouse is a courthouse of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, located in Scranton, Pennsylvania. It was completed in 1931, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. Building history Scranton's first post office opened in 1811, but utilized rented space until the city's first federally owned post office building was erected in 1894. The Second Empire-style building soon proved to be too small for the city's needs, an issue compounded by the establishment of the Middle District Federal Court. Following numerous efforts to obtain funding for a new building, the federal government appropriated $2.5 million in 1926. The 1894 building was demolished in 1930. In 1929, chief of architectural design Louis A. Simon at the Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore, completed plans for a new building on the site.http://www.gsa.gov/portal/ext/html/site/hb/category/25431/actionParameter/exploreByBuilding/buildingId/582 General Services Administration page] on the William J. Nealon Federal Building and United States Courthouse. The building as it stood in 1931. With N.P. Severin Company serving as the general contractor, groundbreaking occurred on May 20, 1930. The new federal building was completed the following year at a cost of $1,004,000, with dedication ceremonies taking place on October 19, 1931. In 1981, the United States Postal Service sold the building to the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and moved its main office to a new site, though it maintains a small branch in the building. In 1985, GSA began a $4.3 million rehabilitation of damaged historic materials such as doors, light fixtures, and interior finishes. A glass-and-steel atrium and annex were added in 1999. The annex received several awards, including a GSA Design Award Architecture Citation and a Pennsylvania AIA Merit Award. In 1999, the building was renamed in honor of William J. Nealon, chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania from 1976 to 1989. The building is eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. Architecture The building is a four-story, Art Deco- influenced Neoclassical building executed in limestone and brick with a granite base, green serpentine columns, and terracotta with polychrome accents. Characteristics of Neoclassical style include symmetry, smooth stone surfaces, and colonnades. Art Deco influences are apparent in polychrome (multicolored) ornamental details, low-relief geometrical designs, and decorative forms based on nature. The elevations facing Washington and Linden Avenues are bilaterally symmetrical with the more ornamental Washington Avenue facade facing Courthouse Square. These elevations are sheathed in a smooth- dressed granite base up to the first story, and limestone blocks from the second to the fourth story. Most of the Washington Avenue facade is recessed at the third and fourth floors with engaged green serpentine columns highlighted by terracotta Corinthian capitals. The entire composition is topped by a polychrome terra-cotta entablature. Metal spandrel panels are below the third-story windows and marble spandrels below the fourth-story windows. Three bronze doors with bronze and cast aluminum grills comprise the entrances at Washington and Linden Avenues. The entrances on Washington Avenue lead to the elevator lobby, which is the main entrance to the court facilities on the fourth floor. The entry on the Linden Avenue facade leads to the post office lobby on the ground floor. Historic materials include marble, bronze, clay tile, simulated stone, cast iron, oak detailing, and decorative stencils. Two original courtrooms are on the fourth floor. Each has oak-paneled wainscoting capped by a carved frieze at door height, interrupted by windows and the wall behind the judge's bench. In Courtroom No. 1, behind the judge's bench is a curtained area with oak columns and an entablature with a mural, titled Justice with Peace and Prosperity (artist unknown), installed soon after the building was completed. In Courtroom No. 2, there is a marble panel with bronze grill trim and a drapery surround behind the judge's bench. The plaster ceilings feature a plaster cornice and plaster bands dividing the ceiling into nine panels. Built in 1999, the annex is a four-story, steel- reinforced masonry building with a facade clad in limestone to match the historic courthouse building. Designed by the architecture and planning firm, Bohlin Cywinski Jackson in conjunction with hemmler + camayd architects, the annex fronts on Washington Avenue. Although its restrained design features no overt references to the classical detailing of the 1931 building, its materials and proportions are similar. The facade is divided into upper and lower halves, but in lieu of a colonnade, the upper half is embellished by a row of large, deeply set windows. The annex includes two new courtrooms on the fourth floor, and space for additional courtrooms on the second floor. The courtrooms are notable for their spatial design. Each courtroom is organized along an implied axis connecting the jury deliberation room, judge's bench, courtroom entrance, and major features in the public atrium. Fully accessible witness and jury boxes are set to one side. Clerestory windows above the jury box introduce daylight into the courtrooms. A glass-and-steel atrium connects the 1931 building to the 1999 annex. The atrium is highlighted by an art glass installation by artist Paul Housberg, which was commissioned under GSA's Art in Architecture program. The program empowers the nation's leading artists to create new works of art for federal buildings. The artist worked with GSA staff, project architects, and the community to create artwork integrated into the building's design. Housberg's colored glass wall, entitled Lightfall, consists of backlit twelve-inch by twenty-inch glass blocks.

Douglas Federal Building is a historic post office, courthouse, and federal office building located at Yakima in Yakima County, Washington. It is a courthouse for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington. Renamed in 1978, it was previously known as U.S. Post Office and Courthouse, and is listed under that name in the National Register of Historic Places. Building history Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, who the building was named in honor of in 1978 The first post office in Yakima opened in 1885. By 1910, federal officials selected a location for a new post office and courthouse building in the town. Designed by Supervising Architect of the Treasury James Knox Taylor, the building is Yakima's premier example of Second Renaissance Revival style architecture. To celebrate the grand building's opening in June 1912, Postmaster W.L. Lemon hosted an open house and employees led citizens on tours. The building's first tenants included the post office, federal courts, U.S. Marshals, Reclamation Service, Land Office, and Weather Bureau. The first court case was tried in the building in July 1912. In 1926, a single-story annex was added to the rear of the building. In 1939, Supervising Architect of the Treasury Louis A. Simon designed three-story wings that extended the north and south elevations to the east; Simon also demolished and replaced the 1926 annex with a single-story addition that connected the wings. Construction was complete by 1940. In 1987, the architectural firm of Paddock & Hollingbery designed a two-story, brick- faced infill addition that was built on the existing rear addition. At the same time, interior spaces were renovated and restored, and the building's mechanical systems were upgraded to current standards. In 1978, Congress passed a resolution to rename the building to honor Justice William O. Douglas, who served on the Supreme Court from 1939, when he was nominated by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, until his retirement in 1975. Although born in Minnesota, Douglas grew up in Yakima. With a term of more than 36 years, Justice Douglas remains the longest-serving justice in Supreme Court history. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Architecture The monumental William O. Douglas Federal Building is an excellent example of Second Renaissance Revival architecture, a classically inspired and dignified style that conveyed the stability of the federal government. The nearly square, three-story structure features concrete spread footings, a steel frame, reinforced concrete floors, and exterior brick walls that are faced in high-quality granite and limestone. The symmetrical facade faces west onto South Third Street and first story is clad with deeply incised rusticated New Hampshire granite. This first-story articulation is a character-defining feature of Second Renaissance Revival architecture. A belt course divides the first and second levels. Smooth Indiana limestone panels clad the upper stories. Recessed bays flank a central, seven-bay, projecting pavilion. The street level is dominated by a series of regularly spaced round- arch openings containing both double-hung sash windows and entry doors, all of which feature fanlights. Radiating voussoirs surround each of the arched openings. Recessed entrances are located at each end of the projecting pavilion, and the entry stairs are flanked by tall, cast-bronze pedestal lamps topped with spherical globes. Articulated voussoirs capped with pediments top the pavilion's second story flat-arch windows. Textured consoles featuring anthemia leaves support the pediment's gable returns. Projecting window sills are supported by brackets that flank simple rectangular panels. Smaller square windows with prominent scrolled keystones are aligned above the second-story windows. Upper story windows are separated by two-story engaged Ionic order columns that form an impressive colonnade that dominates the central upper bays of the facade. The colonnade supports an unadorned architrave and frieze that are surmounted by a molded cornice with prominent modillion blocks. A parapet with a classical balustrade tops the building. The architects of subsequent additions successfully designed them to be compatible with the existing building. The wings, added in 1940, extend to the east on both the north and south elevations and employ similar materials and design tenets. However, instead of modillion blocks, a convex molding is in place on the wings' cornice. South wing walls are clad in buff-colored brick. The 1987 infill uses a similar brick finish. Interior spaces retain many original materials and features. Although no longer a tenant, the post office originally occupied the first floor. Large round-arched postal windows with oak frames and sash remain in the postal lobby. Bronze postal lock boxes featuring Greek key patterns also allude to the space's prior use. Floors are covered in terrazzo with dark marble borders. The baseboard and wainscot are grey Vermont Light Cloud Rutland marble, while remaining wall surfaces are covered in plaster. A coffered ceiling tops the lobby and features pendant lights that date to 1940. A marble staircase is located at the lobby's south end. The two-story, second-floor courtroom also retains some historic features. Details include original oak panel doors with classical surrounds, wainscot, baseboards, plaster walls with classically inspired panel molding, and ornamental plaster ceilings. Second-floor corridors have plaster walls with marble baseboards and oak chair rails. Square 1940 light fixtures remain. File:Exterior door, William O.

It is a courthouse for the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. It was built in 1908 by Clarke & Howe of limestone and steel and has a courtyard in the center. Building history A plaque commemorates Abraham Lincoln's 1860 address in the Railroad Hall, which previously stood on the site of the Federal Building. In 1900 the rapidly growing city of Providence began pressing Rhode Island's congressional delegation and officials in Washington about the need for a new federal building to replace the U.S. Customshouse. Congress was ultimately persuaded, in 1902, to appropriate $1 million for a post office, courthouse and custom house. In return, the city donated a site across from City Hall, at the eastern end of Exchange Place, to the federal government. The transfer was completed July 7, 1902. The following year, the U.S. Treasury Department held a national design competition that attracted ten entries. The local firm of Clarke and Howe was unanimously selected as the winner. The jury, which consisted of James Knox Taylor, Supervising Architect of the Treasury, and several other prominent architects, remarked that the design was \\"an artistic building, excellently planned for its purpose,\\" and that it would be \\"an ornament to the city of Providence.\\" It was one of 35 federal buildings contracted to architectural firms under the provisions of the Tarsney Act of 1893. The Act authorized the Treasury Secretary to use private architects, selected through competition, to design Federal buildings and reflected a growing demand for greater architectural standards for public buildings. Contractors Horton and Hemenway began construction in 1904‚Äîonly two years after passage of the first omnibus public buildings law, which significantly changed the federal construction process. Construction was closely monitored by the Supervising Architect's Office with monthly progress photographs and building material samples sent to Washington. Construction required relocating railroad tracks and bridging the Providence River. Completed in 1908 at a cost of about $1.3 million, the Providence Post Office, Court House and Custom House was hailed as one of the finest federal buildings outside Washington. Customs and postal functions were relocated over the years and the building was turned over to the U.S. General Services Administration in 1961. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Extensive renovation and restoration activities have been undertaken, most notably in the late 1970s and again in 1999-2001. The exterior of the Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse is virtually unchanged, and the lobby and two major courtrooms have been restored. Architecture Located at the east end of Kennedy Plaza (formerly known as Exchange Place), in downtown Providence, the Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse is a notable example of the Beaux Arts style. The design seems to owe aspects of its form and detail to the New York Custom House (1900‚Äì1907), designed by Cass Gilbert. Completed in 1908, it is a five-story, rectangular structure, faced in New Hampshire granite over a steel frame, with a rusticated base. The building is almost perfectly on axis with the Second Empire style Providence City Hall (1873‚Äì1874) at the opposite end of the plaza, and was designed to complement it in style and massing. The building is seven bays wide on the east and west sides and twelve bays long on the north and south sides. The east and west facades are dominated by central projecting pavilions. Each pavilion is articulated by four, three-story Corinthian order columns flanking window openings and linked by balustrades. At the second story, French windows are framed by engaged Doric columns and topped with sculptured swags and car-touches. Arched openings, enriched by keystones and swags, encompass the double-height windows that light the interior court-rooms at the third story. The north and south sides of the building are less ornate. Above the rusticated base are a series of tripartite window openings flanked by colossal Corinthian pilasters. A heavy balustrade rises above the fourth-story cornice. It runs around all four sides, partially concealing the fifth story and the batten-seam lead-coated copper roof. Allegorical statuary Two groups of allegorical statues, designed by J. Massey Rhind of New York, flank the major entrances on the building's west side. The marble statues are twice life-size, and each consists of a central seated figure with smaller figures on either side. The group on the right represents \\"the Nation as Sovereign Power,\\" flanked by \\"Justice, and Law and Order\\"; the one on the left depicts \\"Providence as Independent Thought,\\" flanked by \\"Industry and Education\\". Ornate details in the interior The main lobby, located inside the west entrance, extends the width of the building. Finished in Indiana limestone, it has a , groin-arched and coffered ceiling that is detailed with rosettes. The ceiling remains among the building's most distinctive features. The curving main staircase opens off the south end of the lobby and leads to the upper stories. Perhaps the most impressive interior space is the double-height chamber of the Federal District Court, located on the third floor above the west entrance. The walls are paneled in oak set behind paired colossal columns supporting an entablature topped by a vaulted ceiling with an elliptical stained-glass skylight. The main entrance, on axis with the judge's bench, is framed by pilasters carrying a broken segmental pediment, set on beautifully carved consoles. At the center of the pediment is an eagle, carved in oak, above a wreath with crossed flags and fasces. The courtroom of the Equity Court is on the east side of the third floor. While somewhat smaller than the courtroom of the District Court, it is also a double-height space. The walls are similarly paneled in oak and set behind fluted columns and pilasters that support an entablature at the ceiling level.

Building history left The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse in Charleston, South Carolina, is located on the southwest corner of Meeting and Broad streets at the intersection known as the \\"Four Corners of Law.\\" On the northwest corner, a 1792 courthouse represents the role of county government in Charleston. City Hall, built in 1802 on the northeast corner, symbolizes the presence of municipal government. Finally, St. Michael's Episcopal Church, built between 1752 and 1761, signifies divine law as a component in community life when the Anglican Church was the established church of the community. The Charleston Post Office is one of the oldest in the United States, having been established by George III in 1740, during the provisional colonial governorship of William Bull. The site of today's U.S. Post Office and Courthouse was originally called Trott's wharf. A guardhouse and armory was built there in the 1830s. Colonel Isaac Hayne was incarcerated in the basement and executed by the British in this complex in 1781. The guardhouse was destroyed during the devastating 1886 Charleston earthquake. A decade later, the site was redeveloped. left In 1887, Congress authorized funds for construction. South Carolina architect John Henry Devereux designed the building. He had immigrated as a young child with his family from Ireland. He started work as a plasterer, and later studied with a leading architect. He became an architect and builder of churches and public buildings in South Carolina's Lowcountry. In 1885, Devereux was appointed as Superintendent of Construction and Repairs of the U.S. Treasury Department, which then managed public buildings. It was in this capacity that he designed the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse. He selected the Second Renaissance Revival style to convey the grandeur associated with public architecture at that time. Construction of the building was not finished until 1896; a gala viewing complete with a German band took place. Completed for a cost of $500,000, the building is credited with playing an important role in the downtown revitalization of Charleston at the end of the 19th century. The building was individually listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, and is also within the boundaries of the National Historic Landmark Charleston Historic District. Architecture The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse is an excellent example of Second Renaissance Revival architecture. This style conveyed the dignity of government and was often used for civic buildings during the late nineteenth century. Some of the hallmarks of the Renaissance Revival style found on the building include a prominent cornice, balustrades, and quoins (corner blocks). Belt courses, another common feature, encircle the building at each level. The building is clad in granite quarried from Winnsboro, South Carolina. On the first story, the granite is finished in rock-faced coursed blocks that are slightly darker in tone than the smooth blocks used on the remainder of the building. The quoins also have a rough finish. Openings on the first story are arched, which is another characteristic of the Second Renaissance Revival style. The second story features rectangular window openings topped with prominent triangular pediments and flanked with pilasters (attached columns). The pilasters are paneled on the bottom, but fluted with parallel, vertical, linear grooves on the top. This pattern continues on pilasters found in the interior lobby. Windows on the third floor are flanked with plain pilasters, but have molded trim above the openings. Pediments with dentils (square blocks) are centrally located on the top story of the street-front facades. A prominent corner tower that ascends a full story above the rest of the building is located at the confluence of Meeting and Broad Streets. The uppermost story of the tower contains a series of arched windows. The tower is topped with an open balustrade. The interior contains opulent public spaces, which were restored in 2002. Like the dignified exterior, the interior splendor indicates the importance of public buildings at the end of the nineteenth century. The postal lobby on the first floor appears much as it did when the building opened in 1896. Rich finishes include red Brazilian marble wainscot and floors, and mahogany walls at the sales and box areas. The grand staircase is ornately finished. The same red Brazilian marble is used on the runners and wainscot, but the risers and the railing are ornamented brass. The prominent brass newel posts are topped with finials and connected by mahogany railings. Ornate brass designs with geometric, curvilinear patterns and rosettes are beneath the railings. Massive plaster columns are painted in a faux marble technique to emulate the red marble and rest on hexagonal brass bases. The magnificent effect of these high-quality finishes is distinctive to the Victorian era. The courtroom on the second floor features many handsome original details, most notably carved woodwork. The room has carved mahogany wainscot and elaborate mahogany window surrounds. A carved mahogany panel with floral and patriotic motifs, including a shield with stars and stripes, is located directly behind the judge's bench. Oil portraits of past U.S. District judges hang on the walls. On the second and third floors, many original wood- panel doors with mahogany pilasters remain. In 1922, a modest, single-story, gray concrete addition for service functions was added to the south side of the building. The Hollings Judicial Center was also added to the south side in the 1980s.

Completed in 1861, the structure is now leased by the General Services Administration to the Galveston Historical Foundation. The courthouse function was replaced in 1937 by the Galveston United States Post Office and Courthouse. Building history The building symbolized the importance and prosperity of Galveston which was Texas' leading seaport and commercial city during the nineteenth century, and the port where most of the imported commercial goods entered the state. The city's business community was primarily concerned with wholesale commerce, and furnished the trade goods for all of Texas, the Indian Territory, and parts of Louisiana and New Mexico. With rising revenue from customs receipts, the United States Congress approved funds in 1855 for a new U.S. custom house. Supervising Architect of the Treasury Ammi Burnham Young produced the original design for the building in 1857. Public officials immediately rejected Young's three-story design on the grounds that it lacked sufficient space. A new scheme by Charles B. Cluskey (1805‚Äì1871) and E.W. Moore (1810‚Äì1865) was accepted in 1859. Their design was based on Young's concept, but provided additional space for the Custom Service and Post Office. The building was begun in 1860 and completed in 1861. The Boston firm of Blaisdell and Emerson built it in 114 days, an unprecedented accomplishment at the time. The extensive use of fireproof cast iron was revolutionary then and likely accounted for the building's survival from the 1885 Galveston fire. During the Civil War, the Confederate Army occupied the building. In 1865 it was the site of the ceremony officially ending the war in Galveston. The U.S. Government resumed occupancy that year after making extensive repairs. It served as a courthouse for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas from 1862 until 1891, and was then retired from court service for a time. The Court House in 1917 Significant alterations were made in 1917, when the General Services Administration added courtrooms and judicial offices to the second floor of the U.S. Custom House, which then became the Federal Courthouse, serving the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. This location would later become the seat of the Galveston Division, after congress added a second judgeship in the 1930s.General Services Administration: U.S. Custom House, Galveston, Texas The building continued to serve as a courthouse until 1917, and housed offices for federal agencies throughout the twentieth century. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. In 1998 the Galveston Historical Foundation signed a cooperative agreement with the U.S. General Services Administration that permitted the Foundation to lease and rehabilitate the building for its headquarters. Architecture The U.S. Custom House in Galveston is a simply detailed Classical Revival, two-story, brick building located near the waterfront in Galveston. The most notable features are the projecting double gallery on the west facade and the inset double galleries on the longer, north and south facades. The exterior walls are hard-fired, red- brown bricks with tan bricks used as accents around the corners and doorjambs. The prominent location at the southeast corner of Twentieth and Post Office (Avenue E) Streets emphasizes its importance to Galveston's shipping-based economy. Nearly all the original decorative elements on the exterior of the building are cast iron including columns, cornices, balustrades, dentils, entablatures, and window architraves. These elements from the specifications and designs of the original architect Ammi B. Young, were made in New York City and shipped to Galveston. The first-story galleries have Ionic columns set on a granite base. An entablature extends completely around the building separating the first and second floors. The piano nobile is larger in height, and the galleries contain taller, Corinthian columns and a cast-iron balustrade. A classically inspired balustrade caps the building. The interior of the building is H-shaped in plan and was originally designed to provide space for the Customs Service and the Post Office. Extant original elements include the elaborate cast-iron, double-return stair leading to the second floor. The stair's ornamental newel posts have an acanthus motif and fluted shafts set on octagonal bases. The cast-iron risers are pierced with a circular fret design. In 1917 the U.S. Custom House was converted for use as a Federal courthouse and a courtroom was created on the second floor. The U.S. Custom House survived the Civil War and various disasters including the 1885 Galveston Fire, the Great Galveston Hurricane of 1900, Hurricane Carla in 1967, and a boiler explosion in 1978 that resulted in the closing of the second floor for almost two decades. Although these events required extensive repairs and renovations, the U.S. Custom House's fireproof construction ensured the survival of its most significant stylistic elements. In 1998 a public-private partnership was established between the U.S. General Services Administration and the Galveston Historical Foundation to allow for the restoration of the building by the Galveston Historical Foundation for use as its headquarters and historic preservation resource center. Assisted by private donations, the careful and sensitive rehabilitation included the removal of 1960s dropped ceilings, the restoration of the second floor, and the removal of the non-original interior wood shutters. The Galveston Historical Foundation formally moved into the refurbished U.S. Custom House in June 1999.

Garcia Federal Building and United States Courthouse is a historic courthouse, federal office, and post office building located in Downtown San Antonio in Bexar County in the U.S. state of Texas. It was formerly the U.S. Post Office, Federal Office Building and Courthouse. It is the courthouse for the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Texas. It holds a prominent location on Alamo Plaza, across from the Alamo. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as San Antonio U.S. Post Office and Courthouse. Building history The building was a product of the Federal Public Works programs enacted to relieve widespread unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Its construction accomplished several goals‚Äîgenerating employment, housing all federal agencies in a single building, and streamlining San Antonio's quickly expanding postal needs. Prominent local architect Ralph Haywood Cameron (1892‚Äì1970) designed the building in association with renowned Philadelphia architect Paul Philippe Cret under the direction of the Office of the Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury Department. Both Cameron and Cret studied at the prestigious √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Cameron, a native Texan who also designed the Dewitt County Courthouse, went on to become one of the leading Beaux-Arts architects of south Texas, and Cret was nationally recognized as one of the foremost practitioners of the style. A ceremonial cornerstone was laid for the new federal building in 1935. Construction was completed in 1936, and the building officially opened in 1937. At that time, the first floor and basement were air-conditioned, a new technology that had not been installed in the any other post office in the country. Shortly after the building's completion, noted artist Howard Cook painted an epic 16-panel fresco mural in the entry lobby; it is regarded as one of the showpieces of the federal mural program. Cook was selected from among 185 artists in a national competition conducted by the Treasury Department's Section of Fine Arts. In 1999, art conservators restored the mural to its original brilliance. The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse is located in the Alamo Plaza Historic District. In 2000, the building was individually listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It was renamed the Hipolito F. Garcia Federal Building and United States Courthouse in 2004 to honor Judge Hipolito Frank Garcia (1925‚Äì2002).Public Law 108-467, 108th Congress, \\" To designate the Federal building and United States courthouse located at 615 East Houston Street in San Antonio, Texas, as the Hipolito F. Garcia Federal Building and United States Courthouse, Dec. 21, 2004 Architecture A skillful example of Beaux-Arts classicism, the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse is indicative of the federal government's goal of expressing democratic ideals through classically derived architecture featuring grand scale, symmetry, and refined details. The six-story building encompasses an entire city block and is constructed of steel and concrete clad in rich local materials‚ÄîTexas Pink granite and Texas Cream limestone. The building is polygonal in plan, centered on a central light court. Its facade (south elevation) emphasizes a centrally recessed porch behind a screen of six monumental Ionic columns, rising to support an entablature that continues all around the building. At the first story, the principal approach is created by broad steps of Texas Pink granite spanning the width of the building, leading to three arched entrances with keystones, alternating with four rectangular windows with decorative metal grilles. Limestone masonry walls are articulated by chamfered joints, rising to an overhanging stringcourse. The limestone walls of the upper stories are smooth in contrast, but are also divided into seven bays, featuring rectangular windows at the second story, and elongated fenestration formed by vertically stacked windows at the third and fourth stories. Above the entablature, the attic (sixth) story is similarly clad in smooth limestone veneer with rectangular fenestration flanked by flat pilasters. At the edge of the low-pitched mansard roof, six decorative stone acroteria (urn-like ornaments) are aligned with the pilasters and columns below. On the interior, the Beaux-Arts tradition of grand entrances and circulation areas is boldly expressed by the entry and postal lobbies' rich architectural detail and ornamentation. The entry lobby is distinguished by a series of bracketed entryways capped by blind arches with egg-and-dart moldings. Light-colored St. Genevieve marble covers the walls up to the springing course. The most vibrant feature is Howard Cook's outstanding 16-panel mural, \\"San Antonio's Importance in Texas History.\\" The mural is a fresco, a technique of paint applied directly over wet plaster, and spans , making it one of the largest frescoes in the nation. Cook's mural evokes historical events in Texas, including the arrival of the first Conquistadors, the signing of the Texas Declaration of Independence, and the arrival of the railroad. The postal lobby features its original bronze and glass-topped tables, with 41 bronze sales window-boxes capped by a continuous band of fretwork and divided by marble Doric pilasters that rise to a wide dentiled cornice. The floors are Tennessee Golden Veined Pink marble, with dark cedar- colored marble bases, and light-colored St. Genevieve marble for the wainscot. Original bronze light fixtures grace the lobby in a variety of decorative motifs depicting eagles and shields. The ceremonial courtroom, located in the south wing of the third floor, is a light-filled two-story space, featuring six bronze pendant chandeliers and dark-stained wood for the wainscot and all of the built-in furniture, including the original judge's bench, witness stand and clerk's desk. Tall, painted pilasters extend from the wainscot to a wide ornamental plaster entablature. The judge's bench is framed by an arched niche enriched with wide, intricately decorated plaster ornament, moldings, and gilding, contributing to the impressive character of the room. The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse retains its character-defining details and craftsmanship, and continues to convey its significance as an excellent example of a monumental Beaux-Arts-style public building in San Antonio.

She entered the pink film profession at the advanced age of 29, became a star in the field at 31, and won a Best Actress award for her work in this genre in 2003 at the age of 36. Life and career Early life Motoko Sasaki was born on February 15, 1967. She became interested in the stage in middle school, and first began acting in her high school drama club. She had an invitation to pursue the study of acting after graduation from high school, but her father believed that a girl should not attend college. Sasaki wound up working as a civil servant in the same government district as her father. She continued acting in community theater at this time, gaining acting experience in the Shingeki style. She reports that the turning point in her life came when a traveling drama troupe visited her community. The director told her that if she were serious about acting, she would have to learn the basics at training school. She was 22 years of age at the time, and she decided to reject the typical life of marriage and raising children; with 1.5 million yen saved from her salary, she moved to Tokyo to pursue an acting career. Stripping career In Tokyo Sasaki was recruited to perform as a stripper. To cover the cost of living, Sasaki accepted the job. Since she had never seen a strip show, she attended a performance in Ueno. By the end of the performance she had determined to look at the experience as a form of \\"training school\\" in dialogue-free body acting. Performing four times a day for a relatively modest 20 million yen a month, Sasaki feels she could have made more money at a hostess bar. But Sasaki stuck with this profession, as it did not require she have physical contact with the audience, and it allowed her to experiment and expand on her craft with each performance. She invested her earnings into her wardrobe and put effort into her interpretations of the songs to which she danced. For three years she studied acting during the day and stripped in the evenings. Recalling the devotion of her fans, including grandfathers who would give her gifts after the show, she remembers this career with fondness. Film career Sasaki made her pink film debut in 1996 at the unusually advanced age of 29. She later joked that since young actresses are not abundant in pink films, she felt confident in her new line of work. Sasaki's first film was , directed by respected pink film veteran actor-director Yutaka Ikejima. Her second film for Ikejima, Beautiful Secretary: Rip Off the Panty Hose (1997), won Sasaki the Best New Actress, Third Place award at the Pink Grand Prix. The film was named fourth best pink release of the year. Sasaki's acting training and experience has given her versatility in her pink film career, in which she is competent in both serious and comic roles. Her sensual and charming performance style recalls that of the classic Nikkatsu Roman Porno Queens. Director Sachio Kitazawa's The Horny Widow (1998) was a light erotic film starring Sasaki as the widow of a jeweler, having an affair and suffering at the hands of a rapist and blackmailer. The film became a hit in its video release, bringing Sasaki, then 31, late-comer stardom in the pink profession. In N≈çpan Amadera: Ureta Shigemi (1998) Sasaki actually shaved her head for the role of a teacher who becomes a Buddhist nun.http://actress.dmm.co.jp/en/-/product/=/link_id=173sne069/ . Retrieved July 2018. The main feature of the December 2000 issue of P*G magazine was an interview with Sasaki on the fourth anniversary of her pink film debut. Since 1994 P*G has been the leading journal on the pink film, and is the host of the Pink Grand Prix, the major awards ceremony for the genre.

It previously served as a custom house and a courthouse for the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. It continues to serve as a post office. Building history Founded on the Rio Grande by a Spanish settler in 1755, the city of Laredo became part of Mexico in 1821. In 1840, Laredo was named capital of the Republic of the Rio Grande during a rebellion that Mexico soon quashed. Laredo's allegiance remained with Mexico until 1845, when the United States annexed Texas and the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War subsequently began. In 1848, under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the two governments established the Rio Grande as the boundary between the United States and Mexico, making Laredo part of the United States. The following year, postal service in Laredo began. During the late-19th century, Laredo entered a period of economic prosperity stimulated by the railroad, coal mining, and irrigated farming. The population tripled, and with this growth came a demand for government services. As Laredo became known as the gateway to Mexico, the federal government began preparations to construct a new post office, courthouse, and custom house. James Knox Taylor, Supervising Architect of the Treasury, designed the Neoclassical-style building. Early plans included an eight-foot-high wall that would have surrounded the building. After the public protested this restrictive component of the design, Taylor removed it. Groundbreaking commenced in 1905 and employees occupied the building, which cost $650,000 to construct, in 1907. In 1935, the Office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury, then overseen by Louis A. Simon, designed an addition to the building to accommodate the growing space needs. The addition doubled the size of the building, which now occupies an entire city block. In 1962, the customs service vacated the building. In 2004, a new federal courthouse was built to accommodate District and Magistrate court functions. The historic building continues to serve as a post office and federal courthouse, and contains office space for the U.S. Department of Justice. The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2001 for its historical and architectural significance. Architecture The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse, a significant local landmark in Laredo, is an excellent example of the Neoclassical style of architecture. It is located at 1300 Matamoros in downtown Laredo, two blocks from City Hall and the Webb County Courthouse. The building displays many character-defining features of the Neoclassical style, which was commonly used in federal building design during the early-20th century because it conveyed a strong and dignified governmental presence. Constructed predominantly of limestone on the exterior, the building also employs high-quality materials such as terrazzo and marble on the interior. The street level of the south-facing, symmetrical facade is dominated by a series of round-arched openings that together form an arcade. Scrolled keystones top each arch. The rusticated limestone on the first story distinguishes the ground level from the smooth upper floors. On the second story, the area beneath a prominent central portico features three arched doorways separated by pilasters. The doorways are slightly recessed and are surrounded by decorative molding and surmounted with ornate carvings. Each carving includes an articulated keystone beneath an oval medallion crowned with a shell motif called a coquillage. Cornucopias of fruit and leaves flank the medallion. A dentil course tops each doorway. Large multi-pane tripartite windows occupy the third story. At the eastern and western ends of the facade, glazed, multi-pane doors on the second story have segmental arched openings with articulated surrounds and keystones. The doorways lead to small balconets that feature scrolled, cast iron railings. Windows on the third story are rectangular and feature surrounds similar to those on the second-story doors. The projecting central portion of the upper stories contains a classical portico with a pediment supported by four, two-story Roman Doric order columns. The frieze contains triglyphs, incised patterns commonly paired with Doric columns, which alternate with paterae, circular medallions that occupy the spaces in the frieze called metopes. The tympanum, or triangular area of the pediment, contains a single, large, centrally placed patera that is flanked with a foliated pattern. Mutule blocks, another Doric detail, line the tympanum. Delicate cast-iron railings occupy the spaces between the columns. While the remaining elevations of the building are less ornate, they contain many classical features, including the incised first story and arched openings. The dignified appearance of the exterior is carried through the interior. The postal lobby, which remains in use, has terrazzo floors. Plaster walls are decorated with marble baseboards and wainscoting and iron grilles featuring a square-and-x motif are located above postal boxes on some walls. The plaster ceiling is crowned by a molded cornice with dentils. The elevator lobby also features terrazzo flooring and decorative cast-iron elevator enclosures. A marble staircase that connects the second and third levels has a scrolled, cast-iron balustrade that terminates in a floral-motif pilaster. The postal workroom remains in its original location at the center of the postal lobby corridors. The original walls, piers, and columns are clad in vertical wood wainscot with wood cap and base moldings on the lower portions with plaster above. However, the space has been altered to accommodate public service counters and additional postal boxes. The courtrooms have been altered over time. The second-story courtroom was previously partitioned for office space, but converted back to a single room in 1972, although neither the furniture nor the finishes were restored. The third-floor courtroom retains its original plan. The cornice, doors, windows, radiator enclosures, and bench remain, although other original finishes have been removed or covered.

Building history The U.S. Custom House occupies an entire block in the central business district of Houston, Texas. It was built as a post office and courthouse between 1907 and 1911 and later converted to use as the custom house. During this period, urban post offices often shared a building with courts and other federal offices. Houston competed unsuccessfully with Galveston during the latter portion of the 19th century, until the 1900 hurricane, the deadliest natural disaster in United States history, devastated Galveston. The risk to businesses, particularly shipping, caused many companies to move their facilities to the safer, sheltered port of Houston. By 1910, seventeen railroads moved passengers and freight to and from Houston. As Houston grew, the demand for postal facilities and other federal services increased and a new building to house them was needed. The Supervising Architect of the Treasury James Knox Taylor designed the building in the Second Renaissance Revival style. Federal buildings constructed during this era used classical revival styles almost exclusively. Taylor's philosophy was that public buildings should be pleasant to look at, convey dignity appropriate to the federal government, and that they should be designed to permit a utilitarian interior arrangement. Construction began in 1907, and on December 1, 1911, thousands of Houstonians came to tour the building during its grand opening celebration. The building was originally constructed to house the federal district court, a post office, and other federal offices. The increasing number of federal offices in Houston necessitated the 1931 addition. The courthouse operated in the building until 1962, the same year that the post office vacated a portion of the space originally allocated to it. Renovation of those spaces prepared them for other uses. The building has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places since 1974. When this building was constructed, it was the only monumental Second Renaissance Revival building in Houston and one of the larger downtown buildings. It replaced a three-story polychromatic Moorish post office built in 1889, which had been unlike any other building in Houston at the time. Today, especially to the south, this building is surrounded by modern skyscrapers. Architecture The U.S. Custom House in Houston occupies the city block bounded by San Jacinto, Carolina, Capital, and Rusk streets, with the facade facing northwest onto San Jacinto Street. It is a well-executed example of the Second Renaissance Revival architectural style, as evident in the arched first-story windows, rusticated stonework with deep joints, emphasis on the horizontal plane, and the stately appearance of the building. The classical origins of the style are manifested in the symmetry of the building and the shapes and motifs used to embellish both the exterior and interior. The main portion of the building has three stories with a full basement and the wings have four stories. The building has a copper Mansard roof, and interior light wells flank the area that began as the two-story courtroom. Exterior cladding on the building is primarily granite, though a portion of the east elevation is clad in brick. The horizontal rustication of the first floor, entry bays, and quoins is characteristic of the architectural style. There are eleven bays in the main, or west, elevation. The T-shaped building has single-story wings on either side of the base of the T. These wings, and the wings that create the T shape, are all part of the 1931 addition. The addition omitted the first floor rustication, but is otherwise consistent with the architectural style of the original building. Each of the first floor windows and the doors are arched. There are belt courses between the first and second stories, and above the third-story windows. An elaborate entablature, including a dentil molding, cornice, medallions, and a simple frieze, encircles the building, topped by a decorative parapet that includes both a pedestal and balustrade. The main entry doors are in the west elevation, in the second and tenth bays. Stone steps provide access to the entrances, each of which is flanked by freestanding ornamental metal lampposts. Each entrance projects outward from the vertical surface of the building. Above each door is a pair of ionic order columns joined by a decorative balustrade. Between each of the two pairs of columns are two windows separated by an oval cartouche. A triangular pediment with an eagle signifies that this is a federal building. Floral designs within the triangle top each of these entries. Constructed as a post office and courthouse, the building originally included postal facilities on the first floor, offices around the perimeter of the upper floors, and a central two- story courtroom. The south and west corridors on the first floor both retain their original terrazzo and gray marble floors. The lobby features terrazzo floors, marble baseboards, tongue and groove wood paneling, and plasterwork above the windows and on the beams with raised gold-painted laurel wreaths and geometric patterns. The current post office occupies only a portion of the space originally designed for it. The wood floor and vaults are original, as are some doors and windows leading to internal corridors. The second and third floor hallways retain their terrazzo and marble flooring. When use of the building as a courthouse ceased, the courtroom was converted into offices. Offices and other internal spaces were modified as their uses changed.

Located at 507 25th Street, it is listed as a Historic Federal Building (GSA Building #: UT0010ZZ), and was constructed during the years 1933-1934\\\\. Its primary task was to provide offices for the U.S. Forest Service Intermountain Region, the Experimental Station, and the Supply Depot. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Significance The Ogden architectural firm of Hodgson & McClenahan began the project in 1932, while construction began in 1933. Murch Brothers Construction, of St. Louis, Missouri, finished construction in 1934. The Forest Service Building was one of the first buildings built under the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Its construction was a result of the government's desire to stimulate growth during the Great Depression. As the earliest Federal building in Ogden, it paved a way for what has become the largest employer in Ogden. The building is a fine example of the Art Deco building style. This style incorporates detailed decorative surfaces that include stepped silhouettes and geometric detailing. It is one of three buildings in Ogden that adhere to this style, all of which are included in a National Register Thematic Nomination \\"Ogden Art Deco Buildings.\\" The State of Utah placed a historical marker in the main lobby to acknowledge this significance. The offices of the U.S. Forest Service have remained operational to the present day. The Internal Revenue Service and the USDA Office of General Counsel also share offices in the building. Because of the unique nature of the building, it has become a well-known landmark. Few modifications have been made to the building and it has been well maintained over the years. Building history In 1908, the U.S. Forest Service selected the city of Ogden as the location for its district headquarters. Ogden was chosen over Salt Lake City because it had more favorable railroad rates, more local amenities, and a stronger business community. Design and construction work on the headquarters building did not begin until the 1930s. The building, located on the southeast corner of the inter-section of Twenty-fifth Street and Adams Avenue, was one of the first in the nation to be funded by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). The WPA was the largest agency of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal program, which was designed to stimulate the economy during the Great Depression. Federal officials awarded the design contract to the local architectural firm of Hodgson & McClenahan. Working under the supervision of federal construction engineer Clement J. Gerber and Acting Supervising Architect of the Treasury James A. Wetmore, Leslie Hodgson developed design concept sketches and partner Myrl McClenahan produced working drawings. Both men were noted for their perfectionism and concern with detail. The resulting building is an innovative example of the Art Deco style of architecture, which Hodgson & McClenahan popularized in Ogden. In late 1932, Murch Brothers Construction Company of St. Louis, Missouri, received the contract to construct the building and on-site work began in January 1933. The building quickly became a local landmark, due in large part to its remarkable appearance in a largely residential area. In addition to its architectural merit, the building helped to establish Ogden as an important center of federal activity. Since its construction, only minimal alterations have been made to the building, resulting in a very high level of architectural integrity. Original storage areas were renovated into offices between 1939 and 1940, and roofing was replaced and skylights removed in 1963. The U.S. Forest Service Building was first listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 as part of the Ogden Art Deco Buildings Thematic Resources Nomination, which recognizes the town's significant Art Deco architecture. In 2006, the building was individually listed in the National Register. The U.S. Forest Service continues to utilize the building to house its Ogden Ranger District, Office of General Counsel, and Intermountain Research Station staff. Architecture The building is a skillfully executed example of the Art Deco style of architecture, which features a Modern appeal, vertical emphasis, and stylized ornamentation. Distinctive stepped, linear forms and silhouettes recur in components of the building, as do Art-Deco motifs such as chevrons, sunbursts, and zigzags. The four-story building is clad in brick that is darker tan in color at the base and gradually transitions to lighter tones of beige at the upper stories. In order to achieve the desired color gradation, the architects employed eight shades of brick and were actively involved in the placement of the masonry. The mortar and terra-cotta detailing match the brickwork and enhance the progressive shading. The building has a rectangular footprint at the basement and first story levels. The second through fourth stories are constructed within a U-shaped light court to allow natural illumination of the interior. The reinforced-concrete frame structure is enclosed in a brick and terra-cotta curtain wall and rests on a grey granite foundation made of blocks from the Raymond Granite quarry in California. A terra-cotta water table with a matching gray glaze tops the foundation. The first and second stories are visually separated by a terra-cotta stringcourse with geometric and floral patterns. The symmetrical facade, which faces Twenty-fifth Street, has slightly recessed bays at either end. The facade is dominated by regularly spaced windows with aluminum mullions. Tall brick pilasters emphasize the building's verticality. The window openings are topped by terra-cotta spandrels with sharply molded projecting vertical apexes. The spandrels also feature zigzag motifs and stylized foliated decorations. The flat roof contains a centrally placed three-story penthouse tower with a glass-topped greenhouse used for agency studies and experiments. The penthouse is executed with the linear stepped pattern and features terra-cotta trim with chevrons. A tall brick chimney, which displays the same skillful color gradation, is located at the southeast corner of the building. Access to the interior is gained through the main central entrance, which contains a recessed doorway articulated by a wide, incised surround. Above the doorway, a panel identifying the building as a U.S. Forest Service facility is flanked by two carved, stylized eagles. The service's insignia, which includes a tree superimposed on a shield, is located on each side of the panel. Two Art Deco street lamps with a stepped pattern flank the entrance and feature sunburst and chevron ornamentation. The main entry doors are glass with etched nickel- bronze frames and handles with a stepped, rectilinear arrangement. The interior spaces are richly ornamented, a typical feature of the Art Deco style. The vestibule and main lobby are identically detailed. Utah Golden Travise marble covers the walls and Verde Antique marble forms the baseboard. The walls are topped with an elaborate cast-plaster crown molding that is an Art-Deco interpretation of the traditional egg-and-dart motif. A metallic silver glaze covers the molding. The cornices replicate the stepped pattern found throughout the building. Centrally placed silver foil appliques adorn the ceilings. The central staircase, which is accessed from the lobby through an arched opening with stepped, rectilinear forms, is clad in the same marble found in the lobby and has wood handrails with octagonal cross sections. Similar arched openings lead from the lobby to the east and west corridors. The walls of the corridors retain the original wood wainscot cap with the ubiquitous stepped profile. While sections of flooring have been replaced or covered, select areas retain original rubber tiles that were laid in a tri- color diamond pattern.

Pickett U.S. Custom House is a historic custom house building located at Norfolk, Virginia Building history Located near the waterfront in downtown Norfolk, the Owen B. Pickett U.S. Custom House is a testimony to the importance of commerce and trade in the city. The activities of the Norfolk Customs Service, one of the inaugural Customs offices in the nation, were initially located in various rented quarters until an official U.S. Custom House was completed in 1819. As early as 1850 plans were developed to replace the first U.S. Custom House with a larger building that could also be used to accommodate the main U.S. Post Office. The history of Norfolk's present U.S. Custom House began when the U.S. Congress authorized funds for the construction of the building in 1850. A prominent site in downtown Norfolk at Main and Granby Streets was purchased in 1852 for $13,500. Supervising Architect of the Treasury Ammi B. Young (1798‚Äì1874) produced a design based on precepts of classical Roman architecture. Historians of the period anticipated that when completed, the U.S. Custom House \\"was to be one of the most imposing and showy buildings in the city.\\" Construction began in 1853 with John H. Sale serving as construction superintendent for the U.S. Treasury Department. The Post Office moved into its new quarters in 1857, though the building was only partially finished. The cost of the building upon completion in 1858 was reported to have reached $204,000, almost twice the original estimate. With the exception of a brief period of Confederate occupation (April 1861 to May 1862), this building has housed the U.S. Customs Service for over 135 years. The impressive Roman Temple form and the continued presence of the Customs Service in this building are constant reminders of the city's long and vital history in the pursuit of world trade. In 1970 the U.S. Custom House in Norfolk was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In 2001, the building received a Norfolk Design Award and was renamed in honor of U.S. Representative Owen B. Pickett of Virginia. Architecture The Owen B. Pickett U.S. Custom House is one of the last examples of a federal building using the Roman temple form. Monumental in scale, the rectangular block stands three stories in height. It is constructed of granite from Blue Hill, Maine, rusticated at the ground floor with smooth ashlar on the upper two floors. U.S. Custom House The primary facade of the building displays the high-style characteristics of Roman architecture with sweeping steps leading to the pedimented portico. The two-story portico, capped by an enclosed pediment with modillions, is composed of six full-height, fluted granite columns, each capped by cast-iron capitals designed in the Corinthian order. Centered under the projecting portico is a pair of entrance doors flanked by elongated windows embellished with granite surrounds. Single-leaf entry doors at the corners of the ground floor were originally designed as separate male and female entrances to the Post Office lobby. Window openings, placed between the strong vertical forms of the Corinthian pilasters, pierce the symmetrically fenestrated side elevations of the building. The openings are embellished with molded granite surrounds, pedimented lintels, flat arches, and bracketed sills. The building is richly adorned by a classically inspired cast-iron entablature with frieze, modillions, and molded cornice. Cast-iron columns, girders, and beams form the interior structural system of the U.S. Custom House. Brick arches support the spaces between the girders. Square columns are integrated with wood stud partitions and finished with plaster. Cast-iron- detailed capitals are ornamented with a simplified leaf motif derived from the Corinthian order modified to incorporate the Virginia tobacco leaf as a prominent feature. A ten-foot-wide corridor with original ceramic tile flooring begins at the main entrance and runs the entire length of the building, terminating at the main stair at the south end. The cast-iron circular stair with ornamental open risers has a wrought-iron balustrade and mahogany handrail. On October 22, 1858, The Southern Argus reported that the nearly completed U.S. Custom House was designed with \\"large, airy [rooms], admirably planned and furnished with a view to good taste and convenience; indeed the arrangements are all in accordance with a superior plan, and the workmanship is faithfully executed.\\" Offices flank the main corridors of both the first and second floors. Original features extant throughout the Custom House include marble tile flooring in the corridors, plaster walls, vaulted ceilings, fireplaces, and wood flooring in the offices. Since the completion of the U.S. Custom House in 1858, various alterations have been made. Between 1901 and 1912, the Office of the Supervising Architect under James Knox Taylor oversaw alterations including the installation of new double-hung wood sash windows. A single-story addition at the rear of the building, constructed in 1935 under the direction of the Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore, continues the original design in style, scale, and finish. The rusticated limestone masonry of the addition continues the coursing and rhythm of the original building, although the interiors are more modest in detailing. The custom house was closed between 1996 and 2000 for a renovation project costing $3 million.

It is a courthouse for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Building history When Milwaukee's Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse was constructed in 1892-99, it epitomized the revolutionized mail handling that had followed the introduction of postal stamps in 1847. By the end of the 19th century, added postal services included registered mail, street letter boxes, and free mail delivery. When an existing, 1859 post office became inadequate for the postal service's growing needs, Congress was persuaded to fund a new, larger building in 1889. It included multiple federal agencies under one roof‚Äîhousing the U.S. Postal Service, Courts and Customs Service. Today, the District Courts are the only original tenant remaining in the building. The massive granite edifice is a city landmark within the historic district known as Juneautown and the first ward organized from land owned by Solomon Juneau, Milwaukee's founder and first mayor. The building is surrounded by notable and contemporaneous historic buildings, including the Milwaukee Club (1883), The Pfister Hotel (1893), and the Northwestern National Insurance Building (1906). The Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse's imposing Richardsonian Romanesque architecture presented a break from the classical style that dominated Government buildings for most of the 19th century. Designed by Willoughby J. Edbrooke, Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury Department, the style was popularized by renowned architect Henry Hobson Richardson, whose use of the Romanesque Revival began to penetrate the Midwest during the 1880s. Edbrooke's predecessor, James G. Hill, supervising architect during the late nineteenth century, was the first federal architect to abandon classical forms. Under Hill's influence, federal structures often featured lofty towers that were visible from long distances during the period when few buildings rose above ten stories. From 1929-32, construction of a large addition extended the building southward. The addition was raised to seven stories eight years later. In 1989 -96, GSA completed a major renovation and restoration project, which restored the historic interiors to their original brilliance while incorporating modern office needs. In 1972, the building was designated a Milwaukee City Landmark, and in 1973, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Architecture Milwaukee's Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse is a five-story structure, sturdy and picturesque, handsomely detailed, and admirably maintained. Filling the entire city block bound by Michigan, Jackson, and Jefferson Streets, with its facade facing Wisconsin Avenue on the north, the building is an excellent example of Romanesque Revival architecture, featuring a robust display of stone massing and heavy Roman arches. Walls of dark- and light-gray Mount Waldo granite rise to a steeply pitched hipped roof pierced by a variety of gabled projections. A soaring tower framed by pinnacles rises from the center of the facade, terminating in an arcaded belfry and a high pyramidal roof. The facade is broken into recesses and projections, creating a dynamic composition punctuated by an arcaded entrance on the first level and Roman arches over the second- and third-story fenestration. Massive stone forms are relieved with fine decoration. The first story provides the greatest display of Romanesque ornament, featuring highly carved moldings and decorative stonework surrounding the main entrance. The building's corners are rounded by tall pinnacles with alternating bands of smooth and textured stone and are capped by conical roofs with layered trim. The upper-story walls are smooth, accented with thin, textured stringcourses, rising to gabled dormers that incorporate Romanesque leaf ornament, gargoyles, and finials. Like the facade, the east and west elevations are ornamented and symmetrically balanced, prominently featuring a projecting gable with a variety of arched fenestration. The 1929-32 addition to the south adds a massive eight-story block at the rear of the original structure. Although its walls are clad in granite and include arched fenestration to match the original building, the extension is distinguished by its flat roof, flattened elevations, and reduced ornamentation. Interior spaces on the first through fifth floors are arranged about a vast central atrium capped by an iron-and-glass skylight. The illuminated space was originally an open light well and is now used for many public events. Within the atrium's large volume, columns, marble wainscoting, oak crown molding, stenciled designs, and plaster ceiling moldings have been restored to their original finishes and colors. Although the first story's original ceiling was removed to open the room to the light well above, its steel structural members were retained to recall the room's original configuration as the postal workspace. The building's corridors, stair halls, and lobbies are adorned with multicolored marble mosaics, oak paneling, and decorative plaster ceilings. The interiors of the 1929-32 addition match the materials and colors used in 1899, harmonizing with the original interior design. The two-story historic U.S. District Courtroom, located on the third floor, is richly detailed with carved oak paneling and trim on the walls and ceiling. Historic paint finishes have been carefully conserved to their original hue. Fine Romanesque detailing embellishes the arches over the doors, windows, and the judge's bench. Centered between the two doorways is the room's original ladies' balcony, entirely finished in oak. A massive seven- year restoration project begun in 1989 revived the building to its original condition. The work involved extensive materials research to determine original paint colors and decorative patterns for the walls and ceilings, including the original hand-painted-and-stenciled designs in a trompe-l'≈ìil effect (an artistic illusion of realism). Interior finishes and fixtures were restored, while the exterior stone and brickwork was conserved and repaired. Renovations created more comfortable work spaces and energy-efficient HVAC systems. Through the effort of many collaborators, the building remains one of the most venerable displays of architecture in the Milwaukee area.

Accessed: September 28, 2015. John Stepan Zamecnik (May 14, 1872 in Cleveland, Ohio - June 13, 1953 in Los Angeles, California) was an American composer and conductor. He is best known for the \\"photoplay music\\" he composed for use during silent films by pianists, organists, and orchestras. Zamecnik used many pseudonyms, including Dorothy Lee, Lionel Baxter, R.L. (Robert) Creighton, Arturo de Castro, \\"Josh and Ted\\", J. (Jane) Hathaway, Kathryn Hawthorne, Roberta Hudson, Ioane Kawelo, J. Edgar Lowell, Jules Reynard, F. (Frederick) Van Norman, Hal Vinton and Grant Wellesley.  Early Life  John Zamecnik was born in Cleveland to Czech immigrants Josef Z√°meƒçn√≠k (1832-1915) and Kate≈ôina Hrubeck√° (1838-1908). Josef was born in Budiƒçovice and Kate≈ôina was born in the nearby Sk√°ly. The couple married in He≈ôma≈à in 1862. Josef's brother Jan later married Kate≈ôina's sister Konstancie in the same place in 1869. Both couples immigrated to Ohio bringing Josef's daughters and perhaps other relatives. Jan's grandson was the geneticist Paul Zamecnik.  Career  Zamecnik studied at the Prague Conservatory of Music under Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k in the mid-1890s, completing his classes there in 1897. In 1899 Zamecnik finally returned to the United States. While living in Cleveland, where he worked as a violinist and composer, he also played in the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra as a violinist under Victor Herbert. In 1907, Zamecnik became music director of the newly constructed Hippodrome Theater in Cleveland, Ohio. When the Hippodrome commenced with the screening of silent films, Zamecnik began to compose music scores for them. They were published by Samuel Fox,Mont Alto: Composer Profile: J.S. Zamecnik (1872-1953);www.mont- alto.com whose company was the first to publish original film scores in the United States.\\"Sam Fox, 89, Dies; Music Publisher\\"; New York Times; Dec. 1, 1971. Fox published the Zamecnik-composed Sam Fox Moving Picture Music volumes, consisting of incidental music and leitmotifs such as \\"Mysterious Burglar Music\\", intended for when a burglar is on screen. Jack Shaindlin, music director of Movietone News in New York City, adapted the first theme of Zamecnik's popular circus march World Events (1935) for the Main and End Title theme of Movietone Newsreels. Jackie Gleason's American Scene Magazine television series in the 1950s used this version to open a skit that parodied current events. In 2011 Paramount Pictures secured the original manuscript score of the cues composed by Zamecnik for Wings from the Library of Congress. A new recording was produced for the 24 January 2012 launch of the Wings DVD and Blu-ray.

Weis, Jr. U.S. Courthouse is a Beaux Arts style building located at 700 Grant Street, Pittsburgh in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. It is a courthouse of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Building history As the steel industry boomed in Pittsburgh during the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the population of the city grew. New residents required federal services, so Pittsburgh native and Secretary of the Treasury Andrew W. Mellon helped to allocate funds for a new federal building in his hometown. Mellon supported the construction of a building that would represent the rise of Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania to national political and economic prominence. The New York architectural firm of Trowbridge & Livingston designed the building under the auspices of Supervising Architect of the Treasury James A. Wetmore. Construction commenced in 1931 but stopped shortly thereafter due to a labor dispute. The strike ended and construction resumed on June 8, 1932. The building was erected over the rail line in order to eliminate transporting mail to and from stations. It was completed and opened to the public on October 13, 1934 amid much fanfare, as was typical for federal building dedications during the Depression era, when federal buildings were symbols of hope for economic recovery and social stability. The Western District of Pennsylvania gaveled in its first court session in the building on November 7, 1934. Referred to as the New Federal Building until 1964, when another federal building was built across the street, it was the city's main postal distribution center until the majority of postal functions moved to a new facility in 1983. General Services Administration (GSA) acquired the building the following year. During the 20th century, the building underwent several significant interior alterations, which included the addition of new courtrooms and the removal of the train tracks. Renovations that began in 2002 involved the modernization of existing courtrooms and the installation of six new courtrooms and judge's chambers to accommodate the growing needs of the courts. Lobby spaces were restored, and the building's exterior was cleaned and re-pointed. The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse is a contributing building in the Pittsburgh Central Downtown Historic District, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Ten years later, the building was individually listed in the National Register of Historic Places as the US Post Office and Courthouse- Pittsburgh. The renovation design received a citation at the 2001 GSA Design Awards Ceremony. In 2015, the building was renamed for Joseph F. Weis Jr., a judge in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. The Grant Street Station Post Office, which had been in the Seventh Avenue section of the building since its opening, closed permanently at 2:00 p.m. EST on Saturday Afternoon, February 15, 2014. Glenn A. Walsh, who had leased a post office box in this Post Office for more than 25 years, was the last member of the general public in the Post Office at the time of closing. Architecture The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse occupies the entire block bounded by Seventh and Grant streets and the Pennsylvania Railroad. The most significant exterior elevation faces Grant Street and contains the primary entrance to the courtrooms and offices. A Monument Reborn: U.S. Post Office & Courthouse, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvaniavideo, 15 min. 29 secs., U.S. General Services Administration, 2007 The building was designed in the Stripped Classical style of architecture, which was commonly used for government buildings during the late 1920s and early 1930s. It is a refined style that conveys the dignity and stability of the federal government, which was particularly important during the Great Depression. It does not, however, contain excessive or exuberant ornamentation that was deemed inappropriate for a somber period in American history. It was one of the last classically inspired buildings to be constructed in Pittsburgh before Moderne architecture became popular. The building contains two distinct masses. The first mass is four stories in height and originally housed the postal facilities. The second mass is set back slightly and includes the fifth through eleventh floors, which contain courtrooms, jury rooms, judge's chambers, and other offices. The Post Office and Courthouse has a steel frame clad in granite on the lower levels, while the upper stories are faced in limestone. The lower portion of the building is covered in rusticated blocks that provide an appropriate foundation for the tall arched window and door openings that dominate each elevation. Massive carved limestone eagles above the entrances convey the federal importance of the building. The upper stories feature pilasters (attached columns) topped with circular medallions. Grant Street entrance High-quality metals such as bronze and aluminum, which were commonly incorporated in federal buildings constructed during this era, were used on doors, window frames, window sash, and grilles. These original features remain in place throughout the building. The building has undergone several renovations and alterations to its interior. In the 1960s and 1970s, before the post office vacated the site, original finishes in some portions of the interior were covered or removed. Some office spaces were finished with modern materials and part of the main post office area was sheathed in drywall in 1975. However, many public spaces remain intact. The south lobby at Grant Street is two stories. Walls are covered with pink Alabama marble and a marble dentil course encircles the room. Floors are covered with gray marble, while decorative coffered plaster ceilings top the space. Mouldings surrounding the bronze and glass doors contain ornate rope and garland designs. Original custom glass light fixtures remain in the lobby. Other important public spaces include stair and elevator lobbies and corridors. Walls are generally clad in marble wainscot, and floors are covered in terrazzo. The plaster ceilings are less ornate than those found in the ground-floor lobby. Staircases have original brass handrails. The first floor contains an elaborate groin vaulted, terra cotta ceiling with gold-leaf trim, now visible from the main lobby. The original courtrooms are among the most notable interior spaces in any historic public building in Pittsburgh. Five ceremonial courtrooms are located on the sixth and eighth floors. Each courtroom is two stories in height with wood- panel walls, decorative plaster ceilings, and ornamental lighting. During the Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt stimulated the economy through public works and other government expenditures. Three murals were commissioned for the courtrooms under the Section of Planning & Sculpture and installed in 1936 and 1937: Steel Industry by Howard Norton Cook; Pittsburgh Panorama by Stuyvesant Van Veen; and Modern Justice by Kindred McLeary. A 1972 survey found that Modern Justice had been removed. It remains lost today. The 2002 to 2006 modifications include glazed additions to house new courtrooms within the existing light courts. GSA commissioned Brian Shure and Lia Cook to create new works of art. Shure's three murals depict contemporary Pittsburgh from a variety of vantage points. Cook's work, a textile painting depicting images of children, combines hand weaving techniques with computer technology.

Dyer Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse, formerly known simply as the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse, is an historic United States Post Office and federal courthouse of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida located at 300 Northeast 1st Avenue in Miami, Florida. Built in 1931 of limestone, it is the largest such structure in South Florida.David W. Dyer Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse , General Services Administration]. The building was listed in the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1983. In 1997, it was renamed to honor David W. Dyer, a former Chief Judge of the Southern District who was appointed to the circuit court in 1966. Building history Courthouse in 1933 In 1887, railroad and real estate tycoon Henry Flagler hired the renowned New York architectural firm of Carrere & Hastings to design the Ponce de Leon Hotel in St. Augustine, Florida. The hotel's Mediterranean Revival design was so successful that it influenced numerous Florida architects and became the principal aesthetic in the Miami area from the mid-1910s into the 1930s. In 1926, a devastating hurricane decimated southern Florida, prompting Congress to appropriate more than $2 million for a new courthouse in Miami in 1928. The Office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury selected the highly regarded architectural partnership of Phineas Paist and Harold D. Steward. In the 1920s, Paist had been one of primary architects for developer George E. Merrick, for the Miami suburb of Coral Gables. Designing the building between 1930 and 1931, Paist and Steward blended classically inspired Renaissance Revival forms and design elements with Mediterranean ornamentation. Paist and Steward developed two sets of plans, each to be built upon a poured concrete and steel structural frame, ensuring the new federal building would resist hurricane-force winds. The first envisioned using imported marble and bronze, while the second was to use aluminum and a local coralline limestone, a lithified coral quarried at Windley Key near Key Largo and called Keystone. The government opted to clad the building in Keystone, reasoning that local materials added to the regional appeal of the building. Construction commenced in 1931 and the opening ceremony was held on July 1, 1933. It remains the most monumental Keystone structure in South Florida. When it opened, the building housed all Miami-area federal agencies with the exception of the Weather Service. The U.S. Postal Service vacated the building in 1976. It was occupied by federal courts and various federal agencies until 2008. It is contained within Federal Courthouse Square, a two-block area that includes two other courthouses. On May 12, 2016, neighboring Miami Dade College signed a $1 a year, 115-year lease of the building for use as class rooms and lecture halls.http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami- dade/article77050342.html Architecture Sculpture in front of the courthouse The building is an example of Mediterranean Revival architecture that combines Renaissance Revival elements with regional Florida architectural features. The building, which is faced in Keystone, is three stories in height, with the third story set above a widely projecting entablature on the north, east, and south elevations. The facade, which has a slightly projecting central bay, faces east onto First Avenue and is dominated by a colonnade composed of regularly spaced engaged Corinthian columns supporting the classical entablature crowning the second story. Cast-aluminum casement window frames have embossed repeating chevron patterns. Spandrel panels depicting scenes from Florida's history are above the second story's arched windows. The bays adjoining the colonnade feature paired Corinthian pilasters. Bas relief medallions containing classical figures in profile decorate lintels. The central parapet features a carved marble frieze incorporating a large eagle, flanked by a repeating motif of pelicans supporting heraldic shields. The entrances at the ends of the facade have surrounds of carved Floridene buff marble. The north and south elevations feature two-story Corinthian pilasters evoking the facade's colonnade. Ornate mascarons (carved faces) are found on the building's exterior. The north and south elevations are dominated by central pavilions with bays separated by evenly spaced two-story engaged columns, placed singly and in pairs. An annex is attached to the west elevation. The building's shallow hipped roof is covered with terra-cotta tiles, typical of the Mediterranean Revival style. Interior spaces are equally elaborate and incorporate eleven different types of marble. Entry vestibules with arched openings lead to the main lobby, where marble covers floors and forms wainscot. Marble pilasters have striking gilt capitals. An inset, multi- colored marble star pattern adorns the center of the floor. Original aluminum and glass chandeliers hang from the painted and gilt wood-and-plaster coffered ceiling. Marble postal tables retain original lamps and inset cast-brass grilles. The double-height ceremonial District Courtroom is another significant space with well-preserved original details, including the carved wooden judge's bench, jury box, witness stand, and clerk's desk. Decorative details include fluted pilasters, rosettes, and carved plaques with floral rinceaux. At the walls, seven feet of paneled wood wainscot is located beneath scored plaster. Marble Ionic pilasters divide the window openings. The mural Law Guides Florida Progress completed by artist Denman Fink in 1941 is located above the judge's bench and is flanked by two pairs of Ionic marble pilasters. The mural depicts the positive impact of justice guiding Florida's economic development. Fink included a likeness of himself as a draftsman and a likeness of architect Phineas E. Paist, with whom he worked in Coral Gables, as a chemist. The coffered ceiling features rosettes, stars, and shells. Other significant artwork in the courthouse includes two striking cast-stone lunettes by Yugoslav-born American artist Alexander Sambugnac. Executed in 1938, the low-relief panels portray two allegorical figures representing themes of the spirit of justice and are placed on the lintels above the leather-covered doors. Love and Hope shows a young woman playing the lyre, while Wisdom and Courage depicts a seated figure gazing at a tablet of the law. The interior brick courtyard admits light into the building while also providing a beautiful outdoor space commonly found in Florida architecture. A two-story loggia with a vaulted ceiling and columns surrounds the courtyard on three sides. Keystone pilasters support arched lunette windows above the public lobby's paired French doors. Quoins (corner blocks) and Doric columns add decorative elements to the space. The courtyard's interior walls are unplastered brick, as are the exterior walls that face toward the courtyard from the north, east and south wings. The loggia's plaster walls and ceiling are ornamented with the multi-colored Frescoes in Courtyard, added by artist David Novros in 1984. An original postal marble writing table with an elaborate pedestal occupies the west side of the courtyard.

He is an 15-time Mexican League All-Star and played with the Campeche Pirates for more than 20 seasons. He was born in Guaymas, Sonora. Career The top pitcher in the Mexican League in the early part of the 21st century, Francisco Campos was first signed by the Houston Astros in 1991 as a catcher. He only hit .147/~.275/.235 in 21 games for the GCL Astros. He missed the entire 1992 season with injuries and most of 1993. He moved to the Campeche Pirates in 1993 and batted .148/~.200/.174. After batting .278/.381/.333 in 19 games in 1994, he was converted to pitching. In 1995, Campos had a 1.93 ERA in 5 outings, then became a regular starter in '96 and styled a 10-3 record and 2.49 ERA, 8th in the Liga. In 1997, the 24-year- old hurler had a 9-10, 2.92 record. He improved to 13-6, 2.88 in 1998 and almost doubled his strikeout total from 70 to 130. He was 10th in the LMB in ERA, tied for fifth in wins and second to Ravelo Manzanillo in strikeouts. In '99, Campos had an off-year (6-11, 3.71) and was 11-4, 3.10 in 2000 with 172 K in 189 innings. He was third in the Liga in ERA and second to Manzanillo in strikeouts. His 1.79 ERA in the 2000-01 Mexican Pacific League was second to Eleazar Mora and he followed with a 10-7, 3.19 year with Campeche. The 2001‚Äì2002 winter league season was another fine one as Campos went 5-2 with a 1.66 ERA, lowest in the LMP and he led with 89 Ks. In the LMB, he went 8-9, 3.45 in 2002 but was signed by the Milwaukee Brewers. Reporting to the Indianapolis Indians, he had a 3-0, 2.05 record in 4 appearances, allowing a .180 average and 14 K to 1 BB in 22 IP but did not get called up. He went 3-3 with a 2.25 ERA and a LMP-high 76 strikeouts in 2002‚Äì2003. That year, he was 6-4 with a 2.40 ERA for Campeche and only 2-4, 5.72 with Indianapolis. In the 2003 Pan American Games, Campos allowed a sacrifice fly to Paul Janish, scoring Seth Smith in the 14th inning of the semifinals as Mexico lost a tough game to the US and Huston Street. It knocked Mexico out of the Gold Medal game as they settled for Bronze. Campos began his best run in the 2003‚Äì2004 winter ball season. For the Mazatl√°n Deer, he was 10-2 with a 2.19 ERA and 68 strikeouts to take the LMP pitching Triple Crown and made Baseball America's winter league All-Star team. He pitched six scoreless innings in the 2004 Caribbean Series. Then, he went 12-2 with a 1.47 ERA and 99 K in 123 IP in the LMB season to take the pitching Triple Crown there as well, the first such winner in 48 years since Francisco Ramirez had done it. Campos's ERA was 1.22 lower than runner-up Osvaldo Fern√°ndez, he struck out 19 more than Leonardo Gonz√°lez and Jos√© Silva tied him for the win lead. He led Campeche to the pennant that year. Going to the Chicago White Sox system, he went 2-3 with a 4.26 ERA for the Charlotte Knights. After a 7-2, 3.29 year in winter ball, he helped Mexico to the 2005 Caribbean Series title by going 2-0, 1.13 with 23 K and 3 BB in 16 IP. He was again named to the Baseball America winter league All-Star team and won the deciding game in the Series. In the regular season, Francisco went 11-4 with a 2.84 ERA and 170 K in 152 innings. He led the Liga in Ks (73 more than runner-up Alonso Beltr√°n) and ERA (.41 lower than runner- up Eric Knott). He was picked to represent Mexico in the 2006 World Baseball Classic; manager Frank Estrada was criticized for not using him more, but he was the club's least effective pitcher with a 7.20 ERA, though he won his lone decision. Campos was shaky early in the 2006 season, failing to make the 2006 Mets out of spring training and going 6-5 with a 3.84 ERA for Campeche. In his 14th year there, he was dealt away to the Monterrey Sultans, where he went 5-0 with a 3.00 ERA for the Liga's top team, though they fell in the finals. In the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games, Francisco went 1-1 with an 8.10 ERA but Mexico still won a Bronze. Campos was 9-4 with a 3.08 ERA for Campeche in 2007 and finished 5th in the LMB in ERA. In the 2007 Pan-American Games, he got the no-decision in a Mexican win over Venezuela, then allowed just 2 runs to Team USA but got little support from a lineup with three major leaguers and many AAA veterans, losing a 2-1 decision. He was 0-1 with a 2.19 ERA for the Bronze Medal winners. Campos was 1-0 with a 3.48 ERA in the 2008 Final Olympic Qualification Tournament. In 10 innings, he struck out 22 and walked no one. He easily led in strikeouts, 6 ahead of Min-han Son and 12 ahead of anyone else. He got most of his K's in one game against the South African national team, whiffing 18 in 8 innings, allowing only two hits. Mexico failed to advance to the 2008 Olympics. In 2008, Francisco was 11-5 with a 2.41 ERA for Campeche, whiffing 115 and allowing 118 hits in 149 IP. He tied Felix Villegas for the league lead in strikeouts, tied for 4th in wins and second to Juan Delgadillo in ERA. In the 2008 Americas Baseball Cup, Campos was 1-1 with a 3.38 ERA and had the most balks (2) while being the worst of Mexico's 4 starters (the others were Walter Silva, Oscar Rivera and Pablo Ortega). Mexico still advanced to the 2009 Baseball World Cup. Campos's loss came by a 2-1 decision to Josu√© Matos and Puerto Rico. Campos went 0-1 in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, allowing 8 hits and 7 runs in 4 IP. He entered a game with Australia with a 7-4 lead and tossed two scoreless innings but gave up 3 runs in the 5th to tie the game. He then came into the game with Cuba ahead 2-1 in the third, replacing Pablo Ortega. He gave up a leadoff single to Rolando Meri√±o, who advanced on a ground out by Luis Miguel Navas and came home on a two-out single by Michel Enr√≠quez to tie the score. Mexico scored in the 4th but Cuba rallied in the bottom of the inning on a hit by Yosvani Peraza and homer by Yulieski Gourriel to take the lead for good. Campos took the loss. Campos has made 15 All-Star Game appearances throughout his time in the Mexican League, and was the starting pitcher in 5 of those games. He was also recently awarded the LMB's \\"Comeback Player of the Year\\" in 2016. On July 2, 2019, Campos recorded his 200th victory in a game against the Algodoneros de Uni√≥n Laguna and subsequently retired as an active player after achieving the feat. Only 14 other pitchers in the LMB have reached the same milestone. He thus finished his career in the Mexican League with a record of 200‚Äì148, a 3.35 ERA and 2,181 strikeouts across 3,038.1 innings pitched. Following his retirement, Campos was named manager of the Piratas de Campeche for the 2020 season.

Completed in 1940, it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2005. Its landmark designation was made because it was home to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the government arm that financed and oversaw the mobilization of the United States economy during World War II. It is currently home to the Export‚ÄìImport Bank of the United States and to offices of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Building history In 1938, the Lafayette Building Corporation was established with the purpose of constructing a building at Lafayette and Fifteenth streets in Washington, D.C. The corporation intended to privately develop the building that would then be leased to the federal government, making this an unusual speculative venture. The group retained the Chicago architectural firm Holabird & Root to design the building, which included some of the first uses of underground parking and central air-conditioning in the city. Holabird & Root invited a former employee, Washington architect A.R. Clas, to participate in key components of the design. Clas, who also worked for the federal government before starting his own firm, was likely critical in securing the commission. The architects selected the Stripped Classical style for the design of the Lafayette Building. The cornerstone was laid in 1939 and construction was completed a year later. Architectural Forum praised the design as a good example of \\"an observance of the classic formula with the elimination of accompanying detail.\\" While commercial enterprises occupied the street-level retail spaces, finance-related agencies leased the remaining portions of the building. Original tenants included the Federal Loan Agency, Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), RFC Mortgage Company, Disaster Loan Agency, Federal National Mortgage Authority, Export-Import Bank of Washington, and the Elective Home and Farm Authority, all established during the New Deal era. The building is significant for its historical association with both the Federal Loan Agency and the RFC, which were critical agencies involved in financing the mobilization of American industries during World War II. Jesse Holman Jones, who served as the chairman of the RFC until 1939 when he was appointed Federal Loan Administrator, maintained an office in the Lafayette Building, monitoring RFC activities even after he was appointed to the Cabinet as Secretary of Commerce in 1940, a position he retained until his retirement in 1945. Jones was called the second most important man in American government, after President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and the building is significant for its association with Jones's prominent career. In 1947, the federal government assumed ownership of the Lafayette Building. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark by the Secretary of the Interior in 2005. Architecture Although developed by a private corporation, the restrained exterior appearance of the Lafayette Building is typical of federal buildings erected during the Great Depression and World War II years, when government officials and architects agreed that elaborate ornamentation on public buildings represented unnecessary costs. Stripped Classical buildings feature little ornamentation and blend classical forms and high-quality materials from earlier eras with Modern design tenets. The Lafayette Building retains a high level of architectural integrity on both the interior and exterior, appearing much as it did upon its completion in 1940. The Lafayette Building is in a prominent location in Washington, D.C, facing both Lafayette Square and McPherson Square, one block from the White House. It occupies two-thirds of an irregularly shaped block bounded by Vermont Avenue and Fifteenth, I, and H streets and has an unusual footprint that is shaped like a lowercase E. The building is twelve stories in height, with the top two stories set back behind a terraced balcony. A granite retaining wall creates a narrow strip for plantings. The Lafayette Building's steel frame is encased with concrete and brick, collectively selected by the architects for their fireproof qualities. The first story of the building, which contains retail space, is clad in black granite, while the upper levels are faced with smooth light grey limestone on the street-front elevations. Less costly brick faces the alley and courtyard elevations. Regularly spaced square windows with one-over-one, double-hung configurations dominate all elevations and are slightly recessed to avoid interruption of the wall plane. Bronze is used liberally on the first two stories, forming spandrels that divide the first and second levels, window frames, entrance doors, shop fronts, and select railings. Simple recessed panels at select ends of the building run the full height of the main mass and suggest plain classically inspired pilasters. A parapet wall with a deeply recessed mortar joint tops the tenth story and forms the terrace edge that contains the building's upper two stories. The principal entrance consists of four pairs of deeply recessed bronze and glass doors centrally located on the Vermont Avenue elevation. Above the entry are tall bronze-framed windows with fixed lights, each surrounded by flush black granite panels and separated by three, two-story granite piers. Projecting limestone frames surround the third-story windows aligned above the entrance. The architects designed the interior spaces to be reserved yet dramatic. The entrance lobby is both one and two stories in height and forms an irregular polygonal footprint with walls that splay outward. The space is defined by piers sheathed in black Alberene, a type of soapstone, and grey marble covers the walls. Recessed cove lighting illuminates the lobby. The first floor elevator lobbies are lit by a luminous rear wall. The elevator doors have a satin bronze finish with fluted horizontal bands. Three important rooms directly associated with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) are located on the eleventh and twelfth floors. These rooms convey a feeling of reserved richness, using high quality materials with spare decorative elements. The director's office suite, once occupied by Jesse Holman Jones, features knot pine paneling that is now painted. The modernization project of 2011 to 2016 stripped the paint off the Knotty Pine and restored the luster of highly polished and stained original knotty pine in Phase One of construction. The board room walls are covered in Appalachian oak paneling, while walnut paneling covers the conference room walls. Floors of all three rooms historically were covered in carpeting. Other interior spaces employ high-quality materials. Simply elegant, they lack ornate decorative elements. Throughout the interior, walls are clad with polished white Alabama marble panels to a height of seven feet with plaster finishes above. Baseboards and door trim are black Alberene. Floors are covered with cream-colored terrazzo with inset panels and circles of black Alberene and grey terrazzo that mark important corridor junctions. Water fountains set in large, recessed, circular marble panels with Alberene frames are among the most prominent interior features.

The relationship is represented by the equation: :\\\\frac{L}{L_{\\\\odot}} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{M}{M_{\\\\odot}}\\\\right)^a where L‚äô and M‚äô are the luminosity and mass of the Sun and 1 < a < 6. The value a = 3.5 is commonly used for main-sequence stars. This equation and the usual value of a = 3.5 only applies to main-sequence stars with masses 2M‚äô < M < 55M‚äô and does not apply to red giants or white dwarfs. As a star approaches the Eddington Luminosity then a = 1\\\\. In summary, the relations for stars with different ranges of mass are, to a good approximation, as the following: :\\\\frac{L}{L_{\\\\odot}} \\\\approx 0.23\\\\left(\\\\frac{M}{M_{\\\\odot}}\\\\right)^{2.3} \\\\qquad (M < 0.43M_{\\\\odot}) :\\\\frac{L}{L_{\\\\odot}} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{M}{M_{\\\\odot}}\\\\right)^4 \\\\qquad\\\\qquad (0.43M_{\\\\odot} < M < 2M_{\\\\odot}) :\\\\frac{L}{L_{\\\\odot}} \\\\approx 1.4\\\\left(\\\\frac{M}{M_{\\\\odot}}\\\\right)^{3.5} \\\\qquad (2M_{\\\\odot} < M < 55M_{\\\\odot}) :\\\\frac{L}{L_{\\\\odot}} \\\\approx 32000 \\\\frac{M}{M_{\\\\odot}} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad (M > 55M_{\\\\odot}) For stars with masses less than 0.43M‚äô, convection is the sole energy transport process, so the relation changes significantly. For stars with masses M > 55M‚äô the relationship flattens out and becomes L ‚àù M but in fact those stars don't last because they are unstable and quickly lose matter by intense solar winds. It can be shown this change is due to an increase in radiation pressure in massive stars. These equations are determined empirically by determining the mass of stars in binary systems to which the distance is known via standard parallax measurements or other techniques. After enough stars are plotted, stars will form a line on a logarithmic plot and slope of the line gives the proper value of a. Another form, valid for K-type main-sequence stars, that avoids the discontinuity in the exponent has been given by Cuntz & Wang; it reads: :\\\\frac{L}{L_{\\\\odot}} \\\\approx \\\\left(\\\\frac{M}{M_{\\\\odot}}\\\\right)^{a(M)} \\\\qquad\\\\qquad (0.20M_{\\\\odot} < M < 0.85M_{\\\\odot}) with :a(M) = -141.7 \\\\cdot M^4 + 232.4 \\\\cdot M^3 - 129.1 \\\\cdot M^2 + 33.29 \\\\cdot M + 0.215 (M in M‚äô). This relation is based on data by Mann and collaborators, who used moderate-resolution spectra of nearby late-K and M dwarfs with known parallaxes and interferometrically determined radii to refine their effective temperatures and luminosities. Those stars have also been used as a calibration sample for Kepler candidate objects. Besides avoiding the discontinuity in the exponent at M = 0.43M‚äô, the relation also recovers a = 4.0 for M ‚âÉ 0.85M‚äô. The mass/luminosity relation is important because it can be used to find the distance to binary systems which are too far for normal parallax measurements, using a technique called \\"dynamical parallax\\". In this technique, the masses of the two stars in a binary system are estimated, usually as being the mass of the Sun. Then, using Kepler's laws of celestial mechanics, the distance between the stars is calculated. Once this distance is found, the distance away can be found via the arc subtended in the sky, giving a preliminary distance measurement. From this measurement and the apparent magnitudes of both stars, the luminosities can be found, and by using the mass‚Äìluminosity relationship, the masses of each star. These masses are used to re-calculate the separation distance, and the process is repeated. The process is iterated many times, and accuracies as high as 5% can be achieved. The mass/luminosity relationship can also be used to determine the lifetime of stars by noting that lifetime is approximately proportional to M/L although one finds that more massive stars have shorter lifetimes than what the M/L relationship predicts. A more sophisticated calculation factors in a star's loss of mass over time. Derivation Deriving a theoretically exact mass/luminosity relation requires finding the energy generation equation and building a thermodynamic model of the inside of a star. However, the basic relation L ‚àù M3 can be derived using some basic physics and simplifying assumptions. The first such derivation was performed by astrophysicist Arthur Eddington in 1924. The derivation showed that stars can be approximately modelled as ideal gases, which was a new, somewhat radical idea at the time. What follows is a somewhat more modern approach based on the same principles. An important factor controlling the luminosity of a star (energy emitted per unit time) is the rate of energy dissipation through its bulk. Where there is no heat convection, this dissipation happens mainly by photons diffusing. By integrating Fick's first law over the surface of some radius r in the radiation zone (where there is negligible convection), we get the total outgoing energy flux which is equal to the luminosity by conservation of energy: ::L = -4\\\\pi\\\\,r^2 D\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial r} Where D is the photons diffusion coefficient, and u is the energy density. Note that this assumes that the star is not fully convective, and that all heat creating processes (nucleosynthesis) happen in the core, below the radiation zone. These two assumptions are not correct in red giants, which do not obey the usual mass- luminosity relation. Stars of low mass are also fully convective, hence do not obey the law. Approximating the star by a black body, the energy density is related to the temperature by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: ::u = \\\\frac{4}{c} \\\\, \\\\sigma_B \\\\, T^4 where ::\\\\sigma_B = \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi^5 k_B^4 }{15 c^2 h^3} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi^2 k_B^4}{60 \\\\hbar^3 c^2}. is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, c is the speed of light, kB is Boltzmann constant and \\\\hbar is the reduced Planck constant. As in the elementary theory of diffusion coefficient in gases, the diffusion coefficient D approximately satisfies: :: D = \\\\frac{1}{3}c\\\\,\\\\lambda where Œª is the photon mean free path. Since matter is fully ionized in the star core (as well as where the temperature is of the same order of magnitude as inside the core), photons collide mainly with electrons, and so Œª satisfies :: \\\\lambda = \\\\frac{1}{n_e\\\\sigma_{e\\\\cdot\\\\gamma}} Here n_e is the electron density and: ::\\\\sigma_{e\\\\cdot\\\\gamma} = \\\\frac{8\\\\pi}{3}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\hbar c}{m_ec^2}\\\\right)^2 is the cross section for electron-photon scattering, equal to Thomson cross-section. Œ± is the fine-structure constant and me the electron mass. The average stellar electron density is related to the star mass M and radius R ::\\\\langle n_e \\\\rangle = \\\\frac{M}{m_n 4\\\\pi R^3/3} Finally, by the virial theorem, the total kinetic energy is equal to half the gravitational potential energy EG, so if the average nuclei mass is mn, then the average kinetic energy per nucleus satisfies: ::\\\\frac{3}{2}k_B T = \\\\frac{1}{2}E_G\\\\frac{m_n}{M} = C\\\\frac{3}{10}\\\\frac{G M m_n}{R} where the temperature T is averaged over the star and C is a factor of order one related to the stellar structure and can be estimated from the star approximate polytropic index. Note that this does not hold for large enough stars, where the radiation pressure is larger than the gas pressure in the radiation zone, hence the relation between temperature, mass and radius is different, as elaborated below. Wrapping up everything, we also take r to be equal to R up to a factor, and ne at r is replaced by its stellar average up to a factor. The combined factor is approximately 1/15 for the sun, and we get: :L = -4\\\\pi\\\\,r^2 D\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial r} \\\\approx 4\\\\pi\\\\,R^2 D\\\\frac{u}{R} ::L \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{15}\\\\frac{64\\\\pi^2}{9}\\\\frac {\\\\sigma_B}{\\\\sigma_{e\\\\cdot\\\\gamma}}\\\\frac{R^4 T^4 m_n}{M} :: \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{15}\\\\frac{2\\\\pi^3}{9\\\\cdot5^5}\\\\frac {G^4\\\\,m_e^2\\\\,m_n^5}{\\\\alpha^2\\\\hbar^5}\\\\,M^3 = 4\\\\cdot {10^{26}}_W \\\\,\\\\left(\\\\frac{M}{M_{\\\\odot}}\\\\right)^3 The added factor is actually dependent on M, therefore the law has an approximate M^{3.5} dependence. Distinguishing between small and large stellar masses One may distinguish between the cases of small and large stellar masses by deriving the above results using radiation pressure. In this case, it is easier to use the optical opacity \\\\kappa and to consider the internal temperature TI directly; more precisely, one can consider the average temperature in the radiation zone. The consideration begins by noting the relation between the radiation pressure Prad and luminosity. The gradient of radiation pressure is equal to the momentum transfer absorbed from the radiation, giving: \\\\frac{dP_{rad}}{dr} = -\\\\frac {\\\\kappa\\\\rho}{c}\\\\frac{L}{4\\\\pi r^2}, where c is the velocity of light. Here, 1/\\\\kappa\\\\rho = l; the photon mean free path. The radiation pressure is related to the temperature by P_{rad} = \\\\frac{4\\\\sigma}{3c}{T_I}^4, therefore {T_I}^3\\\\frac{dT_I}{dr} = -\\\\frac {3\\\\kappa\\\\rho}{16\\\\sigma}\\\\frac{L}{4\\\\pi r^2}, from which it follows directly that L \\\\varpropto {T_I}^4 \\\\frac {R}{\\\\rho} \\\\varpropto {T_I}^4 \\\\frac {R^4}{M}. In the radiation zone gravity is balanced by the pressure on the gas coming from both itself (approximated by ideal gas pressure) and from the radiation. For a small enough stellar mass the latter is negligible and one arrives at T_I \\\\varpropto \\\\frac {M}{R} as before. More precisely, since integration was done from 0 to R so T_I-T_E on the left side, but the surface temperature TE can be neglected with respect to the internal temperature TI. From this it follows directly that L \\\\varpropto M^3. For a large enough stellar mass, the radiation pressure is larger than the gas pressure in the radiation zone. Plugging in the radiation pressure, instead of the ideal gas pressure used above, yields {T_I}^4\\\\varpropto \\\\frac{M^2}{R^4}, hence L \\\\varpropto M. Core and surface temperatures To the first approximation, stars are black body radiators with a surface area of 4œÄR2. Thus, from the Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann law, the luminosity is related to the surface temperature TS, and through it to the color of the star, by :L = 4\\\\pi R^2\\\\sigma_B T_S^4 where œÉB is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, 5.67 √ó 10‚àí8W m‚àí2 K‚àí4. The luminosity is equal to the total energy produced by the star per unit time. Since this energy is produced by nucleosynthesis, usually in the star core (this is not true for red giants), the core temperature is related to the luminosity by the nucleosynthesis rate per unit volume: ::L = \\\\frac{dE}{dt} \\\\approx \\\\epsilon \\\\, \\\\frac{4\\\\pi}{3} R^3 \\\\, n_A \\\\, n_B \\\\, \\\\frac{4\\\\sqrt{2}}{\\\\sqrt{3 m_R}}\\\\, \\\\sqrt{E_0(T)} \\\\frac{S(E_0(T))}{kT} e^{-\\\\frac{3E_0(T)}{kT}} Here, Œµ is the total energy emitted in the chain reaction or reaction cycle. E_0 = \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{E_G}\\\\,kT/2\\\\right)^{2/3} is the Gamow peak energy, dependent on EG, the Gamow factor. Additionally, S(E)/E is the reaction cross section, n is number density, m_R = m_A\\\\cdot m_B/(m_A+m_B) is the reduced mass for the particle collision, and A,B are the two species participating in the limiting reaction (e.g. both stand for a proton in the proton-proton chain reaction, or A a proton and B an nucleus for the CNO cycle). Since the radius R is itself a function of the temperature and the mass, one may solve this equation to get the core temperature.

The state is responsible for promoting education and instruction and ensuring universal access to education for all Maltese citizens the existence of a system of schools and institutions accessible to all Maltese citizens. The objectives of education in Malta include intellectual and moral development and the preparation of every citizen to contribute productively to the national economy. Although Maltese citizens had access to education during the Arab administration of 870 to 1090, the arrival of a number of religious orders in the following four centuries brought religious-based education to the island for wealthy families. The arrival of the Knights Hospitaller saw the establishment of the University of Malta, around which a number of primary, secondary and post- secondary institutions were established. Education in Malta has been universally available at the primary level since the ejection of the Knights Hospitaller by the French in 1798, when state-funded elementary schooling was established. In 1878, English replaced Italian as the primary language of instruction, and education was made compulsory in 1946 in response to a number of children not attending school due to poverty between World Wars One and Two. The age at which education became compulsory was lowered to five years in 1988 Malta's educational system is divided into four stages: pre-primary (ages 3‚Äì5), primary (ages 5‚Äì11), secondary (ages 11‚Äì16) and tertiary. Pre-primary education is optional but fully funded by the state. In their last ten years of primary education, students are placed on tracks based on educational attainment, and at the age of eleven, students sit an eleven plus examination to eliminate a student's secondary schooling direction. Success in the eleven plus exam places a student in a junior lyceum - a prestigious secondary school - while mediocre performance or not sitting the examination places a student in a less competitive secondary school. Secondary Education Certificate (NEC) examinations are taken at age 16, and matriculation examinations are taken at age 18 to determine university entrance eligibility. In 2008, 26,711 primary students, 25,793 secondary students, 5,719 post-secondary students, 9,472 tertiary students and 6,268 vocational students were enrolled in educational courses in Malta. Approximately 30 per cent of Malta's primary and secondary school students are enrolled in private schools, most of which are operated by the Catholic Church. Malta's highest post-secondary institution is the University of Malta, which has operated since 1552  History  The historic Sacra Infermeria hospital, original site of the medieval University of Malta's medical school, now operates as the Mediterranean Conference Center. While education in Malta dates back to the period of Arab occupation between 870 and 1090 through the introduction of Arabic numerals, the arrival of the Franciscans in 1350, the Carmelites in 1418, the Dominican Order in 1450, the Augustinians in 1460 and the Friars Minor in 1492 brought religious-based education to the island. Members of these groups were asked to serve as private tutors for the children of wealthy parents, and later moved to set up classes for instruction in Italian, Latin and numeracy. In 1592, the Collegium Melitense (what was to become the University of Malta) was established by the Society of Jesus as a result of a direct order from Pope Clements VIII, and around this institution a number of others flourished, including a grammar school, a preparatory school and institutions for the study of cartography, naval architecture and navigation. In addition to public options, it was possible to hire private tutors in a number of different areas, including accounting, philosophy, navigation and languages. During this period, however, education for those without wealth was non-existent. During the 16th century, philosophy, theology, grammar and the humanities were taught at the Collegium, and following Europe's temporary recovery from the Black Death in 1675, the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller appointed a new lecturer in anatomy and surgery at Sacra Infermeria, essentially establishing the University of Malta's medical school. The Roman Catholic Church, however, was against educating the lower classes and focused on those who afforded to pay. This resulted in mass illiteracy by the end of the Order of St John and took until the second half of the 19th century, under British rule, to have a sprint towards further inclusion.p. 22 The ejection of the Knights Hospitaller by the French Republic in 1798 brought a reformation of the educational system with it due to the disparity between the traditional ideals of the Knights and the revolutionary ideals of the French. Private schooling was banned, elementary schooling was introduced and funded by the state, and adult education was introduced. The gradual introduction of universal education for primary school students was an ideal born before and during the French Revolution, while private schools were abolished due to their traditional association with the Catholic Church, an institution rejected by those involved in the Revolution. In addition, Napoleon I abolished the University of Malta just five days after his ejection of the Knights, although this decision was reversed after the British ejected the French the following year. In 1799, Malta fell under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom, and attempts were made to adjust Malta's institutions towards a British style.Melita Historica (New Series) 12(1996)1(47-74) La societ√° delle scuole normali della Valletta: a brief historical backdrop. Joe Debono This 1903 sculpture in Valletta's Upper Barrakka Gardens, \\"Les Gavroches\\" by Maltese artist Antonio Sciortino, depicts the poverty children experienced in Malta in the early 20th century. Under Government Ponsonby, in 1833, the Catholic Church in Malta was staunchly against public education; the only effort done by the priesthood is to demand people not to accept education or be condemned by excommunication, together with other religious consequences.p. 95 Focus on religious teaching, at the exclusion of important matters, left over 97% of the country illiterate. The role of Canon Fortunato Panzavecchia as Director of Schools proved him to be unworthy and stubborn of progress. He even fabricated irrelevant religious- related documents about supposed improvements. The British observed that the Director was more interested in the failure of educating the common people and was unfit for purpose.http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.05(1968-71)/MH.5(1968)3/orig06.pdf In 1847, elementary schooling was changed to the British model, schools were opened in every village and education was made free of charge. In 1878, the mode of language education delivery changed following the publication of two reports on the matter. Italian language education was replaced by instruction in the English language, and the use of Maltese was encouraged in the primary years. However, English was the language in which education was delivered at all stages of education following primary school. Debate continued until the 1930s over which language should be used in Maltese education - Italian or English. During World War I, the interwar years and World War II, widespread poverty in Malta prevented the children of the lower classes from pursuing basic education in favor of staying home to assist parents with agricultural work and other income earning activities. To counteract this phenomenon, on 1 February 1946 education was declared compulsory till the age of 14.http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150125/life- features/Elementary-education-in-Malta-during-the-early-British-period.553515 In 1964, Malta became an independent nation, and in 1988 a new Education Act was passed, lowering the compulsory education age to five years, decentralising educational decision making and establishing a right for any person to apply for a licence to open a school. The Faculty of Arts, Sciences and Theology at the University of Malta was also reinstated.  Statistics  In 2008, 26,711 primary students, 25,793 secondary students, 5,719 post- secondary students, 9,472 tertiary students and 6,268 vocational students were enrolled in educational courses in Malta. Approximately 30 per cent of students of school age attend private schools, most of which are operated by the Catholic Church. In 2009, 34.9 per cent of the population between 18 and 24 years of age had not completed secondary school, while in 2008 92 per cent of the population was considered literate. Malta ranks equal eleventh in the world on the national IQ scale. The compulsory education period in Malta has been between five and 16 years of age since the introduction of the Education Act 1988. This is an increase from up to 12 years of age in 1924 (in this year, school attendance became compulsory for those already enrolled - the act of enrollment itself was not compulsory) and 14 years of age in 1946, when compulsory school attendance was introduced for all students, enrolled or otherwise. Compulsory schooling has always applied to both males and females during its existence.  Structure   School education  Schooling is compulsory from the age of five, although free-of-charge kindergarten is available to all students beginning at age three. Approximately 94 per cent of three- and four-year-olds attend kindergarten. A number of private operators exist, but free state-run institutions are also popular. State-run Maltese kindergartens are required to have one staff member present for every ten children present, while this ratio decreases to 1:20 for independently run institutions. During the kindergarten years, the focus is on play, not formal education. From kindergarten, students transition to primary school, which is compulsory from the age of five. Since 1980, all state-run primary schools have been co-educational, with many independent schools following suit. However, church-run primary schools are usually single-sex. Classes usually have a limit of thirty students, and a minimum teacher to student ratio has been set at 1:19 in all schools, whether they be state-run, church-run or independent. Formal end-of-year examinations commence starting in Year 4 to dictate class streaming arrangements for the following year. Students are examined in English, Maltese, mathematics, religion and social studies. Despite the fact that eleven-plus examinations highlight inequality and failures, and are recognized as ineffective educational tools by experts, Malta still implements such exams. In Year 6, when most pupils have turned eleven years of age, an eleven-plus exam is given to students to determine which students attend which secondary schools. Students are tested in English language, Maltese language, mathematics, social studies and religion; the latter is optional for those not adhering to the faith taught in schools. While 73 per cent of eleven-year-old students sat the eleven-plus exam in 2001, only about 54 percent pass it each year. Students achieving success in the eleven-plus exam go on to attend prestigious 'junior lyceums' during their secondary years, whilst those who do not attend 'area secondary schools'. This is similar to the operation of the Tripartite System in the United Kingdom following World War II. State-run junior lyceums and area secondary schools are single-sex. Junior lyceums are divided into two grade stages. The first stage is an introductory stage, and runs for the first two years of secondary schooling. Students study essentially the same subjects with very limited curriculum options in order to provide a good grounding for future studies. Following the two-year introductory cycle, a three-year specialist stage occurs during which students study a common core curriculum as well as a number of elective subjects. This orientation is similar at area secondary schools, although the introductory period is longer, at three years in duration, and the final specialist period is shorter, at two years. The staff- student ratio is set at 1:11, and the school leaving age is 16. Examinations in Maltese secondary schools are taken at both age 16 and 18, with the latter being a final optional set of matriculation examinations. The examinations taken at age 16 are the Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) exams, which have operated since 1994, before which the GCE Ordinary Level was used as a secondary certificate examination. The examinations taken at 18, those enabling entry into university, are the Matriculation Certificate examinations, based on the International Baccalaureate. These examinations replaced the GCE Advanced Levels.  Day-to-day operation  A number of students travel to school using the nation's bus network, which is free for state school students to use. Schools in Malta generally begin their school day at 8:30am and finish at 2:40pm. Students receive three days of holidays in November 15 days of holidays over Christmas, two days of holidays in March and eight days of holidays in April, in addition to public holidays. Maltese school students receive the highest number of days off of all school students in Europe, with 90 days during the 2010-11 academic year being non-school days. This is 14 days more than the European average of 76. Virtually all Maltese state schools run tuck shops, while some secondary schools are home to cafeterias. State schools provide textbooks free of charge to their students, while private schools generally require their students to pay for their textbooks, enabling the latter to change their textbooks and textbook editions more frequently. All primary schools have at least four computers, one printer, a large monitor and a teacher's laptop computer in their classrooms, while many secondary schools have specialised rooms necessary to teach subjects such as Home Economics and Food Technology. An average of 22.5 students are enrolled per primary school class, with the average rising to 24.3 in secondary school classes. Primary school teachers are expected to dedicate five hours per week to each of Maltese, English and mathematics, one hour per week to science, two hours per weeks to arts and crafts, two hours per week to social studies, one hour and 15 minutes per week to social studies, and two and a half hours per week to physical education and religion. State school syllabi at the secondary level are set by the local examination bodies.  Tertiary education  Under the Education Act of 1988, the Government of Malta is obligated to provide free university education to eligible residents with sufficient qualifications for entry. However, due to funding constraints, the University of Malta offers some courses only every other year in order to maximise course offerings with optimum funding usage. 10,000 students currently study at the University. Most Bachelor degree courses run for three years, including law, which in other common law countries is often lengthier. Educational management  Administration  State-run education in Malta is administered at the national level of government, with the Minister for Education empowered to make orders, or 'Legal Notices', relating to the administration of education throughout the country. The Minister for Education is appointed by the President on advice of the Prime Minister and is responsible for a number of education-related government functions (such as the operation of schools and libraries) as well as tertiary education in the country. The Ministry of Education, the national government department responsible for education in Malta, is headed by a Permanent Secretary. The Education Division of the Ministry is responsible for setting a number of annual nationwide examinations, managing human resources in Malta's educational system, selecting school textbook lists, allocating students to schools based on area, managing the Ministry's educational finances and promoting a number of cultural, sporting and social activities. Malta's Ministry of Education is currently being decentralised with the aim of having schools managed at the local level. With the exception of the currently occurring educational management decentralisation process, regional administration of education in Malta is limited. However, the island of Gozo does maintain a form of regional educational administration through the Ministry for Gozo. Although the Ministry for Education manages education throughout Malta, the Ministry for Gozo is responsible for the remuneration of the island's teaching staff. Local authorities such as Malta's numerous Local Councils have no official ties to Malta's educational system but often donate to local schools and maintain preschool building structures.  Teacher development  Primary and secondary school teachers begin their teacher education at the University of Malta by gaining a Bachelor of Education (Honours), which typically takes four years of study to achieve. To gain entry into the University to study primary or secondary education, students must not only meet the University's general entry requirements but also a number of other special course requirements. University students seeking to enter the teaching profession may also become qualified by gaining a postgraduate certificate in education. Two years of professional teaching practice is also generally required. The Minister for Education may also grant a temporary warrant to teach, valid for one year, to any person the Minister believes has the ability to teach in the country. In 2019, teachers entering the workforce are paid a minimum of ‚Ç¨23,936 per year, with the most experienced teachers being paid ‚Ç¨27,340 per year after 18 years of service. Heads of School received a minimum of ‚Ç¨27,707.00 per year.2014\\\\. [ebook] Naxxar: ANSEK, p.415.

In December 1969, she was transferred to Mexico and served as Chihuahua until July 2001. History Construction and commissioning Rednour was laid down as the Rudderow-class destroyer escort USS Rednour (DE-592) on 30 December 1943 by Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard, Inc., at Hingham, Massachusetts, and was launched on 12 February 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Forrest O. Rednour, the widow of the ships namesake, Ship's Cook Second Class Forrest O. Rednour, USCG. The ship was reclassified as a Crosley-class high-speed transport and redesignated APD-102 on 17 July 1944. After conversion to her new role, she was commissioned on 30 December 1944 with Lieutenant Commander Roland H. Cramer in command. U.S. Navy (1944-1946) Pacific War After shakedown in Bermudan waters, Rednour arrived in Norfolk, Virginia, on 7 February 1945. She then underwent amphibious training in the Chesapeake Bay and coastal training operations, after which she departed Melville, Rhode Island, on 24 February 1945, bound for World War II service in the Pacific. Arriving at San Diego, California, on 11 March 1945, rednour engaged in a week of coastal training exercises before standing in to Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, on 25 March 1945. There she assisted in the training of underwater demolition teams through 8 April 1945, when she steamed as an escort for several cargo ships en route Ulithi Atoll via the Marshall Islands. Rednour departed Ulithi Atoll on 23 April 1945, overtaking a convoy which arrived off the Hagushi beaches of Okinawa on 26 April 1945. She supported the Okinawa campaign, patrolling off Kerama Retto through the following month and assisted in the screening of inward- and outward-bound convoys. She also assisted in repelling almost constant air raids. On the night of 27 May 1945, Rednour assumed an antiaircraft patrol station 14 nautical miles (26 kilometers)west of Zampa-Misaki (Point Bolo), Okinawa, in company with high-speed transport USS Loy (APD-56) and destroyer escort USS Eisele (DE-34). Shortly before midnight, the first of several kamikaze suicide planes which attacked Loy was exploded in midair by antiaircraft fire, but a second aircraft crashed Loy. A third aircraft evaded the gunfire, but a fourth closed rapidly on Rednours starboard bow. Despite the withering curtain of fire thrown up by her gunners, the plane crashed Rednours stern, starting fires and blowing a 10-foot (3-meter) hole in her main deck. Three men were killed and 13 wounded. After driving off yet another suicide plane, Rednour entered Kerama roadstead for temporary battle damage repairs. Departing Okinawa on 14 June 1945, Rednour steamed for California, stopping en route at both Leyte in the Philippine Islands and Pearl Harbor. Arriving at San Pedro, California, on 22 July 1945, she underwent a general overhaul. World War II came to end with the surrender of Japan on 15 August 1945 while Rednour was in California. Postwar Her overhaul complete, Rednour got underway for service in the Marshall- Gilbert Islands Command with Transport Division 104. Steaming via Pearl Harbor and Saipan, she arrived at Eniwetok on 15 September 1945. During the following months she carried passengers, vehicles, provisions, and other cargo between Eniwetok, Wake Island, Ponape, and Kwajalein. From 29 October 1945 through 5 November 1945, she served as headquarters ship for a hydrographic survey party from the survey ship USS Hydrographer (AGS-2) in the area of Taongi Atoll. Rednours inter-island transport service ended on 5 January 1946 when she departed Kwajalein with the staff and records of the Marshall-Gilberts Command, bound for Guam. Debarking her passengers and records at Apra Harbor, Guam, on 9 January 1946, she set course for the United States via Kwajalein and Pearl Harbor, arriving at San Pedro on 2 February 1946. Departing San Pedro on 20 February 1946, Rednour transited the Panama Canal and arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 8 March 1946 to prepare for inactivation. She departed Norfolk on 31 March 1946 bound for Green Cove Springs, Florida. Decommissioning Rednour decommissioned at Green Cove Springs on 24 July 1946, and was assigned to the Florida Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet there. She later was towed to Orange, Texas, to become part of the Texas Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, and while there was stricken from the Navy List on 1 March 1967. Mexican Navy (1969-2001) Rednour was transferred to Mexico in December 1969. She served in the Mexican Navy as ARM Chihuahua (B08) and was renamed ARM Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos y Pav√≥n in 1994. Her name was later restored to Chihuahua with the new pennant number of E22. Chihuahua was stricken from the Mexican Navy on 16 July 2001. Honors and awards Rednour received one battle star for her World War II service.

It is locally used as cooking oil, exported for use in much commercial food and personal care products and is converted into biofuel. It produces up to 10 times more oil per unit area than soybeans, rapeseed or sunflowers. Oil palms produce 38% of the world's vegetable-oil output on 5% of the world‚Äôs vegetable-oil farmland. Palm oil plantations, typically monoculture crops are under increasing scrutiny for their effects on the environment, including loss of carbon-sequestering, biodiverse forest land. There is also concern over displacement and disruption of human and animal populations due to palm oil cultivation. Statistics Oil palms (Elaeis guineensis) An estimated 1.5 million small farmers grow the crop in Indonesia, along with about 500,000 people directly employed in the sector in Malaysia, plus those connected with related industries. As of 2006, the cumulative land area of palm oil plantations is approximately . In 2005 the Malaysian Palm Oil Association, responsible for about half of the world's crop, estimated that they manage about half a billion perennial carbon-sequestering palm trees. Demand for palm oil has been rising and is expected to climb further. Between 1967 and 2000 the area under cultivation in Indonesia expanded from less than to more than . Deforestation in Indonesia for palm oil (and illegal logging) is so rapid that a 2007 United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report said that most of the country's forest might be destroyed by 2022. The rate of forest loss has declined in the past decade. Global production is forecast at a record 46.9m tonnes in 2010, up from 45.3m in 2009, with Indonesia providing most of the increase. Social issues Oil palm is a valuable economic crop and provides a source of employment. It allows small landholders to participate in the cash economy and often results in improvements to local infrastructure and greater access to services such as schools and health facilities. In some areas, the cultivation of oil palm has replaced traditional practices, often due to the higher income potential of palm oil. The modernisation of cultivation practices has led to issues including food insecurity. This issue stems from the intensive use of land which leads to soil degradation. As a result, the ability for locals to produce their own food has dwindled and they are having to look for food in other areas as they can no longer rely exclusively on their land. However, in some cases, land has been developed by oil palm plantations without consultation or compensation of the Indigenous Peoples occupying the land. This has occurred in Papua New Guinea, Colombia, and Indonesia. In the Sarawak state of Malaysian Borneo, there has been debate over whether there was an appropriate level of consultation with the Long Teran Kanan community prior to the development of local land for palm oil plantations. Appropriation of native lands has led to conflict between the plantations and local residents in each of these countries. According to a 2008 report by NGOs including Friends of the Earth, palm oil companies have also reportedly used force to acquire land from Indigenous communities in Indonesia. Additionally, some Indonesian oil palm plantations are dependent on imported labor or undocumented immigrants, which has raised concerns about the working conditions and social impacts of these practices.  Deforestation   Habitat loss  The production of palm oil requires intensive deforestation and this has led to a gradual loss of flora and fauna in the areas where land is cleared for the cultivation of palm oil. Tropical rainforests in countries including Malaysia and Indonesia have been the most ideal countries to have large palm oil plantations as they provide the most suitable climate with ample rainfall and sunshine throughout the year. Between the years 1990 and 2005, the total land in Malaysia used for palm oil cultivation increased by 2.4 million ha and reached 4.2 million ha. During that period, over 1.1 million ha of tropical rainforest was lost. The diverse biodiversity that each rainforest possesses has been diminishing at a rapid rate as fauna is often very fragile and easily affected by deforestation. Animal wildlife has been most affected in areas where significant amounts of land, for commercial palm oil purposes, have been cleared to allow the trees to be planted. Animals have been forced to relocate and have increasingly come into contact with humans as they have started to roam around the surrounding villages in search for food. Some animals have not been able to adapt and relocate elsewhere, leading to their populations decreasing significantly and this has disrupted the symbiotic relationships that the flora and fauna have with their habitat. The figure below shows how deforestation negatively affects biodiversity when forests are converted into plantations and depicts the relatively low species richness in primary forests compared to disturbed forests.  Soil degradation  The process of removing existing flora and planting palm oil trees is detrimental for the quality of the soil in the ground. When the existing flora is removed to make way for the new plants, the soil surrounding it is often eroded away. When palm oil trees are planted, large amounts of fertilisers and pesticides are used to ensure rapid growth and the health of each tree. Younger palm oil trees absorb more valuable nutrients from the soil which degrades the quality of the soil. As the nutrients are absorbed by the young trees, there is a depletion in nutrients and consequently, there is a lower level of remaining nutrients for other trees. This problem is also another cause for the increased use of fertilisers during the palm oil production process. Distances between adjacent palm oil trees in plantations have also been designed to be very close in order to optimise use of the limited space available. This has further impacted soil quality because as the trees grow, they require more minerals and water from the soil. Due to the close distances between trees, there is a limited supply of nutrients that the trees can depend on which leads to the plantation workers shrouding the trees with higher amounts of fertilisers, pesticides and water. This process further harms the state of the soil and makes it challenging for existing flora and fauna to survive in the area. In tropical countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, where a majority of palm oil plantations are located, there are continual rain showers and sun exposure throughout the day. Palm oil plantations that are geographically located close to rivers have exacerbated impacts on surrounding local communities. This is due to the increased use of fertilisers and pesticides which has led to higher amounts of both being washed away by the frequent rain into rivers (runoff process). This is an issue because rivers are central to the daily lives of local villagers. They use water from the river for personal consumption and also use the river as a source of food, which makes them vulnerable to the residue from fertilisers and pesticides. The untreated water that the local villagers are exposed to can potentially cause detrimental health effects, including diseases such as cholera, E. coli and lead poisoning. The damage from soil erosion and poor soil quality has also affected the livelihoods of many local villagers that live close to these palm oil plantations as they can no longer depend solely on their land for the cultivation of food and timber. Local villagers are now inclined to find new sources of food and materials for shelter. As a result, local villagers have been indirectly forced to move out and relocate depending on the extent of the loss of the plants and animals native to the area. This has led to economic complications as governments now need to reallocate their resources to support these typically marginalised communities. Other environmental issues A satellite image showing deforestation in Malaysian Borneo to allow the plantation of oil palm The remaining distribution of the Sumatran orangutan in Indonesia A Sumatran orangutan at Bukit Lawang, Indonesia In Indonesia, rising demand for palm oil and timber has led to the clearing of tropical forest land in Indonesian national parks. According to a 2007 report published by UNEP, at the rate of deforestation at that time, an estimated 98 percent of Indonesian forest would be destroyed by 2022 due to legal and illegal logging, forest fires and the development of palm oil plantations. Malaysia, the second largest producer of palm oil has pledged to conserve a minimum of 50 percent of its total land area as forests. As of 2010, 58 percent of Malaysia was forested. Palm oil cultivation has been criticised for: *Greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation in tropical areas accounts for an estimated 10 percent of manmade emissions, and is a driver toward dangerous climate change. * Habitat destruction, leading to the demise of critically endangered species (e.g. the Sumatran elephant, Sumatran tiger, the Sumatran rhinoceros, and the Sumatran orangutan). *Reduced biodiversity, including damage to biodiversity hotspots.Conservation International: Biodiversity Hotspots *Cultivating crops on land that belongs to indigenous people in the Sarawak and Kalimantan states on the island of Borneo and the Malaysian state of Sabah. Water pollution In some states where oil palm is established, lax enforcement of environmental legislation leads to encroachment of plantations into riparian strips, and release of pollutants such as palm oil mill effluent (POME) in the environment. More environment-friendly practices have been developed. Among those approaches is anaerobic treatment of POME, which might allow for biogas (methane) production and electricity generation, but it is very difficult to maintain optimum growth conditions for the anaerobic organisms that break down acetate to methane (primarily Methanosaeta concilii, a species of Archaea).PCR-Based DGGE and FISH Analysis of Methanogens in Anaerobic Closed Digester Tank Treating Palm Oil Mill Effluent.

Many Indonesian and Malaysian rainforests lie atop peat bogs that store great quantities of carbon. Forest removal and bog drainage to make way for plantations releases this carbon. Researchers are looking for possible, more environmentally friendly, solutions and ways to help the situation and have suggested that if enough land is conserved and there remain large enough areas of primary forest reserves, the effects of the palm oil industry may not have as much of an impact on wildlife and biodiversity. Environmental groups like Greenpeace, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, and Amnesty International are also taking part in advocating bans on unsustainable palm oil crops and the companies that purchase these exports. Environmental groups such as Greenpeace claim that this deforestation produces far more emissions than biofuels remove. Land Clearing and the Biofuel Carbon Debt.

Greenpeace identified Indonesian peatlands--unique tropical forests whose dense soil can be burned to release carbon emissions--which are being destroyed to make way for palm oil plantations. Greenpeace argues the peatlands represent massive carbon sinks, and they claim the destruction already accounts for four percent of annual global CO‚ÇÇ emissions. However, according to the Tropical Peat Research Laboratory, at least one measurement has shown that oil palm plantations are carbon sinks because oil palms convert carbon dioxide into oxygen just as other trees do, and, as reported in Malaysia's Second National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, oil palm plantations contribute to Malaysia's net carbon sink. Greenpeace recorded peatland destruction in the Indonesian province of Riau on the island of Sumatra, home to 25 percent of Indonesia's palm oil plantations. Greenpeace claims this would have devastating consequences for Riau's peatlands, which have already been degraded by industrial development and store a massive 14.6 billion tonnes of carbon, roughly one year's greenhouse gas emissions. Environmentalists and conservationists have been called upon to team up with palm oil companies to purchase small tracts of existing palm plantation, so they can use the profits to create privately owned nature reserves. It has been suggested that this is a more productive strategy than the current confrontational approach that threatens the livelihoods of millions of smallholders. NGOs should use palm oil to drive conservation Rhett A. Butler, Mongabay, 29 August 2007 National differences A palm oil plantation in Indonesia Indonesia and Malaysia In the two countries responsible for over 80% of world oil palm production, Indonesia and Malaysia, smallholders account for 35‚Äì40% of the total area of planted oil palm and as much as 33% of the output. Elsewhere, as in West African countries that produce mainly for domestic and regional markets, smallholders produce up to 90% of the annual harvest.Vermeulen and Goad. 2006. Towards better practice in smallholder palm oil production. IIED As a result of Malaysia's commitment to retain natural forest cover on at least 50% of the nation's land, the growth of new palm oil plantations has slowed in recent years. According to Malaysia's Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Bernard Dompok, significant expansion of palm oil is no longer possible, therefore Malaysian farmers are now focusing on increasing production without expansion. In January 2008, the CEO of the Malaysian Palm Oil Council wrote a letter to the Wall Street Journal stating that Malaysia was aware of the need to pursue a sustainable palm oil industry.Malaysian Palm Trees Are Fine and Green, Too. January 25, 2008. OP-ED letter from the CEO of the Malaysian Palm Oil Council, WSJ online Since then the Malaysian government, along with palm oil companies, have increased production of certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO). Malaysia has been recognized by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil as the largest producer of CSPO, producing 50% of the world's supply, and accounting for 40% of CSPO growers worldwide. Indonesia produces 35% of the world's CSPO. In Indonesia, the Indigenous Peoples' Alliance of the Archipelago (AMAN) under the direction of Mina Susana Setra has fought for policies that find balance between economic need and indigenous people's rights. 99% of the palm oil concessions in the country concern land that is occupied by indigenous people. In 2012, AMAN led an advocacy team which won a Constitutional Court case recognizing customary land rights; however, implementation of programs that protect indigenous rights, the environment and developers have failed to come to fruition except in limited cases. Africa In Africa, the situation is very different compared to Indonesia or Malaysia. In its Human Development Report 2007-2008, the United Nations Development Program says production of palm oil in West Africa is largely sustainable, mainly because it is undertaken on a smallholder level without resorting to diversity-damaging monoculture. The United Nations Food and Agriculture program is encouraging small farmers across Africa to grow palm oil, because the crop offers opportunities to improve livelihoods and incomes for the poor. Human Development Report 2007 ‚Äì 2008, Chapter III: Avoiding dangerous climate change: strategies for mitigation United Nations Development Program Increasing demand Food and cosmetics companies, including ADM, Unilever, Cargill, Procter & Gamble, Nestle, Kraft and Burger King, are driving the demand for new palm oil supplies, How the palm oil industry is Cooking the Climate Greenpeace November 2007 demand was partly driven by a need for a replacement for high trans fat content oils. US soyoil, low in trans fat, faces palm threat, Reuters, 3 March 2007 Although palm oil is used in the production of biofuels and proposals have been made to use it in large installations, a 2012 report by the International Food Policy Research Institute concluded that the increase in palm oil production is related to food demands, not biofuel demands. Biodiesel Biodiesel made from palm oil grown on sustainable non-forest land and from established plantations reduces greenhouse gas emissions. According to Greenpeace, clearing peatland to plant oil palms releases large amounts of greenhouse gasses, and that biodiesel produced from oil palms grown on this land may not result in a net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. However, research by Malaysia's Tropical Peat Research Unit has found that oil palm plantations developed on peatland produce lower carbon dioxide emissions than forest peat swamp. However, it has been suggested that this research unit was commissioned by politicians who have interests in the palm oil industry. In 2011, eight of Malaysia's Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) plantations were certified under the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification System (ISCC), becoming part of Asia's first ISCC certified supply and production chain for palm biodiesel. This certification system complies with the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive (RED). In 2012, the European Commission approved the RSPO's biofuel certification scheme allowing certified sustainable palm oil biofuel to be sold in Europe. Sustainability In Borneo, the forest (F), is being replaced by oil palm plantations (G). These changes are irreversible for all practical purposes (H). The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), founded in 2004, works to promote the production of sustainably sourced palm oil through involvement with growers, processors, food companies, investors and NGOs. Beginning in 2008, palm oil that meets RSPO introduced standards has been designated \\"certified sustainable palm oil\\" (CSPO). Within two years of implementation, CSPO-designated palm oil comprised 7 percent of the global palm oil market. As of October 2012, 12 percent of palm oil has been certified by the RSPO. However, in the first year of CSPO certification only 30 percent of sustainable oil was marketed as CSPO. In The Economist in 2010, the RSPO was criticized for not setting standards for greenhouse-gas emissions for plantations and because its members account for only 40 percent of palm oil production. In a 2007 report, Greenpeace was critical of RSPO-member food companies saying that they are \\"dependent on suppliers that are actively engaged in deforestation and the conversion of peatlands\\". Following a contribution of $1 billion from Norway, in May 2010, Indonesia announced a two-year suspension on new agreements to clear natural forests and peatlands. Additionally, Indonesia announced plans to create its own organization similar to the RSPO, which, as a government certification system, will introduce mandatory regulation for all Indonesian palm oil producers. In 2011, Malaysia began developing a national certification, the \\"Malaysia sustainable palm oil\\" (MSPO) certification, to improve involvement in sustainable palm oil production nationwide. The certification program, aimed at small and medium-sized producers, is expected to be launched in 2014.Hanim Adnan. (2013, September 4). \\"Malaysia to launch palm oil standard by next year,\\" The Star. Accessed: October 5, 2013. Malaysia has initiated its own environmental assessment on oil palm industry based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approaches. LCA has been applied to assess the environmental impact of production of oil palm seedlings, oil palm fresh fruit bunches, crude palm oil, crude palm kernel oil and refined palm oil. The assessment on downstream industries such as bio-diesel,Puah C. W., Choo Y. M. And Ma A. N. 2010. Life Cycle Assessment for the Production and Use of Palm Biodiesel (Part 5). Journal of Oil Palm Research 22:927-933. was also conducted. In July 2020 scientists show via detailed analysis of satellite images that certified \\"sustainable\\" palm oil production resulted in deforestation of tropical forests of Sumatra and Borneo and endangered mammals' habitat degradation in the past 30 years. Carbon credit programs Oil palm producers are eligible to take part in Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) programs in which developed nations invest in clean energy projects in developing nations to earn carbon credits to offset their own greenhouse gas emissions and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. Investors have been cautious about investing in palm oil biofuel projects because of the impact the expansion of oil palm plantations has had on tropical rain forests,Carbon market takes sides in palm oil battle Carbon Finance, 23 November 2007 but according to the South East Asian CDM development company YTL-SV Carbon, many CDM projects in the palm oil sector focus on improving use of waste products to reduce gas emissions and do not contribute to the establishment of new oil palm plantations. Use of sustainable oil by corporations The World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) publishes an annual report on the use of sustainable palm oil by major corporations. In the 2011 report, 31 of the 132 companies surveyed received a top score for their use of sustainable palm oil. This represents an increase from 2009, the first year the report was issued, where no companies received top scores. The WWF reports that 87 companies have committed to using only sustainable palm oil by 2015, including Unilever and Nestl√©, both of which committed to exclusively using sustainable palm oil following demonstrations and urgings from environmental organizations in the late 2000s. Unilever commits to sustainable palm oil Food Navigator.com 2 May 2008 However, according to the WWF, the overall growth in the use of sustainable palm oil is too slow. Retailers who have made commitments to offering products containing sustainable oil, including Walmart and Carrefour, have attributed the slow rate of growth in the availability of sustainable palm oil to a lack of consumer interest and awareness in products made with sustainable palm oil. These companies have expressed concern about the potential impact of low consumer demand on the cost and future availability of sustainable palm oil. Persuading governments It may be possible to persuade governments of nations that produce competing products to enact protectionist legislation against the products of deforestation, an approach that was presented in a report by the National Farmers Union (United States) and Avoided Deforestation Partners. The 2010 report estimates that protecting the of mostly tropical forest that are lost annually worldwide would boost American agricultural revenue by $190‚Äì270 billion between 2012 and 2030. However, several conservation groups, including Conservation International, Environmental Defense Fund, National Wildlife Federation, and The Nature Conservancy, presented a rebuttal to the report, stating that it was \\"based on the assumption, totally unfounded, that deforestation in tropical countries can be easily interrupted, and its conclusions are therefore also unrealistic.\\" See also * 2015 Southeast Asian haze * Environmental issues with energy * Food vs. fuel * Southeast Asian haze * Sustainable biofuel *The Burning Season, a 2008 documentary that highlights deforestation in Indonesia for palm oil plantations * Synthetic palm oil Companies: *Criticisms of Cargill *Wilmar International References Further reading  * External links * Greening the World with Palm Oil? ‚Äì an in-depth analysis on palm oil's impact on the environment, Mongabay.com, January 26, 2011 * Cooking the Climate ‚Äì a Greenpeace report on the palm oil industry * Palm oil publications from Greenpeace * Bruce Parry's Penan documentary showing the social and environmental impact of palm plantations in Malaysia * \\"The slippery business of palm oil\\" ‚Äì The Guardian, November 6, 2008 * \\"Palm oil: the biofuel of the future driving an ecological disaster now\\" ‚Äì The Guardian, April 4, 2006 * \\"Palm Oil and Tropical Deforestation: Is There a Sustainable Solution?\\" ‚Äì Union of Concerned Scientists Category:Palm oil Category:Environmental impact of the energy industry Category:Food and the environment Palm oil Category:Social impact Category:Biofuels Category:Climate change and agriculture ","title":"Social and environmental impact of palm oil"},{"id":"24082676","text":"Mundo Novo refers to the following places in Brazil: * Mundo Novo, Goi√°s, municipality in Goi√°s * Mundo Novo, Bahia, municipality in Bahia * Mundo Novo, Mato Grosso do Sul, municipality in Mato Grosso do Sul ","title":"Mundo Novo"},{"id":"24082685","text":"WYWH may refer to: * WYWH-LP, a low-power radio station (104.5 FM) licensed to Athens, Ohio, United States * WYWH, a 2010 album by The Concretes, or the title song * Wish You Were Here (disambiguation), several uses ","title":"WYWH"},{"id":"24082693","text":"Thomas Lyster (5 July 1840, in County Kilkenny, Ireland - 17 August 1865, in HMS Tamar off Singapore) was an Anglo-Irish British Army officer of Royal Engineers best known as the aide to General Charles George Gordon during his Chinese service.

He claimed to be the Emperor Alexios II Komnenos, who had been murdered in 1183.  Career of the false Alexios II  Pseudo-Alexios II was a young man from Constantinople, whose resemblance to the deceased emperor and his father Manuel I Komnenos convinced many of the veracity of his claims. He visited Iconium and sought an audience with Sultan Kilij Arslan II. The sultan, struck by the resemblance to Manuel, allowed him to enroll troops, but he refused to break the treaty he had concluded with Isaac II, and thus lose the tribute he was receiving from the Byzantine Empire. The pretender assembled an army of 8,000 men and ravaged the valley of the Maeander River, storming several cities, including the rich city of Chonae in order to appease his troops with plunder. Isaac sent his brother Alexios to deal with the pretender, but the imperial troops had very little success. The false Alexios' career came to a sudden stop when he was assassinated by a priest, who was infuriated with Alexios' alliance with the Muslim Turks, his permission for them to plunder the richest cities in Asia Minor, and his tolerance of the desecration of the churches in these cities that the Turks committed. The assassin carried the head of the pretender to the sebastocrator Alexios, who was so taken aback by the similarities of its features to those of Manuel I, that he exclaimed \\"Those who followed him may be innocent after all.\\"  Other pretenders  After the death of Pseudo-Alexios, several others also assumed the name of Alexios II. One was taken in Paphlagonia and put to death. Another rose up at Nicomedia in 1195/1196, but he was captured and blinded.

Originally built in 1951, the structure was widened and strengthened in 1992. Carrying two lanes of vehicular traffic, the bridge is 286 metres long and stands 91 metres above Rock Creek. Location Situated about halfway between Osoyoos & Rock Creek, it crosses Rock Creek between its confluence with two of its tributaries, McKinney Creek and Baker Creek. At the west end of the bridge is the start of the road to the Mount Baldy Ski Area. Alterations A look across the bridge from its east end. The original stringer-supported bridge was constructed in 1951. It was designed to comply with the HS20 design codes released by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, which were current at the time. In the early 1990s, the government of British Columbia, responsible for the upkeep of Rock Creek Canyon Bridge, reviewed it and decided that the structure was not wide enough to cope with modern traffic. Instead of replacing the bridge altogether, significant alterations to the bridge were made in 1992, a much less expensive option. The capacity of the structure was increased to comply with more rigorous and up- to-date design codes. The deck was widened, from to , and was made of composite steel and concrete. Additionally, some seismic improvements were undertaken and the bridge was repainted. These works were designed and supervised by Buckland and Taylor Ltd, a bridge engineering firm, and the project was delivered on time and under budget. The construction works were phased, keeping one lane open at all times to minimise the traffic disruption that a full closure would cause.

She is a pioneer and leader in the field of women and men in scientific and academic occupations and organizations, with work that has significant implications for science and technology policies. Her work has shaped understandings of complex issues in path-breaking ways including: # ways that team composition, modes of collaboration, work practices, and work climate explain publication productivity among scientists; # social and organizational features of departments, research groups, and advisor-advisee relationships that influence the proportions of doctoral degrees awarded to women in science and engineering; # relationships between family characteristics and publication productivity among women and men in academic science that go beyond being married or not married and the presence/absence of children and that address the effects of type of marriage (first or subsequent, and occupation of spouse) and type of family composition (age/stage of children); # patterns and predictors of work-family conflict in academic science that both vary, and converge, by gender in unexpected ways, with implications for building institutions that support strong scientific work forces; # types of programs--organized initiatives intended to open pathways--for undergraduate women in science that do (and do not) support attainment of women as majors in science and engineering. Education and professional history Fox received a B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. in Sociology from University of Michigan. Mary Frank Fox has advised numerous boards on science and technology policy, including the NSF Human Resources Expert Committee; the NSF board for the use of Human Resource data; the NSF Advance Study Panel; the National Academy of Sciences' studies on gender differences in careers of doctoral scientists and engineers, and on early careers of life scientists; and the Social Science Advisory of the National Center for Women and Information Technology for which she was co-chair. She was a founding associate editor of Gender & Society; and a twice elected member of Council of the American Sociological Association's Section on Science, Knowledge, and Technology, and was given an award as \\"Section Star.\\" Research Fox's research has introduced and established ways in which the participation and performance of women and men reflect and are affected by social and organizational features of science and academia. She has addressed these complex processes in a range of research encompassing education and educational programs, collaborative practices, salary rewards, publication productivity, social attributions and expectations, and academic careers‚Äîappearing in over 50 different journals, books, and collections. Her well-known and highly cited articles include \\"Publication Productivity Among Scientists\\" (1983), \\"Research, Teaching, and Publication Productivity: Mutuality versus Competition\\" (1992), \\"Scientific Careers: Universalism and Particularism,\\" with J. S. Long (1995), \\"Women, Science, and Academia: Graduate Education and Careers\\" (2001), and \\"Gender, Family Characteristics, and Publication Productivity\\" (2005). Contributions to sociology of science Fox devoted many years of her work to the sociology of science being one of the founders of the subfield of gender, science, and academia. Using Merton's (1961/1973) concept of \\"strategic research sites,\\" she has argued that science and academia are \\"strategic research sites\\" for studies of gender and inequality. Both gender relations and science are hierarchically structured. Gender hierarchy is constituted by processes where men and women are \\"differentially ranked and evaluated\\" (Fox, 2004) and science \\"reflects and reinforces gender stratification\\" (Fox, 1999, 2001, 2007). In her studies of scientific indicators, she demonstrated stratification of academia by field, gender, rank, and publication productivity. In her studies of scientific education, careers, and workplaces, she identified social and organizational characteristics of work that relate to participation, publication productivity, and performance in science and academia.

It is similar to the liar paradox. Unlike the liar paradox, which uses a single sentence, this paradox uses an infinite list of sentences, each referring to sentences occurring further down the list. Analysis of the list shows that there is no consistent way to assign truth values to any of its members. Since everything on the list refers only to later sentences, Yablo claims that his paradox is \\"not in any way circular\\". However, Graham Priest disputes this.  Statement  Consider the following infinite set of sentences: : S1: For each i > 1, Si is not true. : S2: For each i > 2, Si is not true. : S3: For each i > 3, Si is not true. : ...  Analysis  Assume that there is an n such that Sn is true. Then Sn + 1 is not true, so there is some k > n + 1 such that Sk is true. But Sk is not true because Sn is true and k > n. Assuming Sn to be true implies a contradiction: some later Sk is both true and not true. So our assumption is absurd, and we must conclude that for each i, the sentence Si is not true. But if each Si is not true, then given that each attributes untruth to later sentences, they are all true. So we have the paradox that each sentence in Yablo's list is true and not true.

He served as a battalion commander in World War II, and again later during the Korean War, where he was killed in action while commanding the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. He was the youngest battalion commander in the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), and was reputed to have been one of the Australian Army's better unit-level commanders. Early life Born on 26 December 1919 at Grafton, New South Wales, Charles Green was the second of three children to Hercules John Green and Bertha de Ville, and was raised at Swan Creek. He attended school at Swan Creek Public School and Grafton High School. In 1933, he began working for his father on the family dairy farm; during this time he also undertook odd jobs ploughing and building roads. He also became a cricketer and horseman of some note. On 28 October 1936, at the age of 16, he enlisted in the 41st Battalion, a part-time Militia infantry unit. By 1938 he had been promoted to sergeant, before later being commissioned as a lieutenant in March 1939. World War II With the outbreak of World War II, Green volunteered for overseas service and enlisted in the 2nd AIF on 13 October 1939. He was subsequently posted to the 2/2nd Battalion, which was one of the first units raised upon the outbreak of the war and formed part of the 16th Brigade that was assigned to the 6th Division. The 2/2nd Battalion was deployed to the Middle East in February 1940; however, after accidentally injuring himself, Green missed out on taking part in 6th Division's first combat action, which took place during the North African campaign between December 1940 and January 1941. In March he was promoted to captain, and the following month the battalion was committed to Greece to repel a German invasion. During the fighting that followed Green saw action at Pineios Gorge on 18 April. The British and Commonwealth forces were quickly overwhelmed by the larger German forces, and in the subsequent retreat Green evaded capture by undertaking a hazardous journey through the Aegean Islands, through Turkey, to Palestine, which he reached on 23 May. During his time in Greece, Green's presence as well his ability to connect with the soldiers under his command endeared him to his men who followed him unquestioningly. This was noted by his peers, and he was marked down for quick promotion. After reforming in Palestine, Green's battalion then was sent to undertake garrison duties in Syria and Ceylon, before finally returning to Australia in August 1942. Having injured his foot and contracting typhoid while in Ceylon, when the 2/2nd was sent to New Guinea, Green was again unable to join them. In December, having been substantively promoted to major in September, he was posted as an instructor to the First Army's Junior Tactical School in Southport, Queensland. He married Edna Olwyn Warner at St Paul's Anglican Church, Ulmarra, New South Wales, on 30 January 1943. Throughout 1943‚Äì1944, Green was posted to the Land Headquarters Tactical School where he filled another instructional position before undertaking the senior officers' tactical course. In December 1944, he deployed to Aitape, New Guinea, as the 6th Division took over responsibility for the area from US forces. On 9 March 1945 Green was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel and given command of the 2/11th Battalion; at the age of only 25 he was the youngest Australian battalion commander during the war. The battalion then took part in the attack on Wewak and operations around Boram during 1945. Conditions were difficult, and during the early part of the campaign supply lines were constantly raided by the Japanese causing difficulty with rations and creature comforts. Later the battalion suffered significant casualties, but still Green managed to maintain morale and efficiency‚Äîall objectives assigned to the unit during the campaign were achieved. As a result, he was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Post World War II After being discharged from the 2nd AIF on 23 November 1945, Green was placed on the Reserve of Officers List. He returned to Grafton where he worked at the Producers' Co-operative Distributing Society Ltd and studied accountancy. During this time he and his wife had a daughter, Anthea. When Australia's part-time military force was re- raised in April 1948 under the guise of Citizens Military Forces, Green returned to the 41st Battalion, serving as its commanding officer. With the establishment of the Regular Army, Green returned to full-time military service on 6 January 1949. In 1950 he was selected to attend Staff College at Fort Queenscliff. Korean War Green (right) with Brigadier Basil Coad, commander of 27th British Commonwealth Brigade, at Taegu, Korea, on 28 September 1950. After the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) was committed to the Korean War, Green was appointed the commanding officer in September 1950 and left Staff College early to take up this appointment. After only two weeks training in Japan, the battalion was sent to Korea where it formed part of 27th British Commonwealth Brigade. Leading the battalion with distinction through the battles at Yongju, Kujin, and Chongju, on 30 October 1950, the day after the fighting at Chongju, Green was severely wounded by a shell burst while resting in his tent when Chinese artillery struck 3 RAR's position. He was evacuated for medical attention, but could not be saved, dying the next day in a nearby US Army Mobile Army Surgical Hospital at Anju. He was buried in the United Nations Memorial Cemetery in Pusan, South Korea, and posthumously awarded the US Silver Star in 1951.

It means \\"taking side with\\" or \\"imitation of\\", and is often used to describe philosophies, theories, religions, social movements, artistic movements and behaviors. The suffix \\"-ism\\" is neutral and therefore bears no connotations associated with any of the many ideologies it identifies; such determinations can only be informed by public opinion regarding specific ideologies. The concept of an -ism may resemble that of a grand narrative.  History  The first recorded usage of the suffix ism as a separate word in its own right was in 1680. By the nineteenth century it was being used by Thomas Carlyle to signify a pre-packaged ideology. It was later used in this sense by such writers as Julian Huxley and George Bernard Shaw. In the United States of the mid-nineteenth century, the phrase \\"the isms\\" was used as a collective derogatory term to lump together the radical social reform movements of the day (such as slavery abolitionism, feminism, alcohol prohibitionism, Fourierism, pacifism, Technoism, early socialism, etc.) and various spiritual or religious movements considered non-mainstream by the standards of the time (such as Transcendentalism, spiritualism or \\"spirit rapping\\", Mormonism, the Oneida movement often accused of \\"free love\\", etc.). Southerners often prided themselves on the American South being free from all of these pernicious \\"Isms\\" (except for alcohol temperance campaigning, which was compatible with a traditional Protestant focus on individual morality). So on September 5 and 9, 1856, the Examiner newspaper of Richmond, Virginia ran editorials on \\"Our Enemies, the Isms and their Purposes\\", while in 1858 \\"Parson\\" Brownlow called for a \\"Missionary Society of the South, for the Conversion of the Freedom Shriekers, Spiritualists, Free-lovers, Fourierites, and Infidel Reformers of the North\\" (see The Freedom-of-thought Struggle in the Old South by Clement Eaton). In the present day, it appears in the title of a standard survey of political thought, Today's Isms by William Ebenstein, first published in the 1950s, and now in its 11th edition. In 2004, the Oxford English Dictionary added two new draft definitions of -isms to reference their relationship to words that convey injustice: *\\"Forming nouns with the sense 'belief in the superiority of one‚Äîover another'; as racism, sexism, speciesism, etc.\\" *\\"Forming nouns with the sense 'discrimination or prejudice against on the basis of‚Äî'; as ageism, bodyism, heightism, faceism, lookism, sizeism, weightism, etc.\\" Merriam-Webster Dictionary declared in December 2015, this word -ism to be the Word of the Year. A suffix is the Word of the Year because a small group of words that share this three-letter ending triggered both high volume and significant year-over-year increase in lookups at Merriam-Webster.com. Taken together, these seven words represent millions of individual dictionary lookups.

She has toured with Lionel Richie, David Crosby of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young and worked closely with Ike and Tina Turner. She is also the co-author and voice of the ongoing children's audio book series, Los Diggities, written about three rescued dogs living in Los Angeles (first published in 2010). Seven cds of her music have been released on both domestic and international labels, as well as 2 performance DVDs. Her music has also been heard worldwide from 1986 to present, as part of several high- profile product campaigns, with corporations such as Mitsubishi, Epson, Yamaha, Toshiba, and Chevron being among the many to utilize her original works. Being anonymously responsible for a number of musical wakeup broadcasts to Space Shuttle astronauts from NASA's mission control during the late 1980s through the early 90s, earned Cunningham the nickname, \\"The Most Flown Unknown\\". Known for her leadership in the struggle for gay rights (with particular emphasis on Christianity and its role in the LGBT community) Cunningham released a controversial Christian album, (Come As You Are...To The Father) on the internet for free in 2000, making her the first recording artist to ever release an entire album/cd, including graphics and karaoke versions‚Äîdownloadable for free‚Äîto the world via the internet. In 2002, Cunningham was commissioned to write, record and perform a tribute song to the United States in commemoration of the September 11 attacks for the country of Aruba. The song, \\"We Will Remember\\" has since been used to commemorate Memorial Day, Veterans Day and Pearl Harbor Day memorials as well as 9-11, making it a 21st-century anthem. In 2014, multi-media artist Steve Maloney commissioned Cunningham to write a song commemorating the Vietnam War veteran for Maloney's \\"Take Me Home Huey\\" project. The project involved taking a Huey helicopter that had been shot down in Vietnam and brought back to the U.S., rebuilding it (through a partnership with Lighthorse Legacy), then turning it into a colorful sculpture to facilitate dialogue for Vietnam veterans and raise awareness and funds for Post Traumatic Stress. In addition to the helicopter and song, a documentary film was made of the project, going by the same title of Take Me Home Huey, which won the 2016 Palm Springs Film Festival‚Äôs Mercedes Benz Audience Favorite award and has since been aired nationally on PBS in conjunction with the Ken Burns The Vietnam War series. In November 2017 the song earned Cunningham Congressional recognition from Congressman Mark Amodei of Nevada. The documentary also won an Emmy for Best Arts in 2018. Cunningham was also the recipient of the 2016 For the Children Inspiration Award presented by Opera Arts & The Steinway Society of Riverside County, California in recognition for her work designing and implementing a curriculum of Ukulele Instruction for elementary school children of the Coachella Valley, California. Combining forces with the Steinway Society to develop approaches to teaching music in schools, Cunningham is still involved with educating the next generation of musicians.  Biography  Early life Born in Los Angeles, Jeanie Cunningham was adopted into a military family at the age of 3 weeks, following an experimental surgery on her severely clubbed left foot that would hopefully make it possible for her to walk. It would be 2 more surgeries later in her childhood before she would be able to walk without a limp, but the early impressions of being physically challenged stayed with her throughout her life. Jeanie and her brother Caleb (also adopted) bounced from city to city as children, following the marching orders of their father, an officer in the United States Marine Corps. Wearing a leg brace and walking with a pronounced limp, Jeanie had to endure the taunts of other school children with every move her family made. She attributes this childhood challenge as being a key component to developing her comedic humor and performance capabilities. The taunts of the children ended quickly once they discovered Jeanie's talents and she would often entertain them with original songs that either voiced dissent over faculty members or anti-war sentiments shared by youth in the turbulent 1960s. She composed her first song at the age of eight, strumming the tune on a homemade cardboard and rubber-band guitar. At age eleven, she was given a series of I.Q. tests as well as musical aptitude tests. She scored relatively high in I.Q. (132), but even higher in music. Disregarding what was then determined as Jeanie's \\"prodigious musical talent\\", her parents didn't allow her formal music instruction and as a consequence, she never learned how to read or write music notation. Despite the lack of formal musical training, Cunningham taught herself to play the ukulele, then guitar, then piano and other instruments. She attributes the \\"musical inconvenience\\" of not being able to read notation as being key to her developing her songwriting skills, noting that if she couldn't easily play someone else's music, she would create her own. Her pursuit of a musical career took a front seat when, while as a boarding student attending The American School In Switzerland, a teenage Cunningham went AWOL (absent without leave) for 3 days to see Ike & Tina Turner perform in concert. Faced with 2 weeks suspension when she returned to school, she took it in stride because, as she later put it, \\"The night I saw Tina Turner, it was like a burning bush from God. I knew I was destined to meet her.\\" (The school, in spite of Cunningham's lack of musical knowledge, later went on to present her with the annual Excellence in Music Award in 1975, and subsequently named her an \\"honored alumna\\" 35 years later as a result of her considerable achievements in music composition and performance). Following graduation in 1975, Cunningham returned to Los Angeles and hooked up with Ike & Tina Turner. A few years later, Turner's performance of one of Cunningham's co-written songs, \\"I Can Take A Little Bit Of Pain\\" on The Tonight Show, earned the newcomer her professional songwriting credentials. Career Jeanie \\"JaeCie\\" Cunningham performing in 2009 After touring internationally with the all-female band The Cherries, Cunningham began building her own recording studio, Resnik-One (named after astronaut Judith Resnik who died in the Challenger disaster), in Los Angeles. During this time, she also attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, developing her acting skills with the intention of one day performing in musical theatre. But the skills she had developed as a musician and composer ultimately won out and she soon found herself on the road with other acts. Between tours as a guitarist with Lionel Richie's band and as an opening act for David Crosby, Cunningham continued to hone her skills as a songwriter, including writing for high-profile international corporations. Hired to write songs for everything from \\"toilet seat covers to secret sauce\\", Cunningham continued to develop her abilities in composition while developing considerable production and arrangement skills in the process. Her performances as a solo artist have taken her around the world, from Beijing to Cairo, as well as much of Europe and the U.S. with her band, JaeCie. Cunningham recorded 7 different albums (on almost as many record labels) both nationally and internationally. Described as a \\"happy collision between Sheryl Crow and Anastacia\\" by a Texan disc jockey, Jeanie's music embraces a wide variance of styles, with R&B; and folk music being the backbone behind her sound. In addition to her ongoing pursuits as a solo recording artist and \\"custom-songwriter\\", Cunningham began developing a new TV show called The Composers' Corner in 2003, dedicated to \\"interviewing musicians by musicians, exploring new gadgets and techniques, dissecting songs, and giving the viewer a window into the world of music creation\\". In 2007, The Composers Corner moved to the internet with its own website dedicated to the education of music to those who are interested in pursuing it as a career. In 2007, after a six-year dedicated effort, Cunningham completed 23 compositions for her first musical, DULA (from the play written by Paul Elliott), which gives a detailed and dramatic history of the folk-song legend Tom Dooley, and how an innocent man was hung for a crime he did not commit in the years immediately following the Civil War. Its first staged reading was performed at Northwestern University in 2012 and the world premiere of the full production took place at the Oh Look! Performing Arts Center near Dallas, Texas in 2015. She has been seen performing at the Sommet Center in Nashville (2007) and the New Orleans Morial Convention Center (2008) with Shaklee Corporation CEO, Roger Barnett, himself a gifted pianist and composer. The two of them penned a song for the Shaklee Company, \\"You Can Have It All\\" which they recorded together in Hollywood's famous Cherokee Studios. That recording was the last recording ever made at Cherokee before it closed its doors after over 40 years. (Music Connection Article). In October 2015, Cunningham performed at the International Expo in Milan, Italy on behalf of her alma mater, the American School in Switzerland. She continues to remain active both as a performer and a teacher of \\"music composition with lyrical compatibility\\" and ukuleles to both school children and teachers. She and co-author Elisabeth Thormodsrud are published by Musikk-Husets Forlag A/S for their Norwegian Ukulele instruction textbook G√∏y Med Ukulele i Klasserommet. Personal life In 1973, Jeanie's adoptive mother, Joan Cunningham died of cirrhosis of the liver. Her adoptive father, Ralph Cunningham, remarried within 6 months of Joan's death, and by the end of that year, Jeanie and her brother Caleb were no longer living in his and his new wife's home. Jeanie later struck out on a personal quest to locate her biological family and discover her roots. It turned out that \\"the apple doesn't fall far from the tree\\", for in 1995 after a 20-year search, Cunningham finally located her biological parents. Her mother was Gladys Jane Swift, one of the earliest female TV news anchors in the country; Cunningham's father, David Gilmore Baldwin III, was a former World War II aviation hero, having twice won the Distinguished Flying Cross Award. He later went on to become a newspaper journalist, then a speechwriter for the American Medical Association and various politicians. Baldwin and Swift met while he was the Deputy Press Secretary for then Governor George Leader of Pennsylvania. Swift was the local news anchor for the Tri-Stateted States region. The two fell in love but David was still married although separated from his wife at the time. According to Baldwin, both he and Swift resisted intimacy due to his unresolved marital status, but on New Year's Eve 1955-56, the two celebrated the New Year with a one-time union that would produce a baby girl exactly nine months later. Unfortunately, the unexpected pregnancy took its toll on their relationship, and the potential for scandal forced Swift to leave her life in Pennsylvania behind. Determined to keep the pregnancy secret, she and her mother took a train cross-country to Los Angeles where the two of them waited out the pregnancy. Gladys gave birth to Susan Swift on September 3, 1956 and put her up for adoption. Susan was later renamed Jean Akin Cunningham by her new adoptive parents 3 weeks later. Shortly after Susan and her mother headed to the West Coast, Baldwin returned to his wife Tite and the two of them together would raise their 2 sons, Geoff and Brooks, and ultimately celebrate their 50th anniversary before Baldwin died in 1997. From the first reunion and in spite of the prior history, Cunningham and Tite became very close friends, while Cunningham and her two half-brothers forged a new bond of sibling devotion. All three shared music and theatre in common, with Brooks being a graduate of Juilliard, and Geoff being a recording artist. While the reunion between father and daughter proved to be joyous, there was no such reunion between Cunningham and Swift. Cunningham did manage to contact Swift, but Swift wanted no part in the relationship and refused to see her. She later died in 2001, but not without informing her only son Peter (by her marriage to George Seibert who had died a number of years earlier), that he had a half sister named Jeanie. Leaving it at that, she kept the pictures and letter Cunningham sent in her desk where Peter was able to locate them after she died, and he ended up contacting Cunningham. The two of them met in Maryland and spent a week together on the Chesapeake Bay getting to know one another, clarifying all that had happened, and even meeting with former Governor George Leader, sharing in the news. Peter and Cunningham also formed a close relationship and, in spite of the addition of three more brothers, Cunningham still remains very close to her \\"original brother\\", Caleb and his family. Since 1994 she has also been the mentor, \\"tormentor\\" as she politely puts it, to four young men by the names of Peter, Pablo, Bryan, and Jonathan who are among what Cunningham considers to be \\"the greatest treasures\\" in her life. Helping them grow from \\"tweens\\" to \\"adults\\", she takes pride in their accomplishments and has been a vocal proponent to the cause of mentoring youth. A licensed pilot, Cunningham flies the skies herself in fixed-wing single-engine aircraft, as well as logging time in helicopters such as the Hughes 300 and the Bell Jetranger 206B. On the ground she enjoys golfing, hiking, bicycling and spending time with her longtime life companion (since 1981), and now, legal wife (since 2013), Margaret, step-daughter Mia, and grandson, Rodney.

Football career Spence was born in Rothesay on the Isle of Bute and started his football career on the Scottish mainland with St Mirren, before moving to England in 1897. After a brief spell at Derby County, Spence joined Gainsborough Trinity of the Football League Second Division in the summer of 1898. He spent one season with Gainsborough, generally playing at inside-right, when he made 26 league appearances, scoring ten goals. Spence then moved to Reading of the Southern League where he spent two seasons before returning to the Football League with Preston North End in May 1901. He spent the 1901‚Äì02 season at Preston, making 19 league appearances scoring seven goals. At the end of the season, Preston finished in third place, nine points behind Middlesbrough in the runners-up position. Spence then returned to Reading for a further season. In the 1903 close season, Spence moved to the Southern League champions, Southampton. At the \\"Saints\\", Spence was used very much as a utility player appearing in various positions either at half-back or as a forward, although he was generally played on the left. He made his debut for Southampton playing at left-half in a 3‚Äì0 victory at New Brompton on 12 September 1903. Described as \\"fast, tricky, clever and a glutton for work\\", Spence made a few appearances in the various forward positions over the next six months, but it was not until March 1904 that he became established in the side when he took over from Samuel Meston at left-half for the remainder of the season. At the end of the season, Spence helped the Saints retain the Southern League championship, before moving on to Hull City. Hull City were founded in June 1904 and were restricted to friendly matches, although they did enter the FA Cup in the preliminary round, where they were eliminated by Stockton after a replay, with Spence scoring twice, thus becoming Hull's \\"top-scorer\\" in competitive matches in the 1904‚Äì05 season. In 1905, Hull City were admitted to the expanded Football League Second Division. Spence had the honour of scoring Hull's first goal in the Football League, in a 4‚Äì1 victory over Barnsley on 2 September 1905. Hull finished their first league season in fifth place, with Spence having scored twice from 19 appearances, generally as an inside- forward. At the end of the season, Spence returned to Scotland and played out his career with Clyde and Cowdenbeath.

He served as Bishop of Cleveland from 1872 until his death in 1891. Biography Gilmour was born in Dumbarton, Scotland to John and Marian (n√©e Callander) Gilmour, who were Reformed Presbyterians. In 1829 he and his parents moved to Nova Scotia and later settled near Latrobe, Pennsylvania. He received his classical education in Philadelphia, where he became acquainted with Rev. Patrick Rafferty, pastor of St. Francis Xavier Church, Fairmount, Philadelphia. Gilmour's friendship with Rafferty eventually led Gilmour to convert to Catholicism in 1844, and he soon resolved to enter the priesthood. In 1846 he entered Mount St. Mary's Seminary in Emmitsburg, Maryland. In addition to his studies, Gilmour was named prefect of collegians and professor of mathematics in 1847. After receiving his Master of Arts degree (1848) and completing his theological studies, Gilmour was ordained a priest by Archbishop John Baptist Purcell on August 30, 1852. Gilmour then served as pastor of St. Mary's Church in Portsmouth, Ohio, also doing missionary work in Ironton, Gallipolis, Vinton, and Wilkesville. In 1857 he succeeded Rev. James Frederick Wood as pastor of St. Patrick's Church in Cincinnati, where Gilmour erected a parochial school. He briefly served as a professor at Mount St. Mary's Seminary of the West (1868‚Äì1869) before being named pastor of St. Joseph's Church in Dayton. On February 15, 1872, Gilmour was appointed the second Bishop of Cleveland by Pope Pius IX. He received his episcopal consecration on the following April 14 from Archbishop Purcell, with Bishops Augustus Toebbe and Caspar Henry Borgess serving as co-consecrators, at St. Peter's Cathedral. He founded The Catholic Universe newspaper in 1874, and successfully opposed attempts by the Cuyahoga County auditor to tax Catholic churches and schools. He was also wary of the public school system.Brownson's Quarterly Review (Last Series, Vol. 1, 1873, \\"The Church above the State\\", p. 353-354). Quote: \\"Catholics are too timid; they seem to go upon the principle that, if they are tolerated, they are doing well. This is a mistake; if we let our rights go by default, we should not wonder if we lose them. We must be decided in our demands, and present a bolder front to our enemies. It is unjust to so organize the public schools that we cannot in conscience send our children to them, and then tax us for their support. As well create a State Church, and tax us for its support.\\" He established St. Ann's Asylum and Maternity Home,\\"St. Ann's Hospital, Cleveland\\", The Catholic Church in the United States of America, Catholic Editing Company, 1914, p. 87 St. Michael Hospital, \\"St. Michael Hospital\\", Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University and St. John Hospital.
