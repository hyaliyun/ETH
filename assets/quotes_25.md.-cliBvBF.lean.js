Thomas Campbell, who served a partial term in 1917 and had his election overturned by the Supreme Court of Arizona, returned to contest the Governors office. Incumbent Governor Hunt declined to run again after the stress of the close elections and the year-long court battle. Despite falling to its lowest percentage in years, the sole third party challenger held the difference between the two candidates. The Democratic challenger was state senator Fred T. Colter, a pro-Hunt Democrat. Thomas Campbell was sworn in for his first full term on January 6, 1919. Democratic primary Candidates *Fred Tuttle Colter, State Senator, member of the 1910 Arizona Constitutional Convention. *Fred Sutter, State Senator. Only primary candidate that earned the hostility of Governor George Hunt. *Sidney Preston Osborn, incumbent Secretary of State, future Governor. Race In early 1918, Sutter, who was one of two sitting State Senators from Cochise County, was approached by leaders of the Democratic party to consider running in the Democratic primary for the governorship. In February, the other sitting senator from Cochise, C. M. Roberts, announced his intention to run for the Democratic nod for Governor. Sid Osborne also announced his attention to seek the Democratic nomination in February, as did Fred Colter, the state senator from Apache County. Benjamin Baker Moeur announced his intention to run for the Democratic nomination in mid-February. On July 20, 1918, the last day to do so, Colter officially entered the gubernatorial race when he filed his petition with the Arizona Secretary of State. On the final day, Lamar Cobb added his name to the list of Democratic primary candidates, bringing the total to five. In mid-August, in an effort to consolidate the conservative arm of the Democratic party in an attempt to thwart Colter's candidacy, Moeur withdrew from the race, asking his supporters to throw their support behind Osborn. Shortly thereafter, also in August, Cobb also withdrew from the race. This left only three candidates to run in the Democratic primary: Osborn, Sutter and Colter. On September 10, early returns showed Sutter with a slight lead over Colter. With only 29 of 82 statewide precincts counted, Sutter had 772 votes to Colter's 755, with Osborn a distant third with 71. However. by the time 79 precincts had tallied their votes, Colter had pulled into a commanding lead, with the three final precincts to be counted being small. Colter won the Democratic primary in September 1918, garnering 44% of the total votes, 14,539 to Sutter's 10,108 and Osborn's 8,390. In doing so, he won 12 of Arizona's then 14 counties. It was felt that Osborn and Sutter split the anti-Hunt vote, which allowed Colter to win the nomination.

He was not formally educated but had read the works of Czech priests like Matthias of Janov and Jan Hus. Augusta joined the Unitas Fratrum in 1524 after exploring and rejecting other Christian communities. He was elected a bishop of the Unitas Fratrum in 1532 and in 1535 journeyed to Wittenberg, Germany on behalf of the Unity to consult with Martin Luther.C. Daniel Crews, Faith Love Hope: A History of the Unitas Fratrum (Winston-Salem: Moravian Archives, 2008), p. 190. Augusta was named the president of the Inner Council of the Unitas Fratrum in 1547.

Daniel Crews, Faith Love Hope: A History of the Unitas Fratrum (Winston-Salem: Moravian Archives, 2008), p. 200. He discouraged members of the Unitas Fratrum from cooperating with Ferdinand I during the Smalkaldic War. After the war was over, Ferdinand banished the whole sect and arrested the principal preachers. Augusta attempted to escape in the garb of a peasant, but was captured and taken in chains to Prague, where he was thrown into prison. He was offered his liberty on condition of making public recantation and becoming either a Catholic or an Utraquist. Augusta was ready to profess himself a Utraquist, but not to recant in public, and he accordingly remained in prison 16 years. He was imprisoned from 1548 to 1564, during which time he maintained correspondence with other leaders of the Unity but was reluctant to relinquish his leadership role to others but was reconciled to them following his release from prison on the death of Ferdinand. As a condition of his release, he had to promise not to preach any more.

This is a list of aircraft used by the Spanish Republican Air Force during the Spanish Civil War. Introduction Polikarpov I-16 'Mosca', one of the primary aircraft of the Spanish Republican Air Force during the Civil War. The Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed in 1931 and very soon the republican authorities set up to reform an antiquated military structure that was a financial burden for the Spanish state following the Great Depression.Ignacio Hidalgo de Cisneros, Cambio de Rumbo, Ed. Ikusager, Vitoria 2001, pg. 273 The Spanish Republican Air Force inherited a great number of airplanes from the monarchy, most of which had been used in the Spanish Campaigns in Northern Africa during general Primo de Rivera's dictatorship in the 1920s. Hostile to the republican reforms, and with many of its top echelon officers sympathizing with the far-right movements of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, part of the military elite staged a failed coup led by General Sanjurjo in 1934. However, the rebellion led by General Franco against the Spanish Republic in 1936 was more successful and marked the beginning of the Spanish Civil War.Juan Eslava Gal√°n, Una Historia de la Guerra Civil que no va a Gustar a Nadie, Ed. Planeta. 2005. p. 9-12 While more than half of the aircraft of the Spanish Republican Air Force remained on the loyalist side, most of the material was obsolete. In the summer of 1936 the beleaguered Spanish Republic found itself direly in need of modern weapons, but the governments of the United Kingdom and France quickly led a policy of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War.Antony Beevor, The Battle for Spain: the Spanish Civil War 1936‚Äì1939, Weidenfeld & Nicolson In defiance of the non-intervention pact some aircraft were sent to Republican Spain from France thanks to the efforts of personalities supporting the republican cause, but these consisted mostly in old material, including trainers, transport aircraft and planes without weapons that could not be used for attacks. Owing to the international blockade against the republic other planes of dubious value were acquired by the republican government through various sources, including Mexico, the Netherlands, Belgium and Czechoslovakia which included a motley combination of obsolete aircraft, prototypes and almost discarded single models. Some of the shipments of aircraft did not make it to the Spanish fronts owing to the sinking of the merchant vessels transporting them or having been seized by the customs at the ports of origin.A.D.A.R. - El desarrollo aeron√°utico de los a√±os treinta y su influencia en la Guerra Civil Espa√±ola Armas en acci√≥n. Aviones de las Fuerzas A√©reas republicanas The most well-known Spanish Republican Air Force planes such as the 'Chato', 'Mosca', 'Natacha' and 'Katiuska' would come later in the same year and throughout 1937, when the USSR would decide to openly assist the Spanish Republic.Hugh Thomas, The Spanish Civil War; New revised edition (2011) Documents Information, both written and pictorial, regarding the identification of the aircraft of the Spanish Republican Air Force is found in a variety of sources. These include press reports of the time, official republican government documents, as well as documents and reports from the rebel side. Since republican aerodromes were restricted military areas, relatively few photographs are available. Most are pictures of aircraft taken with air force personnel posing near them in an informal way,Im√°genes de la Guerra Civil espa√±ola - FAREIm√°genes de personal de las Fuerzas A√©reas republicanas as well as photographs of crashed planes.Na ≈°panƒõlsk√©m nebi - Bl√©riot-SPAD S 51 a S 91Aviation Corner - Potez 540 (N) Except for the primary aircraft,ADAR - Los Aviones certain republican military plane types were never photographed, or if available, photographs have not been found, being only known from written documents or from pilot reports.

It is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lingayen-Dagupan. The parish church will celebrate its quadricentennial year in April 2019. Architectural history Father Manuel Mora built a wooden church, with 3 naves, and an old convent at the town of Bayambang in 1804. It was damaged by an earthquake in 1863. In 1869, a second church and convent was built from stone and mortar with galvanized iron roofing. Father Manuel Sucias rehabilitated the church with a cruciform plan in 1804. Father Manuel Sucias (1813-1824); Father Juan Alvarez del Manzano (1833-1835); Father Joaquin Flores; Father Benito Foncuberta (1836-1840); and Father Jose Iba√±ez (1836-1840) directed and supervised the gradual construction of the church. In 1856, the church was burned. The reconstruction of the church was administered by Father Benito Foncuberto who also built two sacristies and repair the tile roofing which was destroyed by the earthquakes. The galvanized iron roofing measures wide and long. Father Ciriaco Billote contributed a new church belfry for the reconstructed church. Architectural features View of the church nave and interior from the entrance. The present stone structures, with its galvanized iron roofs, already existed by 1869. The galvanized iron roofing of the church was heavily damaged during World War II. The church was also damaged during the July 16, 1990 earthquake; thus, making the bell tower a later addition within the church. The facade is in high renaissance style. It is divided into two levels with six Ionic columns on pedestals running the whole height of the lower level. The pediment was ornamented by statued niches symmetrically designed forming as the second level. The lower ends of the pediment are terminated by massive piers. The two levels are markedly divided by wide horizontal cornice. The main entrance is formed by an arch order with a square window above it. The bell tower on the left is a late addition which is in contrast with the high renaissance style of the church facade.

It is a sequel to Shakespeare's plays Henry IV, Part 2 and The Merry Wives of Windsor. Most of the characters are carried over from the two Shakespeare plays. The play was first staged in 1766, but was not a success. It was infrequently revived thereafter. The play exists in two quite different versions. The first version, published in 1760, is written in verse. Its main storyline involves an embittered Falstaff being drawn into a plot to kill Henry V of England. The second version, staged in 1766, drops the serious plot and expands the roles of the comic characters, becoming a farce about their plans to marry into money. It is mostly in prose with snatches of verse appended to the end of several scenes. First version Characters characters derived from The Merry Wives of Windsor are marked (MW); those from the Henry IV plays are marked (H.IV) *King Henry V *Duke of Gloucester *Duke of Bedford *Duke of Clarence *Duke of York *Duke of Exeter *Archbishop of Canterbury, *The Pope's Legate. *Lord Scroop of Masham. *The Earl of Cambridge. *Sir Thomas Grey. *Mithridate, a Doctor. *Sir John Falstaff - (MW);(H.IV) *Justice Shallow - (MW);(H.IV) *Abraham Slender - (MW) *Mr Pleadwell *Friar Lawrence *Friar Paul *Ancient Pistol (MW);(H.IV) *Bardolph - (MW);(H.IV) *Francis - (H.IV) *Peto - (H.IV) *Dame Ursula - (H.IV) *Eleanor Poins - (H. IV) *Mistress Quickly - (MW);(H.IV) *Doll Tearsheet - (H.IV) Plot Smarting from his dismissal from Hal's presence, Falstaff meets up with Doll Tearsheet and Mistress Quickly, who have bribed their way free of jail. They are both shocked by what has happened. Lord Scroop and his accomplices plot against the new king. Scroop says that Henry's rejection of his old companions is proof of how hypocritical and untrustworthy he is. A Friar is asked to try to reform Falstaff. The Friar is told that the king's relationship with Poins' beautiful sister Eleanor has helped Poins escape the fate of the other former companions. The king has sent Eleanor to a nunnery, nominally to protect her. But he is disturbed to see her at his coronation. Shallow plots to get back the thousand pounds he lent to Falstaff. In the Boar's Head Tavern, Falstaff pours out his bitterness to Bardolph. Shallow consults lawyer Mr. Pleadwell, but is advised that legal attempts to get his money will fail. Falstaff, Doll, Bardolph and Quickly discuss what they will do for the future. Scroop visits Eleanor Poins and attempts to seduce her, but she rejects him. An Apothecary visits the dejected Falstaff but can do nothing for him; Falstaff only perks up when Bardolph tells him that his old fianc√©e Mistress Ursula has inherited money. He writes to her, telling her of his enduring love. The king discusses challenges to his power from the church and the French. Ursula discusses Falstaff's intentions with her maid Bridget. The Friar confronts Falstaff about his lifestyle. Falstaff says marriage will be his penance. The king angers church leaders when he refuses a demand from the Pope to change a law that requires parliamentary approval for some church financial matters. Scroop and the Papal Legate plot against him. Shallow, frustrated, determines to challenge Falstaff to a duel. Scroop and the Earl of Cambridge plan to kill Henry and place Edmund Mortimer on the throne. They think Falstaff is the man to do the deed, because of his known criminality and his grievance against Henry. Falstaff and Shallow meet for their duel. Falstaff beats Shallow, who is forced to concede he will never get back his money. The Friar learns from Eleanor of Scroop's behaviour. Scroop appears. He attempts to rape Eleanor, but is overpowered by the friars. He leaves. The Friar reveals to Eleanor that he has discovered Scroop's plot against the king. Having agreed to kill the king, Falstaff waits for him at Southamption with the Earl of Cambridge. He ponders his options as, unaware of the plot, his new wife expresses excitement at the thought of meeting the king. The king hears from the friars about the plot, but remains unsure of the truth. He allows Falstaff an audience. Falstaff produces a knife, but then offers it to the king and tells him of the plot. The king leaves to find the conspirators. Alone Falstaff says that he knew the conspirators intended to hang him after he'd killed the king. The conspirators arrive, but deny their guilt. Proof of their plan arrives, and they are led away. The king returns Falstaff to his favour. Falstaff says he is too old to join in the French war, and wishes only to retire - as long as the king will give him some more money. The king agrees. Second version Characters characters derived from The Merry Wives of Windsor are marked (MW); those from the Henry IV plays are marked (H.IV) *Sir John Falstaff - (MW);(H.IV) *Justice Shallow - (MW);(H.IV) *Abraham Slender - (MW) *Mr Pleadwell *Dr Caius - (MW) *Friar Lawrence *Ancient Pistol (MW);(H.IV) *Bardolph - (MW);(H.IV) *Corporal Nym - (MW) *Gadshill - (H.IV) *Officer *Francis - (H.IV) *Peto - (H.IV) *Dame Ursula - (H.IV) *Bridget (MW) *Mistress Quickly - (MW);(H.IV) *Doll Tearsheet - (H.IV) Plot Falstaff overpowers Shallow, illustration by Stodhart, engraved by James Heath Having been rejected by the new king Henry V, Falstaff and his cronies must find a new way to advance themselves. Doll Tearsheet and Mistress Quickly have bribed their way free of jail. Pistol tells Nym he intends to hide by using a false name. Falstaff still has the thousand pounds he borrowed from Shallow. Shallow consults Mr Pleadwell, a lawyer, about the money, but Pleadwell says that since no contract was drawn up for the loan, Shallow will have to rely on Falstaff's sense of honour. Shallow despairs of the money. At a fencing school, Pistol and Nym meet Shallow and Slender. Disguised as Spanish swordsman \\"Anticho del Pistolo\\", Pistol impresses Shallow with his swordsmanship. Convinced that he can use \\"Pistolo\\" against Falstaff, Shallow invites him and Nym to work for him. Nym has an idea that they can trick Shallow and Slender into believing that Doll and Quickly are two well-known wealthy women, whom they resemble. The women will then pretend to fall in love with the two squires, knowing that the greedy Shallow and Slender will seize the chance to marry them. Falstaff and Bardolph consult Dr Caius about Peto, who is very ill. Caius' track-record does not bode well for Peto. Bardolph informs Falstaff that Mistress Ursula, Falstaff's old fianc√©e, has come into money. Falstaff immediately plans to marry her at last. Doll and Quickly agree to Nym's plan. Meanwhile \\"Pistolo\\" sets out to woo Ursula for himself. Nym has already been pursuing her maid Bridget. Falstaff wins over Ursula, while Quickly and Doll adopt airs of demure gentility, convincing Shallow and Slender of their fake identities. Pistol attempts to impress Ursula, but is forced to flee when Falstaff approaches. A friar attempts to make Falstaff repent of his wayward ways with no success. Bardolph learns of Nym's deception plan. He informs Falstaff. Shallow challenges Falstaff to a duel, intending that \\"Pistolo\\" will do the fighting. Falstaff tries to get Bardolph to fight for him. When neither \\"Pistolo\\" nor Bardolph are willing to fight, the two old men are forced to fight the duel themselves. Shallow repeatedly stabs Falstaff but fails to penetrate his body, breaking his sword. Falstaff captures Shallow. He agrees to release him if he will say they are quits. When Shallow agrees, Falstaff tells him about Nym's marriage plot. The pair devise a plan to outwit the plotters. Shortly afterwards Pistol receives a letter, apparently from Ursula, saying that she wants to marry him rather than Falstaff. Bridget will marry Nym. By contriving that the marriage will be at a masquerade, Shallow and Slender manage to switch places with Pistol and Nym, who marry Quickly and Doll. Falstaff marries Ursula. The deceptions are revealed. Pistol, Quickly, Doll and Nym accept their fate, and Falstaff invites everyone to the marriage feast. Creation and productions Kenrick was a well known commentator on Shakespeare in the 18th century, who took the common view at the time that Shakespeare's plays were only acceptable to modern audiences in heavily adapted versions.Stern, Tiffany, \\"Shakespeare in Drama\\", in Ritchie & Sabor (eds), Shakespeare in the Eighteenth Century, Cambridge University Press, 19 Apr 2012, pp.141-61. Falstaff's Wedding contains very little directly derived from Shakespeare apart from a few phrases and the characters themselves. The ending of the second version, however, is a pastiche of the final scene of The Merry Wives of Windsor. The play was one of several adaptations of Shakespeare centring on the character of Falstaff, but is \\"the most remarkable\\" of them according to critic Adam Hansen.Hanson, Adam, \\"introduction\\", Shakespeare, William, The Second Part of King Henry IV, Cambridge University Press, 2007, pp.39-40. Hansen describes the first version of the play as \\"an ingenious exploitation of some hints and inconsistencies in the Shakespearean original\\". In particular Kenrick picks up on the hint that Hal has a relationship with Poins' sister, who is portrayed in Falstaff's Wedding as the king's \\"quondam mistress\\". After the first version was published in 1760, Kenrick was encouraged to adapt it into a viable performance version. He wrote that, The revised version is almost a completely different play. Eleanor Poins and all the upper class characters are dropped, including the conspirators. Only a minority of scenes remain unchanged. A wholly new story centring on Nym's plans for Doll and Quickly was created. Thus the earlier version, described as a sequel to Henry IV, Part 2, is mimicking the manner of the Henriad plays, but the second version is much more indebted to The Merry Wives of Windsor. The original version of the play was dedicated to the best-known Falstaff of the era James Quin. When the revised version was performed in 1766, the title role was played by James Love, who was also a well-known Falstaff.Broadbent, R. J., Annals of the Liverpool Stage, from the Earliest Period to the Present Time, 1908, p.70. It was performed the following year in Liverpool. Though the revised version was not a success on stage, the original version was popular in print and widely reprinted.Lynch, Jack, Becoming Shakespeare: The Unlikely Afterlife That Turned a Provincial Playwright into the Bard, Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2009, p.131. Kendrick later complained that David Garrick had tried to stop productions of the play.Brewer, David A., The Afterlife of Character, 1726-1825, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011, pp.88-9. In his poem Roscius a character based on Garrick says of him \\"Ne'er shall his Falstaff come again to life\\". Significance Though not a major success, the play was very significant in the process of expanding the imaginary world created in Shakespeare's Henry IV plays, especially by creating the characters of Eleanor Poins and Mistress Ursula, both of whom are only mentioned in passing in the original. David A. Brewer refers to this as \\"detachability with a vengeance\\", in which characters take on a life of their own detached from the original dramatic context. The play represents Falstaff's cronies breaking out of their restricted roles. The play was an influence on James White's Falstaff's Letters (1796), originally entitled Original Letters, etc, of Sir John Falstaff and his friends. White's friend Charles Lamb considered it to be \\"full of goodly quips and rare fancies, 'all deftly masked like hoar antiquity' ‚Äî much superior to Dr. Kenrick's Falstaff 's Wedding.\\"Talfourd, Thomas Noon, Life and Letters of Charles Lamb, Willis, Philadelphia, 1856, p.18.

When Teos went to the Near East leading a military expedition against the Achaemenid Empire, he left Tjahapimu in Egypt as his regent. However, Tjahapimu took advantage of Teos' unpopularity in Egypt, which was due to the harsh tax regime that the pharaoh imposed in order to finance his expedition. Tjahapimu convinced his own son Nakhthorheb, who was serving Teos as the commander of the machimoi, to rebel against him and to rise as pharaoh himself. His plan was successful: Nakhthorheb (Nectanebo II) was acclaimed pharaoh and Teos fled at Susa to the court of the Great King.

The first version was executed in 1937 for the International Surrealist Exhibition in Paris, 1938) Nuage articul√© (Articulated cloud) is a surrealist object in the form of an assemblage by Wolfgang Paalen produced in 1937. The object consists of an umbrella covered with natural sponges and was one of the most significant objects at the Exposition Internationale du Surr√©alisme, which was held in Paris at the Wildenstein Gallery in 1938. It was also exhibited in numerous later exhibitions, such as Amsterdam (1938), Cambridge (1938) and Mexico City (1940). Many photographers have captured the item in its context, Man Ray, Kurt Husnik, Josef Breitenbach and Denise Bellon.  Description  The object consists of a standard black umbrella covered with flat-cut, dry natural sponges which are glued onto the fabric surfaces, the clamp and handle of the umbrella. The dimensions are 66 x 94 cm.  History  The original definition of the surrealist object art comes from the French poet Comte de Lautr√©amont. In his poem Les Chants de Maldoror he describes the beauty of the young man Mervyn using antipodal metaphors: \\"He is as beautiful (..) as the chance encounter of a sewing machine and an umbrella on a dissecting table\\". In 1937 the French editor Gallimard prepared the publication of the collected works of Lautr√©amont in an illustrated luxury edition, and Andr√© Breton invited besides other artists also Paalen to contribute with an illustration Breton selected (from two proposals) the drawing Vieil oc√©an (old Ocean), which was published in the Gallimard edition next to the appropriate text.Comte de Lautr√©amont, Oeuvres compl√®tes, Paris 1938, p. 24 The umbrella was always a strong metaphor in the imagery of surrealism: After a rainy day in the year 1930, he ran as congenial symbol of masculine-surrealist fury for many years ‚Äì in front of a cinema Andr√© Breton had torn an umbrella from the hand of a smaller passer-by, because he had nearly hit the great Breton in his eyes. The poet broke the umbrella over his knee, which the friends Desnos, Pr√©vert, Tanguy, P√©ret and Duhamel imitated, to do the same with other passers-by. The subsequent turmoil created the typical group euphoria which generated the emotional satisfaction that Breton was a matter of the heart. Drawing of the object Nuage articul√©, created by Wolfgang Paalen in 1937 In the autumn of 1937, Breton began \\"during dinner-meetings with a limited number of participants after or before the usual meetings\\"Georges Hugnet, Pleins et d√©li√©s, La Chapelle sur Loire 1972, p. 39 to exchange opinions and suggestions on the proposed Exposition Internationale du Surr√©alisme, as well as to prepare the catalogue. Although Paalen was helped by his sister-in-law Geo Dupin at work, Nuage articul√© was not ready prior to printing of the catalogue Dictionnaire abr√©g√© you surr√©alisme; Breton, who particularly liked the object, published a project- drawing of Paalen. Whether Paalen brought the half-finished screen to a discrete private meeting in a smaller circle or just told the friends of it we do not know. Even the mere possibility, Paalen would eroticize the reality of the umbrella dialectically, will have certainly caused a stir, and as it was abundantly clear that a male-female union would be carried out here, all eyes were on reception. The umbrella as such embodied apart from its obvious phallic meaning, a masculine mean against the perils of nature and existence and was suddenly on everyone's lips. Paalen's proposal of a physical feminization was initially almost overlooked ‚Äì the sponge cover feeds in moisture, has cleaned and touched naked woman's skin and still remained nature, and the opening of the sponge screen was suddenly the calyx as fertilizing stamen. The screen, however, was felt in the surrealist context primarily as a symbolic threat against bad weather. Marcel Duchamp's friend Henri-Pierre Roch√© reported that Duchamp was once asked by Breton, \\"to create a new ceiling for the large main room of the exhibition\\", and had the spontaneous idea, \\"to cover it with hundreds of open umbrellas with their tops down\\".Henri-Pierre Roch√©, \\"Souvenirs of Marcel Duchamp\\", in Robert Lebel, Marcel Duchamp, Cologne 1959: p. 84 It became only clear at the last moment, that it would be impossible to find that many umbrellas in the short term. Duchamp borrowed an open coal stove and a whole truckload of used coal-sacks from a coal merchant from La Villette, which he filled with newspaper and hung over the coal stove instead of the umbrellas.Who originally had idea to the umbrella will not be cleared exhaustively, although it remains doubtful whether Paalen would have put so much effort into making his screen when it would have been clear from the beginning that this would otherwise hang with hundreds on the ceiling. Nuage articul√© then hang from the ceiling of the rear side room where also stood Paalen's object Pot√®nce avec paratonn√®rre (gallows with lightning rods). See Annabelle Goergen, Exposition internationale du Surr√©alisme Paris 1938 , Munich 2008, p. 130f.  Reception  The erotic connotations of Nuage articul√©, with its umbrella covered with natural sponges, embodied a dynamic sense of contradiction: bloom with stalk; sponge as symbol of nature, as a feminine utensil, which touched and cleaned naked female skin; umbrella as a masculine symbol of order and protection from natural forces. It thus became widely recognized among the Surrealists and their growing public. Geo Dupin, Paalen's sister-in-law, remembered that Alfred H. Barr, Jr. had been extremely taken with Paalen's object and had chosen not to buy it, for the Museum of Modern Art in New York, only because it was too fragile and difficult to transport.Andreas Neufert, Conversations with Geo Dupin, Paris 1987, see also Neufert (2014), p. 300ff. Nuage articul√© was published later in a more political context in the Surrealist magazine London Bulletin, together with a text by Andr√© Breton translated by Samuel Beckett with acomment that the sponge-umbrella would bring to mind another, sadly prominent, umbrella-that of Neville Chamberlain at the 1938 Munich Conference and the failure of the British policy of appeasement.Mesens, E. L. T., (ed), London Bulletin (Feb. 1939), No. 10  Versions and presentation  In 1938, the object was presented mostly hanging from the ceiling, 1940 Paalen opted for a museum-like presentation on a pedestal. Two versions have been preserved: The first one with eight segments, Nuage articul√© (1937/38), was kept by Geo Dupin and sold in the 1970s to the Moderna Museet, Stockholm, bought by the Swedish art historian Pontus Hult√©n, where it is still visible today. The second one with 10 segments, Nuage articul√© II (1939/40) was executed by Paalen after his arrival in Mexico in September 1939 for the International Surrealist Exhibition in Mexico City (opening January 1940), as due to the war objects from Paris could not be shipped. It was kept by Ines Amor, the owner of the Galeria de Arte Mexicano, who had organized the exhibition in 1940, was restored in 1956 by Paalen and is now in a private collection in Berlin. It was exhibited recently several times: 2011 in the Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt (exhibition Surreale Dinge),Ingrid Pfeiffer and Max Hollein (eds.), Surreale Dinge, Skulpturen und Objekte von Dal√≠ bis Max Ernst, Frankfurt 2011, p. 262f., reproduced p. 210f. 2012 in the Mjellby Konstmuseum, Halmstad (exhibition Surrealistiska ting),Karolina Peterson (ed.), Surrealistiska ting, Halmstad 2012, p. 24 (repr.) 2013 in the Centre Pompidou, Paris (exhibition Le surr√©alisme et l'objet)Didier Ottinger (ed.), Dictionnaire de l'objet surr√©aliste, Paris (Gallimard) 2013, reproduced p. 202 and 2018 in the Nationalgalerie Berlin, Hamburger Bahnhof ‚Äì Museum f√ºr Gegenwart (Exhibition Hello World - Revision einer Sammlung).

This was made by Goodbrand of Manchester to measure cotton. A wrap reel or skein winder is a device for measuring yarn and making it into hanks of a standard size.. The reel is of a standard size and its revolutions are counted as the yarn is wrapped around it. Typically, a set number of revolutions will be used so that the hank is of a standard size ‚Äî a skein or lea. For example, a skein of cotton would be 80 turns on a reel of 54 inches circumference, making 120 yards, while the standard length for wool worsted would be 80 yards. The tension of the yarn as it was wound onto the reel was important because it would be elastic and so a standard tension was required to ensure uniformity. For a given reel, this would be determined by the friction of the setup and so the test hanks would be made and measured in other ways to calibrate the device.

Its name is a reference to chicha, a corn-based liquor that has been produced in South America since the time of the Incas. It is also the name of a Peruvian musical genre (also known as Peruvian cumbia) on which the band's music is based. History Conan was first introduced to chicha music on a trip to Peru in 2005. Their first album, ¬°Sonido Amazonico!, was released in 2008 on Barbes Records, a label which Conan runs from his home in Brooklyn. They released their second album, Canibalismo, in 2012, and an EP, Cuatro Tigres, in 2013, both digitally and on vinyl. The band's original members were Olivier Conan (lead vocalist, cuatro), Josh Camp (DuoVox, keyboards, background vocals), Vincent Douglas (guitar), Greg Burrows (percussion, background vocals, timbales, bongos, guiro, reco-reco), Timothy Quigley (percussion, bongo, shakers, conga) and Nick Cudahy (bass guitar). Additional members are Neil Ochoa (congas) and Karina Colis (timbales). Featured guest artists have included Jose Carballo (a former member of the seminal Peruvian chicha band, Los Hijos del Sol). Style The band's music is based on chicha, a fusion of rock and roll and cumbia produced by the native population of the Peruvian Andes and Amazon. This music was most popular in the 1960s and 1970s in northern Peru. Conan has described his band's music as \\"free-form Chicha\\" and has said they take many liberties with chicha music. Reception Sonido Amazonico received a favorable review from Brendon Griffin in PopMatters. Griffin wrote that \\"...like the best music of any genre it leaves you wondering about the mystery of it all\\" and gave the album a rating of 9 out of 10. Jon Lusk wrote on the BBC's website that the album's music was \\"too self- conscious and contrived to match the fevered originals\\".

To prevent this from happening, she creates a bucket list filled with things to accomplish before high school. * Jaheem King Toombs as Fenwick Frazier, a seventh grader who became CJ's first friend in kindergarten.

He became the coolest boy in the whole school, causing the most popular girl in the school to constantly try to get his affections, which becomes a running gag in the series. Nevertheless, he is also loyal, and while he does not have much common sense, his heart is in the right place, and he just wants to have fun with his two best friends as much as he can. * Jack De Sena as Jack Roberts, the school's guidance counselor, who often helps the three with their list and gives them advice.

Facts Mrs Thompson slipped on a ramp while disembarking a train operated by London, Midland and Scottish Railway at 10pm, from Manchester to Darwen, and was injured. The train had pulled up just past the platform, and so the ramp she stepped out on was slippery. A special jury found the railway to have been negligent, and so Mrs Thompson sought damages for personal injury. She had been given an excursion ticket by her niece, which said ‚ÄòExcursion. For conditions see back‚Äô which in turn referred to the Railway‚Äôs timetables and excursion bills. The timetables could be bought for sixpence said the tickets were issued on condition that holders ‚Äòshall have no rights of action against the company .... in respect of .... injury (fatal or otherwise) .... however caused.‚Äô A jury found that the company had not taken reasonable steps to bring the conditions to the notice of Mrs Thompson and awarded damages. But then the judge, as a matter of law, held that when the ticket was accepted the contract was complete, and so the jury was not entitled to find as they did. Mrs Thompson could not read. Judgment Lord Harnworth MR held that, regardless of whether Mrs Thompson could read, she was bound by the contract, and the indication of further conditions by reference was sufficient notice.

Most of the PIN proteins (e.g. PIN1/2/3/4/7 in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana) localize at the plasma membrane (PM) where they serve as secondary active transporters involved in the efflux of auxin. The PM-localized PIN proteins show asymmetrical localisations on the membrane and are therefore responsible for polar auxin transport. Some other members of the PIN family (e.g. PIN5 and 8 in Arabidopsis) localize mostly at the ER-membrane or have a dual PM and ER localisation (e.g. PIN6 in Arabidopsis). These PIN proteins regulate the partitioning of auxin within the cell. The PM-localized PIN proteins physically interact with a few members of the large PGP family of transporters that also work as auxin efflux carriers (PGP1 and PGP19 in Arabidopsis). These interactions result in a synergistic increase in auxin efflux. The activity and localization of the PM-localized PIN proteins is regulated by several phosphorylations on their large cytosolic hydrophilic loop carried out by kinases of the AGC family (e.g. PID, WAG1, WAG2, PID2 in Arabidopsis) and the D6PK kinase.

They currently play they in the BAFA Premier League North. The Titans were given British American Football League status in 2003, although they missed the following season in order to be restructured for the 2005 campaign. The team was founded in 2003 by two Ex-Manchester Allstars Youth team players who had been playing their football outside of the city. As of 2017 the Titans play their home games at the National Speedway Stadium. The Titans are one of the biggest clubs in Great Britain with teams at Adult Contact, Adult Flag, Women's Contact, Women's Flag, U19 Contact, U17 North and U17 South Contact, U17 Flag and U12 Flag and a partnership to run a team at The Manchester College. The Titan have been awarded the title of British American Football program of the year in 2016 and 2017. History American Football was first played in the Greater Manchester area in 1983 when the Northwich Spartans played the London Ravens. The following season the Spartans were renamed the Manchester Spartans. Other active clubs in the Manchester area at the time were the Allstars and Heroes. In the 1990s all of the Manchester sides folded and the city was without a Football team until 2003 when the Titans were born. The formation of the club was inspired by the film \\"Remember the Titans\\", the club were founded by local players who until then had been travelling out of the City to play for other teams. The Titans were soon handed BAFA status and entered the year playing at Broughton Park F.C. Rugby Union Club, Manchester and finished with a 1-8-1 record before disbanding in 2004. Adult Contact In 2005, the Adult Contact team re- entered the league after being restructured with new coaching staff and players. They finished the season winning 5 games and losing. In 2007, they moved grounds and began playing their fixtures at Broughton Park RUFC. During this season they also advanced to the play-offs after a 7-2-1 record where they defeated the Nottingham Caesars only to be knocked out by the Dundee Hurricanes in the semi-final. In the 2009 season, The Titans won all 10 of their regular season games but were defeated in the first round play-off game against the Leicester Falcons. The following season saw the form continue and yet again they wiped the floor with the competition by winning all of their games on the route to the play-offs. This time they swiftly dispatched the West Coast Trojans and Shropshire Revolution to book their place in the National Final at the Britbowl. However, they were defeated 35-13 by the London Olympians. The 2011 season was to be difficult as a large number of players departed which saw the team swap a 100% winning record for a 100% losing record, and due to controversial restructuring of the leagues the Titans were relegated in 2012. In October 2014, the club played its first game inside the Salford City Stadium, where they notched up a 64-0 win over the Crewe Railroaders in front of a crowd of 1,349. A perfect 10-0 season in 2015 saw the Titans rise from Division 2 to Division 1 in the BAFA structure. A first season in Division 1 in 2016 saw the Titans claim a 7-3 record and a play-off run that ended in the quarter finals. In 2017 the team returned stronger, winning their division with a 9-1 record and advancing to the Division 1 national final where they beat the London Olympians 48-22 in the Britbowl Final to secure promotion to the Premier Division for 2018 Adult Flag The Titans Adult Flag team have been competing since 2013, offering non-contact American Football for men and women. The team have enjoyed playoff runs in both 2016 and 2017 and in 2017 clinched the MEC North division title to cement a place in the Premier Division and bragging rights as the best team in Manchester. Women's Contact The Titan's women's team have been at the forefront of the growth of the women's game. Having played in the Sapphire series since 2014 they were one of the founding members of the women's premier division in 2015 making the Semi-Finals in both 2017 and 2018 to be ranked the 4th best team in Great Britain. Titans players Sian Perry, Louise Fitzsimmons, Emily Parkinson and Sian Kersse have all represented Great Britain at both the 2015 European Championships and the 2017 World Cup. Women's Flag The women's only flag team enters the national Opal series run each autumn, playing teams from all over the country. The Titans best finish was a 6th place in 2014. U19 Contact U17 Contact U17 and U12 Flag Home Stadium The club have previously operated from the AJ Bell Stadium in Salford but from 2017 they have played at the Belle Vue Stadium. Notable Players The Club has had some talented and notable players over the years including Ricky Whittle and Chris Fountain (ex-Hollyoaks stars), Graham Roberts, Mark Squire, Nigel Dias, (all have represented GB Lions).

Certain specialised services are directly commissioned by NHS England, coordinated through the South East integrated regional team. Some NHS England structures are aligned on a Kent & Medway basis, others on a South East basis and there is liaison with London that provides many tertiary (highly specialised) healthcare services to the residents of Kent. History From 1947 to 1965 NHS services in Kent were managed by the South-East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. In 1974 the boards were abolished and replaced by regional health authorities. The whole of Kent came under the South East Metropolitan RHA. Regions were reorganised in 1996 and Kent came under the South Thames Regional Health Authority. Kent had an area health authority from 1974 until 1982 when it was divided into five district health authorities: Canterbury and Thanet; Dartford and Gravesham; Maidstone; Medway; South East Kent; and Tunbridge Wells. in 1993 these were amalgamated into two - West Kent and East Kent. Regional health authorities were reorganised and renamed strategic health authorities in 2002. Kent was under Kent and Medway SHA. In 2006 regions were again reorganised and Kent came under NHS South East Coast until that was abolished in 2013. There were three primary care trusts for the area: NHS Eastern and Coastal Kent; NHS West Kent; NHS Medway up until April 2013. After this eight clinical commissioning groups were established, being Canterbury and Coastal; Dartford Gravesham and Swanley; Medway; South Kent Coast; Swale; Thanet; West Kent; and Ashford. These were given conditional approval to amalgamate in October 2019 and this progressed with formal approval on 20th March 2020 to the formation of the Kent & Medway Clinical Commissioning Group on 1st April 2020. Sustainability and transformation plans Kent (and Medway) formed a sustainability and transformation plan area in March 2016 with Glenn Douglas, the Chief Executive of Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust as its leader. He was appointed accountable officer for all six CCGs in March 2018, having left the Trust. The subsequent establishment of a Kent & Medway Clinical Commissioning Group in 2020 evolved from this structure. In February 2018 it was reported that the Encompass project in Whitstable, Faversham & Canterbury had seen a 7.3% reduction in the emergency admissions rate in the area between 2014-15 and the 12 months to September 2017. Commissioning issues Community services are provided by Kent Community Health NHS Foundation Trust and Medway Community Healthcare. Community services in north Kent were transferred to Virgin Care by Swale CCG and Dartford, Gravesham and Swanley CCG in January 2016 in a contract for ¬£18 million a year for the next seven years from April 2016 with an option to extend by a further three years. Kent Community Health NHS Foundation Trust started proceedings for a judicial review of the decision in February 2016. They claimed that Virgin could not deliver the contract. West Kent Clinical Commissioning Group cancelled all 1,700 non-emergency operations due before April in February 2017 to save ¬£3.2 million by delaying them until the new financial year. It appeared in February 2018 that all the eight CCGs in Kent and Medway were contemplating a merger. Financial issues in three of the four East Kent CCGs and all four being placed in special measures resulted in August 2018 of an amalgamation of management functions (some other commissioning functions had been long aligned) The clinical commissioning groups in Kent were asked in September 2018 to find an extra ¬£2 million a year for the wheelchair service, operated by Millbrook Healthcare, which has a contract worth ¬£6.2 million a year because of the increasing complexity of cases. Primary and community care There are 262 GP practices in the county. Out-of-hours services are provided by IC24. In East Kent they were taken over by Primecare in early 2017. The contract envisaged integrating NHS 111 and GP out-of-hours services. Primecare was placed in special measures in August 2017 by the Care Quality Commission after it was rated inadequate ‚Äì only seven months after it started full operations. It is to hand back the 3 year contract in July 2018. Whitstable is one of the areas selected to pilot Multispecialty community providers, under the Five Year Forward View. Whitstable Medical Practice, with 53,000 patients, is one of the largest in England and is proposing to build a new community hospital and a ‚Äúteaching nursing home\\". The practice already has an ambulance response base, a minor injury clinic, a fracture clinic and acommunity pharmacy. It employs 25 consultants, and the local acute trust also rents space for outpatients. The multispecialty community provider is to develop into a super- practice of 17 practices and 125 GPs, with a population of 160,000 patients. Palliative care is provided by Demelza Hospice Care for Children and for adults the Pilgrims Hospices in East Kent, and elsewhere in Kent by the Heart of Kent Hospice, Hospice In The Weald, Ellenor Hospice and Wisdom hospice. . Virgin Care secured a seven year ¬£126 million contract to run services in community hospitals in Dartford, Gravesham, Swanley and Swale in January 2016. These services were formerly provided by Kent Community Health NHS Foundation Trust. The wheelchair service was transferred to Millbrook Healthcare in April 2017. Dermatology services in North and East Kent are provided by DMC Healthcare. The contract in north Kent was suspended in June 2020 because of concerns about long waiting times for treatment. Acute care The main providers of NHS acute hospital care in the county are East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust, Medway NHS Foundation Trust, and Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust. In September 2015 the South Kent Coast Clinical Commissioning Group set up a contract with the Centre Hospitalier de Calais for patients to travel to France for general surgery, gynaecology, cataract surgery, pain management and orthopaedics. The French hospital had been arranging English classes for nurses. Patients would have to meet their own travel costs. Inpatient specialist vascular services in the county are to be centralised, as neither Medway nor East Kent have sufficient staff, activity or facilities on their own. There are plans to consolidate the 6 existing stroke centres offering immediate stroke care to three, and to establish a thrombectomy centre, as at present patients have to be taken by air ambulance to St George‚Äôs Hospital, which takes an average of two hours from the decision to transfer. Campaigners against the plan lost their judicial review in February 2020. Patient transport services in the county are provided by G4S at a cost of ¬£15 million a year. They have not been able to meet the specified targets because although 14% fewer car journeys than expected were required, 4% more ambulance journeys were required and 9% more patients needing an escort. Mental health NHS Mental Health services are provided by Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust and Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust. Services for children and adolescents are provided by North East London NHS Foundation Trust, who took over from Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust in 2017. 76 children and young people out of 793 who had waited longer than the 18 week target time for treatment were put at risk by long delays in 2018/9. The trust does not expect to meet the 18 week target until October 2020. In December the CCGs, the NHS Trusts, the police and the local councils signed up to the Kent and Medway Mental Health Crisis Concordat whereby they all agreed to: *make early interventions to prevent people reaching crisis point. *ensure a multi-agency response for people in crisis so needs are met appropriately in a healthcare setting. *provide a plan that supports the recovery and prevents reoccurrence for those for people who have experienced a crisis.

This brought wealth, and he and his wife took the surname Dick,The Feminist Companion to Literature in English, eds Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 290. and were then styled Sir William Dick and Anne, Lady Dick.Jennett Humphreys, \\"Dick, Anne, Lady Dick (d. 1741)\\", rev. David Turner, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2004) Retrieved 21 December 2014. The baronetcy had been created for Sir John Dick Bt (1719‚Äì1804), who was the British Consul at Leghorn. Consternation Lady Anne and her maidservant caused consternation when they appeared in public in Edinburgh dressed as boys. Her peers and friends were also said to have been embarrassed when she published lampoons and verses of a \\"coarse\\" nature, for which she was censured in the Dictionary of National Biography. Three such were published in a Book of Ballads in 1823C. Kirkpatrick Sharpe, Book of Ballads, 1823. and others in 1824. Death Dick died childless in 1741 and her husband in 1746. The title was passed on to her brother-in-law, the physician Sir Alexander Dick, who moved into the family seat of Prestonfield House in Edinburgh.

The story focused on an African-American gold miner and a Caucasian logger who marry spouses of the opposite race (the gold miner marries a white woman and the logger marries a black woman), form a business partnership, then participate in a sex orgy. Steel depicted white and black communities as equally racist, and expressed the view that in order to end racism, people should forget race and drop out of society to return to an economy based on gold and bartering.Fox, M. Steven. Armageddon entry, ComixJoint. Accessed Sept. 22, 2016. Steel's political views were anarcho-capitalist, with his philosophy taking inspiration from the writing of author/philosopher Ayn Rand. The satire of Steel's work was occasionally controversial, such as in the first issue, which depicted civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. sodomizing segregationist George Wallace. Reception Steel's comic books were regarded within underground comix circles as being right-wing. M. Steven Fox, in contrast, writing for Comixjoint, feels that Steel's influences from Objectivism makes him closer to left-wing anarchists like Robert Crumb than right-wing pundits like Rush Limbaugh.

The country had a moratorium on capital punishment between 2006 and 2014. In late 2014 the moratorium was lifted and 11 persons were executed. Two more executions followed in 2015 and 15 executions took place in 2017. The method of execution is hanging, previously shooting was the sole method. History Between 2000 and the imposition of a moratorium in 2006 there had been 41 executions, either for murder, terrorism or sexual offences. In 2005 King Abdullah II of Jordan stated that: \\"in coordination with the European Union, we would like to modify our Penal Code. Jordan could soon become the first country in the Middle East without capital punishment.\\" In 2006 the Jordanian cabinet launched a plan to limit the number of capital offences from sixteen to ten. In 2008 and 2010 Jordan abstained to vote on the United Nations moratorium on the death penalty. In November 2014 the Jordanian cabinet formed a committee to explore whether Jordan should reinstate the application of capital punishment. On 21 December 2014 eleven persons were hanged, all men which were convicted of murder in 2005 and 2006. These were the first executions since June 2006, 122 sentences of capital punishment had been handed out since. Shortly before the executions Interior Minister Hussein Al-Majali had stated that capital punishment might be reinstated due to a major debate on the subject, and with the public believing that a recent rise in crime was caused by non-application of the death penalty. The lifting of the moratorium was criticized by human rights organisations. On 4 February 2015, shortly after discovering Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasasbeh had been killed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Jordan executed Sajida Mubarak Atrous al-Rishawi and Ziad Khalaf Raja al-Karbouly. Both had been convicted of terrorist offences. In February 2016 local media reported that a government committee had recommended the execution of 13 offenders, out of 80 investigated cases. 15 executions were carried out on the morning of 4 March 2017; 10 convicted with terrorism and the remaining 5 with \\"heinous\\" murder and rape of minors. Those convicted with terrorism were part of a bomb attack against the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad in 2003 that left dozens killed, an attack in Amman in 2006 in which a tourist was killed, a foiled terror plot in Irbid in 2016 that planned to bomb several civilian targets, an attack on intelligence officers in 2016 that left 5 dead and the assassination of Jordanian writer Nahed Hattar in 2016. In 2017 there were a total of 120 people on death row, including 12 women. Capital crimes Capital punishment is possible amongst others for murder, rape, terrorism, aggravated robbery, drug trafficking, illegal possession and use of weapons, war crimes, treason and espionage. Legal process In recent years most verdicts of capital punishment have been handed out by the State Security Court. Cases in which capital punishment is sentenced receive an automatic appeal. Article 93 of the Constitution of Jordan holds that \\"no death sentence may be carried out unless ratified by the King. Every such sentence shall be submitted to him by the Council of Ministers along with the council‚Äôs view on it.\\" Several categories of persons are excluded from being subjected to capital punishment. These are those under the age of 18, pregnant women, the mentally ill and mentally retarded.

His super-durable robotic body was equipped with advanced alien technology that, among other things, allowed him to generate force fields and sonic blasts and to shoot metal-melting laser beams out of his eyes. He also had a super- intelligent computer brain programmed with the scientific knowledge of two worlds that could alter his internal mechanisms to do anything from breathe underwater to travel through time. Captain Marvel's signature ability, however, was the power to detach his head, limbs and hands and send them flying off in all directions whenever he shouted \\"Split!\\" and reattach them when he shouted \\"Xam!\\"Howlett, Mike, The Weird World of Eerie Publications, Feral House, 2010 p. 281 Despite these impressive talents (which also included the handy trick of being able to make his outer clothing disappear and reappear at will),Captain Marvel #3 (Sept. 1966)Captain Marvel Presents the Terrible Five #1 (Sept. 1966) he was by no means invulnerable. He had to remember to rub his energy-giving amulet once every twenty-four hours in order to recharge his system or else he would start to lose important functions like memory and mobility. Glass barriers and electronic interference could prevent him from reassembling himself, and his metallic structure meant he could be attracted and held by powerful magnets. What's more his synthetic body parts were made of materials not available on Earth and could not be replaced if lost or destroyed. However his real vulnerability, if it could be called that, was that he was built by his creators to think and react like a human being. He was capable of empathy, compassion and curiosity but also of making all too human mistakes.

Having first faced off against Captain Marvel before the hero had started wearing a mask to protect his identity, Fate soon noticed the strong resemblance between his alien adversary and the mild-mannered Prof. Winkle and came to the obvious conclusion that they were one and the same person, but he quickly discovered that proving it was a whole other matter. Winged masked magician, hypnotist and megalomaniacal mastermind the Bat visually resembled Batman enough to prompt a response from DC Comics attorneys threatening to sue for plagiarism.

However Captain Marvel's true nemesis, the only foe he actually \\"hated\\" (because he was pre-programmed to by his makers), was the Destroyer (no relation to the Marvel Comics character). An android like himself, the skullcap-clad Destroyer was a burly and literally fiery-eyed weapon of mass destruction who, in addition to being virtually indestructible and able to fly through the vast depths of space, could shoot devastating blasts of flame out of the yellow circle on his chest and had magnetic hands designed to grapple with his metal-bodied foe. Created by the enemy Volcano People of the hero's home planet, the Destroyer also escaped the death of their world and was now allied with Earth's own hostile subterranean race.Captain Marvel presents The Terrible Five Vol.2, No. 5 Sept. 1967 And then there was Tinyman, a miniature human being who, in an inversion of Ant-Man and the Atom's powers, could grow to normal adult male size and quickly shrink back down again.

The idea behind constructive journalism is to give stories more context and make the consumer of the news more intelligent. By giving more background and also reporting what is going well, so that people are more able to create a realistic view of the world. Instead of only reporting the issues, with constructive journalism the journalist also addresses what the consumer can do with the information, such as how they might take action on the issue. The journalist does not reflect his or her opinion and also does not render or implement what those solutions are, but tries to inform the society of what solutions there might be. Pioneers of constructive journalism say that as a journalist you have a big impact on the way people think, because of the way you construct the news. Journalists need to be aware of that responsibility more by being more careful in the way they construct their stories. They think that many journalist, who use a very cynical way of reporting the news, forget that by reporting everything that is going wrong from a distance, they also move the society.Gyldensted, Cathrine \\"You will not believe what Upworthy can teach the media about sustainability\\". \\"The Guardian\\". 14 August 2014.

Additionally, it strives to strengthen the ethics code of journalism by avoiding the distortion of information in order to provide a more real portrayal of the world. Constructive journalism attempts to create an engaging narrative that is factually correct without exaggerating numbers or realities. The world's first Ph.D. dissertation on constructive journalism was completed at the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in 2015, by Karen McIntyre.McIntyre, Karen .  Applications  According to the Danish journalist Cathrine Gyldensted, the Canadian family systems therapist Karl Tomm's four types of therapeutic questioning can be adopted into an interview approach that can also be used by journalists.Gyldensted, Cathrine. \\"How can we challenge power anew? Try family therapy\\". Positive News. 12 September 2014. Retrieved 3 December 2014. Tomm's original framework provides four types of questions a therapist can use in psychotherapy sessions to bring about positive therapeutic outcomes from clients. By using the same model in journalism, similarly constructive answers could be obtained from the interviewee. In what he named the \\"interventive interviewing\\" devised to facilitate positive changes in family dynamics, Tomm divides questions into four types based on two intersecting dimensions that make up four quadrants.Karl Tomm og de 4 sp√∏rgsm√•lstyper (Karl Tomm and the 4 types of question). YouTube.com. Retrieved 2 December 2014. The first dimension of intentionality differentiates between \\"orienting questions\\" that help interviewers (therapists) orient their views about the interviewees (clients) and \\"influencing questions\\" that challenge the interviewees' (clients') understanding of themselves. When used outside psychotherapy, such as in journalism, this dimension of intentionality is also interpreted as the temporal dichotomy between past-orientation and future-orientation.Myllerup, Bent. \\"Your Strategy for Asking Powerful Questions\\". agile42. 7 October 2013.

New York: Ballantine Books, 1972.Bateson, G. Mind and nature: A necessary unity. New York: E.P. Dutton, 1979. differentiates between lineal assumptions that take a reductionist, deterministic approach and circular assumptions that take a holistic, systemic approach. The resulting four types of questions are: # Linear Questions (\\"The Detective\\"): Basic investigative questions that deal with \\"Who did what?, Where?, When?, and Why?\\". This type of questions helps discover the factual aspect of the problem or issue. # Circular Questions (\\"The Anthropologist\\"): This type of questions discovers relevant contextual perspective behind the facts. Examples: \\"How did this affect you (or other things/people/etc.)?\\" and \\"What is your explanation for A or B?\\". # Reflexive Questions (\\"The Future Scientist\\"): In reflective questions, the interviewer suggests a new perspective on a given topic, thereby nudging the interviewee to reflect on a new possibility of constructive solutions to the problem or issue. Examples: \\"What do you think A believes, when he is in that situation?\\", \\"How would you approach this problem?\\", and \\"What action should be taken in order to do A or B?\\" # Strategic Questions (\\"The Captain\\"): Directs the interviewee into commitment of the solution. Examples: \\"What should be done?\\", \\"Will you do it?\\", and \\"When will you do it?\\" Gyldensted reports that conventional journalists tend to be past-oriented and hence leave out future-oriented questions, especially the \\"Future Scientist\\". For example, in a four-hour press conference with a former Danish prime minister, the press asked 59% \\"Detective\\", 19.4% \\"Captain\\", 18.7% \\"Anthropologist\\", and only 3% \\"Future Scientist\\" questions out of a total of more than 130 questions. \\"As a consequence,\\" she writes, \\"[journalists] miss out on asking questions that explore new perspectives, solutions and visions, and on triggering actions based on those perspectives.\\" An ideal, constructive interview requires a balance among all four types of questions, because \\"[a]n interview containing all four roles of questioning [...] reveals the problem and the involved parties (Detective), provides reflection on what has happened (Anthropologist), points towards a solution or maps a bigger vision (Future Scientist), and commits decision-makers (Captain).\\" These four types of questions, being grounded in family therapy, is especially effective in political journalism, because the interviewer can encourage \\"mediation in political debates\\" and hence facilitate constructive collaboration among politicians.Gyldensted, Cathrine. \\"How journalists could be more constructive ‚Äì and boost audiences\\".

Polish Army's Siberian Brigade, commanded by Colonel Kazimierz Rumsza, clashed with Red Army's 11th and 16th Rifle Divisions (part of 5th Army under General August Kork). Polish Siberian Brigade was supported by subunits of 9th and 18th Infantry Divisions. The battle took place near the village of Borkowo, where Poles defended the Wkra river crossings. Following the order of General J√≥zef Haller, who commanded Polish Northern Front, 5th Army (General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski) began on August 14, 1920 an attack on Soviet 15th Army, which concentrated along the Wkra river. On August 13, the Siberian Brigade of Colonel Rumsza concentrated in the area of Borkowo and Popiel≈ºyn- Zawady, and on the same day, after a 14-hour march from Zegrze, 1st Siberian Infantry Regiment (Major Franciszek Dindorf-Ankowicz) also arrived at Borkowo, tasked with defence of the Wkra crossings. Behind the infantry, Polish artillery took positions, and before midnight, 2nd Siberian Infantry Regiment reinforced Polish defences. The Siberian Brigade was a fresh unit, formed out of remains of 5th Division (Colonel Walerian Czuma), soldiers of the former Blue Army, and volunteers, including a number of boyscouts and high school students (among the volunteers were two classes from a boys' high school in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, who had only two weeks of training). The Brigade was regarded as a weak unit, in which officers hardly knew their soldiers. It faced Soviet 11th and 16th Rifle Divisions of the 5th Army. Polish headquarters was not aware of crushing Soviet superiority in the area of Borkowo. On August 14, Captain Jozef Werobej decided to push the Soviets out of Popielzyn-Zawady, in order to secure the Wkra crossings and open the way towards Nowe Miasto. Werobej ordered 3rd Battalion, which consisted of veterans of the Blue Army, to attack the Soviets. At app. 1 p.m. Poles crossed the Wkra, surprising Soviet 16th Rifles. Soon other Polish companies crossed the river, but the plan was abandoned because of the situation near Cieksyn, where Polish defensive lines were destroyed by the enemy. Cieksyn was lost, and Polish forces in the area, after losing almost all of the officers, retreated to the western bank of the Wkra. After a short artillery barrage, the Soviets crossed the Wkra, and pushed the Poles out of Borkowo. Further Soviet advance in this sector threatened whole Polish frontline, but meanwhile Poles were reinforced by 35th and 41st Infantry Regiments of 9th Infantry Divisions. Both took positions north of the village, and managed to stop Soviet advance with machine gun fire. In the night of August 15 / 15, Polish forces in the area were ordered by General Sikorski to continue their advance, regardless of the losses. Colonel Rumsza decided to attack Nowe Miasto, and on August 15, at 1 pm, Polish assault began. During the fighting, some Polish companies lost 50% of their manpower, but after hand-to-hand fighting, the Soviets were forced to retreat, and Polish regiments took positions on the eastern bank of the Wkra. The Battle of Borkowo lasted two days, during which Polish Army lost some 500 men. Nevertheless, the Poles managed to halt Soviet advance, and push its forces back behind the Wkra. With positions on the eastern bank of the river, Polish Army achieved strategic advantage for its future attacks towards Nasielsk and Pu≈Çtusk.

On 14 August 1920 units of Polish Fifth Army (General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski) began crossing the Wkra river, assaulting Soviet 15th Army of General August Kork. Operational Group of General Krajowski attacked the enemy in its weakest point: the gap between Soviet 4th and 15th Armies. Krajowski, who was at first unaware of this situation, decided to take advantage of it, and turned his forces towards Glinojeck, to hit the wing of the 15th Army. During the night of 14‚Äì15 August, after hand-to-hand combat, the Poles seized Sochocin. On 15 August three Soviet rifle divisions (4th, 11th and 16th) attacked Polish positions along the Wkra river. At the same time, Polish 8th Cavalry Brigade captured Ciechan√≥w in a surprising raid. On the night of 15‚Äì16 August, Polish 42nd Infantry Regiment captured Sarnowa G√≥ra. Polish activities were noticed by General Kork, who sent his 33rd Rifle Division towards Ciechan√≥w, ordering it to recapture the town and then continue its advance towards P≈Ço≈Ñsk, together with 4th and 16th Rifle Divisions. Soviet units advanced, forcing the Poles into retreat, and threatening the flank of Polish 18th Infantry Division. General Krajowski decided to send reinforcements to Sarnowa G√≥ra, and after bloody fighting, the enemy was pushed north. On the night of 16‚Äì17 August, Polish 144th Infantry Regiment, together with 8th Cavalry Brigade reinforced Polish frontline north of Ojrze≈Ñ. With these forces, General Krajowski planned to attack the left flank of Soviet 54th Rifle Division, which was part of 4th Army (General Aleksandr Shuvayev). The Russians forestalled the Poles, and attacked both Ojrze≈Ñ and Sarnowa G√≥ra. Despite initial Soviet successes, Poles kept their positions. In the evening of 17 August, Polish units regrouped. On the next day, Soviet 33rd Rifle Division once again tried to capture Sarnowa G√≥ra and Ojrze≈Ñ, in order to open the road towards P≈Ço≈Ñsk. After artillery barrage, Soviet infantry entered the battle, but failed to push back the Poles. On the night of 18‚Äì19 August, Soviet armies began their retreat. Soviet losses are unknown, while some Polish units, such as 145th Infantry Regiment, lost 50% of their manpower.

It was the first battle of the so-called Pulawy Legion, a Polish military formation of World War One, which was part of the Imperial Russian Army. Soldiers of the Legion clashed with the German Empire armed forces, during Russian retreat of 1915 (see also Great Retreat). The Pulawy Legion, formed in January 1915, had by March 1915 some 1,000 soldiers and officers, and was attached to the Moscow Grenadiers. In early May of that year, the Gorlice-Tarnow Offensive of the Central Powers began, and on May 18, the Legion was sent to Krzyzanowice, north of Ilza, near Russian- German frontline. Since mid-May German Landwehr units had been trying to create a gap in Russian line, but their attacks were repelled. In the night of May 19‚Äì20, the Pulawy Legion was ordered to march across the swamps near Pakoslaw, towards German positions. Polish soldiers had to abandon their personal belongings, including haversacks and mess kits, so as not to reveal their positions to the enemy. Also, smoking was prohibited. Before midnight, Poles found themselves in close vicinity to German trenches and began their attack. Suffering heavy losses, the Poles managed to cross German barbed wire and capture first line of enemy trenches, where hand-to-hand combat ensued. Some Polish platoons lost up to 75% of soldiers, and under the circumstances, they began to retreat. Commandant of the Legion, Antoni Reutt, was himself injured. After the battle, the Legion was sent to Russian rear for rest and training, after which it became an experienced unit. Meanwhile, Russian-German front in the area of Ilza stagnated for over a month, with soldiers dug in trenches. In mid-June 1915, Russian headquarters decided to use the Legion to protect other units while they regrouped. On June 15, Colonel Jan Rzadkowski was ordered to man Russian trenches between Michalow and Pakoslaw. German officers quickly realized chaotic situation among Russian forces, and began artillery barrage, followed by infantry assault. The exchange of fire lasted for 18 hours, after which Polish-Russian forces counterattacked German right flank. In late June 1915, Germans managed to break through Russian defences and the whole Russian front collapsed. The Pulawy Legion suffered heavy losses, and by September, it had only 100 soldiers. As a result, it was dissolved in mid-October, and the survivors joined the Brigade of Polish Riflemen. In the 1920s, ashes of the soldiers of the Pulawy Legion were collected from the battlefield and buried in a mass grave near the folwark at Pakoslaw. Also, a monument of the Legion was unveiled in Pakoslaw. The Battle of Pakoslaw is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription \\"PAKOSLAW 19‚Äì20 V 1915\\".

It was a strut-braced high wing monoplane, seating two side-by-side in a cabin under the wing leading edge and powered by a Continental A65 air-cooled flat-four engine. The wings were rectangular in plan and the lift struts were V-form pairs from the lower fuselage. The Plein Air had a flat sided fuselage which tapered to the tail. This was conventional, with a straight edged fin and rudder with a rounded top. Its tailplane was strut braced to the fin. The tourer had a fixed tail wheel undercarriage with main wheels on split axles mounted on the central fuselage underside; the legs were faired-in V-struts from the lower fuselage. The tail wheel, mounted on a telescopic leg, was also faired. Its first flight was on 18 June 1949 but it did not receive its Certificate of Airworthiness (C of A) until 24 August 1957.

Sometimes it has been considered as a subgenus of Arion, and sometimes the subgenus Ichnusarion has been raised to generic rank. Etymology The stem of Arion plus the suffix -unculus, which is a diminutive in Latin. Hence \\"little Arion\\". Pollonera justifies why \\"Ariunculus\\" is appropriate rather than \\"Arionculus\\" (cf. \\"homo\\" and \\"homunculus\\"). The subgenus name Ichnusarion is also based on \\"Arion\\", to which has been added \\"Ichnusa\\", a Latin name of Sardinia, where the single species of this subgenus is endemic. Species Only two species are currently recognised: subgenus Ariuncululus * Ariunculus speziae Lessona, 1881 - type species of the genus; Italian Alps with one record in Switzerland subgenus Ichnusarion Pollonera, 1890 * Ariunculus isselii Lessona & Pollonera, 1882 - Sardinia Other species have been discounted as distinct members of the genus: * A. mortilleti and A. camerani are considered synonyms of A. speziae (all three were originally described in the same article, but differ only in size and coloration, not genitalia); * A. moreleti is considered a species of Letourneuxia; * A. pallaryi matches Letourneuxia numidica in its description; * A. austriacus has been synonymised with Arion subfuscus; * A. tricolor and A. nigratus are thought to have been misidentified juveniles of a large Arion; * A. ischii was apparently a misprint for A. isselii. Diagnostic characters Genital characters that have been proposed as diagnostic of the genus are: * the genital pore is very anterior, anterior to the pneumostome; * the atrium is large; * the duct of the bursa copulatrix opens near the end of the epiphallus; * the oviduct is long with two bends; * the epiphallus blends imperceptibly with the vas deferens; At least in one species of Ariunculus, this last character reflects that sperm is transferred naked rather than in a spermatophore formed in the epiphallus; this is a fundamental contrast with Arion and Geomalacus. Ariunculus differs from Geomalacus, and is similar to Arion, in that the caudal gland is prominent and the mantle contains only calcareous granules rather than a shell plate.

After Shi was defeated and taken captive by Liao's Emperor Taizong, Feng was taken to Liao as well and died there.  Family background  It is not known when Feng Yu was born. His family was from Ding Prefecture (ÂÆöÂ∑û, in modern Baoding, Hebei), but it is (based on his father's career) unclear whether he was born there. His father Feng Meng () was the liaison officer for Yiwu Circuit (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered at Ding) to the Later Tang court early during the reign of the second Later Tang emperor Li Siyuan. Feng Meng was described to be intelligent but wicked, and he gained the favor of Li Siyuan's powerful chief of staff An Chonghui, and was eventually promoted to be the deputy defender of Yedu (ÈÑ¥ÈÉΩ, in modern Handan, Hebei).New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 17.An Chonghui became Li Siyuan's chief of staff shortly after Li Siyuan became emperor in 926, and fell from grace in 931, so Feng Meng's commission must have occurred during that period, and Shi Jingtang's commission limited that period further to 926 to 928. See Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 275, 277. When Li Siyuan's son-in-law Shi Jingtang later became the defender of Yedu in 928,Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 75. he became friendly with Feng Meng, and decided to take Feng Meng's daughter as the wife for his younger brother Shi Chongyin, whom he had adopted as a son. Shi Chongyin died early, however, and Lady Feng became widowed. (The historical sources are not in accord as to whether Feng Yu was older or younger than she was; Feng Yu's biography in the Old History of the Five Dynasties described her as a younger sister,Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 89. as did her biography in the New History of the Five Dynasties; his biography in the New History of the Five Dynasties, however, described her as an older sister.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 56.)  During Later Tang and/or early Later Jin  It was said that Feng Yu took the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class multiple times, but was unable to pass. When Feng Yun served as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), he invited Feng Yu to serve as his secretary.Feng Yun apparently became Hedong's military governor in 930 and was shortly after moved to Zhongwu Circuit (Âø†Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan) instead, so Feng Yu's service under him must be in that short duration. See New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 27. Feng Yu later served as an imperial censor with the title of Jiancha Yushi (); he later served as Libu Langzhong (), a supervisory official at the ministry of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®, Libu); and then as an assistant to the director of salt and iron monopolies. (It is unclear whether Feng Yu's progression of offices would be still during Later Tang, or after Shi Jingtang had overthrown Later Tang and founded Later Jin as its emperor.)  During Shi Chonggui's reign as Later Jin emperor  In 942, Shi Jingtang died and was succeeded as emperor by his adoptive son (biological nephew) Shi Chonggui. Shi Chonggui had long been attracted to Feng Yu's sister Lady Feng, and married her shortly after succeeding to the throne. In 943, he further created her empress. She soon became heavily involved in his governance.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. As the empress' brother, Feng Yu's power also rose quickly, as he became Zhongshu Sheren () and became in charge of drafting imperial edicts. However, as he himself lacked the necessary skills to do so, he often had another Zhongshu Sheren, Yin Peng (), draft the edicts for him. Apparently in short order, he became the military prefect (ÂúòÁ∑¥‰Ωø, Tuanlianshi) of Ying Prefecture (ÊΩÅÂ∑û, in modern Fuyang, Anhui), and then quickly promoted to be imperial scholar at Duanming Hall and deputy minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Hubu Shilang), becoming often involved in Shi's policy-decision process. Both Feng Yu and Li Yantao () became close associates of the emperor, and then resented the power wielded by the emperor's chief of staff (Shumishi), Sang Weihan, who was also chancellor. They therefore often defamed Sang, leading to Shi's wanting to remove Sang from his chancellor position, although Shi was dissuaded from doing so by the chancellors Li Song and Liu Xu. When Sang became aware of this, he requested to have Feng be deputy chief of staff ‚Äî a request that Feng was not happy about. In response, in spring 945, Shi made Feng chief of staff as well (serving with Sang) and minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Hubu Shangshu), to divert some of Sang's power.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. In fall 945, the chancellor He Ning was removed from his post, and Feng was given the additional designations of chancellor (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã, Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi) and Zhongshu Shilang (). It was said that because he was particularly capable of pleasing the emperor, he became even more powerful, such that on an occasion when he was on leave due to illness, Shi stated to the other chancellors, \\"For all posts that are at the prefect level or greater, wait until Feng Yu returned to fill them.\\" Feng used the emperor's trust for personal benefit, such that those who wanted posts all went to his mansion to bribe him, leading to a degradation of the Later Jin governance. (Yin, as a close associate of Feng's, also took many bribes.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. In winter 945, after Feng accused Sang of wanting to use Shi's then-illness to replace him with Shi Jingtang's biological son Shi Chongrui () and Sang's other political enemies Li Yantao and Li Shouzhen compounding the accusations, Shi Chonggui deposed Sang and made him the mayor of the capital Kaifeng. (When Feng Yu's associates tried to argue to him that being mayor of the capital, with many minute responsibilities, was an inappropriate post for someone with Sang's accomplishments and that he should be given a military governorship, Feng stated that he was fearful that Sang might rebel. When they pointed out that Sang was a civilian and could not rebel, Feng stated, \\"Even if he did not rebel himself, he might encourage someone else to do so,\\" alluding to Sang's having encouraged Shi Jingtang to rebel.) In fall 946, there were rumors that Zhao Yanshou, a major general of Later Jin's northern neighbor Liao ‚Äî whose Emperor Taizong had been instrumental in Shi Jingtang's success in overthrowing Later Tang but with whom Shi Chonggui had engaged in wars ‚Äî was planning to defect to Later Jin. Feng and Li Song (who was by this point also chief of staff) believed the rumors, and had Shi Chonggui's uncle-by-marriage Du Wei the military governor of Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), write to Zhao to further entice him. At Emperor Taizong's instruction, Zhao wrote back to \\"confirm\\" his intention to do so, in order to set a trap for Later Jin forces. Shi, believing that this was time to launch a major attack against Liao, commissioned Du and Li Shouzhen to command a large army against Liao. (This was despite chancellor Zhao Ying's misgivings, pointing out that Du was always dissatisfied despite his honored position, and suggesting that Li Shouzhen be put in command alone ‚Äî a suggestion that Feng and Li Song gave no heed.) However, even before Du and Li Shouzhen reached Liao territory, they were encountered by the Liao army, commanded by Emperor Taizong himself, and were surrounded at Zhongdu Bridge (‰∏≠Â∫¶Ê©ã, in modern Baoding, Hebei). When Emperor Taizong promised to have Du made the emperor of China instead, Du and Li Shouzhen surrendered. With them accompanying him, Emperor Taizong quickly headed for Kaifeng. With nearly the entire Later Jin imperial army having been given to Du and Li Shouzhen earlier, Kaifeng was left virtually undefended, and Shi, judging that he could not resist, surrendered, ending Later Jin. When Emperor Taizong sent the former Later Jin general Zhang Yanze into Kaifeng first to accept the surrender, the soldiers pillaged Feng's mansion and took much of the massive wealth that he had accumulated. Meanwhile, Feng tried to ingratiate both Zhang and Emperor Taizong, offering to personally surrender the Later Jin imperial seal to Emperor Taizong; Zhang declined.  During Liao  Emperor Taizong ordered that Shi Chonggui and his entire family be moved to Liao proper. (He declared himself the emperor of China as well as of Khitan, but later in the year would withdraw from the Central Plains and die on the way.) Among the Later Jin officials ordered to be part of Shi's train were Zhao Ying, Feng Yu, and Li Yantao.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. After Feng arrived at the Liao court, he was given the honorary title of Taizi Taibao (). In either 952 (according to the Old History of the Five Dynasties) or 953 (according to the New History of the Five Dynasties), by which time the Central Plains was under the rule of Later Zhou, Feng Yu's son Feng Jie () fled from Liao and defected to Later Zhou. Feng, in fear, died not long after.  Notes and references  * Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 89. * New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 56. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 283, 284, 285, 286.

While both the meteorological and astronomical definitions of winter involve the onset of winter occurring in December, many places in North America experienced their first wintry weather during mid November. A period of below-average temperatures affected much of the contiguous United States, and several records were broken. An early trace of snowfall was recorded in Arkansas. There were greater accumulations of snow across parts of Oklahoma as well. A quasi-permanent phenomenon referred to as the polar vortex may have been partly responsible for the cold weather. Temperatures in much of the United States dropped below average by November 19 following a southward \\"dip\\" of the polar vortex into the eastern two-thirds of the country. The effects of this dip were widespread, bringing about temperatures as low as in Pensacola, Florida. Following a significant snowstorm there, Buffalo, New York received several feet of snow from November 17‚Äì21. During the 2014‚Äì15 winter season, Boston broke its all-time official seasonal snowfall record from the winter of 1995‚Äì96, with a total snowfall record of as of March 15, 2015. Many records for snowfall and temperature were broken, many for the month of February, with every state east of the Mississippi River being colder than average, some for the entire winter. However, this meteorological winter was the 19th-warmest of the past 120 winters over the lower 48 states, largely due to persistent warm weather in the West. While there is no well-agreed-upon date used to indicate the start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, there are two definitions of winter which may be used. Based on the astronomical definition, winter begins at the winter solstice, which in 2014 occurred on December 21, and ends at the March equinox, which in 2015 occurred on March 20. Based on the meteorological definition, the first day of winter is December 1 and the last day February 28. Both definitions involve a period of approximately three months, with some variability.  Seasonal forecasts  On October 16, 2014, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center issued its U.S. Winter Outlook. This outlook indicated that below-average temperatures in parts of the south-central and southeastern United States would be favored, with above-average temperatures favored in the western U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, and New England. Drought conditions were expected to improve in California's southern and northwestern regions, but no improvements were expected earlier than December or January. Above-average conditions were also expected to pervade the winter months in the western U.S., the Intermountain West extending across the U.S.‚ÄìCanada border through New York and New England, and Alaska and Hawaii. The Precipitation Outlook favored above-average precipitation across the southern tier and Atlantic coast of the United States, with above-average precipitation also favored in southern Alaska and the Alaska panhandle. Below-average precipitation was favored in Hawaii, the northwestern United States, and near the Great Lakes region. The rest of the country was given an \\"equal chance\\" for either above- or below-average temperatures and/or precipitation. On November 30, 2014, Environment Canada's monthly prediction system produced a forecast for the months of December, January, and February across Canada. Areas in and just off the western coast of British Columbia were considered the most likely areas for above-average temperatures. Other areas where above-average temperatures were favored by the forecast included Yukon, the Northwest Territories, northern parts of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and northwestern parts of Manitoba. Below-average temperatures were favored in and near Lake Superior in Ontario, across much of Hudson Bay, in far-eastern parts of Nunavut, and in northern parts of Quebec. The most favorable locations for above-average precipitation were northwestern British Columbia, southwestern Yukon, eastern parts of the Northwest Territories, western parts of Nunavut, and Newfoundland. The most favorable areas for below-average precipitation were southeastern British Columbia, southern Alberta, southern Saskatchewan, some northern parts of Quebec, and an isolated spot in the northern half of Nunavut.  Seasonal summary  A strong storm impacts the Pacific coast of the United States on December 12 The North American winter season to date has expressed a significant level of variance. First, a cyclone in the Bering Sea enabled a change in the atmospheric pattern to occur; according to Jeff Masters from Weather Underground, this cyclone brought about a \\"ripple\\" in the jet stream, and the presence of a high- pressure ridge over the western United States and a low-pressure trough over the southern and central United States enabled a great intrusion of very cold air to pervade southward out of Canada. Following the onset of the cold wave, multiple snow events occurred; one significant storm dropped as much as of snow in a single area, and impacts covered a broad area. In December, yet another storm impacted parts of North America; the storm brought relief to drought-stricken parts of California, but it also brought dangerous mudflows to fire-ravaged areas where the soil could not handle the excess precipitation. Less than two weeks after this events, another storm impacted the Pacific coast of the United States; this storm, fueled by the \\"Pineapple Express\\", knocked out power to over one hundred thousand customers in the San Francisco Bay Area after producing strong winds. Hurricane-force winds were reported in parts of the northwestern United States. Regions reported as much as of rainfall, and parts of the Sierra Nevada reported of snowfall. Average temperature anomaly for the winter in the United States Due to a persistent stationary high-pressure pattern over the west coast that redirects the jet stream, it remained (and remains) in a wavy ideal configuration to bring warm air north over the western U.S. and cold air towards the south over the continental states, and to favor winter storms over the East Coast. Severe winter blizzards over New England are often associated with this configuration, and nearly all of the snow storms this season followed very similar tracks and had marked similarities in their synoptic evolution. Boston in particular saw the effects of this, experiencing six major snow storms in the first two months of the year, leaving it with over of snow. January 27 saw first major snowfall of 2015, with observations showing a blocked flow with warm air over the west coast, accompanied by a pronounced cold trough downstream, which pattern looks very similar to the blizzard that Boston saw on January 23, 2005. As a result, February was record-breaking for many cities in the United States, yet in opposite extremes. Much of February saw below- average cold in the eastern part of the country, it was markedly warm in the West. A multitude of cities east of the Mississippi experienced their coldest February in decades, including Chicago, Ill.; Cleveland, Oh.; Grand Rapids, Mich.; Harrisburg, Pa.; Hartford, Conn.; and Portland, Maine. Marquette, Mich. Syracuse, Buffalo and Rochester, N.Y. also set records for coldest month overall, as did Bangor, Maine where the average temperature was . And with an average temperature of , the state of Maine itself also set a record low. For Worcester, Mass, February was the coldest month out of any month on record with an average temperature of just , while also accumulating more than of snow this winter. In contrast, in the West a persistently strong ridge of high pressure over the warm eastern Pacific Ocean and western North America elevated temperatures to record levels from Arizona to Washington. It was the warmest winter month (December, January, February) on record in San Francisco; Seattle; Portland, Ore.; Reno, Nev.; Las Vegas; and Salt Lake City, with the latter realizing an average temperature for February of , breaking the old record set in 1907. Meanwhile, just of snow fell in the entire month in Anchorage, Alaska, making it the fifth-least-snowy February on record. Portland and Salem had their warmest February on record, with the latter tying the record set in 1934 for their warmest at degrees with the year. For the first time in record keeping, every day in February was at least in Salem. California averaged warmer than the previous warmest winter (2013‚Äì14), which had broken the previous record (1980‚Äì81) by . February was the warmest on record in Washington, California, Utah and Arizona, while February was among the top 10 warmest in four other states. Overall, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that about 30.6 percent of the country was \\"very warm\\" ‚Äì meaning February was in the warmest 10 percent of the historical record ‚Äì while 31.5 percent of the country was \\"very cold,\\" or in the coldest 10 percent historically.  Events  There were several winter weather events during the 2014‚Äì15 North American winter. Significant events include cold waves, snowstorms, and other notable events outside the conventional limits of winter.  November Bering Sea cyclone  The cyclone in the Bering Sea, as viewed early on November 8, at peak intensity In early November 2014, Typhoon Nuri peaked in intensity as a Category 5-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. The storm became extratropical on November 8, and it was absorbed by a new center of circulation. The new, more powerful cyclone entered the Bering Sea, and intensified to become the most powerful storm to ever impact the region, with a minimum barometric pressure of . This compares to the previous record of from a storm on October 25, 1977. In association with the storm, there were winds exceeding hurricane-force with a wind gust of recorded at Shemya, Alaska. The storm also produced waves as high as , although waves were lesser on the Alaska coast. The storm weakened as it moved westward, and it produced a \\"ripple\\" in the jet stream which allowed for a strong cold front to dive southward out of Canada into the United States, producing a cold wave.  November cold wave  In early November, a cyclone in the Bering Sea entered Alaska, generating a ripple in the jet stream. The coincident presence of high pressure over the western United States and low pressure over the southern and central United States enabled very cold air in Canada to travel southward. Denver, Colorado experienced a record low temperature for November 13 when temperatures dropped to , breaking the previous record of set in 1916, and Freeze Watches and Freeze Warnings were issued across the Deep South by the National Weather Service. The cold wave was accompanied by multiple snow events as well. By November 10, Winter Storm Warnings and Winter Weather Advisories had been issued across most areas from the northern Rocky Mountains to the Great Lakes. Michigan received snow totals as high as through December 12 from a system associated with the early cold wave. The storm also brought high winds; Snowbasin, Utah even received wind gusts of , and parts of several mountain states and Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma recorded gale-force winds.  Mid- November winter storm  The winter storm as viewed by GOES 13 on November 17 While the cold wave was still ongoing, a storm entered the northwestern United States transporting much warmer and moister air over shallow cold air near the surface. On November 13, Portland, Oregon recorded accumulation of ice. Other areas in the state recorded additional ice accumulations and one area recorded of snow. By state, maximum snow totals as high as were recorded near Ouray, Colorado, with six other states reporting totals of at least . Several states in the Great Plain region received over of snow, and Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth reported a trace of snow on November 16 for the first time in 117 years of records. An Oklahoma Mesonet station in Boise City, Oklahoma recorded a high temperature of on December 12 only two days after recording a high temperature of . Snow accumulations of and greater occurred across western, northern, and central Oklahoma. On November 13, a total of of snow was recorded in Little Rock, Arkansas, the earliest accumulating snow measured in the area in over 20 years. Gaylord, Michigan received a record amount of snow for any time of the year, with from November 18‚Äì20. In Buffalo, New York, significant snowfall occurred during the November 17‚Äì21 period, with of snow recorded.  Early December nor'easter  On December 9, a strong nor'easter moved ashore over New England, bringing with it heavy rain, wind, some ice, and snow in interior parts of the region, some which were battered hard by Hurricane Sandy more than 2 years prior. Developing from a stalled frontal boundary off the East Coast, it then moved up the coast late on December 8 and continued to intensify and then move inland on Long Island around noon December 9, before stalling for a day or so. Cold air coming in from the north resulted in the western side becoming snow. The system gradually moved to the east, before dissipating on December 11. Snowfall totals peaked at from this system.  Mid-December storm complex  On December 9, 2014, ahead of a system moving onto the California coast, the National Weather Service issued several watches and warnings, including a Gale Warning, a Flash Flood Watch, a High Wind Watch, and a Hazardous Seas Advisory. The storm complex brought heavy rain and snow to much of California. On hillsides scorched by wildfires, the rains brought down mud and rocks which covered part of California State Route 91. The system brought from about to over of rain in some areas. High snowfall totals were recorded as well, with a maximum snowfall of near Lodgepole, California. Recorded gusts of hurricane-force were recorded in California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington, with a peak gust of recorded near Benton, Nevada. On December 12, an EF0-rated tornado struck Los Angeles. It was the most significant Los Angeles tornado since 1983, when a tornado struck the Los Angeles Convention Center. While the rain was not great enough to bring an end to the intense drought affecting the area, it did help to bring some places above average in terms of annual precipitation.  Early January winter storm & cold wave  On December 27, an arctic cold front swung into the Northwestern United States, bringing very cold temperatures behind it. An area of low pressure formed along this front, and was originally weak at first and produced moderate to heavy snowfall in the Northwest through December 28. As it approached the Southwest early on December 29, the low intensified somewhat as it neared the subtropical branch of the jet steam, and slowly began to draw moisture from the Pacific Ocean and the western half of the Gulf of Mexico. This resulted in snowfall totals of up to in the higher elevations, but also moderate to heavy snow in the lower elevations as well. As cold air continued to filter in over warm air into the morning of December 30‚Äì31, freezing rain began to develop across the southwestern parts of Texas, with accumulations up to . The low began to coalesce into a winter storm in the first two days of 2015, as the low began to track to the northeast, its sights set on the Upper Midwest, Ohio Valley, and Northeast. On January 3, the winter storm began to develop thunderstorms along its cold front as it tracked into the Deep South, which was also a threat for tornadoes. The storm began to producing a swath of accumulating snow of anywhere from into the Upper Midwest and Northeast. A wintry mix and freezing rain was the majority of the precipitation in southwestern New England; however, areas to the south received rain. The storm system then gradually moved out into Canada by January 4. While bringing a wide swath of wintry weather from coast to coast, the winter storm also brought along with it a cold wave, in which some places broke record low temperatures. On January 1, 2015, Los Angeles experienced a record low of , a temperature matched in Pasadena, where the Tournament of Roses Parade was not the coldest in history as forecasters had expected. On January 8, Estcourt Station, Maine was the coldest place in the United States with . Montpelier, Vermont had a record low of , and Jackson, Kentucky was . Schools closed in Portland, Maine and Chicago. In New York City the temperature was , with a wind chill of . Nearly 2000 flights were delayed, and 500 cancelled. Washington, D.C. had delays when railroads froze. In Pittsburgh, two baby African penguins at the National Aviary had to go inside.  Late January blizzard  A winter storm which affected much of the Northeastern United States as viewed on January 26 On January 23, a low-pressure area developed off the Pacific Northwest, before quickly moving over the Canadian Prairies by January 24. The storm system quickly moved southeastward into the Upper Midwest during the evening of January 24, taking a path typical of an Alberta clipper. As it progressed southward, the storm intensified, with frontogenesis occurring the next day. By noon on January 25, the upper-level low was centered near the border between Iowa and Missouri in correlation with a weak shortwave trough. Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico wrapped around the system from the south, resulting in widespread rainfall and snow over the Midwest. Throughout the day, the system traversed eastward along the Kentucky-Tennessee border. Snowfall remained concentrated along a cold front north of the Ohio River. At 09:00 UTC on January 26, the Weather Prediction Center began issuing storm summaries on the developing disturbance while the low-pressure system was centered near Bluefield, West Virginia. At the time, mixed precipitation was occurring over northern Appalachia. As this system tracked eastward, it gradually weakened; however, at the same time, a new low pressure formed off the coast of North Carolina and began to track north-northeastward, eventually becoming the dominant low of the storm. Early on January 30, the nor'easter left the East Coast, even as another winter storm began to impact the region.  Late January‚Äìearly February blizzard  Snow-covered cars in Chicago A major winter storm occurred from January 31 ‚Äì February 2, bringing blizzard conditions to the Chicago area with of snow, being the fifth-largest snowfall in city history. Detroit received , the third-largest recorded total and largest storm in 40 years. Over a foot of snow was reported in locations in Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, and Wisconsin. At least of snow fell near Toronto. Some parts of the Northeast received up to two feet of snow from this storm, as a heavy band of snow stalled over Southern New England. However, widespread amounts of between 10 and 15 inches were much more the norm.  Early February winter storm  On February 8, Boston experienced its fourth winter storm in as many weeks, with added to already on the ground, the most ever. Already, the city had set a record snow amount for seven days. Boston had received in a month, surpassing the previous record of from February 1978. Governor of Massachusetts Charlie Baker declared a state of emergency, and MBTA subway and commuter rail trains were suspended on February 10.  February cold wave  Throughout nearly the entire month of February, extreme cold plagued the eastern half of the nation. Multiple blasts of arctic air associated with the polar vortex dove into the Northeast, but the coldest was the shot of arctic air that brought the coldest air recorded over portions of the eastern Great Lakes in decades on February 15, and possibly over the entire forecast record. Well below normal temperatures covered a large portion of the eastern United States and were expected to stay in place, with only slight moderation, through the rest of the month.Paul, Don (February 5, 2015). Why it's so gosh darned cold and why it will stay that way for some time to come . WIVB-TV. Retrieved February 15, 2015. Through February 21, primarily on February 16 and February 20, over 600 record low temperatures were recorded in the eastern U.S., including all-time record lows and record lows for February. As of February 15, Lake Erie had 94 percent ice cover while Lake Superior and Lake Huron were over 80 percent covered, and Lakes Michigan and Ontario were between 50 and 60 percent iced over.  Mid-February blizzard  From February 14‚Äì15, the Northeast experienced yet another winter storm, with Boston receiving over of snow. Other locations around Massachusetts received up to , bringing the total snowfall up to almost in some areas. Residents of Boston and surrounding areas were urged to stay inside, due to the increasingly dangerous conditions. There were numerous automobile accidents and roofs caving in throughout the Northeast and Midwest, and at least six people were confirmed dead. Parts of the central and southern U.S. received heavy snow and ice. Washington, D.C. received over of snow and parts of the mid-South received of freezing rain. The ice storm caused over 200,000 people to lose power. A second winter storm hit the mid-South on February 25‚Äì26, bringing an additional to of snow much of North Carolina.  Late February‚Äìearly March winter storms  * Note: The above article is on the fourth and final winter storm of this series of systems. In the last week of February into the first week of March, four separate winter storms impacted areas from western Texas to the Northeast, all which included a messy swath of snow and ice. The first winter storm occurred on the weekend of February 20‚Äì22. During this time period, a weak area of low pressure formed in the central parts of the U.S, and began to track eastward. Precipitation was at first relatively scattered, but as the day went on it began to blossom, reaching the Mid-Atlantic by the evening of February 21. There was more ice then snow in this system, and as a result, periods of freezing rain and sleet were expected in a swath extending from North Carolina to Long Island, with ice accumulations ranging from , and snow accumulations of . This system moved off the coast early on February 22. The second winter storm focused on the South and Southeast on February 25‚Äì26. A stationary front coalesced into an area of low pressure in the center of Louisiana, and moved to the east. Originally composed of all rain, snow began to break out on the northern side of the winter storm due to cold air beginning to penetrate into the Deep South. It consisted of wet snow, which would cause numerous power outages. Heavy snowbands also began to set up, which was the result of heavy accumulations ranging from in eastern North Carolina. The winter storm also produced a small but potent line of thunderstorms in the Florida Peninsula, as such a tornado watch was issued. The system began to accelerate somewhat as it began to emerge off the Southeast coast early on February 26, as snow continued to fall into the southern parts of the Mid-Atlantic. The third in the series of winter storms happened from February 28 into late March 1, and spread a swath of snow and ice from the High Plains to New England. The system organized from an upper-level impulse associated with a developing southward dip in the jet stream, which led to the formation of a weak area of low pressure. This weak disturbance began to develop a stripe of snow from the Midwest to the Ohio Valley, and it began to push into the Northeast as the sluggish winter storm tracked to the east. Snowfall was sometimes heavy at times, with snowfall rates of up to 2 inches per hour, but didn't last long. Freezing rain also began to develop in the Mid-Atlantic, setting the stage for more ice accumulations. As the snow moved to the east, warm air began to run over the cold air in place over the Mid-Atlantic, and snow changed over to a mix of freezing rain and sleet by evening on March 1 in areas near Maryland and southern New Jersey. Ice accumulations ranged from , and snow totals in a swath from the Midwest near Illinois to southern New England. The entire wintry mess moved off by mid-morning on March 2. The fourth and final winter storm came right on the heels of the previous system, and actually occurred in two phases, with the latter bringing record cold in its wake. It occurred from March 3‚Äì5, and brought up to a foot of snow in the Northeast, while also causing multiple travel issues and/or delays. One such included a pileup on Interstate 65 in Kentucky, where some people were stranded for many hours.

The present manor house was built in 1891 by John Manners-Sutton, 3rd Baron Manners (1852‚Äì1927). Avon Tyrrell was built as a calendar house with 365 windows (representing the days), 52 rooms (weeks), 12 chimneys (months), 7 external doors (days per week), and 4 wings (seasons). History At some time after the Norman Conquest of 1066 and after the compilation of the Domesday Book of 1086, the manor of Avon, in the New Forest, a royal hunting forest, was held by the Peverell family, which held it until the mid-14th century. In 1363 Sir Henry Peverell died seised of the nearby manor of Milton, leaving a son and heir Thomas Peverell, who in 1365 granted it to Sir Thomas Tyrrell. Thenceforth, Avon and Milton descended in the Tyrrell family. Members of this family included: Sir John Tyrrell (c. 1382‚Äì1437) of Heron in the parish of East Horndon, Essex, Knight of the Shire for Essex, Speaker of the House of Commons, and Treasurer of the Royal Household. Although the Tyrrell family was not connected with the manor until the mid-14th century, legend has connected the name with the 11th century Norman Walter Tirel, who in 1100 in the New Forest accidentally shot dead with an arrow King William II (1087‚Äì1100). The legend states that Tirel fled, fearing being accused of murder and regicide, and crossed the River Avon at a ford in this location, known as Tyrrell's Ford. In 1602 the manor of Avon Tyrrell was sold by his descendant John Tyrrell to Bennett Wynchecombe and Giles Tooker, who sold it to Sir John Webb, 1st Baronet (d.1680),Victoria County History, Hampshire, Volume 5, London, 1912, pp.127-132, Parishes: Sopley of Odstock, Wiltshire (created a baronet in 1644), son of Sir John Webb, knight, of Odstock and of Great Canford, Dorset, by his second wife Catharine Tresham, daughter of Sir Thomas Tresham, of Rushton, Northamptonshire.http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk His descendant Sir John Webb, 5th Baronet (d.1797) sold it to Edward Buckley Batson, a banker, and Stanlake Batson.Victoria County History The heir of Stanlake Batson was his sister Anne Batson, wife of Henry Fane (1739-1802), MP, of Fulbeck Hall, Lincolnshire, the second son of Thomas Fane, 8th Earl of Westmorland (1701‚Äì1771). Avon Tyrrell was inherited by her second son Rev. Edward Fane, and passed to his eldest son Lt Col. Henry Hamlyn-Fane (1817‚Äì1868), whose mural monument is in Clovelly Church, who married Susan Hester Hamlyn-Williams, the heiress of Clovelly in Devon, and who adopted the additional surname \\"Hamlyn\\". in 1912 Avon Tyrrell was the property of one of his daughters Miss Eveline Harriet Hamlyn-Fane, and passed to Eveline's sister Constance Hamlyn-Fane, wife of John Manners-Sutton, 3rd Baron Manners (1852‚Äì1927). Lady Manner's childless sister Christine Hamlyn had inherited Clovelly, and had intended to bequeath it to her eldest niece Mary Christine Manners, who unexpectedly died at the age of 17. She thus left it instead to Mary's younger sister Betty Constance Manners, wife of Arthur Asquith, 3rd son of the Prime Minister H. H. Asquith (1852‚Äì1928).Lauder, Rosemary, Devon Families, Tiverton, 2002, pp. 131‚Äì136, Rous of Clovelly The 3rd Baron Manners won the 1882 Grand National as owner, trainer and rider of his horse Seaman, for which triple feat he won a large sum from a wager, and in 1891 used the proceeds to rebuild Avon Tyrrell House, to the design of the architect W. R. Lethaby.Further reading: Country Life Magazine, June 11th 1910, main article: Avon Tyrrell, Christchurch in Hampshire, The Seat of Lord Manners The house is now a grade I listed building considered to be one of the archetypal Arts & Crafts buildings. His eldest son Francis Manners, 4th Baron Manners (1897‚Äì1972) inherited Avon Tyrrell. It was requisitioned by the government during World War II and the family decided not to return to it after the war (in 1968 the residence of the 4th Baron was nearby Tyrrell's Ford, Christchurch, HampshireDebrett's Peerage, 1968, p.737).

History At some time between 1992 and 1996, Knoxville's channel 32 began as W32BQ. For its first few years on the air, it served as a locally based owned-and-operated translator of the Trinity Broadcasting Network, repeating the signal of flagship KTBN-TV in Santa Ana, California.TV Factbook 1997, page B-266. At some point in 1997, the station was sold to Tiger Eye Broadcasting Corporation. After the sale was finalized, the station changed the call letters to the current WEEE-LP. At that time, the station began serving as Knoxville's original affiliate of UPN from 1997 until 2004. During that time, in order to fill the programming day outside of UPN's primetime programming, the station also had a secondary affiliation with FamilyNet and, beginning in 2001, Urban America Television. The station shared the affiliations with both UATV and FamilyNet with Heiskell-licensed WFEM-LP (channel 12) to make all FamilyNet and UATV programming available. On June 28, 2004, the station dropped all three affiliations, including UPN; this made WVLT-DT2 (digital channel 34.2/virtual channel 8.2, now a MyNetworkTV affiliate) the sole UPN affiliate for the remainder of that network's operating years. June 2004 also marked the event of WEEE-LP becoming an independent station focusing mainly on professional wrestling and boxing programming.

Dickons received her training under Venanzio Rauzzini and she appeared in one of his operas, La vestale, in 1787 at the King's Theatre and then at Vauxhall Gardens.Maria Dickons, National Portrait Gallery, London, retrieved 21 December 2014 By the time she married in 1800 she had appeared in Dublin, Edinburgh and Covent Garden where she had been paid eight pounds per annum. Unfortunately her new husbands trading was not as successful as her singing so she returned to the stage for financial reasons in 1807. She and her husband separated in 1810. Between 1807 and 1815 she appeared at prime locations in London, but her forays to Paris and Italy met with undocumented or mixed success. It is suspected that she was demoted in Venice, but she used her time valuably and she created a large multi-volume collection of Italian vocal music which she brought back to Britain.

The complex consists of a four-story frame building built in 1893 and expanded in 1941, with two four-story brick buildings built in 1907 and 1912. At the time of its listing the mill retained most of the original machinery. The mill closed as a business in 1972 and was converted to 28 residential condominiums in 1987. The mill is currently managed by the Historic Wafco Mills Condominium Association. This historic property was originally constructed as the home of the milling enterprise North, Watson and Company. The earliest component of the complex is three stories tall, constructed of timber and covered in wood clapboards in 1893. Subsequent phases added in 1907 and 1912 were of brick construction and increasingly elaborate design. The 1912 phase is the most elaborate, featuring segmental arched windows, brick corbels, and a stepped parapet gable. The history of the mill is associated with the Watson family. The mill produced a variety of flour, cornmeal and feeds and operated under the same family management for more than four generations. The complex was abandoned in 1972, leaving its future in doubt until developers proposed converting the buildings to residential use in 1984. Architects preserved charming features and materials including exposed brick walls and structural timbers. They created twenty- eight unique living units that were instantly successful. Wafco Mills is a touchstone to the industrial and commercial development of Greensboro as a well-preserved example of late nineteenth and early twentieth century industrial construction development. Its collection of milling machinery remained largely intact at the time of Greensboro's most interesting residences. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 and designated a Guilford County Landmark Property in 1995.

He was known under his solo stage name as Garbage Composal and completed an album's worth of material before finding a bassist named Serana Andersen to form Radio Moscow in 2003. When recording, Griggs would play both guitar and drums. However, the band were known as a trio due to various live drummers joining the band as tour members. After the duo relocated to Colorado, Griggs managed to hand a demo to The Black Keys frontman Dan Auerbach. Radio Moscow were then helped by Auerbach in getting signed to Alive Naturalsound Records. The band then returned to Iowa and new bassist Luke McDuff was brought in. Griggs and McDuff then recorded the band's debut album in 2006, with Auerbach handling production duties. Radio Moscow was released in February 2007. In April 2009, the band self-produced their second studio album Brain Cycles. In 2011, Griggs produced The Great Escape of Leslie Magnafuzz by himself and in 2012 3 & 3 Quarters was released which featured Griggs only. This is because the material from the album was written and recorded before the formation of Radio Moscow. Griggs then released Magical Dirt with Radio Moscow in June 2014. Alongside Mario Rubalcaba of Earthless, and fellow Radio Moscow Member, Paul Marrone, Griggs founded Alpine Fuzz Society, a side project from Radio Moscow, with intentions of playing more Garage Rock oriented music. Style Reviewing the band's self-titled album for music website AllMusic, Greg Prato of AllMusic described the group's sound as \\"a throwback to the classic rock of the '70s\\", comparing certain songs to artists such as Ram Jam, The Allman Brothers Band and The Jeff Beck Group.

Zeta  The first printing house Pahomije worked at was the Crnojeviƒá printing house in Obod, Rijeka Crnojeviƒáa, in the period of 1494‚Äì96. There he learned printing skills from hieromonk Makarije and practicised it until ƒêuraƒë Crnojeviƒá fled Zeta and went to Venice in 1496. Pahomije was one of eight printers who worked at the Crnojeviƒá printing house.  Venice  In 1518 Bo≈æidar Vukoviƒá invited Pahomije to come to Venice and organize the printing at the printing press of Vukoviƒá. Pahomije accepted this invitation and went to Venice. Pahomije was head of the organization of work at the printing house, and also worked as an editor and corrector there. The printing house was operational in two periods, 1519/1520‚Äì21 and 1536‚Äì40. During the first period Pahomije printed three books, a book of hours (ƒåaslovac, or Psaltir) in 1519, Liturgijar and Molitvenik. In March 1520 he wrote on the cover of one of the books he printed that he was \\"from the islands of the Diocletian Lake\\" . In a 1544 document he wrote reka instead of rijeka (Rijeka Crnojeviƒáa), concluding that he hailed from an Ekavian accent region (somewhere in modern Serbia), however, in some later works this assumption was rejected.

History  A number of local Cretan organizations had been established in the United States in the 1910s and 1920s, such as the Omonia in New York City, Arkadi of Pittsburgh and Epimenides of San Francisco. On April 7, 1929 these groups met at the Omonia in New York to set up a preparatory committee to found a general federation of Cretan clubs. On October 14 of that year a convention was held in Chicago with representatives of the above groups as well as the Cretan Fraternity of Chicago, Minos of Salt Lake City, Psilorites of Detroit, Mutual Benefit of Cleveland and Minos of Chicopee. The delegates founded the Pancretan Association of America. KPHTH the newsletter of Omonia was adopted as the national publication. Women's were established the following years in several cities. By 2010 several of the women's chapters merged with their local men's chapters. In 2015 there are only 8 women's chapters. In 1948 a movement began to organize Cretan Youth chapters. The organization was informal and by the late 1950s only one youth chapter (in New York City) remained. A second revival of youth chapters began in 1970 and the Pancretan Youth Association (PYA) was formally established in 1971. By 2015 there were 14 active PYA chapters.  Organization  The official headquarters is in Astoria, New York City, but the association does not have any permanent facility there. The operating headquarters is the location of the president. A national convention meets every two years; in the interim it has elected officers and a board of directors. In June 2015 the association had 3,100 members in 78 local chapters, including youth and women's chapters in seven districts. The Pancretan Association is an association of chapters. Members of a chapter are automatically, in effect, members of the association. For most all chapters, a membership is open to \\"individuals of Cretan lineage and their spouses.\\" However, a few chapters do allow \\"friends of Crete,\\" usually limited to 5 percent of the total membership, to be full members, while some of these chapters do not permit such members to be president.  Purpose  The primary purpose is to maintain and promote the Cretan culture and values, and to a lesser extent, the modern Greek culture, among its members here in America. The programs to accomplish this are centered on philanthropy and on education. The association has a large scholarship program and grants thousands of dollars annually to educational and philanthropic institutions and programs in Crete and the United States.

Up to date Kermit have released two studio albums titled Autoficci√≥n (Spanish for 'Autofiction'; 2012) and Litoral (Spanish for 'Coast'; 2014) through Spanish music label Itaca Records.  Bio  Kermit was formed in the summer of 2010 in M√°laga by former components of several local bands such as Parcel, White Coffee, Seattle Apples and Sat√©lites. Gonzalo, Miguel and Francisco began to write the songs that would later be included in Kermit's debut album, and Alvaro joined the band behind the drums when the album was almost completely written. Alvaro also plays the drums and percussion in Proyecto Parada.  Autoficci√≥n  Kermit released their debut album titled Autoficci√≥n in November 2012 with label Itaca Records in CD, vinyl and name-your-price download through the label's website and German netlabel PiN Musik's Bandcamp. It is an 11-track album in which, in words of the band themselves, they play \\"with the endless possibilities offered by two guitars, a bass and a drumkit\\". The album was recorded in Dune 2.0 studios with sound engineer Sergio Cascales, assisted by the band's guitar player ‚ÄîGonzalo Presa. \\"Kermit's production draws its influences from multiple sources, from Radiohead to even Refused or At the Drive-In, including the heterogeneous names of Portishead, Sonic Youth, Mogwai and Pink Floyd, yet without neglecting other artistic expressions such as literature or films.\\" \\"The album title itself indicates that literature plays a relevant role in the band's imagery, and idea confirmed by the album's CD and vinyl leaflets. South-American authors such as Cort√°zar, Borges and Bola√±o seem those most relevant to the band, but Kafka, Rimbaud or Valle-Incl√°n can also be traced easily, surely forming part of the band members' personal libraries. Films, architecture and graphic design are other sources for their influences.\\" In fact, the album cover is \\"the visual poem Sion by Ces√°rea Tinajero, the poetess the main characters in Bola√±o's The Savage Detectives look for throughout the whole novel. Autoficci√≥n is about the idea of the travel and discovery of new, not necessarily exterior, places.\\" As a premi√®re of the album, the fragment corresponding to the track titled \\"Cocaine\\" was extracted from a live sessions recorded in HD video at the Instituto Polit√©cnico Jes√∫s Mar√≠n High School, completed by students from vocational courses on Sound Engineering and Image. These full sessions, including 8 tracks from Kermit's debut album, were published some months later through YouTube under the title IPJM Sessions. After the presentation of the band in La Casa Invisible on April 14 and of Autoficci√≥n in Teatro Echegaray on October 22, album release was followed by a brief Andalusian tour with Madrid band Autumn Comets, including visits to Don Benito and Madrid. In the summer of 2012 Kermit were shortlisted in the Wild Weekend contest and won third prize in M√°laga Crea for the category of pop-rock. Kermit also played the SMS Festival in the summer of 2013 in Centro de Arte Contempor√°neo de M√°laga.  Litoral  Kermit released their second album, titled Litoral, in April 2014. It is a tribute to the homonymous literary journal created by poets Manuel Altolaguirre and Emilio Prados in M√°laga in 1926, as well as to Imprenta Sur. Litoral is considered the main expression means of the so-called Generation of '27. Indeed, it is the journal's current director and graphic designer, Emilio Prados' great-grandson, Lorenzo Saval, who is in charge of the album's graphic design and illustration, being again released in CD and vinyl formats through Itaca Records' website, and in name-your-price download through Bandcamp and SoundCloud. The band themselves have expressed their intention of the album being understood \\"as an additional issue of this poetry and thought journal, yet a sound one\\", since its 7 tracks go on uninterruptedly from the opener \\"1926\\" to the closer \\"1927\\", years which correspond to the first stage of the Litoral journal, which comprised its 9 first issues. Litoral is an album in which Kermit complete \\"a trip through psychedelia, post-rock, impossible passages and the most absorbing adventure. [...] transcending the musical sphere, mixing literature, philosophy and other artistic fields [...] [in which] more or less classic structures lie the foundation for more hypnotic parts. Some stretches get close to progressive rock, while some others are just pure jazz.‚Äù ‚ÄúRelative to their debut, Litoral is an album more focused on jazz than on instrumental rock, although without losing that essence of rhythm changes and epic crescendos. Litoral runs seamlessly for 45 minutes, intertwining small jewels that include psychodelia (\\"Samhain\\") or electronica in up-tempo tracks (\\"Magnitizdat\\"), where the rhythm base mixes with spoken word and an improvised saxophone line.‚Äù ‚ÄúLitoral cannot therefore be understood but as a further step toward a junction of influences that is perhaps lighted so much by Tortoise as by King Crimson, Slint or Radiohead, yet cinematographically told.‚Äù \\"Litoral is a step forward in so many levels, mainly in music writing, because tracks such as \\"Samhain\\", \\"Circumpolares\\" and \\"Magnitizdat\\" are simply incredibly delicious, particularly the last one. However, it also means creative growth, since the elements which made their debut album so interested are powered here, yet everything seems under control at all times. There is post-rock, of course, but there is also more of King Crimson, more jazz, more electronica and even spoken word.\\" Litoral again contains numerous literary hints. Indeed, its 45 minutes echo verses and lines by Allen Ginsberg, George Orwell and Roberto Bola√±o, as well as by local poets Ra√∫l D√≠az Rosales and bass player Francisco Trujillo. As they did with their debut album, Litoral was presented with a video single (\\"Magnitizdat\\") extracted from live sessions at La Caverna de Amores, recorded in collaboration with La Trinchera Audiovisuales. The extracts corresponding to the tracks ‚ÄúWe-tripantu‚Äù and ‚ÄúCircumpolares‚Äù (the album's fourth and third tracks, respectively) were also published on YouTube in 2014. The album was presented live on April 26 in Auditorio Edgar Neville, in \\"a melancholic trip full of poetry, light and beauty\\", which was followed by a tour that took them to Algeciras, C√°diz, Seville, Ja√©n and Don Benito. On October 9 Litoral was presented in Teatro Echegaray with the support of art and design through projections by Calde Ram√≠rez (Music Komite).

Early life Forgues was born in the village of Mi√©lan on 10 August 1761. His father, Jean Pierre Fourgues was a local merchant and his mother, Marie Magdaleine Babart belonged to a merchant family form the village of Montesquieu. Little is known of his early years, but he belonged to an established middle class merchant family who ensured he had a good education so he would be able to fulfil his future role in the family business. Military service When revolutionary fervour swept the Midi-Pyr√©n√©es in 1792, Forgues felt compelled to join the newly formed Regiment du Gers. His education soon made him stand out from amongst his fellow volunteers and on 21 June 1792 he was appointed a captain in the 3eme Batallion du Gers, also called the Lectoure battalion. He was soon noticed for his zeal and his ability and was made adjutant to the Etat Majeur (General Staff) of the Army of the Occidental Pyrenees in September 1792. Transferring from the infantry to the cavalry, he was promoted to captain in the 24eme Chasseurs a Cheval on the 1er Germinal Year 2 (22 March 1793), he reported to his regiment, stationed in Bayonne which formed part of the Army of the Occidental Pyrenees. With his regiment, and also while attached to the Etat Majeur of the Army, he saw active service at the battle of the Baztan Valley and later at the battle of Orbaitzeta. The harsh winter of 1794-1795 General Moncey, commander of the Army of the Occidental Pyrenees reorganised his troops and waited for reinforcements for the coming campaign. Disease and lack of equipment and food reduced the troops by some 3,000 soldiers. Forgues was ill during the winter but recovered to continue his duties on the Etat Majeur. In June 1795 Moncey launched his attack on the Spanish forces, Forgues was present at the capture of Vitoria on 17 July. In August 1795 the Treaty of Basel ended the war between revolutionary France and Spain. Suffering from illness and campaign fatigue Forgues was sent on leave to recover at his home in Mielan. He was given leave of absence during 1796. He re-joined the 24eme chasseurs in 1796 when they were ordered to join the Army of Italy. He was transferred to the 12eme Chasseurs a Cheval by Ministerial order on 6 Germinal Year 6 (26 March 1798). He served with his regiment, which was attached to General Schauenburg's division which took part in the operations to \\"pacify\\" the Swiss and the subsequent occupation of Switzerland. One Squadron was cantoned in Zurich, the rest were stationed at Winterthur. In March 1799 the regiment and the rest of the Army of Helvetia were placed under the command of General Mass√©na. The 12th Chasseurs served throughout the 1799 campaign in Switzerland. Forgues distinguished himself in action and was promoted to chef d'escadron on 1st Fructidor year 7 (18 August 1799). On 1st Germinal year 8 (22 March 1800), Forgues was appointed to act as Aide de Camp to General Dessolles and ordered to report to his new chief in the Army of the Rhine. General Dessolles was Chief of General Staff of the Army of the Grisons under General Moreau. Forgues served with General Dessolles throughout the campaign of 1800 and 1801. The most important action of the period was the battle of Hohenlinden, fought on 3 December 1800. As ADC to the Chief of General Staff, Forgues was kept very busy throughout the battle. He appears in the painting of the battle that hangs in the Gallerie des Batailles in Versailles. Forgues was with General Dessolles throughout the campaign until the Treaty of Lun√©ville, signed on 20th Pluviose, year 9 (9 February 1801) ended the conflict. General Dessolles was named a Conseiller d'Etat attached to the War Office and later appointed to the Administrative Council of the War Office. His ADC, Forgues did not accompany him to Paris, but remained with the Army of the Rhine, serving with General Mortier who was ordered to occupy Hanover, as stipulated by the Convention of Sulingen, signed on 3 June 1803. Forgues played an active part in the troops movements that led to the complete occupation of Hanover and the disarming and dissolution of the Hanoverian Army. He formed part of the occupying garrison during 1804. On 12 August 1804 he was awarded the L√©gion d'honneur, which was registered in the War Ministry in Paris on 21 February 1805. When Napoleon formed the Grande Arm√©e, and reorganised his army structure, Forgues was employed as ADC on the L'√©tat- major g√©n√©ral of the Grand Armee from 20 July 1806 to 2 July 1808. With the war of the Fourth Coalition starting in 1806 and being primarily fought in Germany, Poland and the Russian frontier, Forgues found himself serving in Marshal Ney's corps, which was detached from Murat's forces to besiege and obtain the surrender of the Prussian forces of General von Kleist that had sought refuge in Magdeburg. The siege lasted from 25 October to 8 November 1806, the Prussians capitulating and evacuating the fortress on 11 November 1806. Marshal Ney established a garrison in the city, Forgues was made Comandant d'armes of the garrison at Magdeburg. He remained at Magdeburg carrying out his duties until the Kingdom of Westphalia was formed in November 1807 and J√©r√¥me Bonaparte was made its king. Forgues then rejoined the L'√©tat- major g√©n√©ral of the Grand Armee and continued to serve as an ADC. His health having suffered from campaigning and from wounds received in battle, he returned to Meilan to recover. He was in his village when Napoleon and Josephine passed on their return from Bayonne following the Spanish Abdication crisis in May 1808. On his return trip to Paris, the Emperor stopped at Mielan, where he was greeted by a triumphal arch of flowers and greenery, which was erected on the corner of Fourges's house and spanned the road. A welcome committee formed by the Mayor and the dignitaries of the village were there as well as the population, including Fourges. Forgues was still listed as active on L'√©tat-major g√©n√©ral until 2 July 1808. He was retired from active service and remained in Mielan, where he married twice and had a family. For his loyal services to France, he was rewarded by Napoleon who made him a Knight of the Legion of Honour. Later life From 1813 to 1815 Forgues was in Tarbes, where he held the post of Entreposeur Principal of the department of Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es. This was a government administrative post where he supervised all the moments of state regulated goods (i.e. tobacco). In 1816 Fourges returned to Meilan, where he wrote to the Minister of War and requested his Imperial Legion of Honour with its privileges, being confirmed by the restored Louis XVIII.

History and Community Rudolf Steiner, founder of anthroposophy and Waldorf schoolsIn the mid-1950s, a group of interested individuals came to Christoph Lindner, a former official physician at the Swiss Consulate in New York City and a member of the Swiss Benevolent Association, to form the Fellowship Committee within the Anthroposophical Society of America. The committee came into being for the needs of some elderly members. This was the initiative that led to the Fellowship Community. After Paul Scharff took the helm, the Fellowship Community was created in 1966 in Spring Valley, New York. Soon after, the Fellowship, having grown, began to support Weleda financially, becoming a shareholder. Dr. Paul Scharff died in 2014 at the age of 83, but the Fellowship is still strong. The Fellowship is now a long-term care community. With more than 150 members, children and co- workers, the Fellowship Community is in a rural setting of farm, orchards, and forests only 45 minutes by public transportation to New York City. It has a candle shop, a homeopathic and alternative medical office, now headed by Dr. Gerald Karnow, M.D., a weavery, a woodworking-shop, and a metal-shop. The Community is \\"A rich, varied cultural-spiritual life is woven into the community with festivals, art programs, lectures and trips. There is much work (play for the child) and social interaction, allowing for growth and human unfolding.\\" The Fellowship Community was founded with the ideas and ideals of the Kibbutz Movement, where every one does everything. > Here, everybody does everything. A doctor doesn‚Äôt just treat his patients > but scrubs toilets, milks cows, too, always something different. This > prevents the burnouts that happen in many other workplaces. Kibbutz, in Hebrew, means group. A kibbutz is a \\"voluntary democratic community where people live and work together on a non-competitive basis. Its aim is to generate an economically and socially independent society founded on principles of communal ownership of property, social justice, and equality.\\" The larger community includes the Green Meadow Waldorf School and the Hungry Hollow Co-op. Duryea Farm The Fellowship Community operates the Duryea farm, an organic and biodynamic farm. With a small herd of about eight Jersey cows, as well as sheep, chickens and honeybees, ten acres of vegetables, 250 apple trees, and thirty acres of pasture and hay fields, the farm produces much of the Fellowship's food. The farm is also home to one of the two off- campus kindergartens from Green Meadow Waldorf School. Here the children feed the chickens, sing songs, and grow pumpkins. When Jean Durier (‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôDuryea‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, in all its different spellings, means \\"dwelling by the river,\\") came to the United States from France in 1688, he bought land where the Duryea farm now is. Eight generations later, John Howard Duryea (b. 1939) sold the thirty- three acres of farm to the growing Fellowship Community. At the time it was the only organic farm in Rockland County. The Hand and Hoe Selling freshly made pizza, bread, soup, and cookies, freshly harvested vegetables, ice cream, and hand made gifts and crystals, the Hand and Hoe is open every Friday afternoon from noon till five. The Mercury Press The Mercury Press, started in the 1970s, is a small publishing and print house at the Fellowship. They publish many of Rudolf Steiner's significant lectures, translated from German and printed in English. The Otto Specht School The Otto Specht School logoThe Fellowship Community also is home to the Otto Specht School. The school, with a student-to-teacher ratio of five to one, was founded for \\"difficult\\" students \\"with developmental delays, learning differences, alternative learning styles, and sensory and social sensitivities.\\" The school takes its name from Dr. Otto Specht, a pupil of Rudolf Steiner, who, with his numerous learning differences, was considered \\"uneducatable\\".

He received numerous awards throughout his academic and professional career. He is also known as an academic for his early publications surrounding his findings of leprosy of which he published about 150 articles and five books. Early life and education Browne was born on 8 December 1907 in New Cross London. His father was the local post office clerk and Baptist church secretary. Browne attended Brockley Central School where he excelled and won many awards highlighting his academic achievements; however, he dropped at age 15 in order earn his living working as clerk at the Deptford town hall. He took evening classes in order to pass matriculation. He then attended King's College London with scholarships for both his studies of medicine as well as theology. As a student at King's College, he received awards for his academic achievements such as the Barry, Leathes and Warneford prizes, the Warneford Gold Metal, the Jeff Medal, and later: distinctions in surgery, forensic medicine, and hygiene. He received the Murchison Scholarship for most outstanding medical graduate. After graduating with high medical honors, he went to Antwerp for another year of study to obtain a diploma in tropical medicine. During this time, he also became fluent in French. He became a member of the Royal College of Physicians in 1934 and the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1935. Personal life Browne met his wife Marion (Mali) Williamson on holiday in England in 1939. She was born in China as the daughter of two Baptist missionaries and her father was the General Foreign Secretary of the Baptist Mission House. She graduated from Oxford University and worked as teacher. They became engaged after their third meeting. The onset of World War II required Browne to return to the Congo shortly after the two had met. Browne was instructed to continue to maintain the health of the Congolese, who were involved in the mining of many metals, especially Uranium, that were contributing to the Allies' war effort. Despite their geographical separation, Browne and Williamson continued their relations until she was able to join him permanently in the Congo late in 1940. They married at Yakusu on 15 November 1940. Their three sons, Derek, Alastair and Christopher, were all born at Yakusu. Derek, their eldest son, was born in 1942, followed by Alastair in 1946 and Christopher in 1947. Although born in the Congo, from the age of three Derek lived in Britain and was raised by relatives. He attended boarding school at Eltham College. Alastair and Christopher were raised at Yakusu until old enough to attend boarding school at Eltham. Browne also had a sister, Winifred, who worked as a nurse alongside him at Yakusu. Missionary Journey Browne accredits his interest in pursuing a medical career to the kindness and attention his mother received from doctors near the end of her life. His aspirations to become a missionary began at a young age when he heard Henry Holman Bentley, the first white child born in the Congo, speak at a London Sunday School. Responding to \\"an urgent need for new recruits\\", Browne, \\"made up his mind to offer his services as a doctor to the Baptist Missionary Society\\". After he graduated medical school, he spent an additional year studying for a tropical medicine diploma in Belgium. Following his year in Belgium, Browne began his journey to the medical mission at Yakusu mission station in the Belgian Congo. After sailing to Matadi, he rode the then recently created Congo Ocean Railway 228 miles to Leopoldville. Upon arrival in Leopoldville, he received further tropical medicine training and met his predecessor, Dr. Clement Chesterman and fellow missionary Dr. Raymond Holmes. After taking time to adjust to the equatorial climate and further his studies, Browne travelled by air to the mission station in Yakusu. A strong storm while in flight caused for a near plane crash, but Brown and his counterparts were ultimately able to land safely. The final part of the journey to Yakusu hospital was made by canoe. Browne arrived in what would become his new home ready to begin his experiences as a medical missionary in April 1936. Missionary work From 1936 to 1958, Browne dedicated himself to the mission hospital at Yakusu, Belgian Congo. At Yakusu, he performed a wide range of roles from treating disease outbreaks and researching diseases to performing operations to midwifery. Patients with a wide variety of ailments arrived from surrounding areas daily to seek care. He frequently handled outbreaks of smallpox, polio, tuberculosis, malaria, yaws and typhoid and made major breakthroughs in the treatment of leprosy and Onchocerciasis. Browne, who would later concentrate his studies on leprosy, was the one of the first doctors to use Dapsone in the treatment of leprosy. He made a major epidemiological breakthrough related to Onchocerciasis, commonly known as river blindness, when he discovered it was caused by a black fly that bred on crabs. After having the crabs caught and exterminated and the streams cleaned, 98% of the black fly population had disappeared. Despite being based in Yakusu, following Chesterman's network of community health centers, Browne embarked on frequent expeditions to surrounding dispensaries and mission stations, traveling by car, motor boat, canoe or on foot. The doctors of Yakusu were often called to surrounding areas to provide medical care to acutely ill or injured patients. Browne and his coworkers created a maternity wing and prenatal clinic as part of Yakusu with the goal of reducing high infant mortality rates. Another notable accomplishment was the leprosarium he created and had constructed across the River Congo at Yalisombo. At the leprosarium, he developed a program of community care using over 50 health centers throughout the area he oversaw. This model was adopted in Africa for the control of endemic disease. His work at Yalisombo attracted the attention of a prominent leprologist, Dr. Robert Cochrane, who encouraged him focus his studies on leprosy. During his time at Yakusu, he served as principal of the School of Medical Auxiliaries, developing a model rural health service. In 1958, Browne resigned from the Baptist Missionary Society. He was recruited by the government of the Eastern Region of Nigeria to succeed Dr. Frank Davey as senior leprologist. As a result of his continued contributions to the fight against leprosy, he was known as 'Mr. Leprosy' throughout West Africa. While in Nigeria, he pioneered the use of anti-leprosy drug, clofazimine. Browne returned to England 1965 and used his vast knowledge and research of leprosy to consult for the World Health Organization, International Federation of Anti-Leprosy Association (ILEP), various Christian Medical associations, Mother Teresa's leprosy hospital in Calcutta, and the International Albert Schweitzer Fellowship. Legacy and honours Browne contributed over 500 learned articles to scientific journals over his career. He is most recognized for his contributions to the fields of tropical medicine and leprosy. He served as Secretary of the International Leprosy Association from 1966 to 1984, Director of the Leprosy Study Centre in London 1966 to 1980, President of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 1977 to 1979, and President of the Baptist Union of Great Britain 1980 to 1981. In 1978, he became one of the first three Fellows of King's College Hospital medical school. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1965, \\"awarded to citizens for distinguished service to the arts and sciences, public services outside the Civil Service and work with charitable and welfare organisations of all kinds\\". His honours in Britain were furthered when he was appointed a Commander of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George (CMG) for his work as foreign servant in 1976. In addition to awards garnered in Britain, he was the recipient of three major awards from King Baudouin of Belgium, the most notable being the insignia of Commander of the Order of Leopold. This is the highest honour a civilian can receive in Belgium.

Built-in a grand Baroque style over the 17th and 18th centuries, it now functions as a museum and host for events and meetings. Facade History Galliari fresco of Chariot of Apollo Roman statue Pompey the Great Castellazzo. That castle was acquired in 1610 by Galeazzo Arconati, cousin of Cardinal Federico Borromeo. Galeazzo was a patron of the arts and served as the rector of the Fabbrica del Duomo of Milan. Under Galeazzo's ownership, the castle-palace on the site was reconstructed and refurbished. It was also Galeazzo who, during the year 1621 brought to the structure his collection of ancient Roman sculpture,including a standing statue said to be Pompey the Great,[The Traveller's Guide Of Milan], by Marcello Mazzoni (1838), page 158.but also the remaining fragments of the Renaissance style Funereal Monument of Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours (died 1512) by Agostino Busi.Archivio storico lombardo (1892), page 910. Galeazzo was also at the one-time owner of the Codex Atlanticus of Leonardo da Vinci. The gardens were restructured in 1621. Construction on the site continued after 1648 under grandson's leadership, the Count Luigi Maria Arconati, and in 1671 under his great-grandson Giuseppe Maria Arconati. In 1718, Giuseppe Antonio Arconati, grandson of Giuseppe Maria, inherits the palace. In 1742, the architect Giovanni Ruggeri was employed in embellishments and expansions. The Galliari brothers: Bernardino, Fabrizio, and Giovanni Antonio, were employed in the fresco decoration of the interior of the Villa.

The expressionistic paint rendering and predominant use of red are a visceral interpretation of the persistent and relentless distortion of black imagery in our culture.\\" The gala was attended by her parents, Latanya Richardson Jackson, Samuel L. Jackson, Johnnetta Betsch Cole, and James Staton, among others. In July 2015, Cosby was the curator of a pop- up group art show in artist Jennifer Coates' Brooklyn studio called \\"Eye Contact.\\" It featured art by Cosby along with art from Rina Banerjee, Ellen Gallagher, Nina Chanel Abney, Ella Kruglyanskaya, David Armacost, Lauren Gidwitz, Scott Grodesky, and Ryan Schneider. Cosby stated, \\"I started thinking about eye imagery after watching marchers carrying artist JR‚Äôs banner of Eric Garner‚Äôs cropped eyes.\\" Works by Cosby have been featured in galleries such as SALTWORKS Contemporary Art, the Arlington Arts Center, Slate Gallery, Artspace in New Haven, the Allegra LaViola Gallery, and The Last Brucennial. Cosby is a benefactor of the summer institute for A Long Walk Home, an art-based sexual assault awareness program in Chicago, Illinois.

Description and history The Stone House is set on a rise overlooking both Gothic Street and the busy High Street. It is a 2-1/2 story T-shaped wood frame structure, with a cross gable roof that has one wing of the T slightly longer than the other. The roof is steeply pitched, and all of the gables are decorated with icicle-shaped vergeboard. A porch, recently rebuilt, faithfully reproduces Gothic style woodwork, extending along the street-facing side of the T, to one of the wings. In the east-facing gable, an original first-floor oriel window has been replaced by a picture window, but it has been given a Gothic window surround matching those of other windows. The interior was extensively damaged by fire in the early 1980s, and has retained little original woodwork. The Gothic Revival form is not commonly seen in rural Maine. Henry Rowe, an Irish immigrant based on Portland, was a specialist in the form, and designed a nearly identical house to this one Yarmouth, and another with similar styling in Portland. This house was built for Elisha Stone, who was a local merchant and tailor, and also served for a time as the local postmaster.

Early life  Born in Kingston, to Betty Kawalkiewicz. He was adopted shortly thereafter by John and Nelda Churry. As a young man, Czury grew up in the northeastern Pennsylvania coal mining region near Shamokin, in the Northumberland County, Pennsylvania. Growing up in this area helped Czury identify strongly with the coal region. When Czury was seven-years-old, the Susquehanna River flooded the Knox Anthracite Coal Mine in Luzerne County, the Knox Mine disaster, which killed 12 miners and left thousands of others out of work. The disaster crippled the economic foundation of the area. Loss, abandonment, displacement and leaving would become major themes in his poetry. After he graduated from Dallas High School in Dallas, Pennsylvania, Czury drifted between several colleges and various temporary jobs across the United States. He spent 15 years hitchhiking across the country, working temporarily in carnivals, warehouses, and kitchens. He attended Hiram Scott College and Western Nebraska Community College, both in Scottsbluff, Nebraska. Czury then moved to the University of Montana in Missoula, before attending Wilkes University in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.  Poetry  Czury published his first book of poetry entitled Janus Peeking in 1980. The book received the 1980 First Book Award from the Montana Arts Council. From there, Czury went on to publish 15 more collections of poetry. Czury's work illustrates the pain and emptiness of the depression-stricken Pennsylvania coal-mining region. The following is an excerpt from his poem entitled, ‚ÄúCoalscape:‚Äù all this black dust / black cinder and glass ground up / in the spine of a torn-out trainbed / smoke rising out of birch on the culm bank / when it begins to rain One of his most notable collections is God's Shiny Glass Eye, published in 1987. This collection revolved around Czury's vision of the coal country where he grew up. Critic Michael Basinski is quoted on the FootHills Publishing site as saying, ‚ÄúThe poet‚Äôs imagination and the anthracite world intimately merge to produce a poetry that is poignantly barren and stripped of any artificial embellishment. It is an angry poetry, but its passion is restrained and boils beneath the structure of the book.‚Äùhttp://foothillspublishing.com/pre-2005/id39.htm Much of Czury's work has been spread internationally. His books of poetry have been translated into many different languages, including Spanish,SHADOW/ORPHAN SHADOW ‚Äî SOMBRA/SOMBRA HU√âRFANA,(translated in castillano by Rosann DeCandido and Alicia Partnoy) Pine Press, 1997, Landisburg, Pa.

Czury currently lives in Springville, Pennsylvania. He has worked as a travelling poet in schools, homeless shelters, prisons, mental hospitals, and community centers around the world. He is the editor of the Old School Press Poetry Pamphlet Series, and conducts life-writing and poetry workshops at the Springville Schoolhouse Artist Studios, where he lives, \\"writes and plays harmonicaSaid by Czury during an interview in Italy in January 2015.\\".

W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida Bot. Misc. 14Niebla eburnea reported in Spjut (1996) as far north as Sonoma County; Mendocino County report from images shown and described on Enlichment web page titled Niebla homalea (Ach.) Rundel & Bowler, not all Niebla homalea according to Spjut (1996); Niebla eburnea, 1st and 12th images by Curtis Bj√∂rk (Jughandle State Preserve, Mendocino County, 2011-07-09), 10th image by Jason Hollinger (Navarro State Park, 2007-02-24), a total of 14 images exhibited, 6 species represented. Other images in sequence are of Niebla disrupta (2nd & 12th images, Curtis Bj√∂rk, Jughandle Preserve, 2011-07-09), N. homalea (3rd Jason Hollinger & 8th Curtis Bj√∂rk images, Salt Point State Park, Jughandle State Park, 2007-02-24; 2011-07-09), Vermilacinia procera with Niebla testudinaria (4th image, Pt. Lobos St. Park), Vermilacinia combeoides (5th image), and Niebla cornea (6th, 7th & 9th images) The epithet, eburnea is in reference to the ivory like appearance of the cortex. Distinguishing Features Niebla eburnea is best recognized by the ivory-like cortex, appearing mostly smooth except for the creamy pastry-like ripples or creases, occasionally with transverse cracks; the thallus divided into subterete branches, generally half-twisted near base and often near apex, otherwise branches straight to curved, often with short elliptiform dilated segments, near apex more like the palm of the hand from which various claw-like to finger-like branchlets spread, often blackened around the base to a short distance above. Black dot-like pycnidia common along the margins, their development associated with thickened crinkled margins on the upper parts of branches and lobes. Niebla eburnea is further characterized by the presence of the lichen substance divaricatic acid, along with triterpenes and pigments concentrated near base. The ivory-like cortex of Niebla eburnea is 65‚Äì125 ¬µm thick, in contrast to that of Niebla cornea, 45‚Äì60 ¬µm thick, a similar species that also differs in having the lichen substance sekikaic acid. Although Niebla eburnea can often be distinguished by its morphology, thin-layer-chromatography is a more definitive way to identify the species‚Äîby its lichen substance of divaricatic acid, with accessory triterpenes‚Äîin contrast also to Niebla disrupta, which has sekikaic acid and to species in the genus Vermilacinia that lack the depsides and have distinctive terpenes not found in Niebla; Vermilacinia laevigata and Vermilacinia procera are examples of species that can be confused with N. eburnea. Taxonomic History Niebla eburnea was recognized as distinct from Niebla homalea before it was described. On 30 April 1985 while collecting a minimum 25 gram samples near Cerro Solo in northern Baja California for a biodiversity screening of lichens in the search of new drugs by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Natural Products Branch to treat HIV, it was considered to represent another species that differed from Niebla homalea that had been collected near Punta Banda on the day before (29 April 1985, WBA-277, S & M 9032C, 58 g).Samples of lichens were collected from the Eastern and Western regions of the United States and Baja California, Mexico for anti-HIV screening during 1985. Prior to 1982, samples for antitumor screening were supplied in 1 kilogram (kg) quantity (dried) to the NCI by the USDA Agricultural Research Service. In October 1982, the funding for this cooperative agreement was terminated. World Botanical Associates (WBA) was formed by Richard Spjut in May 1983 to continue to supply samples for antitumor screening. Lichens were considered a potential novel source for new anti-HIV drugs since they had rarely been collected for the NCI antitumor screening program. Richard Spjut, the Senior Partner of WBA, proposed that the NCI reduce their 1 kg quantity to 25 grams in order to obtain a broad diversity of lichen samples. The NCI group maintains an inventory of natural product extracts with details on the collection data. Voucher specimens are deposited at the United States National Herbarium (Smithsonian Institution) and cited in Spjut's 1996 revision of the genus under N. homalea. The sample for Spjut & Marin 9047A was not submitted to the NCI. Instead approximately 40 specimens from the sample were extracted with acetone to identify the lichen substances by thin-layer chromatography. All contained divaricatic acid, with accessory triterpenes. This material then became the type collection for Niebla eburnea, described by Richard Spjut in 1996, and for exsiccati distributed later to other institutions through the ABLS Lichen ExchangeABLS Lichen Exchange, retrieved 21 Dec 2014 that was at Arizona State University. It may be noted that Niebla eburnea has been treated as belonging to a broad spectrum of morphological and chemical variation in Niebla homalea that includes many different species of Niebla and Vermilacinia. This does not mean that Niebla eburnea is an equal synonym (taxonomy) as erroneously indicated by some. This synonymy is based on the subjective interpretation of one taxonomic review of the genusBowler, P. and J. Marsh. 2004.

Life Liddel was born in Aberdeen, Scotland. Having received an education in languages and philosophy at the local school and the University of Aberdeen, he went abroad at age 18. Moving to Gda≈Ñsk in Polish Prussia first, he arrived after a few months at the Viadrina European University (Frankfurt (Oder)), where a Scot, John Craig was teaching logic and mathematics; Craig superintended his studies. Three years later Craig returned to Scotland to become physician to King James VI, and Liddel, on his advice, moved to Breslau in Silesia, where he studied mathematics under Paul Wittich, and encountered Andreas Dudith. In 1584 he returned to Frankfurt, took pupils in mathematics and philosophy, and took up the study of physic. In 1587 an epidemic drove him to the University of Rostock in Mecklenburg, where he became the friend of Johannes Caselius, Heinrich Brucaeus and Cornelius Martini; and received the degree of M.A. in philosophy. With the help of his new contacts, he visited Tycho Brahe in Ven in 1587 and again the following year. Shortly after his return to Frankfurt in 1590, Liddel joined the new University of Helmstedt established by Duke Julius of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel. Caselius had already been appointed to the chair of philosophy there. Next year Liddel obtained the lower mathematical chair vacated by Parcovius, and in 1594 he succeeded Erhardus Hoffmann in the higher mathematical chair. In 1596 he became M.D. of the university, and began publicly to teach physic and to act as pr√¶ses at the recitation of medical dissertations. In 1599 he was dean of the faculty of philosophy; in 1603 he resigned his mathematical professorship, and in 1604 became pro-rector of the university. Liddel returned to Scotland in 1607, financially secure. In 1612 he endowed the university of Aberdeen with lands for the education and support of six poor scholars; and in 1613 he endowed a professorship of mathematics in Marischal College. He died in Aberdeen on 17 December 1613, at age 51. His funeral sermon was given by Gilbert Gray of Marischal College. Legacy Memorial to Duncan Liddel in Pitmedden Estate, Dyce Liddel bequeathed his books and instruments to Marischal College. A brass memorial figure of him was later set up in the Kirk of St Nicholas, Aberdeen. Reputation Liddel was reputed as a mathematician in Germany, where he was said to have been the first to teach the astronomy of Copernicus and of Tycho Brahe side by side with the Ptolemaic system. Caselius considered that Liddel was the first teacher of Brahe's system; and Brahe complained of plagiarism. In theology, also, Liddel built a reputation. He found arguments against the Lutheran theologian Daniel Hofmann, who had deployed the doctrine of double truth at Helmstedt in a divisive fashion. Works Liddel wrote medical books: Title page from Ars medica (1608) by Duncan Liddel * Disputationum Medicinalium Liber, Helmstadt, 1605; medical theses maintained by himself and his pupils, 1592‚Äì1605: the volume is dedicated to John Craig.

It was a license-produced copy of the Belgian FN FAL rifle. The rifle did not enter service, as the U.S. military decided to adopt the M14 rifle instead. Origin In the wake of World War II, the NATO \\"Rifle Steering Committee\\" was formed to encourage the adoption of a standardized NATO rifle. The Committee and the US interest in the FAL proved to be a turning point in the direction of the FAL's development. The U.S. and NATO interest in small arms standardization was the primary reason why the FAL was redesigned to use the newly developed 7.62√ó51mm NATO cartridge, instead of the intermediate cartridge designs originally tested by FN. Two political factors are worth noting: the U.S. Government tacitly indicated to NATO, and specifically to the United Kingdom, that if the FAL were redesigned for the new American 7.62√ó51mm cartridge, then the FAL would become acceptable to the U.S., and they would presumably adopt it. Secondly, FN had indicated that it would allow former WWII Allied countries to produce the FAL design with no licensing or royalty costs as a gift to the World War II Allied countries for the liberation of Belgium. The U.S. tested the FAL in several forms; initially as manufactured by FN in experimental configurations, and later in the final T48 configuration as an official competitor for the new Light Self-Loading Rifle intended to replace the M1 Garand. The US Army procured T48 rifles from three firms for testing, including two U.S. based companies in an effort to assess the manufacturability of the FN design domestically. The T48 was manufactured for testing by Fabrique Nationale (FN), of Herstal, Belgium; Harrington & Richardson (H&R;) of Worcester, Massachusetts; and the High Standard Company of Hartford, Connecticut. The United States also received a small number of FAL Heavy Barrel Rifles (HBAR) (either 50.41 or pre-50.41) for testing, under the designation T48E1, though none of these rifles were adopted by US. The T48/FAL competed head to head against the T44 rifle, basically a product- improved M1 Garand with detachable magazine and select-fire capability.Stevens, R. Blake, The FAL Rifle, Collector Grade Publications, , (1993) Initial testing proved the T48 and the T44 roughly comparable in performance. In December 1953, both rifles competed in the arctic rifle trials.The T48 Automatic Rifle: The American FAL, Cruffler.com, retrieved 24 April 2012 Springfield Armory, anxious to ensure the selection of the T44, had been preparing and modifying the test T44 rifles for weeks with the aid of the Armory's Cold Chamber, including redesign of the T44 gas regulator and custom modifications to magazines and other parts to reduce friction and seizing in extreme cold. The T48 rifles received no such special preparation, and began to experience gas system problems during the trials. FN engineers opened the gas ports in an attempt to improve functioning, but this caused early/violent extraction and broken parts as a result of the increased pressures. As a result, the T44 was ranked by the arctic test staff as decidedly superior in cold weather operation. In the end, the T44 was selected over the T48/FAL primarily because of weight (the T44 was a pound lighter than the T48), simplicity (the T44 had fewer parts), the T44's self-compensating gas system, and the argument that the T44 could be manufactured on existing machinery built for the M1 rifle (a concept that later turned out to be unworkable).Rayle, Roy E., Random Shots: Episodes In The Life Of A Weapons Developer, Bennington, VT: Merriam Press, (2008), pp. 95‚Äì95Hatcher, Julian S.

It deals with cases regarding state security, but also with drug offences and other types of cases. The defendants in the court can be both military personnel as well as civilians. The Court has faced criticism for lack of independence from the executive, unfair trials, and civilians being defendants in a militarized court. History The State Security Court was derived from earlier military courts from the time when Jordan was under martial law. In September 2011 King Abdullah II of Jordan limited the possibilities of the Court to adjudicate over civilians. There would be only four types of offences over which it was to have jurisdiction: high treason, espionage, terrorism, and drug trafficking. The changes to the law were to take effect in three years. The Parliament of Jordan had voted against proposals to remove all jurisdiction over civilians in the court. Legal process The judges on the State Security Court are both civilians and military personnel. The court can adjudicate in cases against military and civilians. The jurisdiction of the court lies in both external as internal state security, drug offences and others. The State Security Court's cases are in principle open to the public, unless the court decides otherwise. The amended Press and Publication Law of March 2010 forbids journalists from being referred to the State Security Court on cases regarding freedom of expression or speech. The decisisions of the court can be appealed before the High Court. Criticism Human Rights Watch has criticized the State Security Court's lack of independence from the executive, as the Prime Minister appoints the judges on the court. It furthermore criticized the inclusion of offenses related to peaceful speech. The criticism was made after protests in Jordan in 2012 led to detainees being charged in the court. Amnesty International has criticized the State Security Court for having unfair trials. The Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor of the United States Department of State in its 2010 Human Rights Report on Jordan noted that attorneys only get to meet their clients shortly before the court case starts. The United Nations Human Rights Committee has recommended abolishing the State Security Court to Jordan.

He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. Early life James Stopford was born on 22 July 1878 in Rockhampton, the son of John Joshua Stopford and his wife Elizabeth (n√©e Wilson). His family moved to Mount Morgan when he was two yearas old. He attended Mount Morgan State School. James Stopford commenced his working life as a miner and engine driver at the Mount Morgan Mine. He was an active member of the Labor Party and the Australian Workers Union and was dismissed by the company for his union activity. He later become an organiser for the union and a member of the branch executive for the party. He married Ellen Williams in 1901.Queensland Index of Marriages 1901/C1788 Politics A member of the Australian Labour Party, James Stopford contested the newly created electorate of Mount Morgan in the 1912 election but was unsuccessful (Ministerialist James Crawford was elected). However, he was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly in the Mount Morgan in the 1915 election and held the seat until the 1932 election. During that time, he was a Minister without Office from 6 October 1922 to 2 July 1923 and then Home Secretary from 2 July 1923 to 21 May 1929. At the 1932 state election, the seat of Mount Morgan was abolished and absorbed into Fitzroy, so Stopford decided to contest Maryborough against the sitting member John Blackley of the Country and Progressive National Party. As part of a statewide swing to the Labor Party, Stopford was elected with a majority of 6,000 in Maryborough. Stopford held Maryborough in the 1935 election. While representing Maryborough, Stopford was appointed Secretary for Mines from 17 June 1932. Death Stopford was admitted to the Mater Misericordiae Hospital on 16 September 1936 with a serious condition described as \\"blood pressure\\" at the time but later as a \\"severe haemorrhage\\". He was released from hospital in early October for further recuperation at his home in Coorparoo. Although he briefly attended Parliament and a Cabinet meeting, he remained too ill to undertake his regular duties and went to Southport for further recuperation. On 30 November 1936, he suffered further haemorrhaging at Southport and was rushed by ambulance to the Mater Misericordiae Hospital in Brisbane, where he died later that day. A state funeral was held at St Stephen's Cathedral in Brisbane on 1 December 1936 after which he was buried in Toowong Cemetery. His wife and daughter predeceased him. Legacy In 1936, The Worker said that Stopford's greatest contribution was through his efforts to provide for miners who were suffering from miner's phthisis. Labor candidate William Demaine won the resulting by- election in Maryborough on 27 February 1937.

Early life and career Litton was born in Hartington, Derbyshire, but was raised in Lincolnshire, where her father Thomas Lowe was a clergyman. In 1868 she made her London stage debut at the Princess's Theatre as the title character in The Trial of Effie Deans, a play by Dion Boucicault, adapted from Sir Walter Scott's novel The Heart of Midlothian.

This includes the use of armored personnel carriers (APCs), assault rifles, submachine guns, flashbang grenades, grenade launchers,Texas Rangers, Department of Public Safety, Branch Davidian Evidence , Investigative Report No. 1, September 1999; Investigative Report No. 2, January 2000 (PDFs available at Texas Rangers website). The Rangers found that the FBI used grenade launchers to fire two 40 mm M651 grenades. The Army considers the M651 a pyrotechnic device and that it is known to cause fires.

The militarization of law enforcement is also associated with intelligence agency-style information gathering aimed at the public and political activists, and a more aggressive style of law enforcement. Criminal justice professor Peter Kraska has defined militarization of police as \\"the process whereby civilian police increasingly draw from, and pattern themselves around, the tenets of militarism and the military model.\\" Observers have noted the militarizing of the policing of protests. Since the 1970s, riot police have fired at protesters using guns with rubber bullets or plastic bullets.http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/plastic+bullet \\"A solid PVC cylinder, 10 cm long and 38 mm in diameter, fired by police or military forces to regain control in riots.\\" Tear gas, which was developed by the United States Army for riot control in 1919, is still widely used against protesters. The use of tear gas in warfare is prohibited by various international treatiese.g. the Geneva Protocol of 1925: 'Prohibited the use of \\"asphyxiating gas, or any other kind of gas, liquids, substances or similar materials\\"' that most states have signed; however, its law enforcement or military use for domestic or non-combat situations is permitted. Concerns about the militarization of police have been raised by both ends of the political spectrum in the United States, with both the libertarian Cato Institute and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) voicing criticisms of the practice. The Fraternal Order of Police has spoken out in favor of equipping law enforcement officers with military equipment, on the grounds that it increases the officers' safety and enables them to protect members of the public and other first responders (e.g., firefighters and emergency medical services personnel). However, a 2017 study showed that police forces which received military equipment were more likely to have violent encounters with the public, regardless of local crime rates. A 2018 study found that militarized police units in the United States were more frequently deployed to communities with large shares of African-Americans, even after controlling for local crime rates. Many countries also have a gendarmerie, which is a military force with law enforcement duties among the civilian population. United Kingdom/Ireland The Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) was the police force in Ireland from 1822 until 1922, when the country was under British rule. This was a time of agrarian unrest and Irish nationalist/republican agitation. The RIC was a quasi-military police force: constables were armed with rifles, billeted in barracks, and the force had a militaristic structure and uniform.Leeson, D. M. The Black and Tans: British Police and Auxiliaries in the Irish War of Independence. Oxford University Press, 2011. pp.16-17 During the Irish War of Independence, it was tasked with tackling the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and worked alongside the British Army. An Auxiliary Division and Ulster Special Constabulary were formed to carry out counter- guerrilla operations. The RIC became the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in Northern Ireland, which remained part of the UK. It remained a militarized police force due to the threat of IRA attacks. During the Northern Ireland conflict (1960s‚Äì1990s), the RUC routinely carried submachine guns and assault rifles, traveled in armored Land Rovers, were based in heavily-fortified police stationsWeitzer, Ronald.

The RUC was the first police force to use rubber and plastic bullets for riot control. The RUC was succeeded by the Police Service of Northern Ireland, which largely kept its militarized characteristics. Since the 2000s, its public order policing methods have been adopted by other police forces in the UK.Blackbourn, Jessie. Anti-Terrorism Law and Normalising Northern Ireland.

Our police services have been acquiring more and more military toys‚Äîa dangerous trend that's gotten little in the way of critical analysis in the mainstream media.\\" Growing numbers of Canadian police agencies have acquired armored vehicles in recent years. In 2010 the Ottawa Police Service bought a Lenco G3 BearCat APC for $340,000, which has \\"half-inch-thick military steel armoured bodywork, .50 caliber-rated ballistic glass, blast-resistant floors, custom-designed gun ports and... a roof turret.\\" The Lenco BearCat Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) The G20 protests in Toronto in 2010 showed that the militarization of protest policing is not only occurring in the United States.

According to Kevin Walby, an assistant professor of criminal justice at the University of Winnipeg, \\"the more interesting aspect of the militarization of the police is actually on the strategy side\\"; police are \\"increasingly training with military-style tacticians, especially when it comes to situations like crowd control and, increasingly, surveillance.\\" On June 3, 2015, it was reported that \\"RCMP officers have started openly carrying MP5 submachine guns on Parliament Hill as part of a visible increase to Parliament Hill security following last October's terrorist attack\\" in 2014. Conservative senator Vern White, a former RCMP officer and a former Ottawa police chief, says \\"...some RCMP officers guarding Parliament Hill against potential terrorist attacks should be armed with rifles similar to those carried by Canadian troops in Afghanistan [,]\\" the \\"...more powerful Colt C8 [which is] popular with police tactical teams and Canadian and other NATO alliance troops.\\" White argues that the C8 carbines would give officers a much longer shooting range than the short- barreled MP5 submachine guns. \\"The RCMP is issuing more than 2,200 C8 carbines to its officers [,]\\" but the RCMP has not indicated whether the C8s will be issued to Parliament Hill officers. The use of surplus armored vehicles for use by the RCMP and other police forces throughout the country are challenged by lawyers and academics since they can easily send the wrong message to the public. According to Michael Spratt, an Ottawa-based criminal lawyer, the funds used to acquire the vehicles is better used for crime prevention activities. Brazil In 2013 \\"... Brazil saw countrywide demonstrations protesting a lack of basic services while the country was spending billions on the World Cup and the Olympics. The unprepared and overreacting police forces responded in a way that shocked the largely middle-class protesters. The police, using \\"non-lethal\\" weapons like pepper spray and rubber bullets while dressed from head to toe in ninja-like full battle gear, indiscriminately arrested both violent \\"black bloc\\" demonstrators, known for their confrontational tactics and anarchist views, along with non-violent protestors marching peacefully.\\" As a result, \\"...calls for de-militarization of the police‚Äîfrom social movements, non-governmental organizations, and even segments of the police itself‚Äîbecame widespread and remain one of the legacies of the World Cup.\\" The Brazilian \\"...Military Police today, while not officially a wing of the Armed Forces, remains an institution with a strict military hierarchy, training that retains a military ideology, and practices that frequently resemble occupying forces conquering enemy territories.\\" The units that responded to the protests were Shock Police, units specialized in riot control. The Military Police is an ancillary and reserve force of the Army, under the General Inspectorate of Military Police, being that a part of Land Operations Command. But, in time of peace, the state governor act as commander-in-chief of the Police and Firefighting Corps, according to the Constitution of Brazil, article 144, 6th paragraph, where it is said that the \\"Military Police and Firefighter Corps, ancillary and reserve forces of the Army, subordinate themselves, with the Civil Police, to the state and Federal District governors.\\" Colombia \\"Since 1999, an eight-billion-dollar programme in Colombia has seen \\"the mass deployment of military troops and militarized police forces to both interdict illegal drugs and counter left- wing guerrilla groups\\". This assistance \\"promote[s] militarization to address organized crime\\". Due to these U.S. policies, \\"civilian forces... have increasingly received military training, leading to concerns over human rights violations and excessive use of force, as well as a lack of knowledge over how to deal with local protests‚Äîconcerns startlingly similar to those now coming out of Ferguson, Missouri.\\" Germany Survivor R in blue-silver varnish for the German NRW Police as displayed at Eurosatory 2016 In 2016, the German police introduced a \\"new special unit, BFE+\\", which is designed to \\"counter terror attacks.\\" Criminologist Rafael Behr says the new \\"mainly serves as a psychological reassurance for the public\\", serving as a \\"symbolic\\" effort and a functional effort. The functional aspect is that with the BFE+, the government can use armed forces with military weapons inside Germany, an act that is \\"currently banned by the German constitution\\". The 250 person BFE+ will be added to the existing GSG-9 unit. Behr states that the BFE+ will be able to \\"launch large-scale manhunts\\", using an \\"end of the policing spectrum\\" which \\"borders on war-like or military action.\\" Mexico Mexico's new national police force, the Gendarmer√≠a, is partially staffed with active duty soldiers, part of a longstanding trend towards militarization of the country's Federal Police. According to a 2020 study, the use of torture by police has persisted in Mexico even though Mexico transitioned to democracy. Torture is still used due to \\"weak procedural protections and the militarization of policing, which introduces strategies, equipment, and mentality that treats criminal suspects as though they were enemies in wartime.\\" Indonesia Brimob troops of the Indonesian National Police The Mobile Brigade Corps (Brimob) is an Indonesian militarized police force (Paramilitary) which are often deployed for Riot control, SWAT operations, anti-terror, domestic guerrilla warfare, domestic civil hostage rescue, search and rescue, and armed conflict management especially in areas with domestic conflict, such as in Papua and Poso. It usually conducts joint operations with the TNI. United States Professional police departments changed over time in the United States. The first professionalized police departments in the United States were modeled on the London Metropolitan Police. They were under civilian control and were nonmilitaristic in the sense that they eschewed military uniforms, weaponry and training. According to Julian Go of Boston University, police departments in the United States became increasingly militarized in the early 20th century as they \\"borrowed tactics, techniques, and organizational templates from America's imperial-military regime that had been developed to conquer and rule foreign populations.\\"  20th Century  Thompson M1921 for United States law enforcement forces During the early 20th century, police departments in the United States adopted several military innovations such as centralized chains of command, professionalization (training and discipline), military operations and tactics (in particular, colonial counterinsurgency tactics), \\"open-order\\" units, and counterinsurgency information-gathering techniques. Many of these reforms were influenced by practices from the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War and subsequent U.S. occupation of the Philippines. An influential advocate for these police reforms was August Vollmer, who has been described as the \\"father of modern policing.\\" Vollmer devised syllabi which were used in police training courses. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), as well as police departments in cities such as Kansas City, Missouri and Kenosha, Wisconsin, began deploying automatic weapons, including the Thompson submachine gun, and armored cars in the 1920s and 1930s. An FBI officer firing a Browning Automatic Rifle in 1936 George Fletcher Chandler, a veteran of the Pancho Villa Expedition and the first Superintendent of the New York State Police, was an early advocate of law enforcement officers wearing their weapons exposed on the outside of their uniforms. Police militarization was escalated in the 1950s and 1960s, an era in which race riots and anti-war protests were common in many U.S. cities. Some believe the seeming success of officers armed with military-style weapons and deployed to curtail the 1965 Watts riots, a six-day race riot sparked by conflicts with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) that killed 34 people, gave way to the trend of arming and equipping law enforcement officers with battlefield weapons. Joy Rohde, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ford School of Public Policy, has published research indicating that \\"militarization is a mindset... a tendency to see the world through the lens of national security, a tendency to exaggerate existing threats.\\" Rohde traces \\"the origins of modern militarized policing\\" to the Cold War-era anti-communist paranoia, and the idea that domestic civil rights activists were similar to foreign enemies, as manifested in activities such as the CIA's Operation CHAOS. According to Harvard University professor Elizabeth Hinton, the 1965 Law Enforcement Assistance Act ushered in a new era where the federal government facilitated the militarization of police at the state and local level across the United States. Over the last hundred years, with the rise of acts of terrorism and the availability of high-powered weapons, special weapons and tactics teams have been implemented and are being utilized across the United States. The 1960s to the 1990s, encounters with the sophisticated weapons of narcotics trafficking groups such as the Medell√≠n Cartel and street gangs such as the Gangster Disciples, with organized, left-wing protesters at such events as the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago and the 1999 WTO Conference in Seattle, with urban riots such as the 1965 Watts riots in Los Angeles, the 1967 Detroit riot, and the 1992 Los Angeles riots led law enforcement to reconsider their standard side arms. Law enforcement agencies encountered groups such as Earth Liberation Front (ELF), and incidents such as the 1984 San Ysidro McDonald's massacre, the 1986 FBI Miami shootout between eight FBI agents and two serial bank robbers in (in which the agents were out-gunned by the robbers). Researchers David N. Falcone, Edward L. Wells, and Ralph A. Weisheit describe a historical separation of police models between small towns and larger cities, which tended to function differently with separate hierarchical systems supporting each. The militarization of both rural and urban law enforcement has been attributed to the United States' involvement in wars during the 20th century, and to increasingly frequent encounters with violent protesters and criminals with automatic weapons, explosives, and body armor, although some attribute the militarization to the more recent campaigns known as the War on Drugs and the War on Terror. Historian Charles A. Beard argues that cultural change during the Great Depression encouraged the militarization of law enforcement, whereas Harwood argues that the creation of SWAT teams and tactical units within law enforcement during the 1960s began the trend. Homeland Security armored vehicle The 1981 Military Cooperation with Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies Act allows the U.S. military to cooperate with domestic and foreign law enforcement agencies. Operations in support of law enforcement include assistance in counter-drug operations, assistance for civil disturbances, special security operations, counter- terrorism, explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), and similar activities. Constitutional and statutory restrictions and corresponding directives and regulations limit the type of support provided in this area. This allows the U.S. military to give law enforcement agencies access to its military bases and its military equipment. The legislation was promoted during the Presidency of Ronald Reagan in the context of the War on drugs, and is considered a part of a general trend towards the militarization of police. The Act is cited in the 1992 essay The Origins of the American Military Coup of 2012 as having set a precedent that the author, a United States Air Force officer, considered dangerous. The 1997 North Hollywood shootout had a profound effect on law enforcement agencies. Local patrol officers at the time were typically armed with their standard issue 9√ó19mm or .38 Special pistols, with some having a 12-gauge shotgun available in their cars. The North Hollywood bank robbers carried fully automatic AK-47-style weapons with high capacity drum magazines and ammunition capable of penetrating vehicles and police Kevlar vests. With these weapons, two bank robbers fired approximately 1,100 rounds at officers and civilians before being killed. The robbers wore body armor which successfully protected them from bullets and shotgun pellets fired by the responding patrolmen. Police noted that the service pistols carried by the first responding officers had insufficient range and relatively poor accuracy, although a SWAT team eventually arrived with sufficient firepower. The ineffectiveness of the standard police patrol pistols and shotguns in penetrating the robbers' body armor led to a trend in the United States toward arming selected police officers, not just SWAT teams, with heavier firepower such as semi-automatic 5.56√ó45mm NATO AR-15 type rifles. SWAT teams, whose close quarters battle weaponry usually consisted of submachine guns that fired pistol cartridges such as the Heckler & Koch MP5, began supplementing them with AR-15 type rifles and carbines. Seven months after the incident, the Department of Defense gave 600 surplus M16s to the LAPD, which were issued to each patrol sergeant;LAPD gets M16s.LAPD gets M16s; LAPD museum showcases department's good, bad, ugly. LAPD patrol vehicles now carry AR-15s as standard issue, with bullet-resistant Kevlar plating in their doors as well.Prengaman, 2. As a result of this incident, the LAPD authorized its officers to carry .45 ACP caliber semiautomatic pistols as duty sidearms, specifically the Smith & Wesson Models 4506 and 4566. Prior to 1997, only LAPD SWAT officers were authorized to carry .45 ACP caliber pistols, specifically the Model 1911A1 .45 ACP semiautomatic pistol. A U.S. police officer armed with a holographic sight-equipped M4 carbine rifle during a training exercise The militarization of police escalated with the 1033 Program, initiated by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, ostensibly to address organized drug trafficking.American Civil Liberties Union, Report: \\"WAR COMES HOME: THE EXCESSIVE MILITARIZATION OF AMERICAN POLICE\\", June 2014, https://www.aclu.org/report/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american- police?redirect=criminal-law-reform/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization- american-police-reportAmanda Taub, Vox, 19 August 2014, https://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/6003239/police-militarization-in-ferguson The 1033 Program was documented in action through published and televised images of excessive force and armoured vehicles broadcast during the 2014 protests in Ferguson after Michael Brown was killed by police. The National Defense Authorization Act, as part of the U.S. Government's Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services (DLA) currently coordinates the transfer of excess military equipment to law enforcement agencies. , 8,000 local law enforcement agencies participate in the militarization program that has transferred $5.1 billion in military hardware from the United States Department of Defense to local American law enforcement agencies since 1997. Data from 2006 to 2014 shows that local and state police departments obtained aircraft, helicopters, bayonets, knives, night-vision sniper scopes, tactical armored vehicles or MRAP's, rifles and weapons including grenade launchers, watercraft, and camouflage gear, among other military equipment.Arezou Resvani, National Public Radio, \\"MRAPs And Bayonets: What We Know About The Pentagon's 1033 Program\\", 02 September 2014, (link provided to raw data) https://www.npr.org/2014/09/02/342494225/mraps-and-bayonets-what-we-know- about-the-pentagons-1033-program  21st Century  While under the Fourth Amendment, law enforcement officers must receive written permission from a court of law, or otherwise qualified magistrate, to lawfully search and seize evidence while investigating criminal activity. The requirements changed after the September 11 attacks, with the 2001 Patriot Act which gave law enforcement officers permission to search a home or business without the owner's or the occupant's consent or knowledge, amongst other provisions, if terrorist activities were suspected. The Act was criticized for its violation of civil liberties and has generated a great deal of controversy since its enactment. In United States v. Antoine Jones, the court found that increased monitoring of suspects caused by the Patriot Act directly put the suspects' constitutional rights in jeopardy. For a time, the Patriot Act allowed for agents to undertake \\"sneak and peek\\" searches, a term used to describe breaking into a business or residence and entering without judicial oversight. Critics such as the ACLU strongly criticized the law for violating the Fourth Amendment. On May 18, 2015, President Barack Obama announced limits on the types of military equipment which can be transferred to police departments through the 1033 Program and limits on the implementation of military training programs. Afterward, the military was restricted from transferring some weapons, such as grenade launchers, weaponized vehicles, and bayonets to police. Obama said, \\"We've seen how militarized gear can sometimes give people a feeling like it's an occupying force as opposed to a force that's part of the community that's protecting them and serving them... So we're going to prohibit equipment made for the battlefield that is not appropriate for local police departments.\\" In response to Obama's announcement, the United States' largest police union, the Fraternal Order of Police, reacted negatively, pledging to push back against the new restrictions, and accusing the administration of politicizing officers' safety. The executive director of the FOP, James Pasco, stated that his group \\"...(would) be at (their) most aggressive in asserting the need for officer safety and officer rights in any police changes that are to be effected\\", and objected to a requirement that police departments obtain permission from city governments to acquire certain equipment, including riot batons, helmets and shields, through federal programs. Pasco stated \\"We need to only look back to Baltimore (the location of the 2015 protests following the death of Freddie Gray) to see what happens when officers are sent out ill-equipped in a disturbance situation... Because you don't like the optics (of militarization), you can't send police officers out to be hurt or killed.\\" In July 2016, the Obama Administration announced that it would revisit the 2015 ban on some types of military equipment for police forces, and begin a process of case-by-case review. On August 28, 2017 U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the lifting of restrictions on the transfer of military equipment to law enforcement agencies. Sessions said during his announcement that the Trump administration would not \\"put superficial concerns above public safety\\". ACLU spokesperson Kaya Bennett responded to Sessions and said, \\"We have an epidemic in the United States of police using excessive force, particularly against people of color, with injuries and deaths mounting,\\" and \\"It defies logic to arm the police with weapons of war‚Äîgrenade launchers, high-caliber assault weapons and more ‚Äî but that's precisely what President Trump and Attorney General Sessions have decided to do.\\"All Things Considered, National Public Radio, \\"Trump Administration Lifts Limits On Military Hardware For Police\\", 28 August 2017, https://www.npr.org/2017/08/28/546743742/trump-administration-lifts-limits-on- military-hardware-for-police Since the 1033 Program was initiated in 1990, more than 5.4 billion U.S. dollars of military equipment has been transferred by the Pentagon to local and state police.  Allegations of a \\"war on police\\"  In 2015, journalist Radley Balko wrote an opinion column in which he described statements by politicians Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Scott Walker, and Dan Patrick that a \\"war on police\\" was taking place as \\"fact-free fear mongering\\" and a \\"dangerous game.\\" The statements had been made following prominent news reports of deaths by police officers; Balko wrote \\"2015 is on pace to see 35 felonious killings of police officers. If that pace holds, this year would end with the second lowest number of murdered cops in decades [and]... not only are fewer people killing police officers, fewer people are trying to harm them.\\" Notable incidents MOVE bombing On Monday, May 13, 1985, Philadelphia police attempted to clear a building occupied by MOVE black liberation activists and execute arrest warrants. This led to an armed standoff with police, who lobbed tear gas canisters at the building. The police said that MOVE members fired at them; a gunfight with semi-automatic and automatic firearms ensued. Commissioner Sambor ordered that the compound be bombed. From a Pennsylvania State Police helicopter, Philadelphia Police Lt. Frank Powell proceeded to drop two one-pound bombs (which the police referred to as \\"entry devices\\") made of FBI-supplied water gel explosive, a dynamite substitute, targeting a fortified, bunker-like cubicle on the roof of the house. The resulting explosions ignited a fire which spread and eventually destroyed approximately 65 nearby houses. Eleven people (John Africa, five other adults, and five children aged 7 to 13) died in the resulting fire, and more than 250 people in the neighborhood were left homeless. Ramona Africa, one of the two survivors, said police fired at those trying to escape. Ruby Ridge In 1992, there was a deadly confrontation and a 12-day siege at Ruby Ridge in northern Idaho between Randy Weaver, his family and his friend Kevin Harris, and agents of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). USMS and FBI agents were armed with M16s and sniper rifles, and they used an APC. It resulted in the deaths of two Weavers (Randy's son, Sammy and his wife, Vicki) and Deputy U.S. Marshal William Francis Degan. At the subsequent federal criminal trial of Weaver and Harris, Weaver's attorney Gerry Spence made accusations of \\"criminal wrongdoing\\" against every agency involved in the incident: the FBI, USMS, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE), and the United States Attorney's Office (USAO) for Idaho. At the completion of the trial, the Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility formed a Ruby Ridge Task Force to investigate Spence's charges. The 1994 Task Force report was released in redacted form by Lexis Counsel Connect and raised questions about the conduct and policy of all the agencies. Public outcry over Ruby Ridge led to the Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Government Information holding 14 days of hearings and issuing a report calling for reforms in federal law enforcement to prevent a repeat of Ruby Ridge and to restore public confidence in federal law enforcement. Waco The Mount Carmel Center, engulfed in flames. Waco, Texas, April 19, 1993. In 1993, FBI and BATFE agents used armored vehicles and tanks and attack helicopters during the siege of the Branch Davidian community in Waco, Texas. The FBI's arms included .50 caliber (12.7 mm) rifles and M728 Combat Engineer Vehicles, which are based on an M60A1 Patton main battle tank chassis. The FBI also launched CS grenade fire from M79 grenade launchers and fired two military M651 rounds at the Branch Davidian site. 40mm munitions recovered by the Texas Ranger Division at Waco included dozens of plastic Ferret Model SGA-400 Liquid CS rounds, two metal M651 military pyrotechnic tear gas rounds, two metal NICO Pyrotechnik Sound & Flash grenades, and parachute illumination flares.Texas Rangers, Department of Public Safety, Branch Davidian Evidence , Investigative Report No. 1, September 1999; Investigative Report No. 2, January 2000 (PDFs available at Texas Rangers website). The Army considers the M651 a pyrotechnic device and that it is known to cause fires. The Army Tech Manual for the M651 warns that it can penetrate -inch plywood at 200 meters and the \\"projectile may explode upon target impact\\". Other events =2005‚Äì2009= Riot police at the 2009 G20 meeting in Pittsburgh In 2005, the Maryland State Police (MSP) began entering the names and personal information of death penalty opponents and anti-war protesters into a database used to track terrorists. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, employees of the private security firm Blackwater patrolled the city with automatic weapons. \\"When asked what authority they were operating under,\\" journalist Jeremy Scahill reported, \\"one guy said, 'We're on contract with the Department of Homeland Security.'\\" Local news station WDSU mentioned reports of police officers claiming to have summarily executed looters. On August 25, 2008, the Denver Police Department (DPD) were accused of making mass, indiscriminate arrests of almost 100 protesters at the Democratic National Convention. In 2011, the city of Denver, Colorado agreed to pay a $200,000 settlement and to improve its crowd control training and policies. =2010‚Äì2014= In February 2010, the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) raided the apartment of Rickia Russell, breaching the door and throwing in a flashbang grenade, as part of a search for drugs. At the time, Russell was eating dinner with her boyfriend and the exploding grenade gave her burns to her head and calves. No drugs were found in Russell's apartment and the Minneapolis City Council agreed to pay $1 million in damages. In January 2011, Rogelio Serrato in Greenfield, California, died of smoke inhalation after a flashbang grenade launched by the SWAT team of the Greenfield Police Department (GPD) ignited a fire in his home. In May 2011, the Pima County Sheriff's department killed Marine and Iraq war veteran Jose Guerena, when they entered his home while serving a search warrant related to a marijuana smuggling investigation. They fired 71 shots into his home, while his wife and 4-year-old child were inside, and found no drugs nor anything illegal. The departments involved paid a $3.4 million settlement. Referring to the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protests in New York City, Glen Greenwald wrote, \\"The police response was so excessive, and so clearly modeled after battlefield tactics, that there was no doubt that deterring domestic dissent is one of the primary aims of police militarization.\\" The Oakland Police Department (OPD) used excessive force while breaking up Occupy Oakland demonstrations in 2011. Several protesters successfully sued the city of Oakland, California for their injuries; Scott Olsen was severely injured after being hit in the head with a police projectile and was awarded $4.5 million. The city paid $1.17 million to a group of protesters, and $645,000 to Kayvan Sabeghi, who was clubbed by police. A police sniper with a sniper system provides overwatch at the Ferguson protest regarding the shooting of Michael Brown. On May 28, 2014, a SWAT team looking for drugs in a Cornelia, Georgia home threw a flashbang grenade into the house. The grenade landed in the playpen of a 19-month-old baby boy, and the detonation severely burned and mutilated the baby's face. In late 2014, concerns about the militarization of police arose after the shooting of Michael Brown occurred on , 2014, in Ferguson, Missouri, a suburb of . The display of military gear by area police agencies dealing with the protests received significant criticism from the media and politicians. There were concerns over insensitivity, tactics and a militarized response. In recent years, the use of military equipment and tactics for community policing and for public order policing has become more widespread. Lawmakers have begun to discuss the topic. Concerns and responses Community policing The drift toward militarization concerns police officers and police policy analysts themselves. U.S. community policing grew out of the Peelian Principles of the London Metropolitan Police which emphasizes the relationship between the police and the community they serve. Police academy education patterned after a military boot camp, military-type battle dress uniforms and black color by itself may produce aggression, as do the missions named wars on crime, on drugs, and on terrorism. In a 2013 piece in the newsletter of the DOJ's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), COPS Senior Policy Analyst Karl Bickel warned that police militarization could seriously impair community-oriented policing. Bickel wrote that accelerating militarization was likely to alienate police relationship with the community, and pointed to a variety of factors that contribute to militarization, including the growth of SWAT; the increase prevalence of dark-colored military-style battle dress uniforms for patrol officers (which research suggests has a psychological effect of increasing aggression in the wearer), and \\"warrior-like\\" stress training in policing training, which fosters an \\"us versus them\\" approach.Karl Bickel, Will the Growing Militarization of Our Police Doom Community Policing? , Community Policing Dispatch, Department of Justice's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (Vol. 6, Issue 12), December 2013. Use of force A report by The Marshall Project looking at data from the early 2010s investigated the mindset of \\"guardian\\" versus \\"warrior\\" by calculating the rate of complaints for excessive use of force against police officers who had served in the military versus police officers in general. It found higher rates for veterans in Boston (28% vs. 17%) and Miami (14% vs. 11%), but found no difference for Massachusetts State Police. A national survey in August 2016 by the Pew Research Center found police officers who had served in the military were more likely to have fired their weapon while doing police work (32% vs. 26%). A police SWAT team with automatic weapons, helmets and body armor Viewpoints The ACLU has stated that local police use these \\"wartime weapons in everyday policing, especially to fight the wasteful and failed drug war, which has unfairly targeted people of color.\\" Travis Irvine from The Huffington Post referred to how \\"local police forces now roll tank-like vehicles through our streets.\\" Dave Pruett from The Huffington Post raised concerns about \\"Military Humvees, still in camouflage and mounted with machine guns, in the hands of municipal police [and] SWAT teams of police in full riot gear, bristling with automatic weapons.\\" Former Seattle Police Chief Norm Stamper published an essay arguing that \\"the current epidemic of police brutality is a reflection of the militarization... of our urban police forces, the result of years of the 'war on drugs' and the 'war on terror'.\\" Senator Rand Paul has proposed a demilitarization of U.S. police departments, stating that \\"The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.\\" Chuck Canterbury, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police, argued that the equipment received from the federal government had been properly de-militarized, and that it was being used to protect civilians from violent crime. He further stated that the use of the equipment by law enforcement was necessary to protect civilians, since mass shootings have taken place across the United States, even in small towns. Responding to claims that law enforcement officers were being given tanks, Canterbury argued that the vehicles being used by law enforcement were not armed, and that they were being used across the United States to protect other officers. On March 23, 2015, a Department of Justice investigation into use of deadly force by the Philadelphia Police Department in the period from 2007-2013 found that the way officers are trained may be a contributing factor to excessive use of deadly force. The report found that a) many officers have the mistaken assumption that being \\"in fear of their life\\" is justification for the use of deadly force, but fear should not be a factor - it's a reasonable belief that deadly force is necessary to avoid death or serious injury; b) instruction about policies on the use of force is confusing; c) most training scenarios end in some type of use of force and officers are rarely, if ever, trained how to resolve confrontations peacefully; d) 80% of suspects shot by police were black - black suspects were also more than twice as likely to be shot due to a \\"threat perception failure\\"; and e) no consistent procedure was in place for shooting investigations, no audio or video recordings of officer interviews were being made, and officers are often interviewed months after the incidents. In a report released in June 2015, Amnesty International alleged that the United States does not comply with the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. Intelligence-gathering and surveillance In a January 2017 report Cato Institute criminal justice policy analyst Adam Bates argues that in the United States, \\"an increasingly militarized domestic police force\\" is characterized by \\"mission creep [that] has not been limited to weapons and tactics. What the War on Drugs has done for police militarization, the War on Terror is now doing for police intelligence gathering, and the privacy of millions of Americans is at risk.\\"Adam Bates, Policy Analysis No. 809, Stingray: A New Frontier in Police Surveillance , Cato Institute (January 25, 2017). The ACLU has raised concerns about military involvement in surveillance of peaceful protesters. The ACLU pointed, for example, to U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) issuance of Threat and Local Observation Notices (TALON) depicting Veterans for Peace and other anti-war groups as \\"terrorist threats.\\" The ACLU also raised concerns about military involvement in \\"fusion centers.\\" Civil liberties The federal Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 forbids the U.S. military from conducting domestic law enforcement activities, embodying \\"the traditional American principle of separating civilian and military authority.\\"Matthew Carlton Hammond, The Posse Comitatus Act: A Principle in Need of Renewal , Washington University Law Review, Vol. 75, issue 2 (January 1997). There have been exceptions made, however: in 1981, Congress enacted legislation allowing military involvement in drug interdiction at U.S. borders, and eight years later \\"designated the Department of Defense as the 'single lead agency' in drug interdiction efforts.\\" In the late 1990s, following the Oklahoma City bombing, there were proposals to further limit the act to allow military participation in law enforcement activities in chemical/biological weapon and terrorism cases.David B. Kopel & Joseph Olson, Preventing a Reign of Terror: Civil Liberties Implications of Terrorism Legislation , 21 Oklahoma City University Law Review 247 (summer/fall 1996). These anti-terrorism proposals were criticized by some commentators on the basis that they were a threat to civil liberties. Writers such as U.S. Air Force officer Charles J. Dunlap, Jr. critiqued proposals to use the military for internal security, on the basis that \\"No one should suffer the illusion that military forces could ever execute the laws with the same sensitivity to civil liberties as regular police forces.\\" Dunlap argued that \\"the central imperatives of military service\\" was \\"destroying targets and undermining enemy command and control\\"‚Äîa skill that does not necessarily carry over into intelligence-gathering and investigation. Under this view, \\"a successful policization of the armed forces may well render it incapable of defeating authentic external military threats.\\"Charles J. Dunlap, Jr., The Police-ization of the Military , Journal of Political and Military Sociology Vol. 27 (Winter 1999), pp. 217-232. The accelerating militarization of regular law enforcement during the War on Drugs and post-September 11 War on Terror, however, prompted some commentators to express alarm at the blurring of the distinction between civil and military functions, and the potential to erode constraints on governmental power in times of perceived crisis.Abigail R. Hall & Christoper J. Coyne, The Militarization of U.S. Domestic Policing , Independent Review: A Journal of Political Economy, vol. 17, no. 4 (spring 2013). A 2010 paper published in the journal Armed Forces & Society examined \\"role convergence, that is, evidence that significant segments of police operations in the United States have taken on military characteristics; and evidence indicating that many U.S. military initiatives have taken on policing characteristics.\\"Donald J. Campbell & Kathleen M. Campbell, Soldiers as Police Officers/Police Officers as Soldiers: Role Evolution and Revolution in the United States , Armed Forces & Society 36(2), pp. 347-48 (January 2010). It concluded that \\"for individual citizens and for society as a whole, at least one aspect of role convergence‚Äîthe militarization of the police‚Äîis potentially troublesome. If this convergence results in the police adopting not only military-type tactics and procedures but also military attitudes and orientations, the convergence may seriously threaten traditional civil rights and liberties.\\" A 2014 ACLU report, War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing, concluded that \\"American policing has become unnecessarily and dangerously militarized...\\" The report cites an increase in unnecessarily aggressive raids, \\"tactics designed for the battlefield\\", and equipment such as armored personnel carriers and flashbang grenades‚Äîas well as a lack of transparency and oversight. Writers such as Ilya Shapiro and Randal John Meyer have argued that militarization leads to \\"extreme constitutional violations.\\" SWAT teams and military-style raid tactics Peter Kraska, a criminal justice professor at Eastern Kentucky University, found that the prevalence of SWAT teams, among police agencies serving populations of at least 50,000 people, doubled from the mid-1980s to the late-1990s, rising to 89% of police agencies by the end of this time period. Among smaller police agencies (covering areas with between 25,000 and 50,000 people), the proportion with SWAT teams rose from 20% in the mid-198-s to 80% in the mid-2000s. Kraska says: \\"When people refer to the militarization of police, it's not in a pejorative or judgmental sense.Contemporary police agencies have moved significantly along a continuum culturally, materially, operationally, while using a Navy SEALs model. All of those are clear indications that they're moving away from a civilian model of policing.\\"Josh Sanburn, This Is Why Your Local Police Department Might Have a Tank , Time (June 24, 2014). A 2014 ACLU report, War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing, concluded that \\"American policing has become unnecessarily and dangerously militarized...\\" The report examined 818 uses of SWAT teams by more than 20 law enforcement agencies in 11 U.S. states from the period of July 2010 to October 2013.Ed Pilkington, US police departments are increasingly militarised, finds report , The Guardian (June 24, 2014). Military-style tactics used by such teams include nighttime raids, use of battering rams, use of flashbangs, overwhelming displays of force, and the wearing of helmets and masks.Paramilitary police: Cops or soldiers? America's police have become too militarised , The Economist (March 14, 2014). The use of SWAT teams became especially common for drug searches. The ACLU study found that 62% of SWAT deployments were for drug raids, and that 79% involved raids on private homes; the study found that only \\"7% fell into those categories for which the technique was originally intended, such as hostage situations or barricades.\\" In some cases, civilians, including infants, were killed or injured due to police use of force in military style raids. In other cases, residents of affected neighborhoods reported experiencing psychological trauma as a result of militaristic law-enforcement tactics.Simon Davis-Cohen, Footage of the Largest Gang Raid in NYPD History Reveals the Agency's Military-Style Tactics , The Nation (September 1, 2016). The use of force and military-style equipment during such raids prompted criticism, particularly from civil libertarians such as Radley Balko, who wrote on the topic in his book Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America's Police Forces.Rob Ferrett, Police Use of Military-Style Tactics Can Be Recipe For Trouble, Journalist Says , Wisconsin Public Radio (August 1, 2013). The Chicago Police Department (CPD) have been accused of operating a secret \\"black site\\" in Homan Square where suspects were held without being booked and registered and where they could not be found by their attorneys or families. Suspects were allegedly shackled and beaten. Federal efforts to curb militarization From 1997 to 2016, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has gone to court to challenge policing practices in more than 24 cities in order to protect the civil rights of the public. The Obama administration made a broad push police reform.Tess Owen, Donald Trump and his intended attorney general signal a dramatic shift for reforms , VICE News (December 5, 2016). In 2015, the Task Force for 21st Century Policing recommended restricting federal transfers of military surplus equipment, such as grenade launchers and armored vehicles, from the Defense Department to law enforcement agencies via the 1033 program. President Obama implemented the recommendations by in Executive Order 13688,Executive Order 13688: Federal Support for Local Law Enforcement Equipment Acquisition (January 16, 2015). in what observers saw as a bid to shift police sway from \\"away from creeping militarization and toward community policing.\\" The Trump administration signaled a dramatic policy shift, with Donald Trump pledging during the campaign to reinstate the entire 1033 program.Police expect more surplus military gear under President Trump , Associated Press (December 11, 2016). In 2017, the Trump administration announced it will reinstate the program. Types of teams and weapons SWAT teams Wichita Falls SWAT team conducts a rifle drill. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams are law enforcement units in the United States that use specialized or military equipment and tactics. First created in the 1960s for riot control or violent confrontations with criminals, the number and usage of SWAT teams increased in the 1980s and 1990s during the War on Drugs, and in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. In the United States today, SWAT teams are deployed 50,000-80,000 times every year, 80% of the time in order to serve search warrants, most often for narcotics. SWAT teams are increasingly equipped with military-type hardware and are trained to deploy against threats of terrorism, for crowd control, and in situations beyond the capabilities of ordinary law enforcement, sometimes deemed \\"high-risk.\\" Other countries have developed their own paramilitary police units (PPU)s that are also described as or compared to SWAT police forces. SWAT units are often equipped with specialized firearms including submachine guns, assault rifles, breaching shotguns, sniper rifles, riot control agents, and stun grenades. They have specialized equipment including heavy body armor, ballistic shields, entry tools, armored vehicles, advanced night vision optics, and motion detectors for covertly determining the positions of hostages or hostage takers, inside enclosed structures. The increased use of SWAT teams is a hallmark of increased police militarization. The Cato Institute's Radley Balko wrote that during the 1970s, there were about 300 SWAT raids a year and as of 2005 there were 40,000 a year. SWAT teams being used for gambling crackdowns and serving a search warrant are routine in some places, like Fairfax, VA.\\"There has been a more than 1400% increase in the amount of SWAT deployments between 1980 and 2000, according to estimates... by Eastern Kentucky University professor Peter Kraska.\\" Balko states that in 2007, \\"...a Dallas SWAT team raided a Veterans [organization's]... charity poker games. In 2010, a team of heavily armed Orange County, Florida, sheriff's deputies raided several barbershops, holding barbers and customers at gunpoint while they turned the shops inside out. Of the 37 people arrested, 34 were taken in for \\"barbering without a license.\\" The Orlando barbershop raids were subsequently challenged in court, and in 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled that it violated \\"clearly established Fourth Amendment rights\\" for the government to conduct \\"a run-of-the-mill administrative inspection as though it is a criminal raid.\\"Radley Balko, Federal appeals court: Stop using SWAT-style raids for regulatory inspections , Washington Post (September 19, 2014). The ACLU has stated that \\"...heavily armed SWAT teams are raiding people's homes in the middle of the night, often just to search for drugs\\", causing people to \\"needlessly di[e] during these raids,\\" in which neighborhoods are turned into \\"warzones\\". Snipers Law enforcement snipers, commonly called police snipers, and military snipers differ in many ways, including their areas of operation and tactics. A police sharpshooter is part of a police operation and usually takes part in relatively short missions. Police forces typically deploy such sharpshooters in hostage scenarios. This differs from a military sniper, who operates as part of a larger army, engaged in warfare. Sometimes as part of a SWAT team, police snipers are deployed alongside negotiators and an assault team trained for close quarters combat. As policemen, they are trained to shoot only as a last resort, when there is a direct threat to life; the police sharpshooter has a well-known rule: \\"Be prepared to take a life to save a life.\\" Police snipers typically operate at much shorter ranges than military snipers, generally under and sometimes even less than . Both types of snipers do make difficult shots under pressure, and often perform one-shot kills. A U.S. Secret Service sniper on the roof of the White House Police units that are unequipped for tactical operations may rely on a specialized SWAT team, which may have a dedicated sniper. Police snipers placed in vantage points, such as high buildings, can provide security for events. In one high- profile incident, Mike Plumb, a SWAT sniper in Columbus, Ohio, prevented a suicide by shooting a revolver out of the individual's hand, leaving him unharmed. \\\\- News footage of sniper shooting gun out of a persons hand The need for specialized training for police sharpshooters was made apparent in 1972 during the Munich massacre when the German police could not deploy specialized personnel or equipment during the standoff at the airport in the closing phase of the crisis, and consequently all the Israeli hostages were killed. While the German army did have snipers in 1972, the use of snipers of the German army in the scenario was impossible due to the German constitution's explicit prohibition of the use of the military in domestic matters. This lack of police trained snipers was later addressed with the founding of the specialized police counter-terrorist unit GSG 9, which subsequently became a widely copied model for a police special forces unit. In September 2015, a San Bernardino Sheriff's Department sniper shot a suspect in a fast-moving car from a helicopter. The suspect leapt from his car and died on the side of the road, but his vehicle continued forward, striking another vehicle and critically injuring three civilians. Protest policing Rank of Icelandic National Police officers in full riot gear during the 2008 Icelandic lorry driver protests Observers have noted the militarizing of the policing of protests. Riot police are police who are organized, deployed, trained or equipped to confront crowds, protests or riots. Riot police may be regular police who act in the role of riot police in particular situations or they may be separate units organized within or in parallel to regular police forces. Riot police are used in a variety of different situations and for a variety of different purposes. They may be employed to control riots as their name suggests, to disperse or control crowds, to maintain public order or discourage criminality, or to protect people or property. In some cases, riot police may function as a tool of political repression by violently breaking up protests and suppressing dissent or civil disobedience. A riot policeman sprays pepper spray at seated protesters during the WTO protests in Seattle in 1999. Riot police often use special equipment termed riot gear to help protect themselves and attack protesters or rioters. Riot gear typically includes personal armor, batons, riot shields and riot helmets. Many riot police teams also deploy specialized less-than-lethal weapons, such as pepper spray, tear gas, rifles that fire rubber bullets or plastic bullets, flashbang grenades, and Long Range Acoustic Devices (sound cannons). The police tactics used during the 2001 Quebec City protest serve as an example of the approaches used by North American riot police. During the protest, riot police fired tear gas canisters, water cannon, and rubber bullets, dispersing large groupings of protesters both violent and peaceful, including teach-ins and teams of medics providing first aid to other protesters. Other tactical interventions aimed at arresting various perceived movement leaders. Allegedly, \\"plastic bullets were being used increasingly [by riot police], and from guns with laser sights so at night people could often see that the cops were intentionally aiming for heads or groins.\\" Military weapons Some U.S. SWAT teams have adopted the AR-15 carbine. Some U.S. police departments are using the M4 carbine, which will replace the M16 as the main U.S. Army combat assault rifle. After the North Hollywood shootout in 1997, the Department of Defense gave 600 surplus M16 assault rifles to LAPD, which were issued to each patrol sergeant. Various U.S. SWAT teams are armed with the Heckler & Koch MP5, a submachine gun. U.S. law enforcement agencies such as the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police (PBP) use the Barrett M82. Police use the M82 to breach barriers, because the large-calibre .50 BMG round it fires will penetrate most commercial brick walls and concrete blocks. Between 2006 and 2014, almost 5,000 M16 rifles were distributed to local and state law enforcement agencies in Ohio under the surplus military equipment program. Effects A 2017 study found a statistically significant positive relationship between militarization of the police and fatalities from officer- involved shootings. Two studies in the American Economic Journal: Economic Policy concluded that militarization of police reduced crime. However, these studies were criticized for using inappropriate data. Studies that used better data failed to replicate the findings of those studies. A 2018 PNAS study found that \\"militarized police units are more often deployed in communities with large shares of African American residents, even after controlling for local crime rates.\\" The study also found that \\"militarized policing fails to enhance officer safety or reduce local crime.\\" In popular culture The 2015 video game Battlefield Hardline depicts a militarized police, and it depicts both police and criminals wielding military-grade equipment, including rifles, machine guns and grenade launchers. The developer's insistence on \\"fantasy\\" while meticulously recreating LA areas and loosely basing crimes in the game on real-life crimes has subsequently been criticized. The documentary Peace Officer, which is about police militarization in the U.S., won the 2015 Documentary Feature Competition Grand Jury award at the South by Southwest Film Festival. The documentary Do Not Resist by Craig Atkinson is also critical of the phenomenon of police militarization, as exemplified by law enforcement training courses taught by retired military officer Dave Grossman, who tells police officers, \\"You are men and women of violence.\\" The film won the award for \\"Best Documentary Feature\\" at the Tribeca Film Festival.

It was formed circa 2000 and disbanded in 2019 in favour of 7th Air Defence Group. All of the organisation's subordinate units were drawn from the British Army's Royal Regiment of Artillery and 90% of its HQ staff, including its commander (a colonel), were tied Royal Regiment of Artillery posts. As most of the formation's personnel and equipment were Army, as were most of its outputs, the formation came under the British Army's Force Troops Command for budgetary and coordination purposes, although there was no command relationship with this organisation. Jt GBAD commanded all the Ground Based Air Defence (surface-to-air) units in the United Kingdom's Armed Forces, with the exception of the Air Defence Troop Royal Marines who are part of No 30 Commando Royal Marines under the operational command of the Royal Navy, sitting under 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines. History The requirement for a joint approach to ground based air defence Ground based air defence was first used by the British Armed Forces during the First World War and was a capability that sat predominantly under the army's Royal Regiment of Artillery. During the war, anti-aircraft units were assigned to manoeuvre brigades and were commanded at a local level. During the Second World War, the requirement for, and sophistication of, such systems was drastically increased and there was also a requirement to cooperate closely with the new third service, the Royal Air Force (RAF). This necessitated the formation of Anti- Aircraft Command within the army, an organisation that was roughly 90% artillery and commanded by a Royal Regiment of Artillery officer; but which was placed under the operational command of RAF Fighter Command. Its first commander was General Alan Brooke (later chief of the Imperial General Staff and Winston Churchill's senior military officer throughout the Second World War). At its peak this formation consisted of three corps, commanding twelve divisions. The return to single-service command In the post-war years, the three services diverged significantly and Anti-Aircraft Command ceased to exist. Ground based air defence moved away from a centralised joint command and control structure to a single-service activity. In the army, the command was replaced by one of its subordinate formations 7 (Air Defence) Brigade) (which itself was cut in size over time). The relatively small number of RAF Ground Based Air Defence units fell under the direct control of the RAF.  Formation of Joint Ground Based Air Defence Headquarters  As part of the 1998 Strategic Defence Review, the decision was taken to cut and rationalise ground based air defence, aligning the capabilities to one service but under a joint command structure. In the same year, a team led by a Royal Navy officer (to ensure impartiality) was established to assess which service's units should endure. The decision was made to disband all the RAF Regiment Rapier squadrons (battery sized formations) along with one of the two regular Army Rapier regiments (each of which consisted of four batteries). The remaining regular Rapier regiment, a reserve Rapier regiment and two Starstreak High Velocity Missile (HVM) regiments were retained. 7 Air Defence Brigade was reorganised as Joint Ground Based Air Defence Headquarters and its RAF equivalent disbanded. The organisation was then placed under command of the RAF, but with all units being manned by the Royal Artillery. This, in theory, placed the remaining Short Range Air Defence (SHORAD) assets (16th Regiment RA & 106th Regiment RA) and the remaining Very Short Range Air Defence (VSHORAD) assets (12th Regiment RA and 47th Regiment RA) under JtGBAD HQ. However, the army's refusal to release the two Starstreak-equipped VSHORAD units, who provided intimate support to their combat brigades, resulted in JtGBAD HQ having a smaller span of command than had initially been envisaged. Re- subordination of all army ground-based air defence units Rapier FSC Ground- Based Air Defence system at Blackheath, London on 2 May 2012 during an exercise to prepare for the 2012 Olympic Games The Strategic Defence Review re-rolled 47th Regiment Royal Artillery, one of the two remaining regular Starstreak HVM regiments, to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and re- subordinated the last (12 Regiment RA) under the command of JtGBAD HQ. The review also re-rolled the reserve Rapier regiment to Starstreak HVM, and a battery to become an air defence support unit (42 (Alem Hamza) Battery RA) which was to be manned by almost 200 personnel and commanded by a Lieutenant Colonel. A new Land Environment Air Picture Provision (LEAPP) battery (49th (Inkerman) Battery RA), was also established and subordinated to 16th Regiment RA, being commanded by an RAF Squadron Leader but manned by a 50/50 split RAF to army. The position of Commander JtGBAD HQ was tied as a Royal Artillery post and Deputy Commander to the RAF. The formation now controlled all ground based air defence assets in the UK military apart from the Air Defence Troop Royal Marines, over which it only has training validation authority. The new single structure would reduce inflexibility and increase efficiency in terms of training and command and control. Operations Although Joint Ground Based Air Defence Headquarters was a non-deployable force-generating headquarters, its units served in a number of overseas operations, including Operation TELIC (Iraq) in the Counter Rocket Artillery Mortar (C-RAM) role and Operation HERRICK (Afghanistan) in the Automated Sense and Warn role (AS&W;) fulfilled by 16th Regiment RA. Since the disbandment of the RAF Regiment Rapier squadrons in 2004/5, 16th Regiment RA has also had a standing commitment to provide the Resident Rapier Battery in the Falkland Islands on an enduring basis. 12th Regiment RA and 16th Regiment RA 49 (Inkerman) Battery RA were both aligned to manoeuvre brigades in the British Army and regularly deployed with them on training and operations. JGBAD HQ also played a part in UK home security operations, notably the 2012 London Olympic Games.  Disbandment  Under the Army 2020 Refine restructuring of the British Army, the Joint Ground Based Air Defence Headquarters was disbanded on 31 March 2019. The following day, 7th Air Defence Group formed with all the British Army's ground based air defence assets under its command.

Factory-produced fabrics were affordable and available in the early 19th century, but easy-to-use dress patterns and sewing machines for the home seamstress were not sold in the United States until the 1850s. Four historic American pattern companies still exist: # Butterick # McCall's # Simplicity # Vogue William Jennings Demorest and Ellen Louise Demorest began the home sewing pattern industry in 1860 by holding fashion shows in their homes and selling the patterns. This was the beginning of the Mme. Demorests' Emporium of Fashion. They published a magazine, The Mirror of Fashion, which listed hundreds of different patterns, most available in only one size. Patterns were of unprinted paper, cut to shape, and could be purchased \\"flat\\" (folded), or, for an additional charge, \\"made up\\" (with the separate pieces tacked into position). The latter version was intended to compensate for the absence of detailed instructions. Ebenezer Butterick launched The Butterick Company in 1863 to create heavy cardboard templates for children's clothing. Butterick's innovation was offering every pattern in a series of standard, graded sizes. Members of his family cut and folded the first patterns that were sold from their home. In 1866 Butterick began manufacturing patterns for women's fashions, and later added some articles of men's clothing. They began publishing the fashion magazine The Delineator in 1873 to publicize their patterns. Their patterns started as unprinted tissue paper cut to shape, folded and held together by a pinned (later pasted-on) label with an image and, later, brief instructions. In the early 1900s they began to use an envelope to hold the pattern. In the late 1910s they introduced a separate instruction sheet, called the \\"Deltor\\" (from the first three and last three letters of Delineator). In 1948, they purchased two new presses specially designed to print markings directly onto the pattern tissue. James McCall, a Scottish tailor, established the McCall Pattern Company in 1870 in New York City. Patterns were unprinted until 1919, when they started printing information directly onto the pattern pieces. In the 1920s, selected patterns had full color illustrations on their pattern envelopes. In 1932 they started printing full color illustrations on all pattern envelopes. McCall usually printed the date of release on their envelopes (the only company which consistently did so before mid-century), which makes it easy to date their patterns. Vogue Pattern Service began in 1899, a spinoff of Vogue Magazine's weekly pattern feature. In 1909 Cond√© Nast bought Vogue. As a result, Vogue Pattern Company was formed in 1914, and in 1916 Vogue patterns were sold in department stores. In 1961 Cond√© Nast entered in a licensing agreement with the Butterick Company. Simplicity Pattern Co. Inc. started producing patterns in 1927. Their goal was to produce an easy-to-use, lower-priced pattern. They were one of the fastest growing pattern companies, opening offices in Canada, London, Australia, and several in the United States. Their patterns are sold in over 60 countries. Their unprinted patterns ended in 1946, and were all printed thereafter. DuBarry patterns were manufactured by Simplicity from 1931‚Äì1946 exclusively for F. W. Woolworth Company. Hollywood Pattern Company was started by Cond√© Nast in 1932. They were known for printing photos of Hollywood stars on some of their patterns, quickly making them very popular. They continued production through the end of World War II (1946). The New York Pattern Company started in 1932 and continued until the early 1950s. They were unique in that the pattern sleeves had drawn characters rather than photos and the paper used was non-glossy. Advance began manufacturing patterns in 1933, which was sold exclusively at J. C. Penney Company. The company continued through 1966 until it was sold to Puritan Fashions. Fitzpatterns.com began offering downloadable sewing patterns in 2004. These consist of full-size patterns to be printed at a copyshop on a large format printer and or in a tiled version that can be printed on an A4 or letter sized printer and taped together.http://www.oystermag.com/features/a-stitch-in-time.htmlCrafty Geeks Launch Sewing 2.0A stitch in time - Success Stories - Catapult - ABC Online Clothkits devised cut and sew clothing kits for home sewing that avoided the need for paper patterns.

The program aired on New York City television station WABD from 1948 to 1949. Broadcast history This series is significant as representing part of WABD's daytime experiment. While not the first with daytime programming, the station was the first to introduce a schedule which began in the morning and continued through to the end of prime-time, at a time when daytime and afternoon broadcasting was heavy on test patterns. The series was about sewing, and was hosted by Alice Burrows, who was age 62 when she started appearing on the series. She was described in a news article as \\"pretty, silvery-haired and bristling with energy\\". According to the book What Women Watched: Daytime Television in the 1950s (University of Texas Press, 2005) by Marsha Cassidy, the DuMont daytime schedule beginning in January 1949 was: *10-10:30am Johnny Olson's Rumpus Room *10:30-11am Welcome, Neighbors *11am-12noon The Stan Shaw Show *12noon-12:15pm Amanda *12:15-12:30pm Man in the Street *12:30-12:45pm Camera Headlines *12:45-1pm Fashions in Song *1-1:30pm Okay, Mother *2:30-3pm Inside Photoplay (The Wendy Barrie Show) *3-3:15pm The Needle Shop *3:15-3:30pm Vincent Lopez Speaking (The Vincent Lopez Show) Preservation status As with most DuMont series, no episodes are known to exist, as live local shows were very rarely kinescoped for many years. Additionally, 1940s daytime television series are poorly preserved as a whole, with only a few scattered kinescopes known to be held by television archives (one of which, an experimental one-off telecast of the Breakfast Club radio show, aired on WABD).

Life and career After receiving a degree in public administration from the Universidad de Guanajuato, Rocha broke into politics at a young age: from 2003 to 2006, she served on the city council of Irapuato, and in 2003, she also served as a PRI national political councilor. In 2006, she became a local deputy for the first time, serving a three-year term in the LX Legislature of the Congress of Guanajuato. Rocha was selected by the PRI as a proportional representation deputy to serve in the LXI Legislature of the Mexican Congress. Rocha served as secretary on the Science and Technology Commission and additionally sat on the Commission for the Strengthening of Federalism. She also was one of just nine PRI deputies that did not vote down a constitutional reform that would have restricted abortions. However, just two days into her term, Rocha asked to leave her seat and was replaced with Guillermo Ra√∫l Ruiz de Teresa. Rocha, along with seven other deputies, became known as the because all of their alternate deputies‚Äîwho would replace them‚Äîwere men, which represented a misuse of gender quotas whereby women would be elected and then replaced with men. The result of the \\"juanitas\\" was that in 2012, the TEPJF required that all combinations of primary and alternate officials be of the same gender, in order to maintain gender quotas. From 2010 to 2014, Rocha served as secretary general to the Guanajuato state PRI, and from 2012 to 2015, she served in the LXII Legislature of Guanajuato and presided over its Education Commission. When Rocha announced she would run to return to the Chamber of Deputies in the LXIII Legislature, she was criticized by Sixto Zetina, then the mayor of Irapuato, who told Rocha on Twitter that \\"you denigrated women because you knew that you would only be a deputy because of your gender, but you were obligated to leave your seat to a man\\". Additionally, her departure from the Guanajuato state congress, undertaken in order to conduct her campaign to return to the Palacio Legislativo de San L√°zaro, left a vacant seat, as the alternate deputy refused to take the oath of office and multiple attempts to contact her did not meet with success. Voters ultimately sent Rocha back to San L√°zaro, where she serves on the Constitutional Points, Public Education and Educational Services, Jurisdictional, and Transparency and Anticorruption Commissions.

W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida Bot. Misc. 14 The epithet, effusa is in reference to the thallus spreading widely along the surface. Distinguishing Features Niebla effusa is recognized by the thallus divided into a tangled mat of irregularly cylindrical-prismatic branches without a central connection at base‚Äìto as much as 1 meter in diameter, weighing more than 1 kg‚Äîand by the ultimate parts of the primary branches becoming hooked, dilated, and fringed from which there are many erect branchlets. Black dot-like pycnidia are usually infrequent and scattered along the branch margins and cortical ridges. A key lichen substance is salazinic acid, which may be accompanied by an unknown, possibly scabrosin derivative. Triterpenes are absent as in all species in the depsidone species group. Taxonomic History Niebla effusa was first recognized as a distinct species from a related species, Niebla josecuervoi, before it was described as a result of collecting lichen samples near Cerro Solo in northern Baja California for a biodiversity screening of lichens‚Äîin the search of new drugs by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Natural Products Branch to treat HIV. It was distinguished by its habit of growing on the ground in contrast to N. josecuervoi growing on a vertical face of a large bounder with Niebla eburnea and Vermilacinia procera. A sample of 68 grams of Niebla josecuervoi was submitted to the NCI on 8 February 1986, but not of N. effusa.Samples of lichens were collected from the Eastern and Western regions of the United States and Baja California, Mexico for anti-HIV screening during 1985. Prior to 1982, samples for antitumor screening were supplied in 1 kilogram (kg) quantity (dried) to the NCI by the USDA Agricultural Research Service. In October 1982, the funding for this cooperative agreement was terminated. World Botanical Associates (WBA) was formed by Richard Spjut in May 1983 to continue to supply samples for antitumor screening. Lichens were considered a potential novel source for new anti-HIV drugs since they had rarely been collected for the NCI antitumor screening program. Richard Spjut, the Senior Partner of WBA, proposed that the NCI reduce their 1 kg quantity to 25 grams in order to obtain a broad diversity of lichen samples. The NCI group maintains an inventory of natural product extracts with details on the collection data. Voucher specimens are deposited at the United States National Herbarium (Smithsonian Institution) and cited in Spjut's 1996 revision of the genus under N. josecuervoi, Spjut & Marin 9047A along with N. effusa, Spjut & Marin 9047B.. based on its thalli with a holdfast.

These species were recognized as Niebla pulchribarbara, which the type reportedly contained protocetraric acid, a rare chemotype for the genus not found south of Bah√≠a de San Quint√≠n. Another terricolous species, containing sekikaic acid, occurred at Bah√≠a de San Quint√≠n, described as Niebla palmeri.

Early life  Jay Datus was born in Jackson, Michigan, March 24, 1914, to Jesse Datus Smith and Marguerite Wood Smith. His birth name was Jesse Datus Smith, Jr. The family moved about living a short time in Chicago and eventually moving to Worcester, MA, the home of his mother. Datus attended Sever Street Preparatory School and Classical High School in Worcester. He graduated from Classical High and the Worcester (MA) Museum School of Fine Arts in 1931. He then attended Yale School of Fine Arts from 1931‚Äì1934, studying with Eugene Savage. He briefly studied portraiture with Wyman Adams in New York and London. It is during this time that presumably Jesse, Jr. changed his name to Jay Datus for professional reasons (the 1930 census records list him as J. Datus so Jay Datus might have been a natural progression). Datus moved back to Chicago in the mid 1930s where he opened his first studio. He did murals for private homes and some portraits. He even participated in two exhibits at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1936 and 1937. He married Martha (Marty) Berry in 1936. She too was an artist, but specialized in landscapes.\\"Former City Resident Paints Eight Murals for Arizona.\\"  The Mural at the Arizona State Library  At the age of 23, Datus won the honor to paint the murals in the Arizona State Library for a WPA projectJay Datus, Biographical Materials, Arizona Memory Project. Datus and his wife traveled to Arizona from Illinois where they remained for most of the two years it took to complete the project. Before beginning the actual painting, Datus spent extensive time studying the various subjects. For example, working closely with Mulford Winsor, the Arizona State Librarian at the time who had done some research on the topic, Datus carefully included Apache smoke signals in the smaller panels, but only after further consultation with other Apaches. He was extremely concerned that his paintings were accurate in every detail although he did take some liberties in combining some groups. Datus presented his research notes and descriptions of each panel to the State Library when he was done. These were to be the basis for a brochure about the mural, but they were never published. The September 1944 issue of Arizona Highways featured these murals.Arizona Highways Magazine, Arizona Pageant of Progress, Guy L. Jackson, Arizona Memory Project\\"He Lost His Heart to Arizona\\" Following the completion of the murals, Datus and Marty returned to Illinois. However, Marty died after a short illness October 15, 1940. He did have a one-man show at the O‚ÄôBrien Galleries in Chicago for one week, November 26 ‚Äì December 7, 1940, which included ten portraits and four cartoons for the Pageant of Arizona Progress mural. By mid January 1941, Datus finished work on some sketches for a proposed mural for the Illinois Bell Building in Chicago and asked Mulford Winsor for a letter of recommendation. Datus did not win that completion.  World War II - 1947  In March 1941, Datus joined the Cook County, IL National Guard (he had told Mulford Winsor that he had a rather low draft number and felt that he would be called up soon). Starting off as a private in the Army Field Artillery, by November, he was a corporal stationed at Camp Forrest, Tennessee. Again he asked Mulford Winsor for a recommendation for admission to Officers‚Äô Training School (it had become a standing joke between the two that that was the primary reason Datus would write after leaving Arizona). Datus was successful and started OCS at Fort Sill, Oklahoma in February 1942, graduating in May 1942 as part of the 12th OCS class of that year. He was subsequently commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant. It is unclear when he shipped out and with what unit. While serving in the South Pacific though, Datus briefly managed to draw portraits on scraps of paper or tent canvas. When WWII ended, Datus returned to Chicago where he eventually married Edette Kable June 14, 1946, an employee in the paint store Datus frequented. During this time, Datus did do some commercial work, a set of twelve pictures, which were used on gas station and grocery store calendars for at least two years. Datus also adopted Edette‚Äôs young daughter, Cynthia.  Later years 1948 ‚Äì 1974  Datus apparently had never forgotten the beauty of Arizona. Thus, in 1948, he, his wife, and daughter returned to Arizona and settled permanently in Phoenix. On what is now the northeast corner of 30th Street and Clarendon, Datus established the Kachina School of Art and his home. However, teaching was not Datus' only contribution to the art world of Phoenix and Arizona. He served on the Heard Museum Board of Directors from 1957‚Äì1959, was director of the Fine Arts displays at the Arizona State Fair, and worked diligently to develop the now Phoenix Art Museum being a board member of the Phoenix Fine Arts Association. In the 1950s and early 1960s, Datus painted portraits of many of the prominent people living in Phoenix. The State of Arizona commissioned him to do the portraits of the 1963 Speaker of the Arizona House: Wilber B. \\"Bill\\" Barkley, and the 1955-56 President of the Arizona Senate: Clarence Carpenter. He also painted other works, many of which were displayed in art shows throughout the valley. But these portraits and other small works merely provided the money to fund his true love: murals. These murals predominately graced the walls of banks such as First National, First Federal Savings, Western Savings, and other commercial buildings in Arizona. His largest mural, Foundations of Confidence, was installed in the lobby of the First National Bank main branch (411 N. Central Ave, Phoenix, AZ). At the time, 1956, it was purported to be the largest mural in the southwest. Apparently a gentleman from the Midland (TX) Savings and Loan Association saw this mural and commissioned Datus to do one for their new building. That mural, Cowboys to Skyscrapers, was installed in mid 1959. However, its existence is not known. While the First National Bank building still exists, the mural was removed a number of years ago when the previous owner, Arizona Public Service, sold the building. That mural currently rests in the vault of the Arizona Museum of Natural History awaiting restoration as does the Kiva at Awatovi which formerly hung in the First Federal Savings building on 20th St. and Camelback. The Route of the Aviatrix which once hung in First National Bank's fly-in branch at Sky Harbor Airport now rests in a Wells Fargo Bank vault.  Kachina School of Art  The Kachina School of Art offered day and evening programs for adults and children for over 25 years. Courses and programs covered a wide range of medium and were taught by both Datus and other renowned local artists such as Paul Coze and Lotan Lotan. Over the years, the students of Jay Datus contributed to the art world of Phoenix and the country for he wrote almost a weekly art column (\\"The Paint Box\\") in the Arizona Republic for five years. He instituted correspondence art courses in 1965/65. The intent was to provide the ‚Äúsame individual art instruction program that is taught in [the] resident school.‚Äù\\"This Week Magazine.\\" The books for these courses, Master Artists Training Course, took ten years to complete. For a number of years, the Kachina School of Art held an annual ball, The Beaux Arts Ball which became one of the premier social events of spring in Phoenix. In July 1952, Datus addressed the Phoenix City Council and proposed that the funds raised at this event would be used to purchase art from the Arizona State Fair entries which would then be donated to the City of Phoenix Art Collection. These became known as the Kachina Civic Art Collection and hung in the Phoenix Civic Community Center (this pre-dates the Phoenix Art Museum). Today, this collection is part of the Phoenix Municipal Art Collection and owned by the City of Phoenix. Datus had a summer studio near Heber, AZ, called the Buckskin Acres and Art Community which also offered courses. Datus died in October 1974. His wife and daughter continued to run the correspondence art courses for several more years.

Farmington was settled in the 1770s, and experienced its most rapid growth after being named the shire town (county seat) of Franklin County in 1838, with a secondary spurt of redevelopment after a major fire in the 1880s. Its central business district encompasses many of the town's historic resources, and its most significant commercial and civic architecture. The district, which includes more than 130 resource over , was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Description and history The Farmington Historic District is primarily laid out along a stretch of Main Street, extending roughly between Belcher Road in the north and the junction of Main and Prescott Streets in the south. It also includes High Street between Middle and Anson Streets, and extends eastward along Broadway, Court and Orchards Streets. This area includes substantially all of the historic elements of the town's central business district, while excluding most of the campus of the University of Maine at Farmington, which lies just to the south on High and Main. The center of the central business district is at the junction of Main Street and Broadway. Blocks to the north, south, and east are lined with brick commercial buildings. The Franklin County Courthouse lies one block north of this intersection, between Church and Anson Streets, and is one of several buildings designed by noted Maine architect George Coombs. The areas north and east of these blocks give way to more residential structures, with a few churches on High Street and near the southern end of the district on Main Street. Notable civic buildings in the district, besides the county courts, include town hall and the Cutler Memorial Library, a Beaux Arts structure built in early 20th century. Greenacre, which stands high above Court Street, is probably the town's finest Italianate mansion. \\"Fewacres\\", the home of noted juvenile fiction writer Jacob Abbott, was originally part of the district, but was demolished c. 2010. Churches of interest include the First Congregational Church, United Church of Christ, and the former Free Will Baptist Church, which is now a garage at 219 Main Street.

History The origins of the railway in Ebbw Vale can be traced to the Beaufort Ironworks Tramway which opened in 1798 between the ironworks as far as Crumlin. The tramway was converted from to gauge in 1806. On 23 December 1850, the Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company introduced a regular passenger service between and . Services were extended to Ebbw Vale on 19 April 1852 after improvement works had been carried out to the section between and Ebbw Vale. The initial passenger service consisted of three trains either way at 7.00am, 12.00pm and 4.45pm from Newport, and at 9.00am, 2.15pm and 6.45pm in the other direction. The tramway was relaid as a standard gauge line in 1855. A single platform station was provided with a brick station building facing the road. Situated in a slight cutting, it was conveniently located to the town centre. It was also convenient for the Ebbw Vale Steelworks at Pont-y-Gof which were connected to the line by the Rassa Railroad. This connection was in use until 2 November 1959. Adjacent to the station building was a 46-lever signal box. The line continued north to a remotely situated goods yard and an untimetabled stop for miners at Beaufort. To the south, a road overbridge crossed the line. The single platform was subsequently doubled in size and the platform buildings rebuilt. The station boasted a staff of 44 in 1923 and 62 in 1937\\\\. A second station was opened in Ebbw Vale by the London and North Western Railway on 2 September 1867. To distinguish the two Ebbw Vale stations, British Railways added the suffix \\"High Level\\" (the L&NWR; station) on 23 May 1949 and \\"Low Level\\" (the GWR station) on 19 July 1950. The rundown of the line began in 1939 when the Beaufort Ironworks line fell out of use. Next came dieselisation in 1958 and then closure to passengers on 30 April 1962. The line was then singled in 1964 and the signal box was taken out of use on 17 August in the same year. Closure to goods traffic came on 1 December 1969. Present The station site was cleared after closure and only the station house and a short section of the retaining wall which supported the cutting side remains. A road occupies part of the trackbed.

The fourth edition of the Liberty Bowl, it featured the Oregon State Beavers and the Villanova Wildcats, both independent programs. Background Both teams were independents. The Beavers were led by Heisman Trophy winner Terry Baker in their first bowl game in five years as the Beavers had won seven straight games before this one, with highlight being a 27‚Äì0 win over No. 12 Stanford, a 51‚Äì22 rout of No. 19 West Virginia, and a 20‚Äì17 win after trailing 17‚Äì6 at halftime over Oregon. The Wildcats were in their second straight bowl game. Game summary Bad weather made the field frozen, and the weather never reached above 25 degrees, making efforts at getting toward the end zone nearly futile. Although Oregon State was the clear favorite, the Wildcats kept the game close. The game's only score came on a 99-yard run by Baker with under 10 minutes left in the first quarter. Trapped at their one after a punt, Baker was almost sacked by Al Atkinson for a safety. But he broke free, running by the sideline and sprinting toward the end zone. Despite two chances at a chance for two more points, their conversion attempt fell short, leaving it at 6‚Äì0. Villanova had a Billy Joe touchdown called back due to a penalty and had another chance intercepted by the Beaver defense. Baker went 9 of 21 passes for 123 yards and accounted for 250 of the team's 299 yards. This was the first bowl win for the Beavers since 1942 and the last bowl win for the Beavers until the 2001 Fiesta Bowl.http://www.gazettetimes.com/sports/community/column-a-look-back-at- oregon-state-s-liberty-bowl/article_9ee17ece-e1e5-11e1-8ec9-001a4bcf887a.html References Liberty Category:Liberty Bowl Category:Oregon State Beavers football bowl games Category:Villanova Wildcats football bowl games Category:1962 in sports in Pennsylvania Category:December 1962 sports events ","title":"1962 Liberty Bowl"},{"id":"44802190","text":"Martine Pascal (born 1939) is a French theatre, cinema, and television actress.

Philosophical work Influenced by ≈Ωi≈æek and his readings of German idealism, Johnston‚Äôs work has gained many readers among those making the materialist and realist turns in Continental philosophy. Johnston‚Äôs books are guided by his ‚Äútranscendental materialism,‚Äù which in sum calls for a materialist ontology that nevertheless does not reduce away the gap or figure that is human subjectivity. Johnston argues for retooling Freud and Lacan after the success of the natural sciences in recent decades, but argues that both Freud and Lacan presaged a lot of these successes. Critical of the thinkers of immanence whom he believes, following Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, can only give us subjectless substance, Johnston‚Äôs work has brought Lacanianism into the 21st century when many wrongly claimed it died long before the end of the last.

She married secretly and had twins abroad at the age of fifty who would inherit the family's riches. This birth was thought incredible and the ensuing long and expensive court case was fought in three countries and it was settled in her favour by the House of Lords in 1769, over 15 years after her death. Life Lady Jane Douglas was the daughter of James Douglas, 2nd Marquess of Douglas and the only sibling of Archibald Douglas, third marquess and first duke of Douglas. Her maternal grandfather was Robert Kerr, first marquess of Lothian. When she was 22 the Duchess of Queensberry thwarted the plan for her to marry Francis Scott, 2nd Duke of Buccleuch, by marrying him, coincidentally, to another Lady Jane Douglas who was the daughter of James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry and the duchess's sister-in-law. Despite several earls and dukes wanting to be suitors this Jane Douglas refused their proposals. She was able to live due to the support of her brother, and possibly to spite him, she started a romance with the penniless Colonel John Stewart of Grantully, but broke off the courtship having previously said that she had an 'aversion' to the married state. After a decade she wrote to him, saying she would admit their friendship publicly if he wanted to visit her again and she and the Colonel were married in 1746 at Drumsheugh without the knowledge of her brother. Douglas Cause In the middle of 1748 she admitted the marriage and gave out the news that she was heavily pregnant. She gave birth in Paris where the couple had moved to escape their creditors. But there is some doubt as to whether her baby or babies died and were replaced by her husband, with or without her knowledge, after he sought French mothers who were willing to sell or give away their babies. One of these children would inherit the family's riches. The suspicion that the children she took back to Scotland were not 'born of her body' led the Hamilton family, who were the next heirs, to appoint lawyers to investigate the circumstances of the Paris events at the time of the alleged birth or births. Douglas and one of her twin children died in Edinburgh in 1753.Rosalind K. Marshall, ‚ÄòDouglas, Lady Jane (1698‚Äì1753)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 21 December 2014 The ensuing long and expensive court case over the family's inheritance with Duke of Hamilton became known as the Douglas Cause.

Swayed by the speech of the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mansfield, who it turned out had known Lady Jane and lent her money, the lords overturned the previous judgement made two years before in Scotland and awarded the Douglas estates to Archibald Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas. The inheritance included Douglas Castle, which later descended to Alec Douglas-Home, British Prime Minister.

Construction The launch Paluma was built by Taylor's Slipway at Townsville, Australia, in 1941. Service history Paluma was requisitioned for wartime use on 11 September 1941 and purchased on 1 June 1942. The launch was being used as the examination and patrol vessel at Thursday Island when offered to meet a requirement for seaworthy small ships to insert Coastwatchers and gather intelligence for a proposed Allied offensive against Rabaul. The Japanese move from Rabaul on New Guinea forestalled any Allied attack on Rabaul and shifted focus to a counter offensive in New Guinea. Inshore sea route area of operations. The prewar sea route to the north coast of New Guinea, particularly the Buna area of planned operations, had been closed by the Japanese advance and naval control of open waters leaving only an inshore route described by MacArthur's Chief of Transportation, as \\"the most dangerous coastline in the world\\" and essentially uncharted. In October 1942, all the vessels of the US Army Small Ships Section, largely crewed by Australians, had been ordered to Milne Bay to support the operations against Japanese in the Buna area. Those small vessels, in their night runs to Oro Bay, had begun noting channels and marking reefs with oil drums. The small ships could not support the beachhead, being largely supported by air, with heavy equipment and supplies so that a way for large ships had to be found. Paluma, under the command of Lieutenant Ivan Champion RANVR, was assigned to survey a reliable, large vessel, route from Milne Bay to Oro Bay]. In addition to surveys, the vessel was to install lights, land shore parties under Captain J . K. McCarthy for reconnaissance, establish radio stations and pilot ships through discovered channels. By early November Paluma had found a route around Cape Nelson when the hydrographic section in the RAN learned of the local effort and lent assistance with surveys by , and assisting, establishing safe passage for large ships from Milne Bay to Cape Nelson while Paluma worked the route forward to Oro Bay so that by 11 December 1942 the US Army controlled Dutch vessel was able to deliver tanks to the front. Immediately after Karsik's passage the regular convoys code named Operation Lilliput began operations. Paluma was awarded the battle honour \\"New Guinea 1942‚Äì43\\". Fate After service she was returned to her owners in Townsville. It was used for scheduled trips to Palm Island, and irregular charters. It sat idle in Ross Creek during the 1980s, next to the Flinders Street ferry terminal. The vessel was refitted in 1990 to be used for charters, although it did not pass survey. Paluma burnt to the waterline near Airlie Beach in the 1990s.

History Former coat of arms of Krasnohvardiiskyi District It was known as the 5th court district of Yekaterinoslav (Dnipro's former name) when it was first created on 1 December 1897. After the 1905 revolution, the district was renamed into the Zavodskyi District and in 1917 the Brianskyi District after the same Briansk Factory (today, Petrovsky Metallurgical Factory). From 1920 to 1923 the district was named the Fabrychno-Chechelivskyi District. In 1923 its name was changed again, this time to the Chechelivskyi District. In 1925 it became known as the Krasnohvardiiskyi District. In 1963 the eastern portions of the district were annexed to the newly formed Zhovtnevyi District. In 1973 some additional territories of the Zhovtnevyi and Krasnohvardiiskyi districts were also annexed to the newly formed Babushkinskyi District.

However, the timing of Christmas occurring during the Southern Hemisphere's summer season has resulted in the development of some local traditions as a result of the warmer weather. New Zealand Christmas dishes include summer fruits and vegetables, and pavlova (a meringue-based dessert popular in Australasia). The New Zealand Christmas tree, the p≈çhutukawa, is displayed as well as the traditional Northern European tree. Christmas (), observed on 25 December, became widely celebrated in the late 19th century among PƒÅkehƒÅ (European) settlers. Today, Christmas Day and Boxing Day are both statutory holidays in New Zealand. While Boxing Day is a standard statutory holiday, Christmas Day is one of the few days of the year where all but the most essential businesses and services must close. History The religious festival of Christmas was introduced to New Zealand by Christian missionaries in the early 19th century. In the mid 19th century observance of the holiday varied along sectarian grounds. English and Irish settlers, who were typically Anglicans and Catholics respectively, brought their own Christmas traditions. Scottish settlers did not widely celebrate Christmas as the Scottish Presbyterian church never placed much emphasis on the Christmas festival, on the grounds that it was unscriptural. In the late 19th century the Presbyterians began to embrace Christmas celebrations, and as sectarianism between the different ethnic communities decreased the holiday became widely observed by all New Zealanders‚Äîalbeit as a low-key, private affair until the late 20th century. Christmas Day became a bank holiday following the Bank Holidays Act 1873, and all workers were entitled to a day off for Christmas as a result of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1894. The Public Holidays Act 1910 further established Christmas Day and \\"the day after Christmas Day\\" (Boxing Day) as non-working days. Imagery and decorations The December-flowering p≈çhutukawa (Metrosideros excelsa) is an often-used Christmas symbol in New Zealand. New Zealanders celebrate Christmas with mainly traditional Northern Hemisphere winter imagery, but mixed with local imagery. Native plants, ferns, and flaxes are displayed alongside traditional Christmas flowers such as mistletoe. The p≈çhutukawa (Metrosideros excelsa), which produces large crimson flowers in December, is an often used symbol for Christmas in New Zealand, and subsequently the pohutukawa has become known as the New Zealand Christmas tree. Many homeowners decorate the exterior of their houses. Displays range from the modest to elaborate, sometimes with hundreds of lights and decorations depicting seasonal motifs such as Christmas trees, Santa Claus, reindeer, or nativity scenes. Particular regions have a tradition for elaborate displays, and attract a great amount of pedestrian and vehicular traffic during the Christmas season. This is despite the longer days, resulting in dusk occurring as late as 10:20 p.m. in the south of the South Island. Food Pavlova is a popular Christmas dessert in New Zealand Families traditionally gather for a Christmas Day lunch. Traditional foods include roast beef, turkey, lamb, salads and roast vegetables. More recently, as appropriate to the often hotter weather of the day, it has become popular to serve local seasonal produce such as cold meats and seafood (such as eel). Increasingly common, instead of a formal dinner indoors, New Zealanders relax outdoors on Christmas Day and enjoy a barbecue lunch on the beach‚Äîpopularised since the 2000s. Similarly, dessert also includes a mix of traditional winter Christmas food (such as plum pudding, fruit mince pies, and Christmas cake) alongside local traditions, such as pavlova topped with summer fruits or kiwifruit. Parades Christmas display, featuring Santa Claus and reindeer, on a shop on Queen street, Auckland, 2013 Several Christmas themed parades are held in New Zealand. A popular event is Auckland's Santa Parade down Queen Street. This features numerous floats and marching bands and attracts large crowds every year. It is held late November to accommodate holidaymakers and is seen as the preamble to the later festivities. The Australian tradition of Carols by Candlelight is popular in New Zealand, especially in Auckland and Christchurch, where there is usually a large outdoor carol-singing gathering known as Christmas in the Park. Retail The lead-up to Christmas is the busiest shopping season in New Zealand. Paymark, who provides EFTPOS services to 70 percent of retailers, recorded a total spend of $8.6 billion of transactions through its network in the six weeks leading up to Christmas 2019. On Christmas Eve 2019, the Paymark network processed 199 transactions per second at peak times. Black Friday sales began to be adopted by New Zealand retailers in 2013, largely to remain competitive with US-based online retailers. In 2015, major retailers such as The Warehouse, Noel Leeming and Harvey Norman offered Black Friday sales, and by 2018 were joined by Farmers, JB Hi-Fi, Briscoes and Rebel Sport. Paymark processed $253 million in transactions though its network on Black Friday 2019, overtaking Boxing Day for the first time. Media As Christmas falls in summer, the watching of television is not a strong part of New Zealand Christmas traditions, unlike in the United Kingdom, in which it is one of the most important days for television ratings. Television ratings in New Zealand are not taken during the summer and schedules are mostly filled with repeats of old programs or previously cancelled shows. Some locally produced programs have a Christmas special, though often it will be shown early December and not on Christmas Day itself. Many television stations rerun Christmas-themed films in the weeks leading up to and including Christmas Day, such as Miracle on 34th Street, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, The Polar Express, Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas and various film versions of A Christmas Carol. No advertising is allowed on New Zealand television or radio on Christmas Day, a rule that also applies on Good Friday and Easter Sunday (as of 2014).

It stands on a long rectangular island site between the east side of Bloomsbury Square and Southampton Row. It became a Grade II listed building in December 1990. History and description The building was designed by Charles William Long and constructed in the 1920s, in a style described by Pevsner as \\"Neo-Grec\\". It was built for and occupied for many decades as the head office of the Liverpool and Victoria Friendly Society. The east side of Bloomsbury Square was formerly a terrace of houses, which included the London house of the 18th century judge Lord Mansfield, which was looted in the Gordon Riots. The building was constructed between 1926 and 1932. The building was constructed with a steel frame and Portland stone fa√ßades. It has eight main storeys, plus basement and sub-basement, with 15 bays along the east and west elevations, and five bays on the north and south sides. The rusticated ground floor level has retail units on Southampton Row. Giant order pilaster, separated by window openings, span the second to fourth floors, with porticos in the centre of each long side. The tympanum of each triangular pediment includes figurative sculptures by Herbert William Palliser, with the group to the west representing the bounty of the natural world and the group to the east representing navigation and industry. Two further storeys in the frieze and parapet levels, and two in the green slate mansard roof with dormer windows, topped by a small central two-storey feature above the mansard. Inside, each side retains its original entrance lobby faced with Subiaco marble, and ornamental brasswork by the Bromsgrove Guild, some with the \\"VH\\" monogram. A large central space on the ground floor opens to three floors, with a coffered ceiling. Although the exterior of the building is largely unchanged, the interior has been extensively modernised, with work completed in 2003. Interior features of historic interest were retained and refurbished to their former condition, including the original Art Deco ballroom which was transformed into the Bloomsbury Ballroom function venue, while other areas were substantially remodelled to create large amounts of office and leisure space. A retail area with open arcade was added to the Southampton Row frontage, recreating its former appearance prior to redevelopment in the 1950s. The Bloomsbury Ballroom featured in the final episode of The Apprentice (UK series ten) where it was used as the location for the two finalists' business launches.

Early crimes and escapes  1882‚Äì1890s  Cashel was born in Nebraska in 1882. When he was 14 he left home and quickly ran afoul of the law. He was arrested and sent to jail twice; both times he escaped. Now a fugitive in the United States, he crossed from Wyoming, through Montana into Alberta, Canada, and worked as a ranch hand at several locations. On October 14, 1902, he was arrested and charged with forgery for passing a bad check. While being transported by train under guard, Cashel escaped out the window of the train's lavatory. A posse was formed by the North-West Mounted Police, but Cashel eluded them. Several weeks later, on November 19, a man called on police to report his brother-in-law, Isaac Rufus Belt, had gone missing from his ranch east of Lacombe. Upon investigation by the authorities, it was discovered that a young man named Bert Elesworth had been staying at Belt's ranch at the time of the latter's disappearance. From descriptions given of Elesworth, police determined that he was Cashel living under an alias, and began to hunt for him. He was discovered at a camp on the outskirts of Calgary, wearing Belt's clothing, and had in his possession several of Belt's possessions, including a $50 American gold certificate. Cashel was arrested for horse theft, as no body had been found that would allow a charge of murder. He was sentenced to 3 years in prison for the thefts. On July 20, 1903, a farmer discovered Belt's decomposing body in a river. Examination showed that he had died from a gunshot to the chest, with the bullet found being the same type and caliber as the rifle Cashel carried. Cashel was brought from Stony Mountain Penitentiary back to Calgary to face murder charges in the death of Belt. The trial began on October 19 and lasted until October 27, at which time Cashel was found guilty and sentenced to hang, the execution date being set for December 15. Because of his history of escaping, he was held in a specially-built cell, which kept him separate from the other inmates, and was itself set in one corner of a large room where it could be seen by everyone within. The gallows where Cashel was to hang was visible outside the window. Escape from the Mounties A newspaper reporting his escape. Cashel's brother John visited nearly every day, and on December 10 he arrived as usual. Under the pretense of a tearful final farewell to his brother ‚Äì indeed both men were openly weeping ‚Äì John covertly handed two revolvers to Ernest who concealed them as John left the room. As the guard was being changed from the day shift to the night, Cashel pulled both revolvers and ordered the 3 guards in the room to first disarm themselves, and then to open his cell. He chained the guards up in his cell and left the building. Cashel near a house, circa 1903 John Cashel had left his brother a horse to escape upon, but the animal was spooked by Ernest's rapid approach and broke free, disappearing into the frozen night. Realizing that the cold required him to find shelter quickly, Cashel visited a female acquaintance in Calgary, and demanded she hide him for the night. The pursuing Mounties also realized that Cashel would have to find shelter quickly, and began to search known underworld hangouts. The next day, the horse that had been readied for Cashel's escape was found. John Cashel confessed to his role in the escape of his brother. He would later be sentenced to two years' imprisonment, while the three guards involved were fired for dereliction of duty. One Mountie called Cashel's escape \\"the greatest blow the Mounties had received in all their experience.\\" Manhunt and capture A wanted poster for Cashel A massive manhunt followed the escape. Reports of sightings of Cashel flowed in from all over Alberta. These would mostly turn out to be false leads, although Cashel was actually seen in Calgary around Christmas. Eventually, the need for food and shelter had Cashel breaking into homes and forcing the occupants to give him food and clothing. These reports helped the Mounties track his movements. It was later learned that Cashel had been keeping track of his own pursuit by following the papers, and indeed had never been more than from Calgary during his run. The police received a tip on January 24, 1904, that Cashel was hiding in the cellar of a farmhouse outside of Calgary. A large force was dispatched to apprehend him. Along the way, they searched every structure they came upon, before discovering a haystack in the vicinity of the farmhouse that had been hollowed out with a small living space within. Convinced they were close, a portion of the squad began to search the farmhouse. One officer started to descend to the cellar when a gunshot rang out from below. As the officer backed from the cellar, Cashel pursued and a brief exchange of gunfire was had, during which neither man was hit. Finally Cashel was hit in the foot and retreated back into the farmhouse's cellar. The main body of the police, alerted to Cashel's presence, quickly surrounded the farmhouse. The inspector in charge decided to burn the house to force Cashel out. As the fire was lit, Cashel called out that he was going to kill himself, and indeed a single gunshot was heard moments later. The police proceeded with the fire regardless, and soon Cashel called out again that he would surrender if he was promised not to be shot. This much was agreed to, and Cashel threw his guns out and surrendered to the Mounties. Execution The report of his execution from The Globe and Mail. Cashel was taken into custody and transported back to the same cell that he had escaped from, some 45 days prior. Along the way, he told police that he was completely aware at all times of their actions, and could have escaped back to the United States at any time, but stayed near Calgary in the hopes of rescuing his brother. He was immediately taken before the court, and a new execution date was set for nine days later. Ernest Cashel was hanged on February 2, 1904 at the North-West Mounted Police barracks in Calgary. He was buried in an unmarked grave, in the potter's field section of Calgary's Union Cemetery.

Biography Choi Jung Hwa studied taekwondo since the age of 7 under his father and many prominent high ranking taekwondo Masters during their visits and stays with General Choi. His claimed earliest recollections of training are around the time General Choi was appointed as Korea's Ambassador to Malaysia. Choi spent his early childhood training on the lawn of the Embassy compound, as there were no dojangs established at that point. He grew up in an environment surrounded by taekwondo due to General Choi's schedule and work in spreading taekwondo globally. Choi Jung Hwa trained with many high-ranking instructors during this period. International Taekwon-Do Federation Choi held the post of Secretary General and Vice Secretary of the ITF for several years until elected as Choi Hong Hi's successor to the Presidency by the ITF members in 2001. He allegedly offered that General Choi should remain ITF President for the first 2 years of that term as to give him the opportunity to \\"retire with dignity\\" in 2003. General Choi Hong Hi died less than 12 months later. Choi Jung Hwa was promoted to 9th Degree Black Belt in 2004 and to the rank of Grandmaster. Choi prefers the title of President or Master to Grandmaster. He has been a regular visitor to Australia since the mid-1990s. After his father's death he formed his own International Taekwondo Federation. Prior to forming his own Taekwondo organization he was a Vice Secretary of his father's ITF organization. Choi Jung Hwa still works extensively promoting Taekwon-Do around the world and is accredited with introducing and developing Taekwon-Do in many Eastern European countries such as Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Romania, the former USSR and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Under his leadership, the ITF historically returned to South Korea for its 2004 ITF World Championships. ITF has now commenced re-establishing itself in South Korea, Choi Jung Hwa's country of birth. \\"As an organization, we must become sensitive to the changes around us and be able to cope, without compromising the principles ‚Äì that is, to maintain this purity of technique and philosophy that General Choi handed down to us‚Ä¶..Don't forget the standards include moral as well as technical.\\" Emigration to Canada and conviction In 1971 Choi Jung Hwa emigrated to Canada. In 1983 Choi was convicted in Canada on charges that he conspired to assassinate the President of South Korea Chun Doo-Hwan. He was sentenced in Canada, and was barred from South Korea (this has since been rescinded). He was convicted in absentia, and travelled as a Taekwon-Do instructor in the then \\"Eastern Bloc\\" nations; mainly Yugoslavia and in the DPRK as well. It wasn't until several years later that he returned to Canada to finish his prison term. References External links * Choi Jung Hwa on the ITF website. * General Choi Hong Hi on the ITF website.

Biography Born in Pittsburgh, Thomson along with his wife Alden Gay were founding members of the Screen Actors Guild. The group was founded after meetings held at the Thomsons' home during 1933. During his brief twelve-year career in front of the camera, he appeared in over 60 films. After appearing in several Broadway plays during the early and mid-1920s, Thomson would make his film debut with a starring role in 1926's Risky Business. Over the next four years, he would appear in over a dozen films, in either starring or featured roles. In 1930 alone he would appear in ten films, half of which were in starring roles, such as Lawful Larceny, which also starred Bebe Daniels and Lowell Sherman (who also directed), and Reno, whose other stars were Ruth Roland and Montagu Love; the other half would see him in featured roles as in A Notorious Affair, starring Billie Dove, Basil Rathbone, and Kay Francis. During the rest of the 1930s, he would appear in numerous films, mostly in either supporting or featured roles, such as The Little Giant (1933), starring Edward G. Robinson and Mary Astor, and Hop-Along Cassidy (1935), starring William Boyd; although he occasionally would have a starring role, as in opposite Harold Lloyd in 1932's Movie Crazy.

Evans (born 1954 in West Virginia) is an American photographer. Currently based in Marathon, Texas, Evans' work focuses on documenting the West Texas area through subject, landscape, and portrait photography. Though Evans works all around the Big Bend area of Texas, he is best known for his work within Big Bend National Park. Self Portrait Artist Biography James H. Evans moved to the Big Bend area of West Texas in December 1988. Previously, Evans worked in Philadelphia and New Jersey, shooting drag races and portraits of the drivers. He was the official photographer for United Bracket Racing Association (1975-1979.) This organization was responsible for the introduction and assimilation of bracket racing classes in the NHRA. He later moved to Corpus Christi and then on to Austin, where he worked on commercial and product photography.Stuart, Andrew. \\"Skywatchers.\\" Desert Candle Summer 2008: 4-7, 34-35. After taking a hiking trip to Big Bend National Park, Evans decided to drop everything and move to the small town of Marathon, on the outskirts of the park.Grant, Richard. \\"Big Country.\\" Sunday Telegraph Magazine 20 July 2003: 24-29. Print. Evans dedicated his life and work to documenting the Big Bend Area. His work encompasses traditional landscapes, night-scapes, portraits of the unique inhabitants of the area, and defining subject matter. In 2003 Big Bend Pictures, Evans' first book, was published; the book sparked more interest in Evans' work, allowing him to publish his second book, Crazy from the Heat, in 2011. The Weston Galleria Hotel in Dallas commissioned him in 2008 to supply photographs for their hotel. This job was pivotal for Evans, as it compelled him to begin shooting digitally. Previously his work was all shot in film, (primarily black and white, square format,) with his Hasselblad. This introduction to the \\"Digital Age\\" allowed Evans to expand his work. In newer digital pieces, there is generally a much stronger focus on color, though Evans' continues to work in black and white and in the traditional darkroom. In 2013 Evans was hired by a Texas businessman to photograph his family's ranch. For a year, Evans was given creative direction with the imagery, and the timetable of the project allowed Evans to document the ranch throughout all four seasons. The final 100+ photographs were hung in the multi-million dollar mansion on the ranch property.Spong, John. \\"James H. Evans's Ranch Project.\\" Texas Monthly. 1 Sept. 2014. Web. 14 Dec. 2014. .

A Radical Republican, he generally supported the policies of Governor William G. Brownlow, including ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. He served as chairman of the Republican State Central Committee in the late 1860s. Cate remained loyal to the Union during the Civil War. He was a delegate to the pro-Union East Tennessee Convention in 1861, and was a key organizer of the East Tennessee bridge burnings later that year. He fought for the Union Army during the war, eventually rising to the rank of captain.Oliver Perry Temple, Mary Boyce Temple (ed.), \\"Alfred M. Cate,\\" Notable Men of Tennessee (Cosmopolitan Press, 1912), pp. 85-88. Early life Cate was born in Jefferson County, Tennessee, the son of Elijah Cate, a farmer, and Nellie (Davis) Cate. When he was still very young, his parents moved to McMinn County, where they established a large plantation in the Mouse Creek Valley near Niota. By 1850, Alfred had married and moved to Ooltewah, Tennessee, in Hamilton County, where he engaged in farming.John Wilson, \\"Cates Fought in Civil War: 1 Son Murdered As Sheriff,\\" Originally published in a Chattanooga-area newspaper, date unknown (after 1982). Retrieved: 21 December 2014. Civil War During the secession crisis of late 1860 and early 1861, Cate remained loyal to the Union. His family was very divided over the issue, however. His father and two younger brothers supported secession, while three other brothers-- William T. Cate, George O. Cate, and Thomas L. Cate-- supported the Union. Alfred and his brother, George, were members of the Hamilton County delegation at the first session of the East Tennessee Convention in Knoxville in May 1861. This convention denounced secession, and would subsequently petition the Tennessee state government to allow East Tennessee to form a separate, Union-aligned state. After Confederate troops occupied East Tennessee in August 1861, William B. Carter, a staunch Unionist from Carter County, organized a conspiracy to burn nine railroad bridges across the region to make way for a Union invasion. Carter recruited Cate to burn the four bridges in the Chattanooga vicinity, namely the bridge over the Hiwassee River near Charleston, two bridges over Chickamauga Creek outside Chattanooga, and the bridge over the Tennessee River near Bridgeport, Alabama. Cate in turn recruited R.B. Rogan and James Keener to burn the Bridgeport bridge and entrusted the Chickamauga Creek bridges to William T. Cate and W.H. Crowder. Considering the Hiwassee bridge the most dangerous due to its location near a populated area (increasing the risk of getting caught), he decided to personally oversee its destruction. He was aided by Thomas L. Cate, Jesse Cleveland and Adam Thomas. The bridge burners executed their plan on the night of November 8, 1861. Rogan and Keener found the Bridgeport bridge too heavily guarded by Confederate troops, and abandoned their attempt to burn it. William Cate and W.H. Crowder, however, managed to burn the two Chickamauga Creek bridges (which were relatively close to one another, though on different rail lines). Alfred Cate and his men also managed to destroy the Hiwassee bridge and escape undetected. Cate and the southeastern Tennesseans thus accounted for three of the five bridges destroyed that night. Unbeknownst to the bridge burners, however, the Union Army had decided against an immediate invasion of the region, and Confederate authorities launched a crackdown against the region's Unionists in the weeks following the bridge-burnings. Though not suspected of being a bridge-burner, Cate's reputation as a Unionist nevertheless made him a target of the Confederate crackdown. Under threat of arrest, Cate left home for Kentucky on November 14, 1861. He briefly linked up with a group headed by fellow Hamilton County Unionist William J. Clift, but with more than a thousand Confederate troops in pursuit, this group disbanded. After a journey in which he frequently hid out in caves to avoid capture, Cate arrived in Somerset, Kentucky, in early January 1862. Cate initially joined the 1st Tennessee Brigade, commanded by James G. Spears, with the rank of lieutenant. During the Summer of 1862, he led a raid near Jonesville, Virginia, that captured several horses, wagons, and supplies, and took several Confederate troops prisoner. In September 1862, Cate was promoted to captain and placed in charge of the brigade's commissary. He accompanied the 1st Tennessee on its invasion of Middle Tennessee in late 1862, and was present at the Battle of Stones River. He later took part several battles in the Chattanooga vicinity, including Marietta, Lost Mountain, and Kennesaw Mountain.\\"The Roll of the General Assembly of Tennessee,\\" The Union Flag, 18 October 1867, p. 1. Originally published in the Nashville Press and Times. In June 1864, Cate was appointed captain of Company G of the 6th Regiment Tennessee Volunteer Infantry, commanded by General Joseph A. Cooper. He resigned his commission just two months later, however.Report of the Adjutant General of the State of Tennessee (S.C. Mercer, 1866), p. 130. After the Union Army had secured control of East Tennessee in April 1864, the East Tennessee Convention reconvened in Knoxville. Cate attended this meeting as a member of the Hamilton County delegation. He and the rest of the Hamilton delegation joined Governor Andrew Johnson and in calling for \\"immediate and unconditional emancipation.\\" There was still substantial opposition to emancipation at the Convention, however, and after four days of infighting, the Convention adjourned without taking any action.\\"Unconditional Union Meeting,\\" Nashville Daily Union, 15 March 1864, p. 1.\\"Hamilton County Convention,\\" Nashville Daily Union, 10 April 1864, p. 1. State legislature During the reorganization of the state government in 1865, Cate was elected to the Tennessee Senate seat for the Eighth district, which included the counties of Hamilton, Marion, Rhea, Bledsoe, Bradley, and Sequatchie.\\"Tennessee Senators ,\\" Tennessee State Library and Archives, 2010. Retrieved: 21 December 2014. Cate aligned with the Radical Republicans, supporters of Governor William G. Brownlow who sought retribution against ex- Confederates and civil rights for freed slaves. This legislative session quickly ratified the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and passed a controversial measure giving Brownlow unprecedented control over state elections. In July 1866, Cate was one of fourteen state senators who voted to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment, which extended civil rights to African Americans.\\"Amendments Ratified!\\" Knoxville Whig, 18 July 1866, p. 2. Cate was reelected to a second term in 1867. He was also elected chairman of the Republican State Central Committee, which coordinated party strategy and nominated candidates for elections. During the Summer of 1868, Cate angered the party's Radical wing when he voted against two contentious bills Brownlow had proposed to quell rising Ku Klux Klan violence. One bill imposed stiff penalties on anyone who aided the Klan or interfered with the election process, while the other empowered Governor Brownlow to call the state militia into service and declare martial law (with the consent of officials in the affected counties). Some leaders opposed to the bill felt that fears over Klan violence were exaggerated, while others were worried the bills would merely bring more bloodshed to the state.William Edward Hardy, \\"'Fare well to all Radicals': Redeeming Tennessee, 1869-1870,\\" PhD. diss., University of Tennessee, 2013, pp. 106-108, 118-124. During Cate's second term, he became embroiled in the conflict between Congressman William B. Stokes, leader of the party's Radical wing, and Speaker of the Tennessee Senate Dewitt Clinton Senter, the leader of the party's moderate wing. In October 1868, Cate, at the urging of Stokes, motioned to have Senter expelled from the state senate, based on a clause in the Fourteenth Amendment that barred anyone who had served in the Confederate government from serving in public office. This move stunned both Radicals and moderates, and the motion was promptly tabled (Senter had served in the state legislature in 1861 after Tennessee had joined the Confederacy, though he was generally still considered a Unionist). Cate and Stokes were assailed for this move in subsequent months. In May 1869, Cate chaired a chaotic meeting of the Republican state committee in Nashville. Although Senter had become governor following Brownlow's resignation earlier in the year, Radicals, including Cate, supported Stokes as the party's gubernatorial nominee in elections slated for that August. When Senter's supporters tried to have Knoxville minister Thomas H. Pearne installed as chairman, Cate used a parliamentary maneuver to block the motion, sparking an angry debate that lasted throughout the day. When the committee reconvened on the following day, both Cate and Pearne stood at the chairman's desk, each attempting to act as chairman. Several scuffles broke out, and Nashville police had to intervene at one point to prevent a gunfight. Failing to agree on a candidate, Radicals and moderates held separate meetings to nominate their own tickets. The Senter ticket dominated the August elections, however, effectively ending Radical control of the state government. Later life and family Following his second term, Cate returned to his farm in Ooltewah, and he remained only marginally active in state party politics.\\"State Central Committee,\\" Knoxville Chronicle, 1 July 1871, p. 2.

Cate and his wife, Louisa Jackson, had seven children. His brother, William T. Cate, served as sheriff of Hamilton County, and was killed in a gun battle in 1882. A nephew, Gus Cate, served in the state legislature in the 1880s. The home of Cate's father, Elijah, still stands near Niota, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Fisk Tire Company was an American tire company. It was a major force in the US tire industry from the 1910s to early 30s.  History  In 1898, the Spaulding and Pepper Co was sold to Noyes W. Fisk and renamed the Fisk Rubber Co. It employed more than 600 people in 1910 and more than 3,000 during World War I (with a weekly payroll averaging $48,000). By 1917, the company employed 4,500 people with a $70,000 payroll. The company was headquartered in Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts. The company's mascot, the Fisk Tire Boy, was a child dressed for bedtime, holding a lighted candle and an oversized tire. The motto said \\"Time to re-tire.\\"Early History. Printers' Ink, weekly, Dec. 26, 1912 p. 78. \\"Development of 'Fisk Boy' as Trade Figure.\\" In the 1920s, Fisk also had plants in New Bedford, Massachusetts, Jewett City, Connecticut, Pawtucket, Rhode Island. In the 1920s, there were Fisk Retail Stores in 40 states; and the Chicopee plant turned out 5,000 tires a day. The company experienced a gradual decline in market share, forced down into the category of a medium- sized firm. It was an industry leader but was in receivership from 1931 to 1933; the receivers overseeing the company cut the prices of tires in January 1933 as part of an overall market discounting trend. The company rejected a quota system in the market proposed by the Retail Rubber Tire (RRT) authority under the National Recovery Administration (NRA) and also was against a system of price differentials by the RRT, as they feared it would let the larger tire companies control the retail price of every tire manufactured in the USA. Fisk was forced out of the market by \\"competition and systematic price discrimination\\", and the company's demise was accelerated by the du Pont family's taking an interest in the United States Rubber Company (which also controlled General Motors), in the OEM tire market. The domination of the replacement tire market (among, for example, bus and taxi companies) by the four leading tire manufacturers was at the expense of Fisk and other medium- sized firms while reducing profit margins for all. The company had 121 retail tire stores in 1930, but only three by 1934. The firm was unable to sustain its stores; during the Great Depression, the company discontinued two-thirds of its dealerships by excluding those with less than $200 in annual sales. Fisk had two subsidiary companies that supplied lower-cost tires, the Badger Rubber Works and the Federal Rubber Company. The Fisk enterprise, as a whole, was acquired by United States Rubber (later Uniroyal) in 1940. After having been dormant since the [1970s], the Fisk brand was revived by Discount Tire in 1996 under an agreement with Michelin, which had purchased Uniroyal in 1990.  Advertising  Paul Martin. The company was known for its \\"Time to Re- Tire\\" tagline, featuring a young, pajama-clad boy with his right arm encircling a tire and his left hand holding a candle. The boy was designed in 1910Printers' Ink, December 26, 1912. \\"Development of Fisk Boy as Trade Figure.\\" by Burr Giffin, an agency art director who was still awake at an early hour. The next day, he presented his sketch to his manager, who liked it so much that it was made into a poster for the Fisk Company.

Early life and education In December 1924, Adrian's mother sued his father for divorce and custody of Adrian and his sister, Marian. After his parents' divorce Adrian relocated with his mother and sister to his mother's hometown of Davenport, Iowa. Having been dissuaded against pursuing music while still a high school student, Adrian pursued political science at Cornell College. With the US entrance into World War II, Adrian enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces in 1943 where he served in the Weather Wing. After his military service ended in 1946, Adrian returned to Cornell College, graduating in 1947 with a Bachelor's degree. Adrian was elected a member of Phi Beta Kappa at Cornell. Adrian met his future wife Audrey Nelson, a euphonium player, at a concert in Iowa. Her father was a physics professor at Cornell. They married in 1946. Adrian immediately enrolled at the University of Minnesota to study urban politics under William Anderson. He completed his master's degree in 1948 and his doctorate in 1950. Adrian accepted a post-doctoral fellowship in 1954 from the Ford Foundation and attended the University of Copenhagen to study the developing welfare state there. Career Adrian started teaching at Wayne University in 1949. After returning from his post-doctoral fellowship in the Summer of 1955 he started teaching at Michigan State University in 1955. Through 1956 and 1957 he served as an administrative assistant to G. Mennen Williams, then Governor of Michigan. During his time in Michigan Adrian wrote two articles, Some General Characteristics of Nonpartisan Elections and A Typology for Nonpartisan Elections, that are considered the seminal works in the study of non-partisanship. Adrian wrote a third, The Origin of Minnesota's Nonpartisan Legislature, specifically discussing the \\"political accident\\" of nonpartisanship in the Minnesota Legislature. Adrian was promoted to associate professor in 1957 and again to chair of the political science department in 1963. Adrian was recruited by fellow University of Minnesota-alum Ivan Hinderaker, the Chancellor of University of California, Riverside (UCR), to join the faculty. Adrian served as chair of the political science department from 1966 until his retirement on June 30, 1988 as the effects of his diabetes hampered his ability to teach. Adrian's 1977 book, Governing Urban America, was considered the most cited textbook in the field of urban politics. Adrian was a member of the American Political Science Association, the American Society for Public Administration and the American Association of University Professors.

Established to monitor the implementation of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, better known as Helsinki Accords, it was the first human rights organization in Lithuania. The group published over 30 documents that exposed religious repressions, limitations on freedom of movement, political abuse of psychiatry, discrimination of minorities, persecution of human right activists, and other violations of human rights in the Soviet Union. Most of the documents reached the West and were published by other human rights groups. Members of the group were persecuted by the Soviet authorities. Its activities diminished after it lost members due to deaths, emigration, or imprisonment, though it was never formally disbanded. Some of the group's functions were taken over by the Catholic Committee for the Defense of the Rights of Believers, founded by five priests in 1978. Upon his release from prison, Viktoras Petkus reestablished the Lithuanian Helsinki Group in 1988. History Inspired by the Moscow Helsinki Group, the Lithuanian grouped was founded by five dissidents of different walks of life: Jesuit priest Karolis Garuckas, Jewish \\"refusenik\\" Eitanas Finkel≈°teinas, poet and deportee Ona Lukauskaitƒó-Po≈°kienƒó, twice- imprisoned Catholic dissident Viktoras Petkus, and poet Tomas Venclova. The formation was formally announced in a press conference to foreign journalists from Reuters and Chicago Tribune on November 27 or December 1, 1976 in the apartment of Yuri Orlov (Natan Sharansky acted as an interpreter to English). The group did not have a more formal structure or a defined leader, though Petkus was its unofficial leader and driving force. The various backgrounds of the founders were intended to serve a wide range interests. The group did not want to become yet another Catholic or nationalistic dissident group; instead it strove to work on fundamental and universal human rights that would attract intelligentsia, city residents, non-Lithuanians, and others. The group did not limit its reports to Lithuania or Lithuanians; for example, it reported on arrests of three Estonians (Mart Nikius, Erik Udam, and Enn Tarto), discrimination of 49 Volga German families living in Radvili≈°kis, and persecution of a Russian Pentecostal living in Vilnius. The group produced not only reports concerning specific individuals, but also reports on broader issue. In 1977, the group produced reports on situation of the former political prisoners, focusing on prohibition to return to Lithuania even after their prison term ended, and the Catholic church. It also sent a report to the Follow-up Meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in Belgrade (4 October 1977 ‚Äì 8 March 1978). In January 1979, Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe nominated Helsinki Groups of the Soviet Union, including the Lithuanian group, for the Nobel Peace Prize. Petkus hoped to establish a broader Baltic organization that would represent all three Baltic states, but these plans were abandoned after his arrest in August 1977. After the arrest of Petkus, there was a lull in the group's activity. It became more active again in early 1979 and published further documents primarily protesting arrests of various dissidents, including Antanas Terleckas, and statements critical of the Czechoslovakian government and the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. However, arrests of four other members effectively discontinued the activities of the Lithuanian Helsinki Group. The group was reestablished in 1988 when glasnost and perestroika policies allowed freer political expressions. On November 20, 1988, the group admitted three new members Balys Gajauskas, Kazimieras Kry≈æeviƒçius, and Nijolƒó Sad≈´naitƒó. The group joined the independence movement and published many reports and documents (some 100 documents in 1991 alone). The documents were collected and published in two volumes by the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania in 1999 () and by the Lithuanian Human Rights Association in 2006 (). Many members of the group, including Viktoras Petkus, joined the Lithuanian Human Rights Association, the first official human rights organization established in 1989. The Helsinki Group continues as an official group; in March 2014, it became co-founder of the Lithuanian Human Rights Coordination Centre (). Membership Tomas Venclova, a son of Antanas Venclova, a prominent Soviet writer, was allowed to emigrate to the United States just two months after the group's formation. Viktoras Petkus was arrested on August 23, 1977. After a trial in 1978, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 5 years in exile. He was freed after the introduction of glasnost in 1988. Karolis Garuckas died of cancer on April 5, 1979; Ona Lukauskaitƒó-Po≈°kienƒó died on December 4, 1983. Eitan Finkelstein resigned from the group in 1979 and was allowed to emigrate to Israel in December 1983. Besides the five founding members, the group added six others. Bronius Laurinaviƒçius, a Catholic priest, was admitted in January 1979 but he died in a suspicious traffic accident on November 25, 1981. In November 1979, the group added Algirdas Statkeviƒçius, a physician and former member of the Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force, and Meƒçislovas Jureviƒçius, a former Lithuanian partisan. Vytautas Skuodis, a professor of geology, also joined the group but was arrested in November 1979 for the possession of a 300-page manuscript titled Spiritual Genocide of Lithuania. On February 14, 1980, Statkeviƒçius was arrested and transferred to a psychiatric hospital. The group protested the arrests and wanted to admit Vytautas Vaiƒçi≈´nas, a worker, but Jureviƒçius and Vaiƒçi≈´nas were arrested on March 25, 1981. Therefore, in early 1981, Lukauskaitƒó-Po≈°kienƒó was as the only member of the group, but due to poor health she was unable to continue group's activities. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the reestablished group added many new members. In total, the group had 41 official members plus about 84 unofficial members. Among them were Vytautas Bogu≈°is, Gintautas Ie≈°mantas, Nijolƒó Sad≈´naitƒó, and Kazys Saja. Imprisoned members The following members of the Group were arrested and sentenced by the Soviet authorities: *Viktoras Petkus was sentenced on 13 July 1978, to three years in prison, seven years in special regimen camp and five years of internal exile for \\"anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda\\"; *Algirdas Statkeviƒçius was sentenced on 11 August 1980, to forcible psychiatric treatment after being arrested on 14 February 1980, reportedly for \\"anti- Soviet activities\\"; *Vytautas Skuodys was sentenced on 22 December 1980, to seven years strict regimen camp and five years of internal exile for \\"anti- Soviet agitation and propaganda\\"; *Meƒçislovas Jureviƒçius was sentenced on 25 June 1981, to three years of strict regimen camp for \\"organization of religious processions\\"; *Vytautas Vaiƒçi≈´nas was sentenced on 25 June 1981, to two and half years of general regimen camp for \\"organization of religious processions\\".

Downing, Paula King, Paula Downing King and P. K. McAllister, was an American science fiction writer. She published eight SF novels between 1990 and 1996. Her Cloudships of Orion trilogy of space operas features an itinerant family of Gypsies who travel through the galaxy in their spaceship in search of resources to mine.Paula E. Downing at SF Encyclopedia Biography Born in Portland, Oregon, King lived in Walla Walla, Washington, after she retired from her 35-year legal career. After 15 years in Oregon as a civil lawyer, she moved to Arizona in 1995, and worked as Public Defender for the White Mountain Apache Tribe and juvenile prosecutor for Navajo County in Holbrook, Arizona. She also taught criminal justice and history part-time at the local community college named Saint Britain Hamm. Paula tried to write stories in 1976 (when she was working as a tax lady for IRS), and gave up in despair. After she decided to go to law school and was selected as Articles Editor for the University of Oregon School of Law, she edited for the law journal, then clerked for three years for a local federal judge, writing eight hours a day. In time, she felt she had learned some of the craft, and tried again. She sold her first two novels late in 1989 to two separate publishers, and settled with Del Rey for three more novels. Her agent recommended she try another pen name to assist sales, and so she published her \\"Cloudships of Orion\\" trilogy with Roc under the name \\"P.K. McAllister.\\" Her \\"gypsies in space\\" trilogy garnered good reviews. A few years later, under yet another pen name, Diana Marcellas, Paula sold her fantasy trilogy, \\"Witch of Two Suns\\" to Tor. Although she continued to write regularly during her subsequent lawyer years, her job required a lot of overtime, enough she often gave away some of her overtime hours to her staff at the Tribe, and enough to add up to sixty hours a week when she spent four years as juvenile prosecutor. In March 2012 she fell off her porch and fractured her lumbar spine, eventually needing surgery in November 2012. Her recovery took an entire year, and she tried to work half-time for a local law firm, but was eventually pronounced disabled. This note is by Paula herself: \\"In May 2015 Paula's father died and she inherited his house in Walla Walla, Washington, her hometown‚Äîand so she has moved home! . And suddenly she finds herself writing full-time, a dream of her whole life. The disability limits things a bit, but she hopes to write another \\"Eleven,\\" as she calls her published novels, and find a way to share those stories with her readers. Some of Paula's stories still in her head date back to college, and she now has time to start writing some of them, as well as the new stories. She has read SF since the age of 12, adores the genre for its innovation and wide horizons, and could happily spend the rest of her retirement, as long as it lasts (she is now a youthful 64) writing SF.\\" Paula Downing King passed on December 17, 2017 in her Walla Walla, Washington home.http://www.union-bulletin.com/obituaries/paula- king/article_65c31410-e444-11e7-bf18-83686a90faf5.html Bibliography  Novels  *\\"Mad Roy's Light\\" (New York: Baen Books, 1990) as Paula King *\\"Rinn's Star\\" (New York: Ballantine Books/Del Rey, 1990) as Paula E.

Brinsley then fled into the New York City Subway, where he committed suicide. Background and events The shooting occurred just weeks after a grand jury decided not to indict NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo, who was responsible for the death of Eric Garner on July 17, 2014. The grand jury's decision resulted in widespread protests in New York City and across the nation against police brutality and the lack of accountability for it. The protests also coincided with widespread protests in response to a grand jury's decision not to indict Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9. Brinsley's motive to kill the NYPD officers was motivated by outrage over the two deaths. Myrtle‚ÄìWilloughby Avenues subway station, where Brinsley killed himself after fatally shooting two NYPD officers Before Brinsley arrived in Brooklyn by bus, he shot and seriously wounded his 29-year-old ex-girlfriend, Shaneka Nicole Thompson, in the Baltimore suburb of Owings Mills, Maryland, on Saturday morning. The second shooting occurred at Myrtle Avenue and Tompkins Avenue, a busy intersection in Brooklyn near the Tompkins Houses. Brinsley approached the passenger window of an NYPD patrol car occupied by Rafael Ramos, 40, and Wenjian Liu, 32, of Brooklyn's 84th Precinct. He then fired a semiautomatic handgun four times through the open window, striking Ramos and Liu in the head and upper body, killing both officers instantly. Two Con Ed workers who witnessed the shooting notified police. After NYPD officers responding to the scene chased him onto the subway, he committed suicide with the handgun in the Myrtle‚ÄìWilloughby Avenues () subway station, according to police. Brinsley and the two police officers were taken to Woodhull Hospital, and all were pronounced dead on arrival. Victims NYPD portraits of Rafael Ramos (left) and Wenjian Liu (right), who were killed in a shooting on December 20, 2014 Rafael Ramos Rafael Ramos (December 9, 1974 ‚Äì December 20, 2014), married with two sons and a longtime resident of Glendale, Queens, had joined the NYPD as a school safety agent, before being promoted to officer in January 2012. He was active in his church, Christ Tabernacle in Glendale, and had once studied at a seminary. He had just completed a training course to become a volunteer chaplain. He planned to eventually join the ministry when he retired from the police force. The Silver Shield Foundation, founded by the late New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, announced it would pay for the education of Ramos' 13-year-old son. Bowdoin College said it would provide full financial aid to Ramos' elder son, who is a sophomore at the school, so he could complete his education. A funeral service for Ramos, the largest police funeral in the city‚Äôs history, was held on December 27 in Glendale with over 100,000 people present, including many politicians such as Vice President Joe Biden; the service itself from start to finish was almost five hours long and was broadcast around the world, with many people coming from across the country to pay their respects to the slain officer. Afterward, Ramos' body was transported to St. John Cemetery in nearby Middle Village, where he was laid to rest. Hundreds of officers turned their backs to Mayor Bill de Blasio as he delivered his eulogy. Wenjian Liu Wenjian Liu ( April 8, 1982 ‚Äì December 20, 2014) was the only son of Chinese immigrants Weitang Liu and Xiuyan Li. He and his family came to the United States from Taishan, Guangdong in China, when he was 12 years old. He was a seven-year veteran officer of the NYPD who had married Peixia Chen in October 2014. He had no children at the time of death. Following a wake on January 3 containing elements of Chinese and Buddhist rituals, a funeral service for Liu took place on January 4 at the Ralph Aievoli & Son Funeral Home in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn. In protest of de Blasio's perceived lack of support for them, some attending police officers turned their backs on the video screen showing de Blasio's eulogy speech; however, de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton were also saluted at the ceremony. Afterward, Liu's body was transported to Cypress Hills Cemetery in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn, and was laid to rest. After his burial, a post burial dinner, a Chinese tradition for honoring the deceased and giving his spirit a good send-off to heaven, was held in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. In July 2017, Chen gave birth to a girl named Angelina using preserved sperm obtained from Liu. Perpetrator Ismaaiyl Abdullah Brinsley (October 31, 1986 ‚Äì December 20, 2014) had a long criminal record and was estranged from his family prior to the shooting. He was born in Brooklyn. He had an arrest record for weapons possession and robbery, which amounted to a total of 19 arrests in Georgia and Ohio. He was convicted of felony gun possession in Georgia, where he was living at the time of the shooting. Brinsley allegedly had ties to the Black Guerrilla Family, a prison gang that was reportedly planning revenge attacks on police officers according to police informants, and the Nuwaubian Nation, a black-supremacist cult originating in Georgia. An unnamed federal law enforcement source has been quoted as saying there were no apparent ties. Daniel McCall, who was appointed to represent Brinsley in Georgia, said Brinsley was not difficult to represent and that no psychiatric problems were noticed at that time. On the day of the attack, Brinsley had tried to commit suicide with his gun before killing the police officers, but he was talked out of it by his girlfriend, Shaneka Nicole Thompson, whom he then shot. Brinsley also attempted suicide a year previously. After the shooting, Brinsley reportedly called Thompson's mother and other family members and claimed the shooting was an accident. Brinsley wrote on his Instagram account of his intentions to kill police as retribution for the recent deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. In the post, which he made later that day while on a bus to New York City, he wrote, \\"I'm putting Wings on Pigs Today ... They Take 1 of Ours ... Lets Take 2 of Theirs. \\" By then, the Baltimore County Police Department had been tracking Brinsley's movements from Baltimore to New York City, and sent a fax to the NYPD about his intentions just a minute before the killings occurred. Reactions Current and former government officials U.S. President Barack Obama stated, \\"I unconditionally condemn today's murder of two police officers in New York City. Two brave men won't be going home to their loved ones tonight, and for that, there is no justification. The officers who serve and protect our communities risk their own safety for ours every single day ‚Äì and they deserve our respect and gratitude every single day. Tonight, I ask people to reject violence and words that harm, and turn to words that heal ‚Äì prayer, patient dialogue, and sympathy for the friends and family of the fallen.\\" Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, a former police officer, said, \\"Those who were calling for police reform were not calling for police retribution... blood is not on the hands of the mayor.\\" Former New York Governor George Pataki blamed current officials. He tweeted, \\"Sickened by these barbaric acts, which sadly are a predictable outcome of divisive anti-cop rhetoric of Eric Holder and Mayor de Blasio.\\" The former Mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, responded that this is untrue and categorized this rhetoric as an over reaction. Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani accused Obama of creating a hostile environment toward the police, stating: \\"We've had four months of propaganda starting with the President, that everybody should hate the police. I don't care how you want to describe it, that's what those protests are all about.\\" NYPD officers and police union As Mayor de Blasio and his entourage walked through the third-floor corridor of Woodhull Hospital, where the two police officers had been pronounced dead hours earlier, dozens of NYPD police silently turned their backs on the mayor in protest for his perceived lack of support for them. Earlier, de Blasio had approached a group of cops in the hospital and told them, \\"We're all in this together.\\" In response, one officer said, \\"No we're not.\\" The president of the police union group Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, Patrick J. Lynch, blamed de Blasio and the protesters of the grand jury dismissal in the Garner case for inciting hostility toward the NYPD. He said, \\"There's blood on many hands tonight. Those that incited violence on the street in the guise of protest, that tried to tear down what New York City police officers did every day. We tried to warn it must not go on, it shouldn't be tolerated. That blood on the hands starts at the steps of City Hall in the office of the mayor.\\" Fraternal Order of Police President Chuck Canterbury asked Congress to consider making crimes against police officers fall under the category of hate crimes. He said, \\"My thoughts and prayers over the past few weeks have been with the families of officers who were, with malice and forethought, gunned down just because they served as police officers.\\" Civil rights groups Protest organizer Charles Wade said about civil rights groups, \\"We've all said that this is a horrible thing that shouldn't have happened. I say time and time again that I'm against police violence, and I'm not against police officers in general. I have an issue with improper policing, police violence and police impunity.\\" Reverend Al Sharpton said, \\"From the beginning, we have stressed that this is a pursuit of justice to make the system work fairly for everyone. This is not about trying to take things into our own hands. That does not solve the problem of police brutality.\\" The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People issued a statement condemning the murders. Public Pastor Michael A. Walrond Jr. of the First Corinthian Baptist Church in Harlem, said, \\"This tragic moment may be an opportunity for people to understand each other. The pain of a mother whose son lay dead on the ground is the same pain of a 13-year-old boy who lost his police officer father. My hope is that this will shock people into coming together.\\" According to The Daily Beast, some bystanders at the crime scene reportedly cheered and expressed their support for the attack. Entertainment Many rappers, such as Azealia Banks, and Lecrae, also posted to Twitter, denouncing the murder-suicide. Rapper The Game tweeted, \\"I guess y‚Äôall 'can‚Äôt breathe' either\\", resulting in backlash. Media Bob McManus, a columnist for the New York Post, criticized government officials for failing to condemn the blood-lust of protesters who demanded \\"dead cops\\" in retaliation for the death of Eric Garner. While not blaming the shooting on political leaders, an editorial in The Wall Street Journal argued that political leaders failed to respond to the protesters' chant--\\"What do we want? Dead cops.\\"--and that such a failure \\"contributed to a public climate of suspicion and hate against police in which a man like Ismaaiyl Brinsley can in his deranged mind think it is justified to stalk and execute two cops on the beat.\\" Newsday defended New York City Mayor de Blasio, saying he did not create the animosity towards the police, which is long standing in some quarters; the editorial pointed out that the Mayor spoke out against previous physical attacks on police officers by protesters. As a result of the protest movement, there have also been calls to reform or abolish the grand jury process. Families Jaden Ramos, son of Officer Ramos, posted on Facebook, \\"Today I had to say bye to my father. He was [there] for me every day of my life, he was the best father I could ask for. It's horrible that someone gets shot dead just for being a police officer. Everyone says they hate cops but they are the people that they call for help. I will always love you and I will never forget you. RIP Dad.\\" Richard Gonzales, a cousin of Ramos, urged citizens to come together and forgive the shooter. Aftermath On December 22, de Blasio asked that anti-police protestors \\"suspend demonstrations.\\" Earlier in the day, NYPD Commissioner William Bratton said the killings were a \\"direct spinoff of this issue [of the protests]\\". Some protesters issued blanket condemnations of the police as \\"racists and worse\\" according to The New York Times. While the investigations into Brinsley's motivation continues, Bratton has concluded that \\"the protests served as an inspiration for the disturbed man.\\" Six people were arrested for making terroristic threats against NYPD officers in the week following the shooting.\\"Two more NY men arrested in threats against police\\", Reuters, December 25, 2014. After a police union directive in December 2014, the police have been dispatching two cars in response to every call, contributing to a lack of manpower, and as a result, a 94% drop in summonses for minor offenses and a 66% reduction in arrests. Beating of Karim Baker In April 2016, officers Angelo Pampena and Robert Carbone were charged with the retaliatory beating of mail carrier Karim Baker, who unwittingly provided Brinsley with directions. The beating was alleged to have occurred when the officers approached Baker in October 2015; according to the Queens district attorney, Baker was seated in his car when the officers punched and kicked him multiple times and dragged him from his car. Baker's lawyer said Baker sustained injures to his spine, knee and face, causing Baker to be unable to return to work. Pampena stated in a criminal court complaint that the officers approached Baker because he had parked his car directly in front of a fire hydrant, but surveillance video footage showed Baker's car parked more than 15 feet away from the fire hydrant. There were audio recordings of the encounter based on calls to 911 from Baker's handphone during the time. The criminal case against Baker was dropped with the file sealed. In March 2017, they were found not guilty of all charges by judge Michael Aloise, and their case was sealed.

Early life Solly Sachs was born in 1900 in Kamai, Lithuania to Abraham Saks and Hannah Rivkin. His early childhood education was in Hebrew and the study of the Talmud. In 1914, he and his family had emigrated to South Africa and settled in Ferreirasdorp, Johannesburg. He left school in Standard 5 working as shop assistant and aside from organising a union for shop assistants he also studied for his matric. By 1919, he was active in the Reef Shop Assistants' Union. He had an interest in politics and was drawn to socialism joining the Communist Party of South Africa in 1919 and the Communist Youth League in 1921. By 1930, Sachs was a member of the Central Committee of the South African Communist Party. He started an engineering degree in 1924 at the University of the Witwatersrand but left to tour the Soviet Union and England before returning to the university to study law, English and economics. Marriage Solly married Rae Ginsberg in 1926 and had two sons, one of whom is the anti-apartheid lawyer Albie Sachs. The marriage lasted until 1942 when he married Dulcie Hartwell and had a further son and a foster son but this second marriage ended in 1951. Trade Unionism Known for his unionism, in 1926 he was part of the national executive committee of the South African Trades and Labour Council and by 14 November 1928, secretary of the Witwatersrand Taylors' Association (WTA). Noticing that women garment workers, consisting of working class Afrikaners were not represented on union committees, he became general secretary of the WTA, changing its constitution in July 1929, and renaming it the Garment Workers' Union of South Africa (GWU) in 1930. He encouraged the Afrikaner women to become activists and organisers. Its membership during 1930/31 stood at 1700 members, two-thirds were garment workers made up mostly of Afrikaans women though men made up the union committee but this would change and by 1939, all were women. The early years in this union involved defending work conditions and employment security in the garment industry. Using the courts and strikes he ensured garment workers wages increased from 23s/week in 1928 to ¬£2/week by 1938, paid leave rose from three days to ten, they received morning and afternoon breaks and created a sick fund. By 1938, GWU membership had grown to 7000 members. Because of his socialist views, he ran into difficulties with the Communist Party of South Africa, who believed his union activities were not revolutionary enough and so he was expelled from the party in 1931. He managed two GWU general strikes in 1931 over wage negotiations and again in 1932 when the over wage negotiations broke down. These strikes resulted in his arrest and later banning from the Witwatersrand for twelve months by Justice Minister Oswald Pirow which would later be reduced to six months by Jan Smuts. Pirow had used the strike as back drop to a by-election his Nationalist party was attempting to win in Germiston by describing the strike as communist inspired. His control of the GWU would bring him into conflict with the Afrikaner nationalist elite during the preparations for the 1938 Great Trek Centenary when Afrikaans female garment union workers wished to take part when this elite attempted to discourage their participation. They were regarded by the Afrikaner elite as poor and passive victims of Jewish communism unable to stand-up for themselves which was going to destroy the Afrikaner people. They would later be accepted to join the Trek celebrations if they participated as members of the volk (the people) and not as members of the GWU. Sachs help form a fund for unemployed clothing workers who had been excluded from the Unemployment Insurance Fees (UIF) enacted in 1939, their inclusion would only occur later in 1946. In 1946, Sachs joined the South African Labour Party and by 1952 he had become their national treasurer. During the 1948 South African elections, which the National Party later won, the Nationalists would use Solly Sachs influence in the GWU as an example of the threat of communism in South Africa. In May 1952, the Apartheid governments Minister of Justice, C.R. Swart served two notices on Sachs in relation to the Suppression of Communism Act 1950. He was ordered to resign from the GWU in 30 days and banned from various organisations and secondly he was restricted to the Transvaal and attending meetings. Later that same month he was arrested after attending a protest meeting by the GWU in Johannesburg which was broken up by the police. After leaving court he attended another protest a few days later and was again arrested and bailed later sentenced in July to two offences of six months hard labour suspended for two years. Sachs had not been a member of the CPSA for many years when he and many others had been purged from the party in the 1930s. Exile Solly went into exile to England on 30 January 1953. He took up a two-year fellowship at the University of Manchester and a years research post at the University of London. He also ran unsuccessfully as a Labour candidate in Sheffield. He continued to protest against the South Africa government in London after his son Albie was arrested and demonstrated again in 1961 against the Sharpeville massacre. He would die in London on 30 July 1976.

He was a professor of psychology at the New School for Social Research, where he served for many years as director of clinical training. He was also a faculty member at New York University's postdoctoral program in psychoanalysis NYU Postdoc faculty profile, accessed 1/2015 and The Stephen A. Mitchell Center for Relational Studies. He was co-founder and co-chair (along with Lewis Aron and Adrienne Harris) of The Sandor Ferenczi Center at the New School for Social Research. In addition he was past-president of The International Association for Relational Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy.  Early Life  Jeremy D. Safran was born on April 23, 1952 in Calgary, Canada to Jewish parents. Though Safran was raised Jewish and identified as culturally Jewish throughout his life, he found a spiritual home within his practice of Buddhism. Safran earned his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the University of British Columbia in 1982.  Professional life  After finishing his Ph.D. in 1982, Safran became the director of the Cognitive Therapy Unit at the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry in Toronto from 1986 until 1990 when he was appointed Associate Professor of Psychology at The Derner Institute for Advanced Psychological Studies at Adelphi University in Garden City, New York. Safran held this position until 1993 when he was appointed Professor of Psychology and Director of Clinical Training at The New School for Social Research in Manhattan. Safran would hold this position until his death in 2018. Safran joined the faculty at the New School for Social Research shortly after the program had been placed on probation by the American Psychological Association. Through his work as Director of Clinical Training, Safran \\"not only to move the Clinical Psychology Program to full accreditation, but to make it the vibrant, respected program it is today.\\" While at the New School for Social Research, Safran established a training collaboration with Beth Israel Medical Center (now defunct), the S√°ndor Ferenczi Center, The Center for Alliance-Focused Training, and the New School Psychotherapy Research Program. Safran underwent psychoanalytic training at the Postdoctoral Program at New York University. Safran would later hold a faculty position within this program, in addition to his post at the New School for Social Research.  Brief Relational Therapy  Jeremy Safran, in collaboration with J. Christopher Muran and others, developed Brief Relational Therapy (BRT). BRT is an evidence based psychotherapy which focuses on short-term treatment and integrates principles of mindfulness practice with Safran's research in Relational Psychoanalysis, emotion-focused theory, and the therapeutic alliance. The emphasis in Brief Relational Therapy is on \\"mindfulness-in-action\\" or the process of bringing mindful awareness to the patients self-defeating patterns. Self-defeating patterns, which take place outside of the patient's conscious awareness, can lead to chronic unhappiness, anxiety, emotional turbulence, isolation and other psychiatric concerns. Brief Relational Therapy focuses on helping patients become aware of and change their self-defeating patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting which play out in relationships with other. By addressing these patterns, BRT was shown to be an effective and empirically supported psychotherapy treatment.  Contributions  Safran was known for his contributions in a variety of areas within psychology and psychoanalysis. His early theoretical work in collaboration with Les Greenberg became the foundation for the development of emotion-focused therapy. He was also an early innovator in the refinement of cognitive theory and practice through his incorporation of principles from interpersonal theory and emotion theory and research. Safran was also known for his contributions to the field of psychoanalysis, publishing numerous articles on the subject. Safran's work emphasized the development and refinement of relational psychoanalytic theory and practice. Safran was known for his writing and teaching on the topic of psychoanalysis and Buddhism.Safran, J.D. (ed.) (2003). Psychoanalysis and Buddhism: An Unfolding Dialogue. Boston: Wisdom Publications. As a psychotherapy researcher, Safran played a critical role in research on the Therapeutic Alliance and treatment impasses. His work introduced new ways of conceptualizing the Therapeutic Alliance, the function of \\"Ruptures\\" within it, and developing methods for \\"Repairing\\" it. His empirical research program in this area, in collaboration with J. Christopher Muran and other colleagues, continues to influence researchers and clinicians in North America, Europe and Latin America. Safran published several books including: Psychoanalysis and Psychoanalytic Therapies (2012); Psychoanalysis & Buddhism: An Unfolding Dialogue (2003); \\"Negotiating the Therapeutic Alliance: A Relational Treatment Guide\\" (2000); Widening the Scope of Cognitive Therapy (1998); Interpersonal Process in Cognitive Therapy (1990); and Emotion in Psychotherapy (1987).  Death  Safran was found dead in his home in Brooklyn, New York on May 7, 2018, of repeated hammer blows, victim of what police believe was a botched burglary.http://pix11.com/2018/05/07/man-killed-during-burglary-in-process-at- ditmas-park-home/ Mirzo Atadzhanov, 28, was found hiding in the house's basement, arrested and charged with murder.  Legacy  Safran's legacy endures in the form of a yearly memorial lecture series, hosted by the department of psychology at the New School for Social Research, in conjunction with the S√°ndor Ferenczi Center. Psychologist and psychoanalyst Nancy McWilliams Ph.D. was the first invited lecturer in the series. Upon his death, Safran had a collection of nearly 3,000 books on topics ranging from psychology and psychoanalysis to religion, philosophy, art, literature, and medicine. These books, donated to the Clinical Psychology Group of the NSSR, form the basis for the Jeremy D. Safran Reading Room and Library- dedicated on December 5th, 2018. The New School Psychotherapy Program, founded by Safran, was renamed as The Safran Center for Psychological Services in his honor. The Safran Center is a low-cost clinic in New York City which provides psychodynamic psychotherapy, in the style of Safran, as well as psychological assessment to the public. The Safran Center serves as a main training clinic for students within the NSSR's Clinical Psychology Ph.D. program. The Center also maintains an active psychotherapy research program. The Safran Center names a select group of Clinical Associates each year, consisting of distinguished clinical psychologists and psychoanalysts, who serve as clinical consultants and supervisors for students.

Dugger attended UT and was editor of The Daily Texan 1950-1951. He was the founding editor of The Texas Observer from 1954 to 1961. Later he served as the Observer‚Äôs publisher, spending more than 40 years with the political newsmagazine. Dugger has published hundreds of articles in Harper's Magazine, The Nation, The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly, The Progressive and other periodicals. In 2011 Dugger won the George Polk Award in recognition of his lifelong achievements in journalism. The following year he was dubbed the \\"godfather of progressive journalism in Texas\\" in an in-depth feature published in the Austin American Statesman by Brad Buchholz. Political involvement In 1952 Dugger, along with Ralph Yarborough, John Henry Faulk, and others campaigned against Governor Allan Shivers, a Democrat who supported the Republican Party presidential candidate, Dwight Eisenhower. Shivers accused Dugger and his friends of being communists. Dugger criticized Lyndon B. Johnson and his shift away from the left of the Democratic Party when he came under the influence of Herman Brown and George R. Brown. \\"The alliance (of Brown & Root and Johnson) became common knowledge as his political identity changed from left to right before everyone's eyes.\\" Dugger said. In 1996, Ronnie Dugger also co-founded The Alliance for Democracy, a national grassroots populist organization. In 2000 Dugger sought the Green Party's nomination for the U.S. Senate in New York. Dugger used his 2011 George Polk Award acceptance speech to question the nuclear policy of mutually assured destruction, saying, \\"Why are nuclear weapons called weapons of mass destruction when morally they are weapons of mass murder?\\" This continued his long vocal concern about nuclear weapons going back to his questioning of LBJ about how many would be killed in a nuclear war up to expressing doubts when President Obama calls for a nuclear-free world. The Texas Observer Dugger and his friends decided to build The Texas Observer into an independent liberal weekly paper. From the first \\"I sought to practice journalism according to three basic standards, accuracy, fairness instead of 'objectivity,' and moral seriousnes..\\" He went on to mentor and influence progressive Texas journalists Willie Morris, Molly Ivins, Billy Lee Brammer, Lawrence Goodwyn, Kaye Northcott, and Jim Hightower. Teaching career Dugger taught at the University of Virginia, Hampshire College, and the University of Illinois. He also held fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

On the afternoon of August 15, 1959, the Boeing 707 operating the flight crashed near the Calverton airport, killing all five crew members aboard. This was the first accident to ever involve a Boeing 707, which had only gone into service in October of the previous year. Aircraft The aircraft was a Boeing 707-123 with registration N7514A, nicknamed \\"Flagship Connecticut\\". The aircraft in question's first flight was earlier in the year, and when the crash occurred, it had accumulated 736 total flight hours. The 707s had gone into service with American on January 25, 1959, with flights from New York to Los Angeles. The Calverton airfield was used frequently by American Airlines for training purposes for crew members on 707s, and was known then as the Grumman Aircraft Corp. field.http://www3.gendisasters.com/new-york/3981/calverton,-ny-training- flight-crash-kills-five,-aug-1959 Crew There were five people onboard the aircraft. Captain Harry C. Job acted as the instructor for the flight, with Captains Fred W. Jeberjahn and William T. Swain onboard as captain trainees, and Flight Engineer Arthur Anderson acted as the instructor for Flight Engineer trainee Allen Freeman.https://www.baaa- acro.com/sites/default/files/import/uploads/2017/10/N7514A.pdf When the 707 departed Idlewild, Jeberjahn was in the captain's seat, Job occupied the first officer's seat, Swain was in the second officer's seat, Freeman occupied the engineer's seat and Anderson took the jump seat. https://www.baaa- acro.com/sites/default/files/import/uploads/2017/10/N7514A.pdf Crash The 707 departed Idlewild at 1:40pm, accomplished high altitude air work after takeoff to permit sufficient fuel burn-off for airport transition training which was planned at Calverton, and arrived there around 3:11pm. Flight 514 accomplished several maneuvers, including full-stop landings, crosswind landings and takeoffs, a high off-set approach, simulated engine out landings, and a no-flap aborted approach to landing. The aircraft did not retract its landing gear following the last aborted approach to landing on Runway 23, but continued in the traffic pattern at an estimated altitude between 1,000 and 1,100 feet. The crew reported on left base leg for Runway 23, was given clearance to land, and was informed that the wind was from 230 degrees at 10 to 15 knots. As it approached the extended centerline of the runway, around 4:42pm, it made a left bank that reached approximately 45 degrees. The aircraft was then observed to recover immediately to level flight and to begin a bank to the right which became progressively steeper. The right bank continued until the aircraft was inverted, at which time the nose dropped and a yaw to the left was observed. The 707 then continued to roll to the right in a nose down configuration. Shortly before impact, the wings leveled one final time. Investigation revealed the aircraft struck the ground in a wings-level attitude, in a nearly stalled condition, yawed to the left approximately 12 degrees, with considerable and nearly symmetrical power. The aircraft crashed in a potato field, a fire erupted on impact, and all five aboard were killed. The crash occurred only a few miles from the Brookhaven National Laboratories, a site of key secret nuclear work. The fire continued to burn for over an hour after the crash, hampering emergency crews in their efforts to remove the bodies of the crew. The Air Force sent several pieces of fire equipment to the scene. Eventually, a large crowd gathered at the crash site as word spread over radio and television newscasts, and people drove from resorts and towns in the area to see the wreckage. The crash followed a series of 707 emergencies, none involving fatalities, in recent weeks involving passenger flights, the first occurring on February 3, 1959, when a Pan Am 707 nose dived over the Atlantic and landed safely in Gander, the same day another American Airlines flight crashed in New York City. The incident with the Pan Am flight was followed by four landing gear breakdowns on jets operated by Pan Am and American Airlines. Cause The probable cause suggested was that \\"the crew failed to recognize and correct the development of excessive yaw which caused an unintentional rolling maneuver at an altitude too low to permit complete recovery.\\" Subsequent to the accident, the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) discontinued the requirement that Boeing 707 aircraft make actual landings with simulated failure of 50 percent of the power units concentrated on one side of the aircraft during training flights, type ratings, and proficiency checks. These maneuvers may now be simulated at an appropriate higher altitude. On February 5, 1960, Boeing issued a service bulletin for an improved rudder modification which adds boost power to the wider ranges of directional movement, and gives increased control capability at low airspeeds and minimum gross weight. This modification also replaces the original rudder with an improved version.

It was first released in early access in late 2012, and officially released on December 18, 2015. An expansion, titled Expedition, was released in July 2019. Gameplay Underrail is a post- apocalyptic, turn based, isometric role-playing game focused on combat and exploration. It features tactical turn-based combat, a vast underground world to explore, extensive character customization possibilities and a detailed item crafting system. Many different playstyles are allowed by the character customization options. The player controls a single character, whose development and interactions with the game world are the focus of the gameplay. The game's ruleset is mainly inspired by the SPECIAL system from the Fallout series. It is a classless system with multiple levels of customization. Base ability scores determine a character's core potential, skills represent a character's linear progression in specific skills and feats can grant new abilities, provide passive bonuses or alter a character's existing abilities. The turn-based combat system is similar to Fallout's with more options added on top of it, such as the use of special abilities, psionics and more combat utilities. The system is intended to provide many combat options and unique playstyles. Plot Setting The game is set in the far future when the Earth's surface has been uninhabitable for a long time and the remaining humans live in the eponymous Underrail metro network, where conflicting factions struggle violently to survive in the harsh underground conditions. The scarcest resources in Underrail are food and living space. There is also a greater background plot concerning the nature of time, but the game is mostly about the inhabitants of Underrail, their politics, strife and the dangers of Underrail itself. Story The player takes on the role of a new member of one of the stations on the fringe of Underrail. The player character starts as a blank slate, allowing the player to develop him or her as preferred. The story is narrated primarily through dialogue with non-player characters inhabiting the world of Underrail. The player is positioned to side with different competing factions in their battle to annex stations. Development Game engine development for Underrail begun in late 2008. The game's custom engine and development tools are built using C#, Microsoft's .NET 4.0 framework and XNA Game Studio 4.0. The game has been in full-time development since late 2009 and it was known as Timelapse Vertigo during its pre-alpha and earlier development stages. Prior to its early access release on Steam, most of the development work including design, programming, writing and graphics excluding character models and title screen, was done by Dejan Radisic. Since its initial demo version release in 2012, updated versions of Underrail were released roughly every three or four months. The game was financed through crowdfunding, with early access sales providing additional funding. Character models and music of the game are created by freelance artists and the game uses royalty-free sound effects purchased from online sound libraries. The first trailer for Underrail was released on March 11, 2013, showcasing alpha version gameplay footage. A second trailer was released on August 6, 2014, showcasing gameplay footage from the game's most recent alpha version update. Release On August 22, 2012, a demo of Underrail was released on IndieDB. On December 6, 2012, an alpha version became available on both Desura and GamersGate digital distribution platforms, and on September 24, 2013, alpha version became available as early access on the Steam store as well. The game was released out of early access on December 18, 2015. An expansion, Underrail: Expedition, was released on July 22, 2019, and features a new plotline based in new locations, alongside other gameplay changes and additions.

History He was born in Quorn, South Australia, where his father James Casey may have been proprietor of the Hotel Austral, then farmed at \\"Amelia Park\\", Peterborough. He was educated at Unley High School. He was chosen the Labor candidate for the seat of Frome in the House of Assembly in November 1960 following the unexpected death of sitting member Mick O'Halloran. Tom was not even a member of the Labor Party, but as a respected local identity was considered to have a better chance of following the idiosyncratic O'Halloran than an outsider from the Union movement.

He was president of the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1889, and the president of the Engineers' Society of Western Pennsylvania in 1893. Biography Max Joseph Becker was born at Coblenz Germany June 20, 1828 and was educated in the schools of Coblenz, and at the University of Bonn. After leaving the University he passed the requisite examinations for admission to service on the Government Railroad surveys and in 1848 began his professional career on the Cologne and Minden Railroad in the capacity of engineer's apprentice (rodman), with headquarters at Hamm in Westphalia. This work was interrupted by the Rebellion of 1848 and by reason of his connection therewith he was compelled to leave Germany along with such men as Frederick Hecker, Carl Schurz, Franz Sigel, August Willich and others whose enforced exile has been our country's gain. After a brief sojourn in Switzerland he came to the United States, landing in New York City in 1850. His first year's residence in this country was a struggle for a foothold, during which he tried various lines of employment, among others, making surveys in Connecticut for a map publishing house, as draftsman in an engraving establishment, and even tried his hand at journalism on the staff of the Abendzeitung. In December 1851 he entered the service of the Steubenville and Indiana Railroad at Steubenville, Ohio under Jacob Blickensderfer Jr, Mem. ASCE, Chief Engineer. His first service with this company was as a draftsman, but this was soon changed to transitman on location and then to Resident Engineer on construction in which capacity he continued until the completion of the road in 1854. From 1854 to 1856 he held no salaried position, doing such professional work as offered and occupying a part of his time in making and publishing a map of Coshocton County, Ohio. In 1856 he entered the service of the State of Ohio as Resident Engineer on the Ohio Canal and continued in that position until 1859. From 1859 to 1861 he was Resident Engineer on the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad, in charge of location and construction. During this time he also rebuilt a suspension bridge over the Scioto River at Portsmouth, Ohio which had been destroyed by the undermining of one tower during a flood. During the presidential campaign of 1860, Becker took a lively interest in the success of the Republican party and made numerous speeches in German in various towns and cities of Southern Ohio where the German element was strong. In appreciation of this Abraham Lincoln commissioned him Postmaster at Portsmouth, Ohio. But the drudgery and the red tape methods of that office were not suited to his taste and in 1862 he resigned the office and again took service under his former chief Jacob Blickensderfer Jr., at that time Chief Engineer of the Pittsburgh and Steubenville Railroad. Becker was placed in charge of construction of the Steubenville Bridge and its approaches, one of the most important structures crossing the Ohio River and subsequently rebuilt by him. In 1863 he again went to the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad to take charge of the location and construction of its extension from Loveland, Ohio to Cincinnati. His connection with this railroad company continued until 1867 when he became Chief Engineer of the Steubenville and Indiana Railroad, which position he continued to fill in the various companies formed by its consolidation with other roads until he at length had charge of the entire system of the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad. For nearly thirty years he not only discharged the responsible duties entrusted to him with rare fidelity and ability but won the confidence and affection of his associates. To the professional acquirements which made his judgment of such pronounced value he brought a long experience a well balanced mind and a fund of sound common sense which were of the greatest service in the solution of the many important problems that confronted him from time to time in his railway career. In January 1893 the Board of Directors sought to make his declining years easier and to that end relieved him of some of his duties and changed his title to \\"Consulting Engineer and Real Estate Agent.\\" But the disease which finally carried him off had even then laid its hand upon him and he was not permitted to enjoy the rest from labor contemplated by this act. After a brave fight marked by his usual cheerful serenity, he succumbed on August 23, 1896 and the world lost a gallant honest gentleman who had reflected credit upon his profession and who left a name without a shadow of stain or reproach. The above record is sufficient to show the power and character of the man who coming to this country a political refugee almost unknown and nearly penniless at once went to work ardently at whatever his hand could find to do to make his own living and to be dependent upon no one. In social moments when led to speak of his early struggles his account was of great interest he threw into it a strain of humor which would have made it laughable if it had not been really pathetic. No attempt of ours to repeat his tale could do it justice because it would be impossible to reproduce his inimitable style it is sufficient to say that his marked success and steady rise from obscurity to the highest plane of his profession where he found himself at home should be an enduring encouragement to all struggling young men who may sometimes under pressure of a hard fight get the mistaken notion into their heads that the world is against them. Becker's professional and personal standing among engineers was of the highest; he was an honored and beloved member of the Engineers' Society of Western Pennsylvania; he was a member of its Board of Direction for many years, President for 1893, and most useful in every way. Becker was elected a Member of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) on August 7, 1872 and was made its President in 1889. At the time of his election his personal acquaintance in the Society was not very large and some questions were asked; before his term had expired he had won all hearts, as he always did wherever he came into touch with people. Becker was more than an able engineer, he was a man of force a gentleman genial and witty kind and sympathetic, always ready to lend a helping hand. A man without malice or guile he had no time for animosities and his memory will ever remain in the minds of all who knew him. It must also be remembered that, while president in 1889, Max Becker served on the ASCE committee to examine the cause of the Johnstown, PA disaster. The breach of the South Fork Dam had killed over 2,200 people, most of whom were women and children. The other three engineers on the committee included the well-known hydraulic engineers James B. Francis, William Ezra Worthen, and Alphonse Fteley. Although the report was completed by January 1890, it was immediately suppressed and not released to other ASCE members or the public until mid-1891, two years after the 1889 flood. James Francis presented the results of the investigation at the ASCE convention in Chattanooga, TN. The other three committee members did not attend this long- awaited report. Although Francis‚Äô name headed the report, the de facto chairman of the committee was Becker, who had virtually no experience in dams or hydraulic engineering. According to James Francis, it was Becker who delayed the release of the report. The new ASCE president in 1890, William Shinn, had placed it in the hands of Becker to decide when to release it. Shinn was a close business associate of Andrew Carnegie, who had been a member of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club. That club had owned the failed South Fork dam. A detailed discussion of the South Fork investigation, the participating engineers, and the science behind the 1889 flood was published in 2018.

Serling. The book was made into a made-for-TV film by the same name, which aired on 23 October 1973 in the United States. The book tells the story of a crash of Air Force One in remote terrain and the uncertainty stemming from the lack of confirmation whether the president of the United States is alive or dead. The vice president, an unpopular figure, pressures the cabinet to declare him acting president under the terms of the 25th Amendment so he can address a growing crisis with China with a pre-emptive nuclear strike. The President's Plane Is Missing spent multiple weeks on the New York Times Bestseller List and its success enabled Serling to become a full-time writer. Serling later penned a sequel to the novel entitled Air Force One Is Haunted, in which the ghost of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt haunts the incumbent president whenever he boards Air Force One. Synopsis Air Force One crashes in a storm in a remote area and the badly-burned and scattered bodies cannot be definitively identified, making it impossible to confirm that President Jeremy Haines has been killed, which would allow his vice president, Fred Madigan, to automatically assume the presidency. In this uncertainty, and amid a growing crisis with China that threatens to lead to war, Madigan (a weak character, pushed along by his ambitious wife) contemplates invoking Article Three the 25th Amendment to become acting president, though he needs majority support from the cabinet to do so. He was not privy to Haines's plans, and receives contradictory advice from the national security advisor (who claims Haines was ready to declare war) and the secretary of state (who insists Haines was planning a more peaceful way of containing the threat). The cabinet is split on the issue and tensions increase when Madigan declares that once acting president, he will launch a pre-emptive strike on China. The novel's climax is the sudden appearance of Haines, alive and well. He'd never been on Air Force One (and had sent a look-alike to board the plane in his place), but instead had secretly traveled to Camp David for highly-sensitive treaty negotiations with the leader of the Soviet Union to contain China. Only the secretary of state knew of the plan but had been sworn to secrecy lest the treaty negotiation fail. Film In 1973 a film adaptation of the book was aired on television, starring Peter Graves and Buddy Ebsen. Filming for The President's Plane Is Missing had been completed in 1971, but Graves reported that the film did not air until 1973 due to the film's villains being Chinese and President Richard Nixon's then negotiations with China.
