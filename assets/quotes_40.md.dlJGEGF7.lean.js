Sollenberger, in the persona of PFT Commenter, is a sportswriter who covers the National Football League and US politics for online publication Barstool Sports. He has previously been published on other sports sites including Kissing Suzy Kolber, SBNation, Football Savages, as well as his own site, StrongTakes.com. PFT Commenter, whose name references Profootballtalk.com, mimics the \\"macho posturing and racism,\\" or \\"hot takes,\\" in the website's comment sections. PFT Commenter is currently the co-host of the Barstool Sports podcast, Pardon My Take. Style His writing style is characterized by \\"didactic misspelling, erratic punctuation, barely veiled racism, not- quite-latent homophobia, conspiratorial anxiety, and arrogant disdain for critical thought\\" and the character is \\"dumb on purpose\\", earning a comparison to the Stephen Colbert character on The Colbert Report with his ability to \\"undermine the league‚Äôs resident apologists and party-liners.\\" PFT Commenter often overpraises white players for their blue-collar attitudes, criticizes black players for being selfish and overrated, and ‚Äúeagerly takes the NFL party line on every possible issue‚Äù. In response to criticisms of his poor spelling, he wrote, \\"Im on record that I dont care about spelling, I care about TELLING.\\" Persona and media appearances Sollenberger began to use the PFT Commenter alias as a commenter on ProFootballTalk.com before starting the @PFTCommenter Twitter account in 2012 and eventually becoming a contributor for SBNation, Kissing Suzy Kolber and Football Savages. In September 2015, PFT Commenter made an appearance on Mike Florio's PFT Live radio program. Also in 2015, PFT Commenter began commenting on the 2016 United States presidential election and appeared on camera several times, albeit in the background, during the television coverage of the Republican Party presidential debates. PFT Commenter also asked then-Presidential candidate Ben Carson if he would travel back in time to abort an unborn Adolf Hitler, an exchange covered by the national media, leading to the headline, \\"Ben Carson would not abort Baby Hitler.\\" on CNN.com PFT Commenter moved to Barstool Sports in March 2016 and started the podcast Pardon My Take along with co-host Dan Katz. The podcast, which is often satirical in nature, has grown to a top ranking on iTunes' \\"Sports and Recreation\\" list. In May 2016, PFT Commenter accompanied three other co-workers on a so-called \\"Grit Week,\\" starting in Buffalo and ending in Indianapolis for the Indianapolis 500. He and Katz also made an appearance on SportsCenter with Scott Van Pelt on February 8, 2017. Despite the National Football League removing press credentials for Barstool Sports, PFT sneaked into \\"Opening Night\\" for Super Bowl LI in Houston and was able to ask questions to players and coaches. PFT Commenter makes regular call-in appearances on Bomani Jones' ESPN radio show The Right Time. In January 2020, in advance of the XFL's 2020 revival season, PFT Commenter tried-out as a placekicker for the XFL's DC Defenders, after being trained by Jeff Fisher and Morten Andersen, in response to former NFL wide receiver Chad Johnson announcing that he was trying out for the XFL as a kicker (before quickly cancelling).https://www.barstoolsports.com/video/1653455/i-am- seriously-trying-out-today-for-the-xfl-with-the-assistance-of-hofer-morten- andersen-and-jeff-fisher During his tryout, PFT Commenter's signature sunglasses were replaced tinted goggles and his helmet bore a single bar face mask, which has long been disallowed for use in professional and college football. He was ultimately not selected by the Defenders, as Tyler Rausa (who was at the same tryout) won the kicking position.https://www.barstoolsports.com/video/1709490/hard-knocks-xfl-my- tryout-for-the-d-c-defenders Identity Despite his popularity, PFT has not publicly revealed his identity. He told Awful Announcing in 2017 that he wore sunglasses on camera to avoid identification and the staff at Barstool Sports referred to him as \\"PFT\\", as only half knew his real name. He said that his identity had become an \\"open secret\\" and that it would be found out eventually. In May 2018, an article by Deadspin revealed that PFT Commenter was played by Eric Sollenberger. Publishing As PFT Commenter, Sollenberger wrote the self-published e-book, Goodell vs. Obama: The Battle for the Future of the NFL, which imagines a dystopian future in which President Barack Obama attempts to turn the Dallas Cowboys into a soccer team in Kenya, and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell fights him in a boxing match to stop him.

It is located at Bosa Gaon, Golaghat, Assam. It is located at the place where the rivers Ghiladhari, Matrang and Kakodonga meet. The name comes from the eight kuris nearby it, this forms the word athkuriya, which later on became athkheliya. Ahom king Gada Pani constructed it in the year 1681 AD. Before the year 1970, it was officially called Sri Sri Athkheliya 'Hori Mandir' (Vishnu temple), but later on, it became Sri Sri Athkheliya Namghar due to the influence of Vaishnavism. Tens of thousands of devotees visit the place, especially in the month of Bhado or Bhadra (August to September). Pratahpraxanga, madhyahnapraxanga, biyoli praxanga etc. are regularly carried out. Some important festivals held are Borxowah, panitola xowah, namlowa xowah, no-saul xowah, rax mahotsav, boroxa bhauna etc. Etymology Sri Sri Athkheliya is named after the eight kuris or \\"neighbourhoods\\" or \\"parts\\". As the people of these eight kuris together have formed a society and have carried out religious works together there, it got the name Sri Sri Athkhelia Namghar. According to Axom buronji or \\"history of Assam\\", the Ahom kings, leaving those who knew systematic farming, to do expansion based farming, started the paiksystem. The groups above the paiks were called khels. Some such royal persons, or post-holders settled in some neighbourhoods, the name of the khels were decided upon the 'post' of that post-holder. Before 1970, Sri Sri Athkheliya Namghar was known as Sri Sri Athkhelia Hori Mandir. Even now on the entrance, inscription says Sri Sri Athkheliya Hori Mandir. After 1970, it was renamed as Sri Sri Athkheliya Namghar. History The definite answer to when and how the Sri Sri Athkhelia Namghar was made is unknown. According to Edward Gait's 'History of Assam', Kachari kingdom's extent was from river Kalang to river Dikhou.History Of Assam by E A Gait ‡¶™‡ßÉ‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶†‡¶æ: ‡ß®‡ß™‡ßÆ-‡ß®‡ß™‡ßØ In the year 1600, the area went under the Kacharis. So, according to that, some Kachari king established a hori mandir or Shiva temple at that place to worship. In the buronji too, foundation of any namghar at that place is not mentioned, also, Gadapani didn't like Vaishnavism much. Perhaps due to some natural calamity, the temple got destructed. And the place turned into a forest. Some holy sage worshipped and reappeared the temple. As people got attracted, worship started again. Also, an idol of Shiva has been found in a tea garden, about 5 to 7 km away. According to experts, it was made in the 9th century, i.e. before the arrival of the Ahoms.‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶Æ‡ßÉ‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶ó‡ßç‡ß∞‡¶®‡ßç‡¶•; ‡¶¨‡ß∞‡¶π‡ßã‡¶≤‡¶æ ‡¶â‡¶ö‡ßç‡¶ö‡¶§‡ß∞ ‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶ß‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶Æ‡¶ø‡¶ï ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶≤‡¶Ø‡¶º ‡¶∏‡ßã‡¶£‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßÄ ‡¶ú‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§‡ßÄ According to tales, land of the Sri Sri Athkhelia Namghar was once an Ashram of some unknown kulasheel sage. At those times, the place was full of trees, wild animals and transportation was a big problem. After Swargadeo Loraroja, illegally became the king, Gadapani Kowar or Godadhor Xingho, in disguise roamed at the hills. Once he saw the ashram and stayed there for a few days. It is said that the soldiers of loraroja, in search of Gadapani reached there, but as there were trees and trees, and the path was full of spider-webs, they didn't expect to find any human there and went back. When Gadapani came out, he saw the footprints and came to know that the soldiers came searching him. The sage once told Gadapani, that he will become the king. Gadapani too, promised that if that happens, he will make the sage his minister. Time passed, in 1681 AD, Gadapani became the king. Gadapani sent his men to search for the sage, so that he fulfills his promise. But nobody ever found the sage again. No one knows what happened to the sage. But, Gadapani gave the duty to eight paik families nearby the ashram to take care of the place. As time passed by, the families turned into kuris, and as the eight kuris were associated with the holy place, the name became Athkuriya and later on Athkheliya. With time, that mandir or temple turned into a namghar, due to the influence of Vaishnavism. Now, it is a prominent pilgrimage centre of Vaishnavs all over India. Location Sri Sri Athkheliya Namghar is located at Bosa Gaon, Ghiladhari, Golaghat, Assam. The place is about 18 km away from Golaghat city. Starting their journey from the Naga hills, the three rivers join at a place very nearby Sri Sri Athkheliya Namghar. The Matrang river meets northward flowing Ghiladhari river and finally both join the Kakodonga river nearby. Transportation ;Airway Jorhat Airport lies about 60 km away from the centre. ;Railway The Forkating railway station is about 12.8 km away from the centre. ;Road Golaghat is well connected by roads from all parts of Assam. Golaghat city is about 20 km away from the centre and it takes about 40 minutes by bus to reach Sri Sri Athkhelia namghar from Golaghat city.

He worked for many years in Dublin, Ireland. He was a key witness in the Cloncurry adultery case in 1807, where he gave compelling evidence of Lady Cloncurry's affair with Sir John Piers. History Gabrielli was recruited to work in Ireland by Baron Cloncurry in 1805 to decorate the family's country house, now titled Lyons Demesne in County Kildare. The Baron also imported shiploads of classical treasures from Italy. Gabrielli's stay at Lyons was not without romance or controversy. The romance was that Gabrielli married Lady Cloncurry's maid; the controversy was that he was called as a witness in a highly publicized adultery trial in 1807 by Baron Valentine Cloncurry against Sir John Bennett Piers, 6th Baronet, for having carried an affair with Lady Georgiana Cloncurry in full view of Gabrielli as he worked on his frescoes. The painted decorations in the house are \\"The Bay of Dublin\\" (dining-room) and \\"Views of Herculaneum\\" in panels in the small drawing-room. Gabrielli also frescoed at Tandragee Castle for the Duke of Manchester, and in the drawing-room of No. 41 North Great George's Street. In Cromwell's \\"Excursions through Ireland,\\" published in 1820, are two plates from drawings by Gabrielli: \\"Carlow Castle\\" and \\"Drimnagh Castle\\". In Dublin, Gabrielli was active as a landscape painter, participating in various exhibitions between 1809 and 1814, and serving as Vice-President of the Society of Artists of Ireland in 1811.

Oko Jr. was in 1948 the captain of the S.S. Kefalos, one of the first ships to smuggle arms to Israel during the War of Independence and, subsequently, an important vessel that rescued slightly over 7,700 Jewish refugees from the Balkans and transported them to Israel in two voyages the same year. Early life and education Oko was born December 12, 1904, in New York to Adolph Sigmund Oko who became a celebrated biographer and Spinoza scholar associated with Hebrew Union College and Rose Susan Weisinger, an unmarried couple. The younger Oko grew up spending time with his father's and his mother's families in Cincinnati and Northern California. In the late 1910s, Oko attended the Cincinnati Academy of Art. Adept at drawing, Oko maintained a lifelong interest in fine art and antiquities, a fact that served him well when he worked in San Francisco as a salesman at S & G Gump in the 1920s, and in later years as well. Family life In 1926, Oko married (Doris) Madge Reniff. In 1927, a son also named Adolph S. Oko, III was born. The marriage, an unhappy one, ended in divorce undertaken in 1933 and finalized in 1934. In 1933 or 1934, Oko married Gladys Zemple. Early career At age 18, Oko went to sea, serving on at least eleven ships. During the Depression, Oko held a number of disparate jobs. In 1937, Oko's finances forced him into bankruptcy. In the ensuing years, Oko ran a public relations firm. In 1942, Oko joined the US Merchant Marine, serving on six ships on nine voyages, ending as a chief mate. On his last voyage, Oko and shipmates made a trip to the Great Wall of China where Oko was shot and captured by the Communists, and held briefly. In December 1945, Oko and business partners purchased the S.S. Amur. In 1947, Oko and partners purchased the ex-USS Aries, then called the S. S. Adelanto with the intent of sailing the ship to Israel. When a plan to smuggle half-tracks from South America to Palestine fell through, the ship was put up for sale. Kefalos early history The T/S Dicto was built in 1917 by Bethlehem Steel Company in San Francisco. Sold in 1929, the cargo's turbine was replaced by a triple-expansion steam engine. A sale in 1933 saw the name of the ship changed to S. S. American Cardinal. A 1936 sale resulted in the name S. S. Mallard. The ship was requisitioned by the US government in 1941 and renamed the S. S. Larranga (sometimes seen as Larra≈àaga). After service in World War II, the ship was placed in the reserve fleet. In 1947, Michael P. Bonicos, a Greek immigrant, purchased the ship and named it Kefalos. Under his ownership, the cargo made a number of trips to Montevideo and to England. During these voyages, Bonicos and his brother Gerassimos, the vessel's captain, maximized profits by underpaying crews and severely neglecting the ship's conditions. Voyage to Israel In 1948, Haganah, the main Jewish underground in Palestine, through two chief intermediaries, Elie Shalit and Rafael Recanati, in a series of complex transactions, purchased the Kefalos from its owners. Oko traveled to Portland, Maine, where the vessel had arrived from its last trip from England, to captain the Kefalos. Finding the ship in very poor condition, he had basic repairs made. Oko brought his wife aboard as purser and nurse. Key crew members came from the Adelanto; many of whom were Spanish Republican refugees, including key officers of the Kefalos. (An admirer of the Spanish Republic, Oko showed a marked preference for hiring Spanish exiled Republican sailors. Their loyalty to Oko proved an important element in the vessel's eventual successful missions.) The ship was taken to New York where the Todd Shipyard conducted extensive and expensive repairs. Sailing from New York, the ship traveled to Tampico, Mexico. There, a cargo of machine guns from Hawaii via Los Angeles (where most were confiscated by U. S. authorities) and arms secured in Mexico City were loaded on the Kefalos. A cargo of sugar covered the arms. On August 3, 1948, the shipped sailed from Tampico for Tel Aviv. En route, the ship changed its name to the S.S. M.A. Pinzon and wood structures were built to make the ship appear more like the actual M/V Pinzon. The ship was known as the Dromit in internal Israeli communications. The ship survived several dangers en route, but managed to arrive at Tel Aviv on September 8, 1948. During the day, 1,020 tons of sugar were slowly unloaded. At night, 784 tons of arms were expeditiously unloaded.The 784 tons of armament and RADAR equipment were reported as 32 75-mm cannon with 16,000 shells, 2 75-mm cannon with 4,000 shells, 170 50-kg air bombs, 500 6-Browning machine guns with 10 million bullets, 4 sets of RADAR, 60 heavy Vickers machine guns, 24 heavy American machine guns, 15,000 steel helmets and high-octane aviation fuel. The Kefalos sailed from Israel on September 12, 1948. Rescue missions The Kefalos traveled to Naples where modifications to carry passengers in near- slave-ship conditions took much of September and October, 1948. On November 8, 1948, the Kefalos left Naples headed to Bakar where 4,300 refugees from eastern Europe had arrived in boxcars. Five marriages and three births were recorded among the passengers. There were no deaths or serious injuries among the passengers. On November 23, the ship arrived in Haifa. Oko also captained a second refugee trip in which 3,800 refugees were safely delivered to Haifa. The Kefalos arrived at Bakar on December 8, 1948, but had to wait until December 15 for all the refugees to arrive. The ship arrived in Haifa on December 25.While 4,300 plus 3,800 is 8,100, other records indicate that 7,737 refugees were rescued. The exact numbers may never be known. Ship's final days Apparently, fallout from Oko's concerns at Naples and in the refugee operations led to his dismissal by Israeli officials on January 5, 1949. The ship entered the Israeli merchant fleet and was renamed Dromit. It was retired from service on March 6, 1962, and was scrapped in 1963. Later life Oko resided in Point Reyes Station, CaliforniaOko identified the location as the \\"Inverness ‚Äì Pt. Reyes Wye\\" referring to the old railroad location. where he conducted a real estate business. Oko was president of the Drake Navigators Guild and promoted research on Drake's landing in California. Oko almost single-handedly rehabilitated the Inverness Yacht Club. Death Oko died in 1963 of a heart attack at the age 58. Gladys Oko remarried and moved to Massachusetts where she, too, died of a heart attack in 1977.

The genus contains twelve species described from sites in England, Eastern Europe and Far Eastern Russia.  Distribution  Emplastus is known from a number of adult fossil specimens which are composed of partial adult males, female workers and queens. The first specimens described were preserved as compression fossils in sedimentary rock from the Radoboj area of what is now Croatia. The deposits are the result of sedimentation in an inland sea basin, possibly a shallow lagoon environment, during the Burdigalian of the Early Miocene. Along with the Emplastus species, a diverse assemblage of several hundred species of insects have been preserved in the sediments, along with fish and algae. The fossil impressions are preserved in micrite limestones, resulting in low quality preservation of fine details. Another series of species were described from compression fossils found in thin layers and concretions of micrite from the \\"insect bed\\" and older stratum of the Bembridge Marls. The marls are exposed at a number of locations along the north coast of the Isle of Wight in England. Part of the Bouldnor Formation, the marls have been dated to the Late Eocene in age. The marls have not preserved any Symphyta hymenopterans such as Tenthredinoidea species, suggesting that the paleotemperature of the marls was as warm or possibly warmer than either the Baltic amber or Florissant Formation forests, while the presence of the wasp family Scelionidae suggests generally mesic moisture conditions. Since the genus and first species descriptions, another series of species have been described from fossils found in Russia. The three species were described from compression fossils preserved in diatomite deposits of the Bol‚Äôshaya Svetlovodnaya site. Located in the Pozharsky District, on the Pacific Coast of Russia, the fossil bearing rocks preserve possibly Priabonian plants and animals which lived in a small lake near a volcano. The site has been attributed to either the Maksimovka or Salibez Formations and compared to the Bembridge Marls and Florissant Formation, both of which are Priabonian in age.  History and classification  E. gurnetensis holotype In 1849, some ant fossils from Radoboj were studied by Oswald Heer, then a professor with the University of Z√ºrich. He placed the single species he described in the living genus Formica as Formica ocella and in the same paper, a single male was described as Formica ocella var. paulo major based the large size of the abdomen. The species was retained in Formica by Gustav Mayr in 1867 and Anton Handlirsch in 1907. Mayr named two species Liometopum antiquum and Hypoclinea haueri in an 1867 publication on the ant fossils of Radoboj. The species Hypoclinea haueri was moved in 1893 by Karl Wilhelm von Dalla Torre from Hypoclinea to the combination Iridomyrmex haueri, a placement that was not changed until 2014. The species and many of the type specimens were reexamined and redescribed in 2014 by paleoentomologists Gennady Dlussky and Tatyana Putyatina. When Dlussky, Rasnitsyn, and Perfilieva described the species E. biamoensis, they gave it the name E. dubious, but that name had already been used the year prior for a species from Radoboj. As such Perfilieva and Rasnitsyn proposed the replacement name E. biamoensis in a 2015 paper. They derived the name from \\"Biamo\\", the older name of the type locality at Bol‚Äôshaya Svetlovodnaya. A number of E. britannicus fossils are known and were described under three different names. The oldest descriptions are that of Theodore Cockerell who named both Dolichoderus britannicus and Dolichoderus ovigerus, citing small wing differences tentatively separating the two species. A third species, Emplastus emeryi, was named by Horace Donisthorpe in 1920, and was the type species of the genus Emplastus. In the time since the initial descriptions of the species, a number of additional queens and several males have been found, and a group of over twenty body fossils plus twenty seven wing fossils were studied by Dlussky and Perfilieva and published in 2014. The fossils showed a spectrum of wing morphology that bridged all three species, and as such they deemed both D. ovigerus and E. emeryi to be synonyms of the first published species name D. britannicus. However the propodeum is different than that of Dolichoderus species, being rounded in profile, and as such the species was retained in the genus Emplastus. A second Emplastus species was described by Cockerell from the Bembridge Marls as Ponera hypolitha. It was moved in 1964 to the fossil genus Poneropsis, and finally to Emplastus in 2014.  Description  Species in Emplastus are not preserved well enough to place in formal genera, but a suite of characteristics is found in all the species which comprise the morphogenus. All the species have a similar size range, considered medium for ant species. The fossils have generally rectangular heads bearing triangular toothed mandibles and rounded occipital corners. In profile, the propodeum has a round upper surface and the gaster is smooth, with no constriction between the first and second segments. In gynes the petioles are enlarged, while in males, the outline is triangular. In the forewings there are 4 well formed cells enclosed by the veins, 1+2r, 3r, rm and mcu. The 3r cell has an elongated outline that extends to the upper wing margin. Of the wing veins, the 1RS runs perpendicular or slightly angled to the R vein. E. antiquus The neotype fossil is a long gyne preserved as a partial dorsal impression. This species is distinguished by the distinct but weakly concave ocular margin at the rear of the head. All other Emplastus species from Radoboj have slightly convex margins. While E. britannicus also has a concave rear to the head capsule, it is a larger species than E. antiquus and the antenna scape of E. britannicus is much shorter. Due to the poor wing preservation the species was moved from Liometopum, though the preserved areas have a vein structure indicating relation to genera of the subfamily Dolichoderinae. E. biamoensis The single known queen of E. biamoensis is the only Emplastus gyne described from Bol‚Äôshaya Svetlovodnaya. Overall the species has a body length of The queen is distinct from the other Bol‚Äôshaya Svetlovodnaya species due to the forward set smallish eyes, whereas the two other species have large eyes. The species is smaller than the queens from the Bembridge Marls and Radoboj which range between . The petiole is smaller than that of E. britannicus and E. gurnetensis. E. britannicus E. britannicus (\\"E. emeryi\\" holotype) Females of E. britannicus range between with a forewing length between . The head is broader than it is long, giving a rectangular outline, and like E. antiquus of Radoboj it has a convex curve to the rear head margin. While Emery in his description asserted the mandibles to have a smooth margin, further specimens have shown that the robust mandibles have several blunt teeth on the chewing margin. The legs are usually short and thick. The petiole flared in width being up to three times as wide across as it is from front to back. The gaster is typically oval in outline. Males are smaller, at only approximately in length for the few described specimens. They have a small head, with similar mandibles to the females, and likewise similar short antenna scapes. Unlike the females, the legs of the males are long and fairly thin. The species names britannicus and ovigerus were not given etymologies by Cockerell, while the name emeryi was coined by Donisthorpe as a patronym honoring the Italian entomologist Carlo Emery, who gave input Donisthorpe on the Isle of Wight fossils, and for his work on Sicilian amber ants. Overall individuals of E. britannicus are the most numerous ant fossils in the Bembridge Marls. E. dubius The E. dubius holoype The E. dubius queen is separated from the other species due to the distinct structure of the forewing cells. The wings have a triangular RM cell, while other species have a rectangular RM cell. Also the RM cell has a peduncle, while the RM cell of other species do not. The head is just slightly rectangular, being a little longer than wide. Similarly, the mesosoma is nearly one-and-a-half times longer than its height. The gaster, however, is an oval shape in outline. Dlussky and Putyatina coined the species name from the Latin \\"dubius\\", meaning uncertain. The queen was originally identified by Heer as a specimen of Formica globularus. E. elongatus The solitary male specimen of E. elongatus is , preserved in profile, and with the head twisted so the upper area of the head capsule is showing. The front edge of the clypeus is slightly rounded, unlike that of E. macrops. The angle of the head shows large developed ocelli, but the antennae are not preserved. The compound eyes are large as in E. macrops. The two species are separated by the longer mesosoma of E. elongatus, which also has a more rounded scutum. E. gurnetensis E. gurnetensis queen The head of the E. gurnetensis is longer than wide, with slightly convex sides and an occipital margin that may be straight or poorly convex. The propodeum is smoothly rounded in profile, and the legs are short and thick. The males are smaller than the queens, with an average body length of . The heads have large, visible ocelli, while the petiole is slightly higher than long with a triangular outline. Both the scutum and scutellum have convex upper surfaces, and the legs are long and thin. While E. gurnetensis is very similar to both E. britannicus and E. hypolithus in several respects, there are notable differences. The female size is smaller, at , than the male E. hypolithus, indicating they are separate species. In the case of E. britannicus, there are features of both the head and petiole structures that indicate they are distinct. E. haueri The single queen of this species was described by Mayr in 1867. The description provided in the type paper indicated a body length of about and with forewings nearly as long at . The slightly rounded mesosoma is distinct from all the other species being notably long. Since the holotype specimen could not be located for restudy and the one possible male of the species is not well preserved, the species was transferred from Iridomyrmex to Emplastus by Dlussky and Putyatina. E. hypolithus E. hypolithus wing The species was redescribed from fourteen isolated wings and a single long male in 2014. The species is distinguishable by the notably narrow rm cell of the forewing, which mostly takes a triangular shape, but sometimes is quadrangular. The mid-sized cmu cell is trapezoidal and the rs-m cross-vein is usually placed on the wing tip side of the 2r-rs vein. The male has a small head with compound eyes located anterior to the head's midpoint. The scutellum is weakly rounded and about half the length of the mesosoma. E. kozlovi This Bembridge Marls species was described from a set of five solitary wings from males and females. The female forewings have lengths ranging between while the smaller male wings are generally . The vein structure is similar to that of E. britannicus though the wing size of the latter is smaller. E. kozlovi also differs in the proportioning of the triangular rm cell, which is longer than in E. britannicus. One of the paratype wings had initially been identified by Donisthorpe as a wing of E. britannicus, and was not re-identified until the description of E. kozlovi in 2014. Dlussky and Perfilieva named the species after the finder of the holotype fossil, Mikhail Kozlov. E. macrops E. macrops was described from a single male preserved in profile. The fossil lacks portions of the antennae, wings, legs, and gaster, resulting in placement of the species into Emplastus. The male has a short antenna scape that does not extend past the head capsule margin. The clypeus has a straight front edge bordering the triangular mandibles. E. macrops is distinguished from the other species in the genus based on the notably large compound eyes that are oval in outline and cover most of the side of the head. The species name is Latin, meaning, \\"with large eyes\\". E. miocenicus E. miocenicus paratype queen Dlussky and Putyatina described this species from a pair of fossils that had been identified as other species. The holotype queen was originally identified by Heer as Ponera fuliginosa, while the paratype queen was identified by Heer as Formica ungeri. While the queens are similar in appearance to E. haueri, both are double in body length of that species, being long. The queens have heads that are nearly square, compound eyes placed near the midpoint, and a clypeus that is curved on the front margin. E. (?) ocellus E.(?) ocellus male The species was first described by Heer as Formica ocella from a pair of queens and males that he thought to be mating when entombed in the lake bottom, in addition to an additional solitary male. The type queen has a body length of , while the males range between . The head capsule is rectangular in outline with straight sides and a concave outline to the rear margin. The front edge of the clypeus is straight, bordering the mandibles which have a curving shape. The unique features of the head are distinct to the species, but preservation is poor enough that placement into a new genus or existing genus is problematic.

It can be reached by Washington State Route 21 on the American side and British Columbia Highway 41 on the Canadian side. This border station, built in 1988, was among the first joint US-Canada border stations, with each agency occupying a portion of a single building. History Original US Border Inspection Station at Danville, WA as seen in 1937 The US has maintained a Customs office in this area since the late 19th Century, initially as a small office several miles from the border. Canada established its customs operations in 1902. Initially, the focus of border inspections was on rail traffic on the east side of the Kettle River. In the late 1930s, border stations were established on the western shores of river where the primary roadway crossed the border. The town of Danville was initially named Nelson due to a store operated directly on the Canada‚ÄìUS border by the Nelson brothers. When the Great Northern Railway ran tracks across the border at this location in 1901, it convinced the town to change its name to Danville to avoid confusion with Nelson, British Columbia. US Customs officials eventually forced the Nelson brothers to close the store due to its effectiveness in evading the payment of duty. The US built a brick inspection station at the border in the 1930s. Canada did not establish a Customs office at Carson until 1950. These facilities were demolished once the joint US-Canada border inspection station was completed in 1988.

Plot Small-town church organist Marion Cullen (Loretta Young) falls in love with traveling salesman Jimmy Decker (David Manners). When she learns that the couple who raised her are not really her parents, and that she is actually the illegitimate daughter of a showgirl, she sets out for New York City in search of Jimmy. However, she discovers that he is engaged to Enid Hollister (Helen Vinson), his boss' daughter. Dr. Travers (George Brent), who is in love with Marion, offers to help her, but she decides to try to make it on her own. Jobs are scarce, however. She ends up with other hopeful showgirls, among them Dixie Dare (Una Merkel), hoping to audition for a part in Ford Humphries' new production. The philandering Humphries likes what he sees in Marion and hires her as a piano accompanist. Dixie gets a job as well, and she and Marion become friends and roommates. Travers sees Humphries and Marion together, and knowing the former's reputation, brings Jimmy to Humphries' party. Jimmy tells Marion that he loves her, but she refuses to break up his marriage. When she also refuses Humphries' advances, he fires her. He then decides to use one of the songs she had composed for his production, claiming he wrote it. When she learns of this, she confronts him, although he denies everything. Jimmy goes to Humphries' suite to convince him to do the right thing. During their argument, Humphries stumbles and falls onto the balcony below and lapses into a coma from his injuries. Jimmy flees the scene; however, the police have a description of him and suspect him of attempted murder. To shield Jimmy, Marion confesses to the non-existent crime. Desperate, Travers operates for hours on Humphries, who regains consciousness and explains what really happened in front of witnesses before dying. Marion is released and becomes engaged to Travers, as Jimmy wishes them well.

The project is focused on bringing back the native birdsong to the area which has been lost due to predation by invasive species introduce when Europeans arrived. Involved in the project is the 5 education institutes in Te Anau which includes Fiordland College, Te Anau primary school, Maraoa Primary School, Fiordland Kindergarten and Southern Stars Early Childhood Centre. The project is run in partnership between the education institutes, Fiordland Conservation Trust, DOC and Kids Restore New Zealand who are the primary sponsor of the project. Operations The project uses kill traps to kill he pests in the area. These traps are targeting Stoats and Rats. There are over 500 traps in the 3000ha area managed by the project spread out along a network of tramlines. The traps were built by a business studies group at Fiordland College in order to gain the capital for their business project. The traps were then distributed throughout the network of trap lines in the Kepler area largely by the community. Now the traps are checked every 6 weeks, with some trap lines being 'operated' by community groups. Poison bait stations have been used in the project in order to manage possum numbers. There is also a trial of the new self resetting trap A24 in the Kepler area. History The project was initially conceived under the name of the backyard bird song project, which failed to receive funding from DOC. The Fiordland Conservation Trust then picked up the project and down scaled the project from a 15,000Ha project to a 3-stage project, stage 1 of which is the Kids Restore the Kepler project. The Fiordland Conservation Trust gained funding from Kids Restore New Zealand which went towards the set up costs of the project. The funding for the project has since been renewed.

The company manufactures a range of pipe tobaccos, rolling tobaccos and smokeless tobaccos in their factory in Svendborg. The company was established in 1887, when founder Harald Halberg purchased Svend B√∏nnelycke's tobacco spinning mill and continued as a modern tobacco factory under the name Harald Halberg Tobaks- og Cigarfabrik. (Harald Halberg Cigar- and Tobacco factories) The company was renamed the Mac Baren Tobacco Company in 1995, as the company had become synonymous with its successful Mac Baren line of pipe tobaccos. History The company traces its history back to 1826 when Svend B√∏nnelycke (1800-1876) established a tobacco factory in Svendborg. It was in 1887 acquired by Harald Halberg (1850' 1919) and later taken over by his son Einar Halberg (born 1881) and grandson J√∏rgen Halberg (born 1915). Products A tin of Mac Baren tobacco The company's most popular line of tobaccos is currently its Mixture line of pipe tobaccos, introduced in 1958. Mac Baren's Choice series is a line of mild aromatic pipe and flavoured hand-rolling tobaccos aimed at a younger audience. In 2010, Mac Baren introduced 7 Seas, a line of American-style aromatic pipe tobaccos broadly similar to, and intended to compete with, STG's Captain Black. In 2013, Mac Baren agreed to purchase Sutliff Tobacco, the Pipe Tobacco Division of Altadis USA, immediately renaming the company back to its original name of Sutliff Tobacco Company. Sutliff was thereafter appointed distributor of all Mac Baren products sold in the United States.

The ground level of the houses built serve as commercial spaces while the upper floors serve as residential spaces. One of which was the Don Lorenzo del Rosario House, owned by Don Lorenzo del Rosario, a signer of the Malolos Constitution. In 1868, Pe√±arubia was appointed military governor of the Abra province.

It has been called Casa Bizantina because of its Byzantine ornamentation such as a half-moon opening above the large entrance with grill works, arches above the windows of the third floor, engaged columns, and appliqued carvings. However, the house reflects more of the Neo-Mudejar or Spanish-Moorish architectural style. A balcony, or mirador, crowned the roof above the interior's stairs with turned balusters. The stairs leads up to the second and third floors and provides access to both wings of the house. The house was built with a chamfered corner, in compliance with the municipal building regulations before. The streets at the commercial concentrations at Binondo and San Nicolas districts in Manila were narrow; thus, corner buildings were mandated to be built with a chamfer or chaflan in 1869. This regulation led to the creation of eight-sided open spaces, or plazoletas, at every street corner. Present condition The house was occupied by a succession of tenants during the 20th century. It was the first home of the University of Manila in 1914. The nearby community decayed after World War II and the land reclamation for the North Harbor. The old houses became tenements and were torn down to make way for commercial buildings. Casa Bizantina was in miserable condition by 2000. After eight years, the house was declared structurally unsound. Despite its condition, more than 20 families still occupy the house. In 2009, the Don Lorenzo del Rosario House was sold, dismantled, and brought to Bagac, Bataan.

Early years He started his studies at the Ecole Sp√©ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr in October 1878. He participated in the Algerian and Tunisian campaigns and by 1909 commanded the 96th Infantry Regiment. In 1912 he became director of the Infantry at the Ministry of Defence. On 29 January 1913, by now a Brigadier General, he became head of the cabinet of the Minister of Defence.

In April 1917 he received field command of the 28th Division and in December 1917 of the 17th Army Corps. On 29 March 1918, he became commander of the 12th French Army Corps, which was stationed in Italy. At the same time, the Tenth Army returned to France, leaving only the 12th Army Corps on the Italian Front. Graziani thus became commander of the French troops in Italy, and helped to repulse in June the Austrian offensive during the Battle of the Piave River. For the final Battle of Vittorio Veneto, the Italians gave him command of their 12th Army, with which he gained a great victory. After a short return to France, he became in April 1919 commander of the French Danube Army in Romania, and from August 1919-February 1920 was French representative to the Inter-Allied Military Mission in Hungary. In December 1920 he received command of the 18th French Army Corps. From 1921 until his retirement in 1924, he was a member of the Conseil sup√©rieur de la guerre.

The genus contains a single described species, Usomyrma mirabilis, that is known from two Middle Eocene fossils which were found in Scandinavian amber in Denmark. History U. mirabilis is known from two isolated fossils, the holotype and paratype, both of which were housed in the collections of the Zoological Museum of the University of Copenhagen. The fossils are of two complete adult males which have been preserved as inclusions in transparent chunks of Scandinavian amber, also known as Danish amber, found in Denmark. Scandinavian amber is thought to be similar in age to Baltic, Bitterfeld and Rovno ambers, being approximately late Eocene in age. The four amber faunas have been shown to share 17 ant species in common, which make up over 80% of the specimens in amber collections studied for a 2009 paper. Though a large portion of specimens from Scandinavian amber are of species found in the other ambers, the overall fauna found is notably different from the other three. About twenty-four genera with thirty-five species of ants have been identified as inclusions in Scandinavian amber. The fossils were first studied by paleoentomologists Gennady M. Dlussky of the Moscow State University, Alexander Radchenko of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Dmitry Dubovikoff of the Saint Petersburg State University. Their 2014 type description of the new genus and species was published in the journal Acta Palaeontologica Polonica. They coined the genus name as a combination of the Russian Us meaning \\"mustache\\" and often used vernacularly in Russia to mean insect antennae, plus myrmecos which is Greek for \\"ant\\". The combination was in recognition of the distinct structuring of the antennae on the males. The specific epithet is from the Latin word mirabilis which translates as \\"wonderful, marvellous, or miraculous\\", a nod to the unique morphology of the species. Classification and taxonomy Based on interpretation of the wing venation in the U. mirabilis, Dlussky et al suggested the genus was a member of the Dolichoderinae tribe Leptomyrmecini along with the living Leptomyrmex \\"spider ants\\" and the Sicilian amber genus Leptomyrmula. They noted that an unsubscribed male Leptomyrmex male in Dominican amber was distinct enough from the Dominican amber species Leptomyrmex neotropicus to possibly warrant being placed into a new genus, but a full description of the male had not taken place as of 2014. Dlussky et al thought U. mirabilis represented an ancestral wing venation for the tribe, with a progression in vein reduction being present in Leptomyrmula. The Leptomyrmex was treated as a descendant genus of the ancestral form Usomyrma in the classification suggested by Dlussky et al. A 2016 study showed the central cell reduction, on which placement of the genus was based, was shown to be derived several times in the subfamily and not specific to the tribe Leptomyrmecini. The study included the description of the species Leptomyrmex relictus from Brazil, and study of the micro- Leptomyrmex clade species. While the macro-Leptomyrmex species have a very reduced wing venation, the micro-Leptomyrmex clade is nested inside the macro species but have retained much of the vein structure unlike the macro-species. This mosaic of both retained wing venation and reduced wing venation within Leptomyrmex contradicted the gradual vein loss hypothesis that was proposed for an evolutionary grade of Usomyrma - Leptomyrmula - Leptomyrmex. As such both Usomyrma and Leptomyrmula were moved to being placed in Dolichoderinae without tribal placement. Drawing of the Leptomyrmula maravignae male Description The described males are approximately with a slender profile and elongated appendages. The head is rectangular in outline, being slightly longer than wide, with a straight rear margin and rounded rear edges. Behind the compound eyes, the temples are long with an elevated occiput sporting three large ocelli. Each of the two compound eyes are big, being 0.6 of the head length, with a reniform outline, the concave side of the eye along the front sides. The clypeus is distinct in outline, being elongated with the middle swollen to form an almost triangular bump pointing forward and the rear section of the clypeus is retangular and flattened. Each of the mandibles are triangular and long with a dentate chewing edge that is long and curved showing a pointed apical tooth and at least smaller teeth. Below the crossed mandible tips are the six segmented maxillary palps and the four segmented labial palps. The antennae are elongated with 13 segments, the second funicular segment being distinctly elongate and curved. The fore-wings show a well developed pterostigma and venation that forms several fully closed cells.

Behind them are a chainlink fence and a small rise Maybrook Yard was a major rail yard located in Maybrook, New York. It was the western gateway of its long-time owner, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and its predecessors. It was here that freight cars were interchanged between railroads from the west and the New Haven, whose Maybrook Line headed east over the Poughkeepsie Bridge to the railroad's main freight yard at Cedar Hill in New Haven, Connecticut. The rail line through the yard was finished in 1889 by the Hudson Connecting Railroad. The yard was soon acquired by the Central New England Railway, but traffic never justified more than one yard and a five-stall roundhouse. The yard was transformed after control of the Maybrook Line was purchased in 1904 by the New Haven who saw it as an easier way to get their heavy freight traffic across the Hudson River than using barges in New York City. To handle the new traffic the yard was dramatically expanded in 1912 to three miles in length with six separate yards including two hump yards. A new 10-stall roundhouse with a 95-foot turntable replaced the original and was later expanded to 27 stalls. Also added was a large icing plant for refrigerator cars. At its height, the yard had 177 tracks totaling over 71 track-miles. By the 1950s the yard had shrunk to 99 tracks and around 50 track-miles. In 1960 both hump yards were converted to conventional yards with flat switching. By the mid-1960s, freight switching activity had fallen to what it was before the New Haven gained control as connecting railroads shut down or merged, allowing the remaining traffic to run-through without being switched. The Penn Central's acquisition of the New Haven in 1969 resulted in connecting traffic with the Erie Lackawanna being discouraged as it competed with other Penn Central routes. After 1971 only one train in each direction (for the Erie Lackawanna) stopped, but only to change crews. Traffic through the yard ended abruptly in 1974 when the Poughkeepsie Bridge burned and was not repaired, severing the Maybrook Line. By then the yard had already closed. For much of its existence six class I railroads interchanged traffic at the yard with the New Haven Railroad. In 1956 the yard saw 19 arrivals and 18 departures of which 14 were operated by the New Haven, eight by the Lehigh and Hudson River Railway, seven by the Erie Railroad, four by the New York, Ontario and Western Railway, two by the Lehigh and New England Railroad and two by the New York Central Railroad. Today much of the former yard has been converted into a Yellow Freight truck facility. Rail service is still provided to customers in Maybrook by the Middletown and New Jersey Railroad on tracks owned by Norfolk Southern.

The earliest recorded date for coal mining in Nailsea was 1507 when coal was being transported to light fires at Yatton. By the late 1700s the Golden Valley area of the town had a large number of pits run by a consortium by Peter Cox, Joseph Whitchurch and Isaac White which was formed in 1786 and known as White and Co. John Robert Lucas joined to obtain coal for the nearby Nailsea Glassworks. Remains of the old pits, most of which had closed down by the late 19th century as mining capital migrated to the richer seams of South Wales, are still visible around the town. Three buildings survive from the Elms Colliery. The engine house of the rotative beam engine and associated buildings, including the remains of a horse whim and weighbridge house are Grade II listed buildings.

He is credited with helping to contribute to the growth of modern neuroanatomy through his use of novel anterograde tracing techniques which fundamentally transformed the field in the 1970s.Windhorst, Uwe; Johansson, H√•kan. 1999. Modern Techniques in Neuroscience Research. Springer Science & Business Media. pp. 443‚Äì444. . Cowan was vice-president and chief scientific officer of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute from 1987 until his retirement in 2000. Early life and education William Maxwell Cowan was born to Scottish parents in Johannesburg, South Africa, on 27 September 1931. In the 1920s, Cowan's family, who previously worked in the shipbuilding industry in Scotland, emigrated to South Africa to look for mining jobs in Transvaal Province after the British government closed many of their shipyards in Glasgow during a peacetime downturn. Growing up in Johannesburg, Cowan attended Germiston High School and graduated at the age of 15. Cowan was unsure as to what he would do after graduation, as nobody in his family had ever attended university. It was decided that he would apprentice at a local law firm and attend law school part time. However, when the firm discovered how young he was, they asked Cowan's family to enroll him at University of the Witwatersrand for at least one year, where he would study prelaw with the goal of specialising in real estate law.Raisman, Geoffrey. 2008. \\"William Maxwell Cowan. 27 September 1931 ‚Äì 30 June 2002.\\" Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society, 54: 117‚Äì136. 12 December. Squire, Larry R. (ed). (2004). William Maxwell (Max) Cowan. The History of Neuroscience in Autobiography. Volume 4. Elsevier. pp. 144‚Äì209. . Cowan's interest in a legal career that first year soon waned, and he became more aware and troubled by the inequality between whites and blacks in South African society. He decided to change careers and study medicine instead when a friend of the family recommended it as way for him to dedicate his life to serving the community. He studied medicine at the University of the Witwatersrand (1951, BSc), several years prior to Sydney Brenner, whom he met at the school. In 1953, at the recommendation of anthropologist Raymond Dart, Cowan went on to Hertford College, Oxford, to study neuroanatomy and perform doctoral research under Wilfrid Le Gros Clark, earning his DPhil (1956) and his BM BCh (1958).Van Essen, David C.; Joseph L.

(19 November 191216 August 1999) was a Belgian missionary, sinologist, and academic best known for his studies on the grammar of Classical Chinese, oracle bone script, and on the varieties of Chinese. He was a member of the Congregatio Immaculati Cordis Mariae (Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary) missionary order, and proselyted in China in the 1930s, then later became a professor of Chinese at the University of Washington.  Life and career   Early life  Paul Leo-Mary Serruys was born on 19 November 1912 in Heule, a village in the West Flanders region of Belgium. Serruys was one of seven children, and his father was a successful brewer. His primary education was in local village schools, after which he began boarding at a Catholic high school in nearby Kortrijk. The school required students to become fluent in French and German, as well as in the Latin and Greek Classics, which stimulated Serruys' interest in linguistics and philology. During his time in secondary school, Serruys became a strong supporter of the Flemish Movement. In 1930, after he completed secondary school, Serruys followed his older brother Henry in joining the novitiate of the Congregatio Immaculati Cordis Mariae (Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary), a Roman Catholic missionary order focused on East Asia and Africa. Inspired by the examples of prominent Catholic missionaries in China such as Matteo Ricci and Theophiel Verbist, the founder of the C.I.C.M., Serruys and his brother began intensively studying Mandarin Chinese, Classical Chinese, and other Chinese dialects at the Catholic University of Leuven. After several years of study, Serruys was ordained a Catholic priest on 4 August 1936 and departed for China one year later in August 1937.  China  Serruys arrived in Tianjin in November 1937 after a difficult two-month sea voyage, then traveled by train to his assigned parish in Xicetian (), a small village in Shanxi Province located between Datong city and Hunyuan County along the banks of the Sanggan River. At the time, the area was occupied by the Japanese Army, while the countryside was patrolled by Chinese guerrilla fighters and bandits, making travel often dangerous. Serruys focused his efforts on studying the local dialect, which was a variety of Jin Chinese. Serruys' focus on studying the local language was often criticized by other missionaries, who felt he cared more about linguistic research than ministering to his congregants and proselytizing. Much of his early scholarship focused on correcting errors in existing translations of prayers, missals, and catechisms. In March 1943, Serruys and his fellow missionaries were placed under house arrest by the Japanese, first in the Weihsien Internment Camp, then at the chapter house of the Jesuits in Beijing. Serruys was released with the rest of the captives in late 1945 following Japan's unconditional surrender and the end of World War II, whereupon Serruys was sent to Zhangguantun (), a township several miles outside of Cangzhou in Hebei Province. Conditions were poor due to the continuation of the Chinese Civil War, and Serruys was forced to hide most of his religious materials to prevent their confiscation by the anti-religious Communist Party of China forces after the Kuomintang lost control of the region in 1946. Serruys moved back to Beijing in 1947, where he taught at a C.I.C.M. academy and studied at Fu Jen Catholic University.  Berkeley  In 1949, Serruys and other C.I.C.M. missionaries who had been in China for more than 10 years were evacuated home to Europe. The C.I.C.M assigned Serruys and his brother to pursue graduate study in Chinese, so Serruys went to the University of California, Berkeley while his brother went to Columbia University. He arrived at Berkeley, California in 1950, where he studied under the prominent Russian-American sinologist Peter A. Boodberg, Chinese linguist Y. R. Chao, American linguist Mary Haas, and German sociologist Wolfram Eberhard. The C.I.C.M. did not provide Serruys with financial support during his time at Berkeley, so he supported himself by working as a chaplain and saying Mass and hearing confession at local Catholic churches. He received his Ph.D. in 1956 with a dissertation entitled \\"Prolegomena to the Study of Chinese Dialects of Han Time According to Fang Yen\\", a study of the Fangyan, an ancient Chinese dialect dictionary compiled in the 1st century AD by Yang Xiong. After receiving his Ph.D., Serruys received a Guggenheim Fellowship allowing him to continue working on his studies of the Fangyan for two years, resulting in his 1959 book The Chinese Dialects of Han Time According to Fang Yen.  Teaching  In 1962, Serruys left Berkeley to take up a position as director of the Chinese program at Georgetown University's Institute for Languages and Linguistics. He taught there for three years until 1965, when he was offered a professorship in early Chinese language at the University of Washington by Li Fang-Kuei. Serruys accepted, and was a professor at Washington for 16 years. Serruys recalled his time at Washington as \\"the happiest of his life\\", teaching courses on Classical Chinese and the development of Chinese characters. Serruys' Classical Chinese courses were some of the first to \\"[approach] classical texts from the standpoint of a carefully defined grammatical framework, strictly and rigorously applied in analysis\\". Early in his time at Washington, Serruys focused his research on Chinese bronze inscriptions, but later became engrossed in the study of oracle bone script. His research culminated in his article \\"Studies in the Language of the Shang Oracle Inscriptions\\", published in T'oung Pao in 1974, which is considered \\"a cornerstone of [the] field\\" among Western scholars. He retired in 1981 due to a policy that required professors to retire at age 70, which was common at U.S. universities in the 20th century. Retirement and later life The C.I.C.M had no chapterhouse in the Pacific Northwest, so Serruys decided to move to Taiwan after his retirement from the University of Washington. He struggled to adjust to life in Taiwan and began having some health problems, and so returned to the U.S. in 1985. In 1994, the C.I.C.M convinced Serruys to move to their retirement facility in Kessel-Lo, a village outside of Leuven in Belgium. The order provided space for Serruys' large book collection, and he spent the last years of his life doing as much research and correspondence as his health allowed. In 1999 he suffered a serious seizure possibly caused by a stroke, which severely weakened his body and mind. Serruys died in Kessel-Lo on 16 August 1999, aged 86.

Its peculiar shape is due to the nave being older than the choir. It belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies in the Diocese of Visby (Sweden). History The oldest parts of the presently visible church is the nave, dating from the late 12th century. Oak planks decorated with dragons have however been found on the site, and indicate that there may have existed an earlier, wooden church on the spot. The tower dates from the early 13th century, and from the end of the same century dates the dis-proportionally large choir and sacristy. The choir replaced an earlier, smaller choir, but plans to replace also the nave were never carried out. The church has not been substantially altered since the Middle Ages. The windows date from 1865 and the church was renovated in 1964-65. Architecture The church is built of limestone. The nave and tower are Romanesque in style, while the somewhat later and larger choir is Gothic. The pyramidal tower spire is unusual in that its construction is largely original.

It was founded in 1977. History Prior to 1977, there was no organizing body for women's football in Northern Ireland. Following the case of the Republic of Ireland forming the Women's Football Association of Ireland, the NIWFA was founded in 1977 to be the governing body in Northern Ireland. Prior to official foundation, the inaugural meeting was held in 1976 to form a national league to be played in the summer with 35 minutes each half. The league initially was formed of 18 NIWFA associated teams, however this number later rose to 50. In 1993, the NIWFA became affiliated with the men's Irish Football Association (IFA) but retained sole control of women's football in Northern Ireland. In 1998, the NIWFA became fully integrated with the IFA with the IFA becoming responsible for development of women's football in Northern Ireland while the NIWFA retained its separate identity. Since 2001 the NIWFA has had a representative on the IFA Council. This agreement also allowed the NIWFA to continue playing their league matches on Sundays instead of joining the IFA who had banned Sunday football until 2008. Competitions The NIWFA is responsible for the running of women's competitions in Northern Ireland. They run the Women's Premier League and the IFA Women's Challenge Cup as the major competitions. The NIWFA has the authority to discipline and fine clubs as well as the authority to remove them from competition if clubs fail to fulfill fixtures or lack the sufficient number of players. Both were factors in the NIWFA ejecting and banning Fermanagh Mallards F.C. from the Women's Premier League in 2013.

Biography  Maximilian Alexeyevich Kravkov was born on 10 September 1887 in Ryazan. He was a first-begotten child in the family of Alexey Pavlovich Kravkov (1857-1895), the senior doctor of the 11th ¬´Fanagoriyskiy¬ª Grenadiers Regiment, and his wife Antonina Ivanovna.

His art is based on figuration dissolving into abstraction.  Biography  Held was born in 1953. He studied at the Berlin University of the Arts as a \\"Meistersch√ºler\\" (Master Disciple) of Dietmar Lemcke from 1972 to 1979, and was granted a scholarship at Garrucha (Spain) by the \\"German National Academic Foundation\\" (Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes). In 1993 he became professor at the Berlin University of the Arts.Cfr. Helfen und warnen (Helping and Warning), in: UniSPIEGEL, 29 November 2004. and later served as a professor at the China Academy of Art (\\"Chinesisch-deutsche Kunstakademie\\") in Hangzhou, PRC. Held is responsible for the organization of the cooperation of the Berlin University of the Arts and China.Cfr. German Week 2012, in: Hanghzou Daily, 13 Oktober 2012.  Work  Burkhard Held is a figurative painter, who dissolves his motifs ‚Äì landscapes, portraits, flowers ‚Äì into color fields with a strong tendency towards autonomy. His strongly colored all-over images reinterpret things as abstract and then lead the back into figuration. In 2009 Held started to dedicate himself to the subject of flowers: blossoms become compositions with a landscape character, and are distributed in equally strong colors across the canvas. Thus they gain lyrical overtones and additional brightness.Cfr. Bettina Krogemann: Blumen sind bei Burkhard Held reine Malerei (Burkhard Helds' flowers are pure painting), in: DIE WELT, 17 April 2010. Hence Held has also begun to contrast figurative elements (such as the sky) - intentionally without painterly differentiation - with a hatching-like color field technique; this in traditional, monumental formats of his work.Cfr. the chapter Burkhard Held, in: Gerhard Charles Rump, Rekonstruktionen.

It was built by a wealthy merchant and businessman of Rawalpindi, Rai Bahadur Sujan Singh. The haveli was built to resemble a royal palace with a majestic golden throne and bedrooms with original ivory furniture. In the various courtyards dancing peacocks were kept to dance during the evening and a pet tiger was kept which regularly walked the corridors. Musicians were given residence in the haveli who played during the evenings. An Aqueduct connected to 30 lines provided a reliable water supply. The mansion had two main wings connected by a bridge at the fourth floor. The mansion also served as a museum for the family of Rai Sujan Singh. It contained family pictures, antiques, Victorian furniture, China and the family silverware. Architecture The enclosed area of the haveli was 24,000 sq.ft (2,230 sq. meters) which consisted of four stories with a total of 45 rooms. The rooms had large windows and were lit on evenings by large lamps and chandeliers. The embellishments and the wooden decoration of the haveli borrowed a lot from Central Asian and European architectures. The main materials used in the building are brick and timber. The haveli reflects traditional building styles used by the prominent Jat Sikh families of that era. The timber used was local which could have been easily procured since the Singh family owned a prosperous timber business. Iron imported from Britain (but cast locally) was used in the construction of the ornate pillars and carvings on the doorways. One of the most beautiful pieces of the mansion is the ornate and curved staircase from the ground floor up to the fourth floor. The ceilings of the first floor have ornately carved false wooden overlays. The pattern on the panels is clearly Central Asian and follows the same patterns as the used by many buildings of the prominent Sethi Mohallas in Peshawar. This adds weight to the argument that most prominent features of the buildings decoration are Central Asian. Post Partition After independence the haveli gradually fell into ruin. One part of the haveli was completely destroyed with cave ins and cracked walls while the second part suffered from damaged foundation and nearly complete destruction of the elaborate wood panels. The Pakistani government settled Kashmiri refugees in the haveli who destroyed the artistic woodwork before being evacuated in 1980. There were rumours that the building would be handed over to scientist A.Q. Khan for establishing a science college for women, but the plan never materialised. Politician Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad gained the majority of share in the haveli and on 19 October 2006 he, the then federal minister from Rawalpindi, announced that the building would be converted into a campus for The Fatima Jinnah Women University, and its custody was handed over to the university. Restoration efforts In early 2014, Fatima Jinnah Women University turned over the administration and upkeep of the historic haveli to the National College of Arts for a three-year period. NCA Director Dr Nadeem Omar Tarar commented on the takeover by NCA Rawalpindi camp and the decision to build a field school and a museum saying ‚ÄúWe will survey the building first, and then we will move to establish a museum and a field school... As part of an institutional partnership, the three institutions signed an agreement a few days ago to establish a field school at the haveli to document and preserve the building as well as promote traditional arts by turning a part of it into a museum and learning centre for students from all three institutions,‚Äù References Category:Havelis Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1893 Category:Rawalpindi District Category:Houses in Pakistan Category:Residential buildings in Pakistan ","title":"Haveli Sujan Singh"},{"id":"44930833","text":"Acridoschema itzingeri is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

The choir is about a century later and replaced an earlier and smaller Romanesque choir. Plans to also enlarge the nave and tower were never executed. The sacristy dates from 1795. Renovation have been carried out in 1935-36 under the direction of architect Erik Fant (1889-1954). Additional renovation was undertaken during 1976 and 1985-86. The church is the property of the Church of Sweden and lies the Diocese of Visby. Architecture The church has two decorated entrance portals on the south fa√ßade. Of these, the choir portal is considered one of the most peculiar on Gotland. The church tower is decorated with side galleries to the south and north, and has two openings for the church bells, each divided by colonnettes, on every side. The church roof is supported by rib vaults, which is unusual for churches on Gotland. The whitewashed church is covered by a pitched roof. inside, murals from the 13th and 14th century decorate the walls. In the windows, medieval stained glass has been preserved (probably dating from the second half of the 14th century). The baptismal font is from the 12th century.

It was also known as 'Dagenham' manor, 'Dagenhams' and 'Dagenham Place' throughout the centuries. Today, the once open area has been consumed by suburbia.  The Manor of Jenkins in Essex, England  It was originally property of the Abbey of Barking, and was granted status of a freehold. This meant throughout time it was put for lease and indeed some manorial Lords did also lease nearby tenements. As such the estate at its largest spread as far as Dagenham village and it was found in some historical records to have stretched as far as East Hall. The original estate was located in present-day Mayesbrook Park in the London Borough of Barking & Dagenham, north of where Eastbury manor house stands today. Eastbury is a popular tourist attraction. Records from 1540 suggest that, at an ancient and unknown time, Barking Abbey had allowed the holding of Jenkins to a family recorded as Fitz-stephen, at a rent of 4 shillings and 4 pence.'The ancient parish of Barking: Manors', in A History of the County of Essex: Volume 5, ed. W R Powell (London, 1966), pp. 190-214 http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/essex/vol5/pp190-214 [accessed 30 December 2014] In 1273 the manor of Jenkins was recorded as being held by Emery de Bezill, for a rent of 8 shillings 8 pence and a suit-court. The Bishop of Winchester was leased Jenkins by Robert Osborne in 1448 for a rent of ¬£13 6 shillings 8 pence. Osborne was purported to have assaulted the Abbess in 1450 over a disagreement regarding his access rights to a tenement he held in the Abbey grounds. Records show that in 1456 the manor was owned by the Abbey and was leased to a T. Plomer for a rent of 31 shillings 2 pence. Records show that in 1479-80 Jenkins was purchased by a H. Brown and H. Wodecock. They sold Jenkins to a H. Brice, who held the neighbouring manor of Mal-maynes, further down the Mayes Brook towards the marshes. His son received the manor, but he was a child and died without heirs of his own. It then passed to his sister who married the Master of the Mint to Henry VIII, Robert Amadas. In 1555, the Jenkins estate belonged to Frances and Martin Bowes. In 1567-68 the manor was conveyed to Henry Fanshawe who died later that year. His nephew then received the manor dying in 1601. The manor passed to his wife, but reverted to the Crown in 1628 and it was conveyed to Sir Thomas Fanshawe, their son. Documents describe the house of the time as a large gabled building which included a chapel with a window of stained glass containing an image of a woman suspected to be a depiction of the Abbess. A farmhouse stood on the original manor house site until 1937 when what was then called Jenkins farm was torn down for development of the expanding suburbs of London. By tradition, a court baron and a court leet were held annually at Barking in April and a manorial court at Ilford in October.Ogborne, E.

It lies on the southern perimeter of the Fichtel Mountains at a height of 699 metres above sea level (NN) above the village of Sophienthal, which is part of the market borough of Weidenberg in the Upper Franconia county of Bayreuth in Bavaria. The burgstall or lost castle site was partly investigated by means of an archaeological test excavation and was also mapped several times in the past.  History  No records of the castle site have been found and nor is its name known. It could be the fortress listed as \\"Gurtstein mitsamt dem Walde\\" (\\"Gurtstein including the woods\\") mentioned from 1412 in deeds of enfeoffment.Joachim Kr√∂ll: Die Geschichte des Marktes Weidenberg. 1967, p. 52 What is known is that a tower was built on strategically favourable high ground in order to observe the surrounding area with line-of-sight visibility to other signal or beacon hills in the Weidenberg valley, in the upper Steinach valley and in the northern part of the Upper Palatinate (with its large castle on the Rauher Kulm). Over the course of time this motte tower was expanded to form an enclosure with a circular rampart. The local historian, Joachim Kr√∂ll, wrote about it thus:  Role and use  The network of old roads around Weidenberg guarded by the castle The castle originally acted as a motte castle to monitor and guard the historic roads and to serve as a base for military escorts. It also probably fulfilled the function of a border fortress in this Franconian-Bavarian border region. For that it was extended with the construction of several defensive ramparts, in order to create room for troops to be quartered. Traces of these outer ramparts are still visible. The provision of these troops could have come from the hamlet of Neuhaus, to which a water ditch was laid from the area of the Kreuzstein which has survived into the present day. Iron mining in the upper Steinach valley. Because of its location the castle could have been the administrative base mentioned in the records as Gurtstein mitsamt dem Walde and been used to support the royal forestry industry and medieval iron ore extraction, smelting and processing in the Steinach valley, which was later moved to Weidenberg.Heimatbeilage zum Oberfr√§nkischen Schulanzeiger No. 309 dated November 2003: Gustav Schmidt: Einstiger Erzbergbau und entsprechende Verh√ºttung in Nordost- und Ostoberfranken on page 34 in the illustration: ‚ÄúDas Bergbaugebiet auf Eisenerz im Einzugsbereich der Steinach‚Äú The charcoal needed for the production of iron was produced in the densely forested Fichtel Mountains in charcoal piles. A so-called bloomery to extract pig iron was found in the area of the present day Sophienthal. The processing of this iron was carried out in iron hammer mills on the Warme Steinach.  Description of the site  The site consists of an oval-shaped, central mound measuring 30√ó40 metres, which is surrounded by a 6 to 10 metre wide, outer rampart with a ditch. On the uphill side there are two more rows of ramparts and ditches. This system forms two separate areas within the defensive ramparts whose common entrance lay on the west side. In the upper, inner area stood the tower. The whole site covers an area of 200√ó90 metres. The earth ramparts could, have been made even higher by the use of rows of palisades filled with loose rock, as was then usual. In the inner area there is a pit, where excavations were conducted by the History Society of Upper Franconia (Historischer Verein f√ºr Oberfranken) in 1888/89. At a depth of 3 metres on the rocky base they came across a staircase of eight steps hewn out of the mica schist. This may have been the site of the tower. In the inner and northern external area there were probably domestic buildings. These buildings and the tower were made of wood.Hermann Kerscher (Landesamt f√ºr Denkmalpflege): Zweihundert Jahre topografischer Denkmalvermessung in Bayern, Anmerkungen zu fr√ºhen arch√§ologisch-topographischen Pl√§nen des Ruinenkartographen Johann Christoph Stierlein, Arch√§ologisches Jahr Bayern, Stuttgart, 1989, p. 207 The size of the site suggest it had pan-regional significance. It lay on a wooded, domed hilltop whose view into the Weidenberg valley is obscured today, Weidenberger Tal, in the northern Upper Palatinate (Rauher Kulm) and to the Bocksleite opposite, a hill ridge over which a trade and military road ran in the late 8th and 9th centuries. This ran from Bamberg and the Upper Mainland into the Egerland.Map of the trade route Other historic roads ran from north to south into the interior of the Fichtel Mountains and from east to west towards Eger (now Cheb).Joachim Kr√∂ll: Die Geschichte des Marktes Weidenberg. 1967, pp. 18‚Äì21 In the archives of the History Society of Upper Franconia were several finds from test excavations on the Schlossh√ºgel in the years 1846 and 1888/89. Amongst the artefacts found were shards of earthenware jars decorated with wavy lines, coal, bones and iron objects.

There are also location sketches by Erich von Guttenberg from 1921 and Joachim Kr√∂ll from 1966 in his book Geschichte des Marktes Weidenberg (\\"History of the Market Town of Weidenberg\\"). A geodetic survey of the site was carried out in 1989 by Hermann Kerscher of the Bavarian State Office for Heritage Conservation (Bayerisches Landesamt f√ºr Denkmalpflege). In his work on heritage site surveys Hermann Kerscher compares the 1791 drawing of the circular rampart by Stierlein with the modern survey of 1989.Hermann Kerscher: Zweihundert Jahre topografischer Denkmalvermessung in Bayern.

There is a suitable hikers' car park, the Wanderparkplatz Sophienthal, on Sophienthal Circular Walk 5 by the Weidenberg Branch of the Fichtelgebirge Club.Route des Wegenetzes (pdf; 502 kB) After 3 kilometres the route reaches the abandoned settlement of Neuhaus. This is a ruined hamlet, which formerly had five farmhouses, set in an secluded forest clearing. Today the only building left is one used by the forestry commission. At the information board on the circular path, a waymarked path branches off and runs for about 500 metres southwards following the contours to the burgstall on the left of the path. From Neuhaus the nearby ruins of Wurzstein Castle can also be visited on a direct route over the so- called Rosssteig path. In addition there is another path to the abandoned hamlet of Sonnengr√ºn. Under the title Mittelalter im Steinachtal (\\"Middle Ages in the Steinach Valley\\") the Association of the Fichtelgebirge Nature Park have erected information boards at the car park (Wanderparkplatz Sophienthal), in Neuhaus and on the Schlossh√ºgel hill itself.

The valley is the main constituent of the Gauja National Park founded in 1973. The valley started forming approximately one million years ago in the Quaternary glaciation period. The final formation of the valley occurred during a last period of glacial activity 10,000 to 20,000 years ago. The glaciers melted and covered the territory of Latvia several times, and the melting waters settled in the terraces of the valley and transported field stones, gravel, and clay. Geographically, the Gauja valley played a role during the Livonian Crusades due to its existing network of waterways and land roads ( of Livonia). The valley was also home to a variety of ethnic groups who each controlled their own lands (Livonians, Ydumea people, Letts and Vends). During the 13th century several new stone castles of the Livonian Order (Sigulda Medieval Castle, Cƒìsis Medieval Castle, Valmiera Castle) and the Archbishop of Riga (Turaida Castle) were built here.

The area of the island is recorded as in Rick Livingstone's tables, although it is not listed by Hamish Haswell-Smith in his tabulation of Scottish islands greater in size than .Haswell-Smith (2004) pp. xii, 206, 244 No reason for this is given and his area calculation presumably provided a figure smaller than this total. Loch Maddy contains a bewildering profusion of islands and islets. To the north west lie the smaller island of Fearamas and the complex island of Cliasaigh Mor/Cliasaigh Beag. The entrance to the sea loch is to the south east where lie the waters of The Minch. The village of Lochmaddy is to the west on the far side of the loch. Flodday is separated from North Uist by the narrows of Caolas Loch Portain.

The first edifice of the church at Irapeli (now Aruvuthura) was made of granite stones in the manner of Hindu temples. As it is traditionally believed that St. Thomas, the apostle of India who preached the Christian faith in the important and popular villages of Malabar. It is believed that St. Thomas visited Irapeli and converted a prominent families into christianity and laid a cross on the banks of the Meenachil River. Local traditions also support this belief. This is the first church in the Palai diocese and was built in the 1st century. St. Thomas founded seven and a half churches there. (He laid a cross at Irapoli making the church of Irapeli the half church.) It is reported that the church was rebuilt once or twice before the 16th century. The ancient churches were constructed and maintained by the prominent families in the area until the 16th century. In the beginning of the 16th century a new church was built under the leadership of Kallarackal Kathanar by the prominent families. The church was first dedicated to the Virgin Mother, assumed into heaven. In the 14th century when either the Nilackal Church or the Chayal Church founded by St. Thomas was destroyed, several families migrated to Irapeli bringing with them a statue of St. George. Ever since the advent of the statue, the people began to have unflinching faith in the saint and he has been particularly beneficial in bestowing favours on his followers. Because of the numerous favours obtained through the intercession of the saint, in the 16th century, the church was dedicated to him and his statue was placed in the central niche above the main altar. As a result, St. Mary's church Irapeli became known as St. George's Church Irapeli. The 16th-century church was demolished in 1951 but the sanctuary with its vaulting within the right transept of the cruciform church was preserved to enshrine the statue of St. George, its second patron. Some believe the statue to be miraculous. The church is a cruciform building in the Gothic style, facing to the west towards Jerusalem. It was completed in 1952. This church is just app 7 kms away from St. Alphonsa's Tomb, Bharananganam. Both churches are on the main road side and buses are easily available.

The film's title references the amount of pocket money that Aboriginal children were to be paid for their forced labour, although few ever received it. Overview Lousy Little Sixpence begins with the testimonies of survivors of the Stolen Generations who were born in the early 1900s. Later, the film documents the work of Jack Patten and the Australian Aborigines Progressive Association in the 1930s, and ends with the Day of Mourning on 26 January 1938, which marked 150 years of European settlement in Australia. Production Lousy Little Sixpence took three years to research and produce. In the early stages of production, the film's producers Alec Morgan and Gerald Bostock travelled through New South Wales and Victoria while receiving unemployment benefits, looking for information on the Stolen Generations to include such as newspaper articles, films and photographs.

Early history Carmarthen's medieval bridgeA stone bridge crossing the River Tywi at Carmarthen, nine miles from the river's confluence with the Bristol Channel, \\\\- from \\"A Topographical Dictionary of Wales\\" by S. Lewis (1849). was first recorded in 1233. There was definitely no bridge at Carmarthen in 1188 when Giraldus Cambrensis visited. It is believed that a bridge was built during the 1233 siege of Carmarthen. By 1326 the bridge had clearly become unusable because it had been replaced by a boat service and King Edward II allowed the collection of money from ferryboat men to fund a replacement crossing. The town's prior was still raising money for a replacement bridge in 1362. Therefore, the bridge was repaired after this date. It was repaired and widened several times, in 1777 and 1834. The old bridge had seven arches and was recorded in 1849 as having an iron balustrade. The arches were divided by pointed cutwaters. Ultimately the old bridge was demolished in 1936 to make way for a modern replacement. 20th century The currently existing road bridge is a three-arch concrete structure designed in 1933 by the architect Clough Williams-Ellis (best known for designing the village of Portmeirion). Construction of the new bridge began in May 1936. Completed at a cost of ¬£89,091, it came into public use in September 1937. It was officially opened by the Minister of Transport, Leslie Burgin, in April 1938. The Williams-Ellis bridge has curved grey sandstone cutwaters between each arch. The parapets are built up with layers of sandstone ashlar, alternating in thickness. There are Georgian style octagonal lamps attached to the parapets above each arch. The parapets continue some distance beyond the ends of the bridge, for example the southwest parapet curving down Station Approach towards the nearby Carmarthen Railway Station. The bridge was Grade II listed in 2003, being an early 20th- century concrete bridge designed by an important Welsh architect.

This social aversion and bias is often facilitated and perpetuated in the media through the stereotyping of Muslims as violent and uncivilised. Various Australian politicians and political commentators have capitalised on these negative stereotypes and this has contributed to the marginalization, discrimination, and exclusion of the Muslim community. Islamophobia and intolerance towards Muslims has existed well prior to the September 11 attacks on the United States. For example, Muslim immigration to Australia was restricted under the White Australia Policy (1901-1975). Definition Islamophobia in Australia is understood as a set of negative beliefs concerning the religion of Islam, as well as a contemporary outlet for general public anger and resentment towards migration and multiculturalism. Theories Anti-Muslim prejudices are thought to be sourced from a perceived lack of integration among Muslim migrants, and reconfiguration of community and ethnic politics. As part of Islamophobia, Muslims were reduced to caricatures of misogynists and oppressed women; violent men were thought as inclined to terrorism. The Australian media is noted for presenting portrayals of Muslim immigrants in a negative manner, although in comparison to other Western countries, Australian media exhibits less bias as a result of its coverage of the everyday life of Australian Muslims. According to some scholars, public discourse rectifying negative images of Islamic culture result in an unfounded fear of actual Muslims; public discourse focusing on the Western values of women's rights enabled Islam and Islamic clerics to be portrayed as misogynist and oppressive towards women. Some theorists maintain that, increasingly since 11 September 2001, the Australian public has attributed Australian Muslims with a sense of \\"otherness,\\" using social constructions and generic misrepresentations of Muslims as a way to regain existential control in a post-9/11 world. Online version. Some scholars have argued that the rise of militant Islam in Australia has led to the increase in Islamophobia and undone efforts by Muslims to foster positive relations with the Australian public. Incidence Estimates of the prevalence of anti- Muslim sentiment in Australia differ. A large-scale poll published in 2011 found that 48.6 percent of Australians had a negative opinion of Islam. Another survey published in 2014 found that a quarter of Australians held anti-Muslim views; this incidence was five times higher than that for any other religion. The latter survey also found that 27 percent of Muslim Australians have experienced discrimination, which was also the highest of any of the religions covered in the study. A poll conducted by the University of South Australia's International Centre for Muslim and non-Muslim Understanding released in 2016 found that 10 per cent of Australians have hostile attitudes towards Muslims. Older people, those who had not completed year 12 and people outside the workforce were more likely to report anti-Muslim attitudes in this poll. The accompanying report concluded that the poll shows that \\"most Australians display low levels of Islamophobia\\". A report from Australia has found that the levels of Islamophobia among Buddhists and Hindus are significantly higher than among followers of other religions.Islamophobia, social distance and fear of terrorism in Australia: a preliminary report Incidents of Islamophobia First Gulf War (1990s) During the First Gulf War, there were a number of racist attacks, in some cases including violence against Arabs and Muslims, including Muslim property; Arab-owned shops were looted and vandalised and Islamic institutions received bomb threats. People with the surname \\"Hussein\\" received harassment calls. The Muslim community also dealt with stigmatisation as a result of ASIO's anti- terror efforts. The Australian media had reported that based on ASIO intelligence, New South Wales would be the target of a terrorist attack. In a counterterrorism effort, a number of Arabs and Muslims, including a number of political activists were visited by ASIO personnel; ASIO also conducted a number of wiretaps on Arab and Muslim Australians. No such attack did occur, although the Jewish community experienced a number of racist attacks. Initially, Muslims were blamed for the attacks on the Jewish institutions. However, the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Board concluded that there was insufficient evidence that Muslims were behind the attack. Opposition to Halal certification (2014) In 2014 anti-Islam groups campaigned against Australian food companies in an attempt to stop them having their food certified as being halal. The groups argued that the cost of certification increases the prices of food to all consumers, and that the fees charged for certification were used to fund terrorism. In November 2014 Fleurieu Milk & Yoghurt Company stopped producing halal products after being targeted by campaigners, and a number of other large and small companies were also reported to have been targeted. Keysar Trad from the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils told a journalist in July 2014 that these groups were attempting to exploit anti-Muslim sentiments. In 2015 the far-right, anti- Islam Q Society was involved in a defamation law suit over their claims that the Islamic certification industry is corrupt and funds \\"the push for sharia law in Australia\\". Legal proceedings against senior members of the Melbourne- based Q Society and Kirralie Smith, who runs the website HalalChoices, began after a speech was given at a Q Society event, that portrayed El-Mouelhy as \\"part of a conspiracy to destroy Western civilisation from within\\" and \\"reasonably suspected of providing financial support to terrorist organisations\\". El-Mouelhy claims he has been defamed in relation to the proceeds of halal certification. This case has now been settled out of court. In response to the claims made by Kirralie Smith and HalalChoices, officials from the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission have stated that the commission has been on \\"heightened lookout\\" for links between halal certifiers and terrorism since the issue surfaced last year, but has \\"not found any direct linkages\\", an inquiry has heard. Furthermore, a Senate inquiry into food certification asserted that there was \\"no link\\" between the religious approval process and extremist groups. It recommended that the federal government increase its oversight of domestic halal certifiers to address fraudulent conduct in the sector. It said that it had heard, \\"credible reports suggesting that the lack of regulation has been unscrupulously exploited\\". In tabling the report, committee chairman Sam Dastyari said, \\"Some certifiers are nothing more than scammers.\\" The committee recommended a single halal certification authority. The committee in recommending clearer labelling, specifically referred to the need for meat processors to label products sourced from animals subject to religious slaughter. As of 27 February 2017, as part of a settlement agreement, Kirralie Smith and the Q Society have publicly apologised and agreed to display notice of the settlement on their respective websites for one year. The case was settled out of court.https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2017/02/27/Settlement_Announcement.pdf Rallies and violent confrontations (2015) Anti-Islam Reclaim Australia Rallies have been held across Australia since 2015. Reclaim Australia is a far-right Australian nationalist protest group which is associated with nationalist and neo-Nazi hate groups. The group was formed in 2015, holding street rallies in cities across Australia to protest against Islam. Reclaim Australia primarily opposes Islam in Australia and is considered Islamophobic. The group has attracted neo-Nazis and the involvement of neo-Nazis in promoting and attending Reclaim Australia rallies has been well documented. Speakers at Reclaim Australia rallies have been known to express extremist views, with one speaker in South Australia warning of the risks of \\"Islamic barbarity\\" and encouraging those in attendance to \\"insult and vilify Islam five times a day if you want to.\\" Serious Religious Vilification (2015) The United Patriots Front, a far-right Australian nationalist protest group which is associated with nationalist and neo-Nazi hate groups. protested Zaky Mallah's appearance on Q&A;, a television programme, by roasting a pig outside the Melbourne office of the ABC in an apparent attempt to upset Muslims. In October the same year, the group beheaded a dummy outside the Bendigo City Council chambers to protest the 2015 Parramatta shooting and approval to construct a mosque in Bendigo. In September 2017, they were convicted of \\"serious religious vilification\\" and each were fined $2,000 Australia Day billboard removal (2016) In 2016 a billboard promoting Australia Day celebrations in the Melbourne suburb of Cranbourne was removed after threats and abuse were directed at the advertising company. The Billboard featured two Muslim girls in hijabs waving Australian flags and celebrating Australia Day. Q Society Dinner (2017) Islamophobia was documented at a Q Society fundraising dinner, with numerous guest speakers including current members of the Australian Government present. Speaker Larry Pickering stating that \\"If they (Muslims) are in the same street as me, I start shaking.\\" and that \\"They are not all bad, they do chuck pillow-biters off buildings.\\" adding that \\"I can't stand Muslims\\". The cartoonist also auctioned an overtly Islamophobic work depicting the rape of a woman in a niqab by her son-in-law. Another Larry Pickering cartoon auctioned at the fundraiser depicted an Imam as a pig (in Islam the consumption of all pork products is considered haram or forbidden), being spit roasted, with a \\"halal certified\\" stamp on its rump. A case of wine called \\"72 Virgins\\" was also up for grabs, along with a signed photograph of Dame Joan Sutherland. Kirralie Smith has denied supporting Pickerings statements, however Smith has reiterated parts of the speech stating that \\"there are Muslims that actually do throw gays off buildings!\\". Sitting members of the Australian Government, Cory Bernardi and George Christensen (politician), attracted criticism for speaking at the Q Society of Australia. The event received protests who called the event racist. Christchurch mosque shootings (2019) On 15 March 2019, 51 people were killed in shooting attacks that targeted two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, during Jumu'ah. The perpetrator was identified as Brenton Tarrant, a 28-year-old who was born in Australia and lived in Grafton, New South Wales. Tarrant was regarded as a white nationalist and a neo-fascist who sought to foster an \\"atmosphere of fear\\" within the Muslim community. Independent Queensland Senator Fraser Anning released a statement shortly after the attacks. While Anning condemned the shooting, he identified the cause as \\"the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place,‚Äù and stated that the event reflects increasing Islamophobia in Australia and New Zealand. Anning's comments were roundly criticised by his fellow Australian politicians and commentators. In politics In the 2019 Australian federal election, ten parties were listed by the \\"My vote matters\\" campaign, an initiative of the Islamic Council of Victoria, as openly Islamophobic, with a number of minor parties including such policies as well. Fraser Anning's Conservative National Party was included in the list. The issue only arose briefly as an election issue when two Liberal candidates were disendorsed after extreme views previously expressed on social media were exposed. Responses In 2014, filmmaker Kamal Saleh orchestrated a social experiment to test how Australians would react if they witnessed a Muslim person being abused. In one scene a woman in a hijab is being harassed by a young man; in another it is a young boy who is the target of the discriminatory abuse. Saleh's film showed the non-Muslim Australians standing up to the abuse and defending the Muslim victim.Panahi, Rita. \\"‚ÄòMuslim hate in Australia‚Äô social experiment will make you proud.\\" HERALD SUN. 7 October 2014 Following the 2014 Martin Place siege where an Iranian-Australian gunman took 17 hostages resulting in his death and the deaths of two hostages, a social media campaign in support of Australian Muslims was launched using the hashtag \\"#illridewithyou\\" to assist Muslims who may feel intimidated to use public transportation.\\"Martin Place Siege illridewithyou hashtag goes viral.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald. 16 December 2014. In 2015, academic researcher Susie Latham and Professor Linda Briskman created the \\"Voices against Bigotry\\" website and network, which aim to raise an opposing voice against Islamophobia by encouraging ordinary people and community leaders, particularly politicians, to speak out on the issue. The Voices against Bigotry network has active members across Australia who write articles for the media and academic journals and make public comment. The website acts as a clearing house on anti-Muslim bigotry, advertising events and centralising research and information. Legislation Discriminatory acts against Muslims is prohibited under Australian law, both on a state and federal level. Some acts of legislation include: *Anti-Discrimination Act 1991 (QLD) *Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 (NSW) *Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 *Disability Discrimination Act 1992 *Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001 (Victoria) *Racial Discrimination Act 1975 *Sex Discrimination Act 1984 Critics maintain that legislation concerning islamophobia has been too restrictive in its development, and that the state's response to discriminatory practices against Arabs and Muslims has been too slow. Protesters have been critical of discrimination in the workforce by Muslims in circumstances that relate to religious based employment positions. However all states provide for exceptions to their respective laws regarding discrimination where it occurs for religious purposes. Council for the Prevention of Islamophobia A Council for the Prevention of Islamophobia Inc has been established by the Islamic Research and Educational Academy An Australian speaking tour by Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who as a former Muslim is considered \\"apostate\\" and faces the death penalty in her country of origin, was proposed for April 2017. The Council for the Prevention of Islamophobia told organisers that there would be 5,000 protesters outside the Festival Hall in Melbourne if she was to speak at that venue. Her Australian tour was cancelled. Criticism of term and use The term and its use, is criticised. Professor of Psychology, Nick Haslam from the University of Melbourne says the use of this type of word, \\"brushes aside opinions we dislike by invalidating the people who hold them ... and closes the door on dialogue\\". Professor of Sociology, Clive Kessler from the University of New South Wales has said the term Islamophobia is used to dismiss criticism and is used a rhetorical device, as a \\"moral bludgeon\\" where, > \\"The term Islamophobia is made to serve as a silencing device, and barrier > to necessary public democratic discussion, because, once you term it a > \\"phobia\\", then those at whom its use is directed, together with their views > as well as their basic motivation and intentions, are simply \\"sick\\" . . . . > You can make political capital, to advance you own cause, on the basis of > their imputed moral unacceptability, their evil character. You don't ever > have to argue your own case and position. You just declare and brand your > adversaries morally \\"benighted\\". Economically. With one powerful word or > slogan\\". Brian McNair, Professor of Journalism, Media and Communication at Queensland University of Technology writing in The Conversation in support of, \\"legitimate and increasingly necessary\\" open discussion about Islam says, \\"critiquing Islam [is not] Islamophobia [or] racism [nor is it] anti-Muslim.\\" See also *Anti-Arabism in Australia *Criticism of Islam *Far-right politics in Australia *Islam in Australia *Online Hate Prevention Institute *Racism in Australia *Racial violence in Australia *Reclaim Australia  References   Further reading  * Australian Muslim Voices on Islamophobia, Race and the \\"War on Terror\\" - Bibliography compiled by Randa Abdel-Fattah, April 2019.

The church is classified as a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines. It was formerly nominated to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of the Philippines under two categories, the Baroque Churches of the Philippines (Extension) and the Jesuit Churches of the Philippines. It was totally destroyed when Typhoon Haiyan (locally named as Yolanda) made landfall in Guiuan and struck other parts of Central Visayas on November 8, 2013.  Church history  Guiuan (also spelled as Guiguan) was founded by the Jesuits in 1595. It was handed over to the Augustinians upon instructions from the Spanish colonial government due to the Jesuits Suppression in 1768. It was then transferred to the Franciscans in 1795 but due to lack of priests, Father Miguel P√©rez, the first Franciscan priest of Guiuan was only assigned in 1804. The original church of Guiuan was made of wood and destroyed by fire. The present stone church was dedicated to the Virgin Mary under the title of the Immaculate Conception and was built by the early Jesuits and was renovated by adding a transept and baptistery during the term of Father Manuel Valverde and Pedro Monasterio in 1844. A bell tower on top fort was built in 1854. Another convent was built by Father Arsenio Figueroa in 1872. The church was refurbished in 1935 and the sanctuary was renovated in 1987. On November 8, 2013, the church along with other buildings and structures in Guiuan was severely damaged due to Typhoon Haiyan. While the roof was destroyed and the facade was damaged, the church's stone walls remain unscathed, as do the floors and the crypts. File:Inmaculada Concepcion Parish Church, Guiuan, Eastern Samar (Before and After 2013 Typhoon Haiyan).jpg|Guiuan Church before (left) and after (right) Typhoon Haiyan.  Historical and cultural declarations  The National Museum of the Philippines named Guiuan Church a National Cultural Treasure in 2001. As a nominee for the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of the Philippines, it is grouped with Maragondon Church, Baclayon Church and Loboc Church for the Jesuit Churches of the Philippines and with Boljoon Church, Loboc Church, Tumauini Church and Lazi Church for the Baroque Churches of the Philippines (Extension) nomination. However, due to its total destruction, it was then removed to the roster of nominated sites. Description Guiuan Church is nestled inside a fort. It is well known for its extensive shell ornamentation in its interiors. Studies revealed that at least eight types of seashells were used. Before its destruction, it still has two elaborately carved doors out of the original three doors. The main door on the entrance has exquisite carvings of the Twelve Apostles while a side door has carved representations of angels. Former First Lady Imelda Marcos was interested in purchasing the church's door for ‚Ç±1,000,000 using government funds siphoned by her husband, Ferdinand Marcos. Present condition Due to Typhoon Haiyan, all of its original retablo, roof (dated 1700s) and other church relics were damaged. Only the stone walls and bell tower remained standing. Restoration of the church is on-going under the supervision of the National Museum of the Philippines. Funds for the reconstruction of the church amounting to $300,000 was given by the Embassy of the United States in the Philippines.

The Liberal Democrat group was reduced further in December 2010 when councillor Manny Doku of Bush Fair ward defected to Labour. 34 candidates stood for the 11 seats contested, with the Conservative and Labour group leaders, Andrew Johnson and Mark Wilkinson, defending seats in Church Langley and Harlow Common wards. The Liberal Democrats were defending 2 seats, but their group leader Chris Millington of Bush Fair ward stood down at the election. Conservative councillor Patrick McClarnon also stood down from his Great Parndon ward, while seats in Staple Tye and Sumners and Kingsmoor were vacant after Conservative councillors Lee and Sarah Dangerfield resigned from the council in November 2010. Election result The Conservatives remained in control of the council with 17 councillors, but Labour made 3 gains to move to 14 seats, while the Liberal Democrats dropped to 2 seats. The Labour gains meant they won 7 of the 11 seats contested in 2011, including taking Staple Tye which previously had been held by the Conservatives before the councillor had resigned from the council.

Neff and her co-author Dawn Nafus explore how people record, analyse and reflect on this data, looking at the tools they use and the communities they become part of. They consider self-tracking as a social and cultural phenomenon, describing not only the use of data as a kind of mirror of the self but also how this enables people to connect to, and learn from, others, using data in a way that empowers and educates. It was awarded Co-Winner, American Sociological Association Section on Communication and Information Technologies (CITASA) 2013 Book Award. Venture Labor: Work and the Burden of Risk in Innovative Industries, focuses on the effects of Silicon Alley in the 1990s. The book explores why employees pioneering internet companies chose to invest their time, energy, hopes and human capital in start-up ventures. Neff links this behaviour to a broader shift in society with economic risk shifted from collective responsibility to individual responsibility. She argues that understanding ‚Äòventure labour‚Äô is important for encouraging innovation and creating sustainable work environments that support workers. It won the Best Book Award from the American Sociological Association's Section on Communication and Information Technologies. Surviving the New Economy explores how people working in technology industries are addressing their concerns about the instability in the workplace via both traditional collective bargaining and through innovative actions. Neff and co-authors John Anman and Tris Carpenter draw upon case studies from the United States and abroad, to examine how highly skilled workers are surviving in a global economy in which the rules have changed and how they are reshaping their workplaces in the process.

The books, which are in dual-language format with the original language and English facing, are published by Harvard University Press. The Columbia University scholar, Sheldon Pollock, is the library's general editor. Pollock previously edited the Clay Sanskrit Library. The library was established through a $5.2 million gift from Rohan Murty, the son of Infosys co-founder N. R. Narayana Murthy and social worker and author Sudha Murty. The series will include translations from Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Marathi, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu, other Indian languages and Persian. It will include fiction, poetry, nonfiction, and religious texts from all Indian traditions including Buddhism and Islam. The projected 500 volumes, to be published over a century, have a corpus of thousands of volumes of classic Indian literature to draw on. Inception Sheldon Pollock previously edited the Clay Sanskrit Library, whose funding had ended in 2008, and Pollock was searching for a new sponsor to continue the work in a wider format. Rohan Murty, as a PhD student in Computer Science at Harvard University, was taking courses in ancient Indian literature and philosophy from the Sanskrit Department and developed a deep interest in ancient Indian texts. The two were brought together by Gurcharan Das, leading to the establishment of the Murty Classical Library under the auspices of the Harvard University Press.Elizabeth Kuruvilla, The modern revivalists, LiveMint, Jan 24 2015.

Electronic editions of the works are planned for the future. Criticism on the choice of General Editor In March 2016, a petition initiated by Indian scholars demanded that Sheldon Pollock be removed from the editorship of the Murty Classical Library of India. The petition cites Rajiv Malhotra's book The Battle for Sanskrit, in which Pollock is a major topic. Malhotra criticizes Pollock for his methodologies, which are not being led by a traditional Dharmic point of view,https://www.youtube.com/a30EnICYBUA?t=676https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfQbirNpLM8 and uses political philology which unearths \\"social abuses in the texts (against dalits, women, Muslims) as the predominant quality of those texts\\". According to Malhotra, Pollock takes an activist stance, calling \\"his peers to expunge the Sanskrit tradition of its inbuilt oppressiveness\\" which he describes as prescriptivism. Malhotra rejects these approaches, regarding them as a \\"bias\\" which threaten traditional approaches of Sanskrit texts. He adds, it is unfortunate that most Hindus are \\"largely unaware of what he has written.\\" In a response, Rohan Murty stated that Sheldon Pollock will continue his position, saying that the library will commission the \\"best possible scholar for that particular language. We will not judge on nationality, gender, race, creed or colour.\\" He further questioned the intentions of the petitioners, noting that none of the petitioners had tried to contact him for the past six years.Divya Shekhar & Indulekha Aravind, Rohan Murty says American Indologist Sheldon Pollock to stay, The Economic Times, 3 March 2016.Sudha Pillai, It is always nice to disagree, but don't be disagreeable, Bangalore Mirror, 3 March 2016.

It is in the Diocese of Visby of the Church of Sweden. History and architecture V√§te Church was built during the 14th century. The choir and sacristy are the oldest parts of the church, from circa 1300, while the nave dates from the middle of the 14th century. A tower was planned but never built. The presently visible church probably replaced an earlier, Romanesque church, of which several remains have been incorporated with the presently visible, mostly Gothic church. No major alterations have been made to V√§te Church since the Middle Ages. The church spire was constructed in 1914. The church is built of limestone. The exterior is partially decorated with Romanesque sculpture (the northern portal, decorative reliefs and window dressings), and has two Gothic southern portals with finely sculpted capitals. Inside, the church is decorated with murals. One set dates from the 14th century, another by the so-called Master of the Passion of Christ (Passionsm√§staren) from the 15th century and a third by the so-called Master of 1520 (similar to murals in Alva and Lau churches). The octagonal baptismal font is of sandstone and dated to the 12th century. The altarpiece was painted in 1780 by Johan Niklas Weller (1723-1785) who also painted the altar in 1782. The triumphal crucifix is from the 13th century. The church has undergone restorative works three times during the 20th century: in 1927-28, in 1956 was under the direction of architect Nils Arne Ros√©n (1920-1998) and the work in 1965 under architect Olle Karth (1905-1965).

Life and career  Dugdale's interest in photography started at the age of twelve with his first camera, which was a present from his mother. He attended the School of the Visual Arts in New York City where he majored in photography and art history. In 1983 his photographic work was first presented in a solo exhibition at Vienna's Molotov Art Gallery. The show and the catalogue were curated by Christian Michelides, the founder of the gallery. Thereafter he started a successful decade long commercial career working for such clients as Bergdorf Goodman, Martha Stewart and Ralph Lauren. In 1993, at the age of 33, Dugdale experienced nearly total blindness due to a stroke and CMV retinitis, an HIV-related illness. He became completely blind in his right eye and lost eighty percent visibility in his left eye. He lost his remaining vision in 2010. This tragic event ended his successful commercial career, but he decided to persist in photography and started to explore techniques from the 19th century for fine art photography, using friends and family as assistants. Since then Dugdale has worked with large format cameras, creating cyanotype prints, platinum prints - using the albumen process which became the dominant form of photographic positives from 1855 to the turn of the 20th century. His sensibility for bygone techniques emphasizes the poetics of his work and the transcendence of time and place, seemingly transporting the imagery to a different era. A quote of the nearly blind photographer: ‚ÄúThe mind is the essence of your sight. It‚Äôs really the mind that sees.‚Äù Dugdale has exhibited in over 25 solo shows in galleries all over the world.

Background Elegant Prince was a chestnut horse with a white blaze bred in Kentucky by Leslie Combs II of Spendthrift Farm and Canadian oilman Frank McMahon. He was sired by Raise a Native, an American racehorse who was unbeaten in four races and was named American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt by Turf and Sports Digest in 1963. Elegant Prince's dam Gay Hostess was a highly- successful broodmare, having produced Majestic Prince and Crowned Prince (Dewhurst Stakes) from two previous coverings by Raise a Native. Her other descendants have included Real Quiet, Caracolero and The Derby winner Secreto. At the Keeneland Sales in July 1975 the yearling was sold for a then world- recond price of $715,000, with Franklin Groves winning the auction ahead of the Canadian Ted Burnett. He broke the record set a year earlier by another Spendthrift graduate Kentucky Gold. Both Majestic Prince and Crowned Prince had previously held the record. Racing career Elegant Prince was trained in the United States and was later transferred to Ireland. He did not race in either country.

It was included in Tales of Ten Worlds, a collection of stories by Clarke first published in 1962. It has been translated into French, German, Italian and Croatian.. Retrieved 23 January 2019. The story imagines the development of space tourism. Story summary The narrator, talking as though the subject has arisen during a conversation, tells the story of his association with Morris Perlman. The narrator, back from a pioneering voyage to Saturn, first meets him while breakfasting at his hotel during a lecture tour. Perlman attended the narrator's lecture the previous evening, and tells him that he was always fascinated by Saturn: he saw Chesley Bonestell's paintings; a memorable moment in his youth was seeing the planet for the first time, with a home-made telescope. His father, manager of a hotel in Third Avenue, New York, with business worries, resented his timewasting and destroyed the telescope. When the Third Avenue El closed, land values there rose and the hotel business, now run by Perlman, expanded. The narrator learns afterwards that Perlman owns the hotel where he is staying, and many others. He meets Perlman a few years later, after a second voyage to Saturn, in an expensive restaurant that Perlman owns. Perlman wants to know what it is like to be near Saturn, and the narrator describes it. He asks which moon of Saturn would be best for a tourist resort; he dismisses the response that tourism is out of the question because of the distance and expense, saying that places in the world that were remote centuries ago are now tourist destinations. The narrator suggests Titan. When Perlman is very old, and paragravity drives, of which he financed the research, have replaced rocket propulsion, he offers the narrator a job. The circumstance of the narrator's conversation becomes clear. \\"Even after all these years,\\" he says to his dining companions, \\"I still like to watch Saturn rising.\\" See also * Saturn in fiction * Titan in fiction References Category:1961 short stories Category:Short stories by Arthur C.

He was educated at Harvard University (A.B. 1942), Harvard Business School (M.B.A. 1946), and Harvard Law School (LL.B. 1949.). Career As chief executive of Eastern Gas and Fuel, Goldston ran diversified energy corporation with 19 subsidiaries in the bituminous coal, coke, gas utility and river-ocean marine industries.

He is quoted as having said: \\"I don't believe that business, alone, can solve our social problems. Neither do I believe it, alone, has caused them. But they'll not get solved unless innovative businessmen, who sense a changing world and feel challenged, react in a fashion likely to produce profit as well as imaginative response to social need.\\" Goldston's most visible legacy is the Rainbow Swash, a giant 1971 artwork by Corita Kent that Goldston commissioned on a tall liquefied natural gas tank facing Boston's Southeast Expressway.\\"GasLines: The Rainbow Tank is Sweet Sixteen\\" (PDF), Boston Gas History, Boston Gas via Simpson.net (November 1987).

ADEGA has always been linked with the Galician nationalist movement. The organization has chapters in the comarcas of A Mari√±a, Santiago, Coru√±a, Costa da Morte, Lugo, O Carballi√±o, Ourense, A Paradanta, Barbanza, Ordes, A Ulloa, Pontevedra, Trasancos, and Vigo. History Domingo Quiroga was the first president of the association. The first board of directors included: Francisco Bermejo, Professor of Analytical Chemistry; Xos√© Bar Boo, architect; Xos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Pardo, lawyer; Xos√© Manuel Beiras, national spokesman of the Galician Nationalist Bloc for many years; and Fernando Gonz√°lez Laxe, president of the Xunta de Galicia between 1987 and 1989.At that time he was a member of the PSG; he later joined the Socialists' Party of Galicia and became president. The organization gained prominence participating in the anti-nuclear movement against the construction of a nuclear power plant in the municipality of Xove. After a series of mass protests, plans to build the plant were ultimately abandoned. ADEGA again gained international attention in the 1980s for a campaign against the dumping of radioactive materials in the Atlantic, in collaboration with other organizations including Greenpeace. The campaign managed to block the dumping by putting Galician fishing boats alongside the boats carrying the nuclear waste. The fire aboard the cargo vessel Cason, which caused a toxic cloud in Costa da Morte, sparked another campaign by ADEGA. In the late 1980s ADEGA also led successful campaigns against the building of new dams on the Eume and Navia rivers. The organization's activities have since diversified, to address numerous environmental problems. ADEGA also has a very important presence in social movements like Nunca M√°is and, more recently, in the movement against mining that stopped the Corcoesto gold mine in the municipality of Coristanco. Since 1986 ADEGA has published a quarterly magazine called Cerna, dealing with environmental global problems and their impact on Galicia. Since 2004 ADEGA has promoted the Proxecto R√≠os (Project Rivers), an educational and citizens' initiative in defense of the Galician rivers under which volunteers conduct inspections, make an annual report, and hold conferences and cleaning campaigns when necessary in a river that passes through their municipality. In 2005 Verdegaia was founded as an offshoot of ADEGA. ADEGA was criticized by Galiza non se vende (Galicia is not for sale), a network of social movements that has organized a series of mass protests since 2007, for its excessive dependence on the UPG and BNG.http://www.galizanonsevende.org/?p=705  References   Further reading  * Beramendi, J. and N√∫√±ez Seixas, O Nacionalismo Galego, Edici√≥ns A Nosa Terra, Vigo, 1995. * A Gran Historia de Galicia XIV: A Galicia aut√≥noma (Dende a Transici√≥n), Edici√≥ns Arrecife, A Coru√±a, 2007.

In addition to urban and parkland scenes, he also did portraits.  Life and work  Starr did his studies at the Slade School of Fine Art, where Edward Poynter and Alphonse Legros were among his teachers. In 1874, the school awarded him their prestigious scholarship. From 1882 to 1886, he exhibited at the Royal Academy. His early works were influenced by James McNeill Whistler, in whose studio he worked. When Whistler left the Royal Society of British Artists in 1888, after a disagreement about the organization's future, he took several of his associates, including Starr, Walter Sickert, Philip Steer and Theodore Roussel. Starr then joined Sickert's New English Art Club, and began painting in a more Impressionistic style. In 1889, he participated in an exhibition at the Goupil Gallery in Paris, which introduced English-style Impressionism to the French.Biography of Sydney Starr @ Nicholas Bagshawe Fine Art Later that year, he won a bronze medal at the Exposition Universelle for his depiction of Paddington Station. His most famous work is \\"The City Atlas\\", which can be found in most works on English Impressionism. In 1892, following the collapse of an affair with the wife of his biggest patron, he emigrated to New York, where his work was popular among collectors. He soon received several commissions, including murals for the chapel in Grace Church and 24 paintings for what is now called the Simmons Corridor at the Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress in Washington, DC. He died in 1925 at the age of sixty-two. Some of his works can be seen in the Tate Gallery in London and the National Gallery of Canada.

History The first section of the Merthyr, Tredegar and Abergavenny Railway from Abergavenny to was opened on 29 September 1862. The line was leased and operated by the London and North Western Railway (L&NWR;) which acquired the smaller railway company on 30 June 1866. The L&NWR; was itself amalgamated into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in the 1923 Grouping. Clydach first appeared in Bradshaw in January 1864, however the line's engineer, John Gardner, reported on 27 August 1863 that the station had already opened, with minutes of L&NWR; meetings referring to a projected completion date of mid-September 1863. The station was situated below a quarry-scarred mountainside at the top of which were houses bordered by rock and scree situated ominously near the edge. The station was east of Clydach Viaduct composed of eight semi-circular arches built of old red sandstone with spans on a curve of radius at a gradient of 1 in 38. The viaduct, which is long and high with between the parapets, was designed by Gardner to carry the line over the Clydach Gorge and the Clydach Stream. The distance between the parapets was increased to when the line was doubled in 1877. To the west of the station was the twin-bore Clydach Tunnel (Down ; Up ). The station had two platforms; on the Up platform was a station building of generous proportions constructed of locally sourced limestone. A private siding served the Clydach and Abergavenny Lime and Stone Company which operated a nearby limestone quarry and lime kilns supplying the Clydach Ironworks. The company used its own private owner wagons. The siding trailed off upwards to the north-east at the western end of the viaduct where a weighing machine and office were installed in the fork of the junction. Opposite the weighing machine was a signal box built in 1898. The works closed in after which goods facilities were withdrawn from Clydach on 2 May 1938. Decline in local industry and the costs of working the line between Abergavenny and Merthyr led to the cessation of passenger services on 4 January 1958. The last public service over the line was an SLS railtour on 5 January 1958 hauled by GWR 6959 No. 7912 Little Linford Hall and LNWR Coal Tank No. 58926. Official closure came on 6 January. Present Parts of the platforms and the station house have survived and are divided between two private owners. The trackbed near the station is part of National Cycle Route 46.

In early years, the fish and shrimp found in Chishang came from Dapo area. During the Japanese rule of Taiwan, the pond had a surface area of 55 hectares and there were abundant fish and shrimp inside the water. Lotuses and water chestnuts also grew in the pond. After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, the pond became one of the ten scenic sights of Taitung County under the title The Fishing Line of Chihshang. However, after the Large Dapo Drainage Ditch water conservation facility, natural silting and other factors, the surface area of the pond gradually shrinks. Geology Dapo Pond is an inland freshwater swamp. It was formed as a result of fault activity in Chishang. Its water comes from an underground stream located at the tip of the alluvial fan of Xinwulyu River. The pond river flows northward towards the lowlands, which then becomes the source of Xiuguluan River. Under the planning and revitalization efforts from Taitung County Government, the pond now has a surface area of around 20 hectares with another 20 hectares on its surrounding embankments and wetlands. Features The area around the lake features several facilities, such as bike routes, footpath, pavilions, fishing area, bird watching area and garden.

Before the AIDS crisis, Hannan was pursuing a career in Europe as an opera singer, but returned to New York City when the crisis hit. In 1986, he founded the PWA Health Group with Joseph Sonnabend and Michael Callen. This nonprofit organization was the first and largest formally recognised AIDS buyers' club, which aimed to widen access to promising AIDS therapies not yet approved by the FDA; the PWA Health Group went on to become an important source of AIDS treatment education and advocacy. In 2000, DAAIR, Direct Aids Alternative Information Resources, merged with the PWA Health Group, but the organisations have since been superseded by the New York Buyers' Club. Hannan also helped to establish the nonprofit Community Research Initiative (CRI, later renamed CRIA, then ACRIA) in New York in 1987, becoming the organization's administrative director.

Discovery  O. furu was first collected in 2000 during a Conservation International biodiversity survey, and formally described in 2009 by Rainer G√ºnther, Stephen Richards, Burhan Tjaturadi and Djoko Iskandar. It was found in the lowland rainforest ( above sea level) near the Mamberamo River of Western New Guinea. The specific name derives from the Furu River, a small tributary of the Mamberamo River.  Description and behaviour  Length of collected males (from tip of snout to distal tip of urostyle bone) ranged between 20.5 and 23.3 mm, and one female was 24.7 mm. The dorsal and lateral sides are pale grey with variously scattered dark brown pigmentation, and a whitish mask on the snout. The ventral side is whitish and sometimes speckled with dark dots. A male was observed guarding eggs glued to the underside of a leaf by straddling them, probably to provide moisture and avoid egg desiccation. This behaviour has been observed in only one other (undescribed) Oreophryne species. It advertises for mates with an infrequent, loud, harsh rattle that lasts about two seconds.  Habitat  Oreophryne furu is known from lowland rainforest adjacent to a river. Calling males were found at night in vegetation above the ground. The female and the egg-guarding male were on the forest floor.

The house was built in 1867 - one of the first projects of Architect Felix Roxas y Arroyo. Some of his notable works were Paterno House and Zamora House in Quiapo, Manila and the 1867 Santo Domingo Church in Intramuros, Manila. However, a carving on king post, stating \\"1807\\", indicates that the house was built before Rafael Enriquez occupied the house. This was discovered in 2006 - wherein the house was dismantled and relocated at Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar, Bagac, Bataan. History The Rafael Enriquez House was originally located at the corner of R. Hidalgo Street (formerly Calle San Sebastian) and Callejon Carcer Street at Quiapo, Manila. It was referred as the home of the Enriquez family, descendants of Spanish immigrants who arrived in early 1800s, then settled in Bicol. The house was designed by Architect Felix Roxas y Arroyo (1823-1887). He belonged to an influential clan, or buena familia, in Manila. He acquired academic training at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando in Madrid, Spain. One of his works was San Ignacio Church, which metal frameworks were designed and supplied by French engineer, Gustave Eiffel. His company in Manila was represented by Jacobo Zobel, Architect Roxas' nephew-in-law. University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts Rafael Enriquez was born at Nueva Caceres (Naga at present) in 1850. He studied at the University of Santo Tomas and got painting courses at Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando. He moved to Paris in 1879, to London in 1887, and returned to Manila in 1896. He became professor; thus, becoming the first director of the School of Fine Arts at the University of the Philippines in 1909. He served as its director for 17 years until his death in 1937. The house held classes until 1926, when it moved to its own building on the U.P. campus on Taft Avenue and Padre Faura Street (now the Supreme Court of the Philippines). Some of its alumni while it was at the original Enriquez house were Fabi√°n de la Rosa, Fernando Amorsolo, and Guillermo Tolentino. Architectural features The house resembles a Spanish Colonial architectural style. Its ground floor was made of large adobe stones while the second floor was made of hardwood. The lower part of the house consists of series of adobe posts with Ionic columns covering the sidewalk in front of it. The arcaded sidewalk was caused by a mandate from the city government of Manila after the 1863 earthquake. This feature was also reflected on structures built along San Fernando street in Binondo, San Sebastian (now R. Hidalgo street) in Quiapo and Calzada de Iris (part of the present C.M. Recto) in Sampaloc. The central bay of the ground floor is a carriage way, leading to stables at the rear. About halfway in were the main stairs leading up to a landing and hen doubling back. Both sides of it were mezzanines, or entresuelo, partly elevated rooms used before as offices, servant's quarters, and storage rooms. Eventually, these spaces became sculpture area, classrooms, and studios when the structure became a school. Beside the main staircase were to two principal drawing rooms, gallery, or loggia, and living rooms on the ground floor. The staircase has double Ionic pillars in gold paint finish - same with the gallery, which contains 8 Ionic shafts. The gallery was enclosed; with seven capiz windows. The flooring of the ground floor was made out of native marble tiles. A second sala, smaller than the gallery, opens up to a series of drawing rooms inside. On the second floor was the foyer, or caida, connecting the main corridor above the carriageway. The main sala, overlooking the street, was located on the one side while a terrace, or azotea, was located on the other end of the corridor. Bedrooms are situated on both sides of the corridor. An aljibe or cistern serves as rainwater collector from the roofs. Present condition Despite surviving the World War II, the house was vacated by its owners, selling it during the 1970s. The ground floor became commercial establishments while the large rooms of the second floor were partitioned into lodgings. Also, it housed a panciteria, a dormitory, a bowling alley, and a movie theater. Later owners sold it to Jose L. Acuzar, chairman of New San Jose Builders, Inc., who transferred it to Bagac, Bataan. Restoration of the Rafael Enriquez House The original architectural plans were missing; thus, the restoration of the house was conducted by analyzing its existing state. Its layout was similar to mansions within Manila such as the Goldenberg and Teus houses in San Miguel. The rear of the house had been destroyed by fire and the surviving front half was occupied by numerous families and shops before the restoration work. The following were conducted during the restoration process: replaced wooden floor planks; patched walls and ceilings; removal of the grand staircase, relocated into the former driveway and constructed one steep flight out of lower-grade wood; division of large spaces into rooms at the second floor with 8-foot high lawanit panels; scraping of excess paint layers at the Ionic capitals; and removal of later additions of tile and cement at the granite blocks, or piedra china, at the ground level References External links  Escuela de BellasArtes page at Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar site Category:Historic house museums in the Philippines Category:Former buildings and structures in Manila Category:Buildings and structures in Bataan ","title":"Casa Hidalgo"},{"id":"44932462","text":"Giovanni Benedetto Paolazzi (1700‚Äì1788) was an Italian painter of the late- Baroque period, active in Bologna, mainly in ornamental and quadratura painting.

Among them highlighted Alfredo Bra√±as, Salvador Cabeza de Le√≥n, Jos√© Tarr√≠o and Juan Barcia Caballero. In 1891 local committees were created in Lugo, A Coru√±a, Ourense, Pontevedra and Tui formed. In total there was never more than 50 members, being the ARG relatively elitist. In the municipal elections of Santiago de Compostela in 1891, Jose Tarr√≠o and Salvador Cabeza de Le√≥n were elected town councillors, the first galicianist politicians to be elected to public office in the history of Galicia. La Patria Gallega (1891-1892) was the official organ of the ARG, directed by Manuel Murgu√≠a, and that had a lot of impact in the evolution of galicianist. The most famous action of the ARG was organization of the Floral Games of Tui in 1891, in which Murgu√≠a and Alfredo Bra√±as used the Galician language for the first since the 16th Century at a public event. Some people of the ARG (including Murgu√≠a) also started considering Galicia as a nation, not just a region of Spain, clearing the way for the emergence of modern Galician nationalism. The differences between traditionalists and liberals impeded the consolidation of the organization, although it was very important in the formation of a Galician national sentiment, as the first regionalist political organization that existed in Galicia.Manuel Murgu√≠a had already defended the national character of Galicia in some articles since 1886.

Description The short signal booklet was printed with water-soluble red ink on pink blotting paper, in order to be able to destroy it quickly in case of danger. The transmission of radio messages had the potential risks of revealing the submarine's presence and direction; if decoded the content was also revealed. Submarines need to provide information, mostly in standard form (position of convoy to attack and of submarine, weather information), to their bases. Initially Morse code transmissions could be used. To inhibit detection, the duration of messages needed to be minimised; for this, Kurzsignale short-coding was used. To prevent interception, messages needed to be encrypted by the Enigma machine. To shorten transmission even further, the message could be sent by a fast machine instead of a human radio operator. For example, the Kurier system ‚Äì not implemented in time ‚Äì decreased the time to send a Morse dot from around 50 milliseconds for a human to 1 millisecond. Short Signal book The Kurzsignale code was intended to shorten transmission time to below the time required to get a directional fix. It was not primarily intended to hide signal contents; protection was intended to be achieved by encoding with the Enigma machine. A copy of the Kurzsignale code book was captured from on 9 May 1941. In August 1941, D√∂nitz began addressing U-boats by the names of their commanders, instead of boat numbers. The method of defining U-boat meeting points in the Short Signal Book was regarded as compromised, so a method was defined by B-Dienst cryptanalysts to disguise their positions on the Kriegsmarine German Naval Grid System (German:Gradnetzmeldeverfahren) was introduced and used until the end of the war Radio direction finding Aware of the danger presented by radio direction finding (RDF), the Kriegsmarine developed various systems to speed up broadcast. The Kurzsignale code system condensed messages into short codes consisting of short sequences for common terms such as \\"convoy location\\" so that additional descriptions would not be needed in the message. The resulting Kurzsignal was then encoded with the Enigma machine and subsequently transmitted as rapidly as possible, typically taking about 20 seconds. Typical length of an information or weather signal was about 25 characters. Conventional RDF needed about a minute to fix the bearing of a radio signal, and the Kurzsignale protected against this. However, the huff-duff system which was in use by the Allies could cope with these short transmissions. The fully automated burst transmission Kurier system, in testing from August 1944, could send a Kurzsignal in not more than 460 milliseconds; this was short enough to prevent location even by huff-duff and, if deployed, would have been a serious setback for Allied anti-submarine and code-breaking activities. By late 1944 the Kurier program was a top priority, but the war ended before the system was operational.Aircraft of World War II: thread August 19, 1942 Short Weather cipher A similar coding system was used for weather reports from U-boats, the Wetterkurzschl√ºssel (Short Weather Cipher). Code books were captured from on 30 October 1942.

The expedition, personally led by Sebastian de Corcuera, the then Governor-General of the Spanish East Indies was a follow-up expedition to the earlier successful campaigns against the Maguindanao Sultanate under Sultan Qudarat. It was initially successful, partly due to an epidemic within the Sultan Wasit's fort early in the campaign, resulting in the Sulu forces retreating to Tawi-Tawi. The occupation of Jolo also saw the installment of a short-lived Spanish garrison in the town. Later on, Sultan Wasit and Sultan Nasir ud-Din, who many believe to be Sultan Qudarat, began a series of expeditions against the Spaniards, successfully diminishing the garrison until they were called back to Manila in defense against a rumored attack by Chinese pirate Koxinga. After the occupation, a short period of peace followed, with no significant attacks made on Mindanao or Sulu. Corcuera's occupation was the first prolonged Spanish occupation of Jolo from 1638 to 1645.  Background  The new Governor- General of the Philippines at the time, Governor Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera intended to pacify the Moros of Mindanao once and for all, in order to consolidate and strengthen Spanish hold on the archipelago.https://filipinoscribbles.wordpress.com/tag/sebastian-hurtado-de- corcuera/ This led to an initial Spanish invasion of Basilan, then known as Taguima, and a successful attack on Sultan Qudarat's base in Lamitanhttp://www.bayaniart.com/sultan-kudarat in 1636. Qudarat (sometimes spelled Kudarat) then focused on gathering support from the Maguindanao interior, regrouping for another attack, while dealing with the Spaniards diplomatically. After signing an agreement with Qudarat, a short interlude of 2 years occurred before Corcuera set out to Bauang, the then capital of the Sulu Sultanate, known to Spaniards as Jolo.http://www.zamboanga.com/html/Body_PHOTOS/tourist_sulu_archipelago.htm Meanwhile, within the walls of the Kuta or Fort of the Sultan Muwallil Wasit, known to the Spanish as Rajah Bungsu, news of the expeditionary force came just in time to make for preparations for the impending assault. Sultan Wasit called for all the Datu of Sulu along with allies from Borneo and Makassar to strengthen his Kuta. By the time the Spaniards sighted Jolo on 3 January, prior to making the attack, Wasit's Kuta boasted 4,000 troops and innumerable artillery pieces ready to repel the Spanish assault like it had done on numerous occasions before. Wasit also entered into an agreement with Maguindanao Sultan Kudarat to have an arranged marriagehttp://kahimyang.info/kauswagan/articles/759/sultan-kudarat-a- mindanao-hero-mindanaos-most-powerful-ruler between one of Sultan Wasit's daughters and Kudarat. The importance of the resulting marriage and alliance will be discussed further later. The battle  Spanish Assaults  On January 4, 1638, the Spaniards landed on the beach near Jolo and staged their first assault on the fortress, with Corcuera himself leading the troops.https://filipinoscribbles.wordpress.com/tag/sebastian-hurtado-de- corcuera/ Though the force came with much fury and with better arms compared to those in the fort, the attacks were repulsed. Bombardment of the fort continued for weeks after the initial assault, with the Sulus obstinate and holed up within the fort, while the Spanish-Filipino force regrouped on their ships. Another attack was led by Corcuera and the Sulus remained resistant. With either side gaining any ground, and the current siege situation favoring the Sultan, who had a steady supply of food from the interior of the island, a period of stalemate ensued.  Stalemate and Outbreak of disease in Jolo  After nearly 3 months of stalemate in Jolo, with neither side gaining or losing ground, and both sides suffering mounting casualties, it looked as though the Sulus had once again repelled the assault on their capital. But soon, a mysterious disease, described as a \\"tropical disease\\" http://www.seasite.niu.edu/tagalog/Modules/Modules/MuslimMindanao/historical_timeline_of_the_royal.htm (presumed to be Malaria) entered the fort and ravaged its defenders. Many Sulus died from the sudden epidemic, and eventually, Sultan Wasit called for a retreat, abandoning the fort and the town and sailing to Dungun, Tawi-Tawi in the southernmost reach of the Sultanate. The Spaniards later occupied the town and fought off the remaining resistance in the fort, establishing a garrison within the town and reconstructing its Kutas and fortifications.  Counter attack by Sultan Wasit  After the initial triumph of the Spaniards in Jolo, Sultan Wasit was faced with a humiliating defeat at the hands of de Corcuera. Initial assaults on the town of Jolo were conducted by the Sulu Datus who were left behind, under the command of Wasit himself. However, no major assault occurred until presumably 1640. Regrouping and calling for reinforcements from Tawi-Tawi, he organized a counter-offensive http://www.seasite.niu.edu/tagalog/Modules/Modules/MuslimMindanao/historical_timeline_of_the_royal.htm to drive the Spaniards out of his domains. However, he was not to directly lead this assault. The Datus of Sulu were now to be led by the Sultan's son, Pangiran Salikula. It was around this time that Salikula was named de facto Sultan of Sulu, due to his father's old age. It would take another 5 years of conflict before the Spaniards would agree to a treaty, and finally leave Jolo.  Battle of Bud Datu  The bulk of Wasit's army now consisted of the forces of his Datus, and the Datus of Tawi-Tawi, his Bornean and Makassarian allies either killed or captured. The fate of Jolo rested on the armies of the Datus and Sultan's army. The initial counterattack ended up pushing the front line to the mountain of Bud Datu, overlooking the then Spanish town of Jolo. for many months, the Datus of Sulu began fighting a bloody war in the jungles at the foot of the mountain, it became another stalemate for a while. Soon, the battle began favoring the Sulus, as the garrison of the Spaniards was continually depleted, and Corcuera was absent at this time, attending to duties in Manila. Wasit was also no longer leading the Datus in battle, he was considered old and his son was entrusted with the command on the assault.http://www.seasite.niu.edu/tagalog/Modules/Modules/MuslimMindanao/historical_timeline_of_the_royal.htm It is unclear how long this battle lasted, or how severe the casualties on either sides were, what is widely believed, however, is that Sultan Wasit ordered that the Mountain overlooking Jolo, was to be named \\"Bud Datu\\" meaning \\"Mountain of the Datu\\" to commemorate the sacrifice of the Datus of Sulu in their long fight with the Spaniards.http://www.seasite.niu.edu/tagalog/Modules/Modules/MuslimMindanao/historical_timeline_of_the_royal.htm The Datus of Sulu hunkered down and built their Kutas on the Mountain's slopes, in order to consolidate their minor gains.  Dutch involvement  On March 25, 1644, Wasit dispatched his Son, Pangiran Salikula, along with a Dutch fleet from Batavia to bombard the remaining Spaniards in the Jolo garrison.http://www.seasite.niu.edu/tagalog/Modules/Modules/MuslimMindanao/historical_timeline_of_the_royal.htm No decisive land battle occurred during this period, and the Dutch presumably had no further involvement with the Sulu Sultan afterwards. A period of relative peace once again ensued in Jolo, as the garrison was now cut off from reinforcements and virtually surrounded.  Final Sulu assault and destruction of Jolo garrison  Some time in 1645, the combined forces of Pangiran Salikula, the acting Sultan of Sulu and a certain Sultan Nasir ud- Din, who many believe to be Sultan Kudarat, led a final assault on the garrison, killing and capturing the remaining Spanish forces there and finally occupying Jolo.  Sultan Kudarat involvement  It is unclear what occurred between the Sulu reconquest of Jolo and the final treaty signed with Manila and Sulu. It is believed, however, that due to an earlier marriage agreement with Qudarat, or Nasir ud-Din, his presumed name in Sulu,http://www.bayaniart.com/sultan-kudarat Salikula would not continue to rule as de facto Sultan, or even reign as full Sultan in fact. Rather, Wasit is believed to have given the throne of Sulu to Nasir ud-Din as a gesture of gratitude and of obligation, as Nasir ud-Din was his son-in-law, due to an earlier marriage agreement between Sultan Wasit's daughter and Sultan Qudarat. Sultan Qudarat was officially crowned Sulu Sultan Nasir ud-Din in Bauang or Jolo, sometime in late 1645, while Salikula and Wasit remained in Tawi-Tawi. On April 14, 1646, The Manila Spanish government signed a peace treaty with Sulu Sulta Nasir ud-Din recognizing the Sultanate's continuing independence from Spain, his sovereign rights to extend up to the Tawi-Tawi Group as far as Tup-Tup and Balabac islands in Palawan, and his monopoly on Maguindanao-Sulu- Borneo trade.http://www.seasite.niu.edu/tagalog/Modules/Modules/MuslimMindanao/historical_timeline_of_the_royal.htmhttp://kahimyang.info/kauswagan/articles/759/sultan- kudarat-a-mindanao-hero-mindanaos-most-powerful-ruler Sultan Nasir ud-Din ruled until 1648, when, after the death of Wasit's son, Salikula (sometimes spelled Sarikula) Wasit asserted his right to rule as Sultan once more, and Nasir ud-Din was asked to step down from the throne. However, Sultan Muwallil Wasit's second reign would be short lived, as he died around 1649 or 1650, giving way to his son, Pangiran Bakhtiar to become Sultan.  Aftermath and Legacy  Mindanao and Sulu would never be the same after de Corcuera stepped in, in his bid to pacify and unite the Philippine islands into a single nation-colony of Spain. His involvement in the Maguindanao interior led Qudarat and other Datus of Mindanao to begin regrouping and forming into a bigger political entity. For the first time in history, the Sultanate of Maguindanao could be recognized as an Islamic state https://filipinoscribbles.wordpress.com/tag/sebastian-hurtado-de-corcuera/ and a united principality, with the combined rule of Buayan, Cotabato-Maguindanao under Qudarat, and the Lanao Sultans to form into one Nation. A few years later, almost all troops in Mindanao were called back to Manila to defend it from an expected attack by the Chinese Pirate Koxinga. This allowed the Sultanates in the south to regroup and begin mobilizing their armies, as they were now undisturbed, due to the absence and abandonment of numerous forts, particularly that of Zamboanga. The attack by Koxinga never came and Mindanao experienced a period of relative peace and stability marked by increased trade and production, as well as military mobilization. The impact on Sulu was also significant. Despite a long occupation of Jolo, and the epidemic that caused it, the Sultanate's prestige would grow as trade continued and Monopoly consolidated with the trade with Borneo and the Dutch. New wealth came pouring in and the Sultanate would eventually reach its apogee in the 18th century. However, the impact was also a negative one for Sulu, the war had damaged the main island's fields and a shortage of rice was evident, a problem Sulu would face well into the 19th century and beyond. Jolo may have been recaptured, but the Sultan and his court would not see Jolo again until the 1736 when the Court would be moved to Jolo from Tawi-Tawi. The impact it had of the leaders of the war would also be profound. Sultan Muwallil Wasit was humiliated by his defeat by Corcuera and was never truly redeemed until his Son Sarikula fought off the Spaniards. He is remembered as a valiant hero of Sulu. Salikula, the rightful heir to the throne of Sulu ruled for a mere 4 and a half years as a de facto Sultan, never truly experiencing powers of the full Sultan.http://www.seasite.niu.edu/tagalog/Modules/Modules/MuslimMindanao/historical_timeline_of_the_royal.htm Sultan Qudarat would remain defiant against the Spaniards and would continue raiding the coasts of the Spanish Philippines, until his death at the age of 90, having ruled as Sultan of almost all of Mindanao, and as Sultan of Sulu. Sebastian de Corcuera would not be welcomed as a hero in Manila, for he had made numerous enemies, particularly in the church, and his reputation as one of the most innovative and successful governors of the Philippines was soon erased from memory by the church, and his term ended in 1644.https://filipinoscribbles.wordpress.com/tag/sebastian-hurtado-de- corcuera/ His career and campaigns in the Moro wars were among the most successful in the entire conflict. He managed to hold onto Jolo for 8 years, the first time in history that Spaniards occupied Jolo for a prolonged period of time. His expeditions to pacify the Moros also gave rise to various comic plays throughout the archipelago, depicting his fights with the Moros, these comical plays would become an integral part of Philippine culture and arts as the \\"Moro-moro\\" or \\"Moros y Cristianos\\". What did not change, however was that almost all the Kingdoms in the south of the Philippines remained independent and strong. Moro Pirates continued to ravage and raid the coasts of the Philippines and no other Spanish military assault would come near the success of Corcuera, until the 19th century.

He also made contributions to the study of tectonics and meteorites. In the 1960s he introduced the concept of paired metamorphic belts. In 1973 Miyashiro challenged the common conceptions of ophiolites and proposed an island arc origin for the famous Troodos Ophiolite in Cyprus. This was done arguing that numerous lavas and dykes in the ophiolite had calc-alkaline chemistries. Personal life and death Miyashiro was a native of Okayama Prefecture.

It was moved to Stigmatomma by Ward & Fisher (2016). Specimens were found in habitats that were forests with considerable amounts of leaf litter and rotting wood materials. Due to the few specimens collected and the fact that the area has been relatively studied, Gu√©nard et al. (2013) ranked the genus as one of the most rare ant genera in the world. However, they could not rule out whether collection techniques, crypsis or subterranean habits (known to occur among ants within the subfamily) biased the frequency of the collections.

The loch is roughly triangular in shape and is shallow with a flat bottom that gradually deepens from west to east. It lies approximately southeast of Kirkwall. Archaeology and history  The remains of a broch stand on a short promontory on the southwest shore. It is thought that the broch is the Howie of the Manse. At the edge of the loch, on the eastern shore, is a burnt mound. Beside the mound is a Bronze Age structure that is presumed to be a house. It is in the form of erect slabs and a slab floor, forming an oval plan. When the loch's water level dropped during the drought of 1980, the house was further exposed and recorded. At that time archaeological artefacts were retrieved from the loch including the point of an early plough. On the eastern shore is a filter room and pump house. It was originally built in the late 19th century and powered by an oil engine. The engine was replaced in the 1940s with a windpump. Wildlife The Greenland white-fronted goose is occasionally seen on the loch. In 1960s 50-100 geese were regularly found there in the winter but there has been a sharp decline in numbers since 1974/75 probably as a result of reclamation of moorland and an increase in shooting in the area. The decline at this site matches an increase in the size of the wintering flock on Stronsay. Survey The loch was surveyed in 1903 by R.C. Marshall and later charted as part of the Sir John Murray's Bathymetrical Survey of Fresh-Water Lochs of Scotland 1897-1909.

Life Nelson was born in London in 1800, son of Solomon Nelson. Showing musical ability when quite young, he was adopted by a gentleman who gave him a good musical and general education. He was for some time a pupil of Sir George Smart, and eventually became a teacher in London. He was in partnership with Charles Jefferys as a music-seller until 1843, when he was elected an associate of the Philharmonic Society. Subsequently he became a music publisher, but, being unsuccessful, he arranged a musical and dramatic entertainment with members of his family, and went on tour in North America, Canada, and Australia. He died in Russell Square, London on 7 April 1862, and was buried at West Ham; he left a widow, Sarah, and son Alfred Nelson. Compositions Nelson was a prolific composer, and claimed to have written about eight hundred pieces, some of which were published under an assumed name. He composed a burletta, The Grenadier, produced by Madame Vestris at the Olympic Theatre; The Cadi's Daughter, performed after Macbeth for William Macready's farewell benefit; and The Village Nightingale, words by Henry Thornton Craven, his son-in-law. He had a grand opera, Ulrica, in rehearsal at the Princess's Theatre, London under John Medex Maddox's management, but, owing to some dispute, it was not produced. He was the author of Instructions in the Art of Singing and composed many duets, trios, piano pieces, and songs; some of the latter, such as \\"The Pilot\\" and \\"Rose of Allendale\\", attained considerable popularity. \\"Mary of Argyle\\" also became popular.\\"Mary of Argyle\\" National Jukebox at Library of Congress.

Be it expressed in press as in weekly satirical newspapers, cartoons, prose, or as in recent times, on online social media platforms, satire in Jordan represents a unique genre that has reflected a local mode and attitude towards local and global issues. While it is not meant entirely to entertain, political satire in Jordan has been used as a way to poke fun at elected governments and their failure to tend to local issues. Like satirists worldwide, the Jordanian satirists aim to use pun and indirect references to tackle taboos, defy the restrictive laws that inhibit the freedom of speech, and convey public grievances. Jordanian early satirists While some might argue that the early accounts of political satire in Jordan can be traced in the works of Jordan's most well-known poet Mustafa Wahbi al-Tal nicknamed ‚ÄòArar‚Äô, as he was cynical of the social life during the formative years of Transjordan, satirical writings in Jordan were only made available to the public in the 1960s.Al-Sijill, Generations that Painted A Smile on the Face of National Frowning, Volume 3, 9/1/2009, retrieved from: http://www.al- sijill.com/mag/sijill_items/sitem34.htm According to rare accounts on the history of the Jordanian political satire as found in the diaries of a Jordanian journalist named Faisal Mohammad Awkal, the writings of Fakhri Qawar were the first satirical accounts published in the old newspaper of Amman in the Evening in Arabic (ÿπŸÖÿßŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≥ÿßÿ°). Qawar's writings included short essays that mainly leveled light criticism at the government.Awkal, Faisal Mohammad,The History of Jordanian Satire, 3/20/2011, retrieved from: http://shartoh.buygoo.net/t845-topic#1416 The newspaper, which inspired the later satirical journalism, came to clash with the Jordanian authorities in 1964, after publishing the diaries of Wasfi al-Tal on the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, followed by the diaries of Ahmad Shukeiri resulting in its final shutdown in 1975.Al-Ra'i newspaper, Arafat Hijazi, A Journalist and a Pioneer, 10/15/2012, retrieved from: http://www.alrai.com/article/545355.html Later in early 1980s, Qawar published the first satirical works including Farhan Farah Sae‚Äôed's Diaries (which was adapted as a script for a soap-opera that had the same name mid-1980s), published in 1982, and ‚ÄúI am the Patriarch,‚Äù published in 1981.Adab, Arab Poetry Diwan, Qawar‚Äôs Profile Page, retrieved from: http://www.adab.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa;=showpage&pid;=1 Development of satire in 1980s Political satire in Jordan started to develop in the 1980s in the writings of Mohammad Tomaliah, who introduced new elements to the genre in his column in Ad-Dustour, entitled ‚ÄúEyewitness‚Äù. He employed a narrative style borrowed from prose using simplistic realism, cynical discrepancies, and a wide array of unusual similes.Iyad Nasser, Awarq Thakafiya, 1/1/2009, retrieved from: http://inassar.blogspot.com/2009/01/blog- post.html. Moreover, Tomaliah used brief sentences that drew clear images of reality and candid portrayals, allowing Jordanian specificities to stand out. He was unconventional and his articles were free of flowery language and clich√©s. According to critics, Tomaliah was a literary figure and not only a columnist.Al-Shuqairi, Musa, In memory of Tomaliah: Discussion of Three Excerpts, 7ber.me, 10/13/2013, retrieved from: http://www.7iber.me/2013/10/tummaleihtribute/ In one of his articles, 'The Third Bullet\\", Tomaliah talks about his life saying: \\"I personally have not lived yet, and my life is not yet worthy to write about: All my experiences are trivial although I consider growing up in the southern villages and moving during my adolescence years to live in \\"Al-Hussein Camp\\" an experience that gave me a special status: on one hand I am a Jordanian of a Palestinian descent, while on the other, I am Palestinian from a Jordanian origin. Therefore, I frame my political stance within this experience, more specifically within the \\"Catholic\\" relationship that govern the two peoples.

Talking about the marginalized groups, Tomaliah breached the norms of the Jordanian journalism, which was formal and conservative when tackling social issues. Tomaliah did what many Jordanian writers would not have done at the time; namely criticizing the society, its norms, its traditions and even himself. It is widely argued among Jordanian critics that Tomaliah's satirical writings and the way they were received encouraged more Jordanian daily newspapers to assign a space for this genre.Shabanah, Omar,Jordan: Satire Gains Popularity by Breaking Taboos, Al- Araby Al-Jadid, 6/18/2014, retrieved from: http://www.alaraby.co.uk/miscellaneous/ef9f2aa0-f450-44ef-a81b-ec3eceabe5f8 In addition to Tomaliah's column, other satire appeared in the Jordanian satirical newspaper of Shihan (newspaper), founded in 1984.

Both Hisham Yanes and Nabil Sawalha used symbolism and implicit language, which at times lacked clarity, when referring to sensitive issues.

For instance, Ahmad Hasan Al Zoubi, who writes for Al Ra'i newspaper, has gained fame for his sarcastic writings that have attracted the attention of Jordanians. His style can be best characterized as simple but indirect, hiding bitter criticism of the political, economic and social scene in the country.Awadat, Ibtisam, Cynical writers that make you laugh and cry, Al Bawaba, 8/25/2008, retrieved from: http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Cynical+writers+make+you+laugh+and+cry.-a0184359357 In one of Al Zoubi's most famous articles that raised awareness on a local issue that has not yet been resolved, Jordanians found a voice of reason that employed simple language with a cynical tone to address a serious topic: The establishment of a nuclear reactor. In an article titled \\"Why do we reject the nuclear reactor?\\", Al Zoubi refutes the government's narrative on the guaranteed success of the nuclear reactor as a new energy source. He addresses the officials in charge of project by simply telling them that Jordanians do not have faith in them. Al Zoubi refers to the statements of president of the Jordan Atomic Energy Commission defending the scheme and trying to assure Jordanians that what happened to Japan's nuclear reactor of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant cannot happen in Jordan as it was a ‚ÄòJapanese‚Äô administrative mistake. Al Zoubi cunningly argues that if the Japanese given their long expertise in the field committed mistakes, why would Jordanians, given their zero experience, be immune?

In his book, which takes the form of short articles and stories, Tomaliah alludes to local and Arab political failures. In one of the book's articles titled ‚ÄúFig Leaf‚Äù, Tomaliah reduces the vast areas of the Arab lands to a fig leaf that does not hide the Arab countries' defects. He critiques the fake borders that separate the 'one Arab homeland' as ones that result in 'border' grudges that disturb the brotherly ties, adding that: \\"The borders are often located in the desert, which in case of chaos, issues such as \\"sovereignty\\", expulsion of ambassadors, closure of checkpoints and demands to re-draft borders result in the arrival of scientists wearing khaki shorts and caps accompanied by beautiful women on top of Jeep cars. Those who drafted the borders in the past come from all over to draw them again.

The genus contains four species dating from the Eocene to Miocene, Casaleia eocenica, Casaleia inversa, Casaleia longiventris, Casaleia orientalis.  History and classification  The species placed in Casaleia have a varied history, with the type species Casaleia inversa originally described by Gennady Dlussky in 1981 as \\"Protamblyopone\\" inversa. The fossil was recovered from Middle Miocene age sediments exposed in the Chon-Tyz mine, Naryn Region, Kyrgyzstan. However \\"Protamblyopone\\" was already used by William Morton Wheeler as a subgenus of Amblyopone. To correct the homonym status, the species was moved to the new genus Casaleia by Pagliano and Scaramozzino in a 1990 paper. The second species in the genus, C. eocenica, is of Lutetian age, and was recovered as a solitary compression-impression fossil preserved in a layer of soft sedimentary rock. Along with other well preserved insect fossils, the C. eocenica specimen was collected from layers of the Lutetian Messel pit World Heritage Site. The formation is composed of brown coals, oil shales, and bituminous shale, which preserved numerous insects, fish, birds, reptiles, and terrestrial mammals as a notable lagerst√§tten. The area is a preserved maar lake which initially formed approximately 47 million years ago as the result of volcanic explosions. The fossil was described by Dlussky and Sonja Wedmann in a 2012 paper on the poneromorph ants of Messel. The specific epithet \\"eocenica\\" is derived from the Eocene age of the fossil. At the time of description, the fossil was preserved in the collections of the Forschungsstation Grube Messel as number FIS MeI 5565. C. longiventris was originally described 132 years before C. inversa and the erection of a new genus for the species. The species was based on a group of seven separate fossil ants, which were preserved as compression fossils in sedimentary rock from the Radoboj area of what is now Croatia. The deposits are the result of sedimentation in an inland sea basin, possibly a shallow lagoon environment, during the Burdigalian of the Early Miocene. The fossil impressions are preserved in micrite limestones, resulting in low quality preservation of fine details. The fossils were first studied by Oswald Heer, then a professor with the University of Z√ºrich, who placed the fossils into the genus Formica as F. longiventris in 1849. This placement was not changed until a re-examination of two of Heers type specimens was published in 2014. Examination by Dlussky and Putyatina of two of Heers \\"syntypes\\" resulted in the removal of the species from Formica and placement into Casaleia. Of the two specimens, one was designated lectotype for the species, while the second was determined not to belong to the genus. C. orientalis was described in 2015 from a single holotype gyne missing its head. The fossil was recovered from the late Eocene Bol‚Äôshaya Svetlovodnaya fossil site, in the Sikhote-Alin area of far-eastern Russia. The type specimen numbered PIN 3429/1174 is currently preserved in the A.A. Borissiak Paleontological Institute fossil collections of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The Bol‚Äôshaya Svetlovodnaya site preserves diatomaceous sediments from a small lake which existed near an active volcanic center. The diatomites have been grouped as either the Maksimovka formation or Salibez Formation, and the age range for the fossils is varied, ranging from upper Eocene to Upper Oligocene. Dlussky, Rasnitsyn, and Perfilieva opted to treat the fossil age as that of probably Priabonian. They coined the specific epithet from the Latin \\"orientalis\\", meaning \\"eastern\\", in reference to the type locality. C. longiventris lectotype Description In all three species the broad abdomen rests against the thorax with a single node petiole connecting. The eyes are sometimes not present on worker caste individuals, but in all castes where they are present they are placed just behind the mid length of the head capsule. In the known gynes the antennae are twelve segments and geniculate in structure, while the mandibles are triangular. C. eocenica The type fossil for C. eocenica is a winged female gyne that was preserved as a dorsal imprint in the matrix. Overall the body length as preserved is with fore-wings that are long. The eyes are placed nearly at the midpoint of the head which is a little longer than its width. The antennae differ from C. inversa by having a scape which extends beyond the back corner of the head. The fore-wings have a vein structure that has resulted in closed cells 1 + 2r, 3r, rm and mcu. C. inversa C. inversa is medium length for the genus, being . C. longiventris The largest of the species, C. longiventris has a body length of , and a hind-wing length of . The mesosoma is elongated compared to the other two species and additionally separating the three. Neither the antennae or the fore-wings are preserved on the single examined lectotype. C. orientalis The single fossil is incomplete, but estimates give the length of . The front are of the mesosoma has a convex outline in profile. Due to the preservation positioning of the gyne, comparison to the other species was not possible.

Life and work  Booker received his secondary education at the Sandown Secondary School at the Isle of Wight, and sequentially attended the Royal Naval Artificers Training Establishment, Torpoint at Cornwall. From 1940 to 1954 he served at the Royal Navy, where he worked in the Ordnance department. He started on gun mountings, and later worked in gunnery fire control equipment on ships, in workshops and in the drawing office. In 1954 he became Assistant Secretary at the Institution of Engineering Designers,and was representative of the Institute on the City St Guilds Advisory Committee on Mechanical Engineering Drawing. Brooker became editor of The Engineering Designer, and member of the Newcomen Society.The Chartered Mechanical Engineer: The Journal of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Vol. 10. The Institution, 1954. p. 429. In the 1950s and 1960s Brooker published most of his work on engineering drawing and its history. He received several rewards for his work, among them the Founder Column awarded by the Institution of Engineering Designers.F. P. Kennett (1964). The Engineering Designer. p. 307 He continued to work at the Institution of Engineering Designers,New Scientist, Vol. 9, nr. 223 (23 Feb 1961). p. 489. and in the year 1992‚Äì93 was elected director of the Institute for one year.  Work   A history of engineering drawing, 1963  In a 1965 review of A history of engineering drawing Chilton summarised the intention of this work: :... Booker is mostly concerned with engineering drawing in this history, and in particular of communication via the representation of three-dimensional objects on a two- dimensional surface; a means of communication, that is between the designer and constructor, since this particular communication must convey not only the qualitative aspects of the design but also provide the detailed dimensions that are ultimately necessary before the design be realised. This work is regarded the standard history of engineering drawing.Carl Mitcham (1994). Thinking Through Technology: The Path Between Engineering and Philosophy. p. 338. Its first chapters deal with: :# Introducing shadows and projection :# The fundamental nature of drawing :# Representing attributes in drawings :# Perspective: projection applied to pictures :# Plans and multi-view drawings :# Constructional drawings: sun-dialling and stone-cutting :# Ships and Forts: Water‚Äêlines, and Figured Plans, and :# Plans and Multi‚Äêview Drawings...Brooker (1965, content) Another 1978 review revealed more of the content: :\\"Other specific chapter headings include... 'The American Scene: Third Angle Projection' (and the divergences between the UK and European 'first angle' projection and the US and Canadian 'third quadrant' projection), 'Descartes: Linking Geometry and Algebra'... In a chapter entitled 'Conventions and Standards in Drawing', it seems that although textbooks had done much to unify drawing practice, the war years 1914‚Äì18 highlighted the inherent difficulties in nonstandard drawing practices. As is usual in time of war concerted efforts were made to improve the situation so that shortly afterwards British Standard Drawing Office Practice first appeared. The techniques of sun-dialling and stone-cutting drawing also warrant separate treatment in that these two areas required solutions to three-dimensional problems, detailed examples of which are fully set out and explained.\\"F. P. Kennett (1978), The Engineering Designer, Volumes 4‚Äì6, 1978, p. 454 The second 1979 edition of this work was enlarged and revised and contained 19 chapters.Institution of Engineers (India) (1980), Bulletin of the Institution of Engineers (India). Vol. 30. 1980. p. 20  Pioneers of engineering drawing  In A history of engineering drawing, Brooker (1963) goes more into details about the live, work and accomplishments of engineering designers. Brooker, for example, explained that: :\\"... as early pictures were primarily concerned with events, stories or actions, and depicted people, the Greeks although sophisticated in geometry did not develop perspective projection simply because there was no motivation to do so! The first principles of projection, in fact, are credited to the Florentine goldsmith turned painter and sculptor born Paulo di Dono in 1397. but more popularly known as Paolo Uccello. Later artists of the 15th and 16th centuries used and modified his ideas in developing their own methods. About this period several mathematicians and experimenters began to study perspective on a scientific basis, and indeed worked examples of the science which we now know as photogrammetry developed early in this century to elucidate true information from photographs, ie to work perspective 'backwards'. The 1978 review of this work also stipulated, that: :\\"... there are copious illustrations from the works not only of these early pioneers, but throughout the entire book and including computer-drawn 'drafting feasibility studies' based on what we call today 'computational geometry' but actually derived from the analytical geometry of the great French geometrician Gaspard Monge born in 1746 near Dijon, and to whose work a whole chapter is devoted. Another pioneer and contemporary of Monge, the Englishman the Rev William Farish has a chapter to himself which describes his investigations and development of isometric drawing.\\"  Primary and secondary geometry  In his 1963 A history of engineering drawing Booker made the distinction between primary and secondary geometry.John Willats (1997). Art and Representation: New Principles in the Analysis of Pictures. p. 10. As Riley (2010) explained: :[Primary geometry is] the arrangement in space of lines of projection from a 3-D object to a plane of projection, and secondary geometry, the relationships between the points, lines and shapes of the drawn projection on a 2-D surface.Riley, Howard. \\"Drawing as Transformation: From Primary Geometry to Secondary Geometry.\\" XVOL. III Generative Art International conference. Retrieved December. Vol. 12. 2010. Inspired on this distinction John Willats in his 1997 Art and Representation. New Principles in the Analysis of PicturesWillats, John. 1997. Art and Representation. New Principles in the Analysis of Pictures. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. defined projection systems in terms of primary and secondary geometry. Pascal lef√®vre (2006) explained: :\\"Primary geometry is viewer-centered and describes pictures in terms of projection rays: \\"The geometry of projection of lines or rays from objects in the scene and their intersection with the picture plane to form an image or picture.\\" (Willats, 1997:369). Most technical drawings can be described by primary geometry, but other formal projection systems as the reversed perspective can not be described by primary geometry. In those cases an object-centered system is needed, like secondary geometry, which Willats (1997:369) like Booker (1963) defines as: \\"The two-dimensional geometry of the picture surface, obtained without recourse to the idea of projection.\\"Pascal lef√®vre. \\"The construction of space in comics.\\" In: Jeet Heer, Kent Worcester ed.

As a racehorse, he won one minor race from seven starts. He was then retired to stud and sired the winners of many minor races. Background Kentucky Gold was a bay horse bred in Kentucky by Leslie Combs II of Spendhrift Farm. Having been sired by Raise A Native out of the mare Gold Digger he was a full-brother to Mr. Prospector. At the Keeneland Sales in July 1974 the yearling was sold for a then world-recond price of $625,000, with Mr & Mrs W Gilroy of Chicago winning the auction. He broke the record set a year earlier by Wajima. He was the fifth Spendthrift graduate to hold the record following One Bold Bid, Bold Discovery, Majestic Prince and Crowned Prince. Racing career Kentucky Gold was sent into training with Richard J. Fischer. His racing career consisted of seven starts as a three-year-old in 1976. After finishing third at Hollywood Park Racetrack on his debut in a maiden race in April he finished unplaced in two similar events at the same track before winning a maiden at Delaware Park on August 15. He then finished fourth at Keystone Park and finished third in two allowance races at Keeneland in October. Stud record Kentucky Gold was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion. He was not particularly successful, but did sire some prolific winners of minor races in North America including Golden Tumiga (twenty-six wins), Native of Kentucky (twenty-one wins), Golden Occasion (thirteen wins) and Fort Worth (thirteen wins).

It was created to replace the aging BeZillaBrowser with a WebKit-based browser. Origin One part of its name is a tip of the hat to BeOS' simple NetPositive, while the other points to its modern foundation: WebKit, the open source browser engine at the heart of many other mainstream browsers, like Apple's Safari. By making use of WebKit as its engine, WebPositive is able to keep up with the latest web technologies. History In the Google Summer of Code 2009, Maxime Simon, mentored by Ryan Leavengood, was commissioned to work on a WebKit port for Haiku, initiated by the work Leavengood had done for a bounty on the Haikuware website. This led to the development of the HaikuLauncher prototype browser, which demonstrated the functionality of the WebKit rendering engine but did little else. In February 2010, Stephan A√ümus took on the task of improving the HaikuLauncher web browser to make it more usable. This led to many preview releases before a relatively stable version (r488) was integrated into Haiku R1 / Alpha 2. In that same year, Ryan Leavengood took over as the lead developer of WebPositive. Earlier versions of WebPositive used cURL services but they were slow and had many other bugs, one of the more serious being that cookies overloaded at times. It became clear that cURL could not be used in WebPositive. In October 2013, Adrien Destugues, also known as PulkoMandy, was contracted to work on WebPositive full-time, which culminated in his assuming project leadership for WebPositive and HaikuWebKit. Destugues replaced cURL as the core of the application with Haiku's Service Kit, a product earlier developed by Stephan A√ümus and Christophe Huriaux during 2010's Google Summer of Code, and Alexandre Deckner in 2011. Destugues has also made significant improvements to WebPositive's HTML5 support in WebKit, such as implementing support for datalists and color input.

He helped to define fashionable hat styles ‚Äì including the bucket hat, pillbox hat and fedora ‚Äì that predominated throughout the 1960s and collaborated with major couture houses. With a career spanning more than 40 years, he remained a favourite hatmaker of Sophia Loren (both for film and personal wear), also creating hats for Michael Jackson's 1988 world tour. Early life and career Jean Barthet was born in Nay, a village in the Pyrenees region of France in 1920 ‚Äì although he would later put his date of birth as 1930/1. After studying at art college in Toulouse, he left for Paris, working for the milliner Gilbert Orcel before setting up his own salon. International reputation Barthet presented his first collection in 1949 and soon attracted an international clientele ‚Äì notable among them were many Hollywood stars. He introduced hat styles that attracted newspaper publicity, including a white felt hat inspired by the Texas sheriff's sombrero and a feminine variation on the fedora. By the early 1960s his clients included Jacqueline Kennedy. By the mid 1960s, such was his client list that the Chicago Tribune said Barthet had: \\"more star quality customers than any Hollywood studio ever had under contract\\". These included names such as Sophia Loren, Natalie Wood, Brigitte Bardot and Princess Grace of Monaco. His collaborations with haute couture houses continued from his early career into the 1980s and he worked with, among others, Andr√© Courr√®ges, Chanel, Claude Montana, Sonia Rykiel, Paco Rabanne and Karl Lagerfeld. He collaborated with another notable milliner, Parisian-born Claude Saint-Cyr, who worked with him from the mid 1960s to her retirement in the early 1970s. Legacy Examples of Barthet's hats are in a number of public collections, including the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 2011, a vintage Barthet hat featured in a Lady Gaga shoot in Vanity Fair. In 2014, reproductions inspired by his original models were created by his son Alexandre Barthet for the biopic Grace of Monaco. Barthet was also a keen photographer and his extensive photo archive includes portraits of musicians, actors and fashion designers ‚Äì some of whom are captured wearing his hat designs.

Aside from time spent in Vienna in 1695, he worked all of his career in Antwerp.Jan Baptist van der Meiren at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life Jan Baptist van der Meiren was born in Antwerp on 15 December 1664. There are no details on his training. He was admitted as a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1685.J.-E. Buschmann, Uitgaven der Maatschappij der Antwerpsche bibliophilen, Volume 23, Vereeniging der Antwerpsche bibliophilen, 1907, p. 545 Despite a lack of documentary evidence, some historians have speculated that he may have visited Italy since his work displays many Italianizing elements.Jan Baptist van der Meiren at Soraya Cartategui 'Mediterranean harbour scene with Turkish merchants loading a caravan'' Aside from time spent in Vienna in 1695, he worked all of his career in Antwerp. He married Catharina Tassaert in 1690. He took on Jasper Broers as a pupil in 1695. When in 1700 he was elected dean of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke, he paid a sum of 300 guilders to be excused from the execution of this charge. Jan Baptist van der Meiren was very successful working in the established Flemish genres and enjoyed the international patronage of prominent collectors such as Elisabeth Farnese.Biography of Jan Baptist van der Meiren at the Museo del Prado site His compositions commanded high prices at the time. The date of his death is not clear but the assumption is that he must have died between 1700 and 1708. If the attribution to van der Meiren of a composition dated 1736 in the collection of the Museum of Western and Oriental Art in Kiev is correct it points to a death date in or after 1736. Work Cavalry battle Jan Baptist van der Meiren painted small landscapes with scenes of Italianised markets and ports in the same vein as Pieter Bout. He also painted cavalry encounters and biblical scenes in exotic landscapes. He occasionally painted the figures in the landscapes of Adriaen Frans Boudewijns. Van der Meiren liked to paint in small format and to use the technique of oil on copper. This medium enhanced the brightness and liveliness of his colours, with strong shades of blue and green, which was typical for the Flemish style. His brushwork is quick and vibrant but lacks creativity. The small-scale format and copper medium that he preferred facilitated the export of his compositions. The Antwerp art dealers Forchondt commissioned him to enliven for the export a number of landscapes by other artists such as Adriaen Frans Boudewyns and Lucas van Uden. Van der Meiren's work influenced other Antwerp painters such as Arnold Frans Rubens and Peter Tillemans.

He is considered the founder of the Russian scientific school of pharmacology.  Biography  Nikolai Kravkov as Professor of the Imperial Military Medical Academy. Circa 1915 Nikolai Kravkov was born a sixth child in the family of a non- commissioned officer Pavel Alexeyevich Kravkov (1826-1910), who served as a senior clerk in the office of the Chief Enlistment Officer of the Ryazan Governorate. According to the family legend, the scientist's mother Evdokia (Avdotia) Ivanovna (1834-1891), before wedding a \\"Kaluga petty bourgeois\\", was an illegitimate daughter of Konstantin Kavelin (1818-1885), a famous Russian historian, jurist and sociologist, one of the ideologists of Russian liberalism during the age of the reforms of Alexander II. In 1876-1884 Nikolai Kravkov attended the First Ryazan Gymnasium. In summer 1884 the future scientist was admitted to the Imperial Saint Petersburg University, where he studied at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics. In his last year at the University Kravkov worked in Ivan Sechenov's laboratory and published two research works on enzymes. In May 1888 he graduated from the University with the grade of candidate in natural science. In 1888-1892 Nikolai Kravkov studied at the Imperial Military Medical Academy. Professor Viktor Pashutin was a special influence on him in that period. Kravkov graduated from the Academy cum laude. The Academic Conference unanimously decided to leave him in the Academy ¬´for finishing three years perfecting courses at public cost as attached to the Military Clinic Hospital being in actual service at the Military Medical Academy. In November 1894 the scientist successfully defended his Doctor's thesis \\"Amyloidosis in animals, caused experimentally\\". The years from 1896 to 1898 Nikolai Kravkov spent in practical trainings in different European countries (Germany, Austria-Hungary, France, Italy and Switzerland). In Berlin he attended the lectures of Hermann Emil Fischer, in Strasbourg he worked in Friedrich von Recklinghausen's laboratory and attended the lectures of Friedrich Goltz. His practical training in the Strasbourg laboratory of Oswald Schmiedeberg, the founder of modern experimental pharmacology, influenced greatly upon his further work. On his return to Russia in 1898 Nikolai Kravkov was elected privatdocent of the Imperial Military Medical Academy. In 1899 he was given a post of Supernumerary Professor of the Pharmacology Chair. In 1904 Kravkov was elected as Professor and headed the Chair until his death. In 1910 the scientist was made Actual Civil Councilor (IV grade of the Table of Ranks). In 1914 Professor Kravkov was elected a Full Member of the Imperial Military Medical Academy. During World War I Nikolai Kravkov was a member of the Technical Committee of the Central Scientific Technical Laboratory of the Ministry of War. In 1914-1915 he carried out a series of experiments with chemical weapon on Luga testing area near Petrograd. In the Soviet times Professor Kravkov went on collaborating with the Laboratory. In 1920 on the recommendation of the Nobel laureate Ivan Pavlov Nikolai Kravkov was elected Corresponding Member of the Academy of Science of Russia. Nikolai Kravkov died on 24 April 1924 in Leningrad and was buried in the cemetery of the Novodevichy Monastery.  ¬´Fundamentals of Pharmacology¬ª  Nikolai Kravkov's \\"Fundamentals of Pharmacology\\" front page. First edition, 1904 In Nikolai Kravkov's first years as head of the Pharmacology Chair the students of the Imperial Military Medical Academy, besides his own lectures, used an obsolete textbook by Vladimir Dybkovsky ¬´Lectures on Pharmacology¬ª and also ¬´Brief Manual of Pharmacology¬ª by David Lavrov, a pharmacologist from Odessa. The students were not satisfied with these educational supplies. The creation of a new up-to-date textbook that would be up to the mark relevant to the Professor Kravkov's exam requirements became a pressing task. The students of the Imperial Military Medical Academy frequently studied by a transcript of their Professor's lectures, arranged in the first years of his teaching. In 1901 this transcript was edited by the students Sozonovich, Ivanov and Lavrov. Nikolai Kravkov didn't know anything about this edition and didn't redact it. From the beginning of his pedagogical activity Nikolai Kravkov felt inclined to enrich the educational textbooks with new data. In 1904-1905 two volumes of his ¬´Fundamentals of Pharmacology¬ª were first published. Soon it became a classical manual for students and physicians. The book was written in fine and plain language, the author suggested a very convenient principle of classification of drugs. ¬´Fundamentals of Pharmacology¬ª clearly exposed experimental proofs of preparations' pharmacodynamics, gave picturesque descriptions of poisoning process, gave clear indications for prescription of medicines. The textbook was illustrated by diagrams, drawings and schemes from Kravkov's laboratory. This book took into account the needs not only of students, but also of the physicians ofdifferent specialties. It may be considered the first guide on clinic pharmacology in Russia. ¬´Fundamentals of Pharmacology¬ª by Professor Kravkov had 14 editions ‚Äî in 1904-1905, 1907, 1909-1910, 1911, 1913, 1915, 1917, 1918, 1925-1927, 1926-1927, 1927, 1927-1928, 1928, 1930-1931 and 1933 (every succeeding edition was rearranged by the author, the last two editions were actualized by Professor Savich). Nikolai Kravkov's book became the fundamental textbook for a few generations of Russian pharmacologists.  Scientific activity  ¬´Problems of general pharmacology occupied a prominent place among Professor Kravkov's works. He studied the relationship between dose and effect of preparations, the combined effect of medicaments, the influence of temperature on pharmacologic effect and tissue adaptation to poisons. He elaborated the teaching on the phasic effect of drugs, showing that this effect depended on the difference between the drug's concentration in the tissue and in the environment. Professor Kravkov was an ardent supporter of the idea of relationship between chemical composition of a substance and its pharmacologic effect. He found in particular that the narcotic effect of aliphatic spirits in the homologous sequence increases with the growth of the number of carbon atoms in their molecules, and that the effect of sugar on the heart depends on its stereo chemical structure. A comparative study of diverse soporifics conducted by Professor Kravkov resulted in materialization of his idea of applying non-volatile somnifacients for general anesthesia. Thus, Professor Kravkov suggested application of Hedonal for intravenous anesthesia, which was immediately tested in clinics, and enjoys general recognition today. Professor Kravkov also suggested using Hedonal in combination with chloroform, which started application of so-called combined anesthesia with volatile and non-volatile or basic narcotics. Professor Kravkov worked out several original methods of vessel perfusion in isolated organs to study their functions. They are applied today at pharmacologic and physiologic laboratories throughout the world. Vessel perfusion in isolated rabbit's ear is used on a wide scale for studying reactions of peripheral vessels to pharmacologic substances. Vessel perfusion of various endocrine glands turned out to be most valuable for studying the glands' functions and the influence of pharmacologic substances on them. Striving to make the conditions of experiments as similar as possible to clinical conditions, Professor Kravkov laid the foundation of a new trend in pharmacology known as pathologic pharmacology. This field of pharmacology studies the peculiarities of drug effect on certain experimentally caused pathologic conditions in animals ‚Äî e.g. atherosclerosis in rabbits, aseptic or infectious inflammations, etc. - and the effect of chemical substances on isolated human heart, kidney or fingers of those who died from an illness or injuries. During the last period of his life Professor Kravkov focused his attention on studying changes in the functions of the endocrine gland entailed by pharmacologic substances. This research greatly promoted the development of clinical endocrinology¬ª.Zakusov V.V. Nikolai Kravkov // International Journal of Neuropharmacology, vol. 4, issue 4, 1965 - pp. 205-206. Nikolai Kravkov's scientific heritage includes 47 main works. His disciples carried out nearly 200 researches including dozens of original thesis of great importance to science and practice. Kravkov's fundamental discoveries in pharmacology enriched Russian and world science, contributed to the development of biology, physiology and pathology. He set up the Russian school of pharmacologists of high class who later headed chairs and scientific institutions. Professor Kravkov's disciples were Academicians of the Academy of Medical Science of the USSR Sergey Anichkov and Vasily Zakusov, Corresponding Member of the Academy of Medical Science of the USSR Mikhail Nikolayev, Professors Mikhail Gramenitsky, Vasily Berezin, Grigory Shkavera, Boris Sentiurin, Anatoly Kuznetsov. Kravkov's school of pharmacologists determined the development of pharmacology in the USSR in the 20th century.  Awards  Russian Empire: * Order of Saint Anna 3rd Class * Order of Saint Vladimir 4th Class * Order of Saint Vladimir 3rd Class USSR, Lenin Prize On the 17 August 1926 the Lenin Prize Committee approved the list of the first laureates of this prestigious award. Nikolai Kravkov's name was included in it posthumously for his principal scientific works.  Family  In 1891 Nikolai Kravkov married Olga Bogdanovskaya (1868-1942), daughter of famous Russian surgeon Yevstafy Bogdanovsky. The couple had two children: Olga Kravkova (1892-1942), later married to Mikhail Velichkovsky, a Navy officer, and Sergey Kravkov (1894-1942), Soviet hydrographer and arctic explorer. The couple broke up in 1898 and officially divorced in 1916. The scientist's first wife, his daughter and son died of atrophy in Leningrad besieged by the Nazis. In 1916 Nikolai Kravkov married Ksenia Maximova (1892-1978), daughter of Nikolai Maximov (1861-?) Vice Governor of Perm. Nikolai Kravkov's elder brother was Vasily Kravkov (1859-1920), army medical officer of high rank, author of memories about Russo-Japanese War and World War I. Nikolai Kravkov's younger brother was Sergey Kravkov (1873-1938), Professor of Saint Petersburg University, one of the first Russian soil scientists.

It allowed players to track their achievements and compares their high scores on a leader board. It debuted in July 2012 and was retired September 5, 2018. Amazon GameCircle allows users to organize game achievements, game leaderboards, and the Whispersync application. Whispersync simplifies save files for games by backing them up in its system, which allows players to play online and focus more on gameplay and less on save files. Players can access their games and statistics from any compatible device from the Games menu. GameCircle was originally only compatible with Kindle Fire devices; however, in July 2013 Amazon opened up the application to all Android devices. A GameCircle plug-in became available for Apple and Android devices and the Kindle Fire, Fire HD, and Fire HDX in 2014. Players can choose from a variety of games that can be found on Amazon's GameCircle app store. Amazon released GameCircle in July 2012 as an alternative to Apple's Game Center, which failed at attracting the audience it was created for in 2010. In 2013, Amazon released a study that spanned over three months that showed the success of GameCircle by finding \\"that games using its GameCircle service produced 38 per cent higher conversion rates and 33 per cent more in-app purchases per paying customer than titles which did not\\". As of September 19, 2017, Amazon began the process of disbanding GameCircle. It rolled out updates to its devices such as the Amazon Fire tablet to disable the GameCircle features. No reason for this action was announced by Amazon.

Khalid decided to capture Damascus, the Byzantine stronghold. In Damascus, Thomas, son-in-law of Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, was in charge. Receiving the intelligence of Khalid's march towards Damascus he prepared the defences of Damascus. He wrote to Emperor Heraclius for reinforcement, who was at Emesa that time. Moreover, Thomas, in order to get more time to prepare for a siege, sent the armies to delay, or if possible, halt Khalid's march to Damascus. One such army was defeated at the Battle of Yaqusa (also known as Waqusa) in mid- August 634 near Lake Tiberias 150 km from Damascus. Another army that halted the Muslim advance to Damascus was defeated in the Battle of Marj al-Saffar on 19 August 634.Abu Bakr and Military Expansion - Islamic BooksBattles of Byzantine by John Haldon Some early writers, including Tabari, appear to have confused this action at Yaqusa () with the Battle of Yarmouk, which was fought in the same general area, and have given the year of Yarmuk as 13 Hijri, which is incorrect.

The documentary examines the impact of corporate media and concentration of media ownership on journalism and the news. It is based on the book The Media Monopoly by Ben Bagdikian. The film‚Äôs title is borrowed from a Thomas Paine quote: \\"When men yield up the privilege of thinking, the last shadow of liberty quits the horizon.\\" The film portrays the U.S. media, including the major TV networks, as controlled by fewer and larger conglomerates that exercise extraordinary political social and economic power. It is structured around 14 vignettes that allege censorship at the U.S. networks, including the 1996 TWA 800 air disaster controversy and Nike sweatshops in Asia. It also alleges how the investigation of these stories have cost the jobs, and in some cases the lives, of investigating journalists (as suggested by the case of Gary Webb who committed suicide in 2004. It features interviews with journalists, activists and academics including Amy Goodman, Danny Glover, Julian Assange, Dan Rather, David Simon, Norman Solomon, Robert Baer, Roberta Baskin, Robert W. McChesney, Daniel Ellsberg, Chris Hedges and Kristina Borjesson. Release The film received its premiere at the 2012 Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival. It received its U.S. premiere at the 2013 National Conference for Media Reform in Denver, Colorado. Reception It was selected at numerous festivals including Sheffield Doc/Fest and IDFA. Film critics gave the film mixed reviews. The Hollywood Reporter reported that \\"The timing couldn‚Äôt be better for a theatrical documentary about a corporate media monopoly in American journalism.\\" Rabble.ca gave the film high praise, describing it as \\"beautifully shot and replete with artful graphics and animation, Shadows of Liberty stands on its own as a beautiful artifact\\" adding that \\"Artistry, cinematic or otherwise, and clear-eyed political vision rarely come this close together. Shadows of Liberty as a film, and Jean Philippe Tremblay as auteur are both definitely newsworthy.\\" The Toronto Star gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of five, reporting that \\"Shadows of Liberty asks consumers to look critically at what they are being told, and seek out what they are not\\" but added that \\"Unfortunately, the damning material Tremblay uses is dated\\".

Schmidt (1811, Stettin - 1890, Berlin) was a German botanical artist. He was a specialist in spermatophytes and was a renowned botanical artist (akademischer K√ºnstler zu Berlin) and lithographer who illustrated many of the Germanic botanical works of the 19th century. He is not to be confused with Carl Friedrich Schmidt, born 1832, the Baltic German geologist and botanist.. Biography In collaboration with Otto Karl Berg (1815-1866), professor of pharmaceutical botany at Berlin University, Schmidt was published in Darstellung und Beschreibung in den Pharmacopoea S√§mtliche Borussica offizinellen Gew√§chse aufgef√ºhrten (1853). Publisher: Arthur Felix, LeipzigOtto Karl Berg Schmidt both drew and lithographed the plates. Benjamin Daydon Jackson describes this work, a survey of plants used in the Prussian pharmacopoeia, as \\"A thoroughly good book, probably the very best of its class; both in text and illustrations\\". Berg and Schmidt also published the Pharmacopoea Borussica aufgef√ºhrten offizinellen Gew√§chse in 1846. C.F. Schmidt was a contributing artist to the work K√∂hler's Medizinal Pflanzen. Publisher: Gera-Untermhaus : F.E. K√∂hler, [1883-1914].K√∂hler's Medicinal Plants Medizinal Pflanzen was published in 1887 in Gera, an east-central German city south of Leipzig. The set of four volumes was a noteworthy achievement and included plants of medicinal interest from several European nations. It was described by Sitwell and Blunt as \\"From the botanical standpoint the finest and most useful series of illustrations of medicinal plants.\\" K√∂hler's Medizinal Pflanzen was edited by Gustav Pabst, a German botanist. The remarkable feature of the publication is its nearly 300 finely detailed illustrations, expertly drawn by the artists L. M√ºeller and C.F. Schmidt, which were skillfully rendered by K. Gunther in chromolithography. Chromolithography is the process of rendering images on stone or zinc plates, then inking them with color inks to yield color pictures. It is remotely possible that C.F. Schmidt was the proprietor of the C.F. Schmidt Photography Studio in Halberstadt, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, in the mid 19th century. C.F. Schmidt, the botanical artist/lithographer, lived in Blankenburg am Harz, the village of his son's birth, in 1833.Staatsarchiv HamburgEmigration paper from St. Michaelis Kirche The C.F. Schmidt Photography Studio in Halberstadt is 16 km from Blankenburg. More research needs to be performed in this area to establish any connection. Family Born in Stettin, Kingdom of Prussia, C.F. Schmidt would likely have been an acquaintance, perhaps even a close childhood friend, of Otto Karl Berg, who was also born in Stettin. It is with Berg, as adults, that Schmidt collaborated on several important scientific publications. Schmidt was four years older than Berg. In 1832 C.F. Schmidt married Christiane Johanne Kast.

History The settlement was founded by Irish immigrants in the late 1830s, who first named it Makokiti. It was part of a wave of Catholic settlement encouraged by Mathias Loras, Bishop of Dubuque. His associate, missionary Samuel Charles Mazzuchelli, founded a log church there in 1840 with funds from the Society for the Propagation of the Faith. When St. Patrick's Church was completed, it had about 100 parishioners; the 42 men of the congregation had aided in its construction. By 1842, the congregation had 600 members and had a school and resident pastor. The school was probably the first Catholic school in the Archdiocese of Dubuque. Mazzuchelli noted in 1844 that there were no Protestants in Butler Township. Dennis A. Mahony, an instructor at the school and a future member of the Iowa Senate, suggested that the name of the community be changed to Garryowen (after Garryowen, Limerick) to reflect the community's Irish heritage. In 1854, the congregation built a stone church, today recognized on the National Register of Historic Places. The school closed in 1871 after the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary were unable to secure funding to continue it. Seven parishes in nearby communities stemmed off of St. Patrick's. The post office, founded in 1847, was discontinued in 1900.

LMDB is written in C with API bindings for several programming languages. LMDB stores arbitrary key/data pairs as byte arrays, has a range- based search capability, supports multiple data items for a single key and has a special mode for appending records at the end of the database (MDB_APPEND) which gives a dramatic write performance increase over other similar stores.LMDB Reference Guide . Retrieved on 2014-10-19 LMDB is not a relational database, it is strictly a key-value store like Berkeley DB and dbm. LMDB may also be used concurrently in a multi-threaded or multi-processing environment, with read performance scaling linearly by design. LMDB databases may have only one writer at a time, however unlike many similar key-value databases, write transactions do not block readers, nor do readers block writers. LMDB is also unusual in that multiple applications on the same system may simultaneously open and use the same LMDB store, as a means to scale up performance. Also, LMDB does not require a transaction log (thereby increasing write performance by not needing to write data twice) because it maintains data integrity inherently by design.  History  LMDB's design was first discussed in a 2009 post to the OpenLDAP developer mailing list,back-mdb - futures. Retrieved on 2014-10-19 in the context of exploring solutions to the cache management difficulty caused by the project's dependence on Berkeley DB. A specific goal was to replace the multiple layers of configuration and caching inherent to Berkeley DB's design with a single, automatically managed cache under the control of the host operating system. Development subsequently began, initially as a fork of a similar implementation from the OpenBSD ldapd project.MDB: A Memory-Mapped Database and Backend for OpenLDAP.

Retrieved 2020-03-16  Technical description  Internally LMDB uses B+ tree data structures. The efficiency of its design and small footprint had the unintended side-effect of providing good write performance as well. LMDB has an API similar to Berkeley DB and dbm. LMDB treats the computer's memory as a single address space, shared across multiple processes or threads using shared memory with copy-on-write semantics (known historically as a single-level store). Due to most former modern computing architectures having 32-bit memory address space limitations, which imposes a hard limit of 4 GB on the size of any database using such techniques, the effectiveness of the technique of directly mapping a database into a single- level store was strictly limited. However, today's 64-bit processors now mostly implement 48-bit address spaces, giving access to 47-bit addresses or 128 terabytes of database size,. making databases using shared memory useful once again in real-world applications. Specific noteworthy technical features of LMDB are: * Its use of B+ tree. With an LMDB instance being in shared memory and the B+ tree block size being set to the OS page size, access to an LMDB store is extremely memory efficientB+ tree#Implementation * New data is written without overwriting or moving existing data. This results in guaranteed data integrity and reliability without requiring transaction logs or cleanup services. * The provision of a unique append-write mode (MDB_APPEND) which is implemented by allowing the new record to be added directly to the end of the B+ tree. This reduces the number of reads and write page operations, resulting in greatly-increased performance but requiring that the programmer is responsible for ensuring keys are already in sorted order when storing into the DB. * Copy-on-write semantics help ensure data integrity as well as providing transactional guarantees and simultaneous access by readers without requiring any locking, even by the current writer. New memory pages required internally during data modifications are allocated through copy-on-write semantics by the underlying OS: the LMDB library itself never actually modifies older data being accessed by readers because it simply cannot do so: any shared-memory updates automatically create a completely independent copy of the memory-page being written to. * As LMDB is memory- mapped, it can return direct pointers to memory addresses of keys and values through its API, thereby avoiding unnecessary and expensive copying of memory. This results in greatly-increased performance (especially when the values stored are extremely large), and expands the potential use cases for LMDB. * LMDB also tracks unused memory pages, using a B+ tree to keep track of pages freed (no longer needed) during transactions. By tracking unused pages the need for garbage-collection (and a garbage collection phase which would consume CPU cycles) is completely avoided. Transactions which need new pages are first given pages from this unused free pages tree; only after these are used up will it expand into formerly unused areas of the underlying memory- mapped file. On a modern filesystem with sparse file support this helps minimise actual disk usage. The file format of LMDB is, unlike that of Berkeley DB, architecture-dependent. This means that a conversion must be done before moving a database from a 32-bit machine to a 64-bit machine, or between computers of differing endianness.  Concurrency  LMDB employs multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) and allows multiple threads within multiple processes to coordinate simultaneous access to a database. Readers scale linearly by design. While write transactions are globally serialized via a mutex, read-only transactions operate in parallel, including in the presence of a write transaction, and are entirely wait free except for the first read- only transaction on a thread. Each thread reading from a database gains ownership of an element in a shared memory array, which it may update to indicate when it is within a transaction. Writers scan the array to determine the oldest database version the transaction must preserve, without requiring direct synchronization with active readers.  Performance  In 2011 Google published software which allowed users to generate micro-benchmarks comparing LevelDB's performance to SQLite and Kyoto Cabinet in different scenarios. In 2012 Symas added support for LMDB and Berkeley DB and made the updated benchmarking software publicly available. The resulting benchmarks showed that LMDB outperformed all other databases in read and batch write operations. SQLite with LMDB excelled on write operations, and particularly so on synchronous/transactional writes. The benchmarks showed the underlying filesystem as having a big influence on performance. JFS with an external journal performs well, especially compared to other modern systems like Btrfs and ZFS., 2012-09Database Microbenchmarks, Symas Corp., 2012-07. Zimbra has tested back-mdb vs back-hdb performance in OpenLDAP, with LMDB clearly outperforming the BDB based back-hdb. Many other OpenLDAP users have observed similar benefits. Since the initial benchmarking work done in 2012, multiple follow-on tests have been conducted with additional database engines for both in-memory and on-disk workloads characterizing the performance across multiple CPUs and record sizes. These tests show that LMDB performance is unmatched on all in-memory workloads, and excels in all disk-bound read workloads, as well as disk-bound write workloads using large record sizes. The benchmark driver code was subsequently published on github and further expanded in database coverage.  Reliability  LMDB was designed from the start to resist data loss in the face of system and application crashes. Its copy-on-write approach never overwrites currently-in-use data. Avoiding overwrites means the structure on disk/storage is always valid, so application or system crashes can never leave the database in a corrupted state. In its default mode, at worst a crash can lose data from the last not-yet-committed write transaction. Even with all asynchronous modes enabled, it is only an OS catastrophic failure or hardware power-loss event rather than merely an application crash that could potentially result in any data corruption. Two academic papers from the USENIX OSDI Symposium covered failure modes of DB engines (including LMDB) under a sudden power loss or system crash. The paper from Pillai et al., did not find any failure in LMDB that would occur in the real-world file systems considered; the single failure identified by the study in LMDB only relates to hypothetical file systems. The Mai Zheng et al. paper claims to point out failures in LMDB, but the conclusion depends on whether fsync or fdatasync is utilised. Using fsync ameliorates the problem. Selection of fsync or fdatasync is a compile-time switch which is not the default behavior in current GNU/Linux builds of LMDB, but is the default on macOS, *BSD, Android, and Windows. Default GNU/Linux builds of LMDB are therefore the only ones vulnerable to the problem discovered by the zhengmai researchers however LMDB may simply be rebuilt by GNU/Linux users to utilise fsync instead. When provided with a corrupt database, such as one produced by fuzzing, LMDB may crash. LMDB's author considers the case unlikely to be concerning, but has nevertheless produced a partial fix in a separate branch.  Open source license  In June 2013, Oracle changed the license of Berkeley DB (a related project) from the Sleepycat license to the Affero General Public License, thus restricting its use in a wide variety of applications. This caused the Debian project to exclude the library from 6.0 onwards. It was also criticized that this license is not friendly to commercial redistributors. The discussion was sparked over whether the same licensing change could happen to LMDB. Author Howard Chu made clear that LMDB is part of the OpenLDAP project, which had its BSD style license before he joined, and it will stay like it. No copyright is transferred to anybody by checking in, which would make a similar move like Oracle's impossible. The Berkeley DB license issue has caused major GNU/Linux distributions such as Debian to completely phase out their use of Berkeley DB, with a preference for LMDB.

Howard Chu ported SQLite 3.7.7.1 to use LMDB instead of its original B-tree code, calling the end result SQLightning. One cited insert test of 1000 records was 20 times faster (than the original SQLite with its B-Tree implementation).SQLightning tests. LMDB is available as a backing store for other open source projects including Cyrus SASL, Heimdal Kerberos, and OpenDKIM. It is also available in some other NoSQL projects like MemcacheDB and Mapkeeper. LMDB was used to make the in-memory store Redis persist data on disk. The existing back-end in Redis showed pathological behaviour in rare cases, and a replacement was sought. The baroque API of LMDB was criticized though, forcing a lot of coding to get simple things done however its performance and reliability during testing was considerably better than the alternative back-end stores that were tried. An independent third-party software developer utilised the Python bindings to LMDB in a high-performance environment and published, on the prominent technical news site Slashdot, how the system managed to successfully sustain 200,000 simultaneous read, write and delete operations per second (a total of 600,000 database operations per second).

Technical reviews of LMDB  LMDB makes novel use of well-known computer science techniques such as copy-on-write semantics and B+ trees to provide atomicity and reliability guarantees as well as performance that can be hard to accept, given the library's relative simplicity and that no other similar key-value store database offers the same guarantees or overall performance, even though the authors explicitly state in presentations that LMDB is read-optimised not write-optimised. Additionally, as LMDB was primarily developed for use in OpenLDAP its developers are focused mainly on development and maintenance of OpenLDAP, not on LMDB per se. The developers limited time spent presenting the first benchmark results was therefore criticized as not stating limitations, and for giving a \\"silver bullet impression\\" not adequate to address an engineers attitude (it has to be pointed out that the concerns raised however were later adequately addressed to the reviewer's satisfaction by the key developer behind LMDB.LMDB: The Leveldb Killer?. Retrieved 2014-10-20.) The presentation did spark other database developers dissecting the code in-depth to understand how and why it works. Reviews run from brief to in-depth. Database developer Oren Eini wrote a 12-part series of articles on his analysis of LMDB, beginning July 9, 2013. The conclusion was in the lines of \\"impressive codebase ... dearly needs some love\\", mainly because of too long methods and code duplication. This review, conducted by a .NET developer with no former experience of C, concluded on August 22, 2013 with \\"beyond my issues with the code, the implementation is really quite brilliant. The way LMDB manages to pack so much functionality by not doing things is quite impressive... I learned quite a lot from the project, and it has been frustrating, annoying and fascinating experience\\" Multiple other reviews cover LMDB in various languages including Chinese.

Early life and education  Van Ess was born in New Holland, Michigan, and was educated at Hope College in Michigan and Princeton Theological Seminary, where he studied Semitic languages. In 1911, he married Dorothy Firmin (1885‚Äì1975). Career Van Ess was sent to the Near East in 1902 by the Reformed Church of America. He was first posted to Bahrain to study Arabic. In 1903, Basra, Mesopotamia (now Iraq) became his base. He was a touring evangelist. His Turkish papers said he was a tall, harmless monk. He explored the Two Rivers in the southern region and successfully mapped the area where the Marsh Arabs (Ma'dan) lived on islands built of reeds. He traveled south to the Pirate Coast (now the United Arab Emirates), then north all the way to Istanbul, before he floated his raft, with a goat for milk, twelve watermelons, a bag of rice, his cargo of soap and supplies, six hundred miles along the Euphrates to Al-Fallujah. In 1907‚Äì08, Van Ess acted as the official interpreter and local expert for a British survey led by William Willcocks to study the ancient irrigation systems. He founded a school for boys, the School of High Hope, in Basra in 1912, and his wife a school for girls in the same city in 1914. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the school attracted students from all levels of society. With a curriculum that provided a high-school diploma recognized in the USA, the institution became one of the most influential schools in Iraq. To commemorate Van Ess's 25th anniversary, local Muslim, Christian and Jewish leaders donated $1,800 to build High Hope the first science lab in the Near East. John later became an advisor to the British authorities on the reconstruction of the education system in Iraq. From 1914 to July 1915, he served as the temporary American consul in Basra. In 1914, while acting as American consul in Basra, he informed the British Commander, Sir John Nixon, who had landed nearby, that the Ottoman garrison had withdrawn from Basra, and that the city was undefended; the British then advanced into the city. He also found several secret agents to help Commander Nixon. The Commander of the British forces in Iraq, Sir Arnold Wilson, said that during World War I, \\"Dr. Van Ess's advice and counsel were invaluable\\" and that he and his wife \\"were a valuable element in Basra and played throughout the campaign as before and after it, a useful and honorable part.\\" (p. 188). In 1917, he published a book, The Spoken Arabic of Mesopotamia (2nd ed. The Spoken Arabic of Iraq, 1938) which became a standard text for instructors. For example, Ephraim Avigdor Speiser, professor of comparative Semitic studies, assigned Van Ess's book at the University of Pennsylvania in the late 1920s. Agatha Christie referred to \\"getting on with Van Ess's spoken Arabic\\" in Come, Tell Me How You Live, her 1946 memoir about conducting research in Iraq with her husband, the archaeologist Max Mallowan.  Iraq post-World War I  In 9th Inning in Mesopotamia, Van Ess wrote: \\"I am not British, nor do I have any British affinity, but any fair minded man will have to admit that in Mesopotamia Britain is today showing the world that she is trying to live up to her programs of justice, magnanimity, and civilization.\\" Van Ess \\"was fully convinced that the presence of the British in Iraq was the best thing for the country.\\" He disagreed with (1) bringing a non-Iraqi king into power and (2) with the notion that the majority of Iraqis wanted independence or were ready for it. Thus, he differed with the leading British specialists on Iraq, Col. T. E. Lawrence and Gertrude Bell, a close family friend. \\"Van Ess could not agree with her on much of her thinking about Iraq. He felt that she was too much of a romantic, believing only what she wanted to believe and that her limited knowledge of Arabic, of Arab women and home life ‚Äì she had little interest in that part of Arab culture ‚Äì and of Islam itself was a definite handicap to an objective assessment.\\" Van Ess wrote that Iraq, of which 7/8ths was tribal, should have been organized around tribal loyalty. \\"When Miss Bell and the other members of the Arab Bureau drew a line around Iraq and called it a political entity, they were flying in the face of four millenniums of history.\\" From Van Ess' point of view, if the Iraqi masses had been consulted, the British would have known that the Iraqis first preferred rule under the Turks, then second rule under the British over independence. One of his reasons why the Iraqis were not ready for independence at that time was because less than twenty percent of the men and four percent of the women were literate. However, according to Van Ess, \\"All preferences except those favoring Feisal were airily swept aside by Miss Bell and her associates, who seemed to have the ear of the Colonial Office, and Feisal was proclaimed king on August 23, 1921, amid perfunctory enthusiasm, making \\"Feisal's task as King of Iraq [...] appallingly hard.\\"  Post-war Iraq and death  Just before his death in 1949, \\"Dr. Van Ess had accepted a post with the State Department as a special consultant on Near East affairs. He was to have assumed his duties upon his return to the United States from Iraq. However, he passed away. Instead Mrs. Van Ess took his place after her return.\\"  Personal life  Van Ess's wife Dorothy Van Ess (c. 1885 ‚Äì 1995) was the author of several books about the Middle East. These included Pioneers in the Arab World, about missionaries from the Reformed Church in America who went to the Middle East. Together they had a son, John, who was born in Basra. Like his father, John Jr. was fluent in Arabic. He graduated cum laude from Princeton University in 1938. After which, he returned to Iraq where he taught school in the American School for Boys and then served in the American Military Mission there until he died at age 26. They also had a daughter, identified in Dorothy Van Ess's obituary as \\"Mrs William D. Brewer, wife of the United States Ambassador to the Sudan.\\" Publications *Van Ess, D.

It remained in production, in its original formula, from its introduction until 1986 ‚Äî although, beginning in 1964, Schering AG (the company that produced it) also marketed variants with lower doses of hormones, some of which continued to be named Anovlar. Nand Peeters's research also contributed substantially to the treatment of Rh-disease. Biography Nand Peeters was a son of D√©sir√© Peeters, a surgeon who founded his own clinic in Mechelen. After attending the local Saint Rumbold's high school, he studied at the Catholic University of Leuven, intending to become a gynecologist. But he finished his training in a maternity ward in Bruges. In 1945 he married Paula Langbeen, with whom he had six children, and who was his book-keeper all his life‚ÄîPeeters detested all administrative work. In 1946 he settled as an ob-gyn in Turnhout. At the time Turnhout had none, even though it was (and is) the largest town in the northern part of the Campine, with a population then of about 32,000.Verslag over het Bestuur en de Toestand der Zaken van de Stad Turnhout ‚Ä¶ 7 Juni 1948, available on this page of the Turnhout City Archives. Perinatal infant mortality in Turnhout was between 10 and 12% before his arrival; in his first year in Turnhout he managed to bring it down to two cases in some 500 deliveries. He was appointed head of the Maria Gabri√´l Maternity and of the gynecology department of Turnhout's municipal Saint-Elisabeth hospital in 1951. Under his direction, that department became one of the best in the country.Even as early as January 1954 the statistics about his department that he presented at a meeting at Leuven University turned out to be the best in the country. He acquired the most modern technology available, did innovative research, encouraged young and promising doctors that he hired to do likewise, and introduced new techniques like echography. In 1952 Leuven University appointed him as one of its supervisors of trainee doctors. This appointment was withdrawn in 1963, for reasons that remain unclear.As late as 2011, the university claimed his file, likely to reveal the reason, \\"was hard to find\\". In 1953, also in Turnhout, he founded the Saint-Elisabeth nursing school, where he taught for free. Naturally the school provided him with well-trained nursing staff, whom he entrusted with far greater responsibilities than was customary at the time. He retired in 1986. An intracranial hemorrhage in 1988 ended his active life‚Äîcommunication became impossible. He lived another ten years, dying on December 27, 1998. Ob-gyn Peeters was first and foremost a practicing ob-gyn, a very busy and highly competent one, who stopped counting the number of deliveries that he had done when he reached the number of 30,000. Throughout his career his abiding concern was for the comfort of his patients. He was a man of few words, but a good listener, and the stories told by his patients testify to the respect in which they held him and the trust they put in him.Stories related in De pil van dokter Peeters, a documentary broadcast on March 8, 2012 by Canvas, and in Van den Broeck 2014. Van den Broeck describes his interviews with the first patients that volunteered for Peeters's tests on what was to become Anovlar as the most probing (original Dutch \\"de meest indringende\\") of his entire career of 25 years as a journalist. He did research, taught, and lectured to and published for both health care professionals and the general public. But he did all this because he hoped thereby to improve the welfare of his patients and of pregnant and nubile women in general. Typically, pain management during delivery was the first problem he tackled as a researcher, while still a trainee in Bruges. The development of Anovlar Peeters closely followed the development of various hormones and their uses in the nineteen-fifties. He was aware of the work of Pincus and of the serious side-effects of Pincus's Enovid, which was first introduced as a remedy against menstrual disorders in 1957. He knew that Schering AG had developed a number of hormones, and when Jean Frenay, a representative of Schering, told him the firm had combined two of them, norethisterone acetate and ethinylestradiol into an experimental preparation called SH-513 (containing 2 mg of the former and 0.01 mg of the latter) he asked for enough SH-513 to test it on a number of his patients. Peeters, wrote Frenay to Schering, \\"principally thinks of ovulation inhibition for contraceptive purposes.\\"Letter of May 5, 1959, quoted in Van den Broeck, Janssens & Defoort 2012:322. Thus the idea of developing SH-513 into a contraceptive pill stemmed from Peeters, not from Schering. In fact, initially Schering's principal gynecologist wanted Peeters to test SH-513 as a treatment for dysmenorrhea. But eventually Peeters got formal permission from Schering to test SH-513 for the purpose of contraception. Peeters selected from his patients those whose prognosis envisioned the risks of dying in childbirth, of stillbirth, and/or of Rh disease. He told them explicitly that he was developing a new medication, and got their permission to test it on them. The results of his small-scale trial (on no more than 50 fertile married women)Van den Broeck, Janssens & Defoort 2012:323. led him to conclude that a dose of 3 to 4 mg of norethisterone acetate and 'at least' 0.05 mg of ethinylestradiol was both efficient and had few side effects. Schering then made its SH-639 using this dose, and had it tested in trials in Germany, Australia, Japan and the USA on 14,038 menstrual cycles of 2433 women. The conclusion was an outright recommendation to introduce SH-639 as a hormonal contraceptive. But Schering hesitated to introduce it in Germany, fearing comparison with Nazi eugenics, still a painful memory in that country.Understandably so. Carl Clauberg, for example, had taken part in Schering clinical research programs before WWII (Van den Broeck, Janssen & Defoort 2012:324) and had experimented with progestins. ‚Äî On the relationship between Schering AG and Nazism, see Wlasich 2011. It was first introduced in Australia, on February 1961, as \\"Anovlar\\", a name intended to mean 'without ovulation'. The following tableFrom Albach 1997:939. shows Anovlar‚Äôs introduction times in a number of countries: * Australia: February 1961 * Germany: June 1961 * Switzerland: October 1961 * Austria: June 1962 * France: February 1964 * Spain: June 1964 * Belgium: March 1965 * Italy: end of the 1960s * Japan: beginning of the 1970s only for \\"gynecological indications\\"; June 1999 for contraceptive purposes Fame ‚Ä¶ The results of Peeters's research were published as Peeters F., M. Van Roy & R. Oeyen 1960. (Van Roy was Peeters's clinical biologist; Oeyen, his assistant.) Requests for offprints came flooding in from all over the world, especially after the introduction of Anovlar, over 50,000 of them. He addressed the Third World Congress of Gynecology and Obstetrics (Vienna, September 1961) and the 60th Congress of the North-West-German Gynecological Society (Kiel, 1961). He also spoke at the Second Fertility Congress in Brussels, where he met with Eleanor Mears, co-author of a highly favorable report of a large-scale clinical trial of Anovlar, published in the prestigious BMJ.From the Summary: \\"this would appear a most acceptable form of contraception. The product was well tolerated and side-effects were few. ‚Ä¶ Cycle control was remarkably good ‚Ä¶ As a result of this [trial] ‚Ä¶, the Council for the Investigation of Fertility Control has recommended anovlar for use as an alternative oral contraceptive in F.P.A. clinics.\\" In the early sixties, his reputation was considerable. ‚Ä¶ and silence But in his own country, Peeters faced problems. Until 1973, publications on birth control were liable to fall foul of Belgian law, which considered them obscene. In Belgium, Peeters had to keep quiet about his work.A meeting of the Flemish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology Peeters co-hosted on May 1960 in Turnhout had as its subject \\"ovulation suppressors\\". But its minutes make no mention of \\"birth control\\" or \\"contraception\\", subjects which might well have led to its being considered an obscene meeting. In addition, Belgium was a very catholic country, and at the time the Catholic Church's controlling document on hormonal contraception was Casti connubii, which flatly forbade it. Peeters's employ was in the hands of the town council of Turnhout, entirely dominated by the Christian People's Party. The threat of losing his job, which he loved, was real, and he had to thread very carefully as long as the church forbade artificial contraception and as long as Turnhout remained monolithically catholic, i.e., throughout his active life.It is possible, but not certain, that a presentation Peeters gave at a congress of the International Fertility Association held at the Catholic University of Leuven in 1963 led to the withdrawal of his appointment to supervise trainee doctors. However, since October 1958, John XXIII was pope, and Aggiornamento seemed possible, even in his church's view on birth control. Nand Peeters thought so. On May 1, 1963, he was granted a short private audience with John XXIII, from which he came away with the impression \\"that the pope provided support for the pill\\".A somewhat literal translation from the original Dutch: \\"dat de paus zijn steun verleende aan de pil\\". At any rate, in 1963 John XXIII established the Pontifical Commission on Birth Control, which continued its work under the aegis of pope Paul VI, though in a much expanded composition. In 1964, Paul VI convened the First European Congress of Catholic Doctors (Malta, 1964), which was almost entirely devoted to birth control. Peeters was one of the speakers. When Paul VI confirmed the church's total rejection of birth control by \\"artificial methods\\" in his Humanae vitae in 1968, Peeters was greatly disappointed and angry.At one point he fumed: \\"We'll go to the pope and we'll tell him that he should write an encyclical Pacem in Utero (Peace in the Womb).\\" The allusion is to John XXIII's last encyclical, Pacem in Terris. But he was a devout and committed catholic, and he could not square it with his conscience to publicly distance himself from the teaching of the church. The Catholic Church's ban on artificial birth control as well as the political situation in Turnhout left him no choice but to withdraw into silence. This he did so successfully that his own children knew only vaguely that he had had something to do with Anovlar. That it was he who actually developed it they discovered only in 1995, when Schering, unaware of Peeters's medical condition, asked him for help in contributing to the eponymous catalog (Staupe & Vieth 1996) of Die Pille: Von der Lust und von der Liebe, an exhibition put on by the German Hygiene Museum. The result was that his name fell into oblivion. When he died, only the local Turnhout press reported on his death. Peeters's ethics about the pill Peeters never accepted his church's absolute prohibition of the pill. He never repudiated his work on Anovlar. On the contrary, he was quietly proud of it. When he was asked to contribute an article on himself in a Dutch version of Who's Who, he cited just one publication, Peeters 1970, his Dutch adaptation of a German work on hormone treatment, intended for doctors. He wanted them to continue to use hormones, including Anovlar, which he discussed in this book without mentioning his role in its development. And he continued to do research, not only on Anovlar, but also on other pills, such as Eugynon, Aconcen and Sequilar. However, he published his results only in medical journals. More importantly, he unhesitatingly prescribed the pill when he deemed that a patient's health was threatened by too many pregnancies (too often life-threatening ones‚Äîten or twelve children was not unusual in the Campine in the sixties), by late pregnancies or by the threat of yet another stillbirth, due, e.g., to Rh- disease. He would not have others, whoever they might be, influence his medical judgment, and for him the health of his patient always remained paramount. Also, he defended in no uncertain terms a couple's right to decide on the number of children they would have: \\"It is you and your husband who decide the number of your children, and that's not the pope's business.\\" Even so, Peeters remained a fundamentally conservative catholic, who strongly disapproved of the loose mores of the sexual revolution, largely due to the pill,One of his sons claims that this disapproval was also one of the reasons Peeters did not discuss Anovlar, which was in effect his indirect contribution to this sexual revolution. and who agreed with his church that coitus should only take place within marriage. Other research In 1964, Ortho Pharmaceutical asked Peeters to participate in a clinical trial of a variant of RhoGAM, its Rho(D) immune globulin. He accepted. Peeters took the lead of a small team of doctors and a great number of midwives, whom he alerted to the problem of Rh-disease and who, aware of his excellent reputation in the region, willingly cooperated. The medication was tested on more than 700 women, and the trial was a resounding success: not a single case of Rh-disease was reported, leading one of his colleagues to say that it made the Campine the first Rh-disease free region in the world. When he presented the results to a Berlin conference attended by over 2500 gynecologists and pediatricians,This information (in Van den Broeck 2014:209) is based on a reminiscence of a collaborator of Nand Peeters‚Äôs, who puts the conference (which he does not specify further) in 1967 in Berlin. Probably it was the first European Congress of Perinatology, held in Berlin in 1968. it turned out that his was by far the most extensive clinical trial. But he ascribed its success to the midwives and the maternities involved in the study, and he did not even publish his results. He was too busy lecturing and teaching refresher courses to doctors. Nonmedical activities Whilst studying and for some time after his study, he was also a prominent leader in a catholic youth movement, the \\"Katholieke Studenten Actie\\" (KSA). His was a serious and time- consuming commitment: he wrote a brochure (Peeters 1944) for them, and in the days before his marriage, he could not be reached for a while, because he was inspecting KSA summer camps (together with Pieter De Somer, another KSA-leader who was to become a noted medical researcher). In 1948, upon the death of Jozef Simons, Nand Peeters succeeded him as chairman of the Turnhout branch of the Davidsfonds, a function which he retained until 1965. Trivia * In 1970 the then Minister of Culture Frans Van Mechelen sent one of his collaborators to the immensely popular Nand Peeters to ask him to run for mayor of Turnhout for the Christian People's Party. Peeters refused: a doctor should be there for everyone, and not be beholden to a political party. * On October 23, 1985, Pope John Paul II granted Peeters the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice award, obviously not for his development of Anovlar, but for his services to education. * On Monday March 31, 2014, the Turnhout City Council decided that a street in a new social housing development is to be named \\"Dokter Nand Peetersstraat\\".Het Laatste Nieuws April 2, 2014.

Description Carybdea marsupialis is a small transparent jellyfish with a box-shaped bellMarsupialis denotes \\"having a pouch\\", from the Late Latin marsupium, \\"pouch\\". about across, at the four lower corners of which are four elongated tentacles up to long. The bell has a number of small white or yellowish warts with stinging cells, and near the margin, equidistant from the tentacles, are four rhopalia (sensory structures with ocelli). This species can be distinguished from other similar species by the red banding on the tentacles. Distribution Carybdea marsupialis was once considered a widespread species found in warm oceans around the world. Taxonomic reviews have shown that most of these are other species in the genus Carybdea, with the true C. marsupialis essentially restricted to the Mediterranean Sea. It is the only box jellyfish in this sea. It is pelagic and is present in the upper few metres of the sea. Biology C. marsupialis, illustration from Medusae of the World, vol. 3, by A.G. Mayer Carybdea marsupialis is a predator and feeds on invertebrates and even small fish which it captures with the nematocysts (stinging cells) in its tentacles, often in shallow waters. It swims by making rapid contractions of the bell and can move at a speed of between per minute. Like other species in its genus it has comparatively sophisticated eyes with lenses. With their help it can detect obstacles such as posts or a ship's rudder and avoid them. It often occurs in small groups. The sting is venomous to humans but some swimmers do not notice any painful sensation. In severe cases, the symptoms can be systemic, including pain at the sting site and elsewhere, paresthesia, hyperesthesia and skin lesions, and may take a few months to fully disappear. Although it is far less dangerous than some box jellyfish species from other parts of the world, it is considered the second-most important stinging jellyfish in the Mediterranean (Pelagia noctiluca being the most important). The life history of this box jellyfish is complex. The sexes are separate and sexual reproduction takes place with the emission of gametes into the open water. After fertilisation, a planula larva forms which later develops into a cubopolyp with a few tentacles. This can reproduce asexually by budding, the buds soon becoming detached. At first they creep across the substrate with the tentacular region leading. During this mobile stage, pieces may become detached or the cubopolyp may split transversely; these fragments regenerate their missing parts within 72 hours. The resulting polyps then attach themselves to the substrate and grow a full complement of 24 tentacles. About a month later they become detached, the multiple tentacles are reabsorbed and the four tentacles typical of the medusa phase develop.

The Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute is based in Edmonton, Alberta. According to Alberta Innovates-Technology Futures (AITF), a key partner in the ABMI, the ABMI, which acts as \\"an early warning system by monitoring the cumulative effects of biodiversity change in regions throughout Alberta\\" is \\"the largest project of its kind ever attempted in Canada.\\" Collaborating agencies include the government-industry research agency Alberta Innovates-Technology Futures, the University of Alberta, University of Calgary and the Royal Alberta Museum. Along with the Alberta Forest Management Planning Standard, the ABMI are key components to implementing resource planning based on ecosystem management principles. Alberta Environment and Parks consults the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Agency's reports in monitoring and preservation of species, setting benchmarks for biodiversity for land use plans. If industry contributes to the endangerment of a species that falls below these benchmarks, the Government of Alberta can order remedial action. Location The ABMI Science Centres are located at the University of Alberta, Alberta Innovates and the University of Calgary. Their Processing Centre is at the Royal Alberta Museum and their Information and Application Centre is at the University of Alberta. The ABMI Monitoring Centre is located at Alberta Innovates Technology Futures offices in Vegreville. Dan Farr has been Director at the Application Centre since April 2010.  History  Since the 1990s it was recognized that Alberta needed a comprehensive provincial biodiversity monitoring program but at that time the province did not have the capacity to conduct such a program. Phase 1 (1998-2002) of what was then called Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Program (ABMP) was funded by $1 M cash from Alberta forest industries, oil and gas industries, the provincial government, and non-government organizations. Between 1998 and 2003 a group of researchers reviewed literature regarding protocols for sampling terrestrial biota and habitat structures. Scientists involved in the research included \\"Dan Farr, Chris Shank, Rich Moses, Stan Boutin, Erin Bayne (vertebrates), Phil Lee, Steve Hanus (forest structure and vascular plants), Jennifer Doubt, Rene Belland (mosses), Anna-Liisa Sippola, Jogeir Stokland (fungi), Neville Winchester, Bert Finnamore, Jeff Battigelli, Heather Proctor (arthropods), and others.\\" Jim Schieck, Chris Shank and Dan Farr combined these protocols into an integrated suite \\"designed to be cost effective and capable of monitoring a diversity of biota, over broad spatial scales and long time periods.\\" In a 2007 interview ABMI lead scientist, Jim Schieck of the Alberta Research Council, described how the ABMI \\"program was developed in the last 5 years, 6 or 7 years.\\" The team of 7 or 8 people at the University of Alberta were investigating effective management and monitoring of biota using statistical data management on species and habitats and ecosystems to set benchmarks for future reference. Phase 2 (2003-2007) involved the development of a prototype \\"designed to test the protocols, develop systems and generate product streams to the satisfaction of the sponsors and potential future clients.\\" Funding for 2003 was $675,000. By 2006 the team had completed the background scientific development and moved into the prototype project, a small scale program. The ABMI began working in 2003 and at that time one of the ABMI projects involved working with a small company in Saskatoon to develop equipment with highly sensitive microphones to record bird vocalizations digitally that could then be interpreted in a laboratory setting. This standardized the process using \\"technology that records bird calls at a very fine level, and then having an expert go through the calls to identify the birds correctly.\\" In 2006 the Collaborative Research and Development (CRD) at the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Program published A Manual for Estimating Biodiversity Intactness for the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Program: Description and Working Example. With funding from ABMI, a team of researchers from Alberta Research Council and the University of Alberta used winter mammal tracking sites in the boreal forest of Alberta to measure biodiversity intactness to be used as baselines in monitoring biodiversity. The \\"southern boreal forest had the lowest intactness and the greatest human footprint.\\" They published their findings in an article in Biological Conservation. However, from 2007 to 1 April 2013, the ABMI's financing and administration was not self-managed but was dependent on the University of Alberta's systems. In 2012 the Province of Alberta passed legislation to enable the ABMI to generate and collect funds to finance their program. \\"New legislation to formally establish the provincial monitoring entity was expected in the fall of 2013.\\" By February 2012 although the ABMI was \\"identified as a key component of the Joint Canada-Alberta Monitoring Plan and has many strong elements ‚Äì scientific leadership, publicly accessible information, and value-neutral result presentation\\" the Institute had not secured full funding which limited \\"its ability to deliver sound monitoring data.\\" By 2013 the private sector increased payments $4,190,445 from $2,896,000 in 2012. In 2012 the Government of Alberta gave $5,205,000 and increased that to $5,305,000 in 2013 when the Government of Canada decreased their funding to $0. A 2014 ABMI report commissioned by the Canadian Oilsands Innovation Alliance (COSIA), one of ABMI's stakeholders, showed a decline of 20 per cent among bird species in northern Alberta. The report covered all three oil sands areas, Peace River, Fort McMurray and Cold Lake. ABMI board member and Pembina Institute Director, Simon Dyer, described how \\"what gets measured, gets managed.\\" While \\"longtime agriculture on private land has a bigger footprint on northern Alberta landscape than the oilsands industry or forestry\\", the former is static whereas the latter are expanding and they are on Crown land where the government has more authority. Board of directors The ABMI Board of Directors has from seven to fourteen Directors \\"representing the Government of Alberta, environmental non-governmental organization sector, forest sector, energy sector, agriculture sector, and the research community.\\" The Pembina Institute and the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers CAPP are represented on the ABMI board. Partners and Sponsors According to the ABMI 2012-2013 Annual Report, partners and sponsors include industry, universities, governmental and non-governmental organizations: Alberta Innovates Bio Solutions, Alberta Innovates Technology Futures, Alberta Land Institute, Alberta Livestock and Meat Agency Ltd, Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries Inc, Athabasca Oil Corporation, Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Cenovus Energy, Climate Change and Emissions Management Corporation, Connacher Oil and Gas Corporation, ConocoPhillips Canada, Devon Operating Corporation (now operating as Brion Energy Corporation), Ecological Monitoring Committee for the Lower Athabasca, Environment Canada, Government of Alberta, Hammerstone Corporation, Husky Energy, Imperial Oil, Ivanhoe Energy Inc., Japan Canada Oilsands Ltd., Laricina Energy Ltd., MEG Energy, NEXEN Inc., Oilsands Developers Group, Royal Albert Museum, Shell Canada, Southern Pacific Research Corp., Statoil, Suncor Energy, Sunshine Oilsands Ltd, Syncrude, Teck Resources Ltd., Total E & P Canada Ltd., the University of Alberta and the University of Calgary.

What the ABMI provides, for the first time, is a meaningful metric of environmental impact or biodiversity performance that governments could use to inform decision making.\\" According to Dyer, in pristine northeastern Alberta \\"there is still time to do proper land use planning, identify conservation areas for biodiversity and ensure good planning going forward.\\" Dyer explains that the projected quadrupling of oil sands production \\"without a proper plan in place to mitigate those impacts\\" is what concerns oil sands critics, not the current impacts. According to the Pembina Institute blog, \\"The ABMI is identified as a key component of the Joint Canada-Alberta Monitoring Plan and has many strong elements ‚Äì scientific leadership, publicly accessible information, and value- neutral result presentation. However, the ABMI still has not secured full funding, so the ABMI's ability to deliver sound monitoring data is limited by the availability of resources to support its work.\\" Joint Canada-Alberta Monitoring Plan In February 2012 Canada's Environment Minister, Peter Kent announced the launch of the Joint Canada-Alberta Monitoring Plan or Joint Canada-Alberta Implementation Plan for Oil Sands Monitoring, with aspirations of becoming a transparent, accountable world class oil sands environmental monitoring system. The Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI) is the key component of the Joint Canada-Alberta Monitoring Plan.  Methodologies  The ABMI and the Alberta Forest Management Planning Standard are based on the cumulative approach and ecosystem management principles. According to Cathy Olesen MP, Researchers from ABMI and the University of Alberta using the oil sands industry of Alberta as case study in their paper in which they challenged the economic prudence of the costly equivalency-based biodiversity offset systems by using ABMI's \\"empirically derived index of biodiversity intactness to link offsets with losses incurred by development.\\" Boreal woodland caribou According to the 2014 ABMI report all six herds of caribou including the threatened boreal and the endangered mountain caribou \\"have suffered annual rates of decline ranging from 4.6% to 15.2% from 1993 to 2012\\" in the oil sands region (OSR) as oil and gas production booms in northern Alberta. As these herds in the oil-sands region are \\"genetically distinct\\" from other boreal caribou populations, the ABMI report concludes that, \\"It is therefore unlikely that populations in the (region) will gain new members from caribou populations in other parts of the province.\\" In an article in The Wall Street Journal, Dawson observed that, \\"The report comes amid controversy over Alberta's recent sales of oil and gas development leases in areas populated by both boreal and mountain caribou.\\"  Citations   References      * Category:Biodiversity Category:Nature conservation in Canada Category:Natural history of Alberta Category:Organizations based in Edmonton Category:Environmental organizations based in Canada ","title":"Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute"},{"id":"44933688","title":"The Hermitage, Friars Carse"},{"id":"44933690","text":"Stephen Lawrence Bragg (1923‚Äì2014) was a British engineer who was Vice Chancellor of Brunel University from 1971-81.

Other names for this type of filter are active-ladder or multiple feedback filter. The arrangement of feedback loops in the signal flow-graph of the simulated ladder filter inspired the name leapfrog filter, which was coined by Girling and Good. The leapfrog filter maintains the low component sensitivity of the passive ladder filter that it simulates. Synthesis Generic ladder filters with either (a) voltage input/voltage output, (b) current input/voltage output, (c) voltage input/current output or (d) current input/ current output. The output may also be the voltage across or the current through an internal component of the last element. The definition and synthesis of leapfrog filters is described by Temes & LaPatra, Sedra & Brackett, Chen and Wait, Huelsman & Korn. Synthesis of leapfrog filters typically includes the following steps: :1. Determine a prototype passive ladder filter that has the desired frequency response. Usually a doubly terminated prototype is used. :2. Write the equations relating element current to voltage across the element in a form suitable for expression as a signal- flow graph. :3. Draw the signal-flow graph. The nodes of the signal-flow graph will include both voltages and currents. The branch gains will include impedances and admittances. :4. Convert all nodes of the signal-flow graph to voltages and all impedances to dimensionless transmittances. This is accomplished by dividing all impedance elements by R, an arbitrary resistance and multiplying all admittance elements by R. This scaling does not change the frequency response. :5. Manipulate the signal-flow graph so that the gains feeding each summing node have the same signs. This is done as an implementation convenience. At the completion of this step, typically, all the feedback gains in the signal-flow graph will be +1 and the signs of the gain blocks in the forward path will alternate. As a result, some of the nodes, including the main output, may have a 180¬∞ phase inversion. This is usually of no consequence. :6. The gain blocks are implemented with active filters and interconnected as indicated by the signal-flow graph. Often, state variable filters are used for the gain blocks. :7. The final circuit usually has more components than the prototype passive filter. This means the final circuit has degrees of freedom which can be chosen to optimize the circuit for dynamic range and for practical component values. Examples Generic filter Four element ladder filter with voltage input and voltage output Three stages of signal-flow graph development of a four element ladder filter with voltage input and voltage output. The design starts out with a known ladder filter of one of the typologies shown in the previous figure. Usually, all the elements of the ladder filter are lossless except the first and the last which are lossy. Using a four element voltage input, voltage output ladder filter as an example, the equations that relate the element voltages and currents are as follows: :: I_1 = (V_0 -V_2) \\\\mathrm{Y_1} :: V_2 = (I_1 -I_3) \\\\mathrm{Z_2} :: I_3 = (V_2 -V_4) \\\\mathrm{Y_3} :: V_4 = (I_3 ) \\\\mathrm{Z_4} The signal- flow graph for these equations are shown in the second figure to the right. The arrangement of feedback loops in the signal flow-graph inspired the name leapfrog filter. The signal flow graph is manipulated to convert all current nodes into voltage nodes and all the impedances and admittances into dimensionless transmittances. This is equivalent to manipulating the equations either by multiplying both sides by R or by multiplying one side by R/R and distributing the R terms across the subtraction operation. This manipulation changes the equations as follows: :: V_1 = (V_0 -V_2) \\\\mathrm{H_1} :: V_2 = (V_1 -V_3) \\\\mathrm{H_2} :: V_3 = (V_2 -V_4) \\\\mathrm{H_3} :: V_4 = (V_3 ) \\\\mathrm{H_4} ::where H1 = RY1, H2 = GZ2, H3 = RY3, H4 = GZ4, G = 1/R, V1 = RI1, V3 = RI3 The signal flow graph is further manipulated so that the gains into each summing node is +1. The result of all the manipulation is shown as the bottom signal-flow graph in the figure. The equations represented by the resulting signal flow graph are as follows: :: -V_1 = (V_0 -V_2) ( - \\\\mathrm{H_1} ) :: -V_2 = (-V_1 +V_3) \\\\mathrm{H_2} :: V_3 = (-V_2 +V_4) ( -\\\\mathrm{H_3} ) :: V_4 = (V_3 ) \\\\mathrm{H_4} The awkward annotation of -V1 and -V2 as labels of nodes in the signal flow graph indicates that these nodes present a 180¬∞ phase inversion with respect to the signals in the prototype filter. This manipulation is can be accomplished by a simple procedure: :1. Make all the odd numbered or all the even numbered transmittances negative. The overall phase shift with respect to the prototype will be 0¬∞ if the total number of inversions is even. :2. Change all feedback gains to +1. :3. Determine the sign of each node label by counting the number of inversions to that node from the input. If the number of inversions is odd, then the node label is negative. The signal-flow graph is suitable for implementation. State variable filters that are available in both inverting and non-inverting typologies are often used. Band pass filter A schematic for a passive band pass electronic filter Passive circuit The circuit for a band pass, passive ladder filter is first determined. The individual components in parallel or series can be combined into general impedances or admittances. For this schematic: :: \\\\mathrm{Z_1} = \\\\frac {s\\\\mathrm{L_1}} {s^2\\\\mathrm{C_1}\\\\mathrm{L_1} + s \\\\frac \\\\mathrm{L_1} \\\\mathrm{R_1} + \\\\mathrm{1}} :: {\\\\mathrm{Y_2}} = \\\\frac {s\\\\mathrm{C_2}} {s^2\\\\mathrm{C_2}\\\\mathrm{L_2} + \\\\mathrm{1}} :: \\\\mathrm{Z_3} = \\\\frac{s\\\\mathrm{L_3}} {s^2\\\\mathrm{C_3}\\\\mathrm{L_3} + 1} :: \\\\mathrm{Y_4} = \\\\frac{s\\\\mathrm{C_4}} {s^2\\\\mathrm{C_4}\\\\mathrm{L_4} + s \\\\mathrm{C_4} \\\\mathrm{R_4} + 1} The signal flow-graph representation of the ladder filter equations. Signal-flow graph The current and voltage variables can be put into cause and effect relationships as follows. :: V_1 = (I_0 -I_2) \\\\mathrm{Z_1} :: I_2 = (V_1 -V_3) \\\\mathrm{Y_2} :: V_3 = (I_2 -I_4) \\\\mathrm{Z_3} :: I_4 = V_3 \\\\mathrm{Y_4} :: V_\\\\mathrm{out} = I_4 \\\\mathrm{R_4} A signal flow graph for these equations is shown to the right. Scaled signal-flow graph For implementation reasons, the current variables may be multiplied by an arbitrary resistance to convert them into voltage variables which also converts all gains to dimensionless values. In this example all currents are multiplied by R. This is accomplished by either multiplying both sides of an equation by R of by multiplying one side by R/R and then distributing the R term over the currents. The signal flow-graph representation of the ladder filter equations with impedances scaled by R, an arbitrary resistance. :: V_1 = \\\\mathrm{R}(I_0 -I_2) \\\\frac \\\\mathrm{Z_1} \\\\mathrm{R} = ( V_0 - V_2) \\\\mathrm{H_1} :: V_2 = \\\\mathrm{R} I_2 = (V_1 -V_3) \\\\mathrm{R} \\\\mathrm{Y_2} = (V_1 -V_3) \\\\mathrm{H_2} :: V_3 = \\\\mathrm{R}(I_2 -I_4) \\\\frac \\\\mathrm{Z_3} \\\\mathrm{R} = ( V_2 - V_4) \\\\mathrm{H_3} :: V_4 = \\\\mathrm{R} I_4 = V_3 \\\\mathrm{R} \\\\mathrm{Y_4}= V_3 \\\\mathrm{H_4} :: V_{\\\\mathrm{out}} = \\\\mathrm{R} I_4 \\\\frac \\\\mathrm{R_4} \\\\mathrm{R} = V_4 \\\\mathrm{H_5} Manipulated signal- flow graph It is convenient for implementation if the gains feeding the summing nodes all have the same sign. In that case, summation can be achieved with a junction of two resisters. The signal flow-graph representation of the ladder filter equations with impedances scaled by R, an arbitrary resistance. The signs of the gains have been manipulated so that all gains feeding into a node have the same signs. :: V_1 = ( V_0 + (-V_2)) \\\\mathrm{H_1} :: -V_2 = (V_1 + (-V_3)) ( \\\\mathrm{-H_2} ) :: -V_3 = ( (-V_2) + V_4) \\\\mathrm{H_3} :: V_4 = V_3 ( \\\\mathrm{-H_4} ) :: V_{\\\\mathrm{out}} = ( V_4 ) \\\\mathrm{H_5} Implementation Modified Tow-Thomas active biquad filter with summing inputs and complimentary band pass outputs suitable for use in a leapfrog filter. VBP is the bandpass output, VBPI is the inverted bandpass output, VLPI is the inverted lowpass output. All the transmittances H1 \\\\- H4, in this example, are bandpass filters. They can be implemented with the modified Tow- Thomas active biquad filter. This biquad has both positive and negative bandpass outputs so that it can realize any of the transmittances. This biquad also has summing inputs so it can also implement the summing nodes. :: \\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm{BP}} {V_\\\\mathrm{1}} = \\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm{BP}} {V_\\\\mathrm{2}} = -\\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm{BPI}} {V_\\\\mathrm{1}} = -\\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm{BPI}} {V_\\\\mathrm{2}} = \\\\frac { s / ({\\\\mathrm{R_d}\\\\mathrm{C_a}})} {s^2 + s / ({\\\\mathrm{R_a}\\\\mathrm{C_a}}) + 1 / ({\\\\mathrm{R_b}\\\\mathrm{R_c}\\\\mathrm{C_a}\\\\mathrm{C_b}}) } :: \\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm{LPI}} {V_\\\\mathrm{1}} = \\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm{LPI}} {V_\\\\mathrm{2}} = - \\\\frac { s / ({\\\\mathrm{R_b}\\\\mathrm{R_d}\\\\mathrm{C_a}\\\\mathrm{C_b}})} {s^2 + s / ({\\\\mathrm{R_a}\\\\mathrm{C_a}}) + 1 / ({\\\\mathrm{R_b}\\\\mathrm{R_c}\\\\mathrm{C_a}\\\\mathrm{C_b}})} =Tuning= A leapfrog filter can be difficult to tune because of the complicated feedback. One strategy is to open the feedback loops so that the remaining filter structure is a simple cascade design. Each section can then be tuned independently. The inner sections, H2 and H3 have infinite Q and may be unstable when the feedback loops are opened. These stages may be designed with a large, but finite Q so that they can be tuned while the feedback loops are open.

Diplomatic relations were established on 11 November 1964, which caused South Korea to break off relations with Mauritania. On 4 November 1964 North Korea and Mauritania had issued a Joint Communiqu√© calling for the withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from Asia, Africa and Latin America, and endorsing the second Afro-Asian conference. In 1967, President Moktar Ould Daddah of Mauritania went on a state visit to Pyongyang. In 1970, Kang Ryang- uk led a delegation to Mauritania. On 30 May 1975, Kim Il-sung made a state visit to Mauritania. This, jointly with a visit to neighbouring Algeria during the same trip, was the sole occasion that the North Korean leader visited a country outside of the East bloc and Asia. This is commemorated in the International Friendship Exhibition, which features a world map on which Mauritania and other countries visited by the country's Eternal President are lit up (in addition to a photo of Kim and President Ould Daddah). During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Mauritanian‚ÄìNorth Korean relations were presumably strained due to North Korean aid to and military backing for the Polisario Front and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic during the Western Sahara War.

It has pale bundles of root-like organs under ground that attract, trap, and digest protozoans. These organs are subterranean leaves, which lack chlorophyll. This species is unique in the genus in its formation of tubers. As of 2014, Genlisea tuberosa has the smallest known genome of any flowering plant.  Distribution and habitat  Genlisea tuberosa is endemic to Brazil where it is found only in the campos rupestres vegetation in the Brazilian states of Bahia, Goi√°s, Distrito Federal, and Minas Gerais. It grows in fast- draining sandy soils in seasonally wet areas from altitude. It can be found growing in the presence of other species of Genlisea, including G. aurea, G. filiformis, and G. violacea, and among Utricularia, Drosera, and some grasses. Genlisea tuberosa flowers from February to June in its native habitat and enters dormancy during the winter dry season.  Genome  The genomes of several species in the genus Genlisea were studied in 2006 along with other members of the Lentibulariaceae family. According to the study, prior to its publication the smallest known angiosperm (flowering plant) genome was that of Arabidopsis thaliana at 157 Megabase pairs (Mbp). This 2006 report identified the related species G. margaretae as having the smallest known angiosperm genome size at 63.4 Mbp, just 0.2 Mbp lower than that of Genlisea aurea. Further research in 2014 found that the recently described Genlisea tuberosa has the smallest angiosperm genome known at around 61 Mbp.  Botanical history  Genlisea tuberosa was first discovered by the carnivorous plant specialist Thomas Carow in the late 1980s near the town of Diamantina in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Carow, however, identified the specimens he examined as Genlisea pygmaea. The new species was later rediscovered by Fernando Rivadavia in 2007 and formally described by Rivadavia, Paulo Minatel Gonella, and Andreas Fleischmann in a 2013 issue of the journal Systematic Botany.

According to the investigating authorities and the majority in the state's parliament, no substantial evidence for the existence of such criminal and corruptible networks could be found. They assert that the (now disbanded) organized crime office at the state's domestic intelligence service and its main source, a Leipzig police detective, had overstated the suspected cases in an unprofessional way, and some journalists had further exaggerated the facts. The opposition and some media still had doubts about the official explanation, even after a parliamentary inquiry committee had completed its work. Former victims of child prostitution as well as journalists reporting on the case have been charged with libel (but were eventually acquitted), raising warnings by press freedom advocates. Background The \\"Sachsensumpf\\" scandal involves several criminal cases dating back to the 1990s. Whether or not they are connected with each other, is a matter of debate. One of the cases that was believed to be connected was the child prostitution case of an illegal brothel in Western Leipzig, named \\"Jasmin\\", where the pimp and former boxer Michael W. Alias Martin Kugler exploited eight girls aged 13 to 19 for sexual services in 1992 and early 1993. The brothel, hidden in a flat, was raided by the police on 28 January 1993. The Landgericht (district court) of Leipzig convicted Kugler of human trafficking, in coincidence with pimping, promotion of prostitution and sexual abuse of children and sentenced him to four years and two months in prison. The presiding judge in this trial, J√ºrgen Niemeyer, called the verdict \\"a major concession (to the perpetrator), but only just acceptable.\\"Jana Simon, Sigrid Reinichs in the 'Zeitmagazin' (Die Zeit) Nr. 10, M√§rz 2012 However, none of the clients of the brothel were identified; the girls were never even asked to identify them during the whole investigation or the trial. Another case was the attempted murder of Martin Klockzin on October 1994, then head of the legal department of the Leipzig Housing Company (Leipziger Wohnungs- und Baugesellschaft, LWB). The LWB is the successor to the former state-owned housing enterprise that administered all flats in Leipzig during an East Germany's communist era, until being privatised after Germany's reunification. The assassination attempt was believed to be linked to illegal property deals during the privatization of real estate in the post- reunification years. Three of the hitmen received life sentences, while their employers were initially not identified. Several years later, in 1999 and 2000, detective chief inspector Georg Wehling, head of the K26 office (responsible for organized crime) at Leipzig's criminal investigation department, re-investigated the Klockzin murder attempt, identifying the hitmen's employers who were real estate agents from Bavaria. In the course of the investigation, Wehling found that these estate agents had also blackmailed Klockzin by threatening to reveal his \\"child molesting\\". This aroused Wehling's suspicion that Klockzin might have been a client of the \\"Jasmin\\" brothel and he also re-opened that child prostitution case. Upon his re- examination, the former pimp Michael W. Claimed that his lenient sentence was part of a deal, not to \\"wash his dirty linen\\" in public, i.e. not to identify the brothel's clients during the trial. Moreover, he now claimed that Klockzin as well as the estate agents who had contracted his killing, had been clients of the \\"Jasmin\\" brothel. Consequently, inspector Wehling initiated proceedings for perversion of justice against judge J√ºrgen Niemeyer, who had presided over the trial in 1994. History of the affair The still unsolved affair goes back to what the former forced prostitutes said when being interviewed again by the police in 2000. They claim that the former vice president of the Leipzig's Country Court (Landgericht), who was their judge in the trial of 1994, J√ºrgen Niemeyer, was one of the visitors of the brothel. The women further claim that Norbert R√∂ger, back then public prosecutor in Leipzig, was another former visitor of the brothel. Since January 2011, he is President of the Country Court in Chemnitz (Landgericht Chemnitz).http://www.justiz.sachsen.de/smj/content/2161.php The policemen who conducted the interrogation, later denied to speak publicly about it.Sigrid Reinichs: http://www.zeit.de/2012/10/Mandy-Kinderbordell- Sachsensumpf/komplettansicht In 2003 a department for organized crime (OK) was established in the Saxony State Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Landesamt f√ºr Verfassungsschutz Sachsen - LfV). This unit had ten employees and was headed by the former public prosecutor Simone Henneck (now Skroch). Certain investigations of this unit, which were internally registered under the name 'offside' (German 'Abseits'), had alleged mafia structures in Leipzig as focus. These included suspected illegal property transactions in the 1990s, prostitution, blackmail and cross-links between political, judicial and criminal persons. This part was also associated with the assassination attempt on Klockzin in 1994. From 2004 to 2006 the unit assembled files of 15.600 pages.https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/der-angebliche-sachsensumpf- haltlose-geruechte-ueble-anschuldigungen-1.209508 The jurisdiction of a domestic intelligence agency investigating organized crime was controversial from the start (in Germany this is normally part of specialized police units). In July 2005 the Saxony Constitutional Court (s√§chsischer Verfassungsgerichtshof) declared that the 'State Constitution Protection Act' (Landesverfassungsschutzgesetz) of that time is partly unconstitutional and thus limited the admissibility of observation of organized crime by the department.see: Vf 67-II-04 - quoted in: http://www.verfassungsgerichtshof.sachsen.de/content/911.php On 12 August 2005 a government report was issued. It assessed the situation and concluded, that 'the aspect of a danger for the constitution and the free, basic democratic order in Germany [...] in all case complexes was given'. On the basis of this report the former Minister of the Interior, Thomas de Maizi√®re, decided, that the observation of organized crime, including the case of complex 'offside' by the domestic intelligence agency, will continue. It has been reported that Mr de Maizi√®re appreciated the work of Henneck and her department, but was not initiating a criminal investigation by the Public Prosecutor's Office (Staatsanwaltschaft), nor did he inform the parliament on the available evidence. The report from August indicates, that the Saxony State Office for the Protection of the Constitution (LfV) knew of alleged sexual abuse of children at the hands of known prosecutors and judges by the second quarter of 2005.http://plutokraten.blogspot.com/2009/03/sachsensumpf.htmlhttps://web.archive.org/web/20071015210821/http://rbb- online.de/_/kontraste/beitrag_jsp/key=rbb_beitrag_6077948.html In March 2006, the Data Protection Supervisor (Datenschutzbeauftragter) of the Free State of Saxony, Andreas Schurig, launched a review in how far the department for organized crime (OK) still collects data - because it only had a limited mandate to monitor organized crime. He concluded, that the documents were collected illegally and should be destroyed. The department was disbanded in 2006. On 15 May 2007 the Parliamentary Control Commission (Parlamentarische Kontrollkommission) of the Saxony Parliament decided, in accordance with Albrecht Buttolo (who followed Mr de Maiziere as Minister for the Interior in November 2005), that the material is not to be deleted, but should be used to further clarify the identified issues. Also in May 2007, the first media reports surfaced on the content of the files from the disbanded department and the so-called 'offside' case complex. There the names Niemeyer and R√∂ger appeared as potential customers in the brothel.Sabine Beikler: http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/deutschland/korruptionsaffaere-in-sachsen- die-dunkle-seite-der-macht/980400.html In a speech at a special meeting of the Saxony parliament on 5 June 2007, the Minister for the Interior Mr Buttolo confirmed the existence of active and dangerous criminal networks in Saxony, this speech became known as the 'Mafia-Speech'.Thomas Schade, Gunnar Saft: http://www.sz-online.de/nachrichten/minister-buttolo-warnt-vor- mafia-1534097.html The General Attorney's Office of Germany (Bundesanwaltschaft) was informed and had a look into the issue, but in June 2007 declared, that there is no reasonable suspicion for the existence of a criminal organization or network.Reiner Burger: https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/sachsen-erhebliche-maengel-im- verfassungsschutz-1463845.html The Prosecuting Attorney's Office of Dresden (Staatsanwaltschaft Dresden) began to investigate against judge J√ºrgen Niemeyer on the basis of obstruction of justice in the time between end of June to early July 2007. It received intelligence files from 'offside III' complex. In early July 2007, when the so-called 'Saxony corruption affair' or 'Saxony morass' became a topic in the national media, the Saxony State Office for the Protection of the Constitution, whose oversight was recently given to Reinhard Boos, assumed that the head of the department for organized crime, Simone Henneck, had tampered with the files. She made it look like that reports, which were exclusively based on the information from Detective Chief Inspector Georg Wehling, have been supported by other neutral sources. After that, an internal investigation against Henneck was initiated. Chief prosecutor Christian Avenarius, spokesman for the Prosecuting Attorney's Office of Dresden (Staatsanwaltschaft Dresden), said that the material from the police officer hardly contained any reliable facts that would make legal proceedings reasonable.Alexander Wendt: http://www.focus.de/magazin/archiv/sachsen-affaere-nichts-als-aufgepeppte- dossiers_aid_225495.html On the 26 August 2007, two months after his 'Mafia- Speech', Albrecht Buttolo distanced himself from what he said in that speech. At the time he completely trusted the accuracy of the material, now however, under the given circumstances of significant errors in the interpretation the material, he considers the information questionable. Data collection and data analysis was put together and a check for the credibility of the information has not been made. The reports filed by the chief inspector did not stand tests by the Prosecuting Attorney's Office (Staatsanwaltschaft) and the State Office for Criminal Investigations (Landeskriminalamt). Many references were false or overstated.Hubert Kemper: http://www.freiepresse.de/THEMEN/6-August- Buttolo-distanziert-sich-von-Mafia-Rede- artikel987581.phphttp://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/korruptionsaffaere- sachsens-innenminister-will-von-mafia-rede-nichts-mehr-wissen-a-498636.html An external review committee headed by the retired judge from the Federal Court (Bundesgerichtshof) Dietrich Beyer, stated in its interim report serious deficiencies at Saxony's State Office for the Protection of the Constitution, particularly with the department for organized crime (OK). Intelligence service regulations have been violated to a significant extent, the supervision of the department has been neglected by both the board of directors as well as the Ministry of the Interior (Innenministerium). Members of the unit had insufficient intelligence training for obtaining information, policemen from the mid-level service had been used. The head of the department itself had not any specialized training or further education. Source reports were not questioned on their resilience, even self-evident inconclusive information has been processed as applicable. Contrary to corresponding units in other federal states, who analyze data to advise the government and coordinate with the police authorities, the unit of Saxony tried to find suspicious circumstances at any price and individual employees acted 'grimly' and 'overeager'. The result was a 'disaster'.http://www.freiepresse.de/THEMEN/Massive-Kritik-am- Verfassungsschutz-artikel1009179.php In a 2008 lawsuit, the two girls who were forced into prostitution declared that the high-level lawyers of Leipzig were their punters in the Jasmine.Thomas Datt, Arndt Ginzel: http://www.zeit.de/online/2008/27/sachsensumpf-jasmin The convicted pimp Martin Kugler testified that his lawyer back then agreed with the court on a lenient sentence, provided that Kugler will not wash 'dirty linen'.Thomas Datt, Arndt Ginzel However, this assertion was later revoked by Kugler. The Public Prosecutor's Office (Staatsanwaltschaft) gave no credibility to the testimony of the women and cancelled the investigation against the lawyers; both lawyers received compensation from the state of Saxony. The investigating officers were shifted, the commissariat K26 was dissolved. In addition, several legal proceedings against Georg Wehling, the former head of K26 were initiated and he was suspended from duty. These proceedings were mostly closed, one ended in acquittal. A lawsuit was initiated on 15 December 2011 against the former forced prostitutes who testified as witnesses in the trial against the lawyers on the basis of libel.J√∂rg Schurig: http://www.sz- online.de/nachrichten/artikel.asp?id=3005526 That process was officially opened on 6 March 2012,http://www.l-iz.de/Politik/Sachsen/2012/03/Artikel-im- ZEIT-Magazin-ueber-Sachsensumpf-40521.html and ended on the third day without sentencing on the advice of a psychologist.https://www.berliner- zeitung.de/sachsensumpf-affaere-vorlaeufiges-ende-einer-verleumdungsklage- li.64950 Investigation committee A connection with the inconsistencies on the so-called 'ownerless properties', which were sold in Leipzig during the past few years in the hundreds, has not been demonstrated, but is examined by a group of parliamentarians of the Saxony parliament. It is checked whether the same group of people involved in that do play a role in the Saxony morass as well. However, to that parliamentary committee (Landtagsuntersuchungsausschuss) for the inquiry of the 'Saxony morass' the city of Leipzig presents a -No-, when it comes to the question of accessing corresponding files in the archive. Mayor Jung was citing an evaluation from which making these files public would be unlawful, because they are not part of the investigation.http://www.lvz- online.de/leipzig/citynews/immobilienskandal-um-herrenlose-grundstuecke-in- leipzig--aufklaerung-2013-moeglich/r-citynews-a-162225.html Simone Skroch (formerly Henneck), former Head of the department organized crime at the LfV, confirmed as a key witness in the investigation committee of the 'Landtag' (legislative assembly in Germany) beginning in March 2013, that the 'existence of continuously acting structures of the former Ministry of State Security (Ministerium f√ºr Staatssicherheit - MfS / DDR) in complex connection with organized crime' is given. Ms Skroch revered to economy, public administration and the sex trade business. There has actually been leads 'that from people within the organized crime, consciously and purposefully situations were set up to blackmail individuals, partially in conjunction with bribery and corruption'. The goal of these proceedings was to bring certain groups like staffers, public officials, politicians and other representatives of public life into 'dependencies'. Yet in March 2013, she still faced disciplinary and judicial inquiry. On 2 July 2014, the political parties of SPD, Greens and the Left proclaimed their findings on the 'Saxony morass'.They stated that there was no viable evidence for the existence 'of a corrupt network'. However, they complained that the government had not seriously run the enlightenment of the affair, but had even prevented it. In the process several employees were affected and were 'downright destroyed in their professional and social status'.http://www.gruene-fraktion- sachsen.de/fileadmin/user_upload/ua/Minderheitenberich_UA-Sachsensumpf_Gruene- SPD-Linke_2014-07.pdf  Coverage and legal consequences  From the summer of 2007 J√ºrgen Roth reported on the 'Saxony morass' affair (suspicion of involvement in mafia-like structures from high politicians, lawyers, policemen and journalists).Markus Bernhardt: http://www.jungewelt.de/2009/06-26/054.php For his covering Roth was severely criticised by journalist Reiner Burger in a series of articles in the FAZ (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung). Burger demonstrated that Roth has not spoken with affected people directly, as example. In this context, Roth had to retract statements on his website about a businessman. The district court in Dresden sentenced him in early 2008 to a fine for libel. A critical comment on the situation from J√ºrgen Roth was published on the website 'mafialand.de'.http://www.jungewelt.de/2009/07-10/049.php The investigative committee of the Saxony Landtag in 2009 came to no conclusive result on the Saxony morass. CDU and FDP party saw it as disproved, Greens and The Left could find no evidence for or against it. Access to records was widely withheld from the investigative committee by the state government. The Public Prosecutor's Office will not further investigate into the 'Saxony morass', since it sees the allegations as refuted.https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland-in-kuerze-1996456.html There are, however, single politicians that see the situation very critical, and those politicians are in favour for further investigating of the affair and the criminal network in Saxony.https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFtVq8VhqGkmt7pE6WDiKNQ The journalists Arndt Ginzel and Thomas Datt reported in the German 'Spiegel' and 'Zeit Online' on the case. Both were accused of libel and defamation. Amongst other things they were accused of defamatory allegations against the Saxon lawyers. In one case, they were condemned by the district court of Dresden on 13 August 2010 to a fine of 50 daily rates of 50 ‚Ç¨ / 2500 ‚Ç¨, which the two journalists were disputing.Az. 231 Cs 900 Js 28869/08 - http://openjur.de/u/59830.html openJur 2010, 3256 On 10 December 2012 the Regional Court did reverse that ruling.Az. 12 Ns 900 Js 28869/08 http://openjur.de/u/599629.html openJur 2013, 4644 The presiding judge Martin Schultze-Griebler took the view, that under established practice of the higher law, media utterances are to be seen in context of the situation.http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/sachsensumpf-landgericht- spricht-arndt-ginzel-und-thomas-datt-frei-a-872082.html Finally, after the General Attorney of the Free State of Saxony has withdrawn a previously given objection, that ruling is legally valid.http://www.sz- online.de/sachsen/sachsensumpf-freispruch-rechtskraeftig-2615958.html On the occasion of the libel trial against the women that were forced into prostitution, Jana Simon and Sigrid Reinichs of the 'Zeitmagazin' were again reporting on the topic. They especially shine a light on the situation of Mandy Kopp, who was forced into prostitution at age 16 in the brothel. In November 2008 Beatrice E., who was forced to 'work' in the brothel along with Mandy Kopp, was accused of libel as well. Both accused J√ºrgen Niemeyer of being a visitor to the brothel in the 90s.http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/sachsensumpf-prozess-gegen-jasmin- zwangsprostituierte-geht-weiter-a-866143.html That process was discontinued in October 2013. The Annual Report 2012/13 from Reporters Without Borders called the lawsuit against journalists in the 'Saxony morass' as one of five reasons for a slightly deteriorated assessment of press freedom in Germany (at that time 17th place among 179 countries on the global rankinglist).https://www.reporter-ohne- grenzen.de/fileadmin/rte/docs/2013/130130_Nahaufnahme-Deutschland_layouted.pdf Martin Klockzin started a lawsuit against a report in the online edition of the 'Stern' magazin on 22 June 2007 which was released under the title 'The Saxony corruption scandal: A thriller from Leipzig's morass'. He had success against the publisher, the journalist and his own former secretary. He demanded the payment of a compensation for infringing his personality rights. The opinion of the final ruling was, that the report in the magazine was onesided in favour for the view of his former secretary. Klockzin did reject the request for an interview on the issue in the first place, however, he was not informed what exact the allegations were, which finally have been noted down in the article. The article has therefore given the impression, that Klockzin 'was a pedophile, had a sexual relationship with an underage girl named Lissy, was corrupt, part of a criminal network in Leipzig, did not fulfill his duties and that he threatened his former secretary by writing her short messages whose content was, to strangle her cat and to push her car of the road with the help of three motorcyclists known to him'. It was not possible to prove these allegations and therefore he was unlawfully insulted in his honor. The Country Court awarded a monetary compensation in the amount of 75.000 Euro, which was reduced later by the Higher Regional Court (Oberlandesgericht - OLG) to the amount of 50.000 Euro.see ruling on 17 December 2013: File Reference VI ZR 211/12 - http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi- bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&Art;=en&nr;=66571&pos;=0&anz;=1 Later the Federal High Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) basically confirmed Klockzin's right to claim a compensation, but at the same time criticized errors in the calculation of the actual amount and gave the case back to the previous court. In Germany's juristic literature this ruling is quoted as leading decision on issues of monetary compensation for violations of personal rights by statements on the Internet. The 'Lausitzer Rundschau' published an article on 3 July 2014, titled: 'Saxony morass affair: Clear is as good as nothing'. The report was about the end of the process, citing John Lichdi of the political party 'The Greens': 'The investigation against the accused prosecutors and judges was never operated seriously and was handled to end with no decent result from the beginning.' http://www.lr- online.de/nachrichten/sachsen/Sachsensumpf-Affaere-Geklaert-ist-so-gut-wie- nichts;art1047,4658706 Also the newspaper 'Welt am Sonntag' published an article on the occasion of the final report from the investigative committee in October 2014. There it was noted, that many questions do remain unanswered. It is remarkable how hard the Saxony's judicial authorities pushed against those - especially journalists - who doubted the official explanation and still believed in the existence of criminal structures.https://www.welt.de/print/wams/politik/article132837576/Dichter- Nebel-ueber-dem-Sachsensumpf.html Literature * Gunter Pirntke: 'Black Morass in Saxony: A cartel of corruption and cover-up' - 'Schwarzer Sumpf in Sachsen: Ein Kartell aus Korruption und Vertuschung' Grin Verlag, M√ºnchen 2012, erweiterte, aktualisierte Ausgabe, * Mandy Kopp: 'The time of silence is over' - 'Die Zeit des Schweigens ist vorbei' Berlin: Marion von Schr√∂der Verlag 2013, Other sources *http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/sachsensumpf-wie-die-justiz-mandy-kopp- stigmatisierte-a-891227.html *http://www.mafialand.de/inhalt/zusammenfassung/schlagwoerter/sachsensumpf *http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2012-11/Sachsensumpf-Prozess-Mandy- Kopp *http://www.zeit.de/online/2007/47/sachsen-affaere *http://www.zeit.de/online/2008/27/sachsensumpf-jasmin *https://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/medien/medien-der-sachsen-sumpf-ist- ausgetrocknet-1547373.html References Category:20th-century scandals Category:21st-century scandals Category:Political scandals in Germany Category:Politics of Saxony ","title":"Sachsensumpf"},{"id":"44933832","text":"The 2012 Harlow District Council election took place on 3 May 2012 to elect members of Harlow District Council in Essex, England.

Witness protection in Ireland is used in cases of serious, organised crime and terrorism. The programme is under the operational control of the elite Garda Special Detective Unit (SDU), attached to the Garda Crime & Security Branch (CSB). Structure and operation The Garda Witness Protection Unit is the small, dedicated and highly secretive group that runs the Witness Security Programme. The Witness Protection Unit is a subsection of the Special Detective Unit, which falls under the remit of the Crime and Security Branch at Garda Headquarters. The unit is headed by a Detective Inspector, who is answerable to the Detective Chief Superintendent in charge of the SDU, the Assistant Commissioner in charge of Crime and Security and ultimately the Garda Commissioner. All detectives attached to witness protection duties are heavily armed. Further reinforcements can be drawn from the SDU when there is a need. According to the Department of Justice and Equality, the Garda Witness Security Programme is operated in \\"a significant number\\" of cases, although no details were released as to how many participants are currently under the protection of the programme. The annual budget for the programme was ‚Ç¨1.198 million in 2013, and was expected to be the same in 2014. The Witness Security Programme operates nationally, and was officially established in 1997, following the assassination of journalist Veronica Guerin by a drugs gang she was reporting on, and the subsequent trial that followed, whereby a gang member turned state's witness. The programme is designed to protect witnesses before, during and after court trials against attempts by criminal and other groups to prevent the normal functioning of the criminal justice system, including threats of violence and systematic witness intimidation, and where otherwise the witnesses may refuse to testify. In circumstances where the Senior Investigation Officer (Garda S√≠och√°na) in a case has identified a witness who is crucial to the case and the evidence to be proffered is not available elsewhere, and where there is a credible threat to the life of the witness and/or their family, an application can be made - with the consent of the witness - to have them included in the Witness Security Programme. Relatives of those who are under the protection of the programme may be protected and relocated if their safety is deemed to be at risk. The majority of those in the programme have been involved in criminal activity themselves. The Minister for Justice and Equality will only grant protection to those who cooperate with investigations conducted by the Garda S√≠och√°na. According to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), it is estimated that 25% of crimes in Ireland are not reported due to intimidation, and one in 10 crimes reported to Garda√≠ result in overt intimidation against witnesses, often culminating in the collapse of prosecutions. Witnesses in the programme are given a new identity, address and armed police protection either in Ireland or abroad (generally in Anglophone countries, such as the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and mainland Europe). Law enforcement in host countries may cooperate with the Garda S√≠och√°na in providing security for witnesses in the programme, such as the United States Marshals Service. Protectees are usually provided with financial assistance, as they must leave their employment. Court appearances by witnesses in protection are carried out under the security of the Garda Emergency Response Unit (ERU), the premier armed tactical operations group in Irish law enforcement (and a section of the SDU). The Irish Prison Service may also be involved in providing security to witnesses if they are in prison at the time. There has never been a reported breach of security in which a protectee was harmed. Legislation Legislation was not required to establish the programme, but its operation is supported by a number of legislative provisions. The intimidation of witnesses is an offence pursuant to Section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999. Section 41 specifies the offence as harming, threatening or menacing, or in any other way intimidating or putting in fear another person who is assisting in the investigation of an offence by the Garda S√≠och√°na, with the intention of causing the investigation or course of justice to be obstructed, perverted or interfered with. The offence is punishable on indictment by a fine and/or a term of imprisonment of up to 15 years. Section 40 of the same Act makes it an offence for any person, without lawful authority, to make an attempt to identify the whereabouts or any new identity of a witness who has been relocated under the programme. The offence is punishable on indictment by a fine and/or a term of imprisonment of up to five years.

Roscommon was first granted to John Crofton during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. He was the first occupier, having been appointed Auditor General in 1584. In addition to this estate he also obtained extensive grants of lands elsewhere in the county as well as in Leitrim and Sligo.Burkes Peerage, 105th, Pg. 1930. It was not until 1661 that a Crofton obtained a title however, when Edward Crofton became a Baronet of the Mote for services rendered to Charles II during the Cromwellian rebellion. This is now a subsidiary title to that of Baron Crofton. The title of Baron Crofton of the Mote is the most senior. It was created in 1797 (as Baroness Crofton) for Dame Anne Crofton. She was the widow of Sir Edward Crofton, 2nd Baronet, of the Mote, who had represented Roscommon in the Irish House of Commons and had been offered a peerage just before his death.Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p. 1067 The peerage was instead bestowed upon his widow. She was succeeded by her grandson, the second Baron, who had already succeeded as fourth Baronet. He sat in the House of Lords as an Irish Representative Peer from 1840 to 1869 and served as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) in the three Conservative administrations of the Earl of Derby and in Benjamin Disraeli's first government. His son, the third Baron, served as an Irish Representative Peer between 1873 and 1912 and was also State Steward to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. His nephew, the fourth Baron, was an Irish Representative Peer from 1916 to 1942. Edward, 3rd baron Crofton, was a noted composer and became a Representative Peer for Ireland in 1873. As of 2014 the titles are held by the latter's great-great-grandson, the eighth Baron, who succeeded his father in 2007.  Crofton of Longford House  This branch is now the older male branch of the Crofton family in Ireland.Burke's Peerage p.690, 105th edition Edward Crofton of Longford House in the County of Sligo was granted a Baronetcy in 1661. However, this title became extinct with Sir Oliver Crofton, 5th Bt. in 1780. The Crofton Baronetcy, of Longford House in the County of Sligo, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 18 August 1838 for Sir James Crofton. Head of the elder male branch of the family, Sir James was also a Major of the Sligo Militia and Deputy Lieutenant of the County. He was descended from Thomas Crofton, uncle of the first Baronet of the 1661 creation. The family seat remains Longford House, Co. Sligo.  Crofton of Mohill  The Croftons of Mohill Castle settled in Ireland in 1643 following a patent from Charles I. Although this branch of the family was of some distinction, they remained untitled until 1801. The Crofton Baronetcy, of Mohill in the County of Leitrim, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 10 August 1801 for Morgan Crofton. The sixth Baronet was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the 2nd Life Guards and fought in the Second Boer War, where he was severely wounded at the Relief of Ladysmith, and in the two world wars. His diaries from the First World War are published as \\"Massacre of the Innocents: The Crofton Diaries, Ypres 1914‚Äì1915\\", 2004. Another member of the family, James Crofton, grandson of Morgan Crofton, third son of the first Baronet, was a Lieutenant-General in the Army. The family seat remains Mohill Castle, Co. Leitrim.  Property The total holdings of the Croftons in Co Roscommon consisted of 11,053 acres, according to the Bateman Edition of Great Landowners of Great Britain and Ireland in 1883. The size of the Mote Park estate in Ballymurray consisted of c.7000 acres. Although this was a sizeable estate, when compared with others such as the Essex properties consisting of the town of Roscommon itself and extensive lands to the north, totalling some 36,000 acres, it clearly was not the largest. Mote Park House was built by the Crofton family in the later half of the eighteenth century, preceding the Castle of Mote erected by the family in 1620. Crofton House (at Mote Park, shown) was clearly an imposing structure and reflects the influence of neo- classicism prevalent at this time. This style emphasises for the first time a sense of permanence and security among the landowning class. The house was the most impressive of its type built in Co. Roscommon, the others of this period being located at Runnamoat near Ballymoe, and Sandford House in Castlerea. The house was originally an irregular two-storey-over-basement house, which the architect Richard Morrison more than doubled in size by adding six bays and an extra storey. It had a deep hall with a screen of columns, beyond which a door flanked by niches led into an oval library in the bow on the garden front. These gardens contained many fine architectural features, some of which are still intact. Perhaps the most splendid surviving feature is the original entrance gate consisting of a Doric triumphal arch surmounted by a lion with screen walls linking two identical lodge houses. In 1865 a fire destroyed the entire house at Mote Park, as another had destroyed their castle a century previously. While the house was being re-built in 1866, the family occupied the old barrack room in the farmyard. Following the death of Lord Henry, his nephew, Arthur Edward Crofton became the last of the Croftons to reside at Mote, but moved to England in the 1940s.

Berga an der Elster was a subcamp of Buchenwald concentration camp. The Berga forced labour camp was located on the outskirts of the village Schliben. Workers were supplied by Buchenwald concentration camp and from a POW camp, Stalag IX-B; the latter contravened the provisions of the Third Geneva Convention and the Hague Treaties. Many prisoners died as a result of malnutrition, sickness (including pulmonary disease due to dust inhalation from tunnelling with explosives), and beatings, including 73 American POWs. The labor camp formed part of Germany's secret plan to transform, via hydrogenation, brown coal into usable fuel for tanks, planes, and other military machinery. However, the camp's additional purpose was Vernichtung durch Arbeit (\\"annihilation through labor\\"), and prisoners were intentionally worked to death under inhumane working and living conditions, and they suffered from starvation as a result. This secondary purpose of extermination was carried out until the war's end, when the prisoners were subjected to a forced death march in order to keep ahead of the advancing allied forces. POWs were put to work, together with concentration camp inmates, digging 17 tunnels for an underground ammunition factory, some of them 150 feet below ground. As a result of the appalling conditions, malnutrition and cold, as well as beatings, 47 prisoners died. The U.S. military authorities never acknowledged the incident. On 4 April, the 300 surviving American prisoners were marched out of the camp ahead of approaching American troops. After a 2¬Ω-week forced march they were finally liberated. During this march another 36 Americans died. During an air raid, while the camp lights were extinguished, Hans Kasten, Joe Littel and Ernst Sinner, escaped from the Berga camp. They were later arrested and taken to Gestapo headquarters. After their identities as POWs were confirmed they were taken to Buchenwald and placed in detention cells. They were freed when KZ Buchenwald was liberated. Berga was run by a reserve army sergeant named Erwin Metz, who was ultimately responsible for the inhumane conditions, and gave the order to take the prisoners on the death march. When the allied forces closed in on the retreating Germans, Metz deserted his post and attempted to escape by bicycle, fearing the consequences of being captured in possession of the remaining Berga prisoners and having to answer for his war crimes. Still, he was captured days after the prisoners were liberated by American forces, and he was sentenced to death, because he had killed a US POW, Pvt Morton Goldstein (Battery C/590th Field Artillery/106 US Division) on March 14, 1945. However, because of the American political climate and the shifting priorities of the American War Department towards defending Western Europe against the Soviets in the lead-up to the Cold War, many German war criminals' sentences were commuted in exchange for intelligence that the Western allies believed could be used against the Soviets. Thus Metz was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment, though in the end he only served nine years before being released back into Germany as a free man.

In a brief racing career he established himself as the leading British juvenile of his generation in 1971 with win in the Group Two Champagne Stakes and the Group One Dewhurst Stakes. He was retired from racing after a single, unsuccessful start in the following spring and had little success as a breeding stallion. Background Crowned Prince was a chestnut horse with a white star and white socks on his hind feethttp://www.sporthorse-data.com/d?showpic=704759&nm;=2&time;=1398441464 bred in Kentucky by Leslie Combs II of Spendthrift Farm and Frank McMahon. He was sired by Raise a Native, an American racehorse who was unbeaten in four races and was named American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt by Turf and Sports Digest in 1963. Crowned Prince's dam Gay Hostess was a highly-successful broodmare, having produced Majestic Prince from a previous coverings by Raise a Native. Her other descendants have included Real Quiet, Caracolero and The Derby winner Secreto. At the Keeneland Sales in July 1970 the yearling was sold for a then world-recond price of $510,000, breaking the record set two years earlier by the filly Reine Enchanteur, with McMahon buying out his partner Combs. Majestic Prince had previously held the record as well as the other Spendthrift graduates One Bold Bid and Bold Discovery. The colt was sent into training with Bernard Van Cutsem at his Stanley House stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. At the time, Van Cutsem was one of the most successful trainers in Britain, handling major winners including Park Top (King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes) and Karabas (Washington, D.C. International Stakes). Racing career As a two-year-old in 1972, Crowned Prince was a member of an exceptional team of juveniles trained by Van Cutsem which also include High Top and Sharpen Up. Crowned Prince won two of his three races. At Doncaster Racecourse in September he contested the Champagne Stakes over seven furlongs. Ridden by Lester Piggott he started the 11/10 favourite and won from the Barry Hills-trained Rheingold. In the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse a month later he was matched against Rheingold and won by five lengths at odds of 4/9. In the following year hear he finished fourth in the Craven Stakes after which he was found to have developed a soft palate problem and was retired from racing. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1971: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the British Free Handicap, Crowned Prince was the best two-year-old of the season by a two-pound margin from his stable companion High Top. The independent Timeform organisation, however, rated him six pounds inferior to Deep Diver. Stud record As a breeding stallion, Crowned Prince stood in Ireland before being exported to Japan.

Similar species are those that produce only isidia, Niebla isidiaescens, Niebla isidiosa, and Niebla usneoides.

Factors that precipitate include genetics, and maternal exposure to teratogens. Genetic causes of m√ºllerian duct anomalies are complicated and uncommon. Inheritance patterns can be autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked disorders. M√ºllerian anomalies can be part of a multiple malformation syndrome. Mullerian anomalies occur as a congenital malformation of the mullerian ducts during embryogenesis. The mullerian ducts are also referred to as paramesonephric ducts, referring to ducts next to (para) the mesonephric (Wolffian) duct during foetal development. Paramesonephric ducts are paired ducts derived from the embryo, and for females develop into the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix and upper two-thirds of the vagina. Embryogenesis of the mullerian ducts play important roles in ensuring normal development of the female reproductive tract. However, when defects in each of the three phases of embryogenesis occur, it results in specific structural malformations which are distinguished according to anatomy into seven classes based on the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) classification system. Class I and II anomalies result from underdevelopment of the two separate primitive uterine, vaginal and cervical pockets due to an arrest of stage one of organogenesis, resulting in underdevelopment of both left and right primitive uterus (class I) or underdevelopment of one of the primitive uterus (class II). Class III and IV anomalies result from failure of midline fusion of the two separate primitive pockets due to an arrest of stage two of organogenesis. Class V and VI anomalies result from failure of degeneration of the midline due to an arrest at stage three of organogenesis. Class VII anomalies are malformations caused by Diethylstilbestrol (DES).  Vaginal agenesis (Mayer‚ÄìRokitansky‚ÄìKuster‚ÄìHauser syndrome) and class I anomalies  Mayer‚ÄìRokitansky‚ÄìKuster‚ÄìHauser (MRKH) syndrome is a class I developmental disorder of the mullerian ducts where the vagina and uterus are underdeveloped or absent. Females with MRHK syndrome have normal chromosome pattern of 46,XX karyotype, with normal functioning ovaries and secondary sex characteristics. Females with MRKH are unable to carry a pregnancy due to a malformed uterus, but can have children via assisted reproduction. MRKH syndrome type 1 results when only reproductive organs such as vagina are affected (vaginal agenesis) and type 2 results when abnormalities develop in other parts of the body such as abnormal kidney formation (unilateral renal agenesis). Causes MRHK syndrome occurs from an arrest in the embryonic development in the first phase of organogenesis, resulting in underdevelopment of one or both the left and right primitive uterus and vagina (agenesis). Specifically, an arrest in the development of the paramesonephric ducts at week seven of gestation is linked to MRHK syndrome. During embryological development of the first phase, two separate uterine, cervical and vaginal pockets develop, following which a transverse septum forms across the caudal aspect in the upper two thirds of the vagina, which will dissolve when the lower one third of the vagina (developed from the urogenital sinus) fuses with the upper two thirds. An arrest at this stage means midline fusion of pockets do not occur and subsequently are unable to develop into a whole uterus, cervix and vagina. Changes in the sequences of DNA bases due to mutations in WNT3, HNF1b and LHX1 are decreased in people with MRKH. Mice with mutant alleles for Wnt4, Wnt5a, Wnt7a and Wnt9b display varying extents of mullerian duct hypoplasia indicating these genes may cause MRKH-like phenotypes in humans. A commonly identified copy number variants (CNVs) deletion of 17q12 is present in both type 1 and type 2 MRKH patients. The deletion of 17q12 results in a loss of 2 specific genes, HNFB and LHX1 at position q12 on chromosome 17 which are linked to mullerian anomalies. Most 17q12 deletions result from genetic mutations in people with no known history of MRHK syndrome in their family.  Clinical presentations and diagnosis  Patients who have not reached puberty are asymptomatic and diagnosis is difficult at this stage as the vagina and uterus are not fully developed. Estrogenization during puberty will increase the size of the uterus and allow for accurate evaluation. Symptomatic patients will present with pain at the uterus area due to infections or abnormal vaginal bleeding with cyclical pelvic pain.  Clinical presentations of septate uterus  Diagnosis of septate uterus is based on ultrasound findings of two endometrial cavities and a smooth contouring of the fundus. The septum separating both endometrial cavities is thin and may descend into the cervix of the vagina. An over extended septum can cause the cervix to be obstructed, allowing pathogens to infect the region resulting in pelvic pain due to inflammation of the cervix. The Mullerian duct can be partially obstructed or fully obstructed. In the case where the Mullerian duct is partially obstructed, a reduced cervix opening obstructs menstrual bleeding flow, causing prolonged menstrual bleeding (hypomenorrhea). When there is complete obstruction, patients will present with absence of menstruation (amenorrhea). For patients where the septum extends longitudinally, bleeding will persist when a tampon is used as there are two vaginal openings, and dyspareunia (pain during intercourse) is common. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful in detecting obstruction of the endometrium due to hematometra, which appears as cavitated uterine buds on images, and are unable to be detected by ultrasound. MRI provides three-dimensional information of both internal and external contours and can differentiate septate from bicornuate uterus and other complex anomalies.  Development defects in other tissues  Illustration of a cross section of a septate uterus in homo sapiens (modern day humans) reflecting an anomalous extension of the septum, resulting in inflammation and hypomenorrhea due to reduction of the cervical opening. Malformation of the mullerian ducts in foetuses can result in exhibition of extragenital anomalies such as urological anomalies that includes unilateral renal agenesis, horseshoe kidneys or malformation of collecting ducts. Skeletal malformations which include congenital dislocation of the hip, malformations of the arms, foot, ribs, hemivertebrae in the lumbar spine and cervical spina bifida are associated with mullerian anomalies. Mutations of homeobox genes HOXA10, HOXA11 and HOXA13 in uterus malformations are also responsible for renal and skeletal developmental anomalies. However, the mechanism of action of these genes has not been established.  Non-surgical treatment  The Frank and Ingram procedure is a common non-operative procedure used to increase function of the vaginal via dilators. The method uses graduated dilators to progressively invaginate the mucosa to dilate the opening, increasing depth and functionality of the vaginal over time. The Ingram modification involves using a bicycle seat positioned between the legs allowing direct contact with the perineum creating pressure on the vagina. Thus, by applying pressure to the mucosa, a neovagina forms. It takes between four months up to several years for complete successful treatment.  Surgical treatment  The McIndoe procedure uses a split-thickness skin graft from the patient where it is placed over an obturator and sewn at the ends to from a tube with one closed end. A transverse incision at the vaginal dimple and a small cavity is made at the level of the peritoneum by the surgeon. The skin graft and obturator are inserted into the vagina vault and secured to the labia minora. Synthetic skin grafts are also an alternative, eliminating the need for skin grafts from patients. The use of dilators post operation for three to six months is required to prevent contraction of the vagina. Complications include skin graft failure due to the formation of a hematoma beneath the graft, postoperative hematoma that prevents the graft from receiving adequate nourishment, rectal perforation and fistula formation. Patients with prior history of vaginal or perineal surgery have higher complication rates. The Sigmoid vaginaplasty procedure uses a segment of the patient's sigmoid colon where one end is pulled down to form a neovagina while the other end is sealed forming a blind pouch. Complications include narrowing of the vaginal (stenosis) and weakening of pelvic floor muscles and ligaments which are unable to support the uterus (uterine prolapse). As the use of dilators are not required for sigmoid vaginoplasty, this treatment is favoured over the McIndoe procedure.  Diethylstilbestrol and class VII anomalies  Diethylstilbestrol (DES) was a synthetic oestrogen supplement introduced in 1938 to decrease miscarriage in the first trimester by enhancing the oestrogen dependent follicular phase and implantation of blastocysts. DES is a known teratogen, by crossing the placenta DES disrupts organogenesis by disorganising uterine muscle layers causing maldevelopment of uterus and uterine tube junctions. This prevents normal columnar ciliated cell formation of the vaginal epithelium and reabsorption of vaginal glands. When absorbed, DES is broken down to produce a transient quinone-like reactive intermediate that alters normal gene function of HOX and WNT, affecting differentiation of mullerian ducts. In utero DES exposure has additionally been linked to epigenetic changes responsible for uterine anomalies such as dysregulation of the homeobox gene HOXA10 by hypermethylation of HOXA10, altering long term expression of genes which controls uterine organogenesis. DES is also an endocrine disrupting compound (EDC) which alters normal hormone responses required for reproductive tract development in foetuses. A dose‚Äìresponse association for DES has not been establish but an association with the time of exposure in utero suggest exposure to DES at a certain embryological stage leads to increase susceptibility to mullerian anomalies. Female foetuses exposed to DES in utero (DES daughters) have abnormalities in development in three areas of the mullerian duct, namely of their uterus, cervix and vagina. DES uterine anomalies include hypoplastic uterus (small uterus), T-shaped uterine cavity and constrictions of the endometrial cavity. DES uterine anomalies vary in extent in different races, with foetuses of African American females being more prone to fibroids development during organogenesis. DES cervical and vaginal anomalies include hypoplasia, collar and hood malformation of the vagina and cervix and is seen in 20% of women exposed to DES.  Epidemiology  The prevalence of vaginal agenesis or class I uterine anomalies is 1:5000 female live births globally. The most prevalent form of vaginal agenesis is Mayer‚ÄìRokitansky‚ÄìKuster‚ÄìHauser (MRKH) syndrome and results in congenital aplasia or hypoplasia of mullerian derived structures. MRKH syndrome account for 5% to 10% of all mullerian anomalies. While septate uterus or class II uterine anomalies account for 3% to 7% of all mullerian anomalies. The prevalence of mullerian anomalies also differs within the female population, occurring in 5.5% of the general population, 8% in sterile females and 13.3% in females with a history of miscarriage. Pathogenesis The stages of Mullerian duct development in the human embryo and its associated outcomes during normal and impaired development. The human female reproductive system consists of the gonads, external genitalia and the Mullerian duct system. Initially in the embryo, both the Wolffian (mesonephric) and Mullerian (paramesonephric) ducts are present, where development of the Wolffian ducts give rise to the male reproductive tract and development of the Mullerian ducts give rise to the female reproductive tract. These ducts are identical until approximately week 6 of embryonic development. In males, the sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene on the Y chromosome suppresses Mullerian duct development, by initiating the production of anti- Mullerian hormone by the Sertoli cells of the testis. The Mullerian ducts only develop in the absence of anti-Mullerian hormone, where the Wolffian ducts regress. Development of the female reproductive tract begins at approximately week 8 of embryonic development, and development of the Mullerian duct system is typically complete by the end of the first trimester. The Mullerian ducts develop to give rise to the fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and upper two- thirds of the vagina. The ovaries are not part of the Mullerian system and arise from primordial germ cells, which develop at the gonadal ridge. The formation of the female reproductive tract via the Mullerian ducts has 3 distinct stages. An array of Mullerian anomalies can occur if any of these processes are arrested or impaired. The first stage of Mullerian duct development is organogenesis, where both Mullerian ducts are formed. If the formation of the Mullerian ducts is impaired or does not occur, this can give rise to uterine, cervical and/or vaginal hypoplasia or agenesis. Mullerian agenesis, also known as the Mayer‚ÄìRokitansky‚ÄìKuster‚ÄìHauser (MRKH) syndrome, results in the congenital absence of the vagina or uterus. Women with MRKH syndrome commonly present with primary amenorrhea, where menstruation does not occur by the age of 16. In the first stage of development, it is also possible for only one Mullerian duct to develop, giving rise to a single uterine horn (unicornuate uterus). Unicornuate uteri commonly develop on the right side, although the reason for this preference remains elusive. The second stage of Mullerian duct development involves the fusion of the inferior portion of the ducts to form the uterus, cervix and upper two-thirds of the vagina. The superior part of the Mullerian ducts do not fuse and form the left and right fallopian tubes. Disruptions to this stage of development can result in didelphys or bicornuate uteri anomalies. In both didelphys and bicornuate uteri, the non-fusion of the Mullerian ducts results in two distinct uterine cavities. The third and final stage of Mullerian duct development is septal resorption. After the lower Mullerian ducts fuse, a central septum is left behind, and this partition must be eliminated to give rise to a single uterine cavity, cervical canal and vaginal canal. Defects in septal resorption may produce a septate uterus or arcuate uterus, where the septum divides the uterine cavity. More than 50% of women with reported Mullerian anomalies have septate uteri. It is common for other developmental defects to occur in conjunction with Mullerian anomalies, including renal, skeletal, auditory and cardiac abnormalities. Causes The causes of Mullerian anomalies are not well-understood. The aetiology of this congenital disease may be multifactorial, with genetics, socioeconomic factors and geographic factors playing a role in dysfunctional Mullerian duct development. Mullerian anomalies likely occur early in development, as the congenital disorder often occurs in association with renal and anorectal disorders. Typically, women with Mullerian abnormalities have a normal female karyotype (46, XX). Most incidences of Mullerian anomalies occur sporadically, with instances of familial inheritance patterns being less common. The genetic component of the disease classically follows an autosomal dominant pattern, with variable rates of genotypic expression. WNT4 signalling WNT4 is a gene that has a crucial role in embryonic development, particularly to ensure the normal formation of the female reproductive system, the kidneys and several endocrine organs. The Wnt4 gene pathway promotes female sexual differentiation, while suppressing male sexual differentiation. Mice lacking Wnt4 display androgenisation, the presence of Wolffian ducts and absence of Mullerian ducts. This effect is mirrored in humans, where mutations in the WNT4 gene has been observed in MRKH syndrome patients, who display hyperandrogenism. Mutations in WNT4 gene are not always present in individuals with Mullerian anomalies or MRKH syndrome, but the WNT4 gene is the only gene that has been clearly implicated in MRKH. TP63 TP63 is a tumour protein encoded by the EMX2 gene, which is expressed in uterine and vaginal epithelium. The TP63 protein is required for epithelial differentiation during Mullerian duct development in utero, by promoting the transcription of particular genes. EMX2 mutations result in incomplete Mullerian fusion. Some women with unicornuate uteri exhibit mutant EMX2 and significantly decreased expression of TP63, implicating TP63 in the fusion stage of Mullerian development. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) DES is a synthetic non-steroidal estrogen that was used during 1940‚Äì1971, to prevent premature births, miscarriage and other pregnancy complications. The use of DES was discontinued after it was established that approximately 69% of females who were exposed to DES in utero had uterine abnormalities. DES has been marked as a teratogen as it results in malformation of the embryo. DES is more potent than steroidal estrogen and binds to cytosolic receptors after crossing the placenta. DES is not metabolised as quickly as endogenous estrogen. DES remains bound to cytosolic receptors for a longer period of time. The extended binding time of DES and the subsequent prolonged activation of its cognate receptors has been suggested to disrupt Mullerian development, resulting in uterine abnormalities. Exposure to DES induced multiple uterine abnormalities including constriction bands, hypoplasticity in the uterine cavity and irregular borders. Females exposed to this teratogen in utero presented most commonly with a T-shaped uterus, resulting in increased rates of ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortions, and an overall increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. Impact on fertility and pregnancy The incidence of individuals with Mullerian anomalies is twice as high in the infertile population than in the fertile population. Women who do experience some obstetric complications usually have trouble maintaining full-term pregnancy, rather than issues with conception. Due to improper development of the uterus and fallopian tubes, pregnancies in women with Mullerian anomalies could result in spontaneous abortions, preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, perinatal mortality, placental abruption and other malpresentations. Advancements in the epidemiology of Mullerian anomalies has resulted in earlier diagnosis and treatment. Uterine obstructions can be surgically repaired or managed to result in successful perinatal outcomes. Normal ovarian function is not interrupted in females with Mullerian anomalies and women with the anomaly have been able to utilise assisted reproductive technologies and a gestational carrier to increase the chance of successful reproductive outcomes. Maintaining pregnancy Physiological changes that occur in conjunction with Mullerian anomalies explain why some women with the disorder experience difficulties maintaining pregnancy. These physiological changes include compromised blood flow to the uterus, low uterine muscle mass and an insufficient cervix. An insufficient flow of blood to the uterus would compromise nutritional supply to the foetus and waste removal from the foetus, and this can explain the heightened occurrence of low foetal birth weight (intrauterine growth restriction) and spontaneous abortions in women with Mullerian anomalies. Women with anomalies such as didelphys and bicornuate uteri present with a decreased uterine size and subsequent lower muscle mass. A diminished uterine capacity reduces the likelihood of the foetus reaching full-term development due to spatial constraints, explaining the higher rates of preterm births observed in women with Mullerian anomalies. The degree to which the Mullerian anomaly impairs the reproductive potential of a woman varies between individuals, and is dependent on the type of anomaly and its severity. Women with minor fusion defects such as arcuate uteri and septate uteri tend to have a lower risk of aversive pregnancy outcome, compared to patients with major fusion defects, such as unicornuate uteri, bicornuate uteri and didelphys uteri. Females with severe agenesis and/or hypoplasia, such as in MRKH syndrome, have an increased chance of poor reproductive outcomes without surgical intervention. Assisted reproductive technologies Women with Mullerian anomalies often utilise assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and embryo transfer (ET), and/or a gestational carrier. Compared to individuals with no uterine anomalies, women with Mullerian anomalies exhibit no differences in number of follicles produced, number of oocytes retrieved, or levels of estrogen produced. The normal follicular function, oocyte population and estrogen levels in women with Mullerian anomalies occurs as normal ovarian function is not compromised in the disease. In patients with uterine anomalies, there may be a chance that the endometrial cavity can be compromised, such that implantation following IVF does not always lead to a successful pregnancy. If an individual has a reduced likelihood of effective implantation, a gestational carrier can be appointed to increase the chance of a successful pregnancy. Women that present with unicornuate uteri may have an increased risk of spontaneous abortions, premature labour and preterm delivery, while individuals with unicornuate uteri may be at risk of ectopic pregnancy. These risks can be minimised if assisted reproductive technologies are utilised. Correcting the anomaly prior to commencing assisted reproductive technologies can increase the possibility of reproductive success by increasing the chance of implantation and reducing the likelihood of complications occurring after pregnancy occurs. A greater rate of successful pregnancies are observed in women with septate uteri when the septum is operated on prior to implantation of the embryo.
