She was the witness and accuser in the witch trial against M√§ret Jonsdotter in 1668, the trial that unleashed the great witch hysteria in Sweden called Stora ov√§sendet (Great Noise), involving a series of witch trials in many parts of the nation and lasting until 1676. Background and accusation Gertrud was the daughter of the farmer Sven Hwass: her last name Svensdotter was a patronymic meaning \\"daughter of Sven\\". In 1664, her mother died in childbirth, and she was sent to √Ñlvdalen in Dalarna to live with her grandfather Jon. When he died the year after, she became the foster daughter of her paternal aunts, Elin Jonsdotter and Chirstin Jonsdotter in √Ösen. Gertrud seems to have been particularly close to Chirstin, who was never involved in the future witch trial or accused herself. In 1652, she had been the target of an investigation by the authorities because she had taken a married man as a lover, a man who refused to end their affair despite the authorities ordering him to do so, but she was never punished for it. The family of Gertrud belonged to the more well off among the peasantry. In the autumn of 1667, Gertrud tended a herd of sheep with the shepherd boy Mats Nilsson. They had a fight, and Gertrud beat Mats up. Later, Mats Nilsson claimed that Gertrud had led the sheep over Eastern Dal√§lven by walking on the water at Hemmans√§ng by √Ösen. She was twelve years old at the time. Gertrud Svensdotter was then interrogated by the priest, Lars Elvius, who encouraged her to say that she had indeed walked on water, and that she had done so by magic, which had been given to her by the Devil. After long talks with the vicar, Gertrud said that while she lived with her parents in Lillh√§rdal in H√§rjedalen, a neighbour's maid had taken her to the Devil. The name of the maid was M√§ret Jonsdotter. Gertrud Svensdotter made a detailed confession to the priest. She claimed that, in 1663, when she was eight, M√§ret had taken her on a walk. They had passed a sand-pit, and then came to a three- way crossroads, where M√§ret had cried out: \\"Thou Devil, come forward!\\" She claimed that Satan had then appeared in the shape of a vicar. They had dined, and the following night, M√§ret had come to Gertrud and smeared her body and one of her father's cows with a red oil, after which they had flown away through the chimney and all the way to Satan. Since then, Gertrud had often visited Blockula, milked cattle with familiars, smeared her feet with oil to walk on water, and taken children to Blockula, where their names had been written in a book with black pages. The reason she had admitted this was that she had met an angel in Blockula, a man in white, who had told her to confess, or else a hunger epidemic would sweep over the kingdom. Gertrud's confession came after another shepherd boy, Erik Eriksson (15 years old), reported that he had a vision in the woods where he was sucked up in the air and saw Gertrud sitting in Blockula with the children she had taken, among them his little sister, and that he had heard an angel and a devil discuss how many people they had in their respective kingdoms, and that Gertrud had taken many to the kingdom of the devil. Erik was only to give his testimony once, but he was given credit by the priest for revealing the whole affair. The confession of Gertrud was the starting point of the famous Mora witch trial and, in the long term, the Swedish witch trials, and the first victim was M√§ret Jonsdotter. Gertrud also pointed out seven others, and the witch trial started in September 1668. This was the beginning of the real witch hunt in Sweden, a country where witch trials had previously been a rarity. The witch trial M√§ret Jonsdotter was called to court to answer to the accusations. She was urged to confess and to name her accomplices. M√§ret denied everything. Witnesses were called forward. The father of Gertrud, Sven Hwass, was one of the witnesses. He claimed that M√§ret had made him sick and exhausted by using him as a riding horse on her visits to Blockula. M√§ret had been a maid at his farm and acted as a mother for Gertrud after the death of his wife, and he had the intention to marry her, but he had been discouraged when, during a trip with her to Dalarna, he had been attacked and beaten up by another of her suitors; his rival was the son of an ensign. M√§ret had then left his household. It was after this incident that Gertrud had been sent away to live with her grandmother's sister in Dalarna. M√§ret had a mark on the little finger of her left hand, which was thought to be the Devil's mark. But the only thing they could make her admit were some harmless practices from folklore. She admitted that she had the practice of \\"reading in salt\\"; when a cow was sick, she gave it salt which she had moved facing the sun in her hand, and read a verse, which she read up in court: \\"Jesus our lord travelled mountains and far, he cured shots and magical shots, shots of water and all that is shot between sky and earth. God's worlds and amen\\" (\\"Shots\\" was referring to sickness). That was all she was prepared to admit. Gertrud and another girl, Anna Olofsdotter, were then called in to give testimony. Anna Olofsdotter also identified M√§ret in a confrontation. The girls told M√§ret that they had confessed because they had come to realise their sins, and that she should do the same, but M√§ret answered their testimony with questions: if she had truly been in Blockula, then why did she not know about it herself? Why would this be hidden from her? In the end, M√§ret asked Gertrud to leave - she did not wish to look upon her anymore. Next, the siblings of M√§ret (her little sister Small M√§ret, sixteen years old, and her brothers Oluf, fourteen years old, and Joen, ten years old), were called to give testimony. Small M√§ret said that her older sister had taken her to Blockula riding backwards on a cow where her name had been written in the book of the Devil with the blood of her left little finger. Big M√§ret had had sex with Satan, and so did Small M√§ret after her ninth birthday. The two sisters milked with familiars and rode cows to slaughter to Blockula every Christmas and Easter. Her little brothers said almost the same thing, except that it was their father Jon who had taken them, and that their big sister would never admit anything. At the testimony of her little siblings, M√§ret Jonsdotter told them that they had forsaken God and were heading for a dark road, and crossed herself. Her little sister and brothers cried and embraced her and pleaded with her to confess to save her soul, as did her mother, the only one in the family who was blameless. M√§ret denied everything, said that she had no idea what they were talking about, and asked God to forgive them. M√§ret's siblings continued their confession by saying that they had not got even halfway to Trondheim, and pointed out a woman in the audience, Karin i √Ñggen, called \\"Widow Karin\\", who was to have rested with them in the cathedral in Trondheim on the way. They continued to point out Karin Bi√∂rsdotter, Oluf Bi√∂rsson, Brita Jonsdotter, Per Nils Anna and M√§ret Persdotter. At the end of the day, ten people were accused. Bl√•kulla The story about the children's stay in the Witches' Sabbath in Bl√•kulla (Bluehill) spread rapidly, and everywhere, children started to talk about it and make up stories. Their confessions were very similar to the first ones that were made by the children in this trial, and were to be a standard for the following witch trials of 1668-1676. In Bl√•kulla, people partied as if at a wedding; they drank, ate, danced and had sex by the light of candles that were placed in vaginas while Satan sat under the table and laughed so that the whole room shook and the fire of hell poured up from a hole in the floor, where you could see the tormented souls in hell. You danced with your backs towards each other, as well as doing everything else backwards, married several people at the same time, and had sex with them and with Satan himself, and with his devils and demons, whose penises were cold and whose sperm was made of water and gave birth to frogs that were swept up from the floor with a broom and were made into butter. When you woke up afterwards, your body ached, the food you had eaten had vanished and made you hungry and the gifts you had received had turned to wood chip. An interesting phenomenon was that the children, except from Satan and his demons, also claimed to have seen angels in Bl√•kulla. Next door to Satan's dining room was the angels' chamber, decorated with benches as if in a church, and completely white from floor to ceiling, from where God himself, dressed in a grey cloak and with a grey beard (\\"Just a Mr Olof in Mo\\", as the children said) cried to them: \\"Come here, you are my children\\". The angels had the claws of birds instead of hands and feet, and they were dressed in surplices of white linen and tight pants, and they pulled the Devil's food away from the children's hands, cried tears as big as peas, and asked them to confess so the witches could be exterminated and send the message that one should not have to work on Thursdays, nor use shirts with frilled sleeves, and not have to sell tobacco above its fairest price. The children's situation was, after all, dubious; they were not only victims of the witches which had kidnapped them. They had also sworn themselves to the Devil, eaten his food and had sex. To claim angelic help was believed to be a way for the children to point out that they were innocent victims, and mention of \\"The White Angels of Bl√•kulla\\" was very popular in the children's testimonies. The court was never very interested in the angels; they asked the children, if the angels really did try to stop them from eating Satan's food, why did they not stop them from doing worse, such as having sex with the demons? Verdict On 1 April 1669, M√§ret Jonsdotter and Widow Karin were judged guilty against their own words. There was a problem, however. Swedish law forbade the execution of anyone who had not confessed their crime, no matter if they were judged guilty or not. Neither of them was willing to admit any guilt, and continued to plead innocent, just as they had done from the day they were accused. This put the court in a dilemma. The use of torture was not applicable in this case. The two women were not aware of the law, and the court therefore decided upon a plan to solve the legal predicament and get them to confess and thereby make it possible to execute them. The priests were to persuade them to confess by using religious arguments; the priests should tell them that they were to be executed whether they confessed or not. But if they confessed, they would receive holy communion, and thereby go straight to heaven. They were to be taken to the place of execution believing this, given the communion, and the execution would thereafter be conducted. If they continued to deny all, however, there would be no choice but to take them back to jail. This whole plan was put into effect and conducted just as described. At the place of execution, M√§ret and Karin were told that they could confess and receive communion, or deny all. Both chose to say no to communion and deny the charges. The frustrated authorities then had no choice but to escort M√§ret Jonsdotter and Karin back to prison. Gertrud Svensdotter and the siblings of M√§ret were flogged and then released. The remaining people accused were acquitted, but the hysteria was hard to stop and more were soon put on trial. Soon, 23 people were put on trial for abducting of children to Satan, and on 19 May 1669, eight people (seven women and one man) were executed at the Mora witch trial as result of the process against M√§ret Jonsdotter. Aftermath Gertrud Svensdotter witnessed the execution of the condemned at the Mora witch trial on 19 May 1669. The year after, she was called upon by vicar Lars Elvius to entertain his fascinated private guests by recanting her testimony. On 9 February 1673 she married her fellow witch trial witness Lars Mattson, four years her senior, and in connection to her wedding, her two unmarried aunts and foster mothers gave her their farm. Gertrud Svensdotter was buried on 1 May 1675, one week after giving birth to a son, Matts, who was also buried on 11 June 1675. The cause of her death is unknown: it may have been childbirth, but it may also have been due to the plague which tormented her part of the country at the time of her death. The witch hysteria continued to rage through the country until the execution of Malin Matsdotter in Stockholm in 1676. In 1677, to avoid any further witch trials, the government ordered the priests to declare, through the churches, that all witches had now been expelled from the country forever. In popular culture Gertrud Svensdotter is one of the 999 mythical, historical and notable women who are displayed on the handmade white tiles of the Heritage Floor as part of Judy Chicago's The Dinner Party art installation (1979). Her name there is, however, erroneously spelled as \\"Gertrude Svensen\\".

History Regulating Lines have been used in early buildings like Notre-Dame de Paris and Michaelangelo‚Äôs Piazza del Campidoglio in Rome, etc. Le Corbusier Front of the Petit Trianon Le Corbusier argues from historical evidence that great architecture of the past has been guided by the use of what came to be known in English as Regulating Lines. These lines, starting at significant areas of the main volumes, could be used to rationalize the placement of features in buildings. Le Corbusier lists off several structures he claims used this, including a speculative ancient temple form, Notre-Dame de Paris, the Campidoglio in Rome, the Petit Trianon, and lastly, his pre-war neoclassical work in Paris and some more contemporary modern buildings. In each case, he attempts to show how the lines augment the fine proportions and add a rational sense of coherence to the buildings. In this way, the order, the function, and the volume of the space are drawn into one architectural moment. Le Corbusier argues that this method aids in formalizing the intuitive sense of aesthetics and integrating human proportions as well. Le Corbusier claims in the text that no architects trained in the Beaux-arts technique use regulating lines, because of contradictory training, but most of the Grand Prix architects did use them, even if they were supplementing the basic techniques.Abraham, Pol. \\"'Vers un architecture' par Le Corbusier-Saungnier,\\" pt. 2, L'Architecte 1, no. 3. 1924, p. 18.

Biography Cormontan began her musical education with the town musician in Arendal, where her father served as a Lutheran pastor. She moved to Copenhagen in 1863 to continue her education and pursue a musical career. Her time there was cut short by the death of her mother in 1865, prompting her return to Arendal to run the household of her father. In the period 1865‚Äì1879 she continued her career in Arendal, giving both vocal and piano concerts, composing works for the piano and voice (a number of which were published by Warmuth, the leading music publisher in the region), and establishing a music lending library. In 1879 she opened a music publishing house, focusing on the works of women composers. In 1886, as a result of a major bank failure and a fire that destroyed the family home, Cormontan was forced to sell her music business and emigrate with her father and sister to the United States, where she continued her musical career. In 1887, shortly after her arrival in Sacred Heart, Minnesota, a train accident impaired Cormontan's mobility and her ability to stand, forcing her to give up voice recitals. She focused instead on piano and organ performances as well as giving music lessons, leading choirs, and continuing her composition work, living first with a married sister in Sacred Heart, then with two brothers in Franklin, Minnesota. The family's economic fortunes slowly declined after 1900. In 1910, at age 70, Theodora Cormontan was the youngest of four surviving unmarried siblings and was the main wage earner in the household. After the deaths of her brothers, Cormontan and her sister entered a home for elderly Norwegian immigrants in Decorah, Iowa in 1917. After her death in 1922, her compositions largely disappeared from view until 2011, when boxes containing her musical legacy were discovered in St. Peter, Minnesota, and recordings of her work were released in Norway, Denmark, and the US.  Early life  Theodora Nicoline Meldal Cormontan was born June 9, 1840 in Beitstad in North Tr√∏ndelag, Norway, the second youngest of seven children of Lutheran minister Even Meldal Schjelderup Cormontan and Louise Augusta Hirsch Cormontan. In 1847 her family moved to Arendal, where her father was appointed to the Trinity Church. She studied music there with F. W. Thoschlag, the town organist and proprietor of a music lending library. In 1863 she moved to Copenhagen to study music. The death of her mother in 1865 forced her return to Arendal to run the household of her father, who had taken on additional church duties as provst (in English, dean), a senior official in the diocese. Early career and publishing business alt=Scan of handwritten library index card In 1869 Theodora Cormontan concertized as a soprano soloist in a tour that included the Norwegian coastal towns of Grimstad, Kristiansand, Stavanger, and Bergen. The March 6, 1869 Kristiansand newspaper announced that her program would include Charles Gounod's Jewel Song from the opera Faust and Tacea la note placida from Giuseppe Verdi's opera Il Trovatore. A review in the March 9th edition of the newspaper included the following: \\"The concert featured a singer in possession of a full, rich and sonorous soprano voice of a rare and pleasant character. Her singing reflected favorably upon her training; we would particularly note her beautiful and correct intonation . . . All the numbers were received with lively applause that was so powerful that the singer visibly shuddered, and at the end of the concert was moved to tears.\\" Subsequently, Cormontan established a music lending library. Because of the expense of publication, music lending libraries were a common feature of 19th-century musical culture. From 1875‚Äì1879 several of her compositions were published by Warmuth, the leading Scandinavian music publisher of the era. In addition to her vocal and piano concerts, and composing classical piano pieces and songs in Arendal, Cormontan ran a music publishing business from 1879‚Äì1886. Her publishing house specialized in the work of other women composers. This includes Sophie Dedekam, a composer of hymns and popular songs, and Caroline Schytte Jensen, who went on to become a well-known composer of children's songs ‚Äî she was also the mother of Gabriel Scott, a Norwegian poet. Cormontan was the first to publish, in 1885, the first five of what would later become Schytte Jensen's famous collection of children's songs, as well as the highly regarded Katharina M√•nsdotters vaggvisa f√¥r konung Erik XIV (music set to the poem by Zachris Topelius). From the 1870s through 1884, Cormontan's sheet music publications were distributed throughout Norway, Sweden, Denmark. Germany and Russia. Among the pieces she published was a song she dedicated to a younger pianist and composer, Agathe Backer Gr√∏ndahl (her cousin, Nils Backer, was postmaster of Arendal), proclaimed by George Bernard Shaw in 1889 \\"one of the greatest pianists in Europe.\\" Emigration, career in the United States As a result of a major bank failure, as well as a fire that destroyed the family home, the now-retired Reverend Cormontan, along with Theodora and her sister Eivinda, emigrated to America in 1887 to live first with his daughter and then two sons, all of whom had previously emigrated. Upon her arrival Cormontan continued her musical career in Sacred Heart, Minnesota, giving a series of recitals, both piano and voice, and advertising as a music instructor throughout the region. On December 3, 1887, she was injured in a train accident in Granite Falls, Minnesota. She suffered trauma to her spine, and for the remainder of her life she was unable to walk unaided. In 1889, Cormontan brought a civil suit against the railroad involved in her accident. The company, after offering a $500 settlement, contested the suit over a period of several months, to the point where Cormontan's family incurred over $300 in legal fees and related expenses. The legal counsel for the railroad deposed Theodora and her sister Eivinda each for a full day of testimony, in addition to bringing witnesses to cast doubt on the extent of her injury. The jury awarded Cormontan $5,000, and the railroad was also ordered to pay all of her legal expenses. In 1888, Cormontan, her father, and her sister Eivinda moved to Franklin, Minnesota, to live with her older brother, C. G. V. (Gottfred Christian Vogelsang). He held a degree in chemistry from Norway and opened a drug store in Franklin with his brother-in-law, Edward Lyders. The family joined the local Norwegian Synod Church and Cormontan was employed as organist for both that church and another in the area. Rev. Cormontan died in 1893 and was buried in a place of honor next to the Fort Ridgely & Dale Church. Cormontan's train injury compelled her to cease giving voice recitals (which would have required her to stand for extended periods of time), but she continued her career as a music teacher, organist, pianist, choir director, and composer. As a performer in the 1890s, she received highly favorable reviews from numerous local newspapers for her recitals throughout southern Minnesota: her concerts were characterized as a \\"rare treat,\\" with some attendees gathered outside the town hall entrance and listening from open windows. As late as 1910, at age 69, Cormontan was performing at public gatherings such as conventions and public information sessions for the Red Cross and Farmer's Institute, being described as \\"a pianist of rare ability.\\" Cormontan was composing and copyrighting works for piano as late as December 1911. Lutheran Synod Dispute thumb|left|Page 106 from Ungdommens Ven, Norwegian Lutheran song book, Hauge Synod, 1892. Note the hymn is dedicated to Pastor Haugan by Cormontan.|alt=Scan of hymn music and words, in Norwegian From 1890‚Äì1912, Cormontan was involved in a dispute between the Norwegian Synod and the Hauge Synod. The Hauge Synod was pro- temperance and revivalist in nature, and published \\"spirituals\\" in Norwegian as an alternative to the traditional Lutheran hymns of the Norwegian Synod. Cormontan was a member of the Norwegian Synod, and her father had been a long- serving minister and official in the Norwegian Church, parent church of the Norwegian Synod. Cormontan contributed several hymns to the Hauge Synod magazine, Ungdommens Ven, including one she dedicated to Rev. Bernt Haugan, a Hauge Synod minister and temperance advocate. He published, in partnership with Nils Nilsen R√∏nning, a journalist and author, the song book Frydetoner (Joyful Tunes), a collection of songs from the magazine which included Cormontan's contributions. In response, the Norwegian Synod passed resolutions of disapproval in 1896 and 1901, the 1896 resolution declaring \\"Books such as Harpen, by Hoyme and Lund, and Frydetoner, by B. B. Haugan, ought not to be distributed by the Lutheran Publishing House in Decorah.\\" In the period from 1890‚Äì1917, while maintaining her membership first in the Norwegian Synod and then the United Synod, Cormontan's hymns continued to be included in each subsequent edition of Frydetoner, a hymn book that was, despite official disapproval, enormously popular in Norwegian-American communities, going through at least 25 printings. This dispute was not fully resolved until 1917, when the synods agreed to merge (along with a third), forming the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America, although some progress was made in 1913 when the three synods collaborated in producing their first unified hymnal in English, The Lutheran Hymnary. Cormontan's best-known hymn, H√∏gt fr√• den himmelske kl√•ra (\\"High from the Clearing Heavens\\"), remained in the Church of Norway's hymnal, and is still included in current editions. Changes in family fortunes, retirement As an unmarried woman in the 19th century, Cormontan's financial fortunes were closely tied to that of her family. She lived with siblings her entire time in the U.S., first with her married youngest sister Maria and Maria's husband Edward Lyders (a pharmacist in Sacred Heart), then with her older brother in Franklin. While C.G.V. Cormontan (her brother) ran a drugstore in Franklin, the family fortunes were relatively stable. In 1891, after the $5,000 settlement from the railroad lawsuit, the Cormontan family purchased and donated a Packard organ to the Fort Ridgely & Dale Church. After Rev. Cormontan's death in 1893, C.G.V. Cormontan became the head of the household. As he aged, the fortunes of C.G.V. declined until he was forced to close his Madelia, Minnesota drugstore and move to Hanska, Minnesota in 1901 to work for a druggist there. In 1910, the Cormontan household consisted of four siblings, of which Theodora was the youngest at age 70. As was common for the childless elderly in that era, the family slid into poverty and became dependent on county and church assistance to survive. The Cormontan household was listed on county relief records for disbursements to the poor in 1915. Shortly after C.G.V. Cormontan died in 1917, Theodora and her sister Eivinda entered the Aase Haugen \\"Sunset Home for Old People\\" near Decorah, Iowa, a home that had recently opened and was operated by the United Norwegian Lutheran Church. Cormontan died at the Home in 1922 at age 82; her sister Eivinda died there two years later. Both were buried in the Home cemetery. Cormontan's compositions and publications were put in boxes and stored by Mollie Helgerson Schmidt, wife of Rev. Otto Schmidt, the superintendent and founder of the Home. Legacy=Composing legacy= alt=Scan of cover page, translation: Norwegian National Gymnastics Team Celebration March Except for one hymn and one song, Cormontan's musical legacy disappeared from view for the next 80 years. The hymn, H√∏gt fr√• den himmelske kl√•ra (\\"High from the Clearing Heavens\\") remained a standard in the hymnal of the Church of Norway and was covered and released as an MP3 by a Norwegian jazz vocalist in 2011. In 1988 one of Cormontan's songs, \\"Aftend√¶mring\\" (\\"Twilight\\"), was sung by the actor and musical theater performer Christian Steffensen as part of an album of Hans Christian Andersen poems set to music. The song was singled out for special praise in a review of the album in Fanfare magazine, and Steffensen continued to include it in his repertoire, releasing recordings of it in both Danish and English over the next 35 years, most recently re-releasing it in 2012 on the album In Denmark I Was Born (the album includes music by two Norwegian composers, Edvard Grieg and Cormontan). =Library and publishing legacy= Music that Cormontan published in the period 1879‚Äì1886 can be found in the archives of the Aust-Agder kulturhistoriske senter, Arendal, and in the collection of Michael and Bonnie Jorgensen, a Professor of Music at Gustavus Adolphus College, and a professional pianist, respectively. The granddaughter of Mollie Schmidt (wife of the superintendent of the nursing home where Cormontan spent her final years) gifted Cormontan's musical library to the Jorgensens in May, 2011 after a chance meeting in a grocery store in St. Peter, Minnesota. Bonnie and Michael Jorgensen have presented lectures and concerts throughout southern Minnesota and northern Iowa, recorded a number of Cormontan's compositions, and created a website to document Cormontan's story and legacy. On May 28, 2015 the Jorgensens donated Theodora Cormontan's published and manuscript scores to the National Library of Norway in Oslo and performed her music there with a group of musician friends, including Mollie Schmidt's granddaughter. On May 31, 2015 they gave a concert in Cormontan's hometown of Arendal at the Aust-Agder kulturhistoriske senter (KUBEN).\\"Theodora Cormontan: Arendals glemte komponist\\" (in Norwegian).

It has associations with Charles Dickens, and was the location of makers of musical instruments including pianos and harps, as well as furniture and film-makers.  Geography  Berners Street runs approximately 195 metres in a northerly direction from the junction of Oxford Street and Wardour Street to join up with Mortimer Street (formerly Charles Street) and the former Middlesex Hospital (now called Fitzroy Place). The street lies in an area known as Fitzrovia and is considered historically to be in East Marylebone. Twenty one trees were added to Berners Street in 2012.  History  Berners Street was originally developed as a residential street by the Berners Estate in the mid-eighteenth century. John Slater, surveyor of the Berners Estate, wrote in 1918: \\"On 21st May 1738, William Berners let for ninety-nine years to Thomas Huddle the whole frontage of 655 feet to Oxford Street and 100 feet in depth (with the exception of width required for two proposed new streets ‚Äì which would be the present Berners and Newman Streets and a widening of Wells Lane) at a total rent of 4s. per foot per annum. Huddle was to pull down all old buildings and to erect new ones, and Berners was to construct a sewer from Wells Lane to Rathbone Place. Huddle began to build the houses in Oxford Street at once, and apportioned there rents, the first lease for ninety-nine years being granted in 1739. The total annual rent received by the estate for the Oxford Street houses was ¬£135 8s. until the last of the old leases fell in 1838. The sewer referred to still runs under some of the houses in Berners Street and Wells Street, but it is now disused. Between 1750 and 1763 the existing streets on the Estate were laid out: the first lease granted in Newman Street is dated 1750, in Charles Street, now called Mortimer Street, in 1759, in Castle Street and Wells Street in 1760, in Berners Street in 1763, and in Suffolk Street, now called Nassau Street, in 1764. Building must have gone on rapidly, for in 1773 there were existing sixty completed houses in Berners Street, twenty- three in Castle Street, thirty-five in Mortimer Street, exclusive of the Middlesex Hospital, ninety in Newman Street, and twenty-three in Nassau Street. Many of the houses show strongly the influence of the Brothers Adam, and some ceilings, which are very beautiful, were almost certainly from their original designs. A lease for 999 years was granted to the Middlesex Hospital in 1754\\" Edward Walford, wrote in Old and New London (Volume 4), published 1878: \\"Berners Street, so called after the family title of its ground- landlord, runs northward a little to the east of Wells Street. It was built about the middle of the last century, and has always been celebrated as the \\"home and haunt\\" of artists, painters, and sculptors. Among its former residents are to be reckoned Opie, Fuseli, and Sir William Chambers, the latter of whom we have already mentioned in connection with Somerset House. Opie was buried in St. Paul's Cathedral. His second wife, Amelia, the learned Quakeress, was well known by her writings, \\"Tales of Real Life,\\" \\"Poems,\\" \\"Simple Tales,\\" &c.; In this street was the bank in which Fauntleroy, the forger, was a partner. Walford records the proliferation of charitable and medical institutions in Berners Street during the 19th century: \\"Berners Street forms the head-quarters of several foreign and charitable institutions, some of which have been established ever since the last century. In 1788 was founded the Society for the Relief of Widows and Orphans of Medical Men. The Medical and Chirurgical Society was established in 1805, and incorporated in 1834, for the cultivation and promotion of medicine and surgery. The society possesses a good library, numbering some 25,000 volumes. Here, too, are the Obstetrical Society of London, instituted in 1858; and the Pathological Society, founded in 1846. The lastnamed society was instituted for the exhibition and examination of specimens, drawings, microscopic preparations, casts or models of morbid parts, with accompanying written or oral descriptions, illustrative of pathological science. All the above-mentioned medical societies, together with another styled the Clinical Society of London, are accommodated in the same house (No. 53). Adjoining this building (No. 54) is St. Peter's Hospital for Stone. This charitable institution was established in 1860, and its object is to benefit as large a number as possible of suffering poor by affording them, without a letter of recommendation, the advantages of hospital accommodation; to improve medical and surgical knowledge on the subjects specially treated of here, by bringing together a large number of patients suffering from those diseases, and thus affording opportunities for observation and classification; and, in the cases of patients suffering from stone, to investigate the best means of accomplishing its removal with the least possible danger to the life of the patient, and, whenever practicable, to substitute lithotrity for lithotomy. The practice of the hospital is open to all students and members of the profession. At No. 22 are the offices of the Ladies' Sanitary Association, and also the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women. At No. 9 is the Berners Women's Club‚Äîone of the first experiments in this direction. In the same house are the offices of the Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage. The London Association for the Protection of Trade has its office at No. 16.\\" Many of these institutions springing up in proximity to the Middlesex Hospital: \\"In Charles Street, at the top of Berners Street, the view down which it commands, is the Middlesex Hospital. The building, which is of brick, and very extensive, comprises a centre and wings; it is fitted up with baths, laboratory works, ventilating shaft, and, indeed, all the necessary appliances for comfort, &c.; The hospital dates from about ten or twenty years after the splendid bequest of Thomas Guy, the penurious bookseller of Lombard Street. It was first established, in 1745, in Windmill Street, Tottenham Court Road, for sick and lame persons, and for lying-in married women. It was removed, in 1755, to its present site, when it stood among green fields and lanes. Since 1807 the midwifery patients, to the number of nearly a thousand yearly, instead of being received as inmates, are attended at their own homes by the medical officers of the hospital. The cancer wards were founded by a gift of ¬£4,000 from Mr. Samuel Whitbread, in 1807, to which other gifts and legacies were added. A remarkable incident in the history of the hospital is that in 1793 it became a refuge for many of the French royalist emigrants driven from France by the Jacobin Reign of Terror. The buildings were enlarged by new wings constructed in 1775, and again in 1834. Lord Robert Seymour, a zealous and munificent friend of this institution, obtained for it the royal patronage of George IV., which is continued by her present Majesty. The medical school, established in 1835, enjoys a high reputation; it is furnished with a museum of valuable collections. The hospital contains beds for upwards of three hundred patients. Of these twenty-six are devoted to the cancer establishment, instituted in the year 1791, where the patient is allowed to remain \\"until relieved by art or released by death;\\" eight are appropriated to women suffering from diseases peculiar to their sex; the remainder of the beds being set apart for general miscellaneous cases. Upwards of nine hundred lying-in married women are attended at their own habitations, and eighteen thousand out-door patients are relieved every year. The hospital is unendowed. The annual subscriptions amount to not more than ¬£2,355, while of late years the expenditure has been increased by some necessary works of improvement. This hospital has numbered among its surgeons and physicians men of the highest eminence in the medical profession; besides which it has been the cradle of many eminent careers in surgery.\\" Edward Walford evokes something of the street market atmosphere at the corner of Berners Street and Charles Street so vividly described by Henry Mayhew in the 1840s and 50s:London Labour and the London Poor \\"The southern side of Charles Street, which is continued by Goodge Street into Tottenham Court Road, presents a busy appearance, especially on Friday and Saturday evenings; and as one of the few street markets remaining at the West-end, and probably destined at no long interval to disappear, may claim a short notice. To the long row of stallkeepers on its southern side, who display their stores of fish, fruit, and vegetables in hand-barrows and baskets, and on movable slabs, we may apply the words of Henry Mayhew:‚Äî\\"The scene in these parts has more of the character of a fair than of a market. There are hundreds of stalls, and every stall has its one or two lights; either it is illuminated by the intense white light of the new self-generating gas-lamp, or else it is brightened up by the red smoking flame of the old-fashioned grease lamps. One man shows off his yellow haddock with a candle stuck in a bundle of firewood; his neighbour makes his candlestick of a huge turnip, and the tallow gutters over its sides; while the boy shouting 'Eight a penny pears!' has rolled his dip in a thick coat of brown paper, that flares away with the candle. Some stalls are crimson with a fire shining through the holes beneath the baked chestnut stove. Others have handsome octahedral lamps; while a few have a candle shining through a sieve. These, with the sparkling ground-glass of the tea-dealers' shops, and the butchers' gas-lights streaming and fluttering in the wind like flags of flame, pour forth such a flood of light, that at a distance the atmosphere immediately above the spot is as lurid as if the street was on fire.\\" '''' =Jamaica connections= On 2 November 1756, Dr Richard Bathurst delivered his resignation letter to the Board of the Middlesex Hospital, thus: \\"Gentlemen, Being obliged by the Necessity of my Affairs to make a second Voyage to Jamaica, & being uncertain when I shall be able to return, I beg that from this Day you will consider my Place in your Hospital as vacant. I cannot Gentlemen make this Resignation without returning my sincerest thanks for the Distinctions with which I was elected, the Kindness with which my occasional Absence has been permitted, & the Civilities which I have received. I shall always wish Prosperity to the Hospital tho I can no longer attend it, & shall remember all your Favours with that Gratitude which they may justly claim, from Gentlemen. Your most obliged and most humble servant, Richard Bathurst\\" Genealogist Anne M Powers wrote a study of the interchange between 18th century Jamaica and mercantile London in her book and blog 'A Parcel of Ribbons', which gives some insight into Berners Street in colonial times: \\"When Robert Cooper Lee returned to England from Jamaica with his family at the end of August 1771, they lived for a short time at Old Bond Street in London. But within a very few weeks Robert found a house in Berners Street on which he signed a lease for thirty years. Today in Britain anyone who can afford to buy a house also buys the freehold and therefore owns both the house and the land on which it stands. In 18th-century London such a situation was uncommon. Even the very wealthy would sign a lease on a house for anything from a few months (to attend the London social season) to a period of years. Thirty years was common but it could be anything up to ninety-nine years. The London to which the Lee family returned had expanded hugely in the two decades since Robert had left. There were two new bridges across the Thames ‚Äì Westminster Bridge which had been under construction when he left was opened in 1750, Blackfriars Bridge opened in 1769. London Bridge had finally lost its jumble of medieval houses and shops in 1757 and acquired a new and elegant Italian balustrade. In addition to the development of new bridges, London was spreading rapidly outwards, covering areas that had been just fields in Robert‚Äôs youth, and the population had grown from about half a million in 1750 to three quarters of a million two decades later. Once fashionable areas like Covent Garden had gone downhill and were now the haunt of thieves and prostitutes. Their former inhabitants moved westwards, and large areas to the north and south of Oxford Street saw the development of elegant streets and squares, many of which still retain at least some of their Georgian houses. Berners Street runs at right angles to Oxford Street, then still sometimes known as the Oxford Road, and while it later acquired a reputation as a location for artists and writers, there were a number of families with Jamaican connections who settled there and its occupants were generally wealthy and well connected. The houses were new ‚Äì elegant, Georgian terraces with rear access to their stables via Berners Mews. The Lee‚Äôs house at number twenty-six was described as having lofty airy bed chambers of good proportions, servants rooms and numerous closets, lofty capacious drawing room with an elegant chimney piece and stucco cornice, a large dining room and sideboard recess, library, lofty entrance hall, and suitable attached offices well arranged, and supplied with water; standing for two carriages, stabling for five horses and dry arched cellaring. The history of the development of this area goes back to the middle of the previous century when, in 1654, Josias Berners bought an estate in the parish of St Marylebone for ¬£970 from Sir Francis Williamson of Isleworth. Substantial development was carried out in the first half of the eighteenth century by William Berners, and so the family gave their name to the street. The Berners family were connected to Jamaica three times over through the Jarrett family. Three of William Berners‚Äô grandchildren married Jarretts of Orange Valley, Trelawny ‚Äì Maria Berners married Herbert Newton Jarrett (the third of that name), her brother William married Rachel Allen Jarrett (the second of that name) and their brother Henry Denny Berners married Sarah Jarrett. Sarah and Rachel were sisters, Herbert was their father‚Äôs much younger half-brother. But to return to Berners Street! The usual pattern of development in the eighteenth century was for the land owner to lease out parcels of land for development to speculative builders who would erect a group of houses and then lease these on to tenants. Sometimes the builder would merely erect a shell and the interior finishing would be carried out by someone else, often under the direction of the intended tenant. There was no requirement for consistency in the appearance of the houses, although the fashion for classical proportions to some extent encouraged it. Unlike today no planning permission was required and there were effectively few building regulations to control the quality of the build. There were some regulations relating for example to the materials of construction and the width of streets that had followed from the Great Fire of London in 1666. It is for this reason that these elegant Georgian houses were generally constructed of brick, the brick earth being dug from the very substantial clay deposits which surround London. For example the small town of Ware in Hertfordshire had substantial brick fields and a good line of transport for the bricks into London by barge down the Lea navigation (at the end of which today stands the Olympic Park). Among the owners of land in Marylebone were the Dukes of Chandos, of Devonshire and of Portland whose names are commemorated today in its streets and squares. You can read a contemporary description of the area‚Äôs development written at the end of the 18th century by Daniel Lysons whose Environs of London is a wonderful source of information on 18th century London. The extent of settlement in the area by members of the Plantocracy is evidenced by the numbers of records in the parish registers of St Marylebone, for their baptisms, marriages and burials. Later in the century these wealthy occupants moved gradually northwards as development continued over the old Marylebone Gardens, once an elegant walking place but now overtaken by the profits to be made from development. Even Robert Cooper Lee moved on. Though he retained the lease on the Berners Street house, he moved to the newly completed Bedford Square, also occupied by Jamaican ex-pats such as Marchant Tubb, and members of the Hibbert family. Although Bedford Square ... remains largely unchanged, Robert Cooper Lee‚Äôs Berners Street house is long gone, along with much of 18th century London, replaced by Victorian apartments, flattened by wartime bombs, rebuilt after the war and replaced again by glass and steel tower blocks.\\" Legacies of British Slave- ownership The UCL Legacies of British Slave-ownership projectLegacies of British Slave-ownership explores the mechanisms by which wealth flowed from Caribbean plantations to metropolitan Britain. One such mechanism was the payment by UK taxpayers of approximately ¬£10 million to compensate slave- owners after the abolition of slavery in the United Kingdom's American possessions in 1834. A map of beneficiaries in Bloomsbury and FitzroviaFitzrovia in the Slave Compensation Records shows beneficiaries in Berners Street included: * John Elmslie, 21 Berners Street There were claims for two large estates in Jamaica by the heirs of John Elmslie, who had died in August 1822Ancestry.com, London, England, Deaths and Burials, 1813‚Äì1980 [database online] shows John Elmslie of Berners Street aged 83 buried at Lewisham St Mary 31 August 1822; the will of John Elmslie of Berners Street was proved 2 November 1822, PROB 11/1663. Cited at https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/46127 accessed 16 February 2016 (St George no 324 and St Thomas-in-the-East no 468, total of ¬£9176 7s 10d for 508 enslaved). In addition, compensation for St Thomas-in-the-East no 469 was awarded to the executors and executrix of John Elmslie junior, who had died in July 1829 (¬£2566 4s. 5d for 133 enslaved). Among the heirs of John Elmslie senior listed in Boyle's Directory of 1835 were his eldest surviving son James Elmslie at 18 Upper Gower Street, London; Mrs Elmslie, widow of his second son John junior, at 9 Upper Gloucester Place, London; and William Elmslie, fourth surviving son, at 24 York Street, Portman Square, London. * Andrew Robertson, 19 Berners Street Counterclaimed for 2 enslaved in Barbados (claim # 299) in right of his wife Ann Philips Boxill, stating that the late Rebecca Rowe who died in December 1831 bequeathed all her property to the said Ann Philips Boxill ‚Äòand two other persons‚Äô (T71/895). His address is given as 19 Berners Street. The award was made to the initial claimant, Thomas Boxill, as executor of Rebecca Rowe. Andrew Robertson of 19 Berners Street lodged another unsuccessful counterclaim with his wife Ann Phillips Robertson as legatee and annuitant under the will of Samuel Boxill (Barbados #264). This claim is for 122 enslaved on the Waterford Estate, Barbados. Samuel Boxill sold the enslaved to James D. Maycock, and the claim is awarded to Richard Deane as executor of John Higginson, surviving partner of Sir William Barton and George Irlam, creditors of Maycock. * Rev. Stephen Isaacson, Berners Street Claimant in right of his wife Anna Maria Miller Killikenny [sic] of ¬£60 4s 0d for 3 enslaved on Barbados (claim # 2432). Tentative identification as Rev Stephen Isaacson of Berners Street, on the provisional committee of the Cheltenam, Oxford and Brighton Junction Railway, and director of Galway & Ennis Railways (Times, 7 October 1845, p. 13). P. Kilkelly, ‚Äòmerchant, of Barbadoes, Tavistock Square, is also on the provisional committee of the Barbados General Railway. The UCL researchers commented: \\"We know that in addition to the many absentee planters, bankers and financiers directly concerned with the business of sugar and slavery, there were many other types of claimant: clergymen, for example, or the widows and single women, some of whom had been left property in the enslaved in trust. Slave ownership was spread across the British Isles, by no means confined to the old slaving ports, and included men and women of varied ages, ranging from the aristocracy and gentry to sections of the middle classes. Despite the popular enthusiasm for abolition, slave owners had no compunction in seeking compensation ‚Äì apparently totally unembarrassed by this property that had been widely constructed by abolitionists as a 'stain on the nation'. =Berners Street Hoax= The street was given notoriety by a practical joke, known as the Berners Street Hoax, perpetrated by the writer Theodore Hook in 1809. Hook had made a bet with his friend, Samuel Beazley, that he could transform any house in London into the most talked-about address in a week, which he achieved by sending out thousands of letters in the name of Mrs Tottenham, who lived at 54 Berners Street, requesting deliveries, visitors, and assistance. Hook stationed himself in the house directly opposite 54 Berners Street, from where he and his friend spent the day watching the chaos unfold. The site at 54 Berners Street is now occupied by the Sanderson Hotel. =Charles Booth= In October 1898, Charles Booth took a series of walks with Police Constable R.J. French of the Tottenham Court Road subdivision of the D police division and recorded observations in his notebooks for Life and Labour of the People of London. On 21 October he walked with PC French around 'District 3' including the area 'bounded on the North by Mortimer Street and Goodge St. on the East by Charlotte St. and Rathbone Place, on the South by Oxford Street and on the West by Regent St. being part of the parishes of All Souls and All Saints.' Setting out from the corner of Goodge Street and Charlotte Street he walked north up Berners Street noting only \\"4 1/2 storeys, centre for music establishments, piano, instrument, music publishers etc.\\" Notable residents=Arts= * William Chambers, the architect and interior decorator, was able to build himself a house \\"in his own speculation\\", at 13, Berners Street, along with two adjacent houses, no. 14 for James Lacy and no. 15 for Thomas Rouse, all begun in 1764. According to his biographer John Harris, \\"Chambers's garden is terminated on the mews by a stable and adjacent a large room that must have been his drawing office, allowing access from the mews for the assistants. The rear of his house was decorated in papier m√¢ch√© in a 'fanciful', perhaps Chinoiserie, style. Images of some of Chambers' interiors are held in the RIBA library.Berners Street (Collins) Album * Thomas Collins, an ornamental plasterer who worked for, and was a friend and partner of Sir William Chambers. * John Opie, the historical and portrait artist (8, Berners Street) until his death in 1807 * Henry Fuseli, the Swiss painter and draughtsman (13, Berners Street, the former home of William Chambers) 1803‚Äì =Literature= Berners Street is strongly associated with the writer Charles Dickens. Dickens' maternal great aunt, Mrs Charles Charlton, ran a lodging house at 16 Berners Street, and Dickens was often taken here by his mother, and got a job as a result in 1827. One of the lodgers was a young lawyer called Edward Blackmore, who was impressed by the youngster and employed him as a solicitor's clerk at Ellis & Blackmore in Grays Inn at the age of 15 (for more than twice the pay of Dickens' dreaded, and latterly famous, blacking factory job). It was in Berners Street that, as a boy, Dickens' saw a wandering woman, upon whom the character Miss Havisham from Great Expectations was based. Dickens described her as \\"a conceited old creature, cold and formal in manner\\" who was \\"dressed entirely in white with a ghastly white plaiting round her head and face inside her white bonnet.\\" He added that she \\"went simpering mad on personal grounds alone ‚Äì no doubt because a wealthy Quaker wouldn't marry her. This is her bridal dress. She is always walking up here‚Ä¶ we observe in her mincing step and fishy eye that she intends to lead him a sharp life.\\" This was in his essay \\"Where We Stopped Growing\\" which was published in Household Words on 1 January 1853. Later in life, at 31 Berners Street, Dickens installed his secret young lover, the actress Ellen Lawless Ternan (nicknamed Nelly), who at 19 was 27 years younger than him, and the same age as his eldest daughter. It was September 1858 when she moved in accompanied by her mother Francis, who was an actress, and two sisters, Maria, another actress, and Fanny, a singer. After just a month Ellen and Maria reported to him that they were being pestered by a policeman, whom Dickens suspected of having been bribed by a man sexually interested in either or both of them. He complained of this \\"extraordinary, and dangerous and unwarrantable conduct in a policeman\\" whom he thought should be dismissed. But fear of publicity prevented him pursuing it. Perhaps that was why they all moved in March 1859 to Ampthill Square. Ellen had a habit of wearing scarlet geraniums and white heather in her hair. She was persuaded to give up acting by Dickens in August 1859, and received regular payments from his Coutts Bank account. On her death at the age of 75, she was buried in Southsea, close to where Dickens was born. * Ellen Ternan, actress and mistress of Charles Dickens (31, Berners Street) * Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the poet (71, Berners Street) =Other residents= *Robert Cooper Lee (26, Berners Street) 30-year lease from 1771, subsequently moved to Bedford Square *John Slater, FRSA, architect and surveyor to the Berners Estate (46, Berners Street), c. 1891 By the end of the nineteenth century the area around Berners Street was no longer completely residential and development plots were being amalgamated for the erection of larger commercial and semi-industrial buildings or for mansion blocks of flats.

In Baja California it can be found along a coastal strip extending south of the border from Tijuana to Colonet. In 1979 it was described as \\"locally common\\" in this region. More recently, the area has undergone development and cattle grazing and there are now fewer populations. Hazardia orcuttii is a rare species faces a number of threats to its survival. Though the California population is within a protected area, it is not necessarily safe from habitat degradation. There are trails used by hikers and bicyclists, and off-leash dogs have been noted to disturb the habitat. Efforts are underway to prevent damage to the habitat. Plants have been noted to suffer damage from an insect or a fungus, as well; little is known about this factor. Also, the California population is quite vulnerable to wildfire, being located in a fire-adapted ecosystem which has not burned recently. In Mexico, rapid coastal development has altered the local habitat. None of the species' Baja occurrences are protected.

In 1855 he then opened a fishery company on the banks of the Caspian sea which employed 2,500 people.Caucasian calendar 1863, Tbilisi, 1862., P. 397 Oil business In the years between 1821 and 1872, the Russian Czarist government maintained a monopoly over the Apsheron peninsula's oil fields. In 1863, through governments concessions, Mirzoev opened the first oil refinery in the Apsheron peninsula. Mirzoev, who held concessions in Apsheron since 1863, immediately took up the opportunity to build his own drilling sites once the monopoly of the Russian government ended in 1872. In Surakhani Mirzoev founded two kerosene factories and produced 160 thousand tons of kerosene, amounting to 260 thousand rubles. This project made him the first exporter of petroleum out of Azerbaijan.

Boyer (January 5, 1924 ‚Äì February 14, 2013)RIP Glenn Boyer 2013-02-19 was a controversial author who published three books and a number of articles about Wyatt Earp and related figures in the American Old West. He was the first person to reveal the existence of Wyatt Earp's second wife, Mattie Blaylock. His publications were for many years regarded as the authoritative source on Wyatt Earp's life. However, when other experts began to seek evidence supporting Boyer's work, he would or could not prove the existence of documents that he said he owned and had cited as essential sources. In one case, an individual he cited as a key source was exposed as a complete fabrication. His reputation and the authenticity of his work was seriously damaged. Although he retained many supporters, his work became surrounded by controversy. At least one critic wrote that all of Boyer's later work was \\"riddled with bogus material\\". One of his books, I Married Wyatt Earp, sold more than 35,000 copies and was the second-best selling book about Wyatt Earp. After many disagreements with University of Arizona press, who initially published the book, Boyer regained rights to the book and had it published by Longmeadow Press as a non-fiction autobiography. Boyer published over more than 30 years a number of books and articles. He was responsible for publishing the memoirs of Doc Holliday's common-law wife Big Nose Kate, as well as the long-sought \\"Flood Manuscript\\" which had been written with Wyatt Earp's direct input. Personal life Boyer, a native of Wisconsin, joined the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1943 and served in the U.S. Air Force until his retirement as a Lieutenant Colonel in 1965. During his time in the Air Force he conducted a statistical analysis of F-100 aircraft to help determine the cause of a high accident rate; the analysis found that the planes were being overused and recommended more downtime. In September, 1897 Wyatt Earp and partner Charles E. Hoxie built the Dexter Saloon in Nome, Alaska. Boyer's father operated a shovel and rocker and also worked in the Dexter Saloon as a janitor in 1901, when he met Wyatt's good friend, George Miller. Boyer's father and George Miller's son Bill developed a friendship, and Bill married Estelle Edwards in Rice County, Kansas in 1877. Estelle was Wyatt Earp's niece and the daughter of Adelia Earp Edwards. Boyer reunited with the Miller family after they retired to San Bernardino, when he was in the military and stationed near them. Boyer says during the time he spent with the Miller family he gathered a lot of information on the Earp family. \\"They became a second set of parents to me.\\" Boyer married author Jane Candia Coleman in 1980. He died on February 14, 2013, at age 89, in Tucson, Arizona. He was survived by his wife Jane, two sons and three grandchildren.  Boyer collection  During his later years as an officer in the USAF, Boyer spent much of his personal time meeting with and interviewing surviving members of the Earp family. He interviewed a number of Wyatt‚Äôs relations including the Cason family, who had known Wyatt's common-law wife Josephine Earp as \\"Aunt Josie\\" in the 1930s. While serving in the U.S. Air Force in Ajo, Arizona, he met Albert Price Behan, Johnny Behan's son. Boyer accumulated 32 boxes of correspondence with the Earp family, family pictures, hand-written notes, audio recordings, weapons, and memorabilia, along with manuscripts that he used as source material for several books, including the memoir I Married Wyatt Earp, supposedly written by Wyatt Earp's wife, Josephine Earp. Along with hundreds of letters and personal writings, the Earp family also gave Boyer \\"trunks full of personal items\\" and several firearms belonging to the Earp brothers and their father. On April 17, 2014, Glenn Boyer's family put much of his Earp collection and many artifacts up for auction. Among the 32 boxes of documentation, files, pictures and memorabilia for sale was a Colt .45 caliber said by Earp descendants to have been owned by Wyatt Earp. Also included in the auction was a Winchester lever-action shotgun belonging to Wyatt Earp. The Wyatt revolver from Boyer's estate was expected to fetch from $100,000 to $150,000. On the day of the auction, more than 6,400 online bidders and over 400 collectors from 49 countries took part in the auction. The revolver attributed to Wyatt Earp was sold to an unnamed phone bidder from New Mexico for $225,000. The Winchester lever-action shotgun also said to be Wyatt Earp's sold for $50,000, below the high value estimate of $125,000. In 2009, Boyer arranged with Legendary Publishing of Edmond, Oklahoma, the publishers of what would be his final book, Where the Heart Was, to have his VHS tapes converted to DVDs, and to have his research scanned and digitized, but no publication date was announced. = Cason manuscript = The facts about when Josephine Earp first arrived in the Arizona Territory, her life before and while living in Tombstone, and when she first began a relationship with Earp, have been obscured by her legal and personal efforts to keep that period private. After Earp's death, Josephine collaborated with two of her husband's cousins, Mabel Earp Cason and her sister Vinolia Earp Ackerman, to document her life. The cousins recorded events in her later life, but they found Josephine was extremely evasive. In her conversations with the Earp cousins, Josephine was imprecise about the timing and nature of events during her early life in the Arizona Territory and Tombstone. Josephine apparently wanted to keep her and Wyatt's tarnished history during the Tombstone period private and to sanitize their life story of anything that could be seen negatively. Wyatt's cousins pressed her for details about her personal life in Tombstone. She finally volunteered that she had returned to the Arizona Territory in 1881 and joined Johnny Behan in Tombstone because he had promised to marry her. She was disappointed and disillusioned when he repeatedly delayed the wedding. She was ready to leave him, but Behan persuaded her to remain. In her version of events, she said years later that she lived with a lawyer while working as a housekeeper for Behan and his ten-year-old son, Albert. Boyer argued that she actually lived with Behan. Boyer warns readers of \\"her ‚Äòlittle-old-lady‚Äô attempts to tell only the decorous and proper.\\" Along with her own past, Josephine was sensitive about what others might think if they learned about Wyatt's common-law wife, Mattie Blaylock. Blaylock suffered from severe headaches and was addicted to laudanum, an opiate-based pain reliever in common use at the time. After the Earp Vendetta Ride, she joined the rest of the Earp family in Colton, California where she expected Earp to call for her. When Wyatt failed to contact her, she returned to prostitution and later committed suicide. Wyatt may have still been living with Blaylock when Josephine and Wyatt began their relationship. Cason says she and her sister \\"finally abandoned work on the manuscript because she [Josie] would not clear up the Tombstone sequence where it pertained to her and Wyatt.\\" Other writers and researchers reported that Josephine was often \\"difficult\\" to interview. After the publication of Boyer's book, An Illustrated Life of Doc Holliday in 1966, Wyatt Earp's grandniece Estelle Josephine Miller and her husband Bill Miller contacted Boyer. They were looking for a writer to write a book with a more balanced story about their uncle. Estelle Miller remembered Earp well. She said he \\"wasn't like them writers say.\\" She insisted he was neither a Boy Scout nor a saint, but a \\"rough, tough, profane, rooting-tooting frontiersman.\\" Seeking more information, Boyer contacted Virgil Earp's granddaughter Mable Earp Cason only to learn she had died. Her daughter Jeanne Cason Laing cooperated with Boyer and sent Boyer a stack of material \\"almost a foot high\\", the result of three attempts by her mother and aunt to write a biography of Josephine Earp. This included material from the 1930s that Jeanne called the \\"Cason manuscript.\\" Boyer interviewed her and other family members, gleaning details of Josephine's life, and received additional documents and photographs. = Clum manuscript = In addition to the Cason manuscript Josephine prepared with the help of the Earp cousins, Boyer claimed to possess the so-called Clum manuscript. He said it contained details of Wyatt and Josephine's life in Tombstone that were missing from the story she wrote with the Earp cousins. Boyer said that the Clum manuscript had been written by The Tombstone Epitaph publisher John Clum based on conversations with Josephine. Boyer wrote in the epilogue to the 1976 edition of his book I Married Wyatt Earp, \\"The first Josephine Earp manuscript, the one prepared with the assistance of Parsons and Clum, had been made available to me earlier by Mrs. Charles [Esther] Colyn, an Earp researcher, collector and genealogist of the first magnitude. Upon her death in 1973, this Earp relative by marriage bequeathed me her whole research collection to perpetuate. Without her generous assistance over the years, I would not have attempted to construct this book. The Cason manuscript alone simply lacked the necessary detail on Tombstone; it was essential to couple it with the earlier, more frank manuscript, before a complete narrative could be achieved.\\" Esther Colyn wrote Glenn Boyer on December 9, 1965, as reprinted in The Suppressed Murder of Wyatt Earp published in 1976‚Ä¶ \\"I never had a real manuscript which could be called such.\\" A year after I Married Wyatt Earp was published in 1977, Boyer published a pamphlet, Trailing an American Myth, in which he stated that the Clum manuscript was actually written by several authors. He wrote that their work formed \\"the basis of the Tombstone years in I Married Wyatt Earp and \\"the Ten Eyck Papers in Wyatt Earp's Tombstone Vendetta.\\" Also in 1977, Boyer wrote and published another pamphlet, \\"Who Killed John Ringo?\\" It stated that fiction writers Dashiell Hammett, Wilson Mizner, Rex Beach and Walt Coburn had written a portion of the manuscript documenting Josephine' Tombstone years. When questioned about the origins of the Clum manuscript during the early 1980s, Boyer changed his story to say that he did not receive the Clum manuscript from Colyn after all, instead it was given to him by one of Earp's nieces, Jeanne Cason Laing. When asked if these were all the same manuscript, Boyer replied, \\"Some of them are a manuscript. Some are only a mishmash, as a matter of fact... The earlier ones of those guys all lean heavily on Clum and Parsons for insights, which is one of the reasons they got in trouble with Josephine Earp... This is a broad way when I say I refer to a Clum manuscript, for example. It is a broad way of referring to something when really this is nobody's business in a way.\\" He said the documents contributed \\"to the overall fabric of Josie's story were undoubtedly made by former Tombstone mayor and Earp friend John Clum,\\" but that \\"some Earp researchers got hung up on this 'manuscript' business.\\" Boyer said that the Clum manuscript could be found in the University of Arizona archives but they could not produce it. Boyer finally admitted that he no longer had the Clum manuscript and could not locate it. When asked by a reporter in 1998 if the Clum manuscript was real, Boyer replied, \\"Why am I compelled to tell the truth about a manuscript like that that is worth a lot of money?\\" Boyer continues. \\"I may have it and I may not. That's none of your business.\\" When asked if the Clum manuscript was a compilation of sources, he said, \\"You bet your ass.\\" \\"The Clum manuscript is a generic term and I've said it over and over.\\" Student-reporter Ryan Gabrielson from the University of Arizona Wildcat interviewed Boyer. He told Gabrielson, \\"The Clum manuscript is a generic term.\\" \\"This‚Äîin addition (to other source materials)‚Äîwas supported by literally hundreds, maybe thousands of letters and documents.\\" Reporter Tony Ortega concluded that Boyer's varied descriptions of the manuscript, its origins, and its eventual disposition are \\"so contradictory that they aren't credible.\\"  Publications  Boyer began researching Wyatt Earp after retiring from the Air Force in 1965. He developed a relationship with Jeanne Cason Laing, the granddaughter of Virgil Earp. She supplied him with source material for a considerable portion of what he wrote. His research resulted in three primary books: The Suppressed Murder of Wyatt Earp, Wyatt Earp's Tombstone Vendetta, and I Married Wyatt Earp, and many other articles. His Earp publications came under increased scrutiny and criticism during after 1990, and he was the focus of considerable controversy. Jeff Morey, one of the most respected Earp researcher and writer, was the first to publicly question Boyer's credibility. In 1994, he wrote an essay titled \\"The Curious Vendetta of Glenn G. Boyer\\" published by the Western Outlaw-Lawman History Association. In 1998, three more articles were published that completely undermined his credibility. The first was an article by Gary L. Roberts \\"Trailing an American Mythmaker: History and Glenn G. Boyer‚Äôs Tombstone Vendetta,\\" published by the same association. This was followed by two articles written by Tony Ortega of the Phoenix New Times: \\"How the West was Spun\\" in December 1998 and \\"I Varied Wyatt Earp\\" in March 1999. Allen Barra, author of Inventing Wyatt Earp, wrote that after Boyer's book The Suppressed Murder of Wyatt Earp, all of his later work was \\"riddled with bogus material.\\" = Life of Doc Holliday = One of Boyer's first books, The Illustrated Life of Doc Holliday, was initially published in 1966 as a \\"crime novel.\\" When a reader many years later questioned him about the truthfulness of the work, Boyer told her that it was a hoax and a satire he wrote to purposefully trap careless researchers. Boyer included pictures of Old Western individuals that turned out to be images of his family. Boyer wrote, \\"It had no other purpose but to set afoot an experiment that would expose these people conclusively for the type of hypocritical goddam history-faking they were doing. And it worked.\\" = Suppressed Murder of Wyatt Earp = This book, which Boyer wrote to describe how other writers had ‚Äúmurdered‚Äù the factual details of Wyatt‚Äôs life and personality, was widely admired for the apparent volume of research. In the book, he revealed for first time the existence of Wyatt Earp's second wife, Mattie Blaylock, and her suicide, along with information that supported Frank Waters' view that Wyatt had abandoned her. He also portrayed Wyatt Earp in a positive light without succumbing to hero worship. = I Married Wyatt Earp = Cover of the University of Arizona Press edition The University of Arizona Press first published the book in 1976 under the title I Married Wyatt Earp: The Recollections of Josephine Sarah Marcus. The copyright was issued in her name and her name was given as the author. A book published by a university press must be non-fiction. When it is sold as non-fiction, academics and knowledgeable non-academics consider the university's approval sacrosanct. He became recognized as an expert on Wyatt Earp, Boyer's book gained wide acceptance as a memoir written by Josephine and an accurate portrayal of her life with Wyatt Earp. The book was immensely popular for many years, capturing the imagination of people with an interest in western history, studied in classrooms, cited by scholars, and relied upon as factual by filmmakers. It became the university's fourth all-time best-selling book with 12 printings totaling more than 35,000 copies. Boyer in turn received wide recognition as the foremost authority on Wyatt Earp. Boyer was asked to produce a copy of a key source document, the so-called \\"Clum manuscript\\", but he replied that the document had been lost and found and lost again. He concluded: \\"It is alive and well. In my head.\\" He blamed the University of Arizona for his having invented the Clum manuscript. \\"They forced me to go back to something a little more nebulous in order to get published. I have never promoted myself as a historian. So I put words in Josephine's mouth. So what? Stuart Lake did it. I admit to making it interesting enough to be read, which it appears to be alleged is unethical.\\" When confronted with allegations that I Married Wyatt Earp was a hoax, Boyer said he had been misunderstood. \\"My work is beginning to be recognized by all but a few fanatics and their puppets as a classic example of the newly recognized genre 'creative non-fiction.'\\" It was described by the Annual Review of Information Science and Technology in 2006 as a \\"creative exercise\\" and hoax. Some rival authors have said that the book cannot be relied on. As a result of the criticism and faults discovered with the book, in early 2000 the University refused to comment about the book and referred all questions to university lawyers. On January 29, 2000, Boyer posted a note on Amazon.com that he intended to take back the rights to the book. In March the University of Arizona Press announced they had released all rights to the book, removed the book from their catalog, and returned unsold copies to Boyer. The university stated that they take their scholarly review process more seriously now than when the book was first published. Boyer claimed he decided to drop publication because he was disappointed with the university's handling of movie rights. Boyer found a small publisher in Hawaii, shortened the title to I Married Wyatt Earp, and shifted authorship to his own name. = Wyatt Earp's Tombstone Vendetta = In an interview with the Phoenix New Times, Bob Palmquist, an attorney and avid Earp researcher, said he worked with Boyer for many years. He said that he read a portion of Boyer's manuscript for Wyatt Earp's Tombstone Vendetta in 1977. \\"And at that time he [Boyer] was saying it was a novel in the style of George McDonald Frasers The Flashman Papers.\\" \\"The idea was to write a novel in the style of a memoir as if somebody was actually telling the story, in this case Ted Ten Eyck,\\" Palmquist says. In a 1977 letter to Earp researcher Robert Mullin, Boyer told a very different story about Ten Eyck. Boyer wrote that he had received a new manuscript from Earp family members, \\"allegedly by one Teodore [sic] Ten Eyck, a name I can find nowhere else in Earpiana.\\" Boyer claimed that the manuscript was \\"clearly authentic\\" and that it contained \\"fascinating revelations (if they are true) and would make an ace movie.\\" In the foreword to the book, Boyer wrote that his book is written in the form of a \\"non-fiction novel\\", and that he had invented a character named name Ten Eyck to protect the newsman's family, who asked that he not be named. In an interview with Wild West Magazine, Boyer defended his use of a invented character in the book. \\"I was more than slightly amused that some in the Earp field were shocked and aghast that I used a literary device to tell the story.\\" \\"Your average high school kid could figure out that the character (Ten Eyck) was a storytelling device. Even the most howling of my critics would grant that I am not stupid. Ergo, it stands to reason that if I used a figure that was not historically present in Tombstone during that period, something less than a genius could pick up on that‚Äîor so I thought.\\" As critics grew more specific in their questions and challenged his work, Boyer's description of Ten Eyck varied widely. He called the book a memoirs of a journalist, Ted Ten Eyck, who was present in Tombstone while the Earps were lawmen. In the book, Ten Eyck worked for the New York Herald in 1881, but his name is not found in any of the paper's 1881-82 editions. While positioned by Boyer as a non-fiction novel, it contains errors that cannot be resolved if the author is a real person. In the book, Ten Eyck identified Budd Philpot's hometown as \\"Halistoga\\", which Boyer identified as a misprint. In a footnote, he noted that the town's actual name was \\"Calistoga\\". In a story about Philpot published in The Tombstone Epitaph, Philpot's home is \\"Calistoga\\", although the 'C' is very faint. In 1951, Douglas Martin reprinted editions of the newspaper from that period, in which the indistinct 'C' is turned into 'H'. Boyer said Ten Eyck died in 1946, causing researchers to wonder how he could replicate this error before it had been made. One critic described Wyatt Earp's Tombstone Vendetta, as \\"a book so bizarre it stands as emblematic of all that is troublesome in Earp literature.\\" The doubts raised by Wyatt Earp's Tombstone Vendetta seriously damaged his credibility. Jeanne Cason Laing, the woman who, years earlier, had given Boyer the Cason manuscript, was troubled by assertions that Ten Eyck was with Josephine when she died. She says Boyer tried to convince her that Ten Eyck was real and that Laing had known him. \\"Vendetta is full of lies. It's not like [Josephine] at all,\\" she says. = Later publications = During the 1980s, he published several more novels, including, Winchester Affidavit set in New Mexico that fictionalized late 19th-century events there. Boyer also published several articles in Arizona Highways. During the 1990s Boyer wrote the Morgette fictional series based around a man named Dorn set in the Old West. He also published a fictional book ‚ÄúCuster, Terry and Me.‚Äù about Gen. George Armstrong Custer. His last book, in 2009 Where the Heart Was, was a fictional semi- autobiography loosely based on his own family and childhood growing up rural Wisconsin.  Support and criticism  Boyer inspired both extremely loyal supporters and a number of critics. Ben Traywick, author of Chronicles of Tombstone, John Henry‚ÄîThe Doc Holliday Story, and other works, and formerly Tombstone, Arizona's official volunteer Town Historian, said ‚ÄúBoyer was a giant in the field of Earp history, nobody could touch him.‚Äù He was described by others as \\"opinionated, cantankerous, interesting and funny as hell.\\" Boyer was very choosy about who he allowed to view his library and files, occasionally providing authors like Ben Traywick and Lee Silva with access. He also invited Scott Dyke, a retired Wall Street broker, businessman, banker, and researcher who moved to southern Arizona, to help organize his materials. Dyke spent nine years and thousands of hours collating and organizing Boyer's files. He said Boyer's \\"collection of files, pictures and tapes, both audio and visual, is staggering in volume.\\" Boyer collected a large portion of his documentation from Earp family members, many of whom he personally knew. Dyke said the records documented Boyer's ongoing contact with Earp relatives and genealogists for more than 60 years. Among his files was a mass of papers given to Boyer by Esther Colyn, a genealogist who had researched the Earp family. The records included the recollections of the Miller family who also gave Boyer a number of Wyatt's personal effects. Dyke said that Boyer gave him permission to view both the Flood manuscript, dictated by Wyatt Earp, and Josie's story as told to the Earp cousins, known as the Cason manuscript. Dyke learned that Boyer had gained an oral history from Earp relatives who had known Wyatt, which Boyer relied in part for some of his work. But Boyer limited what Dyke could say about the collection, and Dyke said that Boyer told him that parts of his collection \\"grew legs and took a hike.\\" Although Dyke is more familiar with Boyer's archive than anyone, he wouldn't characterize Boyer's books as accurate, factual accounts of Earp's life. \\"Maybe he wrote his opinion in his books and stretched reality, but he didn't make up the research.\\" Boyer donated copies of the Flood and Cason manuscripts and other documents to the Ford County Historical Society, including an original journal kept by Josephine Earp, Wyatt's wife, with the condition that he would approve who could see the documents. = Refuses access to critics = In the 1990s, other authors and academics began to ask questions about his sources. Despite the wealth of information contained in his archives, Boyer uniformly declined to allow critics access to his repository. He promised Gary Roberts and Casey Tefertiller, two vocal critics of Boyer's work, access to his archives, but when they visited him in person, he reneged on his agreement. = Condemns critics = Boyer was often contemptuous of his critics, calling them \\"homosexuals\\", \\"fanatics and their puppets\\", among other things. He teased that he wouldn't reveal his sources just because he didn't like the individuals who questioned his truthfulness. \\"I am sorry that I ever wrote a fucking word about Wyatt Earp,\\" he told a reporter. \\"I will never do such a goddam [sic] act of generosity for the public again. They killed the goose that laid the golden egg.\\" \\"I do not have to give a shit about young historians, middle-aged historians, old historians, dead historians or historians who are not yet born,\\" says Boyer. \\"This is my fucking perspective. I happen to be a literary artist performing.\\" When author Ann Kirschner, Dean of William E. Macaulay Honors College of The City University of New York, decided to write a book about Josephine Earp, she paid a visit to Boyer. She wrote that she had hundreds of stories about Boyer. \\"He was a hero, a villain, a thief, a scholar, a scamp. Or maybe all of the above.\\" She met with him about a dozen times over three years. In their first interview, he wanted to know if she was \\"one of those 'libbers'\\", which he defined as \\"A woman seeking on a public platform the sexual satisfaction that has eluded her everywhere else.\\" He wondered aloud to her about ‚Äúwhy so many apparent homosexuals were drawn to Wyatt Earp...I wondered if they deplored their own place in society and in fact their biological propensity and were seeking an ultra male identity with Wyatt Earp.\\" She remembers him stating that the group ‚ÄúFriends of Tombstone‚Äù should be renamed ‚ÄúFaggots on Tour.‚Äù = Effect on research = Jack Burrows, who wrote John Ringo, The Gunfighter Who Never Was, said, ‚ÄúHow can he just take a stack of material and give it a name that has nothing to do with what‚Äôs included? You can take a cowpie and call it filet mignon, but somebody‚Äôs going to catch on during dinner. This is just gobbledygook.‚Äù Gary Roberts, Professor Emeritus of History of Abraham Baldwin College in Tifton, Georgia, and the author of seventy-five articles on Western history, said, \\"By passing off his opinions and interpretations as primary sources, he has poisoned the record in a way that may take decades to clear.\\" He said that Boyer's work \\"poisons the debate about Wyatt Earp, and until Boyer's sources can be authenticated, the interpretations based on them cannot even be addressed.\\" Roberts commented, \\"The tragedy is that even if [Glenn Boyer] has found the truth, it is so buried in a crazy quilt of obfuscation and deceit that serious researchers will not believe it... He has succeeded in becoming a part of the Earp saga that cannot be ignored. But at what cost to history?\\"  Estate sale  On April 17, 2014, Boyer's family put much of his Earp collection and many artifacts up for auction. Among the 32 boxes of documentation, files, pictures and memorabilia for sale were three pistols and a Winchester lever-action shotgun. One of the pistols is a Colt revolver once owned by Virgil Earp, a Remington Ball and Cap Revolver owned by Earp's grandfather, and a Colt .45-caliber Earp descendants said had been owned by Wyatt Earp. The shotgun was also reported to be Wyatt Earp's. Personal items of Josephine Earp's in the auction include her riding crop, opera glasses and jewelry. The history of the items is controversial because they belonged to Boyer. John Boessenecker, an author of numerous articles on the American Old West and a collector of American Old West guns and memorabilia, said that it would be \\"impossible to separate the authenticity of the auction items from Boyer's own troubled history.\\" This is particularly true because the provenance of the weapons is based on letters written by or given to Boyer. Bill Miller, a nephew by marriage to Wyatt Earp, wrote in a letter to Boyer that he received two of the pistols and the shotgun from Allie Earp, Virgil's wife. Casey Tefertiller, a long-time critic of Boyer's work, commented on the auction. \\"How do you trust material you're buying from somebody caught fabricating evidence? He was the most charismatic, charming person I have ever met. But people wound up paying for it by buying into a hoax.\\" The revolver, said to have been carried by Wyatt Earp in Tombstone, has had the grips, barrel, and cylinder replaced. Only the frame is original, and it is missing a serial number. But X-ray testing revealed an original serial number that matched records confirming Earp had owned the gun. Before his death, Boyer completed a sworn affidavit attesting that the Colt .45 belonged to Earp. The affidavit is included with the revolver along with other expert findings. LeRoy Merz is the owner of Merz Antique Firearms, the nation's largest dealer in antique Winchesters in the United States. Despite Boyer's affidavit, he said the missing serial number is a \\"kiss of death,\\" he says. \\"No serious collector will want that.\\" Prior to the auction, the Wyatt revolver was expected to fetch from $100,000 and $150,000. On the day of the auction, more than 6,400 online bidders and over 400 collectors from 49 countries took part in the auction. The revolver attributed to Wyatt Earp was sold to an unnamed phone bidder from New Mexico for $225,000. The Winchester lever-action shotgun also said to be Wyatt Earp's sold for $50,000, below the high value estimate of $125,000, and the Colt revolver that belonged to Virgil Earp sold for $37,500. John Anderson, a local businessman, was the winning bidder at $160,000 of the pistol owned by Virgil and his grandfather, the shotgun owned by Wyatt, and the 32 boxes of historical research. He refused to bid on the Colt that was reported to belong to Wyatt Earp. ‚ÄúWas it the one from the O.K. Corral? I don‚Äôt believe it was ‚Ä¶,‚Äù he said. Anderson said he is looking for an accredited museum to house the weapons, and that he would donate the research to the University of Arizona. Boyer's widow, Jane Coleman, said, \\"Glenn would hate that.\\"  Published works  (non-fiction) (non-fiction) (historical fiction) (fiction) (fiction) (fiction) (fiction) (fiction) (fiction) (non-fiction) (historical fiction) (non-fiction) (fiction) (fiction) (fiction) (fiction) (semi-autobiography)  References  1924 births 2013 deaths 20th-century American novelists 20th-century American male writers American historical novelists American male novelists Novelists from Arizona Novelists from Wisconsin American frontier ","title":"Glenn Boyer"},{"id":"38578139","text":"Ostoja Jan z Jani (Joannes de Janie in Medieval Latin,Note that Jan z Jani was originally of Dutch ethnic origins and this form of the name is a Medieval/Renaissance-era Latinized form of a Dutch name altered by the macaronic influence of vernacular French, then the lingua franca throughout Europe.

Its name is due to its appearance, as breeding males have a blue head. Adult bluehead chubs are, on average, between 70 and 160 mm in length. They have a robust body with uniformly large scales. The scales are present on the belly and breast. They have a pored body, a weakly falcate pectoral fin, and pharyngeal teeth. They have a large mouth, small eyes, and a terminal barbel. Other characteristics include a darkened lateral band, spot on the caudal fin, and red coloration of the fins and iris of the eyes. They have 40 lateral line scales and 8 anal rays. The bluehead chub is a freshwater fish, and lives in pools, rivers, and streams. They feed on insects and plants.  Habitat  Bluehead chubs inhabit freshwater pools, creeks, and small to medium rivers with sandy or rocky bottoms. They live in warm to cool waters that have swift currents and are usually turbid.  Reproduction and life cycle  Bluehead chubs spawn in the spring and reproduce by external fertilization in which the female releases eggs onto the bottom and the male releases sperm to fertilize the eggs. The male makes a nest of gravel in a mound for the female to deposit the eggs. After fertilization, the male guards the eggs until they hatch. They mature for three years before reaching reproductive maturity. Distribution The bluehead chub is native to the United States and can be found in the southeastern United States. It is distributed throughout the York River system of Virginia, the Atlantic and Gulf coast drainage, and the lower Mississippi River drainage into Mississippi and Louisiana. Its range includes Virginia, West Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, Florida and Louisiana. As a result of bait bucket releases by fishermen, the bluehead chub has spread to multiple drainage basins in which it is not native.

In the late 1950s, at the beginning of the Space Race, Cushman had been an editor at Aviation Week & Space Technology. From 1962 to the late-1980s, he was an editor for Electronic Design News. He started out at EDN as the East Coast editor and soon rose to Special Features Editor covering microprocessing. Cushman was widely known within the microprocessing industry for his influential writings in Electronic Design News about microprocessors during its infancy in the early 1970s, through its period of rapid growth and development in the 1980s. His articles, collectively, chronicle the birth and early milestones of microprocessors and, at the time, helped bridge technical development with applications. Citations of his work are prevalent in documents produced by academicians, engineers, the military, and NASA. At the time of Cushman's death, he and his wife were residents of Old Lyme, Connecticut. Before retiring, he and his wife had been a long-time residents of Port Washington, New York.  Early career  Cushman earned a high school diploma in 1942 from the Professional Children's School in Manhattan. After the start of World War II, he entered the U.S. Navy as a Lt. J.G.. Upon earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, he served in China. After the war, Cushman, an avid sailor, spent two years as a yacht designer with Philip L. Rhodes, who later designed the Weatherly. In 1959, after serving as Associate Editor of Automatic Control, Cushman accepted a position as Public Relations Director of Daystrom, Inc., San Diego, which was acquired by Schlumberger in 1962, but continued to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary. Cushman had retired as Senior Editor at Cahners Publishing, a longtime division of Reed Elsevier and, at the time, parent of EDN.  Growing up  Cushman had been a child actor. At the age of ‚Äî from January 21, 1939, to June 1, 1939, and from July 17, 1939, to September 23, 1939 ‚Äî Cushman had acted in the Broadway play, The American Way, in the role of Young Alex Hewitt at that RKO Roxy Theatre. The play ran for 244 performances.

; Notable ancestry Cushman, by way of his father, Clifford Howell Cushman (1891‚Äì1974), was a tenth-generation lineal descendant of Thomas Cushman (1608‚Äì1691) and wife, Mary Allerton (1616‚Äì1699) ‚Äî settlers of the Plymouth Colony. The lineage is all paternal, hence the same surname. Mary Allerton was a passenger on the Mayflower, the first ship to arrive in Plymouth in 1620. Thomas Cushman was a passenger on the Fortune, the second ship to arrive in 1621. Cushman was also an eleventh generation lineal descendant of Francis Eaton, also a passenger on the Mayflower and settler of Plymouth ‚Äî a fourth generation female descendant of Francis Eaton married a third generation descendant of Robert and Mary Cushman. Nowadays, tens of millions of Americans have at least one ancestor from the Plymouth Colony, many of whom affiliated with the Mayflower Society. But, according to Galton- Watson probability, only a fraction of that number have an unbroken chain of paternal lineage maintaining the same surname. ; Family Cushman married Rose Katherine Clausing October 4, 1952, in Butler County, Ohio. They had a daughter and a son and remained married years, until his death.

Miss in Her Teens; or The Medley of Lovers is a farce (or afterpiece) written in 1747 by David Garrick. It was adapted from Florent Carton Dancourt's 1691 play La Parisienne. It was the third play written by Garrick, and was first performed on 17 January 1747 at Covent Garden. The play concerns a young woman, Miss Biddy, and her various suitors. Mary Delany saw Miss in Her Teens in 1747 and remarked of the play in correspondence that \\"nothing can be lower\\". Of Garrick's performance she remarked that \\"...the part he acts in himself (Mr. Fribble) he makes so ridiculous that it is very entertaining\\" and added that \\"It is said that he mimics eleven men of fashion\\". A 1798 performance was attended by George III and the British royal family.

The matter related to intent and mens rea and the role of strict liability offences. Background He Kaw Teh, the accused, was convicted of two offences under section 233B(1)(b) and (c) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) . by possessing and importing 2.78kg of heroin. At trial the court found that offences under these provisions were strict liability offences. The defendant maintained that he was unaware that he had the heroin in his possession (i.e. it was ‚Äòplanted‚Äô) and hence he should not be liable. He was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Finding He Kaw Teh appealed his conviction to the High Court of Australia, who found for the appellant. The court found, taking precedent from Sherras v De Rutzen (1895),Sherras v De Rutzen [1895] 1 918 at 921. that the prosecution needed to establish an intent in matters of significant criminality unless the presumption was rebutted. Gibbs CJ found that ‚Äúit is unlikely that the Parliament intended the consequences of committing an offence so serious should be visited on a person who had no intention to do anything wrong and no knowledge that he or she was doing so.‚ÄùHe Kaw Teh v R (1985) 157 CLR 523 at 529-30 per Gibbs CJ. Dawson J found similarly that ‚Äúmistaken belief in facts which are inconsistent with the required intent does not have to be based upon reasonable grounds. Either the accused has a guilty mind or he does not, and if an honest belief, whether reasonable or not, points to the absence of the required intent, then the prosecution fails to prove its case.‚ÄùHe Kaw Teh v R (1985) 157 CLR 523 per Dawson at 7. Brennan J held that where the offence is governed by statute, the requisite level of mens rea is established by interpreting the words of the statute and the intention of the legislation. When the statute is silent about the requisite mens rea, there is a presumption that the highest level of mens rea is required, that being ‚Äòintention‚Äô. However, this presumption can be rebutted through interpretation of the legislation in question in the case.

He is best known for assuming command of Akershus Fortress from the German occupiers at the end of the Second World War. Early life Terje Rollem was born in B√¶rum to a clerk named Theodor Georg Martinsen and his wife Margit Dagny Berner H√∏glund. He grew up with his brothers Egil, Svein Thor, Bj√∏rn and Dag. After taking exams at Holte Gymnasium in Denmark, Rollem entered Stabekk Upper Secondary School with a focus on realfag (emphasis on primarily science and mathematics). He finished the examen artium in 1934, and the next year began his military career at the Officer Candidate School for Kavaleriet (cavalry/dragoon branch of the Norwegian Army, lit. \\"the cavalry\\") located at Gardermoen army base. He attended two more schools in the years following: Wangs Vocational school in 1939 and Oslo Technical school in 1941. Role in the Norwegian resistance Rollem was a second lieutenant conscript in the Norwegian Army when war broke out in Norway. Rollem began driving to the front at Tr√∏ndelag on 11 April 1940, two days after the invasion began. However, a German paratrooper landing at Domb√•s prevented him from reaching the front, so he travelled to Hamar to join up with the 2nd Dragoon Regiment (DR 2). With DR 2 Rollem fought in several battles to prevent the German advance, including in Gudbrandsdalen, and was at √Öndalsnes when the Norwegians surrendered in Southern Norway. After the Norwegians' defence against Germany failed, Rollem returned to finish his degree at Oslo Technical School. In 1941 he was hired at the engineering firm Ingeni√∏r Falkenberg, where he worked until 1944. It was during this period that Rollem became involved with illegal work for the Norwegian resistance organization Milorg, division D 13.233 (Oslo area between Akerselva and Lysakerelva), and in 1944 he began working for the organization full-time. To avoid detection, Rollem moved from his home in Blommenholm to a cabin at Sollih√∏gda, which became his base of operations when he was chosen as the Milorg head of district D 13, comprising the greater Oslo area. Among other activities, Rollem trained volunteers at Katnosa farm, a resistance base on the banks of Katnosa that was 50 soldiers strong. On the night of 8 May 1945, the Milorg men were informed via radio of the German capitulation. Rollem was suddenly responsible for mobilizing his troops to retake buildings all over Oslo. Tensions were high as armed German units still roamed the city streets, and in the first days of Oslo's retaking, six people were killed by uneasy soldiers. alt=Ragtag group of men with guns marching away from a walled fortress =Akershus handover= At 10:15 am on 11 May 1945, Rollem was ordered to retake Akershus Fortress for Norway, and he sent a messenger to inform the Germans of their arrival. Rollem, who was stationed nearby at Tollbugata 11, assembled a force of 100 men who carried many Norwegian flags on their march towards the castle at 1:00 pm. Though Rollem had the full cooperation of the commanding officer, Major Josef Nichterlein, the fortress was still a major stronghold for the Germans, and there were doubts whether they would surrender peacefully. Rollem later said of the incident: The handover occurred at 2:30 pm, on the square in front of the fort kommandant's residence. Rollem had insisted on not having a photographer along, feeling that there was no need for such a photograph and the high- strung German soldiers might mistake the camera snaps for gunfire. However, Rollem's supervisor, platoon leader Viggo Didrichson, sent anyway for photographer Johannes Stage to join them on their march to the castle. alt=Three men standing, two on the left dressed in World War II German officer uniforms and saluting the man on the right The handover was captured in a photograph that was later displayed in homes across Norway as symbol of Norwegian liberation. The photograph was taken by Stage with Didrichson by his side, supervising the handover. Terje Rollem is shown standing at attention as Major Nichterlein gives a grim salute along with his adjutant Captain Hamel. Rollem was dressed in old uniform pants refashioned into knickerbockers, Selbu pattern stockings, and a jacket covered by a Milorg armband, a bandolier, and a belt that held his handgun. This outfit, in stark contrast to the neatly uniformed Germans, was an image that represented for many people the everyman regaining control of his country from German oppression. \\"Luckily Didrichson was more sensible than me,\\" said Rollem in a January 1981 interview with Vi Menn. \\"He realized the importance of photographic documentation. That the transfer was a historic moment did not cross my mind. I was just concerned with my assignment. Today I am very glad the photographer was present.\\" After some words between the two men, with Rollem speaking in broken German, Nichterlein gave one last five-minute speech to the soldiers at the fortress. Along with Captain Hamel, Rollem went around the castle grounds, replacing German guards with his own Milorg men. Two Poles condemned to death were freed, and a Norwegian flag was raised, allegedly the same one that was lowered at the fortress in 1940. Nichterlein and his men were transferred to a prisoner-of-war camp in Skien. =Nichterlein's imprisonment= Josef Nichterlein had been a renowned pianist before his involvement in the war, playing in venues all across Europe, such as in Paris, Madrid, and Royal Albert Hall in London. While imprisoned in Skien he kept in contact with Albert Schweitzer, a personal friend who he had toured with on piano with Schweitzer playing organ. The Norwegian guards were quite fond of Nichterlein and many asked him to sign the famous liberation photograph. Nichterlein agreed, but said of the photo, \\"I hope nobody thinks that I brought my hand up for a Hitler salute in the picture‚Äîbecause that man I have loathed all my life.\\" Nichterlein was sent back to Germany in June 1947:no:Wilhelm Nichterlein, but died only a month later and never saw his wife and children again. Postwar years Rollem continued his military career after the war ended, spending a year at the Norwegian Military Academy in 1946 and the next year becoming a rittmester in Kavaleriet and an office manager for Forsvarsstaben at Akershus Fortress, where he gathered intelligence for the military. At the same time, he also worked as a manager at the Granli logging company in Kongsvinger until 1949. In 1951 he began studies at the Royal Swedish Army Staff College in Stockholm. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1956 and served as a chief of staff for Kavaleriet's ordnance personnel. In 1960 he once again attended military school, this time at the Military University College (), and in 1962 he was promoted to oberst and commander for NATO's Allied Forces Northern Europe in Kols√•s. From 1971 until his retirement in 1980 Rollem was head of the Directorate of Public Roads' military branch. Terje Rollem was married to Ellen Marie (‚ÄúNusse‚Äù) Hansen (18.10.1919‚Äì5.11.1995) on 9 June 1944, the same year he adopted Rollem as his surname and dropped his middle name. They were divorced in 1978, after which Rollem lived with his partner Liv Sjetne. After his retirement in 1980, Rollem lived in Lillehammer and maintained his keen interest in the military. He died on 4 April 1993, outlived by his partner Sjetne, and was buried in Lillehammer. In 1995, on the 50th anniversary of Norway's liberation, a postage stamp was issued in Rollem's honor. Rollem was a recipient of the Defence Medal 1940‚Äì1945 with a rosette to indicate his further role in the Norwegian resistance after the initial fight against Germany.

The first two cases were identified on 20 May 1964; eventually over 400 cases were diagnosed and the patients were quarantined at the City Hospital in Urquhart Road, Woodend Hospital in Eday Road, and Tor-na-Dee Hospital in Milltimber which was used as an overflow hospital for typhoid cases. There were three deaths connected with the outbreak. Dr Ian MacQueen, the Medical Officer of Health for Aberdeen, became well known in the media for his twice- daily briefings. The outbreak was eventually traced to contaminated tinned corned beef from Rosario, Argentina and sold in the city's branch of the Scottish grocery chain William Low. Pollution from the waters of the Uruguay River (which flows into the R√≠o de la Plata) appeared to be the source of the contamination, probably through water entering a defective tin through a small puncture. The infected meat then contaminated a meat slicing machine within the William Low shop, leading to the spread of the disease. The bacteria multiplied further in the meats as they were placed near a window and exposed to sunlight. Aftermath The reputation of Aberdeen as a safe city to visit, live and work in was briefly harmed by the media coverage of the outbreak. In July 1964, following the end of the outbreak, The Queen made a high-profile visit to boost morale and to help rehabilitate the city's reputation. An official enquiry and report into the outbreak was commissioned by the Secretary of State for Scotland. The enquiry was headed by Sir David Milne and his published findings became known as the Milne Report. The reputation of William Low was irrevocably damaged within Aberdeen and the city's store, the source of the outbreak, closed for good three years later. Dundee-based company William Low subsequently opened many other stores around Scotland, but remained absent from Aberdeen. William Low was eventually taken over by Tesco in 1994. Public perceptions of the safety of Fray Bentos tinned meats also contributed to significantly diminished income. The outbreak was successfully handled, although there were three fatalities confirmed. The outbreak drew attention to the need for better standards of hygiene, notably in the cleaning of food processing machinery. The University of Aberdeen went on to develop an international reputation in the field of disease control, notably in the appointment of Professor Hugh Pennington to the post of Professor of Bacteriology from 1979 until his retirement in 2003. The typhoid outbreak may have encouraged replacement of traditional laundered roller towels in public toilets, which allowed bacterial cross-infection from person-to-person, by disposable paper towels and warm air hand driers.

Most cattle remain outdoors for most of the year but wintering barns are sometimes used for dairy cows. Animal welfare in New Zealand is governed by the Animal Welfare Act 1999 and a number of organisations actively advocate for both animal welfare and animal rights. Pest control and farming practices have been scrutinised with respect to animal welfare issues. The legality of killing dogs and cats for consumption has also been criticized. Animal welfare issues The New Zealand economy relies heavily on agriculture and many animal welfare issues involve the farming sector. Despite claims that New Zealand has high animal welfare standards, a 2016 report from the National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee, reviewing the use of farrowing crates on pig farms, found that the pork industry does not accept its requirements under the Pigs Codes of Welfare (2010), and that failure by industry to act in accordance with the Pigs Codes of Welfare (2010) is commonplace.https://www.mpi.govt.nz/document- vault/11959 Additionally, the Pigs Codes of Welfare (2010) contradicts animals rights to express normal patterns of behavior as outlined in the Animal Welfare Act 1999.|url= https://www.mpi.govt.nz/document-vault/11959 There were animal welfare concerns on the controversial CraFarms and in June 2011 five people involved with Crafers Taharua Dairy Farm pleaded not guilty to 714 charges of alleged animal welfare offences. In 2013 a farmer was convicted of animal welfare offences after breaking or injuring the tails of 230 cows and he was banned from owning cows. The case was the worst of its type that had been seen by the authorities. A resource consent application under the Resource Management Act 1991 for the intensive farming of cattle in the Mackenzie Basin in 2009 attracted opposition because of concerns over animal welfare, even though animal welfare is not a part of the RMA. The application was \\"called in\\" under provisions of the RMA. The usage of 1080 in New Zealand (a pest control and animal health measure) attracts some opposition on animal welfare grounds but a 2007 assessment of 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate) concluded that the benefits outweighed the risks. In 2010 Landcare Research New Zealand Limited prepared a paper for MAF Biosecurity New Zealand called \\"How humane are our pest control tools?\\".https://www.mpi.govt.nz/document-vault/4009 Various vertebrate toxic agents such as 1080, Brodifacoum, Cholecalciferol and so on, kill traps in mammal species, in-burrow rabbit control methods and leg hold traps, rotenone, alphachloralose and DRC-1339 looked at the ‚Äòanimal welfare impact‚Äô (humanness) of these control tools. The paper describes in detail how various toxins affect different animals. Information on level of consciousness at various times/events after dosing are still needed to fully assess its negative experiences and humanness. =Animal research= Animal research is regulated by the Animal Welfare Act 1999 and organisations using animals must follow an approved code of ethical conduct. This sets out the policies and procedures that need to be adopted and followed by the organisation and its animal ethics committee (AEC). Every project must be approved and monitored by an AEC which includes lay members. = Companion animals = In 2009, a Tongan man living in New Zealand cooked his dog in his back yard, which prompted calls to ban the practice, but this did not happen. = Wildlife smuggling = New Zealand has a number of rare and endangered species and there have been cases of wildlife smuggling. The Wildlife Enforcement Group, a group of three government departments, collectively investigate smuggling to and from New Zealand. The three agencies are the New Zealand Customs Service, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Department of Conservation.Multi-agency effort to catch wildlife criminals New Zealand is a signatory to CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) which was set up to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. CITES is administered by the Department of Conservation. Organisations A number of organisations in New Zealand actively pursue animal welfare issues. The Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RNZSPCA or more commonly, SPCA), the longest established animal welfare organisation in New Zealand, was formed in Dunedin in 1882 and was inspired by the English Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. SAFE (Save Animals From Exploitation) is an animal rights advocacy group that has run a number of high-profile campaigns. SAFE ran a campaign against intensive pig farming featuring the comedian Mike King who had previously fronted an advertising campaign that promoted the sale of pork.

The shortline railroad was 29 miles long, running from south of Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania past the town, then northwards to Jamison City, Pennsylvania, with 4.45 miles of yard tracks. The Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad was one of five railroads serving Bloomsburg near the turn of the 20th century. The Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad Company's headquarters was in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, and the managers of the company were James Corcoran and Thomas Wheeler. The Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad owned five locomotives and seven cars in 1917. History In the 1870s and early 1880s, a Bloomsburg newspaper, The Columbian, ran a series of articles promoting a railroad from Bloomsburg to Sullivan County. These articles told of timber, \\"soft coal\\", and \\"iron ore\\" in the area, and stated that communities along the railroad's route would profit greatly from the railroad. However, the idea to build the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad was first conceived by David Jewett Waller. In August 1883, a meeting was hosted in Benton to discuss the railroad, and the charter for the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad was granted in November 1883. The right-of-way for the railroad was secured by H.J. Connor and Silas McHenry. Charles R. Buckalew was made president of the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad starting in 1886. In 1886, tracks were laid near Orangeville, and in 1887, tracks were laid near Bloomsburg. In May 1887, the Columbian started a column entitled \\"Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad Notes\\". The tracks reached Benton in 1887. The railroad was completed in 1888, and service began on November 30 of that year. The railroad was mostly built by fifty Italian workers overseen by John Bush. Approximately 0.75 miles of track were laid each day of construction. In 1889, there were plans to extend the railroad further north to Bernice, Pennsylvania and the Lehigh Valley Railroad, if coal fields were discovered in that area, but this plan was never carried out. However, a route in this area was surveyed. The first freight on the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad was shipped on June 21, 1887, from Bloomsburg to Lightstreet. The first passenger train on the railroad ran in September 1887. By November 1888, lumber was being regularly shipped via the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad from Jamison City to the east coast of the United States. By 1915, six passenger trains and several freight trains were running on the railroad each day, although there was more traffic on the railroad in the years before that. In 1904, the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad was the only railroad that remained operational during the third flood of the Susquehanna Valley of that year. In 1912, a sawmill in Jamison City went out of business, which was the event that started the decline of the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad, and a tannery going out of business in Jamison City in 1925 furthered the railroad's decline. Eventually, railroad service north of Benton stopped, and in 1925, the tracks in Jamison City were removed, because Jamison City's lumber and tanning industries had faltered. The Bloomsburg and Sullivan railroad went bankrupt in 1928 and was auctioned to the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad the same year. Scheduled passenger trains along the railroad to Benton ceased in 1930. The last passenger train carrying a large number of passengers along the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad to Benton was in 1934. Freight service to Benton along the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad ceased in 1969, when a flash flood severely damaged much of the railroad, and the tracks from Lighstreet to Benton were removed. The railroad tracks in Bloomsburg were removed in 1971, following the re-pavement of 5th Street. However, service from Bloomsburg to Lightstreet continued until Hurricane Agnes in 1972. Financial information The building of the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad was primarily backed by bankers and attorneys from Philadelphia. It was financed by Benton K. Jamison. A total $500,000 were donated to the building of the railroad. In 1917, there existed $600,000 of stock of Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad company. In 1910, the railroad's net profit was $40,004, but this value had fallen to $31,936 by 1915. Although the railroad never did make a very large amount of money, it was critical to the development of the Fishing Creek valley. From 1888 to 1892, the community of Jamison City relied almost entirely on the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad. When the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad was first constructed, it had a monopoly on travel to the upper Fishing Creek valley. However, this changed in 1892, when a road to Benton was constructed. Despite this, in 1915, the railroad employed a hundred and fifty people and ran six passenger trains per day, as well as freight trains, but due to the closing of the sawmill, these values were lower than in previous years. One of the contributing factors to the decline of the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad was the advent of trucks in the mid-20th century. Route The Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad's southern terminus was in Catawissa at the junction of the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Reading Company. From there, the railroad ran up the west bank of the Susquehanna River to the mouth of Fishing Creek, and up along Fishing Creek to the community of Rupert. Here, the railroad crosses Fishing Creek and goes through the location of the Bloomsburg Fairgrounds to Railroad Street, which it parallels north to the east bank of Fishing Creek. From there, the railroad paralleled Fishing Creek to the northern reaches of Bloomsburg, at which point it turned northeast to Lighstreet, then north to Orangeville. North of Orangeville, the railroad ran on a bridge over Fishing Creek, near the point that Pennsylvania Route 487 also crosses Fishing Creek. It then headed to the community of Zaners, where it ran alongside what is now protected land for . From there, the railroad traveled roughly north through Stillwater and Benton, to its northern terminus at Jamison City, on the West Branch Fishing Creek. At the community of Central, a short branch line went in a northwesterly direction away from the main line. A 1947 map shows several other minor branch lines in the northern section of the railroad. Stations and intersections The Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad had stations at Bloomsburg, Lightstreet, Orangeville, Forks, Stillwater, and Jamison City, Pennsylvania. The Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad intersected the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Reading Railroad at its southern terminus. The Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad also intersected the Susquehanna, Bloomsburg, and Berwick Railroad in northern Scott Township, and the Lackawanna and Reading Railroad in Bloomsburg. The Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad's station for passengers in Benton was on Market Street, and the station for freight was located slightly north of the passenger station. The railroad's station in Benton was known as the Benton Station. Despite the fact that the railroad tracks to Jamison City were removed in the 1920s, the former railroad station at Jamison City still exists as of 2020. Another train station on the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad was known as the Laubach Station. Uses Most of what trains on the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad carried were wood and farm products. However, the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad also provided passenger trains, and freight trains carrying lumber and leather from Jamison City and rock lime also traveled on the railroad. The railroad also provided access to the Bloomsburg Fair. Other uses included carrying animal hides to Jamison City, where there was a tannery; paper from two paper mills along the railroad; and mining materials from the community of Forks.

Secondary missions: * Execute search and rescue operations; * Execute general air transport operations; * Provide support for fire fighting operations. (currently not applicable) History Formed on September 23, 1977, with the initial designation of Transport and Maritime Patrol Squadron (), its origins date back to 1952, when upon the merger of the Army's Aviation and the Naval Aviation these services' transport aircraft ‚Äî Junkers Ju 52, C-54 Skymaster and C-47 Dakota ‚Äî were transferred to the Portuguese Air Force (PoAF). With this reorganization of the Portuguese military aviation, the two C-54 Skymaster of the former Army's Aviation, which were based at Lajes Air Base transporting passengers between Lisbon and Azores, were transferred to Portela. With the acquisition of five more C-54 in 1953, the Military Air Transports (, TAM) constitutes its first transport squadron based at Portela, the 81 Squadron. Two groups of the Military Air Transports were created, the first constituted by the already existing C-54 Skymaster and C-47 Dakota aircraft, which continued to be based at Portela; and the second group was an independent unit to be equipped with ten Douglas DC-6, which was based at Air Base No. 6, in Montijo, with the motto \\"Onde Necess√°rio, Quando Necess√°rio\\" (Where required, when required). The first DC-6 was delivered on March 10, 1961. With the start of the Ultramar War there was the necessity for a medium-range aircraft capable of performing transportation in the theater of operations. Six Nord Noratlas aircraft were then purchased from the French UAT airline. A new squadron, 92 Squadron was then formed in Luanda to operate these aircraft. Later, six additional aircraft were acquired for operations in Mozambique by 102 Squadron. During the war, the transport between the continental Portugal and the oversea territories was performed by 81 Squadron, using the DC-6 and C-54 aircraft based at Portela (Air Base No. 1), while 82 Squadron was equipped with C-45 Expeditor, C-47, and Max Holste Broussard aircraft. Numerous problems with the maintenance of the DC-6 fleet appeared along the years, mainly due to lack of planning and the age of the airplanes. In April 1968, the fleet consisted of 7 operating aircraft. Meanwhile, with the decision to give the Portuguese Air Force the responsibility for the transportation of the military personnel of all the three branches of the Armed Forces, two Boeing 707s were purchased, having performed their first mission on October 17, 1971. The DC-6s continued flying between the continent and the Azores and Guinea Bissau and the C-54s were finally retired from service. From the 81 Squadron then originated the 131 Squadron, now only with a few DC-6, and 82 Squadron was renamed as 132 Squadron, with the recently acquired 707. In 1974, with the end of the war, the CASA C-212 aircraft entered service, replacing the C-47, C-45 and, in some missions, the Noratlas aircraft of 32 Squadron, based at Tancos. With the end of the war the Portuguese government then decided to transfer the 707 aircraft to TAP Portugal and to create a new medium- and long-range transport squadron, which was to be equipped with the Lockheed C-130 Hercules to replace the Noratlas, DC-6 and the transferred 707s. On September 15, 1977, the first C-130H landed at Air Base No. 6, in Montijo, considered today as the \\"Squadron's Day\\". In 1978, the 501 Squadron's initial designation was changed to 501 Transport Squadron \\"Bisontes\\".

At Bishop Lynch High School, he was a member of the drum core in the marching band and played bass in the jazz band. He was voted \\"Most Musical\\" by his graduating class. At 17, he began recording songs on a four-track recorder that he received for his graduation. By the time he was 17, he was playing many instruments (guitar, bass, keyboards, percussion, vocals) and multi-tracking the recording sessions as a one-man band. In the summer of his 18th birthday, he recorded the entire Moving Pictures album by RUSH and playing all the instruments himself. At age 19, David was a member of industrial dance band Lesson Seven with vocalist Scott Crow and keyboardist Wynne Martin. The Dallas-based group toured nationally with Nine Inch Nails, Filter, and Skinny Puppy, and opened up for The Revolting Cocks, Ministry, and many others. They had success with an international single \\"Radiation\\" that used vocal samples from 1952 movie \\"Duck and Cover\\". They had successful radio play for the song \\"Crown\\" on alternative and college radio stations across the US. The band merged with the band ITT to form Audio Assault. After the breakup of the bands, David moved to NYC to pursue his David Wayne solo project when he was 23. He was managed by Shaun Edwardes (Angelo Badalamenti, Julee Cruise, Fine Young Cannibals) and was courted by Reprise records. He recorded an EP that featured the single \\"Believe\\" that was played on alternative and college radio across the US. It was suggested that David form a band and created Stain, which lasted about a year. He then co-wrote songs with Jonathan Lacey from the band The Beautiful (the drummer, Frank, is now with Guns N' Roses) for about a year with Paul Slocum. They parted ways then David and Paul formed the band Super Secret Weapon with bass player Koa Stephens and drummer Stephen Dupree. The band played shows with Filter, Stabbing Westward, and performed shows in the south. David and Koa moved to San Francisco and started the band Cellophane Masses with drummer Lliam Heart. The band quickly became popular in the Bay Area produced an album titled \\"Senses of Seven\\" and opened up for notable bands like Buckethead and Love & Rockets. Career It was in San Francisco that David developed an interest in world music and studied artists from India and the Middle East. His growing interest in world music coincided with a personal spiritual growth fostered through yoga and meditation. He decided to start a solo project that fused world music with electronic music under the moniker David Starfire.

He made the first ascent of La Meije (Massif des √âcrins) on 16 August 1877 with his son and Emmanuel Boileau de Castelnau. Their ascent followed the south buttress Ar√™te du Promontoire, which became the \\"normal route\\".  Biography  Pierre Gaspard's father, Hugues Gaspard, came from the small village of Saint-Georges d'Entraunes in the former department of Var (department) in Provence. He was a shepherd, who spent each summer with the sheep on the long trip to the Alpine pastures in the V√©n√©on valley in the Dauphin√©. In September 1832, he married an inhabitant of the village of Saint-Christophe-en-Oisans, in the Dauphin√© Alps, and settled in the village permanently. His son was born in the village, in the heart of the Pelvoux Massif, in 1837. Pierre Gaspard took over his father's farm, which consisted of several sections of the field and a flock of sheep. In his spare time he enjoyed hunting chamois. He was a rugged and fearless man who knew the mountains beautifully. He became familiar with the entire upper part of the valley surrounding V√©n√©on, from Olan and Les Bans on the south to Ailefroide and Barre des √âcrins in the east to La Meije in the north. He had climbing ability and knowledge of the details of topography of the area, including the configuration of the glaciers. Already by the end of the 1860s he led tourists on trips to the mountains. In 1873, he scaled the ice pass of Col de la Lauze (). In 1874, he climbed the Barre des √âcrins. The following year, with the support of W. A. B. Coolidge, the Dauphin√© Tourists Association (Soci√©t√© des Touristes du Dauphin√©) turned to him for help in setting up the organization of the alpine guides. As a guide, Gaspard's two most important customers were Emmanuel Boileau de Castelnau and Henry Duhamel. A turning point for Gaspard was his first meeting with Boileau de Castelnau in 1876. The Huguenot nobleman of Languedoc liked the modest mountaineer so much that he greatly extended his stay in the mountains. With Boileau de Castelnau, Gaspard formed one of the most brilliant ropes of their era, making a dozen first ascents in the 1876 and 1877 seasons. By hunting for chamois, Gaspard became aware of a number of routes to less prominent peaks and passes. On 21 July 1877, Gaspard and Boileau de Castelnau made the first ascent of the D√¥me de Neige () in the Massif des √âcrins Barre. Less than four weeks later (16 August 1877), climbing with Gaspard's son (Pierre Gaspard fils), they conquered the last of the great, difficult, and yet unclimbed peaks of the Alps - the Grand Pic de la Meije (). On 4 August 1877, Boileau de Castelnau and Gaspard tried a new ascent of the Meije by the south side, a route attempted the previous year by Henry Duhamel. With difficulty and thanks to Gaspard's audacity, they came to the end of the wall that Duhamel thought impassable, both climbing with bare feet. Forced to abandon it due to lack of time, they left a fixed rope in place. On August 16, Boileau de Castelnau, Gaspard and his son reached the top, not without difficulty: the Meije was defeated. The descent was even more challenging than the ascent, and they were obliged to bivouac on the night of August 16 on an uncomfortable ledge, but managed to return to La Grave the following day. Gaspard immediately became famous, and was therefore very much in demand to the extent that it was necessary to retain him in advance. In the following years he devoted himself mainly to the guiding profession, guiding more than thirty of the first parties to climb the √âcrins mountains. Of the first ten parties to climb La Meije, he led six. With Duhamel, besides the ascent of Pic Gaspard in 1878, he opened in 1880 a route on the south face of the Barre des √âcrins from La B√©rarde and the following year a new route on the southeast side of the Aiguille du Plat de la Selle. In 1885 Gaspard opened a new route to the Meije by the edge of the Br√™che. Popularly known as \\"p√®re Gaspard\\", he remained a mountain guide until an advanced age, guiding a party to La Meije at the age of 76. He guided his last party at the age of 80. He died a few months later. He was buried in the small cemetery in his native village, surrounded by mountains. In his own lifetime Pierre Gaspard was called \\"King of the Alps\\". Quiet, even phlegmatic, he was a good rope partner and camping companion: he could discuss any topic, and his wit and sophisticated sense of humor have passed into legend. He left 15 children, including six sons (Maximin, Pierre, Casimir, Joseph, Alexandre, Devouassoud), who were also mountain guides.

Delgado has spent her entire television career with Televisa. For years Delgado performed in Monterrey] and Oaxaca.El Sol de Mexico, March 4, 2010 It was not until the early 1980s, however that a staffer with Televisa's Oaxaca affiliate discovered her. Delgado was brought to the attention of producer Enrique Segoviano, who in 1982 cast her in an episode of Odisea Burbujas. This resulted in Delgado's relocation to Mexico City and she would go on to work with Segoviano frequently. She was cast as Marilu in the children's television series El tesoro del saber in 1984, not knowing that her must successful collaboration with Segoviano would come by decade's end. Delgado, along with Anabel Ferreira, would be the only cast members to stay with Anabel for its entire run. When the series premiered, Mario Bezares and Eugenio Derbez were the male cast members. By 1993 the two women were still there, but Derbez's roles were now filled by Carlos Ignacio and Luis Arcoraz IV had replaced Bezares. Delgado's two best-known characters from this series were Yadhira Davilillo, a middle-aged mother in the Coralia sketches, and as an elderly woman in several others. So identifiable was the latter role that Delgado has reprised it several times since. Delgado's elderly woman character has also appeared on, among other series, Derbez en cuando and XHDRBZ under the name of Alz (in the \\"Alz y Heimer\\" sketches) and Cero en Conducta as Jorge's (Jorge Ortiz de Pinedo) grandmother. Originally Jorge's grandmother, in recurring appearances, would try to defend Jorge and his classmates from their teacher and principal; in later recurring appearances, she would retell stories, which were acted out by the series' regular cast. Delgado also guested on Festival del Humor and Humor es...los comediantes in her elderly woman characterization. Her appearance on the latter, telecast in 2000, was ironic, as series regular Aida Pierce also would occasionally play an elderly woman in sketches. Although Delgado is primarily a comedian, she has also appeared in telenovelas, including Querida enemiga and, most recently Amorcito Coraz√≥n.

He was known as \\"The Dark Smith of Drontheim\\". He was the seventh son of Windy Cap, King of Norway. The \\"dark\\", does not refer to his working black magic, but rather to his swarthy nature. History He is generally known from the tale \\"Olave Goddardson And The Sword Macabuin\\". According to Manx legend, Baron Kitter's hunting had wiped out the animals of the Calf of Man, and the people of Man were afraid he would begin hunting their own beasts. They asked the wisest witches of the island to help them. While Baron Kitter was on the Calf, his cook Eaoch of the Loud Voice fell asleep. The witch Ada put a spell on the pot so that the fat within boiled over, setting the castle on fire. Kitter's friends, who had stayed on the Calf, decided that Eaoch had plotted with the witch to kill off the Norwegians and had him brought before the Norwegian-born King Olave, who sentenced him to death. Norwegian custom allowed him to choose the manner of his death, so Eaoch said he wished to have his head laid across the King's legs and cut off with the King's own sword. This sword, Macabuin, made by Loan Maclibuin the Dark Smith of Drontheim, could cut the hardest granite just by touching it. The Norwegians begged the King to refuse, but he would not break his word and gave orders to proceed. However, the witch Ada was there, and told them to lay nine times nine toads' skins, rowan twigs and adders' eggs across the King's legs. When the sword was laid gently on Eaoch's neck, it instantly cut it off, and cut through the adders' eggs and the rowan twigs as well - only the toads' skins saved the King's legs. Loan heard about this and was angered, since the sword was given with the agreement that it not be stained with the blood of a low-born man. He sent his hammerman, Hiallus-nan- urd, who had lost a leg in the tempering of the sword Macabuin and had a mechanical one put in place. Hiallus-nan-urd challenged Olave to travel with him to Drontheim to see the smith about the matter. Olave left, traveling by boat and foot to Drontheim. Most versions gloss over the journey, which compares and contrasts their pagan and Christian natures. By a strategy, Olave manages to be first in the door of Loan's smithy, barring the door against Hiallus-nan-urd. He picks up a large hammer and strikes the anvil, breaking it in two and turning the stone base to gravel. He spots Emergaid, Loan's daughter and learns from her that Loan is of royal blood and had caused him to come there so he could quench a new and better sword in Olave's blood. Olave seized the sword and did to Loan what he had intended for Olave. Emergaid faints at the sight, missing his killing of Hiallus-nan-urd by cutting him in two, lengthwise. Emergaid returns with Olave to Man and they are married. Creations *The sword Macabuin (Stainless) which cut through anything in its path.

Sondhi was its first President for a short while, resigning on 13 April 1950. In 2017 AFI made a lot of decision against the interest of the country and avoided qualified PU Chitra from attending 2017 World Championships in Athletics. This organisation is corrupted and need a complete system cleaning to ensure the qualified athlete are selected instead of kith and kin of AFI members. Competitions The Competitions, conducted by the AFI, are divided in three categories ‚ÄúI‚Äù, ‚ÄúII‚Äù & ‚ÄúIII‚Äù. Category I is solely conducted by AFI where as Category II includes all those Competitions, for which AFI grant permission to any other party, affiliated Units/Clubs/Organisations. Category III consists of competitions conducted by AFI but not on regular basis. Our country's valuable junior athletes are now doing exceptionally well as they are in the large group and have an astonishing ability to grab some victorious victories in the international level.

Controversies AFI has been under pressure for the last several years due to doping scandals. The entire 4x400m women\`s relay that won gold in the 2010 Commonwealth Games were tested positive for anabolic steroid. The governing body's selection process for international teams have received public criticism. PU Chitra, Ajay Kumar Saroj and Sudha Singh were excluded from the 2017 World Championships in Athletics despite being eligible for entry by the International Association of Athletics Federations (the global governing body). Chitra lodged an appeal to the Kerala High Court in July 2017, though she was ultimately excluded as the court's request for inclusion was beyond the selection cut-off date. Commentator KP Mohan believed the right decision had been made to not include Chitra and several other Asian champions, given their low international ranking at that time, though he stated the controversy could have been avoided if the AFI had made its selection criteria clear before the start of the athletics season.Mohan, KP (2017-07-31).

Founded in 1993 by two Austin-area magicians, the camp teaches magic, juggling, puppetry, and other variety arts.  History  Magic Camp was founded in 1993 by Kent Cummins and Peter Hinrichs, aka Peter the Adequate, both professional magicians in the Austin area at the time, as Kent's \\"Magic Hotline\\" personal business. In January 2007, Kent relinquished direct personal control to a board of directors and \\"The Kent Cummins Magic Camp\\" incorporated as a Texas Non-Profit Organization, receiving IRS 501(c)(3) status later that year. Magic Camp continued as a non-profit for four years until the end of 2010, when it gave up its 501(c)(3) status and re-incorporated with a new board of directors as \\"Magic Camp USA, LLC\\" and \\"The Kent Cummins Magic Camp\\" was renamed as \\"Fantastic Magic Camp.\\"  Local involvement  The Fantastic Magic Camp maintains an active presence in the Austin magic scene. Recently, the camp provided a \\"day care\\" camp for attendees of the Texas Association of Magicians' 2010 convention, held in Austin, a booth at the first annual Austin Street Magic Festival, in addition to providing volunteers to assist with both events. Volunteers from the magic camp regularly assist with the Society of American Magicians' Ring 206's annual magic auction. In 2011, the magic camp assisted with the inaugural production of Doc Seaton's Magic Sideshow, a part of Austin's Pecan Street Festival. Additionally, the magic camp can be found at a variety of family-friendly events in the Austin area, such as Waterloo park's 5th annual Ice Cream Festival.  Inclusion  The Fantastic Magic Camp is a fully inclusive camp, accepting any and all children regardless of special needs. Over the years, the Magic Camp has partnered with organizations such as Austin Travis County Integral Care, the Austin Police Department's Camp Apple, Easter Seals and Austin's Pecan Street Festival to bring the Magic Camp experience to the children of underprivileged communities.

Previously, he was the proprietor of Faaborg Pottery (1976‚Äì1978) at the city square in Faaborg, Denmark, where he designed pottery. It later evolved into the design of ceramics, tiles, carvings, pictures, oil paintings, canvas prints, drawings and photo posters, etc. Today you can still find his works, for example on eBayeBay and miscellaneous marketsCastanet where they are traded as original 70s retro design. Some of his designs typical characteristic is the use of Hogweed flowers and rushes, which often are printed on the tiles or images. But also circular patterns in various colors and provoked cracks are often seen in his design. In the 70s he worked most in those currently fashionable brownish shades, but towards the end of the 80s he experimented much with other more wild color paired with copper, silver and gold shades. Almost all of his designs bear the signature \\"P Hermann\\" in the lower right corner. The signature is roughly as seen in the picture, but it can be difficult to decipher, since it is often written with icing or marked / scratched into the subject in hand.

Sexual violence in Haiti is a common phenomenon today, making it a public health problem.https://sciencenow.unaids.org/post/eliminate-gender-inequalities Being raped is considered shameful in Haitian society, and victims may find themselves abandoned by loved ones or with reduced marriageability. Until 2005, rape was not legally considered a serious crime and a rapist could avoid jail by marrying his victim. Reporting a rape to police in Haiti is a difficult and convoluted process, a factor that contributes to underreporting and difficulty in obtaining accurate statistics about sexual violence. Few rapists face any punishment. Sexual violence potentially augments the risk of HIV infection. A Ministry of Health (Haiti) study reported there was sub- optimal utilization of anti-HIV medications following sexual assault at the largest state hospital in Haiti, L'H√¥pital de l'Universit√© d'√âtat d'Haiti. Study findings recommended the prioritization of funding and comprehensive interventions that align sexual violence, HIV and mental health to support the timely uptake to antiretroviral medications following sexual assault. A UN Security Council study in 2006 reported 35,000 sexual assaults against women and girls between 2004 and 2006. The UN also reported that half of the women living in the capital city Port-au-Prince's slums had been raped. United Nations peacekeepers stationed in Haiti since 2004 have drawn widespread resentment after reports emerged of the soldiers raping Haitian civilians. The devastating earthquake in 2010 caused over a million Haitians to move to refugee camps where conditions are dangerous and poor. A study by a human rights group found that 14% of Haitian households reported having at least one member suffered sexual violence within two years after the earthquake. In 2012, sexual assaults in Port-au-Prince were reported at a rate 20 times higher in the camps than elsewhere in Haiti. A 2009 study reported that up to 225,000 Haitian children are forced to work as domestic servants, and are at grave risk of rape at the hands of their captors. The children, known as restaveks, are traded into other households by their families, exchanging the children's labor for upbringing. Two thirds of restaveks are female, and most of them come from very poor families and are given to better-off ones. Restaveks who are young and female are particularly likely to be victimized sexually. Female restaveks are sometimes referred to as \\"la pou sa\\" which translates to \\"there for that\\"‚Äî'that' being the sexual pleasure of the males of the family with whom they are staying.  Social factors  Victim blaming is common in Haiti, which discourages people from reporting assaults against them. Rape victims and their families are stigmatized, and being the victim of a rape is considered shameful. Sometimes family and significant others abandon a victim. Women and girls who have been raped often try to keep the fact a secret since not being a virgin reduces their marriageability. This shame surrounding rape discourages reporting and contributes to the difficulty in garnering accurate statistics on sexual assaults. Due to the entrenched attitudes about women in the society, law enforcement personnel such as police and judges frequently do not take violence against women and children seriously and do not make great effort to enforce laws against it. Victims may contract HIV or other sexually transmitted infections or may become pregnant from rape and bear children, potentially an emotional and economic hardship. Drug dealing and illicit arms trading are widespread in Haiti, which contribute to a rising rate of sexual violence including gang rapes.  Law  Until 2005, rape was classified in Haitian law as a \\"crime against public morals\\", a lesser crime than assault. Prior to the implementation of the 2005 law, which was brought about after lobbying by survivors and the Haitian Ministry of Women's Affairs, rape per se had not been a punishable offense. A rapist could avoid jail time by agreeing to marry the victim or by paying her family. In addition to increasing legal penalties for rape, the 2005 law mandated that women who have been raped can receive treatment for it for free and no longer had to go only to the main state hospital but could seek it in any health facility. However, abortion is still illegal in Haiti, so those who become pregnant from rape have no legal recourse. Many women who are raped fear reporting the crime because of potential reprisals from attackers, so finding accurate statistics on sexual violence is complicated. The legal procedure for reporting a sexual assault to police is convoluted and difficult, further diminishing the number of reports made. Critics of Haitian police have called their response to reported rapes inadequate. History=Spanish Hispaniola (1492‚Äì1625)= The natives of the island initially approached Columbus and his soldiers with friendliness and generosity. Sexual violence on the part of Christopher Columbus's soldiers began almost immediately upon the landing of on the island. When he established a fortress and left for Spain in 1493, Spanish soldiers he left behind sexually abused the native Taino women and girls. In some cases they held native women and girls as sex slaves. Spanish missionary Bartolom√© de las Casas spoke out against the brutality of the Spaniards in a campaign against the enslavement of the Tainos. He quoted one Taino cacique (tribal chief) who said of the Spaniards, \\"They speak to us of an immortal soul and of their eternal rewards and punishments, and yet they rob our belongings, seduce our women, violate our daughters.\\" In a 1500 letter Columbus wrote of the slave trade in Hispaniola, \\"‚Ä¶there are plenty of dealers who go about looking for girls; those from nine to ten are now in demand.\\" Among the things the Spanish sailors brought back to the old world was yaws, a bacterial disease that the Taino women carried and that was transmitted to the soldiers while raping the women. Syphilis in Europe may also have originated in the new world, and a number of Columbus' sailors brought that disease back from the New World as well. Some women who became pregnant from rape by settlers took medicinal herbs to cause abortion. =French Saint-Domingue (1625‚Äì1789)= In the 18th century, Haiti was a profitable French colony named Saint-Domingue; its economy was based on plantations that grew sugar for export to Europe and slaves comprised a majority of the population. It was not legal for slaveholders to rape their slaves, but the laws against it were not enforced. Known as the most cruel in the world even for their time, Haitian slavers routinely tortured slaves, mutilating, burning, whipping, and raping them. Like other forms of torture, rape of slaves was commonplace. Sexual torture was also commonplace, including putting gunpowder in the anus and lighting it, and castration and other genital mutilation. Abortion and infanticide became means of resistance for slave women who bore children by whites. Sex between white male slaveholders and black female slaves was abundant and long-lasting in Haiti in the French colonial period, and always carried with it the violence and coerciveness of the institution of slavery. At the time it was common for white slaveholders to father children with their slaves; typically these men would deny their paternity of these children but they would often free them from slavery and give them land. These mixed-race people were part of a class of Haitians who were referred to as Gens de couleur or \\"free people of color\\" who were legally given more privileges than blacks but fewer than whites. Free people of color were not legally entitled to defend their women against rape by whites. Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, now known as the founder of Chicago, was one such free person of color, born in Haiti in 1745 to a wealthy Frenchman and his female slave. By the end of the 1700s there were as many mixed race people who resulted from unions between slaveholders and slaves as there were whites. =Revolutionary period (1789‚Äì1804)= After the Haitian revolution former slaveholders circulated pamphlets decrying crimes including rape against whites by Haitians in an attempt to pressure their government to re-initiate military hostilities with Haiti. Such propaganda made a large impact in the US, where imagery like \\"white women being repeatedly raped on the corpses of their husbands and fathers\\" terrified slaveholders, who began to fear similar uprisings among their slaves. Harlem Renaissance author Arna Bontemps wrote novels about the Haitian revolution depicting sexual violence as a means of expressing white dominance over slaves. In his 1939 novel Drums at Dusk, about the Haitian revolution, both black and white characters rape and are raped as a means of asserting the manhood and power of the rapist and denying it to the victim. =United States occupation (1915‚Äì1934)= From 1915 to 1934, the United States occupied Haiti, and rape and murder of Haitian civilians by US soldiers was commonplace. Both officers and enlisted men participated in the sexual violence, raping adult women and young girls, and sometimes holding women as sex slaves. The marines, who administered a group of Haitian gendarmes acting as police, were accused of widespread rapes of women and girls and of trying to use the gendarmes to find them women to use as concubines. Evidence exists that some military higher-ups knew of the sexual violence but did little to punish it, condoning it by denying it, questioning the virtue of Haitian women, and suggesting that raped women had actually consented. A victim blaming mentality existed among the occupiers, who thought of Haitian women as being \\"of easy virtue\\"‚Äîa mentality which served to justify and even deny the existence of sexual violence. Resentment grew on the part of Haitians and led to conflict with the occupiers. African-Americans also raised outcry about the marines' sexual violence; one reverend said, \\"in one night alone in ‚Ä¶ Port-au-Prince nine little girls from 8 to 12 years old died from the raping of American soldiers.\\" In his 1920 campaign for presidency, Warren G. Harding criticized incumbent Woodrow Wilson, referring to the occupation as the \\"Rape of Haiti\\"; however after he won the election he continued the occupation in his own presidency. =Fran√ßois Duvalier (1957‚Äì1971)= Fran√ßois \\"Papa Doc\\" Duvalier used rape as a weapon against his political opposition. Fran√ßois \\"Papa Doc\\" Duvalier was the President of Haiti from 1957 until his death in 1971. Overseeing a reign of state terrorism, Duvalier would kill large numbers of political enemies, imprison them arbitrarily, and use gang rape as a means of control. Although both men and women were targeted for violence, women in particular were targeted for rape. In some cases Duvalier himself supervised gang rapes and gave orders to the soldiers performing them, in others he had surrogates perform them in his absence. Duvalier employed an organization of ex-soldiers, criminals, and other loyalists to his regime called Tontons Macoutes. The term is Krey√≤l for \\"Uncle Knapsack\\", a reference to the bogeyman of Haitian legend who would catch naughty children and kidnap them in his knapsack. Duvalier used the reference to voodoo, as well as violence such as rape and murder by the Tontons Macoutes, to instill fear and repress opposition. The Tontons Macoutes remained active even after the presidency of Papa Doc Duvalier's son Baby Doc ended in 1986. =Jean-Claude Duvalier (1971‚Äì1986)= Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier became President of Haiti at age 18 upon his father's death in 1971. According to human rights groups Duvalier used widespread violence, including rape, as a means of suppressing opposition to his regime. Duvalier's presidency lasted until a popular uprising overthrew him in 1986. After the uprising he spent 25 years in France, and when he returned to Haiti he was arrested on charges of human rights abuses including rape; however a judge ruled that the statute of limitations had expired on these crimes. The Duvalier regimes would later become inspiration for dictator Raoul C√©dras, who modeled the use of violence and torture in his regimes after that used by the Duvaliers, but used rape even more widely. =Raoul C√©dras (1991‚Äì1994)= In 1991 Haiti's democratically elected president Jean Bertrand Aristide was ousted in a military coup led by General Raoul C√©dras. C√©dras was in turn removed by a US occupation in 1994 and Aristide was returned to power. During the C√©dras regime rape became a systematic weapon of terror to quell resistance from the populace of Haiti, a majority of which supported the ousted Aristide and was against C√©dras. Men and women alike were targeted for killings, torture, and disappearances, but women in particular were targeted for sexual violence based on their real or supposed political beliefs. Women who opposed C√©dras, or whose male relatives did, were systematically targeted for rape. Women would be assaulted on the streets, while being detained by authorities, or during paramilitary or police raids on their houses. Both soldiers and civilians sympathetic with them attacked women, targeting women's and human rights organizations as well as individuals. The regime aimed to break down the new women's rights movement which had been forming for 20 years, and which had been instrumental in bringing Aristide to power in 1990. Going into hiding or escaping the island was more difficult for women with children than it was for men who were targeted for violence. In 1994, the US military entered Haiti and the US made a deal whereby C√©dras would leave power, but Haitian military personnel who had committed human rights abuses, including rape and murder, under him would not be prosecuted. After the end of the C√©dras regime, a Haitian human rights commission found that thousands of rapes had been reported during the C√©dras regime, and thousands more were likely not reported. In early 1994, a US Embassy representative estimated that a quarter of Haitians seeking political asylum in the US out of fear for their safety were women, and one in 20 of those had suffered politically motivated rape. An April 1994 cable leaked from the US Embassy outraged women's rights advocates because it dismissed Haitian exiles' allegations of rape by security forces as lies (which human rights groups denied). Aristide was returned to power, but another coup in 2004 saw his exit a second time. 2010 earthquake and aftermath After the 2010 earthquake, more than a million people moved into tent cities rife with violence. Over a million people made homeless in the 2010 earthquake in Haiti moved into refugee camps that offered little food, work, or safety. The UN reported that as of October 2012 about 370,000 people were still in the camps and facing poor and insecure living conditions. The earthquake directly preceded a rapid increase in the numbers of sexual violence in Haiti. Factors contributing to vulnerability after the earthquake include homelessness and losing the protection afforded by a house; losing family members who might have provided protection; and increases in levels of violence due to the stress of living in substandard conditions; and lack of legal recourse to prosecute rapists. The tent cities have little privacy, lighting, or policing. Young children are also victimized. Women who need to leave their children in search of work, food, or water sometimes have no option but to leave them alone or with strangers; sometimes these children are sexually abused. Human rights group Amnesty International reports that men roam the camps in groups looking for victims, targeting young girls without the protection afforded by schools and safe play areas. Police stations and courts were destroyed in the earthquake, making access to protection and prosecution of offenders more difficult, and human rights groups have accused the Haitian government of having an insufficient response to sexual violence. The number of sexual abusers who are prosecuted is very small, a fact which has led to more rapes as rapists realize they are unlikely to face consequences. In October 2010 from human rights group Refugees International reported that sexual violence was on the rise in the refugee camps because UN forces were providing insufficient security. Although the number of rapes is thought by some to be increasing since the earthquake, gathering accurate statistics is difficult. The Port-au-Prince women's group who have been gathering statistics on rape before and after the earthquake didn't see an increase in rape reports in 2010 and after, as opposed to domestic violence reports who were on the rise. A study by a human rights group found that 14% of Haitian households reported having at least one member suffered sexual violence between the January 2010 earthquake and January 2012. In 2012, sexual assaults in Port-au-Prince were reported at a rate 20 times higher in the camps than elsewhere in Haiti. In some countries victims of pregnancy from rape have access to safe and legal abortions but not in Haiti. In the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake, not only did sexual violence rise but the birth rate in the camps also spiked dramatically, because many women who became pregnant after being raped had no way to treat their pregnancy, so were forced to give birth. Those who have money can go to a doctor and get safe abortions done secretly, but those who don't turn to medication that has other purposes - for example many women used anti-ulcer medication which can lead to hemorrhaging, infection, and other complications. =Response efforts= Human rights groups have begun holding self-defense classes and issuing women whistles to provide an easy and loud way to call for help in camps. Donations from abroad have helped to fund better lighting in the camps and safety trainings for women, and women in the camps have organized watch groups to ensure each other's security. Grassroots organizations have set up a call center and an emergency response system for sexual violence. A group of women raped during C√©dras's rise to power formed a group to help women victims of rape in Haiti called FAVILEK, which in Creole stands for \\"Women Victims Get Up Stand Up\\". People from FAVILEK and other women's rights organizations are living in the camps and organizing to help women, setting up nighttime escorts and security patrols‚Äîsometimes at the risk of their own safety due to reprisals by attackers.  Human trafficking  Poverty is extreme in Haiti, with 78% of the population surviving on less than $2 a day‚Äîa situation which sets the stage for prostitution, human trafficking, and mass violence. Both national and international crime rings are involved in human trafficking in Haiti. Adults and children are trafficked through, into, and out of Haiti for enslavement including prostitution. Common destinations for Haitians forced into sex trafficking include other parts of the Caribbean, the US, countries in South America, and the bordering Dominican Republic. Haitian children are trafficked into the Dominican Republic for use as slaves in work including child prostitution; they are sometimes kidnapped, or their families may be swindled into handing them over to traffickers. Haitian children may also be used in sex tourism inside Haiti, forced into prostitution for foreigners. Dominican women have also reportedly been trafficked into Haiti for forced prostitution. It is rare for human traffickers to be prosecuted in Haiti because the country does not have laws specifically banning the practice, and those laws that could be used against traffickers go unenforced. Efforts to prevent and investigate human trafficking and to protect victims are primarily undertaken by international and nonprofit organizations, not the Haitian government. The UN program UNICEF has funded the Brigade de Protection des Mineurs to find and protect children particularly vulnerable to trafficking. International groups reported an increase in trafficking of children out of Haiti immediately after the 2010 earthquake, since the chaos and the aid effort made it easier for traffickers to take children out of the country. Government and international officials, busy dealing with the destruction of their infrastructure, were not in a position to protect children, some of whom had lost their families. =Restaveks= A 2009 study reported that up to 225,000 Haitian children are forced to work as domestic servants, and are at grave risk of rape at the hands of their captors. The children, known as restaveks, are traded into other households by their families, exchanging the children's labor for upbringing. A 2012 report placed the number of restaveks in Haiti at between 150,000 and 500,000. Two thirds of restaveks are female, and most of them come from very poor families and are given to better-off ones. Restaveks who are young and female are particularly likely to be victimized sexually. Female restaveks are sometimes referred to as \\"la pou sa\\" which translates to \\"there for that\\"‚Äî'that' being the sexual pleasure of the males of the family with whom they are staying. Restaveks who become pregnant are often thrown out onto the street. Those who are thrown out or who run away are at risk of becoming homeless or being forced into prostitution. UN peacekeepers In 2004 the ouster of then-president Aristide led the United Nations to establish UN peacekeeping forces in Haiti. As of 2006 there were about 9000 UN peacekeepers in Haiti. Reports have emerged that some of the peacekeepers, there to provide security and humanitarian aid, have raped Haitian civilians. The UN is not able to discipline soldiers itself; rather, they are sent back to their home countries, and it is difficult for the UN to follow up to determine what if any punishment they received. One man says he was raped by six Uruguayan UN peacekeepers on a Port-Salut UN base‚Äîvideo of the event taken by one of the soldiers was circulated widely in the town, sparking outrage. The Uruguayan military prosecuted the soldiers on charges of allowing a civilian onto the base and shirking their duties, and the men also face charges of rape in civilian court. The soldiers' commanding officer was fired as a result of the incident. In September 2011, the president of Uruguay wrote a letter of to the president of Haiti apologizing for the rape. In March 2012, two UN soldiers from Pakistan were tried in a Pakistani military tribunal in Haiti for the January 2012 rape of a 14-year-old boy; they were each sentenced to one year in prison.

The game centres on the time period of 1805-1820. It started life as a sequel to AGEOD's Napoleon's Campaigns, and was originally titled Napoleon's Campaigns II. As AGEOD was bought by Paradox, they developed and retitled the game. Virtual Programming released a Mac OS X version of the game on May 9, 2013. Gameplay March of the Eagles is a game that allows the player to control any of the major European powers during the Napoleonic Wars. Like other Paradox strategy games, the player makes decisions based around the armed forces, production, and diplomacy. March of the Eagles also incorporates different victory conditions for different nations. =Domination= France starts as the dominant land power in the game, and Great Britain starts as the dominant naval power. A major focus of the game is on coalitions, which can only be formed by either dominant power. So if Russia replaced France as the dominant land power, it would lead the coalition against the dominant naval power (Great Britain at the beginning). An in-game ledger will allow the player to keep track of who is dominant, and who their closest rival is. Any other country can become dominant by taking control of specific provinces. For major powers, Land Dominance and Naval Dominance are crucial factors in victory, and for minor powers, it is the success of your alliance which can lead to victory. =Ideas= The game also uses \\"ideas\\", which replace the technology tree used in similar Paradox games. Idea points are gained through battles, and losing a battle can earn your nation more idea points than winning, balancing the game as it goes on. Ideas can have a wide-ranging effect on the country, affect land combat, naval combat, finance, and manpower. The major powers also have a section of ideas specific to them. Unlike some other strategy games from Paradox, you can customize the formation of your armies to (for example) determine which units go on which flanks. =Major powers= The major powers in the game are: * French Empire  *24px Kingdom of Spain  United Kingdom  =Minor powers= The minor powers in the game consist of the other European states in existence in 1805, such as the Batavian Republic. Development Chris King (who also worked on other Clausewitz Engine based Paradox games such as Victoria II and Sengoku) was the game designer for March of the Eagles. Originally, it was called Napoleon's Campaigns II. The original Napoleon's Campaigns was released by AGEOD in 2007, and Paradox acquired the company in December 2009. Paradox had a vision to create the sequel drawing on the war influences of Hearts of Iron, the look and feel of Europa Universalis, and the ability to \\"win\\", such as in Sengoku. The beta was released in August 2012. Reception Upon release, the game had an aggregated score on 73 on Metacritic. Writing about the game, IGN said \\"March of the Eagles may have more limited ambitions than its grand strategy cousins, but in limiting its goals it makes its successes more evident. It's a relatively brief and accessible strategy experience that's good alone and better with friends.\\" It also received praise for its multiplayer mode in particular. Destructoid said \\"The diplomacy, backstabbing, and rivalry that I love so much remains very much intact when you add in human opponents, especially in a LAN setting, and it was genuinely one of the most enjoyable experiences I've ever had with a grand strategy title.\\" However, some reviews (including IGN) did comment on the perceived lack of depth in comparison to other Paradox titles.

The light was first lit in 1848 using a first order Fresnel lens; it was the second lighthouse completed on mainland Australia and it remains the oldest surviving lighthouse in mainland Australia.Cape Otway Lightstation It was decommissioned in January 1994 after being the longest continuous operating light on the Australian mainland.

Scammell (May 1891), Fiji (September 1891) and the Casino in 1932. The first American vessel sunk during World War II, the SS City of Rayville, was also sunk off the Cape by a German mine in 1940, which sank less than 24 hours after the British Ship S.S. Cambridge off Wilsons Promontory. The Americans built a radar bunker on the cape in 1942 which is now open to the public. The lightstation was decommissioned in January 1994 after being the longest continuous operating light on the Australian mainland. It has been replaced by a low powered solar light in front of the original tower whose focal plane is at 73 m above sea level. Its light characteristic is three white flashes every 18 seconds.

The district had more than 400 students in prekindergarten through grade 12 and employed more than 75 teachers and staff for its two schools (Norphlet Elementary School and Norphlet High School) and district offices. The final superintendent was Albert Snow. By 2014 the Norphlet school district had 388 students. Under Arkansas law a school district with fewer than 350 students for two or more consecutive years could be forced to merge, and the Norphlet district leadership decided to voluntarily consolidate with another school district instead of being forced to merge. Some members of the ABE expected Norphlet to choose consolidation with the El Dorado School District due to that district's El Dorado Promise university scholarship program and were surprised when Norphlet instead chose Smackover. On May 8, 2014 the Arkansas Board of Education (ABE) approved the merger of the Norphlet School District into the Smackover School District, effective July 1, 2014, forming the Smackover-Norphlet School District.

She began her career in entertainment as a production assistant and photographer for two of her father's early HBO specials: George Carlin: Again! and Carlin on Campus. By 1993, she had left her first husband and graduated magna cum laude from UCLA with a B.A. in Communications Studies.Kelly Carlin ‚Äì Bio In 1994, Carlin co-wrote the episode \\"George Pulls the Plug\\" for the second season of The George Carlin Show with her second husband, Robert McCall. She also co- wrote the script for the 1998 film Devil in the Flesh starring Rose McGowan. In the late 1990s she began to stray away from mainstream media and began writing, producing and hosting an early Internet series, as well as performing a one-person show entitled \\"Driven to Distraction\\" about her childhood, struggles with drugs and alcohol, poor personal relationships, and her mother's untimely death in May 1997. In 2001, she earned a master's degree in Jungian depth psychology and expressed an interest in becoming a therapist, but later returned to stage performing.

The building is constructed in b√©ton brut (rough-cast concrete) and is part of the initial architecture style we know today as brutalism. The structure was built with on site prefab cast concrete panels and poured ceiling slabs. It is an early example of plattenbau and high-rise residential buildings. The Modulor system is the base measure of the Unit√© and Corbusier used not more than 15 Modulor measures to construct the entire structure form. It is located near the Olympiapark Berlin.  History  The original name of the building was Unit√© d‚ÄôHabitation, type Berlin and is a variation of Le Corbusier's concept of a Radiant City or Housing Unit; it is now known as Corbusierhaus. It was part of the planning efforts for an international residential housing exhibition in Berlin in 1957, the (Interbau) 57 or IBA 57. Large number of the leading international architects of the modernist era were invited to design and build residential housing units in the Hansaviertel in West Berlin. Big architectural stars of the time came to Berlin and created themes modern versions of social housing. Walter Gropius, Oscar Niemeyer, Max Taut, Frei Otto, Aalvar Aalto and many participated. The post war isolation of West Berlin had made it difficult to rebuild the city and by the 1950s there was still a huge demand for housing and many parts of the city were still in ruins. At the same time the East German government, with support from the Soviet Union, had built a whole new housing section in East Berlin called the Karl-Marx-Allee. Bauhaus architects who had stayed in east Germany were leading these efforts, although the style of these buildings was Socialist realism or Neoclassicism and not modernist while the urbanism was modern. In an effort to compete with the East German accomplishment, and also to supply affordable housing to West Berliners, the Senate of West Berlin together with the West German Government created the IBA. A special housing law, the LEX IBA, was created especially for the international architects. This law was more open to ideas that were not compliant with the local building code of the time. Le Corbusier had just completed his Unit√© in Marseille in 1952 and it was arguably the most famous social housing project in the world and it was especially him who was invited to participate in the IBA. Walter Gropius said about the Unit√©: \\"Any architect who does not find this building beautiful, had better lay down his pencil.\\" Corbusier's idea was to \\"provide with silence and solitude before the sun, space and greenery, a dwelling which will be the perfect receptacle for the family\\", and to \\"set up, in God's good nature, under the sky and in the sun, a magisterial work of architecture, the product of rigour, grandeur, nobility, happiness and elegance\\". Another variation of the Unit√© had been almost finished in Nantes-Rez and it was clear that it was possible to create another copy in Berlin. However the building's mass was deemed too large for the city center of Berlin and another location further outside the city was considered. Corbusier had the choice between a few empty lots the city had to offer and he finally chose the site between the Olympic Stadium of the 1936 German Olympics and the very big mountain of rubble of the ruins of the demolished city buildings of WWII. The site is called ‚ÄûHeilsberger Dreieck‚Äú, a triangle between Heilsberger Allee (today Flatowallee) and S-Bahn-Trasse. It is located closely to the Heerstrasse which connects in a straight line to the Brandenburg Gate and the Berliner Schloss. Conception for the building started in 1956 and the original plans show a building very similar to the Unit√© at Nantes-Rez. The building site is a sandy ground and the pilots on the ground floor had to be doubled in order to create a stable structure. Most of the big ideas of the Unit√© in Marseille and Nantes were part of the plan in Berlin; an accessible roof terrace, a kindergarten, stores and businesses on the 5th floor, and a social service areas throughout the building. However the authorities in Berlin and the developer cancelled most of these amenities. Corbusier fought very hard to keep the buildings elements in the planning but he eventually failed due to insufficient contracts. He had left the planning of the interior of the building to the Berlin authorities and he was only in charge of the design of the exterior structure of the building. However even the structure of the building was altered. A lengthy fight in the press and media of the time was fought about the ceiling height and other issues of the building. The result was that Corbusier's 226cm height was changed to 250cm. This change resulted in a modification of the entire building structure and of the apartments. In an attempt to recreate the golden section between apartment height of 266cm and width of 399cm, the width of the apartments was widened which made the entire building wider and higher.https://www.elledecor.com/it/case/a21282163/appartamento-unite-d- habitation-le-corbusier-ristrutturazione-philipp-mohr/ The interior of the apartments and hallways are similar in plan to Corbusiers Unit√© in Marseille and Nantes but the open plan was not realized. The Berlin Building Department deemed it not legal to combine living areas such as kitchen and living room and definitely permitted can open connection of living areas and bedrooms. The result was that the two level gallery was closed and each area was walled in and doors were installed throughout the apartment layout. The steel and wood staircase designs by Jean Prouv√© and the kitchen designs by Charlotte Perriand were not realized in this building. Plans for the stair and kitchen did exist in 1956 but were then cancelled. Another big change was that a majority of the split level units were cut in half and made into one bedroom units. Only on the two top floors were the Corbusier apartments built in full size. On 17 Floors there are 530 apartment units in total, compared to the 337 units in the original Marseille Unit√© of 1952. There are 173 one bedroom, 267 two bedroom, 85 three bedroom, 4 four bedroom units and one unit has five bedrooms. There are also a small number of offices and business in some of the units today. All units extend over two floors and they are reached through a wide center hallway or here called Street, Strasse or french Int√©rieures. This hallway does have the Corbusier modular height of 226cm. Andr√© Wogenscky was the head of Corbusier's architecture office in Paris and he was in charge of oversight in Berlin. He had an office in the adjacent south hostel building which was part of the ensemble and which is today a Kindergarten. Several Architects in Berlin were the Berlin contact offices and translated the French plans into German and made all the aforementioned alterations. The Berlin Architect J√ºrgen Sawade interned in the planning offices and on the construction site and later lived in the building. A good quality of the building is the location amidst the Grunewald and on a elevated level. This is granting ample views and sunlight for all residents. According to Corbusier the view of the sky and nature is a vital part of modern architecture. Each unit has light and a late balcony and privacy. A small shop was installed in the lobby and is the only common service left in the building today.

M√§rz 2007, S. 20 The building was later called Corbusierhaus and has been protected by the Berlin Denkmalschutz since 1996. The Reichssportfeldstra√üe was renamed Flatowallee in 1997; today's address is Flatowallee 16. The apartments were initially social housing units for rent and applications with proof of income had to be filed in order to get a contract. In the 1979 the building was privatized and the units were for sale. Renters had the right of first refusal. Many parts of the building had to be renovated and various areas had not been finished by the original developers. Over the years the condominium board invested in renovations and projects such as building a parking lot and an entrance lobby. https://www.bauenimbestand24.de/die-wohnmaschine- generalueberholt/150/43372/ The original power station was removed, a laundry room on the top floor was removed and turned into storage. In recent years the south facade has been entirely renovated and the Wwst facade is currently on the way of reconstruction. The colors of the exterior were designed by Corbusier together with the painter Fernand L√©ger. https://www.centrepompidou- metz.fr/en/le-corbusier-and-l-ger-polychromatic-conversations The base of the color scheme is Corbusier's own collection of pigment and chemical colors, called the color keyboard of polychromy of 1931. In 1959 he created a new version of the keyboard. The only known source of the individual color design for the Berlin Unit√© facade is a painted wood model which is today archived at the Berlinische Gallery. Original plan drawings of the building can today be found in the archive of the Corbusierhaus, the Berlin building apartment and the Foundation Le Corbusier, Paris. Corbusierhaus plans from the Foundation are also available among 400,000 other documents on DVDs through the publisher Echelle-1. http://e1-intl.com Recent renovations of the apartments have been made by individual owners, designers and architects. https://www.archdaily.com/896624/apartment-in-le-corbusiers-unite-dhabitation- renovated-to-original-design-by-philipp-mohr https://www.baunetzwissen.de/elektro/objekhttps://www.archdaily.com/896624/apartment- in-le-corbusiers-unite-dhabitation-renovated-to-original-design-by-philipp- mohrte/wohnen/wohnung-402-im-corbusierhaus-berlin-4538935 http://www.sparch.de/apartment-605/ http://www.hotze.net/corbusierhaus/corbusierhaus/deutsch.html Le Corbusier's utopian city living design was repeated in four more buildings with this name and a very similar design: * 8 unbuilt Unit√© d'habitation buildings in St. Di√©, France http://usine.duval.free.fr/deutscher_text.htm * Unit√© d'habitationMarseille in 1952, * Unit√© d'Habitation of Nantes-Rez√© in 1955, * Unit√© d'Habitation of Briey in 1963, * Unit√© d'Habitation of Firminy-Vert in 1965.

In the Western world, it is often associated with the Salafist jihadism.Dr Abdul Haqq Baker, Extremists in Our Midst: Confronting Terror, Palgrave Macmillan, 2011 Sufism is associated with the rectification of the soul (tasawuf) and is mainly focused in becoming a better Muslim and person to achieve a higher status in paradise, mostly following the Islamic saints and pious leaders.An Introduction the Modern Middle East: History, Religion, Political Economy ...

History Much of the antagonism against Sufism by Salafists is attributed to the writings of the eighteenth century figure, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, and those who followed him. Some argue that his original followers were more conciliatory towards what they viewed as Sufism, with the son of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab writing, > \\"We do not negate the way of the Sufis and the purification of the inner > self from the vices of those sins connected to the heart and the limbs as > long as the individual firmly adheres to the rules of Shari‚Äòah and the > correct and observed way.\\" Following a tripling in the price of oil in the mid-1970s and the progressive takeover of Saudi Aramco oil company between 1974 and 1980, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia acquired large sums of revenue from oil exports. It began to spend tens of billions of dollars throughout the Islamic World to promote the movement of Islam favored in that country ‚Äî known as Salafi Islam.Kepel, Gilles, Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam Belknap Press of Harvard University Press (31 March 2003)|2002|pp=69‚Äì75How Saudi petrodollars fuel rise of Salafismfrance24.com 30 September 2012documentary The Qur'an aired in the UK, The Qur'an review in The Independent According to Pnina Werbner, Saudi funding of \\"the Wahhabi/Salafi critique\\" (along with the forces of modernization) put \\"Sufi tariqas\\" in \\"danger of disappearing altogether\\" in the 1970 and 80s. Though the tariqas have \\"revived themselves\\" since then, Werbner describes the twenty-first century as dawning \\"with battle lines drawn up between\\" the two groups \\"within the world of Sunni Islam.\\" Islamopedia.org states that Salafi groups have been \\"accused of perpetrating the destruction and burning of a number of Sufi mosques and shrines\\" as of 2011, a \\"reflection of the resurgence of the long suppressed animosity\\" between the two groups. The eighteenth Grand Mufti of Egypt Ali Gomaa, himself an adherent of Sufism, criticized this trend as unacceptable. Difference in beliefs and practices There are a number of beliefs and practices where there is contradiction of interpretation and \\"authenticity\\" between Salafis and Sufis as \\"Islamic\\" or \\"un-Islamic\\": *Physical characteristics of Allah: Sufis believe that, Allah is invisible, regardless of shape and omnipresent (or both omnipresent and dweller in Arsh), and Arsh (throne of Allah) is a metaphor for His greatness, not or more than His dwelling place. Salafis believe that, Allah is unknowingly visible and of unknowingly unique shape, He is not omnopresent and dwells in Arsh, and He will show His face to the dwellers of heaven as the final gift at the last stage of the judgement day. * Tariqat or tariqah (religious divisional order/school) and fiqh-i-madhhab (juripridencial order/school) - Sufis, believe in tariqat, a school of mystic learning, following a teacher called murshid by the followers called murid, where salafis reject the concept of tariqah. Sufis mostly follows Fiqh-i-Madhhab with more strict manner, where Salafis don't strictly follow but study and take regional collective influence (without denominational inclusion) from the juripridencial schools named fiqh-i-madhab following the specific faqihs (jurists). *Marifat (concept of devine hidden knowledge) - Sufis believe in concept marifat, where salafis deny it. *Walayah (Friendship/ nearness/ guardianship of Allah) and Karamat (miraculous sign) - Sufis believe that besides following Quran and hadith, getting karamat (connection with devine miracle) is the sign of having higher rank of walayah, where salafis believe that following Quran and hadith strictly is the only sign of having walayah, and there is no relationship between qaramat and rank of walayah. Sufis believe that walis (gainer of walayah) have control over karamat, where salafis believe that walis have no control over karamat. *Tazkiah (self- purification) - Sufi belief states that suhbat (company) any specific master is mostly needed (shaikh or pir) for the help or intercession of inner- purification. Salafis believe that, for purification of innerself, the company of all the religious, pious, honest and wise people is equally needed. But, Both Sufis and Salafis uses the quranic concept of three states of reforming nafs in the interpretation of Tazkiah. *Ruh (soul), Nafs (instinct) and lataif-i Sitta (the six subtleties) - For describing ruh and nafs, Sufis use the term of Lataif-i Sitta, where Salafis reject the idea. *Definition of bid‚Äòah (innovation in religious matters) ‚Äî traditional Sufi scholars argue for an inclusive, holistic definition whereas Salafi scholars argue for an exclusive, literal definition that entails anything not specifically performed or confirmed by the Prophet. *Mawlid (celebration of the birth of the prophet Muhammad) ‚Äî considered bid‚Äòah by Salafis. *Urs (commemoration of the death anniversary of Sufi saints) ‚Äî considered bid‚Äòah by Salafis. *Nasheed (poetry in praise of the prophet Muhammad) ‚Äî opposed by Salafis. However, Some Salafis consider poetry in praise of the prophet with no music to be permissible. *Dhikr ceremonies (remembrance of God) ‚Äî opposed by Salafis.Salafi intolerance threatens SufisWhat Is the Difference Between Sunni, Shiite and Sufi Muslims? *Tawassul (intercession) the act of supplicating to Allah through a prophet, pious person or Sufi saint, living or dead. According to Salafis, \\"relying on an intermediary between oneself and Allah when seeking intercession\\" is among the \\"ten actions that negate Islam\\". Some Salafis believe that a living pious man can be asked to pray to God as Tawassul. *Wasilah of Shafa'ah (intercessionary powers of the prophet Muhammad) ‚Äî Salafis hold Wasilah akin to shirk (polytheism). They argue that the prophet Muhammad was a mortal and being so is no longer alive and thus incapable of intercession on behalf of those who pray to him. Sufis hold that although not physically present in the world, the prophets, martyrs and saints are still alive (hazir nazir). Some Salafis believe that Wasilah mentioned in Quran and hadith can be taken like Wasilah of good deeds or Wasilah of different attribute names of God *Ziyarat (visiting the graves of prophets and Sufi saints) ‚Äî The Sufi practice of visiting the graves of Saints is also objected to by Salafis. Salafis believe that a Muslim can take journey to only three holiest place of Islam that is Mecca, Medina, and Mosque of Jerusalem as mentioned in of the hadith of prophet. Relations by country=Afghanistan= Due to long time torn by war between various Islamic factions, it is common to see Salafis in Afghanistan. The Taliban and Al-Qaeda's activities in Afghanistan is seen as a direct symbol of growing Salafism in the country. ISIS has sought to create Khorasan Province, to increase level of religious sectarianism in Afghanistan, which is majority following a more Sufi branch. Thus, Afghan Sufis have long accused movements like Taliban attempting to discredit and oppress Sufi population in the country. =Algeria= Algeria is traditionally a tolerant Maliki Sunni sect with an important sufi population. Thus, Algerians are known for their Islamic faith as tolerance. However, in 1980s, Algerian young people were sent by the Algerian government to Saudi Arabia for education in the Islamic sciences; while some joined the anti-Soviet war in Afghanistan. This strengthened the Da‚Äôwa Salafism, a Salafi inspired social movement, in Algeria. This had led to the brutal Algerian Civil War a decade later, which the Salafi movement, funded by Saudi Arabia, sought to create a Sharia- influenced state in Algeria. Though Salafis were crushed by the military, the war bolstered negative reputation toward Salafism among Algerians, and remains at conflict with Salafis even today. =Bosnia and Herzegovina= Traditionally, in Bosnia and Herzegovina ,which has a large muslim population, sufism is practiced by a part of Bosniaks. Yet, since 1990s during the Bosnian War, increasing contacts with Salafis was witnessed when a large number of jihadi fighters from Arab world flooded to Bosnia to \\"help\\" Bosnian muslims. Thus, followed with poor economic conditions in the country and unsettled ethnic conflicts between Bosniaks toward Serbs and Croats, young Bosnian Muslims have become increasingly attracted to the ideology. Many Bosnian Muslims have joined ISIS in the conflict in Syria. Thus, while Salafis remain small among Bosnian population, it has become an increasing wary among Bosnian Islamic community, despite Bosnian Salafis claim they only try to live a normal life. =Bulgaria= In recent years, fear over spreading of Salafism becomes more frequent in Bulgaria, a traditionally Orthodox Christian majority with a significant Muslim minority which practice Sufism.https://cdn.csd.bg/fileadmin/user_upload/publications_library/files/23175.pdf There have been alleged bases supporting and providing financial supports for Salafi movement which prompted Bulgarian police to take massive raids on several alleged Salafi mosques. In 2014, a Bulgarian imam, Ahmed Moussa, was sentenced to prison for spreading Salafism. =Cambodia= Cambodia is the home of a small, but significant Cham minority, almost follow Islam and of Sufi traditions. However, during the Cambodian‚ÄìVietnamese War at 1980s, the Cham Muslims, which were once victims of genocide by the Vietnamese, joined Khmer Rouge branch against the Vietnamese army throughout a decade and also harassing pro-Vietnamese Cambodian Government despite traumatic Cambodian genocide. This has prompted the rise of Salafism in the country, in which in recent years, have occurred and increased.http://www.genocidewatch.org/images/Cambodia_09_02_Cham_Muslim_Community.doc. =China= Salafism/Wahabbism is opposed by some Hui Muslims in China, primarily by the Sufi Khafiya, some Hanafi Sunni Gedimu and a number of Jahriyya. The Yihewani (Ikhwan) Chinese sect founded by Ma Wanfu in China was originally inspired by the Wahhabi movement, but evolved away from their origins. When Ma Debao and Ma Zhengqing, attempted to introduce Wahhabism as the Orthodox main form of Islam in China, Yihewani reacted with hostility, accusing Ma Debao and Ma Zhengqing of being traitors of foreign influence, alien to the native popular cultural practices of Islam in China, \\"Heterodox\\" (xie jiao), and \\"people who followed foreigner's teachings\\" (wai dao), and Wahhabi teachings were deemed as heresy by the Yihewani leaders. Yihewani eventually became a secular Chinese nationalist organisation. Ma Debao established a Salafi / Wahhabi order, called the Sailaifengye menhuan in Lanzhou and Linxia, separate from other Muslim sects in China. Salafis have a reputation for radicalism among the Hanafi Sunni Gedimu and Yihewani. Sunni Muslim Hui tend to avoid Salafis, even family members. Salafis in China remain low in number as they are not included in classifications of Muslim sects in China, and have just only re-established since 2000s, opposed by Sufis; though it is changing due to increasing funds from Gulf Arab states with parallel Salafi Islamic belief, notably Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar ‚Äî in exchange for growing Chinese investments in these countries. Before the Chinese Communist Revolution, the Kuomintang Sufi Muslim general Ma Bufang, backed the Yihewani (Ikhwan) Muslims and persecuted the Salafi / Wahhabi Muslims‚Äîforcing them into hiding, preventing them from moving or worshiping openly. After the Communist revolution the Salafis were allowed to worship openly until a 1958 crackdown on all religious practices. the crackdowns on Muslims, as part of wider Cultural Revolution in China, has led to tensions between the Government and Muslims. United by the threat, the Huis attempted to rebel at 1975, but was cracked down by the Government. Since 1980s, Muslims were allowed to practice their religion in China. =Egypt= Sufism has been called the \\"default setting\\" of Muslim religious life in Egypt\\"Sufism has become the 'default setting' for Muslim life in Egypt, in the words of a recent Carnegie Endowment report\\". source: The Sufis‚Äô Choice: Egypt‚Äôs Political Wild Card|World Affairs, September/October 2012; Salafis and Sufis in Egypt where there are 74 Sufi orders (tarikas)Salafi intolerance threatens SufisBaher Ibrahimguardian.co.uk10 May 2010 and an estimated 15 million practicing Sufis. The number of salafis in Egypt has been estimated at 5-6 million.What is Salafism and should we be worried?First Postby Venetia RaineyLAST UPDATED APRIL 20, 2011 Before the 2011 revolution Scholar Tarek Osman describes Salafis as the \\"most important or pervasive Islamic force in the country,\\" with an influence \\"many times more than that of organized political Islam.\\"Egypt on the Brink by Tarek Osman, Yale University Press, 2010, p.221 A May 2010 ban by the Ministry of Awqaf (religious endowments) of centuries old Sufi dhikr gatherings (devoted to the remembrance of God, and including dancing and religious songs) has been described as \\"another victory for extreme Salafi thinking at the expense of Egypt's moderate Sufism\\". Clashes followed at Cairo's Al-Hussein Mosque and al-Sayyida Zeinab mosques between members of Sufi orders and security forces who forced them to evacuate the two shrines. In early April 2011, a Sufi march from Al- Azhar Mosque to Al-Hussein Mosque was followed by a massive protest before Al- Hussein Mosque, \\"expressing outrage at the destruction\\" of Sufi shrines. The Islamic Research Centre of Egypt, led by Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Ahmed el- Tayeb, has also renounced the attacks on the shrines. According to the newspaper Al-masry Al-youm (Today's Egyptian), in Egypt's second biggest city ‚Äî Alexandria ‚Äî the headquarters for 36 Sufi groups and home of half a million Sufis, \\"16 historic mosques\\" belonging to Sufi orders have been \\"marked for destruction by Salafis\\". Aggression against the Sufis in Egypt has included a raid on Alexandria's most distinguished mosque, named for, and housing, the tomb of the 13th century Sufi Al-Mursi Abu‚Äôl Abbas. According to Guardian journalist Irfan al-Alawi, \\"Salafis have alleged that Sufis are agents of the west as well as heretics. The extremists want to take control of Sufi mosques, after they destroy shrines within their precincts.\\" In the governorate of al- Qalyubiya, two Salafis were arrested at the end of March 2013 after \\"a group of their followers razed five local shrines.\\" In November 2016, images were released purporting to show the execution of the 100-year-old Sheikh Sulaiman Abu Haraz, \\"considered one of the symbolic Sufi clerics and elders of the Sinai Peninsula\\". The images were released by Ansar Bait al-Maqdis ‚Äì ISIS- affiliated extremist group in Egypt which rebranded itself as \\"ISIS-Sinai\\" when it pledged allegiance to ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant). The group had kidnapped Sulaiman Abu Haraz earlier at gunpoint from in front of his house in Arish city. On 24 November 2017, a gun and bomb attack on the al- Rawda mosque (known as the birthplace of the founder of Sufism in the Sinai Peninsula) killed more than 305 people and injured more than 128, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in Egyptian history and the second deadliest attack in 2017.Adam Taylor, How parts of Egypt's rugged Sinai peninsula have become a terrorist hot spot, Washington Post (24 November 2017): \\"It will also reaffirm that the Sinai Peninsula is one of the deadliest places for terrorist attacks in the world. The attack in Bir al-Abd is the second-deadliest terrorist attack of 2017 to date, second only to a suicide bombing last month in Mogadishu, Somalia, that left more than 358 dead.\\" The mosque in Bir al- Abed in the northern Sinai was attacked by around forty gunmen during Friday prayers. As of late November, no group had claimed responsibility for the attack, but it appeared to bear \\"all the hallmarks\\" of an attack by ISIS, and occurred in a district in the Sinai where Islamic State intends to \\"eradicate\\" Sufis, according to an insurgent commander interviewed in a January 2017 issue of the Islamic State magazine Rumiyah. =France= France has the largest Muslim population in Western Europe, counting over 5‚Äì8% of French population, mainly the result of French colonization in Islamic countries. For many years, France was seen as a melting point of multiculturalism successes. However, in recent years, France has become a major target for Islamic extremists due to increasing Salafi worshippers in the country. In France, in 2015 police say that salafism is represented in 90 out of 2500 investigated religious communities, which is double the number compared to five years earlier. Extremist attacks in France was seen as the result of Salafi indoctrination among French Muslims, including attacks against Sufi Muslims. Sufi Muslims in France have long described the Salafis as dangerous and hypocritical. =Georgia= In the Pankisi Gorge, home to the Kists, a small Muslim ethnic group, the Sufi-Wahhabi split is generational. The older Kists keep Sufi traditions, but young people scorn the old practices and pray in \\"new, gleaming mosques\\". Pankisi is reportedly the \\"only place in Georgia where people keep Sufism alive.\\" Wahhabism entered into \\"a dozen Pankisi villages in the 1990s, popularized by young people educated in Arab countries\\". (The \\"Wahhabis\\" do not use the term but agree they are practicing a form of Sunni Islam \\"similar to that which prevails in Saudi Arabia.\\") Because of close family ties, there has been no violence between the two groups, although Sufis protested loudly over the tearing down of a Sufi shrine to make way for a new Wahhabi mosque. =India= For \\"nearly 700 years\\", the Sufi tradition of Islam has been \\"part of the cultural and spiritual life\\" of Kashmir. However, according to journalists Tariq Mir and Asit Jolly, Wahhabism or Salafism is making \\"deep inroads\\" into Kashmir society. Since 2000 or so, \\"Salafist preachers\\" have spread across Kashmir and that movement of Islam has grown rapidly, now making up 1.5 million of the nearly eight million Indian Kashmiris. Some 700 well patronized mosques and 150 schools have been built in Kashmir by the \\"religious and welfare organisation\\", Jamiat Ahle Hadith funded primarily by Saudi Arabian sources. According to state police and central intelligence officers, this construction is part of $35-billion program reportedly devoted to the building of mosques and madrassas in South Asia. Kashmir's predominantly Sufi-Hanafi community is reportedly anxious over Jamiat Ahle Hadith's rapid proliferation, its increasing popularity among youth, and \\"mysterious fires\\" in 2012 that left six Sufi places of worship either completely or partially burnt (although investigators have so far found no sign of arson). Journalist Mir wonders how Sufism will fare against Wahhabism/Salafism inroads \\"in an age of globalization, free travel, and religious satellite channels\\". Many Sufi Barelvis believe that the beneficiaries of Saudi largesse are not just the Ahl-e-Hadith (who come closest to Wahhabism) but also the variety of Sunni Islam espoused by seminaries like the Darul Uloom Deoband and Nadwatul Ulema. The term \\"Wahabbi\\" in India can have contradictory definitions depending on the user of the term, according to author Yoginder Sikand. It is used by Barelvi and related Muslims to refer to Sunni critics of \\"practices associated with the shrines of the Sufis\\". These critics being principally Deobandi and Ahl-e Hadith Muslims. Deobandi used the term to refer to the more strict Ahl-e Hadith who oppose taqlid (‚Äòimitation‚Äô) of one of the four Madhhab (major schools of Sunni jurisprudence), and any form of Sufism. The Ahl-e Hadith refer to themselves as \\"Salafi\\" not Wahabbi.‚ÄòWahhabism‚Äô in India|Yoginder Sikand |indianmuslims.in |2 November 2007 =Indonesia= Being the world's largest Muslim population, Indonesia has a surprising record of religious tolerance. Nonetheless, despite the level of tolerance, it has become more varied and sometimes even growing sectarianism. A part of Indonesian Muslims belong to the traditional Sufism, while Salafism has arrived by recent years due to close tie between Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. This prompted the rise of religious intolerance, as Indonesians of Sufi faith has reacted with hostility against increasing Indonesian Salafis, who accused Salafis for ruining Indonesian traditions. Indonesian Salafis and Sufis have been living uncomfortably together, marking by the fact of heavy disputes between their versions of faith in the country.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/29465109_Modernity_and_Islamic_Spirituality_in_Indonesia%27s_New_Sufi_Networks Saudi Arabia has been quietly branding and increasing the presence of Salafism in the country, and there has been a number of students from Indonesia to study Saudi Wahhabism to become its clerics. Following Surabaya bombings in 2018, increasing anti-Salafism was witnessed among Indonesian Muslims of Sufi belief. =Iran= While Iran is a majority Shia country, it has a significant Sunni minority population, including those of Sufi and Salafi belief. When the theocratic Shia regime was founded in Iran at 1979, it is met with heavy opposition from the Sunni minority, and Iranian Sufi leaders have acted as ringleaders for democracy to be restored in Iran. Due to increasing repression by the Shia regime, it has led to the increase of Persian Salafism as an encounter against the Shia Government, and also the Sufi minority in the nation. As for the result, Iran sought to increase tie control over Salafis in the country. Overall, Sufis are persecuted by the Iranian establishment since their peace-loving Islam is viewed as a threat to the system. =Jordan= Jordan is a majority Sunni country but follow a moderate version of Islam, the result of the Hashemites who introduced Sufi Islam into the country. However, due to bordering with a more extremist Saudi Arabia, and unstable neighbors like Iraq, Palestine and Syria, Jordan has always been affected by the radicalization of Salafism. Salafism is omnipresent in the Jordanian society. A Jordanian Salafi cleric, Mohammad al-Shalabi, is the head of Jordanian Jihadi Salafist Movement, which sought to purify Islam and introducing a more strict version of Islam in Jordan, which was known for tolerance. It had resulted with the riot in Ma'an. Furthermore, Jordan has always been divided between sectarianian groups, prompted fear over anti-Sufi attitudes in a majority Sufi Jordan. =Libya= Prior to the regime of Muammar Gaddafi, Libya was a monarchy, whose king was head of the Senussi Sufi order. The flag of that kingdom was used by the rebels who overthrew Gaddafi in 2011. Following the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, more than 530 Sufi cultural sites across Libya were deliberately destroyed or damaged. While as of 31 August 2012 \\"no group has claimed responsibility\\" for the attacks on the sites, the Interior Minister Fawzi Abdel A‚Äôal was quoted describing the attackers as \\"groups that have a strict Islamic ideology where they believe that graves and shrines must be desecrated,\\" an apparent reference to Salafists.Libya: Stop Attacks on Sufi Sites hrw.org 31 August 2012 The BBC has also identified the destroyers as \\"Salafist Islamists\\". In September 2012, three people were killed in clashes between residents of Rajma (50 km south-east of Benghazi) and \\"Salafist Islamists\\" trying to destroy a Sufi shrine in Rajma, the Sidi al-Lafi mausoleum.Libya clashes break out over Sufi shrine attack bbc.co.uk7 September 2012 In August 2012 the United Nations cultural agency Unesco urged Libyan authorities to protect Sufi mosques and shrines from attacks by Islamic hardliners \\"who consider the traditional mystical school of Islam heretical\\". The attackers have \\"wrecked mosques in at least three cities and desecrated many graves of revered Sufi scholars\\".UNESCO urges end to attacks on Libyan Sufi mosques, gravesReuters29 August 2012 However, the destruction and desecration did not cease with the Libyan Civil War. In April 2016, Salafists destroyed the shrine and graves of martyrs of the Italian occupation in the town of Misrata. =Mali= In Mali, Sufis and Salafis are subject to a \\"deep religious divide\\" following the destruction of the Sufi shrines and tombs by Salafis in the north of that country, according to the Africa Report. From April 2012 to January 2013 the Islamist Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (JamƒÅ øat at-taw·∏•ƒ´d wal-jihƒÅd fƒ´ gharb  æafrƒ´qqƒ´yƒÅ) and Ansar Dine were in control of Gao, Timbuktu and Kidal in North Mali. \\"About 30 militants armed with assault rifles and pickaxes\\" destroyed three mausoleums 30 June 2012, and three more the next day according to witnesses. The group said it planned to destroy all 16 of the main shrines in Timbuktu. Ansar Dine, the group claiming control of the city, is blamed for the attacks. Its leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, stated \\"Muslims should be proud of smashing idols. It has given praise to God that we have destroyed them.\\" Another leader, Abou Dardar, was quoted by Agence France-Presse as saying that \\"not a single mausoleum will remain in Timbuktu.\\" The destruction was criticized not only by Sufis but by a number of Arab and Muslim authorities, political parties, and authors, and even at least one Salafi leader. Nabil Na‚Äôim (a senior leader of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad), criticized the way the Salafis in Mali handled the \\"problem\\" of shrines.¬´ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸáÿßÿØ¬ª ÿ™ÿ≠ÿ∞ÿ± ¬´ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÑŸÅŸäŸäŸÜ¬ª: ÿßŸÑÿßÿπÿ™ÿØÿßÿ° ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ∂ÿ±ÿ≠ÿ© ŸäÿπŸäÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ®ŸÑÿßÿØ ÿ•ŸÑŸâ ÿ£ÿ¨Ÿàÿßÿ° ÿßŸÑÿπŸÜŸÅEgypt TodayŸäŸàŸÑŸäŸà 01 2012 =Myanmar= Myanmar or Burma has been long torn by war and religious sectarianisms in the country. It is common to see violence of religious groups in the country, though varied between ethnics and rankings. Burmese Muslims, thus, are not out of range of violence despite of their indigenous Sufi faith. Long anti-Islamic activities started in Burma since the era of Taungoo dynasty. The Burmese king Bayinnaung (1550‚Äì1581 AD) imposed restrictions upon his Muslim subjects, but not actual persecution.Yegar Muslims; p. 10, lines 11&12 In 1559 AD, after conquering Pegu (present-day Bago), Bayinnaung banned Islamic ritual slaughter, thereby prohibiting Muslims from consuming halal meals of goats and chicken. He also banned Eid al-Adha and Qurbani, regarding killing animals in the name of religion as a cruel custom.Yegar Muslims; p. 10, lines 10-16Hmanan Yazawin (The Glass Palace Chronicle) Vol II p.312 In the 17th century, Indian Muslims residing in Arakan were massacred, providing harmful and actual persecution. These Muslims had settled with Shah Shuja, who had fled India after losing the Mughal war of succession. Initially, the Arakan pirate Sandathudama (1652‚Äì1687 AD) who was the local pirate of Chittagong and Arakan, allowed Shuja and his followers to settle there. But a dispute arose between Sandatudama and Shuja, and Shuja unsuccessfully attempted to rebel. Sandathudama killed most of Shuja's followers, though Shuja himself escaped the massacre.Yegar Muslims; p. 21, paragraph 2; pp. 22-24.Colonel Ba Shin, Coming of Islam to Burma down to 1700 AD, Lecture at the Asia History Congress.

During World War II, Britain backed the Rohingyas while the Japanese backed the Burmese; and massacres between Buddhists and Muslims became a norm in the country's long unstable religious violence. Thus, due to unstable nature of religious sectarianisms in the country, it has been under easy target of radical Islamic groups, notably Salafis. Persecution of Rohingya people is a notable example of spreading Salafism in the country. The founder of Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, Ataullah abu Ammar Jununi, has been trained and educated in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Rohingya persecution has also increased radicalization of larger Muslim community in Burma, many have complicated tie with Burmese Government. Fears of increasing persecution of non-Rohingya Muslims lead to the rise of Salafism is another problematic reasons. Nonetheless, the Burmese Government has yet to have an effective respond to violence between religious groups including Sufis and Salafis, due to lack of cooperation and heavy corruption within the country. =Nigeria= Nigeria is the home of the Izala Society, a Salafi organization established in 1978 \\"in reaction to the Sufi brotherhoods\\", specifically the Qadiri and Tijan Sufi orders. According to Ramzi Amara, > Today the Izala is one of the largest Islamic societies not only in Northern > Nigeria, but also in the South and even in the neighbouring countries (Chad, > Niger, and Cameroon). It is very active in Da‚Äòwa and especially in > education. The Izala has many institutions all over the country and is > influential at the local, state, and even federal levels. The radical Boko Haram was thought to be inspired from Salafism, which launched attacks on Sufi shrines in Nigeria, and Nigerian Sufis have accused Salafis for radicalization and terrorism. =Pakistan= Sufism has been a \\"part of the fabric of life in the Pakistan region for centuries\\" when it was still together with India.Pakistan's Sufis Preach Faith and Ecstasy By Nicholas SchmidleSmithsonian magazineDecember 2008 Salafi Islam is a more recent addition, having been introduced into Pakistan from \\"Arab-Afghans\\" mujahedeen were fighting Soviet occupiers in the early 1980s. They found common agendas and support from Deobandi movement. Salafi Tendencies in Pakistaniranreview.org10 June 2008 In Pakistan the dynamic between Sufi Muslims and fundamentalists has lately entered an especially intense phase with the proliferation of militant groups. There are hundreds of shrines to Sufi saints spread across the cities and countryside of Pakistan.Policy Brief: That Colorless Life: Attacking Shrines and the 'other' Islamjinnah- instituteBy Erum Haider From March 2005 to 2010, 209 people were killed and 560 injured in 29 attacks on Sufi shrines.according to data compiled by the Center for Islamic Research Collaboration and Learning (CIRCLe), a think-tank based in Rawalpindi In 2010 bomb attacks escalated, detonating in the presence of thousands of worshipers, and in the nation's largest cities, such as Karachi and Lahore. Five attacks that year killed 64 people. In 2017 at least 70 people were killed and 250 wounded in one bombing‚Äîof the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, in Sehwan, in southern Sindh during a devotional dance. At least some of the attacks are attributed to banned militant organizations of Salafi backgrounds.Sunni Ittehad Council: Sunni Barelvi activism against Deobandi-Wahhabi terrorism in Pakistan ‚Äì by Aarish U.

Schmidt2011 Salafist criticize dancing and drumming at shrine festivals, which in their view, does not accurately reflect the teachings and practice of the Prophet and his companions. =Philippines= Traditionally, an important part of Muslims in Mindanao, a major Islamic region in a heavily Catholic Christian Philippines,are Sufis. However, centuries of conflict between Christian Philippines and Muslim minority Moro people has manifested the increase of violence evolved from just war of independence for Moros to become a global jihadist networks bearing the name of Salafi Islam. The most notable Salafi group in the Philippines is Abu Sayyaf, which split from the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and had pledged allegiance to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in 2015.http://mackenzieinstitute.com/beginnings-abu-sayyaf- group/ These Salafis had engaged against the Catholic Philippines, instigated the Battle of Marawi which Salafi fighters occupied the majority Sufi city of Marawi. Sufi Islamic leaders in the Philippines had condemned the attack. =Poland= The Lipka Tatars, an indigenous and traditional Polish Muslim population resided in Poland, a majority Catholic Christian country, after the emergence of Polish‚ÄìLithuanian union, are a Sufi traditional Muslim population. Mostly Polonized, yet they are recognized as a symbol of European Muslim integration.http://otworzksiazke.pl/images/ksiazki/muslims/muslims.pdf Poland has a long historical religious tolerance, though varied and divided by era, and the Lipka Tatars rarely being touched, even fought for Polish Army many years despite historical rebellion and skepticism. However, increasing Salafism in Poland was witnessed in 2000s when Islamic Salafi scholars started spreading Salafi version of Islam into the community, and the exodus of Chechen refugees to Poland fleeing after the Second Chechen War, many were indoctrinated with Salafism. In 2017, clashes between Salafis and Sufis occurred when a Salafi teacher, Nizar Charif, sought to takeover a Tatar Sufi mosque, prompted tensions between Lipka Tatars and Salafis. Selim Chazbijewicz, a Lipka Tatar himself, addressed, > Experience so far has shown that they are unlikely to assimilate, or at > least certainly will not do so in the first or second generation Thus, hostilities between Lipka Tatars of Sufi belief and growing Salafi believers have been a menace on their relations. In 2018, Mateusz Morawiecki, a far right Polish politician, demanded for a ban of Muslim immigration, especially for those of Salafi belief, on conclusion that they cannot integrate within the society of the guests. Salafism is also seen with heavy skepticism and limitation in Poland. =Qatar= Qatar is the only one of two majority Wahhabi/Salafi countries in the world, other being Saudi Arabia. Thus, Qatar is often regarded together with Saudi Arabia, as the source of global terrorism, even by Sufi believers, since Qatar and Saudi Arabia both finance for Wahhabi and Salafi activities in the world. While it is common to see Qatari Sufis, Salafism is Qatar's state religion, though Qatar sought to differ with Saudi Arabia's own Wahhabism. =Russia= While traditionally Christian, Russia has a number of Muslim-majority Republics or \\"federal subjects\\", such as Dagestan and Chechnya. Vladimir Putin, the current Russian President, is thought to have taken a step in favor to Sufis in Russia. During the inaugural of new Moscow Cathedral Mosque in 2015, he official stated, > The traditions of enlightened Islam developed over many centuries in Russia. > The fact that different peoples and religions live peacefully together in > Russia is in large part thanks to the Muslim community, which has made a > worthy contribution to preserving harmony in our society and has always > strived to build relations within and between religions based on tolerance > for each other‚Äôs faiths. Today, traditional Islam is an integral part of > Russia‚Äôs spiritual life. Islam‚Äôs humanist values, like the values of our > other traditional religions, teach people compassion, justice and care for > our loved ones. We place great value on these things. His statement was thought to be anti-Salafism, has been under question for years as if Putin attempts to marginalize Salafis, many are hostile against Russian Government. Some indicates possibility of Russian Government creating a version of Russian Islam which pledged loyalty under the flag of Russia. ;Dagestan In Dagestan \\"Wahhabi\\" is the term used by most Dagestanis, although practitioners prefer the term \\"pure\\" or \\"true\\" Muslims. While Islam arrived in Dagestan in the late Middle Ages as Sufi Islam \\"infused with local customs\\", Salafists began to have an impact by way of Afghanistan after the Soviet Union crumbled in the late 1980s (although one Salafist scholar‚ÄîYaseen Rasulov‚Äîmaintains that the ideas of salafist jurist Ibn Taimiyah were already popular in Dagestan in the 16th and 17th centuries and that Salafists have always led jihad against colonizing Russians). According to the Abu Dhabi National newspaper > Salafis dislike the Sufi alliance with the government. Sufis run the > government-sanctioned Spiritual Board of Muslims, to which the official > clergy belong. They also support a secular state. Salafis do not. According to the Economist magazine \\"The Islamisation of the conflict\\" between Caucasus Muslims (in Dagestan and Chechnya) and Russia after the 1994 and 1999 Chechnya Wars \\"opened up a fierce sectarian fight between Sufism\\" and Salafism. By the late 2000s the Salafis in Dagestan \\"were winning support among young Muslims\\", while the Sufis were \\"tainted by association with a corrupt and dysfunctional state\\". Salafist are associated with the forest- based insurgency that has killed an average of three policeman a week in 2011, while police killed 100 people they identified as rebels, over a nine-month period in 2011. In October 2011, Sirazhutdin Khurikski, an influential Sufi sheikh in southern Dagestan, was killed. In late August 2012, a revered Sufi scholar Sheikh Said Afandi and 5 others were among killed in Dagestan suicide bomb attack. A seventy-five-year-old cleric in the Sufi Brotherhood, Afandi was a key Sufi leader in the North Caucasus and had publicly denounced Salafism.sufi scholar 5 others killed dagestan suicide bomb attack arabnews.com2012.08.30 Another Sufi Sheikh, Ilyas-haji Ilyasov was assassinated on 3 August 2013, just a year after Said Afandi.Murder of Leading Dagestani Cleric Signals Deepening Crisis in Sufi Hierarchy - by Mairbek Vatchagaev, Jamestown Foundation, 8 August 2013 Despite historical tensions between the two groups, as of mid-2015 \\"they are uniting in the face of twin threats: IS recruitment and the Russian government‚Äôs lawlessness.\\" In response, the Russian Government launched massive crackdowns on Salafi activities since 2015. ;Chechnya The President (Aslan Maskhadov) of another Muslim-majority \\"federal subject\\" of Russia, Chechnya, took the side of Sufism against Salafism, saying, \\"We are Nakshband and Kadari and Sunnites, and there is no place for any other Islamic sect in Chechnya. ... We cannot tolerate a situation where the enemies of Islam trample under foot the century-old traditions of the Chechyn people, desecrate the name of our saints ...\\" According to the BBC, however, his efforts \\"to ban the fundamentalist trend of Islam known as Wahhabism\\" were unsuccessful. Since 2000s, Salafi Muslims have been under Russian Government surveillance. =Saudi Arabia= In Saudi Arabia for many years Sufi brotherhoods, (also known as \\"mystical\\" brotherhoods), were proscribed by the government, and a \\"monopoly on religious matters\\" was given to the official \\"scholarly Islam of ulemas\\", according to Gilles Kepel. The official religion supported by the ulema in Saudi Arabia is often referred to as Wahhabism, but according to at least one source (Saudi author Abdul Aziz Qassim), its adherents prefer to call it the \\"Salafi movement of the Sheikh\\".There is no such thing as Wahabism, Saudi prince saysWael MahdiThe National18 March 2010]Journalist Karen Elliott House refers to Salafism as \\"a more politically correct term for Wahhabis\\" (source: ) However, the 9/11 attacks (where 15 of the 19 hijackers turned out to be Saudi), brought scrutiny to the official religion in Saudi. Amongst other things it has \\"put the brakes on the practice of takfir\\" of other interpretations of Islam by the Saudi religious establishment, according to one Sufi in Saudi Arabia quoted in a Washington Post article. As of 2006, Sufi gatherings are legal in the Kingdom though the Saudi Government doesn't trust them. =Somalia= Traditionally,a part of Islam in Somalia has followed moderate Sufism (as well as Ash‚Äôariyah theology and Shafi‚Äôi jurisprudence). Salafi theology has arrived in Somalia in recent decades via the influence of students educated at Islamic universities in Saudi Arabia and migrant workers returning from Saudi. Somali students of religion educated in Saudi Arabia, were often employed by the many Saudi institutions created to preach \\"the right theology\\" (i.e. Salafi theology) and received \\"massive economic and technical assistance\\" from their well-funded former hosts.

Under areas of Al-Shabab rule in Somali, Sufi ceremonies were banned and shrines destroyed.Al Shabab of Somalia Destroy the Graves of Sufi Saints As the power of Al-Shabab has waned, however, Sufi ceremonies are said to have \\"re-emerged\\". =Sri Lanka= On Easter Sunday 21 April 2019, the National Thowheeth Jama'ath, a \\"self-radicalised Salafi group inspired by the IS\\", bombed Christian churches and luxury hotels in Colombo Sri Lanka, killing over 250 people. Several days later a memo circulated by Sri Lankan security services stated that there was \\"credible information\\" that the National Thowheeth Jama‚Äôath, was planning another attack \\"specifically targeting Sufi shrines.\\" In an opinion piece in The New York Times about two weeks after the bombing, Sri Lankan author Ameena Hussein lamented that while Sufi mystics had been among those who introduced Islam to Sri Lanka in the seventh century, > Today, Sufism has gone underground, while radical Wahhabis and Salafis have > taken over many of Sri Lanka‚Äôs mosques.

While some families > still cling to their Sufi roots, others have found it easier to accept the > Wahhabi-enforced norms, which have affected Muslims regardless of class, > city or sect. =Sudan= According to the Beirut-based Al-Akhbar news site, conflict has been \\"simmering\\" between the two largest \\"religious sects\\" in Sudan‚ÄîSalafis and Sufis. Al Jazeera estimates that more than 20% of Sudanese are affiliated with Sufism, while 10% are tied to Salafi groups, though that number is growing. Salafis, particularly the largest and oldest Salafi group Ansar al- Sunnah al-Muhammadiyyah, oppose Sufi beliefs and practices they find to be \\"heresies and perversions\\" and have been active preaching publicly against (what they believe are) unIslamic activities. Arab Afghan Jihadist Salafists have also been active in Sudan since the 1990s, sometimes violently. In January 2012 a fight broke out between Sufis commemorating the Mawlid and salafis. > Dozens of people were injured before the Sudanese police arrived at the > scene to stop the fighting. Beyond the known differences between the two > groups on the permissibility and religious legitimacy of the celebration, > this specific clash took place in the context of rising tensions between the > two groups [(Sufi and Salafi)], that arose after unknown persons dug up and > burned the tomb of a Sufi on 2nd December 2011.

Following this disturbance and complaints by Sufis, the Khartoum government announced a ban on Ansar al-Sunnah clerics preaching in public areas. Several \\"Sufi domes and shrines\\" have also been destroyed in Sudan, something Ansar denies any involvement in.Salafis vs Sufis: A Simmering Conflict in SudanMay Alial-akhbar.com14 March 2012accessed 27 March 2013 =Thailand= Thailand is widely seen as a religiously tolerant nation, as Thai people rarely discriminate people of non-Buddhist backgrounds despite 95% Thais are Buddhists. Thai Muslims, mostly Sufis, have been active in Thai society and sometimes hold high positions in Thai Government. Nonetheless, increasing religious intolerance between Thai Sufis and Thai Salafis have been witnessed since 2000s. Ismail Lutfi Chapakiya and Sheikh Rida Ahmad Samadi, who led the Salafi reformist movement in Thailand, have been active since and often promote a more violence version of Islam in the country; however despite this, it remains a pragmatic approach trying to avoid using too much violence as possible in fear of provocation.https://mei.nus.edu.sg/event/between- puritanism-and-pragmatism-the-salafi-reformist-movements-in-thailand/ South Thailand insurgency, nonetheless, helped spreading, though slowly, the version of Salafi Islam among Thai Muslims, notably Thai Malays. =Tunisia= In an article on the rise of Salafism in Tunisia, the media site Al-Monitor reported that 39 Sufi shrines were destroyed or desecrated in Tunisia, from the 2011 revolution to January 2013. The shrines, called zawaya, are mausoleums built to house the remains of ancient holy men. According to journalists Peter Beaumont and Patrick Kingsley, > The Salafist component in Tunisia remains a small minority, but it has > prompted rows and mistrust among secularists and moderate Islamists. The > Salafists are spread between three broad groups: new small political > movements that have formed in recent months; non-violent Salafis; and > violent Salafists and jihadists who, though small in number, have had a > major impact in terms of violent attacks, arson on historic shrines or > mausoleums considered to be unorthodox, demonstrations against art events > ... and isolated incidents of attacking premises that sell alcohol outside > Tunis.Violent tide of Salafism threatens the Arab springPeter Beaumont and > Patrick KingsleyThe Observer9 February 2013 =Turkey= The Turks have a long tensions and hostility against anything Wahhabism and Salafism, due to historical experience as the Ottoman Empire. The Turks had engaged against the Saudis in a brutal Wahhabi War began at 19th century. The war, which the Saudis sought to legitimize their influence and denouncing Ottoman Caliphate, was met with anger from the Ottoman Government. War broke out and the Turks suppressed the Wahhabis, beheaded its leaders including Abdullah bin Saud, and banned Wahhabism across the empire. Nonetheless, with the end of World War I, the Turks were forced to depart and the Wahhabis soon took over Mecca and Medina. Yet, resentment against Wahhabi remains high in Turkish society, which culminated following the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. Turkey has continued prohibition and limitation of Wahhabism and Salafism across the country, and even claimed they are fighting them for 200 years. =United States= In the United States, Sufi leader Muhammad Hisham Kabbani is well known for his vocal criticism of Wahhabism. Kabbani, who moved to the United States in 1990 as an emissary of his teacher, Shaykh Muhammad Nazim Al-Haqqani, the grand shaykh of the Naqshbandi order, has described Wahhabism as being \\"like an octopus\\" because 'Its tentacles are reaching everywhere.' According to Kabbani, when he arrived in the US from Lebanon in 1990 he was shocked to hear Wahhabi doctrines being preached at Friday sermons. 'I asked myself: Is Wahhabism active in America? So I started my research. Whichever mosque I went to, it was Wahhabi, Wahhabi, Wahhabi, Wahhabi.' In 1999, during a forum organised by the US Department of State, Kabbani charged that '80 per cent' of the mosques in the U.S. were run by extremists. Following September 11 attacks, it has led to increasing resurgence of anti-Salafism across the U.S., and there have been a numerous call to isolate and remove anything Wahhabism/Salafism in the United States.https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/2018-07/SR-200_web_0.pdf =Vietnam= Vietnam has a long and complicated relationship with the Cham minority ‚Äî a recognized minority in the country, who were once indigenous in Central Vietnam while maintaining a long history of religious relations, though varied between persecution and tolerance. This complicated nature also brought the complex of relations between Salafis and Sufis in Vietnam. Vietnamese Muslim population counted over 0,5‚Äì1% of the country's total 90 million population which are overwhelmingly Buddhist with large Christian population. First spreading since 15th century, the Cham population of Vietnam went to become majority Muslims with significant minority Hindus at 17th century when Champa went to near destruction.https://www.nguoicham.com/blog/1687/qu%C3%A1-tr%C3%ACnh-du- nh%E1%BA%ADp-h%E1%BB%93i-gi%C3%A1o-%E1%BB%9F-champa/ Under Vietnamese rule, it was characterized as complex due to varied level of tolerance and persecution; and there existed two types of Cham Islam since: the Cham Bani which incorporated between Islam, Cham paganism, Buddhism and Hinduism;https://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/228403/1/ciasdp03_24.pdf and the traditional Cham Islam followed the model of Prophet Muhammad. Chams have been faithful and loyal to Vietnamese state in some chapters of history; and there were, in fact, several Muslim brigades founded by the Royal Vietnamese dynasty to wage war and keeping border.https://www.nguoicham.com/blog/2261/ng%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Di-ch%C3%A0m/ However, increasing persecutions in 19th century led to anti-Vietnamese uprising by a Sufi cleric, Khatip Suma. It was violently suppressed, and the systematic oppression of Cham Muslims continued even after the French conquest. It was the French conquest that saw the arrival of Wahhabism and Salafism in the country. Salafism, first spread by a Cham who educated in Saudi Arabia, Mohammad Badri, growing at 1960s during the Vietnam War.https://journals.openedition.org/moussons/976 Badri sought to purify Islam, accusing Cham Sufis as heretics and non-belivers. This caused a rift between majority Cham Sufis and small but growing Cham Salafi population.https://chamstudies.wordpress.com/2015/10/11/ban-dich-tieng-viet- chau-doc-muslims-vietnam-faced-with-salafism/ After more 25 years with Vietnam's ƒê·ªïi m·ªõi reforms, return of hazard religious tolerance and Badri's death, his son Abdulazim Badri continued his father's path and stayed conflict with majority Cham Sufi Muslims. In 2001, Vietnamese scholar Ph·∫°m H·ªØu ƒê·∫°t, a Kinh, accused the Cham Salafis for trying to using aids from Gulf Arab states to finance for Salafi activities, taking refuge in Malaysia to spread radical Salafism and sought them to be banned. In 2014, a Cham Salafi cleric who studied in Saudi Arabia, stated the role of women as inferior, and sought to make Islam purified in the ideology of Salafism. His statement marked with heavy criticisms from Vietnamese Muslim Association including Sufis, accusing him for being an Islamic extremist.https://baomai.blogspot.com/2014/09/thuyet- am-muu-ve-phien-quan-is.html The Government of Vietnam, having long complex relations with the Chams, maintains heavy security surveillance over both Sufis and Salafis, especially Salafi community, in fear of spreading Islamic extremism in the country; and has limited a number of Islamic scholars entering the country without possible requirements.

The property was owned by Canadian businessman Ron Joyce (co- founder of Tim Hortons) and opened in 2000. The course was designed by Graham Cooke and has a par of 72. In addition to the course, the resort has a spa, marina, hunting lodge, winery, and private air strip. History Joyce acquired the 1,100 acres of ocean-front for the property in 1987, and opened it in 2000. The remnants of a lobster-processing plant from the property's previous use are visible from the back-nine holes of the course. The resort was originally envisioned to be a gated community centred on the golf course. Houses or townhouses would be privately owned and occupied by either permanent or seasonal residents, but the resort eventually evolved into a combination of \\"private club and public golf\\". Golf course The golf course is and was designed by Graham Cooke; in 2001 Golf Digest awarded it Best New Canadian Course, and in 2009 listed it as the number fifteen in their top-twenty golf courses in Canada. The 7,205-yard, par 72 course follows the coast of the Northumberland Strait of the Atlantic Ocean. In 2010 the course saw approximately 7,000 rounds of golf played. At a private event in 2009 Tiger Woods shot the course record, a 63. Facilities The Fox Harb'r Resort includes a spa and conference centre. It is accessed by the road that was dubbed 'Amazing Grace Boulevard' by Ron Joyce, or the private air strip.

White families had immediately moved their children to Sumter Academy, a segregation academy, leaving the public schools majority black. A former chairperson of the school board stated that a successful boycott at Livingston Junior High School in 1978 motivated African-Americans to run for the school board, and in 1980 African-Americans gained three of five school board seats, giving them a majority of the school board. That year the student enrollment was 2% white. In the 2007-2008 school year it had 2,300 students. In 2009 it had 838 high school students, a factor that resulted in it merging its two high schools into one. In 2017 the total enrollment was now 1,500. Eleanor Robinson James, who had retired from being a teacher at Sumter County schools, reported that many parents had placed their children in other counties.

History  Tarrant's first school was built in 1920, and by 1930, its enrollment had grown to 1,443 students. The 1930 U.S. Census showed sufficient population, in compliance with the state code, for the city of Tarrant to operate its own schools independently from the Jefferson County School System. Therefore, in August 1930, Tarrant City Schools pulled away from Jefferson County and appointed a Board of Education. The new board voted to take over the existing elementary and junior high schools, leaving the high school, Jefferson County High School, under the supervision of the county. In 1948, Jefferson County High School also became part of the Tarrant City School System and its name was changed to Tarrant High School. Mr. W.A.

However, in Mozart's own time, these terms were used differently from the way they are used today, because the modern nation states of Austria and Germany did not yet exist.See discussion and references below. Modern Austria came into being in 1918; Germany in 1871. Any decision to label Mozart as \\"Austrian\\" or \\"German\\" (or neither) involves political boundaries, history, language, culture, and Mozart's own views. Editors of modern encyclopedias and other reference sources differ in how they assign a nationality to Mozart (if any) in light of conflicting criteria. Salzburg 1715 map showing (in purple) the Archbishopric of Salzburg Sigismund von Schrattenbach was the ruling archbishop at Salzburg when Mozart was born and during his youth. He was a generous patron of the Mozart family. Mozart was born in Salzburg, the capital of the Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg, a small, essentially sovereign state.For discussion of the independence of Salzburg see and below. Thus in one sense Mozart's nationality could be said to be \\"Salzburgian\\",In French, was, and still is, fairly common. The German equivalent is quite common. though English-language biographers do not generally use this term to designate his nationality.No sources consulted in preparing \\"Scholarly practice\\" (section below) employed this term.Mozart scholar Otto Erich Deutsch suggested that Mozart was actually not a citizen of Salzburg, but of Augsburg. Discussing Mozart's baptismal record, he writes that Mozart's father Leopold, born and raised in Augsburg (), \\"remained a citizen of that town, so that Nannerl and Wolfgang, though born at Salzburg, were actually Augsburg citizens\\" (). At the time Augsburg was, like Salzburg, a small independent state; i.e. a Free imperial city. The Holy Roman Empire The Archbishopric of Salzburg was but one of more than 300 similarly independent states in the part of Europe that was populated by German speakers. Most of these states, Salzburg included, were included in a larger political entity, the Holy Roman Empire. The Holy Roman Empire was German in various ways: most of its population was German-speaking,For the exceptions see . its official full name was the \\"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\\" (German: ), it conducted most of its business in German, and one of the titles held by its emperor was \\"King in Germany.\\" Derek Beales adds, \\"[the emperor] and the Empire were foci of German patriotism. Even in Hamburg, Protestant and remote from his court [in Vienna], prayers were regularly said for him and his birthday was celebrated.\\". The Habsburgs, who generally served as emperor (see below) and most of their lands they ruled were Roman Catholic. However, although the Holy Roman Empire was largely German, it was hardly a nation state, but only a very loose confederation, the feeble residue of an empire that had been robust centuries earlier.The history of the empire and its centuries of decline are related in detail in the article \\"Germany\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1988 edition, vol 20, pp. 47‚Äì79. According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, the princes whose states comprised the empire \\"legislated at will, levied taxes, concluded alliances, and waged wars against each other ... The imperial Diet meeting in Regensburg had degenerated into a debating society without authority or influence. The splendid [imperial] coronation ceremony in Frankfurt am Main could not disguise the fact that the office conferred on its holder little more than prestige.\\"\\"Germany\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1988 edition, vol 20, p. 76. Thus, although the phrase \\"Mozart was German\\" can be given a cultural interpretation (see below), it cannot be taken to mean that Mozart was a citizen of Germany. During his time, there was no German nation-state that he could have been a citizen of. Austria According to , in Mozart's time the word \\"Austria\\" (German: ) had several meanings. The original Austria was the Archduchy of Austria, a rather small state centered around Vienna, roughly coextensive with the modern Austrian states of Upper Austria and Lower Austria. Starting in 1282 this core area was ruled by the Habsburg dynasty.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1988 edition, \\"Habsburg\\", p. 515 Over the centuries, the Habsburgs accreted ever more lands to their holdings, both inside and outside the Holy Roman Empire, and both German and non-German speaking. enumerates the Habsburg lands thus: \\"the present-day Austrian republic (except the province of Salzburg); Bohemia (including Moravia), now the Czech Republic; greater Hungary (which embraced, as well a modern Hungary, Slovakia, Croatia and the south-western tip of modern Ukraine); Transylvania and the banat of Temesvar (both for a time treated as part of Hungary and now mostly part of Romania); the duchy of Carniola (now Slovenian); south Tyrol, much of Lombardy and certain other lands now within Italy; small and scattered possessions in southern Germany; the Austrian Netherlands (that is Luxemburg and the greater part of modern Belgium); Galicia after 1772 (now divided between Poland and Ukraine) and, after 1775, the Bukovina (now divided between Romania and Ukraine).\\" Despite this expansion, the Habsburg dynasty retained an Austrian identity, maintaining their capital in Vienna and referring to their aggregated lands as \\"the Austrian Monarchy\\". The word \\"Austria\\" was sometimes used as an informal cover term for all of the lands ruled by the Habsburgs. The power of the Habsburgs was such that they came to dominate the emperorship of the Holy Roman Empire:Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1988 edition, \\"Habsburg\\", p. 517 starting in 1452, the \\"Electors\\" (the handful of princes who held the right to elect the next emperor) virtually always chose the Habsburg monarch for the emperorship whenever the office became vacant.. A three-year exception occurred when Maria Theresa inherited the Habsburg titles but‚Äîas a woman‚Äîcould not legally serve as Emperor. During the crisis of the War of Austrian Succession, the emperorship was voted (1742) to her enemy Charles Albert of Bavaria. Following the revival of Habsburg fortunes and the death of Charles Albert (1745), the emperorship became Habsburg property again with Francis I; see main text. The emperors who served in Mozart's time were Francis I, Joseph II, and Leopold II. Of these, the latter two were Habsburg descendants; Francis I was the husband of the Habsburg ruler Maria Theresa, who held the emperorship on her behalf since as a woman she could not legally serve. For administrative purposes, the Holy Roman Empire was divided into \\"circles\\". The Austrian Circle included the original Archduchy of Austria, as well as a number of other areas now part of modern Austria. Salzburg was not included; it was part of the Bavarian Circle. In sum, \\"Austria\\" in Mozart's time could mean (in increasing order of size), the Archduchy of Austria, the Austrian Circle, and the Habsburg-ruled lands. None of these included Salzburg. Although Mozart was not born in Austria (as then defined), he had close connections there. He made three extended visits to Vienna in his youth, gives the following dates: September‚ÄìDecember 1762, September 1767-January 1769, July‚ÄìSeptember 1773. and in 1781 moved to Vienna to pursue his career; he remained there to the end of his life (1791). Maps The map below (click twice to enlarge) portrays the Holy Roman Empire as of 1789, surrounded by a red dashed line. The Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg, shaped somewhat like a thick inverted capital T, is shown in lavender in the southern portion of the map, sandwiched between the extensive Habsburg territories (shown in orange- brown) and Bavaria (pale green).The perils that Salzburg faced as a small buffer state between two larger neighbors are discussed in . The great number of small independent states that are now mostly part of Germany can also be seen. The extensive territories ruled by the Habsburgs but outside of the Holy Roman Empire are not indicated on the map. 500px For maps depicting the Circles of the Holy Roman Empire, see Imperial Circle. Later developments The political situation that prevailed in Mozart's lifetime did not long endure, with radical changes resulting from the Napoleonic Wars. Holy Roman Emperor Francis II first decreed (1804) a new Austrian Empire, consisting solely of the lands ruled directly by the Habsburgs. Two years later (1806), he allowed the Holy Roman Empire to lapse, ending its centuries-long existence. Hieronymus von Colloredo, the last archbishop to exercise temporal power in Salzburg The wars also had drastic consequences for Salzburg. In 1800 it was occupied by Napoleon's troops; the reigning prince-archbishop Hieronymus von Colloredo (Mozart's old employer) had to flee. He never again exercised political rule, though he retained his ecclesiastical title. In the negotiated settlements that followed, Salzburg was first made into an independent secular state (the Electorate of Salzburg, 1803), then unified with the Austrian Empire (1805),By the Peace of Pressburg; then awarded to Bavaria (1809),By the Treaty of Vienna; and finally returned again to the Austrian Empire (1816).By the Treaty of Munich; The Austrian Empire underwent further political evolution, ultimately disintegrating in 1918 at the end of the First World War, at which time the small residual nation of Austria‚Äîincluding the old territory of Salzburg‚Äîwas created.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1988 edition, article \\"Austria\\", p. 516. \\"Germany\\" as cultural concept As noted above, there was no country called \\"Germany\\" in Mozart's day; rather, there were hundreds of independent or quasi-independent German- speaking states. Of these, Prussia (blue on the map) was already on the rise, expanding its territory, and it was under Prussian leadership that Germany was ultimately unified in 1871.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1988 edition, article \\"Germany\\", p. 88 It was only as of that year that one could speak of a German nation-state. However, the word \\"German\\" (in German: ) was in use well before this time, designating the people of central Europe who shared German language and culture.For extended discussion on this point see . To give an example, when in 1801 Mozart's old colleague Emanuel Schikaneder opened the Theater an der Wien in Vienna, a Leipzig music journal praised the new theater as \\"the \\"most comfortable and satisfactory in the whole of Germany\\".The journal was the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung; quotation from Honolka (1990, 187). The city of Salzburg, owing to its fine ecclesiastical architecture, was sometimes called \\"the German Rome\\".Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1988 edition, \\"Salzburg\\" Mozart himself used the word \\"German\\" in this sense, and apparently felt a sense of national or ethnic pride in being German. The following passage, from a letter to his father Leopold, attests to this: A series of similar recorded utterances from Mozart is given by Kerst (1906). From this evidence, it is clear that Mozart considered himself to be German.; However, for the reasons just given, the relevant sense is necessarily a linguistic or cultural one, there being no country of \\"Germany\\" of which Mozart could have been a citizen. Roselli (1998, 10) asserts that \\"Mozart was born into a part of Europe where nationality in the modern sense did not exist.\\" Summary As can be seen, evidence is available to support a variety of opinions about Mozart's nationality. Thus, he was Austrian because the town in which he was born and raised is now in Austria, and because he made his career in Vienna, the Austrian capital., He was German because he felt himself to be German, and because the residual and moribund empire that included Salzburg was labeled as and felt to be German., He was neither Austrian nor German because Salzburg was independent, neither part of the Habsburg Austrian possessions nor part of a (yet to exist) German nation-state., Scholarly practice The scholars who prepare biographies and reference works have made varying choices in assigning Mozart a nationality. The widely consulted Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians calls Mozart an Austrian composer,Cited from the Grove Music Online edition of this work as do the Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography (2003), the Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music () and the NPR Listener's Encyclopedia of Classical Music . The practice of the Encyclop√¶dia BritannicaDiscussion here refers to the 1988 edition. is split: the brief anonymous summary (\\"Micropedia\\") article calls him Austrian, but the main article (\\"Macropedia\\"), written by H. C. Robbins Landon, makes no mention of a nationality. Sources describing Mozart as German are more abundant in earlier work, particularly before the founding of the modern nation-state of Austria in 1918. A London newspaper, reporting the composer's death in 1791, referred to him as \\"the celebrated German composer\\".Eisen (Introduction to In , Mozart is introduced as \\"the great German composer\\"; included Mozart in a book called The Great German Composers. Other descriptions of Mozart as German appear in , , and ; also (much later) . Sources sometimes have changed their practice over time. The Grove dictionary did not always call Mozart \\"Austrian\\"; the designation appears to have been added with the first edition of the \\"New Grove\\" in 1980. Similarly, Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians did not originally offer a nationality but added the word \\"Austrian\\" to its opening sentence for the 8th edition (1992) and has retained it since., 1992 and The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, now an \\"Austrian\\" source, listed Mozart as a German composer in 1911. Peter Branscombe's brief biography (2006, 304) begins with the description \\"composer and keyboard player\\"‚Äîin an encyclopedia that otherwise always specifies the nationality of composers, suggesting the omission of nationality may have been deliberate. Other authors who say nothing about Mozart's nationality (whether deliberately or not) are Hermann Abert, Maynard Solomon, and Robbins Landon, mentioned above; and among encyclopedias the Riemann Musiklexikon (1961), and the International Cyclopedia of Music and Musicians (1985). The prestigious German music encyclopedia lists no nationality, but this follows the policy it applies to all composers. Some sources mention both nationalities: the (1975) begins its article \\"composer, on the father's side of Augsburg-south German ancestry; on the mother's side Salzburg-Austrian\\".Original German . Julian Rushton, in his Mozart biography, summarizes many of the facts given above and concludes: \\"Mozart, by modern criteria Austrian, counted himself a German composer.\\" NotesReferences           * Introduction by Cliff Eisen.

It is one of the oldest and largest Unitarian Universalist churches on the West Coast and has had many distinguished members, including numerous professors at the University of California, Berkeley. It is highly regarded for its music program as well as its series of renowned ministers and its many avenues for spiritual growth, learning, and social action.  History  The First Unitarian Church of Berkeley was founded on July 12, 1891. (The name was changed to Unitarian Universalist Church of Berkeley in 1998.) Its first minister was Edward B. Payne. The church occupied rented quarters for several years, purchasing land for a building at Bancroft Way and Dana Street in 1893. Following a resolution by the Pacific Coast Unitarian Conference to establish a Unitarian divinity school, an ambitious design for the church and seminary was drawn by architect Joachim Mathisen.William Carey Jones, Illustrated History of the University of California, 1868-1895, pp. 95-97. The author, William Carey Jones, was one of the church leaders and the seller of the parcel of land. However, the Panic of 1893 intervened, and the seminary did not materialize until later, eventually becoming the Starr King School for the Ministry. A more modest design by A. C. Schweinfurth for the church alone was built in 1898.\\"A Departure in Church Architecture,\\" San Francisco Call, 26 June 1898. The redwood-shingled First Unitarian Church became a landmark of Bay Region \\"building with nature\\" architecture and still stands at the same location, now used as a dance studio on the University of California campus.Leslie M. Freudenheim, Building with Nature: Inspiration for the Arts and Crafts Home, pp. 108-113. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) since 1981. Bernard Maybeck, another leading California Arts and Crafts architect, was a member of the church and designed its parish hall, built in 1909 (not extant). (He had been out of the country during the period when the Schweinfurth building was designed and built.) He also made sketches for a Mission Revival style building for the Pacific Unitarian School for the Ministry. In the mid 1950s, the elderly Maybeck was also the owner of a tract of land in Kensington, an unincorporated area of the Berkeley Hills, which he sold at a discount to the church when it had outgrown its old building and the university had taken the property through eminent domain.\\"Jury Awards $329,400 to Condemned Berkeley Church in Path of U.C. Expansion,\\" Oakland Tribune, 14 May 1959, p. 9. A new church building on the Kensington site was designed by Wurster, Bernardi & Emmons with Theodore Bernardi as lead architect. Bernardi was a great admirer of Maybeck and said Maybeck's work influenced his church design.Mark Treib, ed., An Everyday Modernism: The Houses of William Wurster(1995, ), pp. 210 and 225 Geraldine Knight Scott was the landscape architect. The congregation began using the main building in 1961; two religious education classroom buildings were added soon thereafter. During the planning for the move to Kensington, a segment of the congregation, dissatisfied with the move and the leadership of the Rev. J. Raymond Cope, decided to remain in Berkeley proper. They formed the Berkeley Fellowship of Unitarian Universalists, which still exists at Cedar and Bonita Streets.  Loyalty oath resistance  In 1950, Harold Levering, a California assemblyman from Bel Air, proposed an amendment to the state constitution that would require all religious institutions to sign a loyalty oath or lose their tax-exempt status. The demand for a loyalty oath already applied to all public employees of the state through the Levering Act, but this was the first time in the history of the United States that a government imposed such an oath on a religious group. It was passed into the California state constitution by popular vote in 1952. Religious institutions had until March 1954 to decide whether or not they would comply. Most churches signed the oath, but the First Unitarian Church of Berkeley, led by Rev. J. Raymond Cope, joined the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles and a few other congregations (Unitarians, Methodists, and Quakers) in refusing to sign. Their tax-exempt status was revoked, but in 1958 the U.S. Supreme Court declared the Levering oath unconstitutional, and taxes that had been paid were refunded.  Music  Under the direction of Dr. Bryan Baker, the church continues a tradition of fine music production. Vocal music is performed by \\"Luminescence\\" (the main choir), a Youth and Children's Choir, and other ensembles. An Aeolian-Skinner organ, three grand pianos (Yamaha, Chickering and Baldwin), a harpsichord, and a gamelan are among the many musical instruments featured in church services and special events. The church is the home of the Kensington Symphony Orchestra and is frequently used for musical recordings because of its excellent acoustics. Andr√© Watts gave piano recitals at the church in the early 1990s, two of which were recorded on the EMI label. A sing-along performance of Handel's Messiah has been a December tradition since 1966.  Advocacy and social action  The congregation has a strong commitment to social justice and a history of progressive actions to foster human rights, world peace, and humane living conditions for all. In recent years it has especially focused on marriage equality and immigration justice. Ongoing projects also include both financial and volunteer support of the Greater Richmond Interfaith Project and its family shelter, the Contra Costa Interfaith Supporting Community Organization (CCISCO), a partner Unitarian church and village in the Transylvania region of Romania, the Unitarian Universalist Justice Ministry California, the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee, and numerous other organizations.

When the prospective groom's family decide to visit the girl's family with the proposition of marriage, they decide an auspicious day by consulting the birth charts of the boy and girl. Sherpa children are assigned an animal at the time of their birth, and these corresponding animals are also matched when a boy and a girl's birth charts are matched.

It closed on 31 March 2016. History Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced the Office of Religious Freedom as part of his political campaign during the 2011 federal election. A closed-door meeting about the office was criticized when it was discovered that of the six panellists consulted, four were Christian, one Jewish, and one Baha'i. Harper denied the office would have a Christian bias. In response to claims of such a bias at the similar Office of International Religious Freedom in the United States, Harper stated that Canada is \\"a very different country\\". The Office of Religious Freedom was officially opened on 19 February 2013 and Harper announced that Andrew P. W. Bennett, dean of Augustine College and a former civil servant, would be its first Ambassador for Religious Freedom. On 31 March 2016 the Office of Religious Freedom was closed by the newly elected government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Mandate The office's stated mandate was to: #protect, and advocate on behalf of, religious minorities under threat; #oppose religious hatred and intolerance; and #promote Canadian values of pluralism and tolerance abroad. Criticism The Office of Religious Freedom faced some criticism during its proposal and existence. Humanist Canada and the Centre for Inquiry Canada (CFIC) noted that no secular organizations were consulted about the creation of the office, nor were they invited to the official announcement of the new ambassador.4 questions about Canada‚Äôs new Office of Religious Freedom Bob Rae, the then-interim Liberal leader, agreed that religious freedom is an important value but questioned how the office would fit into Canada's broader efforts to address human rights issues.CTV article:Scholar Andrew Bennett to lead Canada's Office of Religious Freedom A representative of the Canadian Council on American-Islamic Relations raised concerns as to whether the office was too Christian focused, since the person appointed to lead it was a Catholic. Endorsement Former British prime minister Tony Blair, a Roman Catholic, warmly endorsed the Office while in Ottawa in October 2013, \\"I think the very fact that Canada's taken the step to have an Office of Religious Freedom is a great sign. I think it shows leadership from Canada. And Canada, by the way, in many ways is a perfect place from which to promote this ideal because of the complexion of the country.\\" Effects Harper stated that Chinese diplomats were upset that he had \\"singled out religious persecution in China\\" during his announcement of the establishment of the office. In a 2013 Globe and Mail article by Steven Chase, Ambassador Bennett was quoted saying, \\"Freedom of religion includes the freedom not to have a particular religious faith ... I think that‚Äôs just logically consistent.\\" The author continued, \\"[Ambassador Bennett] signalled his greatest priority would be believers. ..

History Le Corbusier began experimenting with furniture design in 1928 after inviting the architect, Charlotte Perriand, to join his studio. His cousin, Pierre Jeanneret, also collaborated on many of the designs. Before the arrival of Perriand, Le Corbusier relied on ready-made furniture to furnish his projects, such as the simple pieces manufactured by Thonet, the company that manufactured his designs in the 1930s. Conceptualization In 1928, Le Corbusier and Perriand began to put the expectations for furniture Le Corbusier outlined in his 1925 book L'Art D√©coratif d'aujourd'hui into practice. In the book he defined three different furniture types: type-needs, type-furniture, and human-limb objects. He defined human-limb objects as: \\"Extensions of our limbs and adapted to human functions that are type-needs and type-functions, therefore type-objects and type-furniture. The human-limb object is a docile servant. A good servant is discreet and self-effacing in order to leave his master free. Certainly, works of art are tools, beautiful tools. And long live the good taste manifested by choice, subtlety, proportion, and harmony\\". Products The first results of the collaboration were three chrome-plated tubular steel chairs designed for two of his projects, The Maison la Roche in Paris and a pavilion for Barbara and Henry Church. The line of furniture was expanded for Le Corbusier's 1929 Salon d'Automne installation, 'Equipment for the Home'.

Biography  Verney was born in 1616, was third son of Sir Edmund Verney and his wife, Margaret (died 1641), daughter of Sir Thomas Denton of Hillesden. Edmund was educated at a private school at Gloucester, at Winchester College (1634), and then at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, where he matriculated on 22 January 1636, learnt little and got into debt and into disgrace with his tutor, Henry Wilkinson. Thence he was removed to the care of Mr. Crowther, rector of Newton Blossomville, formerly, his elder brother Ralph's Oxford tutor, who found him \\"devoid of the first grounds of logicke or other University learning\\", but \\"willing and capable\\". Verney entered the army as a volunteer in 1639, joined his father in the army of King Charles I on the Scottish border, and from that time proved himself a first-rate soldier, enduring hardships cheerfully, and winning the confidence of his men. With the first money he earned he paid off his Oxford creditors, and, when the First Bishops' War with Scotland was over, joined the army of the states in Flanders in Sir Thomas Culpepper's company. In winter quarters at Utrecht he studied Latin, French, and history seven or eight hours a day at the university, and did much to repair the time wasted at Oxford. He had many disappointments about promotion, though Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia (sister of Charles I), did her best to help him. In 1640 he served again in the English army against the Scots in the Second Bishops' War. Verney sided with the king in the civil war, and suffered heavily for his loyalty; his pay as well as that of his men was constantly in arrears; the grief of his father's death at the Battle of Edgehill was embittered by the sorrow and indignation he felt that his eldest brother, Ralph, should support the Parliamentary cause; his portion invested in the aulnage was practically forfeited, and he suffered most of all from the mistakes he witnessed daily in the conduct of his own leaders. In 1642 Verney served with James, Duke of Ormonde in Ireland, during the Irish Confederate Wars in the savage fighting against unarmed and untrained peasants. \\"Nobler spirit never was\\", wrote S.R. Gardiner in his History of England, \\"than that of Edmund Verney, a younger son of Charles's knight-marshal, yet even his temper was lowered by the element in which he worked\\". \\"The enemy runs from us wheresoever we meet them\\", he writes, \\"but if we chance to overtake them, we give no quarter, but put all to the sword\\". He sent the same report after the taking of Trim; he saw much fighting, and was wounded at the Battle of Rathconnell. He was knighted in 1644, and made lieutenant-governor of Chester; he served during the two sieges, and was highly valued by Lord Byron and other commanders. After the surrender of Chester, Sir Edmund rejoined Ormonde, to whom he was devotedly attached; and their portraits were painted in Paris by Justus van Egmont in 1648. They returned to Ireland to take part in the last fierce struggle against Cromwell. Sir Edmund had previously been reconciled with his brother. Ormonde committed the command of his own regiment to his friend, when he sent the flower of his army with Sir Arthur Aston to reinforce the defenders of Drogheda. Sir Edmund wrote thence (9 September 1649) earnestly begging Ormonde to fall on the enemy's camp to make a diversion. He survived the horrors of the assault and Cromwell's massacre of the inhabitants, but the few who had escaped were \\"sought out and killed in cold blood\\". Among these was Verney, who was enticed, even from the presence of Cromwell, by a certain Roper, who then \\"ran him thro' with a tuck\\".

It was published by , and is a precursor to the work of Robertson and Seymour linking treewidth to large grid minors, which became an important component of the algorithmic theory of bidimensionality. Definitions and statement A ray, in an infinite graph, is a semi-infinite path: a connected infinite subgraph in which one vertex has degree one and the rest have degree two. defined two rays r0 and r1 to be equivalent if there exists a ray r2 that includes infinitely many vertices from each of them. This is an equivalence relation, and its equivalence classes (sets of mutually equivalent rays) are called the ends of the graph. defined a thick end of a graph to be an end that contains infinitely many rays that are pairwise disjoint from each other. The hexagonal tiling of the plane An example of a graph with a thick end is provided by the hexagonal tiling of the Euclidean plane. Its vertices and edges form an infinite cubic planar graph, which contains many rays. For example, some of its rays form Hamiltonian paths that spiral out from a central starting vertex and cover all the vertices of the graph. One of these spiraling rays can be used as the ray r2 in the definition of equivalence of rays (no matter what rays r0 and r1 are given), showing that every two rays are equivalent and that this graph has a single end. There also exist infinite sets of rays that are all disjoint from each other, for instance the sets of rays that use only two of the six directions that a path can follow within the tiling. Because it has infinitely many pairwise disjoint rays, all equivalent to each other, this graph has a thick end. Halin's theorem states that this example is universal: every graph with a thick end contains as a subgraph either this graph itself, or a graph formed from it by modifying it in simple ways, by subdividing some of its edges into finite paths. The subgraph of this form can be chosen so that its rays belong to the given thick end. Conversely, whenever an infinite graph contains a subdivision of the hexagonal tiling, it must have a thick end, namely the end that contains all of the rays that are subgraphs of this subdivision. Analogues for finite graphs As part of their work on graph minors leading to the Robertson‚ÄìSeymour theorem and the graph structure theorem, Neil Robertson and Paul Seymour proved that a family F of finite graphs has unbounded treewidth if and only if the minors of graphs in F include arbitrarily large square grid graphs, or equivalently subgraphs of the hexagonal tiling formed by intersecting it with arbitrarily large disks. Although the precise relation between treewidth and grid minor size remains elusive, this result became a cornerstone in the theory of bidimensionality, a characterization of certain graph parameters that have particularly efficient fixed-parameter tractable algorithms and polynomial-time approximation schemes. For finite graphs, the treewidth is always one less than the maximum order of a haven, where a haven describes a certain type of strategy for a robber to escape the police in a pursuit-evasion game played on the graph, and the order of the haven gives the number of police needed to catch a robber using this strategy. Thus, the relation between treewidth and grid minors can be restated: in a family of finite graphs, the order of the havens is unbounded if and only if the size of the grid minors is unbounded. For infinite graphs, the equivalence between treewidth and haven order is no longer true, but instead havens are intimately connected to ends: the ends of a graph are in one-to-one correspondence with the havens of order ‚Ñµ0. It is not always true that an infinite graph has a haven of infinite order if and only if it has a grid minor of infinite size, but Halin's theorem provides an extra condition (the thickness of the end corresponding to the haven) under which it becomes true.

Production In 1948, Orson Welles began work on a self-financed film of Othello, which was not completed until 1952. Filming was sporadic, and he frequently stopped the production to take on other acting jobs (including The Third Man) to raise more funds. In 1951, Welles had completed principal photography, but was still trying to raise money to finish editing the film. He was thus delighted to receive an offer from Laurence Olivier, then operating the St James's Theatre, to come and perform Othello on the London stage. Olivier's offer was not met with universal approval. John Gielgud famously asked Welles \\"You're going to do Othello? [pause] On the stage? [longer pause] In London? [total speechlessness]\\"Frank Brady, Citizen Welles (Hodder & Stoughton, London, 1989) p.457 Of the play's design, theatre critic Kenneth Tynan offered the following description: ::\\"Welles the producer gave us a new vista (based on five permanent golden pillars) for every scene; he used a russet traverse-curtain to wipe away the setting in the same manner that the film would use a dissolve; he sprinkled the action with some striking background music and realistic recording - in fact, he sacrificed much to give us a credible reading of a play which bristles with illogicalities. The presentation was visually flawless...the St James's stage seemed as big as a field.\\"Jonathan Rosenbaum (ed.), Orson Welles and Peter Bogdanovich, This is Orson Welles (Da Capo Press, New York, 1992 [re. 1998 ed.]) p.409 Composer Angelo Francesco Lavagnino, had already composed the score for Welles's Othello film, and the director recalled Lavagnino also \\"wrote an entirely different score for Othello when I did it in the theatre.\\"Jonathan Rosenbaum (ed.), Orson Welles and Peter Bogdanovich, This is Orson Welles (Da Capo Press, New York, 1992 [re. 1998 ed.]) p.229 Of Welles's preparations for the play, his biographer Frank Brady writes: ::\\"Stories about Orson's rehearsals quickly became London legends: wielding an enormous long stick from his seat in the front rows to direct and guide his actors where he wanted them to move; disappearing for days before opening night; forgetting his own lines; changing his own entrances from stage left, then stage right, from the back curtains, down stairways, without telling his cast in advance where he would appear, so as to keep them alert; having an enormous picnic hamper prepared at...The Ivy delivered to the theater each day packed with his individual lunch, which consisted of large sherried oysters, p√¢t√© de foie gras, a wheel of Runesten cheese, and other delicacies and always accompanied by a bucket of chilled Pouilly-Fum√© or a Musigny Blanc.\\"Frank Brady, Citizen Welles (Hodder & Stoughton, London, 1989) pp.457-8 The play experienced some problems. On the opening night, Welles mistook his cue, and accidentally walked on to the stage much too early, just after curtain up. Realising his mistake, he froze in front of the audience, exclaimed \\"Fuck!\\", and exited while audience members asked \\"Did he just say what I thought he said?\\" In another performance, Welles so vigorously banged Gudrun Ure's head against a wall during the murder scene that members of the audience protested, and Welles had to apologise after the show, citing having got carried away.Frank Brady, Citizen Welles (Hodder & Stoughton, London, 1989) p.458 Welles found he was hoarse in rehearsals, but regained his voice in time for opening night.Barbara Leaming, Orson Welles (Viking, London, 1985) p.383 The play initially opened for a one-week preview run at the Theatre Royal, Newcastle from 1 to the 7 October 1951, then toured in several regional theatres before opening a six-week run in London on 18 October 1951.Jonathan Rosenbaum (ed.), Orson Welles and Peter Bogdanovich, This is Orson Welles (Da Capo Press, New York, 1992 [re. 1998 ed.]) p.409 One night, Winston Churchill came to watch the play and sat in the front row.

Origins Southern Cross was built at Wivenhoe, Essex, England by Forrest & Sons using funds estimated at ¬£9,000 contributed by Bishop John Richardson Selwyn and others. Originally built as a steam yacht, she underwent conversion to a barquentine rig several years later. Career On her maiden voyage, she was extensively damaged by a storm in the English Channel during October 1891. After repair, she left in early November and arrived in Auckland during March 1892. She was in service with the Melanesian Mission from 1892 to 1902. The engines were removed in 1904 prior to her sale. Final voyage  On 11 September 1920, Southern Cross sailed from Melbourne for Hobart with a general cargo including 1,000 cases of benzine stored on its main deck. On 22 September, a large quantity of wreckage was found on the north coast of King Island. Further searches found wreckage around the island with a concentration at the southern end. As the wreckage bore traces of burning, it was speculated that the ship's deck cargo had caught fire, or that it had struck a mine laid by the German raider Wolff in 1917. The following personnel were reportedly lost in the wrecking - Frank Rule Hodgman, master; T. Watts, mate; C.F. Makepeace, boatswain; D. Dinehy, able seaman; W. O'Connell, able seaman; L. Sward, able seaman; W. Moody, able seaman; Wm. Brown, cook & steward and Stanley Bell, cabin boy.

Main activities and church planting is located in the Southern part of Chin State. For many years the church struggled without help. In the early 2000s, the denomination suffered a split because some pastors questioned the Reformed doctrine of church government, preferring one-man leadership over their churches. About one-third of the congregations withdrew, mostly to Pentecostal Churches. In 2003, a mission partnership was made with the Presbyterian Church of Australia, and shortly after organisation, the denomination grew to 1,800 members; by 2000 the church grew to 2,500 followers; and by 2008, the denomination had about 7,000 members and 40 churches.

It is located 24 km (15 Miles) from Nagercoil, 69 km (43 Miles) from Tirunelveli, and 99 km from Trivandrum International Airport. The nearest port, Tuticorin Port Trust, (also known as V.O.Chidambaram Port), is 111 km from Kavalkinaru. The history of the town can be traced back to the early 17th century (around 1698 A.D), when the region was predominantly ruled by the Pandyan Dynasty. The town, once dependent on agriculture, livestock, stone mining, flower cultivation and the processing of Borassus (Palmyra Tree ‚Äì ‡Æ™‡Æ©‡Øà ‡ÆÆ‡Æ∞‡ÆÆ‡Øç), is now embracing new technologies and professions. The high tunneling- effect of the Western Ghats has enabled this region to be a major Wind Power generation area for India, with thousands of windmills. There are also the test facilities for ISRO Propulsion Complex, a part of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), on the lower slopes of the Mahendragiri mountain near Kavalkinaru. History Kavalkinaru has its roots in the early Dravidian Civilization and its history can be traced from the early 17th century (around 1698 A.D). This region was predominantly ruled by the majestic Pandyan Dynasty; as their kingdom was established from the south of Kaveri River till Kanyakumari. The name originated from the well which provided fresh water for the soldiers of the Cheras, Cholas and Pandiyas Kingdom, which is still preserved in the town. Christianity is the main religion of the people in Kavalkinaru. During the British rule Catholicism slowly started taking its roots by the year (1698 A.D.). Many accepted Christianity as their religion. Around (1749 A.D.) a small Catholic Church was cordially built by the local people to offer their weekly Eucharistic Services. Later in (1843 A.D.) the Sacred Heart Church was built and then it was declared as a separate parish by the Tuticorin Diocese. This was followed by setting up a primary school in 1897; this school helped in educating the children of Kavalkinaru. As days passed, with the dawn of modern education and technological advancements the lifestyle of Kavalkinaru kept increasing and people started practicing several different occupations. Migration As Kavalkinaru is located in the Tropical region, it received very scanty rainfalls every year. During the early 20th century till the later years of that period, the entire region was badly pushed into severe droughts. This severely affected the annual yield, they wondered with answers for better life. They struggled to meet their day-to-day needs; but remained very gritty and did not gave-up to any such disaster. They suffered a lot and were challenged by a better tomorrow for their children. Keeping themselves rooted strong; the people started migrating to different parts of the world. They started taking refuge into different regions of India and abroad. Many of them went in search for jobs in Chennai (then called as Madras), Madurai, Coimbatore, Mumbai, Delhi,Goa, Dubai, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Singapore, and elsewhere. They struggled for their existence in the new places, wherever they went. They were faced with varied problems like language difference, cultural difference, shelter problems, and mainly vocational issues. Many started small businesses and worked as laborers in mills, small companies, printing-press; they also started grocery shops, tailored dresses, accounted Banks, taught at schools and learnt handy skills to fulfill their daily needs. They faced them all, with decisive will. By this way they steadily crafted their future and enriched their lives. In middle of this great effort, they made-sure that they meet during the Church Feast every year. During this time, they started rebuilding their Native, by constructing high-end tanks for water supply and drilled wells for cultivation. Thus agricultural growth showed up, the farmers were pleased by the rise of crops. From then the people enjoyed the surplus yields. Later they also built public libraries, chapels and good roads for proper transportation, which facilitated trade in Kavalkinaru. In the other end, children were too getting educated, and were getting empowered to take-up the task. Kavalkinaru slowly climbed the ladder of prosperity. The growth factor got reflected in the lifestyle of the people; they started building beautiful houses and lawns, and made Kavalkinaru look a paradise in itself. Today when people visit back Kavalkinaru they are usually reminded about the famous Tamil song ‡Æö‡Øä‡Æ±‡Øç‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡ØÜ ‡Æé‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ±‡Æ≤‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡ÆÖ‡Æ§‡ØÅ ‡Æ®‡ÆÆ‡Øç‡ÆÆ‡ØÇ‡Æ∞‡ØÅ ‡Æ™‡Øä‡Æ≤ ‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Ææ! from the Tamil Movie Ooru Vittu Ooru Vanthu. The growth of Kavalkinaru came in as a big surprise to many of the neighboring towns and villages; they were stunned at the complete turnaround of Kavalkinaru. Slowly they also followed into the steps of Kavalkinaru. The other important neighboring landmarks of Kavalkinaru are both Vadakkankulam and Kudankulam. Kavalkinaru churches 1\\\\. R.C Church 2\\\\. St. Antony's Church 3\\\\. Annai Velankanni Church 4\\\\. ICA (WMM) Pentecostal Church 5\\\\. C.S.I Church Sacred Heart Church In midst of all this, people didn't forget their very own church. As the church structure was too getting old, they decided to rebuild a massive structure in place of the old structure. So on 1932, the foundation was laid to construct a majestic church. Therefore, by 1961, a new construction was built and raised, in the very classical Gothic Architecture style. The church's architecture style became a unique feature of architecture in the entire region of Tirunelveli. Later, the church proved to be an imposing building with inspiring architecture to the Catholics around this region. The environment around the church was also set to be spic and span, radiating rays of hope and piety. Finally the church was blessed and incarnated for the first time on 9 June 1961 to the people of Kavalkinaru. Kavalkinaru has many other churches within its boundaries; there is a St. Anthony Church near the Sacred Heart Church; the Our Lady of Fatima Church at Kavalkinaru Junction and an Annai Velankanni chapel to the east of Kavalkinaru Junction, this chapel has a huge Meditation Center where Masses are conducted on special days and a small chapel of St. Michael (archangel) is also built inside Kavalkinaru. There is a C.S.I. Church of South India church, and many small Hindu temples of various deities are instilled in various corners of Kavalkinaru. There is also an Ayyavazhi Temple in Kavalkinaru. Annual feast Every year the annual church festival is celebrated with all pomp and gaiety. The people of Kavalkinaru from all around the world make a compulsory attend, to celebrate the annual feast in the month of May. People come here during this festive season in the mood of nostalgia in receiving their lifelong friends and relatives who had been far-away for several years. It becomes an occasion for renewing their old ties and attitude toward each other. Gone are the days when they eagerly waited for each other in solitude. Their hearts are no more vacant now. The darkness in their hearts is replaced by love and affection. There is no place for idle illusions, as the manifestation of love is seen everywhere. The feast attracts people from all faiths who pray to Jesus for thanksgiving or requesting of favors. The church feast is annually celebrated on 15 May with Flag Hoisting and there is a Car- Procession on the 9th Day of the celebration. On the 11th day there is a Common Meal served at the church with the congregation of all the people and to bid their final prayers. During the Fair, the entire area is decorated with festoons and buntings, the church is decorated with electric lights, portraying the majestic view of the grand church. Many pitch up stalls selling sweets, cosmetic items and toys. Many entertainment fixtures like Giant Wheel & Carousel (Merry-Go-Round) are set for entertainment during the feast days, people from all ages enjoy this season with full sensation and make it a memorable moment in their lives. Kavalkinaru Junction Kavalkinaru Junction adds to Kavakinaru's growth in many ways. National Highway 7, which connects Varanasi and Kanyakumari, bypasses through the center of this junction, making it a trade point in the entire region. Almost all basic facilities can be availed from the junction. It is the main stop for almost all the buses running through it. There is a vegetable market, 'Kamaraj Market', situated besides the Junction, which attracts traders from all the regions of Tamil Nadu, making it a prime hub for trade and distribution to the Tirunelveli district and vegetables are loaded to adjacent states of Kerala. Because of growing trade and revenue, banks have set up their branches in Kavalkinaru. There are other businesses like transportation, hotels, bakery, lodges, agencies, Internet cafe and many quick stalls have come up near the junction. Moreover, there is a modern flower market with state-of-the-art facilities such as cold storage facility and electronic auctioning system on 7.40-acre poramboke land at an estimated cost of Rs. 10 crore, for which then Minister for Local Administration M.K. Stalin laid the foundation stone on 10 May 2008. The market has an office with Internet and electronic display board to display daily rates of flowers, agriculture support centre to render technical assistance to farmers and sell agriculture inputs to them, garland-making units of self-help groups, toilets, dormitory, etc. But still this market is not fully operational due to various reasons. Other landmarks As Kavalkinaru is set in the high tunneling-effect region in the Western Ghats it has enabled this entire region to be a huge Wind Power generation region in India. Hence, there are thousands of Windmills deployed in this region to generate safe energy. The Central Government of India has constructed the test facilities for ISRO Propulsion Complex, a part of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), on the lower slopes of the Mahendragiri mountain near Kavalkinaru. Kavalkinaru has a well constructed Railway Station (now defunct) where the Chennai-Kanyakumari line runs on; passenger trains used to stop at Kavalkinaru Railway Station in its early days. There are two ponds in Kavalkinaru both the ponds usually are full during the Monsoon, these ponds are not used for drinking water but they are used for irrigation and cleaning the Cattle. Many marriage halls are also built in and around Kavalkinaru as many household functions/parties are frequently organized in a big way. Dr. S. A. Raja the Founder Chairman of the Rajas Group of Institutions had built 'Rajas Dental College' in the heart of this junction; hence hostel facilities are present in this junction for students coming from nearby states of Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Kavalkinaru Junction is a main shopping location which contains Landmark shops RAJAS mall, JOJO travels, Italian Bakery, Jaison Bakery and Rich fancy etc. Kavalkinaru today Today Kavalkinaru has crossed many leaps and bounds, in development and prosperity. The younger generations of Kavalkinaru are simply doing a remarkable work in pursuing professional courses such as Engineering, Oil Rig Drilling Technology, Oil Platform Technicians, Computer Technology, Medical Sciences, Nursing Science, Mechanical Engineering, Telecommunication Engineering, Aeronautics, Agriculture, Business Administration, Law, etc. In addition, Kavalkinaru is quite famous for its dominance in Volleyball in the Tirunelveli district. Today the Panchayat of Kavalkinaru is the biggest one, when compared with the other adjacent areas. Kavalkinaru enclaves four hamlets under its Panchayat and treat them equally. There are one high school and six middle schools and many colleges. Kavalkinaru Post-Office is attributed as the Main Post Office with Postal Code as 627105. The people of Kavalkinaru have great admiration for the legendary Indian National Congress leader and the former chief minister of Tamil Nadu Bharat Ratna K. Kamaraj, and hence they have unveiled his two statues, one in the centre of their landscape and the other statue at Kavalkinaru Junction. The growth of the village is also supported by local leaders like M. Appavu, who once taught in the schools of Kavalkinaru. The other M.L.A of this region is S. Michael Rayappan a film producer by producing films like \\"Naadodigal\\", \\"Goripalayam\\" and \\"Sindhusamaveli\\" under Global Infotainments banner. Tamil movie Kovil (film) was also shot in Kavalkinaru and in its Sacred Heart Church.

It is adjacent to the Transbay Transit Center site and located on the same block as 100 First Plaza, 555 Mission Street, and 101 Second Street. History In 1984, a partnership called Bredero-Northern filed an application for a tall, 23-story office building. The Environmental Impact Report was certified in 1986, but the project was subsequently withdrawn by the developers and never built. In 1999, a new sponsor called DWI Development, Inc. proposed a 22-story, approximately tall building, which was approved in April 2000. Following the dot-com crash, Hines Interests Limited Partnership took over the project and in 2002 demolished the existing structures and built a temporary parking lot until the economy recovered. With the office market slow to recover, the site was sold in 2003 to Monahan Pacific for $19.2 million, with plans to switch the development to condominiums. In 2005, the site was approved for a 35-story, tall building containing up to 273 housing units. However, by 2006, citing an \\"overheated\\" residential real estate market, Monahan Pacific sold the development site to Beacon Capital Partners for $30 million, who changed the plans back to offices. Beacon broke ground on 535 Mission during the summer of 2008, driving piles and laying the building's foundation. In October, with the onset of the 2008 financial crisis, construction on the building was halted. After lying dormant for four years, the site was sold along with already purchased construction materials to Boston Properties for $71 million. Boston Properties restarted construction in 2013. Topping-out ceremonies were held on January 8, 2014 and the building opened in November 2014. The building was planned to attain LEED Gold status upon completion. As of 2014, one third of the space was occupied by Trulia, a real estate website company.

Plot Krazy, as the cartoon's title implies, is a mouse exterminator, and in his office. He immediately receives a phone call about a rodent problem. The cat arrives at the home of his caller. Unable to grasp the mouse out of the hole in the wall, Krazy decides to attract the mouse out using a wind-up toy looking like a girl mouse. Although he successfully lured the little nuisance out and even got his paws on it, the mouse is able to return to its lair. Krazy then resorts to using a rifle and starts firing at the hole. The mouse then shows up in front of Krazy, claiming to be powerless, and seemingly asks for mercy. Krazy falls for the pretense and starts to feel guilty. When the two shake hands, the mouse pulls Krazy into the hole until the cat's head is crammed in. The mouse begins pummeling Krazy's face like a speed bag. When Krazy returns to firing his rifle at the hole, the mouse repeats the same trick before pounding the cat with a mallet. Having enough of the mouse's trickery, Krazy takes a vacuum cleaner to pull in his prey. As the mouse gets sucked in the cleaner, Krazy believes he solved the problem as calls the homeowner. But the mouse comes out of the vacuum bag and is determined to get back at Krazy. The mouse switches on the vacuum near an unsuspecting Krazy who then gets sucked in with only his head sticking out.

It is distributed by Bharat Shah's VIP films banner. The film is based on the 2009 short story \\"The Railway Aunty\\" by Mohan Sikka. The movie was earlier scheduled to be released on 12 July 2013 but was eventually released on 2 August 2013. The date was postponed because of a major release, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, on 12 July 2013. Upon release, the movie received universal critical acclaim. Plot The story begins with the death of the parents of Mukesh, a teenager who has just graduated from senior high school. Mukesh is put into the care of an unfriendly aunt. He struggles to get along with his aunt's family who refuses to provide him with any money. As he struggles to study in the first year of his BA, he also worries for his two sisters who have been sent to live in an orphanage for girls. Mukesh bonds with an undertaker named Johnny over their mutual love of chess. Johnny has a brother in Mauritius who has invited him to live there, but Johnny has no money to get to Mauritius. He tells Mukesh of his dream to leave the country one day. One day Mukesh is introduced to a cougar named Sarika, a woman much older than him, at a kitty party in his aunt's place. He happens to go to Sarika's home to get apples, only to be seduced by Sarika. She pays him for his services as a gigolo and the two routinely have sex. Sarika introduces Mukesh to many older women who finally make him a male prostitute. On one occasion Sarika and Mukesh are caught having sex by her husband. He complains to Mukesh's aunt that Mukesh had been seeking a loan from Sarika, and tried to kiss her. This makes Mukesh's aunt throw him out of the house. Mukesh comes to Johnny's house and stays with him. Sarika refuses to stay in touch with him, and makes sure that none of her female friends who were Mukesh's clients entertain him. Frustrated, Mukesh asks Johnny to visit Sarika and ask for the money she owes him. Johnny returns to say that she refused to do so and threatened to call the police. Meanwhile, Mukesh's sisters are having a hard time at the orphanage. Out of desperation, Mukesh decides to offer his sexual services to men. In the process, he is raped and beaten up by a gang. Feeling betrayed by Sarika and holding her responsible for his misery, Mukesh barges into her home and demands the money that is due to him. Sarika says she gave the money to Johnny, but Mukesh refuses to believe her. Sarika's husband, Ashok, arrives suddenly, and to prove her innocence Sarika makes an unsuspecting Mukesh stab her lightly to make it look like he attacked her. In a state of shock, Mukesh stabs her three more times till she dies, in front of Ashok. Mukesh then runs away to Johnny's house. Shortly, he receives a call from his sisters who have run away from the orphanage, and need his help. Mukesh realises that Sarika told the truth, and Johnny has packed up and left the country with his money. He receives another call from his sisters to pick them up at the railway station. Mukesh tells them to wait till he arrives. On his way, he is seen by the police who chase him to the top of a building's balcony. As the police point a gun at him, he gets yet another call from his sisters. Mukesh while trapped, commits suicide by jumping off the balcony and dies on the spot.

Petersville is located at the junction of Maryland routes 79 and 180, northeast of Rosemont. History The village of Petersville has a long and prominent heritage in the history of Frederick County and the State of Maryland. Located along a main east-west route which became the Harpers Ferry and Frederick Turnpike (later MD Route 180), Petersville grew as a stop along the turnpike with businesses to serve travelers as well as local farmers. The land on which Petersville is situated was originally patented by Captain John Colvill as the \\"Merryland Tract\\" on November 5, 1731, containing over 6,000 acres. Shortly after the Revolutionary War, Petersville began to develop as a village, with lots facing the turnpike route and four cross streets. The village also sat at the crossroads of one of the valley's north- south roads leading from Middletown to Berlin (today Brunswick). The 1808 Varle Map of Maryland shows Petersville. Five years later, in October 1813, the Petersville Post Office was established (it closed in 1909). The Maryland General Assembly established the Petersville District in 1829. =Historic Sites= * Barleywood - The farm house at Barleywood, constructed of logs, was erected around 1800. The historic farm was the site of a female school operated in the 1830s by Rev. R.H. Phillips under the auspices of St. Mark's Episcopal Parish. * Howard Marvin Jones House - Built between 1914 and 1920, the Howard Marvin Jones House is an example of Colonial Revival Style constructed in an American Foursquare plan. * Levin West House - The Wests were among the earliest families to settle in Petersville. The Levin West House, constructed of stone in the Federal style with later brick additions, was completed circa 1815. The grandson of the builder, Dr. Levin West, operated his medical practice in the house in the late 19th century. * Methodist Episcopal Church/Faith Reformed Church - Governor Francis Thomas, who lived at Montevue, just south of Petersville, erected a two-story stone \\"town hall\\" for Petersville around 1850. The structure became the Methodist Episcopal Church of Petersville shortly before the Civil War and served that congregation until the 1890s. In 1900, the building was renamed Faith Reformed Church and operated as such until 1938, at which time it was converted to a residence. St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Petersville * Mount O'Donnell - Originally named \\"Montevue,\\" Mount O'Donnell was built in 1819 by Col. John Thomas, father of Francis Thomas, Governor of Maryland from 1842-1845. During the Maryland Campaign of 1862, Mount O'Donnell was used as a headquarters for Union offices while troops were encamped at Petersville. The home was sold by Governor Thomas in 1861 to General Columbus O'Donnell, at which time the name changed to Mount O'Donnell. The house is constructed of brick and is built in Federal style. * Oakland - The land on which Oakland is situated was originally part of a large tract called \\"Hawkin's Merry Peep-O-Day,\\" patented in 1753. The first house on the farm, described as a stone dwelling, was constructed by Dr. Grafton Duvall in the 1840s. The present Greek Revival styled house was erected in the 1850s by Horatio Claggett. The home remained in the Claggett Family well into the twentieth century. * Petersville Luther Chapel - Lutheran services were started in Petersville by ministers from St. Paul's Lutheran Church in nearby Burkittsville as early as 1870. The congregation was organized on October 28, 1873, by which time work had already commenced on erecting a church. Petersville Luther Chapel was dedicated in 1874 and was constructed of brick and covered in stucco at a cost of $1,850.00. St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Petersville * St. Mark's Episcopal Church - St. Mark's Parish was established in 1789 when the lower portion of the Middletown and Pleasant Valleys were separated from All Saints Parish. The parish church was placed in Petersville and the first vestry was elected in 1800. A frame or log church was erected on the site in 1807 and consecrated in 1819 by Bishop James Kemp. This church was replaced in 1830 with a brick structure which was consecrated in 1831 by Bishop William Stone. Under the pastorate of Rev. Edward Trail Helfenstein (later Bishop of the Diocese of Maryland), the parish expanded to encompass four churches (St. Mark's - Petersville; St. Luke's - Brownsville; St. John's - Burkittsville; and Grace - Brunswick). Rev. Helfenstein also led in the construction of the present St. Mark's Church, which was completed in 1891. The brick church displays both Gothic Revival and Romanesque style characteristics. St. Mark's Church closed in the mid-1960s and is used by an Apostolic congregation today. The surrounding churchyard contains several historic graves including Governor Francis Thomas, who lived near the church at \\"Montevue.\\" * St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church - St. Mary's Church was founded in the early 1820s, supported by a bequest from Maryland's second governor, Thomas Sim Lee, who lived nearby on the Needwood Estate. The brick church was constructed in 1845 by enslaved men and women from the Needwood Plantation, replacing an earlier log structure. The unique configuration of the church with the portico over the entrance and the bell tower at the back of the building may have been based on the second St. John the Evangelist Church in nearby Frederick. In 2016, the portico was restored with new Doric columns replacing mid-20th-century cement block piers. St. Mary's Church was the site of a parochial school for African American children, and a large part of its congregation has been historically black. St. Francis of Assissi Church in Brunswick was founded from St. Mary's in the 1890s.

It is sometimes referred to as Flemish Dutch (), Belgian Dutch ( ), or Southern Dutch (). Flemish is native to Flanders, a historical region in northern Belgium, by Flemings, the dominant ethnic group of the region.Leidraad van de Taaltelefoon. Dienst Taaladvies van de Vlaamse Overheid (Department for Language advice of the Flemish government). Outside of Flanders, it is also spoken to some extent in French Flanders and the Dutch Zeelandic Flanders. The term Flemish itself has become ambiguous. Nowadays, it is used in at least five ways, depending on the context. These include: # An indication of Dutch written and spoken in Flanders including the Dutch standard language as well as the non-standardized dialects, including intermediate forms between vernacular dialects and the standard. Some linguists avoid the term Flemish in this context and prefer the designation Belgian-Dutch or South-Dutch # A synonym for the so-called intermediate language in Flanders region, the # An indication of the non-standardized dialects and regiolects of Flanders region # An indication of the non- standardized dialects of only the former County of Flanders, ie the current provinces of West Flanders and East Flanders, Zeelandic Flanders and Frans- Vlaanderen # An indication of the non-standardized West Flemish dialects of the province of West Flanders, the Dutch Zeelandic Flanders and French MultiTree considers Flemish to include the four principal Dutch dialects in the Flemish region (Flanders): Brabantian, East Flemish, West Flemish and Limburgish as well as three other dialects. Glottolog considers Flemish to be a separate (regional) language, which includes the dialects French Flemish and West Flemish. Ethnologue considers Limburgish and West Flemish to be separate (regional) languages.Their ISO 639-3 codes are vls and lim, respectively.  Characteristics  Map showing the historical dialects spoken in the Low Countries, this map does not portray dialect zones of the modern Dutch language family, wherein Dutch and Flemish are distinct varieties of Dutch. Dutch is the majority language in northern Belgium, being used in written language by three-fifths of the population of Belgium. It is one of the three national languages of Belgium, together with French and German, and is the only official language of the Flemish Region. The various Dutch dialects spoken in Belgium contain a number of lexical and a good amount of grammatical features that distinguish them from the standard Dutch. Basic Dutch words can have a completely different meaning in Flemish or imply different context., 155 ff. As in the Netherlands, the pronunciation of Standard Dutch is affected by the native dialect of the speaker. All Dutch dialect groups spoken in Belgium are spoken in adjacent areas of the Netherlands as well. East Flemish forms a continuum with both Brabantic and West Flemish. Standard Dutch is primarily based on the Hollandic dialect (spoken in the Western provinces of the Netherlands) and to a lesser extent on Brabantian, which is the dominant dialect in Flanders, as well as in the south of the Netherlands. =Tussentaal= The supra-regional, semi-standardized colloquial form (mesolect) of Dutch spoken in Belgium uses the vocabulary and the sound inventory of the Brabantic dialects. It is often called an \\"in-between- language\\" or \\"intermediate language,\\" intermediate between dialects and standard Dutch. Despite its name, Brabantian is the dominant contributor to the Flemish Dutch tussentaal. It is a rather informal variety of speech, which occupies an intermediate position between vernacular dialects and the standard language. It incorporates phonetic, lexical and grammatical elements not part of the standard language but drawn from local dialects. It is a relatively new phenomenon that has been gaining popularity during the past decades. Some linguists note that it seems to be undergoing a process of (limited) standardisation, 196. or that it is evolving into a koin√© variety.Rys, K. & J. Taeldeman (2007). Fonologische ingredi√´nten van Vlaamse tussentaal. In: D. Sandra, R. Rymenans, P. Cuvelier et al. (red.), Tussen taal, spelling en onderwijs. Essays bij het emeritaat van Frans Daems. Gent: Academia Press, 1-9, p.2. Tussentaal is slowly gaining popularity in Flanders because it is used a lot in television dramas and comedies. Often, middle-class characters in a television series will be speaking tussentaal, lower-class characters use the dialect of the location where the show is set(West Flemish,...), and upper-class characters will speak Flemish. That has given tussentaal the status of normalcy in Flanders. It is slowly being accepted by the general population, but it has met with objections from writers and academics who argue that it dilutes the usage of Standard Dutch. Tussentaal is used in entertainment television but rarely in informative programmes (like the news), which normally use Flemish accents with standard Dutch vocabulairy. Etymology The English adjective Flemish (first attested as , ; compare , ), meaning \\"from Flanders\\", was probably borrowed from Old Frisian. which cites as an Old Frisian form; but compare The Old Dutch form is , which becomes , in Middle Dutch and in Modern Dutch. The word itself is derived from ,Vloanderngouwe an Ingaevones word, from the Germanic (a cognate to the English flow and the Old German word ), which means 'flow or current'. The name was formed from a stem , with a suffix -√∞r- attached.

He won five of his seven races, including the Port Stakes in 1825, but his appearances were limited by leg problems. Throughout his racing career he was owned by Charles Wyndham. After retiring from racing Camel became a successful stallion, siring St. Leger winners Touchstone and Launcelot and becoming British Champion sire in 1838. Background Camel was a brown colt bred by George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, and foaled in 1822. He was sired by Whalebone, who won the Newmarket Stakes and Epsom Derby in 1834. After retiring from racing he was a successful stallion, becoming Champion sire twice. Amongst his other progeny were Derby winners Lap-dog and Spaniel, as well as the top sire Sir Hercules. Camel's dam was an unnamed daughter of Selim. Camel was owned by Egremont's son Charles Wyndham. Racing career Camel was due to race the colt Peter Proteus in a match race at Newmarket on 21 April 1825, but Peter Proteus paid a forfeit and was withdrawn. They following day he contested the Newmarket Stakes, facing eight rivals. Cramer was the pre-race favourite at 6/4, with Camel second favourite at 3/1. The race was won by 17/1 outsider Crockery, with Camel finishing second. On 3 May he started as the 5/4 favourite for a ¬£50 race for three-year-olds over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. Ridden by W. Arnull, Camel won the race from Adeliza. At Newmarket's Second October meeting he beat Dahlia, Mortgage and 1000 Guineas winner Tontine in a race for one-third of a subscription of 25 sovereigns each. At the beginning of November he beat Tarandus in a match race over five and a half furlongs at Newmarket. Two days later Camel lost a match against the filly Scandel. Camel only raced once in 1826, when he started as the 7/4 favourite for the Port Stakes at Newmarket. Ridden as usual by Arnull, he won the race from Redgauntlet, with Lionel Lincoln finishing in third place. Two others finished behind Lionel Lincoln, but were not placed by the judge. He was scheduled to run in the Garden Stakes in October, but was withdrawn from the race, which was won by Bizarre. He raced only once again in 1827, after suffering with leg problems since his win in the Port Stakes. This was at Newmarket in October, where he beat Redgauntlet easily by two lengths over one mile. Stud career Camel initially stood as a stallion at Earl Grosvenor's Eaton Stud near Chester. In 1830 he stood for a fee of ten guineas and half a guinea for the groom. He became a successful stallion and was the leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1838. His most important progeny were: * Touchstone (1831) - won the St. Leger in 1834. He sired many classic winners, including Cotherstone, Orlando, Surplice and Newminster. * Caravan (1834) - won the Ascot Gold Cup. * Prism (1836) - foaled The Oaks winner Refraction. * Black Bess (1837) - was the dam of 2000 Guineas winner Hernandez. * Launcelot (1837) - won the St. Leger in 1840. * Fiammetta (1838) - won the Poule d'Essai. * Misdeal (1839) - won the St. James's Palace Stakes.

Early life Born in Laguna Beach, California, Reign grew up near the beach in Orange County, south of Los Angeles. In high school, she did Model United Nations program and was cast in the third season of the MTV reality television series Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County. Reign enrolled at Santa Monica College and in 2010 she transferred to UCLA. She graduated from UCLA with a degree in gender studies in 2014. Lecturer Jen Moorman said that Reign was a \\"thoughtful and inquisitive student who brought a unique perspective to the classroom.\\" Career A former Hooters Girl, she began her career as a professional stripper in 2008, dancing at a club called the Silver Reign, from which she took her pseudonym. =Modeling= While enrolled as a student at UCLA, Reign was selected by Playboy magazine for its 2010 \\"Girls of the Pac-10\\" issue, as well as the magazine's \\"Cyber Girl of the Week\\". She appeared as a centerfold model in the April 2011 issue of Penthouse and the following month she was the Penthouse Pet of the Month. In February 2013 she appeared on the cover of OC Weekly. Additional magazines Reign covered include Club, Xtreme and Hot Vid√©o. =Adult industry= Reign filmed her first adult movie in 2010 at the age of 21, a girl-girl scene for the production company Lethal Hardcore. Her adult movie highlights include filming superhero porn in Japan, starring in New Sensations' Anchorman: A XXX Parody, and appearing on the covers of many adult releases, including Zero Tolerance Entertainment's Kittens & Cougars 5 and Knockers Out, as well as Pleasure Dynasty's Zorro XXX: A Pleasure Dynasty Parody. The 2012 XBIZ Awards enlisted Reign for the position of \\"Trophy Girl\\", along with fellow adult star Bibi Jones. Also in 2012, Reign launched her official membership site, www.TashaReign.com. Reign also appeared on the cover along with an interview and photo spread in France's Hot Video adult industry trade magazine and was their red carpet correspondent conducting interviews at the 28th annual XRCO Awards. In order to create \\"fun, sex-positive adult content\\", Reign launched her own adult production studio in the fall of 2012 ‚Äì Reign Productions, for which she also writes and directs most of her material. The studio's first DVD, Tasha Reign Is Sexy, was released on Halloween 2012. In July 2013, the studio signed a distribution deal with Girlfriends Films. Introduced in 2014, Reign also has a line of adult novelty products which are manufactured by Crystal Delights. =Writing= In March 2012, indie rock magazine and website Rock Confidential brought Reign on as a weekly music reviewer, dubbed \\"The World's Hottest Music Critic\\". Reign announced the position while a guest on musician Dave Navarro's radio show, Dark Matter, citing her background in music appreciation courses at UCLA. In April 2013, the alternative paper OC Weekly announced Reign as its newest weekly columnist, penning \\"Tasha Tells All...\\". The first article was a commentary on Los Angeles County's Measure B. In February 2014, she became an online columnist for The Huffington Post. =Advocacy= In February 2014, amidst the controversy created by the revelation that a Duke University student was also an adult film actress and was using her earnings to pay for her tuition, Reign reached out via her blog in The Huffington Post to offer her support to the harassed student. She said in her posting, \\"In an ideal world, you would be able to openly and fearlessly state your stage name, or even your birth name; however, it seems you are not as lucky as me to have gone to a school which celebrates your diversity and sexuality... I want to apologize for all the ignorant, fearful comments your schoolmates at Duke are unloading on you... Your peers have degraded you, misrepresented you, judged you, and made you feel unwelcome at an institution at which you seek a higher education.\\" Reign's comments were in response to an interview with the student (later identified as actress Belle Knox) in the Duke University newspaper and a posting on the website XOJane.com. Reign is against unlicensed distribution of videos and sometimes personally searches the Internet for illegally posted clips or movies that feature her work. She was featured in an April 2014 broadcast of the ABC News Nightline story about copyright infringement in the adult industry. In late 2016, she is active in advocacy to oppose the passing of California's \\"Proposition 60\\", which would introduce a law that sex performers must always use condoms in sex scenes.https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/18/porn-tasha-reign- california-condom-law-proposition-60 Appearances British filmmaker Louis Theroux's documentary Twilight of the Porn Stars for the BBC features Reign, who told the UK tabloid newspaper Sunday Sport that the documentary unfairly paints a negative picture of an industry she loves very much. Reign is a recurring co-host for KXRN-LP in Laguna Beach. In , she appeared in the independent film Blood of Redemption. In February 2014, Reign spoke on a panel with fellow actress Jessica Drake during the University of Chicago's Sex Week where they were featured on a panel entitled From Porn to Sex Ed. Again in February, Reign along with Jessica Drake spoke on a panel titled Porn, Prostitution, and Censorship: The Politics of Empowerment at Moore Hall at University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). The annual panel is sponsored by the Social Awareness Network for Activism through Art (SANAA) in honor of Eve Ensler's V-Day organization. Reign and Drake were joined by Ph.D. candidate in Cinema and Media Studies at UCLA and lecturer at Otis College of Art and Design Jennifer Moorman and UCLA Distinguished Lecturer Dr. Christopher Mott who leads a seminar titled \\"Pornography and the Politics of Sexual Representation\\". During the panel, Reign was quoted as saying about the industry and its treatment of women, \\"As a performer, I have never felt objectified; I feel empowered and I've always looked at myself as a whole person and sexuality is only one of my characteristics. What people tend to forget is that women performers are the highest wage earners, so that's a complete reversal of Hollywood... Because women's bodies are objectified, they make a hell of a lot more money than the men do.\\" In Septmenber 2019 Reign appeared on the first episode of the sixth season of This is Life with Lisa Ling on CNN titled Porn Ed. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11011270/?ref_=ttep_ep1  Personal life  During a May 2012 holiday in Monaco with fellow adult star Brooklyn Lee, Reign encountered former United States President Bill Clinton. A photo of the adult stars and Clinton quickly went viral on the internet. After massive media attention, Reign explained the photo with Clinton was her being a fan of him and not the other way around.

It is an oxide with the general chemical formula (Ta,Nb,Sn,Mn,Fe)4O8 or (Ta,Mn,Nb)O2. Structure Ixiolite was originally reported as crystallizing in the monoclinic crystal system. Detailed studies of the scandium, tin and titanium rich varieties indicate that they form crystals in the orthorhombic system whereas tungsten ixiolite is monoclinic. Discovery and occurrence It was first described in 1857 for an occurrence at Skogsb√∂le, Kimito Island, Finland. The name is for Ixion, the Greek mythological character related to Tantalus, as the mineral contains tantalum. Ixiolite is typically associated with feldspar, tapiolite, cassiterite, microlite, and rutile. Substitution and varieties Trace elements include zirconium, hafnium, titanium and tungsten. As with other tantallum and niobium bearing minerals considerable substitution and a number of varieties exist. Substitutions in the formula are common and the varieties stannian ixiolite (tin), titanian ixiolite (titanium) and wolframian ixiolite (tungsten) have been reported. Scandium is present in many ixiolite sample with percentages up to 4.0 percent Sc2O3, but usually less than one percent scandium oxide. High scandium ixiolites, containing from 4 to 19% scandium oxide are typically also rich in tin and titanium. Economic importance Ixiolite together with microlite, tantalite, tapiolite, wodginite are the most important minerals mined for the element tantalum. Ixiolite contains about 69 % tantalum oxide (Ta2O5) and is a common constituent of coltan ore.

He founded Indigo Digital Press in 1977 and The Landa Group in 2003. In the print production industry, Landa has been called the \\"father of commercial digital printing.\\"Prophet of print: Benny Landa hopes to strike nano-goldBenny Landa's invisible ink. YNet  Biography Ben Zion (Benny) Landa was born in Poland. When he was two years old, his family emigrated from Europe to Edmonton, Alberta. While in Canada, Landa‚Äôs father devised a new camera using bicycle parts and pulleys that captured images directly onto photographic paper, avoiding the need for film. Landa studied physics and engineering at the Technion in Israel and psychology and literature at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He later graduated from the London Film School.  Business career  In 1969, Landa began his professional career at CAPS, a micrographics research company. He helped develop a new micrographic product that earned the company a major contract with Rolls-Royce Aero Engine Division and led to Landa‚Äôs appointment as head of Research and Development. In 1971, Benny Landa and a colleague co-founded Imtec, an international micrographics company. Landa invented the company‚Äôs core imaging technology. While researching liquid toners, he developed a method of high-speed image development which used charged pigmented particles in a liquid carrier. Landa immigrated to Israel in 1974. Applying the filmless imaging concept developed by his father, Landa founded Indigo Digital Printing in 1977. In 1993 at IPEX, he introduced the E-Print 1000, a digital color printing press. Bypassing the printing plate setup process, the new process eliminated numerous costly and time-consuming steps associated with offset printing. It enabled printing from a computer file directly onto paper and launched short-run, on-demand, and variable data printing into the marketplace. The Indigo digital press uses an electric charge to apply small color particles (in liquid form known as ElectroInk), thereby creating a thin, smooth, plastic layer on the substrate. By the 1990s, Indigo became a significant alternative to traditional offset press manufacturers. In 2002, Landa sold Indigo Digital Printing to Hewlett-Packard for US$830 million. Following the acquisition of Indigo, Landa established The Landa Group for nanotechnology research. Working with nanoparticles, Landa and his team sought to capture environmental heat from the surrounding air and convert it into electricity. Landa‚Äôs research group observed that many materials exhibit unusual properties at the nano-level. They used that discovery to experiment with pigment colorants for print production. Benny Landa presenting his Nanographic Printing technology at Drupa 2012 Landa created Landa Digital Printing to further commercialize the nanotechnology solution for printing. The group developed a printing ink using the nanopigments, which they named Landa NanoInk, along with a digital printing process which they called Nanography. This process uses inkjet heads that place the process colours of ink onto a belt, which in turn deposits the resulting image onto paper. Landa introduced Nanography and a line of Nanographic Printing presses at Drupa in 2012. The new nanography technology enables high-speed digital printing with B1 (41 in. / 1,050 mm) format media on all forms of substrates, including untreated paper, films, or plastic. The goal is to allow printers to produce short-to-medium run lengths. The long- term cost effectiveness of the process is still to be determined, since no live production presses have yet been producing sellable work over extended time frames.  Philanthropy  In 2002, Landa and his wife Patsy established the Landa Fund for Equal Opportunity Through Education which has donated more than $50 million in university scholarships. The Landa Fund also supports non- profit organizations in the fields of education and promoting tolerance and understanding between Israel‚Äôs Jewish and Arab citizens.

He is one of the original members of Gucci Mane's 1017 Records and Waka Flocka Flame's Brick Squad Monopoly. Frenchie is credited for introducing fellow East Coast rappers Nicki Minaj and French Montana to Debra's Mizay Entertainment before their mainstream breakouts. He released French Connection in 2009.  Early life  Frenchie was born and raised in South Jamaica, Queens. He spent much of his life travelling back and forth between Queens and Atlanta. His cousin is Waka Flocka Flame. His childhood friend is Lloyd Banks, and his neighbors included other members who founded G-Unit namely Tony Yayo and 50 Cent. According to interviews, Hogan's father Big Frenchie was a notable gangster and drug dealer in the borough in the early 1990s, whom 50 Cent has referenced and idolized in his earlier work most notably on \\"50 Bars\\" and \\"Ghetto Quran\\". Hogan wanted to become a rapper having been inspired after watching Kris Kross' song \\"Jump\\" on Video Music Box at an early age. He is of Guyanese ancestry.  Music career  Frenchie hails from a musical family background with several of his relatives in the industry. His cousin Bimmy was an A&R; for Def Jam Recordings while his uncle from his father's side DJ Hurricane worked with the Beastie Boys. His cousin/aunt Debra Antney was manager to Southern rappers Gucci Mane and OJ Da Juiceman. Frenchie began rapping when he was 19 years old, and would go on to record his first professionally produced track \\"Shirt Off\\" in late 2008. Prior to the record, he had appeared in various \\"street DVDs\\" performing freestyles and cyphers. =2008 - 2011: So Icey Entertainment and 1017 Brick Squad = During a trip to Atlanta to attend a family reunion, Frenchie's aunt Debra Antney had introduced him to rapper Gucci Mane who then signed him to his So Icey Entertainment. The song \\"Shirt Off\\" from Gucci Mane's The Movie mixtape released in September 2008 ‚Äì which featured Frenchie, Wooh Da Kid and OJ Da Juiceman as \\"So Icey Boyz\\" ‚Äì would be Frenchie's breakout track becoming a hit on Atlanta radio. Since then, he had been managed by Debra Antney's Mizay Entertainment. Frenchie released his debut mixtape French Connection on February 22, 2009 hosted by DJ Big Mike and Trap-A-Holics. Later in the year, his camp would go on to form 1017 Brick Squad. His second mixtape Chicken Room, released on September 15, would be his first under the new imprint. Frenchie would be featured on \\"Candy Lady\\" from Gucci Mane's The Burrprint released in October 2009 ‚Äì alongside OJ Da Juiceman, Wooh Da Kid and Waka Flocka Flame ‚Äì which would be the second and last time all members of 1017 Brick Squad collaborated on one song since \\"Shirt Off\\" the year prior. According to interviews, Frenchie had been the one to introduce Nicki Minaj to Debra Antney who then became her manager, prior to the latter's mainstream breakout. In an interview with DJ Lazy K in December 2009, Frenchie announced plans for an upcoming collaborative tape with French Montana. Although the tape never materialized, Montana would go on to collaborate with Frenchie and others from Brick Squad the following year. Frenchie had introduced Montana to Debra who would sign him later in the year. In March 2010, Frenchie's friend and frequent collaborator Brooklyn rapper G-Baby was shot to death in Queens, New York. The two had collaborated on several tracks off of Frenchie's fifth mixtape Trap To The Future released on March 29, and his sixth mixtape French Connection Part 2 released on July 18. =2011 - 2014: Brick Squad Monopoly= Starting in 2011, Frenchie would spend most of his time in Atlanta and touring with 1017 Brick Squad and Mizay Entertainment. That year, Waka Flocka Flame would go on to form Brick Squad Monopoly with Frenchie as one of the original members. He released his eighth mixtape Bringing Gangsta Back on June 25, and his ninth mixtape Concrete Jungle on October 17. In December 2011, fellow BSM member Slim Dunkin was shot to death during an altercation. In 2012, Frenchie released his tenth mixtape French-Elo Anthony on March 10, and his eleventh mixtape Concrete Jungle 2 on December 17. On May 21, 2013, he released his twelfth mixtape Long Over Due, aptly titled so having felt the need to showcase a solo effort with fewer guest features compared to his previous records. Later that year, Gucci Mane and Waka Flocka Flame would become embroiled in a rather public falling-out, with Frenchie noticeably on the side of his cousin Waka Flocka. However, when asked about the incident a year later, Frenchie affirmed that the event was blown out of proportion by the media, and they were all currently on good terms. In 2013, Frenchie released the singles \\"Power Moves\\" and \\"Don't Know Em\\" which peaked at Mediabase urban charts at #44 and #89, respectively. He appeared on MTV's RapFix Live on March 27, and on the VH1 show Black Ink Crew which aired on October 7. On December 29, his cousin and fellow BSM member KayO Redd committed suicide. KayO, who is Debra's youngest son, had died from a self-inflicted gunshot. In 2014, Frenchie released a collaborative mixtape entitled Underrated with rapper D-Dash on January 14, and released his fourteenth mixtape Long Over Due 2 on March 3. It would be his last releases under Brick Squad Monopoly and manager Debra Antney, with Frenchie venturing off under his own label later in the year. Having accompanied Waka Flocka, Steve Aoki and Borgore on tour the year before, he also showed a new-found interest in EDM which he expressed plans to pursue in the future. =2014 - present: Protekted Records = On September 9, 2014, Frenchie announced he was joining Protekted Records, an independent label he helped found with Karen Fraiberg and Jon Gornbein. Under the new management, he would go on to release his fifteenth mixtape on September 16 entitled Fukk Fame.

He was noted, during his lifetime, for finely detailed miniature portrait paintings often featuring the head of a Tyrolean gentleman. However, he also painted a number of ‚Äòtrue‚Äô genre paintings. These tiny masterpieces allowed the artist to display his immense talent and, are even today, sought after by collectors of Academic art. Work During his lifetime he exhibited a number of works at the various exhibition-halls in Europe and won medals at exhibitions in Vienna (1873) and Munich (1901). Among his exhibited works were: *'Law Proceedings' (1873) *'Last Will' (1875) *'At the Baptismal Feast' (1876) *'Aunt is Coming' (1876) *'Theft Discovered too Late' (1880).

Biography Simek was born to Josef and Vlasta (n√©e Hedlicka) Simek on November 13, 1926, in Ogema, Wisconsin, where he was also raised. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II. He worked in a series of jobs and positions during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1960, Simek and his wife, Frances Simek, moved from Chicago, Illinois, to Medford, Wisconsin. Pep Simek, and his brother, Ronald Simek, were the co-owners and bartenders of the Tombstone Tavern in Medford by 1962. The Tombstone Tavern was located adjacent to a cemetery, leading to the origin of its name. Pep and Ronald set up a side business making pizzas at the Tavern's tiny 6'X6' kitchen in the back of the bar to bring in extra income, effectively founding Tombstone Pizza with three other people, including Ron Simek, in 1962. Pep Simek tinkered with the recipe after breaking his leg, improving the taste of the pizzas in the process. Simek consulted with the owner of a pizza shop in Chicago, who advised him on the spices needed to flavor the Tombstone pizzas. The new pizzas proved popular. Within three years, Simek began selling them throughout Medford at the rate of 2,000 pizza pies per day. Pep Simek and his brother sold the pizzas utilizing the advertising tagline, \\"What do you want on your Tombstone?\\" Simek served as CEO and chairman of the board of directors of Tombstone pizza until the business was sold to Kraft Foods in 1986. Tombstone was later acquired by Nestl√© in 2010. Pep Simek opened a second pizzeria, Pep's Pizza, in Medford following Tombstone's sale to Kraft. Simek also pursued other business and philanthropic ventures after Tombstone. He purchased the Enerquip company in Medford. He also entered into the travel and leisure industry, acquiring the Paradise Shores Hotel and Resort in Lake Holcombe, Wisconsin, and Captain Morgan's Retreat in Belize. In 1987, Simek purchased the Embassy Suites and Regency Suites Hotel complex in Green Bay, Wisconsin. He sold his Green Bay hotels in 2007 to the LodgeWorks corporation. Simek and his wife donated more than one million dollars to Holy Rosary Catholic Church in Medford. The couple also donated $900,000 to fund a new fire station and the Simek Recreation Center. Frances Simek, with the support of her husband, gave one million dollars to construct a new Medford library to halt an ongoing dispute over a source of funding. Joseph \\"Pep\\" Simek died at St. Luke's Medical Center, where he had been hospitalized for two weeks, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on February 18, 2013, at the age of 86. His wife, Frances, died in 2010. Simek was survived by three children, Joseph Jr., Richard, and Lauren; and five siblings ‚Äì Gloria Olmstead, Vlasta Cummings, Bill, and Dan Simek. Ronald Simek, a co-founder of Tombstone Pizza, passed on January 20, 2015. Joseph \\"Pepe\\" Simek's interment was at Mount Olive Cemetery in Westboro, Wisconsin.

Lyrics for \\"Engadi Porandha\\" was written by Vignesh Shivan, director of Podaa Podi.  Critical reception  Vanakkam Chennai received positive reviews from critics. S Saraswathi of Rediff said, \\"Vanakkam Chennai is a fun-filled, but slow paced romantic film that does not boast of a great or original storyline. But there is simplicity and charm in the characters. And the great music certainly keeps you entertained.\\" Prashanth Reddy of Desimartini said, \\"Anirudh's music is a huge positive and I can't seem to get a few of the background tunes out of my head. Priya Anand looks utterly gorgeous in every frame. But \\"Vanakkam Chennai\\" is still just an okay-ish Rom-com that is hard to hate. It is does very little to reinvigorate a stagnant genre. Also, it should have avoided using Santhanam.\\" Baradwaj Rangan of The Hindu called it \\"A low-key bliss-out for the most part.\\" Behindwoods said, \\"The first half trots along merrily with Ajay (Shiva) and Anjali (Priya Anand) indulging in one-upmanship that stirs up several laughs and saves the audience the trouble of wondering about the story's progress. But the second half, despite Santhanam's shenanigans, plays out more like a drama. This in turn stretches the movie to a running time of 2 hours and 31 minutes and much like Rosy Aunty, Vanakkam Chennai too takes its own time to say goodbye.\\" IndiaGlitz said, \\"Though a rather predictable story, the knack of this success lies in the way it has been wrapped and presented. As you sit through the movie, it is natural for anyone to forget that Kiruthiga is a debutante director for, she has worked this movie to perfection in every frame.\\" Sify said, \\"The film has nothing new to offer but is still enjoyable due to its glossy packaging, rich visuals and lots of fun. It‚Äôs a charming film made with heart. Give it a chance, you won‚Äôt be disappointed.\\"  References  External links  * 2010s Tamil-language films 2013 films Films scored by Anirudh Ravichander Films set in Chennai Films set in London Films set in Theni Films using stop-motion animation Indian films with live action and animation Indian films Indian romantic comedy films Tamil-language films 2013 directorial debut films 2013 romantic comedy films ","title":"Vanakkam Chennai"},{"id":"38582989","text":"Kyle of Durness looking north towards Balnakeil Bay Kyle of Durness is a coastal inlet on the north coast of Scotland in the county of Sutherland.

In 1740 he was sent as an assistant engineer to improve the fortifications of the island of Grenada, where he was appointed chief engineer in 1748. Le Romain provided nearly seventy articles on the Caribbean between volumes III and XVI of the Encyclop√©die of Diderot and D'Alembert. More than half of his articles are short descriptions of production, animals, minerals and geography of the Caribbean islands. He provided more detail of the production of regional products such as indigo, sugar and foods derived from cassava. Le Romain also wrote the entry for 'negroes' which reflects the colonial prejudices against blacks, referring to them as \\"barbarians\\".English translation of Le Romain's Encyclop√©die entry for 'Negroes' A competent naturalist, Le Romain's contributions gave Diderot and d'Alembert first-hand information on the Caribbean and thus an expanded view of the world for their Encyclop√©die.

Illustration from Sugata Saurabha showing the Buddha's father ≈öuddhodana. Sugata Saurabha (Devanagari: ‡§∏‡•Å‡§ó‡§§ ‡§∏‡•å‡§∞‡§≠) is an epic poem in Nepal Bhasa by Chittadhar Hridaya (1906 ‚Äì 1982), one of the greatest literary figures from Nepal in the 20th century. Sugata Saurabha, meaning ‚ÄúThe Fragrant Life of the Buddha‚Äù, is based on the life story of Gautama Buddha. Written in jail Sugata Saurabha is Hridaya's greatest work which he composed while in prison from 1941 to 1945 in Kathmandu. He was given a six-year jail sentence for writing a poem in his mother tongue, which the autocratic Rana regime sought to suppress.Lewis, Todd T., and Tuladhar, Subarna Man (2009). Sugata Saurabha - An Epic Poem from Nepal on the Life of the Buddha by Chittadhar Hridaya. New York: Oxford University Press. . Page 6. Hridaya wrote Sugata Saurabha in secret in prison, and his sister Moti Laxmi Upasika would smuggle out the scraps of paper on which he had scribbled the verses when she brought him his food. The storyline Sugata Saurabha relates the Buddha's life from birth to enlightenment to death in 19 chapters. The life story is based on classical sources, but Hridaya has filled in details from the Nepalese sociocultural context where they are not mentioned. The epic has been described as providing an aesthetically pleasing and doctrinally sound comprehensive account of the Buddha's life, and a magnum opus in Nepal Bhasa literature. The 19 chapters in Sugata Saurabha are entitled: 1. Lumbinƒ´ 2. Family Tree 3. Nativity 4. Mother 5. A Pleasant Childhood 6. Education 7. Marriage 8. The Great Renunciation 9. YashodharƒÅ 10. Attaining Enlightenment 11. The Basic Teachings 12. The Blessed One in Kapilavastu 13. Handsome Nanda 14. The Great Lay Disciple 15. Twelve Years of Itinerant Preaching 16. A Dispute over Water 17. The Monastery Built by VishƒÅkhƒÅ 18. Devadatta's Sacrilege and 19. Entry into NirvƒÅna. First publication Hridaya finished the epic in 1946, a year after he was released from prison. Sugata Saurabha was first published from Kolkata, India in 1949.

Former entrance on the Witte Herenstraat The Coomanshof is a former hofje in Haarlem, Netherlands, on the Witte Heren straat. It was named the \\"mercerie\\" or cramersneringhe after the local merchant's guild that existed from 1407. The small guild house dates from 1644. The hofje that grew around it is typical of the type of occupational hofjes such as the Brouwershofje that grew out of the local Brewer's guild. The patron saint of the merchants was Saint Nicholas, also the patron saint of Amsterdam. When the guilds were disbanded under Napoleon in 1798, the hofje was rented out until 1854 when it was sold. When the local head of the archives Adriaan Justus Ensched√© bought the property in 1871, he demolished the eleven small hofje houses but kept the guild house as a folly for his garden. His main home was on the Zijlstraat. Enschede also found the original gable stone and had it reinstalled in 1871 above the doorway in the Witte Herenstraat. Paradijsje In 1950 Godfried Bomans began his Teisterbant club on the Grote Markt and he was able to rent this guild house and garden as a summer meeting place, which he dubbed \\"Het Paradijsje\\" (little paradise). In 1951 the artist Anton Heyboer moved in and lived there with his wife Elsa and they were later joined by the sculptor Piet van Heerden and his wife.Heyboer: een biografische speurtocht, by Bert Nijmeijer, Nijgh & Van Ditmar, 2012, In the summer months Heyboer hung lanterns in the branches of the orchard in the yard and served fish from IJmuiden to the Teisterbant club members. As an artist he was inspired by the old tiles on the walls and floor of the small guild house and motifs from the floor tiles can be seen in his etchings from this period. In 1955 the garden with the small guild house was bought back from its owner by the city of Haarlem and it was restored in 1962. Today it serves as an artist's workshop and can be reached through the gate of the children's playground called \\"Paradijsje\\".Speeltuin het Paradijsje References * Haarlems hofjes, Dr. G. H.
