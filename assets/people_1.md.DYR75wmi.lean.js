It is one of the several requirements for thermodynamic equilibrium, but it can occur in the absence of thermodynamic equilibrium. There are various types of radiative equilibrium, which is itself a kind of dynamic equilibrium. Definitions Equilibrium, in general, is a state in which opposing forces are balanced, and hence a system does not change in time. Radiative equilibrium is the specific case of thermal equilibrium, for the case in which the exchange of heat is done by radiative heat transfer. There are several types of radiative equilibrium. Prevost's definitions An important early contribution was made by Pierre Prevost in 1791. Prevost considered that what is nowadays called the photon gas or electromagnetic radiation was a fluid that he called \\"free heat\\". Prevost proposed that free radiant heat is a very rare fluid, rays of which, like light rays, pass through each other without detectable disturbance of their passage. Prevost's theory of exchanges stated that each body radiates to, and receives radiation from, other bodies. The radiation from each body is emitted regardless of the presence or absence of other bodies.Maxwell, J.C. (1871). Theory of Heat, Longmans, Green and Co, London, pages 221–222.Partington, J.R. (1949). An Advanced Treatise on Physical Chemistry, volume 1, Fundamental Principles. The Properties of Gases, Longmans, Green and Co, London, page 467. Prevost in 1791 offered the following definitions (translated): > Absolute equilibrium of free heat is the state of this fluid in a portion of > space which receives as much of it as it lets escape. > Relative equilibrium of free heat is the state of this fluid in two portions > of space which receive from each other equal quantities of heat, and which > moreover are in absolute equilibrium, or experience precisely equal changes. Prevost went on to comment that \\"The heat of several portions of space at the same temperature, and next to one another, is at the same time in the two species of equilibrium.\\" Pointwise radiative equilibrium Following Planck (1914), a radiative field is often described in terms of specific radiative intensity, which is a function of each geometrical point in a space region, at an instant of time.Mihalas, D., Weibel-Mihalas, B. (1984). Foundations of Radiation Hydrodynamics, Oxford University Press, New York .Goody, R.M., Yung, Y.L. (1989). Atmospheric Radiation. Theoretical Basis, second edition, Oxford University Press, New York, 1989, . This is slightly different from Prevost's mode of definition, which was for regions of space. It is also slightly conceptually different from Prevost's definition: Prevost thought in terms of bound and free heat while today we think in terms of heat in kinetic and other dynamic energy of molecules, that is to say heat in matter, and the thermal photon gas. A detailed definition is given by Goody and Yung (1989). They think of the interconversion between thermal radiation and heat in matter. From the specific radiative intensity they derive \\\\mathbf{F}_ u, the monochromatic vector flux density of radiation at each point in a region of space, which is equal to the time averaged monochromatic Poynting vector at that point (Mihalas 1978Mihalas, D. (1978). Stellar Atmospheres, 2nd edition, Freeman, San Francisco, . on pages 9–11). They define the monochromatic volume-specific rate of gain of heat by matter from radiation as the negative of the divergence of the monochromatic flux density vector; it is a scalar function of the position of the point: ::: h_ u = - abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F}_ u. They define (pointwise) monochromatic radiative equilibrium by ::: abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F}_ u = 0 at every point of the region that is in radiative equilibrium. They define (pointwise) radiative equilibrium by :::h = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} h_ u d u = 0 at every point of the region that is in radiative equilibrium. This means that, at every point of the region of space that is in (pointwise) radiative equilibrium, the total, for all frequencies of radiation, interconversion of energy between thermal radiation and energy content in matter is nil(zero). Pointwise radiative equilibrium is closely related to Prevost's absolute radiative equilibrium. Mihalas and Weibel-Mihalas (1984) emphasise that this definition applies to a static medium, in which the matter is not moving. They also consider moving media. Approximate pointwise radiative equilibrium Karl Schwarzschild in 1906Schwarzschild, K. (1906). Ueber das Gleichgewicht der Sonnenatmosphaere. Nachrichten von der Koeniglichen Gessellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Goettingen. Math.-phys. Klasse 195: 41–53. Translation in Selected Papers on the Transfer of Radiation, ed. D.H. Menzel, Dover, New York, 1966. considered a system in which convection and radiation both operated but radiation was so much more efficient than convection that convection could be, as an approximation, neglected, and radiation could be considered predominant. This applies when the temperature is very high, as for example in a star, but not in a planet's atmosphere. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (1950, page 290)Chandrasekhar, S. (1950). Radiative Transfer, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1950. writes of a model of a stellar atmosphere in which \\"there are no mechanisms, other than radiation, for transporting heat within the atmosphere ... [and] there are no sources of heat in the surrounding\\" This is hardly different from Schwarzschild's 1906 approximate concept, but is more precisely stated. Radiative exchange equilibrium Planck (1914, page 40)Planck, M. (1914). The Theory of Heat Radiation, second edition translated by M. Masius, P. Blakiston's Son and Co., Philadelphia, 1914. refers to a condition of thermodynamic equilibrium, in which \\"any two bodies or elements of bodies selected at random exchange by radiation equal amounts of heat with each other.\\" The term radiative exchange equilibrium can also be used to refer to two specified regions of space that exchange equal amounts of radiation by emission and absorption (even when the steady state is not one of thermodynamic equilibrium, but is one in which some sub-processes include net transport of matter or energy including radiation). Radiative exchange equilibrium is very nearly the same as Prevost's relative radiative equilibrium. Approximate radiative exchange equilibrium To a first approximation, an example of radiative exchange equilibrium is in the exchange of non-window wavelength thermal radiation between the land-and-sea surface and the lowest atmosphere, when there is a clear sky. As a first approximation (Swinbank 1963,Swinbank, W.C. (963). Long-wave radiation from clear skies, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 89: 339–348. Paltridge and Platt 1976, pages 139–140Paltridge, G.W., Platt, C.M.R., (1976). Radiative Processes in Meteorology and Climatology, Elsevier, Amsterdam, .), in the non-window wavenumbers, there is zero net exchange between the surface and the atmosphere, while, in the window wavenumbers, there is simply direct radiation from the land-sea surface to space. A like situation occurs between adjacent layers in the turbulently mixed boundary layer of the lower troposphere, expressed in the so-called \\"cooling to space approximation\\", first noted by Rodgers and Walshaw (1966).Rodgers, C.D., Walshaw, C.D. (1966). The computation of infrared cooling rate in planetary atmospheres, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 92: 67–92.Paltridge, G.W., Platt, C.M.R., (1976).

Atmospheric Science: An Introductory Survey, 2nd edition, Elsevier, Amsterdam, , page 138. In astronomy and planetary science  Global radiative equilibrium  Global radiative equilibrium can be defined for an entire passive celestial system that does not supply its own energy, such as a planet. Liou (2002, page 459)Liou, K.N. (2002). An Introduction to Atmospheric Radiation, second edition, Academic Press, Amsterdam, 2002, . and other authors use the term global radiative equilibrium to refer to radiative exchange equilibrium globally between the earth and extraterrestrial space; such authors intend to mean that, in the theoretical, incoming solar radiation absorbed by the earth and its atmosphere would be equal to outgoing longwave radiation from the earth and its atmosphere. Prevost would say then that the earth and its atmosphere regarded as a whole were in absolute radiative equilibrium. Some texts, for example Satoh (2004),Satoh, M. (2004). Atmospheric Circulation Dynamics and General Circulation Models, Springer- Praxis, Chichester UK, , page 370. simply refer to \\"radiative equilibrium\\" in referring to global exchange radiative equilibrium. The various global temperatures that may be theoretically conceived for any planet in general can be computed. Such temperatures include the equivalent blackbody temperatureWallace, J.M., Hobbs, P.V.

A radiative equilibrium temperature is calculated for the case that the supply of energy from within the planet (for example, from chemical or nuclear sources) is negligibly small; this assumption is reasonable for the Earth, but fails, for example, for calculating the temperature of Jupiter, for which internal energy sources are larger than the incident solar radiation,Aumann, H. H.; Gillespie, C. M., Jr.; and Low, F. J. (July 1969). The Internal Powers and Effective Temperatures of Jupiter and Saturn\\", Astrophysical Journal, 157 p. L69. DOI: 10.1086/180388. Retrieved 2019-06-19. and hence the actual temperature is higher than the theoretical radiative equilibrium.  Stellar equilibrium  A star supplies its own energy from nuclear sources, and hence the temperature equilibrium cannot be defined in terms of incident energy only. Cox and Giuli (1968/1984)Cox, J.P. with Giuli, R.T. (1968, reprint 1984). Principles of Stellar Structure, Gordon and Breach, New York, , page 134. define 'radiative equilibrium' for a star, taken as a whole and not confining attention only to its atmosphere, when the rate of transfer as heat of energy from nuclear reactions plus viscosity to the microscopic motions of the material particles of the star is just balanced by the transfer of energy by electromagnetic radiation from the star to space. Note that this radiative equilibrium is slightly different from the previous usage. They note that a star that is radiating energy to space cannot be in a steady state of temperature distribution unless there is a supply of energy, in this case, energy from nuclear reactions within the star, to support the radiation to space. Likewise the condition that is used for the above definition of pointwise radiative equilibrium cannot hold throughout a star that is radiating: internally, the star is in a steady state of temperature distribution, not internal thermodynamic equilibrium. Cox and Giuli's definition allows them to say at the same time that a star is in a steady state of temperature distribution and is in 'radiative equilibrium'; they are assuming that all the radiative energy to space comes from within the star. Mechanisms of radiative equilibrium When there is enough matter in a region to allow molecular collisions to occur very much more often than creation or annihilation of photons, for radiation one speaks of local thermodynamic equilibrium. In this case, Kirchhoff's law of equality of radiative absorptivity and emissivity holds.Milne, E.A. (1928). The effect of collisions on monochromatic radiative equilibrium, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society 88: 493–502 Two bodies in radiative exchange equilibrium, each in its own local thermodynamic equilibrium, have the same temperature and their radiative exchange complies with the Stokes- Helmholtz reciprocity principle.

The paper is not only the foundation of the stamp but it has also been incorporated into the stamp's design, has provided security against fraud and has aided in the automation of the postal delivery system. Stamp catalogs like Scott's Standard Postage Stamp Catalog (SC) often document the paper the stamp is printed on to describe a stamp's classification. The same stamp design can appear on several kinds of paper. Stamp collectors and philatelists understand that a stamp's paper not only defines a unique stamp but could also mean the difference between an inexpensive stamp from one that is rare and worth more than its common counterpart. Making an accurate determination of the stamp's paper may require special tools such as a micrometer to measure the thickness of a stamp, certain fluid chemicals to reveal hidden features, magnifying glasses or loupes to see fine details, digital microscopes to examine the minutest details of the paper or ultraviolet light to illuminate the paper to reveal its glowing aspects. Certain paper types may require the services of an expert as the only sure way of knowing the true identity of the stamp's paper. The stamp is under the examination of a magnifying glass Paper characteristics All paper is endowed with certain characteristics by its maker. Depending on the purpose of the paper, the craftsman will choose specific materials and apply certain manufacturing processes to achieve the design objectives. Characteristics such as composition, weight, color, size, watermark, surface finish, opacity, hardness and strength all have to be established before the papermaker can begin his work. The making of paper can be broken down into three phases; the preparing of the pulp into a suspension of fibers; the forming of the paper on a mould or an endless wire mesh; and lastly the finishing of the paper's surface and drying. From a philatelic interest, it is the second phase, the forming of the paper that yields the most interesting characteristics. Pulp dyed orange to match Princeton University's school colors for the 1956 Nassau Hall 200th anniversary In the first phase of papermaking the characteristics such as its composition, color and weight is determined. Paper has as its chief component, a mat of cellulose fibers. Cellulose is the skeleton structure of plant cells and can be separated from the plant for use in paper. Cellulose has several characteristics that make it desirable for paper, the foremost being its strength when formed into a mat or web. When cellulose fibers come in contact with each other in water, a bond is formed. When water is removed from the adjoining fibers, the bond between the fibers strengthens. Pulp, the collection of individual fibers, may be bleached, especially if the paper is to be dyed a different color or the paper is expected to be white. Since most paper is either printed or written upon, fillers are added to the pulp to fill the pores of the paper and sizing is added to make the fibers water resistant, yet both act as fillers. Unsized paper is blotting paper, making it unsuitable for printing. Fillers and sizing are added to the pulp to absorb the ink quickly, unlike pure cellulose. Fillers can be glues made from animal products, starches from rice or wheat, resins or gums, or minerals such as calcium carbonate, titanium dioxide or kaolin. Mineral fillers are the most common as they are very effective as a filler. When all of these ingredients are assembled, they are suspended in water, which may include a color dye, as the furnish to the second phase of papermaking. The paper is formed in the second stage of papermaking. With handmade paper, the furnish is stored in a vat and the craftsman uses a mould to strain out enough material to form a sheet of paper. The mould determines the dimensions of the finished sheet and its weight, which ultimately establishes the paper’s thickness. The mould is usually a wire mesh that acts as a strainer such that the furnish is separated out of the water. The water drains off, leaving layers upon layers of fibers or a web of paper on the mould. The texture of the paper is determined by the nature of the mould. Wove paper has a uniform texture while laid paper has a fine-lined texture created by wires that are attached to the wire mesh. If a watermark is part of the paper’s design, it is the mould that creates the watermark, in the same way that the fine lines of laid paper are created. A watermark is a deliberate thinning of the paper by the placing of either wires or metal shapes, called bits, onto the wire mesh of the mould. When the mould is removed from the vat, the water drains causing the pulp to be deposited more between the wires or bits relative to the top of the bits or wires. When the dried paper is held up to a light, the thinner paper will appear lighter in contrast to the thicker paper, thus creating a watermark. Numerous countries have used a variety of designs for their watermarks as a means to prevent forgery of stamps, making the watermark of particular philatelic interest. In comparison, machine-made paper is made on the Fourdrinier machine by drawing the furnish out of a vat onto an endless wire mesh. The paper, shortly after being drawn from the vat, is usually pressed with a Dandy roll as the mechanism to imprint a watermark onto the paper. Machine-made paper can produce single sheets of paper or one large continuous web of paper that is collected to form large rolls. One characteristic of machine-made paper is that it creates a direction or an alignment of the fibers, which directly impacts its strength. This is of particular importance when tearing the paper, as one would do to separate a stamp for use. When the tear is aligned with the direction of the fibers, the paper will tear evenly. When the tear is opposed to the direction of the fibers, the paper will tear unevenly, in a jagged line. Handmade paper disperses the fibers in unpredictable directions and therefore yields a paper with the most overall strength. A paper’s strength had an influence on the separation methods used for a stamp. For example, a stronger paper may have needed a higher number of perforations per inch to best facilitate the separation of the stamps. Similarly, many stamps have two different standards of perforation for its length and width to optimize the ease of separation while minimizing the cost of manufacturing. In the last stage of papermaking, the paper is finished and dried. The finishing of the paper can include the application of a coating that will produce the best effects when printed upon. The coating is a fine layer of special sizing applied to one or both sides of the paper to fill in all of the pores and to smooth out the surface of the paper. A glossy appearance often is a characteristic of coated paper. Once the coating is applied, the paper making process is complete. Certain postage stamps have been printed on security paper, which is paper that has additional characteristics coated or printed onto the paper to prevent the reuse of the postage stamp and as a means to prevent forgery. Shrinkage Shrinkage is a characteristic of paper because of the nature of cellulose fibers. The cellulose fiber is hygroscopic and acts like a sponge when immersed in water. The fibers expand in their width and not in their length. With handmade paper, because there is no direction associated with the fibers, the paper expands and shrinks unevenly in both the length and width of the finished sheet. With machine-made paper, because there is a direction to the fibers, the paper shrinks unevenly, that is, less in its length (in the direction of the fibers) and more in its width (in the direction opposite of the fibers). This characteristic is important to the printer because certain printing techniques required the paper to be dampened prior to printing. As such, when the paper dried, the uneven shrinkage of machine-made paper would produce an image of different proportions than the die that created it. The differences in appearance between wet and dry printed stamps can sometimes be quite noticeable, with dry printed stamps generally having sharper images on stiffer and thicker paper.The Wet and Dry Printing Methods on U.S. StampsWhat's the difference between dry printing and wet printing? Watermarks Watermarks are created in the paper by special pieces of bent wire or bits, either attached to the mould or attached to the Dandy roll of machine-made paper. The watermark is inherently created differently by these two methods. In the case of the mould, the watermark is created by the settling of the fibers on the mould, thus creating the intentional thinning of the paper. In the case of the Dandy Roll, the watermark is pressed into the wet pulp. The papermaker closely adjusts the pressure the Dandy Roll exerts on the paper to ensure a proper impression of the watermark design into the paper. Too little pressure and the watermark may not be detectable. Philatelically, there are several descriptive terms used to categorize watermarks. Multiple watermark when viewed from the back of the stamp. :* Simple – When the entire watermark design can be seen on each individual stamp. :* Multiple – When the watermark design can be seen several times on a single stamp or portions of several instances of the design are visible on a single stamp. For example, the watermarked stamps of Great Britain and her colonies. :* Sheet – When the watermark design is so large that it covers multiple stamps such that only a portion of the watermark design is on a single stamp. For example, on India's Coat of Arms watermark of 1854 :* Paper-makers – When the watermark documents the papermaker's name, the trade name of the paper or in some instances the stamp contractor or printer. These are similar to sheet watermarks. For example, the \\"Harrison & Sons, London\\" watermark used for Maldive Islands 1933 issue. :* Stitch – The unintentional watermark that is created by the joining of the endless wire mesh belt used in machine-made papermaking. :* Marginal – When the watermark design appears in the sheet margins. Examples can be found in the many British Commonwealth issues. :* Pattern – When wavy lines, lozenges, diamond mesh and others such that the pattern is repeated evenly over the whole stamp. For example, the lozenges pattern on Germany Empire's 1905-19 issue or circles pattern on the 1920 issue. :* False – When the appearance of a watermark is created by lightly printing on the stamp. For example, the quadrille pattern printed on France's 1892 15c issue. Normal and Single watermark as seen from the back of the stamp. :Lastly, by way of orientation. These designations describe the orientation of the watermark with respect to the stamp's design. :::::::* Normal – When the watermark coincides with the design of the stamp when viewed from the front of the stamp. The watermark will be mirrored when viewed from the back of the stamp. :::::::* Inverted – When the watermark is upside down when viewed from the front of the stamp. That is, when the stamp's printed design is right side up and the watermark design is upside down. :::::::* Reversed – When the watermark is reversed when viewed from the front of the stamp. The watermark will be un-mirrored when viewed from the back. For example, letter watermarks would not be reversed when viewed from the back of the stamp. :::::::* Inverted and reversed – When the watermark is both upside down and reversed when viewed from the front of the stamp. :::::::* Sideways – When the watermark is rotated 90° with respect to the stamp's design.  Watermark detection  Watermark detection can be as simple as holding the stamp up to a light or by placing it face down on a black surface. If this does not reveal the watermark there are fluids, electrical devices and ink pads that may reveal the thinning of the paper; :* A special stamp watermark detecting fluid may be applied to a stamp lying face down in a black plastic tray. As the fluid evaporates the watermark becomes visible and as it does not contain water the fluid may be used on mint stamps without damaging the gum. A drop of benzine can also be used to coax the watermark out of the paper but care should be observed as the inks of photogravure stamps are soluble in benzine and will ruin the stamp. :* There are various mains or battery powered devices available in which the stamp is placed on a metal plate and a clear plastic block is pressed down onto it. A light is then switched on to reveal the watermark. :* With the 'Morley Bright' detector the stamp is placed face down in a unit that contains ink in a sealed sachet that flows into the watermarked area of the stamp under thumb pressure. :* There are color- filtering techniques that neutralize the color of the stamp's design, thus making it easier to see the watermark. There is a device known as the Philatector that electronically employs a set of color filters as a means to detect the watermark. :* If the reverse of a stamp is placed on a black background on a computer scanner and graphics software is used to adjust the color saturation and contrast this may in some cases increase visibility of a watermark. Flaws and Errors While the words flaws and errors as synonymous, they are used to distinctly describe either a defect in the stamp's paper or when an incorrect paper was used in the printing of the stamp. Flaws describe faults or defects in the paper of the stamp, typical of handling after manufacturing or less frequently during the manufacturing of the paper. Errors describe an incorrect type of paper used to print a stamp, typically the use of watermarked paper when it was not specified for the issue. While a paper fault represents a damaged or defective stamp that devalues its worth, paper errors have the opposite effect and are sought after by collectors. Flaws During the manufacturing of paper, flaws can occur in the web. One such flaw is the pinhole. The term is used to designate a small blemish typically characterized by a small hole in the substance of the paper. Pinholes are typical of very thin paper and can be found by holding the stamp up to light. abasi stamp. A rare flaw in paper is when the watermark bit has been improperly repaired on the Dandy roll. Great Britain's Emblems watermark is composed of two roses, one shamrock and one thistle. A defect was created when the Dandy roll was repaired and instead of a thistle bit, a rose bit was added creating the three roses and a shamrock flaw. This flaw is found on Great Britain's 1862 3d (plate 2), 1865-67 3 d (plate 4), 6 d (plates 5 and 6), 9d (plate 4) and 1s (plate 4).Leon Norman Williams, Fundamentals of Philately, 1990 page 82 Another paper flaw is a crease. A crease is when the paper becomes an overlapped fold, which subsequently is printed upon. This kind of crease is more of a printing error as it is a paper flaw. Creased stamps can also occur as a result of handling, where it's clear that the stamp has been folded. Overlapped fold found in a Mexican 1897-98 4c stamp. Another common handling flaw is a tear. The torn stamp is usually complete but the paper is partially ripped. Tearing a piece off of the stamp, however, is how the Afghan postal clerk cancelled a stamp and so this is not a flaw but evidence that the stamp was probably postally used,R. J. Sutton, The Stamp Collector's Encyclopaedia 1967 page 309 especially if the stamp is still on the postal matter. A stamp can be damaged if it is soaked off of a water- soluble colored paper. For numerous occasions, people send greeting cards in envelopes that are on colored paper. The worst offender is the red envelope. If warm water is used in soaking the stamp from the paper of the envelope, the red dye can and does bleed into the stamp's paper, leaving it tinted red. This is not a stamp variety but simply a damaged stamp. Yellow and blue dyes in colored paper bleed into a stamps too. A thin is created when a stamp is improperly removed from the paper it was attached. Since paper is created by depositing layers of fibers onto each other to form a web, they can be separated by the layers too. When the paper is finished, the outside layers become the strongest layers. Soaking a stamp in water is the usual way of removing it from the postal matter. Water will dissolve the glue used as the adhesive but it also weakens the bonds of the paper's fibers. Just as the removal of water strengthens the bonding between fibers, adding water weakens them. A failed attempt at removing the stamp from other paper typically results in portion of the stamp's paper being left attached to the postal matter. Thins can be created in a variety of ways and all result in a damaged stamp. The US $1 Woodrow Wilson Presidential Series stamp Errors Errors of paper are created when the incorrect paper is used for the stamp's design rather than a papermaking defect. One example of this is when the watermarked paper intended for use with U.S. revenue stamps was used for the $1 Woodrow Wilson stamp (SC#832). The mistake was made sometime between 1950 and 1951 and some 160,000 to 400,000 copies are estimated to have been printed.Roland E. Rustad, The Prexies 1994 page 316 Comparative paper terms When the paper of the stamp is described, stamp catalogs often use words that are relative, such as thick and thin. This is done to describe the variations of the stamp's paper in a particular issue. Thick may be as much as 0.005 inches and thin as little as 0.001 inches, with medium somewhere in between. Paper can described as being opaque, semi-translucent and semi-transparent. The opacity of the stamp describes the ability of light to shine through the paper. If no light shines through the paper, then it is opaque. If some light passes through, in any amount, the paper is semi-translucent. Transparency describes the ability to see an object through the paper or when the paper is placed over printed letters the ability to see the printing through the paper. If the stamp's design can be seen through the back of the stamp, then it is semi-transparent. Another comparative set of terms refers to the paper's hardness. Hard, stout hard, and soft have been used to describe the paper. Experts have described the snap of the stamp when flicked as a means to determine if the stamp was printed on hard or soft paper. A sharper snap implied hard paper because the hardness is a characteristic of the amount or kind of sizing used when making the paper. Porous paper is used to describe paper as absorbent, usually in contrast to less absorbent paper used in the stamps of the same country. Porosity is a characteristic of paper. Wood fibers are hydrophilic or water loving. Sizing is added to paper to create a resistance to water as well as to fill in the gaps between the fibers. Porosity is a measure of how the paper responds to a liquid. There are several popular stamp collecting terms. On- paper refers to any stamp that is still adhering to another piece of paper. Similarly, off-paper is used to describe a postally used stamp that is no longer adhering to any other kind of paper. Wallpaper is the slang name given to the sheets of stamps that have little or no philatelic or monetary value. Stamp paper varieties Philatelically, stamp paper can be partitioned into a few large groups. The first that is typically encountered in the stamp catalogs describes the texture of the paper, such as wove or laid. Many stamps have been printed with these different paper textures. Other groups can be formed as: Colored paper, safety or security paper and coated paper. In a stamp catalog, a stamp's paper is usually identified at the beginning of the issue. It will also be identified when the paper changes either within the issue or with the next issue. When colored paper is used for the stamp, the ink colors are listed first and then the paper's color is listed next in italics. Sometimes the paper is described as ordinary, which simply means that the common paper of the period was used. Coated paper is usually not listed but may be surmised by the printing process used to print the stamp. For example, photogravure printing yields the best clarity when printed on coated papers. {border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" ! style=\\"width:13%;\\"|Paper ! style=\\"width:20%;\\"|Image ! style=\\"width:39%;\\"|Description ! style=\\"width:28%;\\"|Stamp examples |- ! Art ↔ Art paper is a very high gloss coated paper similar to magazine paper. As a super fine calendared paper that is coated with china clay to give it an enameled finish, it is useful for printing fine-screen half-tone blocks. * India - Kishangarh SC#37 * New Zealand SC#179-181 |- ! Batonné ↔ Batonné paper describes its texture and is similar to laid paper but has far fewer lines, typically spaced about ½ apart.Leon Norman Williams, Fundamentals of Philately, 1990 page 51 The spacing of the lines is similar to lined paper, which act as guide lines. Batonné paper may be either wove or laid. When it is formed in laid paper, fine laid lines are visible between the batons. Batonné is from the French meaning baton or staff. * Afghanistan SC#157-161 * Fiji SC#6 |- ! Bluish ↔ The bluish color of this paper is a result of an unintentional chemical reaction of the constituents of the furnish. Another potential cause may be the presence of prussiate of potassium in the ink or latent in the paper. When the paper was dampened prior to printing, the paper fibers were dyed blue. Other terms are the French word blueté or blue rag paper. * U.S. SC#357 - 366 * Great Britain SC#8-17 |- ! Cardboard ↔ Cardboard is a thick white paper that is typically not used for postage stamps. The best examples are the quasi-stamps of Russia, when contrary to regulations, were printed on paper intended for paper currency. U.S. plate proofs are also printed on cardboard. * Russia SC#105-107 |- ! Chalky Chalked-surface ↔ Chalk paper is a type of safety paper that was designed to cause the stamp's design to rub off or smear when an attempt was made to remove the cancellation on the stamp. The paper was coated with a solution containing a suspension of chalk. The British government used chalky paper in many of its colonies. One destructive test of chalk paper is to rub a piece of silver on the paper. A black, pencil-like mark will result if the paper is chalky. * British Honduras SC# 62-71 (chalky) * Mozambique Company SC#4 (chalked-surface) |- ! Colored Great Britain with offices in China, stamps of Hong Kong SC#7 printed on yellow paper Colored paper can be found in any number of colors. Since color is added to the pulp, the color is present throughout the paper. To identify colored paper, examine both sides of the stamp including the perforated edges. There is tinted paper as well as surface-colored stamps (Great Britain's White Backs as an example), where color was applied intentionally after the normal processes of papermaking were finished. * Afghanistan SC#191-195 * Hong Kong SC#89, 94, 96, 102 |- ! Double Joined ↔ Rotary printing presses require long continuous rolls to keep the presses operational. When one roll was exhausted, another was joined to the end of the first roll to keep the press fed with paper. Where the two lengths of paper were overlapped, a seam was formed creating a double thickness of paper. Normally, these seams were cut from the sheets but occasionally these double paper stamps slipped the inspector's eye and entered into post office stocks. Up until the 1950s, the Scott's catalog listed them with a unique designation. But because double paper stamps became so common, Scott's stopped listing them with a special designation. * U.S. Rotary press issues |- ! Double (Security) Duplex ↔ Duplex or two-ply paper has two different papers bonded together to form a single finished sheet of paper. The first ply of paper was unsized, therefore very absorbent and would take the cancellation easily. The second ply was sized and much stronger. Charles F Steel patentedInventor Charles F Steel, patent number 86,952 this double (security) paper to address the U.S. fraud problem in the 1870s. If a person were to attempt to remove the cancellation, the first tissue-like layer of paper, that the stamp's design was printed, would rub off, thereby destroying the stamp. * U.S. SC#156 |- ! Enameled ↔ This paper is similar to chalky paper but appears slightly grayish. When held up to a light, rather than a uniform appearance, enameled paper is distinctly mottled. * Angola SC#26 * Mozambique Company SC# 4, 6-9 |- ! Goldbeaters skin ↔ Goldbeaters skin was a tough paper that was made transparent with resin or collodium. The stamp's design was printed in reverse on the back of the paper and the adhesive was applied over the design. When the stamp was applied to the letter, the stamp's design appeared through the paper correctly. This paper can also be referred to as resinized paper. Prussia SC #21-22 |- ! Glazed Glazed paper with a glossy finish Glazed paper is given a glossy finish by glazing with friction of applied heat versus a glossy finish created by a coating. It is synonymous with surfaced-paper. * El Salvador SC#336-348 * India SC#9-10 (Blue glazed paper) |- ! Granite Granite Paper of Switzerland SC#65 magnified 35x Granite paper has colored (typically red and/or blue) silk fibers added to the furnish. Another name for granite paper was silurian paper1905 Scott's Catalog - Silurian paper as it only contained blue fibers and the paper was bluish-gray. * Switzerland SC#60-68 * U.S. SC#1252, 1326 |- ! Native ↔ Native paper describes the paper local to the region the stamps were originally printed on. The composition of the furnish was of local materials. European paper typically replaced native papers. * Japan SC# * Nepal SC#7 * Tibet SC#1 |- ! Laid Vertical laid paper (light and dark lines can be seen in the bottom border) When laid paper is held up to a light, its texture can be seen as light and dark lines. The lines are not a result of the printing but are a result of the paper making process. When the stamp's design is printed on laid paper, the lines can be either vertical or horizontal. * Bulgaria SC#1-27 Horizontal * Russia SC#55-71 Vertical |- ! Oblong quadrille ↔ The texture of oblong quadrille results from wires on the paper mould that form a rectangular pattern. This texture is similar to quadrille and laid as it is formed in the same manner. * Mexico - Guadalajara SC# 38-41 * Colombia - Tolima SC# 74-75 |- ! Palimpsest Printed on blue-lined paper The term palimpsest actually is defined as parchment or velum that has been reused to the extent that the previous writing can still be faintly seen. Philatelically, paper that was originally designed to be used for another purpose and then used for printing of stamps is also categorized as palimpsest. The most famous are from Latvia, when after World War I, the Latvian government printed stamps on the back of German military maps. Later, Latvia printed stamps on the backs of unfinished banknotes of the Bolshevists and the government of Colonel Bermondt-Avalov. * Latvia SC#1 and 68-69 * Mexico SC#195-211 |- ! Pelure Pelure paper's transparency demonstrated by placing over the words PELURE; Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic 1924 100r Thin, often brittle, semi-transparent paper and can be either woven or laid and is rendered semi- transparent by the resins used in the manufacturing of the paper. Stamps printed on pelure paper sometimes do not survive wholly intact because of their brittle nature. Pelure is easily identified because of its transparency. Pelure is a French word meaning skin or peel, like that of a banana, which is why sometimes this paper is compared to onionskin paper. * Latvia SC#9-56 * Colombia SC#303-313 * Russia SC#181a |- ! Phosphored-coated ↔ Luminescence is a characteristic of the mineral zinc orthosilicate, which glows a yellowish-green when illuminated with shortwave ultraviolet light. The U.S first issue that used phosphor-coated paper was the Flag over Yosemite definitive coil in 1989. * U.S. SC#2280 |- ! Quadrille Front and back of France's 1892 15c quadrille printed paper Quadrille describes the texture of this paper, where the laid lines form small squares about 1/8 of an inch. This texture is similar to laid and oblong quadrille because they are formed by the mould in the same manner. There have been instances when the quadrille pattern was lightly printed onto the paper after it was made. * Fiji SC#1-5 (paper) * France SC#103 (printed) |- ! Ribbed Repp Chile 1870 5c reprint on ribbed paper Ribbed paper or Repp paper describes the texture created by paper-making rollers that have fine corrugations cut into them. Ribbed paper can be confused with paper with heavy laid lines as their appearance when held to a light is similar. One way to determine if the paper is ribbed is to run your finger over the surface of the stamp, since ribbing is not a watermark but a texturing of the surface of the stamp. * Afghanistan SC#146-153 * Poland SC#81-92 |- ! Safety or Security See Security paper gallery below This is the large group of paper that describes the many varieties of paper used to prevent the reuse of a postage stamp. Included in this group are: :* Double paper, e.g. invented by C F Steel :* Paper with colored dots :* Chalk paper :* Burelage or network paper :* Bank check paper * Venezuela SC#293-304 (Bank check paper) * El Salvador SC#414-421 (Paper with colored dots) * Danzig SC#117-125 (Network paper) * Denmark SC#1-2 (Burelage) * Ceylon SC#207-218 (Chalky) |- ! Silk ↔ When short uncolored silk fibers are added to the furnish, the paper is designated as silk paper. Silk paper is often confused with silk-thread paper (next entry). Silk paper was used for some U.S. revenue stamps. - ! Silk thread Closeup of the red thread embedded in the paper of Switzerland's 1855 10 Rappen stamp John Dickinson patented silk-thread paper in 1830 for bank notes and later adapted the technology for stamps. Dickinson paper is the trade name for this paper and was used by Switzerland and Bavaria. Passing paper is a particular type silk thread paper that was manufactured in Pasing, Bavaria and used in Bavaria's stamps between 1849 and 1868. * Bavaria SC#2-14 * Great Britain SC#5-7 * Switzerland SC#14-31 |- ! Silkote Silkote paper Silkote is the trade name given to the paper that had optical brighteners added to the furnish. It was an experimental issue that was tested in the Westbrook substation in Maine, U.S. during the Christmas of 1954. * U.S. SC#1033a |- ! Tagged ↔ A paper to which a luminescent additive was added to the furnish to facilitate the automation of the facing and canceling operation. Also paper with a luminescent coating. * U.S. SC#2115b (paper with additive) * Deutsche Bundespost since 1961 (fluorescent coating) |- ! Toned ↔ Paper that is off-white or with a brownish or buffish tinge is called toned paper. * Cook Islands SC#1-4 * Romania SC#166-172 |- ! Watermarked Elephant head watermark used on early stamps of India A watermark is created in the paper by the mould or the Dandy roll and can be letters or designs. * India SC#19-25 * U.S. SC#264-278 |- ! Wove Wove paper as magnified from the back of the US 1890-923 2c. Notice the left to right direction of the fibers. The texture of wove paper has no discernible pattern when the paper is held up to a light. The paper is formed on a mould, unlike laid paper, that does not have wires attached to it and so the pulp forms an even web of fibers. * Brazil SC#99-108 |} Security paper gallery Examples of different security paper used on postage stamps. {- valign=\\"top\\" |Lilac network of Estonia's 1928–35 10s stamp Gray network of Danzig's 1922 6m stamp Blue Winchester security paper of Venezuela's 1932–38 25c stamp Security paper of Venezuela's 1952 1b security stamp Colored dots on El Salvador's 1907 1c stamp |} Notes and references  Citations Books * Standard Catalog of U.S. Stamps, 2003, 6th Edition Krause - Minkus * Stephen R Datz, Official Stamp Collector's Bible 2003 * Rodney A Juell and Steven J Rod, Encyclopedia of United States Stamps and Stamp Collecting 2006 * Josep Asunción, The Complete Book of Papermaking (Lark Books, 2001) * Arnold Grummer, Complete Guide to Easy Papermaking (Krause Publications, 1999) Websites * How a Postage Stamp is Made * Calvet M Hahn, The Topic is Paper 2002 Further reading * Earland, Christopher.

Plot Before Winter Comes takes place in the immediate aftermath of World War II. British Major Giles Burnside (David Niven) is assigned to an refugee camp in occupied Austria; his mission is to send the groups of displaced civilians to either the Russian zone or the American zone. Burnside is a by-the-book officer but he runs into trouble with the translation of the many different languages. However, one of the refugees, Janovic (Topol), can speak many languages and is willing to help. Janovic quickly conveys Burnside's orders and helps the camp run smoothly. Janovic runs into romance with a lovely innkeeper, Maria (Anna Karina), until he discovers her affair with Burnside.

It ran from September 7, 1980, to September 27, 1981, on Fuji TV. Twelve-year-old Rin Yuki loyally supported his father when the world laughed at the scientist for saying that Earth was about to be invaded from outer space. But Rin did not expect to become personally involved—until he met Takoro, the strange young \\"deputy sheriff\\" from another world who was on the trail of notorious space criminals. There were only four Kurodako Brothers, but they plotted to use their alien science and natural shape-changing powers to become the secret masters of Earth. With Takoro's help, Rin became the mighty super-hero, Muteking, to foil their schemes. The series was televised in Italy under the title of simply Muteking. An English dub of episode one was also made, apparently in an unsuccessful attempt to sell the series to the United States. In this one-episode dubbed version (which has been posted on YouTube in three parts), Rin Yuki is named \\"Scooter Loon,\\" and his father is renamed \\"Linus Loon.\\" In 2019, Tatsunoko announced a reboot of the series titled Muteking the Dancing Hero that will air in 2020.

The two species are very similar to each other: about long, with long necks and fairly long yellow bills. Adults are black and chestnut-brown, with pale yellow-green flight feathers that contrast conspicuously when a bird flies. Their legs are long and grayish, and as in all jacanas, their toes are extremely long for walking on aquatic vegetation such as lily pads. They have frontal shields (like those of coots) and wattles; differences in these are the most noticeable differences between the species. Juveniles are brown above and white below, with a buff-white stripe above the eye and a dark stripe behind it. The dark colors are somewhat darker on the juvenile wattled jacana than on the northern. Together the species occur in marshes in the American tropics and subtropics. The northern jacana's range meets that of the wattled jacana in western Panama. As in most other jacanas, males build the nests, incubate, and brood the chicks. Both these species are polyandrous, at least in some circumstances. Females lay separate clutches (of four eggs) for up to four mates, each of which tends his clutch alone. The genus Jacana was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 with the wattled jacana (Jacana jacana) as the type species.

Released by Grand National Pictures, it is the first of eight films based on Renfrew of the Royal Mounted, a popular series of boy's adventure books written by Laurie York Erskine. The film was shot on location at Big Bear Lake, California. Plot Lightning in Renfrew of the Royal Mounted In the summer of 1937, a dangerous gang of counterfeiters are transporting illegal money from the United States into Canada concealed inside frozen trout. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police assures the United States Treasury officials that they will cooperate fully in helping to apprehend the criminals. RCMP Constable MacDonald is sent out to assist in the investigation. While riding near Deer Lake, he sees a suspicious Indian rowing a canoe. When he calls to him, the Indian flees into the woods. MacDonald investigates the strange block of ice left behind and soon discovers the counterfeit money hidden inside the frozen trout. The Indian Pierre, who works for the counterfeiters, sees what has happened and kills MacDonald with a deadly throw of a knife. Meanwhile, RCMP Sergeant Renfrew (James Newill) arrives with his men at the Deer River Annual Picnic where he competes against the Greek owner of the Totem Pole Lodge George Poulis (William Royle) to see who makes the best barbecue sauce. Renfrew meets nineteen-year-old American Virginia Bronson (Carol Hughes) and invites her to join the picnic festivities and barbecue. Their fun is interrupted by news of the killing of Constable MacDonald. Later Inspector Newcomb challenges his men to do everything they can to bring the killers to justice. That night Renfrew comforts MacDonald's grieving family, especially his son Tommy (Dickie Jones). At the Deer River Hotel, Virginia returns to her room and finds Pierre, who gives her a note from her father asking that she meet him at the Totem Pole Lodge. Unknown to her, Virginia's father was tricked into coming to the lodge, which is being used as a center of operations for the counterfeiters, to provide new counterfeit plates for the gang. Bronson, who was once a counterfeiter, just returned from serving a five-year sentence in prison. The next day, while Virginia and Pierre are rowing to the lodge by canoe, the Indian spots Renfrew following them. When he reaches for his rifle, Virginia struggles to take away the gun and the two end up in the water. Renfrew jumps in after them and is able to rescue Virginia, but Pierre manages to escape. While they dry off around a campfire, Renfrew and Virginia get to know each other. While attracted to the Mountie, Virginia discovers her father's picture in his possession and does not mention that he is staying at the Totem Pole Lodge. Later that night while Renfrew is asleep, Pierre shows up and Virginia sneaks away with him to the lodge. Meanwhile, her father is being forced to complete a set of counterfeit plates. He finally meets the head of the counterfeit gang—the Greek lodge owner, George Poulis. Meanwhile, Pierre and Virginia make their way slowly to the lodge. On the road they're met by two of Poulis' thugs, and Virginia tells them they are being pursued by an officer named Renfrew. Shortly thereafter, the two thugs encounter Renfrew and try to kill him, but the Mountie and his trusted dog Lightning are able to disarm the criminals and arrest them. When Renfrew examines their new counterfeit bills, he discovers a secret message from Bronson etched in the bill's design indicating that he is being held prisoner at the Totem Pole Lodge. Soon after, Renfrew obtains an aircraft, flies over the Totem Pole Lodge, and parachutes down to the lodge property. Poulis is surprised to see his \\"friend\\" and offers him a room. Later when Renfrew sees suspicious men loading up a car with blocks of ice, he chases after them on motorcycle. When the car crashes, the Mountie discovers the frozen trout filled with counterfeit bills. Back at the lodge, Renfrew and Poulis finally confront each other, and in the ensuing gunfight, Poulis is shot and taken under arrest. That night on moonlit Deer Lake, Renfrew serenades Virginia in a canoe while his trusted dog Lightning looks on.

The biography was written by Professor P. S. Chandraprabhu in 1991. A new edition of the book was published in March 2012. Iyer was dedicated to the freedom movement and helped socially depressed people as well as the people of his constituency. He did not participate in the election in 1952 because he was getting too frail. In his final days, even the best medical procedures couldn't save him. Every year, on Iyer’s death anniversary (February 23), people pay respect to him by garlanding a statue of him. Every year on that day, respects are paid to his memorial at the Chennai Thakkar Baba Vidyalaya School and the Madurai ‘Sevalayam’, which was started by Iyer in 1932 to serve Harijans. Vaidyanatha Iyer died in 1955. A postage stamp was issued in his memory by the Government of India on 9 December 1999.  References   Publications  *  External links  * Madurai A.

It is based on the sun4m architecture, and is enclosed in a lunchbox chassis. Specifications CPU support The SPARCstation Classic incorporates a single 50 MHz microSPARC processor.  Memory  The SPARCstation Classic has three banks with two DSIMM slots each. The official maximum configuration uses 16MB modules, but the first bank can also hold 32MB modules giving a maximum of 128Mb memory.  Disk drives  The SPARCstation Classic can hold one internal 3.5-inch 50-pin, single ended, fast-narrow SCSI drive and a floppy. It also supports external SCSI devices. There is no IDE/ATAPI support. Network support The SPARCstation Classic comes with an on-board AMD Lance Ethernet chipset providing 10BaseT networking as standard and 10Base2 and 10Base5 via an AUI transceiver. The OpenBoot ROM is able to boot from network, using RARP and TFTP. Like all other SPARCstation systems, the SSC holds system information such as MAC address and serial number in NVRAM. If the battery on this chip dies, then the system will not be able to boot. Operating systems The following operating systems run on a SPARCstation Classic: *SunOS 4.1.3c onwards *Solaris 2.3 Edition II to Solaris 9 *Linux - Some but not all distributions still support this sparc32 sub- architecture *NetBSD/sparc32 *OpenBSD/sparc32  Differences between Classic and LX  The SPARCstation Classic was designed to be an entry-level workstation with a lower price point than the SPARCstation LX; it has a lower- end CG3 framebuffer rather than the LX's accelerated CG6. The SPARCclassic also features 8-bit audio as opposed to 16-bit audio for the LX. The motherboards of the two systems are otherwise similar, and both use the same chassis.

Military career Macdonald is claimed to be a World War II veteran of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and Fleet Air Arm, however, details of said service are unknown. Career diplomat and advocate Macdonald served as Canada's senior trade commissioner in Sri Lanka, the United States of America, and Lebanon in the 1970s.Mike Haymes, \\"Arson suspected on ex-KKK adviser's land: Supremacist scoffs at idea fire connected to reputation, past activities,\\" Ottawa Citizen, 18 March 2005. As President of the Iraqi-Canadian Friendship Association in the 1990s, he spoke at conferences in Montreal, Moscow and Baghdad opposing the sanctions and the use of depleted uranium munitions against Iraqi civilians. In 1984, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigated allegations that Macdonald had given confidential Canadian trade documents to the government of Iraq. Associations In 1987, Macdonald, who had business dealings with Libya since 1970, was asked by Palestinian-American Mousa Hawamda, a Libyan agent, to organise a Canadian delegation to Tripoli to commemorate the American bombing of Libya the previous year. Macdonald agreed and recruited a contingent of 96 members, among whom were representatives of the far-left and far-right.Warren Kinsella, \\"Remembering a Canadian victim of the Gadhafi regime,\\" Calgary Sun, 28 August 2011, p. 28. In March 1989, he and Ingrid Beisner organized a sold-out speaking engagement for controversial author David Irving at the Chateau Laurier in Ottawa. In September of that year, author Warren Kinsella wrote an article titled \\"The Somewhat Right of Centre Views of Ian Verner Macdonald\\" for Ottawa Magazine. In the early 1990s, Macdonald permitted white supremacist rallies, as well as camps by neo-Nazi skinheads and Aryan Nations groups, to be held on his property. He was a friend of James Alexander McQuirter, leader of the Canadian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, in the 1980s.Stewart Bell, \\"Confessions of a Grand Wizard,\\" National Post, 23 May 2009, A10. Kinsella published the book Unholy Alliances in 1992 and devoted Chapter 5 of the work to detailing his allegations about Macdonald's personal views. He also wrote Web of Hate in 1994, and accused Macdonald of being a \\"fascist\\" and \\"anti-Semite\\", claiming that Macdonald's friendship with McQuirter linked Irving to the KKK. In 1992, Ottawa's Frank Magazine described Macdonald as a \\"neo-nazi\\" landlord, which he denied. In 1996, Kinsella took part in a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) radio call-in program wherein he stated that Macdonald \\"provided rhetorical and material support to the Canadian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, and ... provided connections between Ku Klux Klan leaders and the Government of Libya.\\" Kinsella also stated that the Libyan government \\"provided funding to far right groups in Canada to carry out illegal acts.\\" Macdonald subsequently engaged litigation lawyer Doug Christie to sue the CBC and Kinsella for libel. The case was dismissed on the grounds that the statements were not defamatory and that the claim was filed more than six weeks after the broadcast. The presiding justice wrote, \\"It is clear from the evidence that Macdonald was known for his anti-Semitic, racist views and friends, and for being at least an admirer of the KKK. Nothing that Kinsella said affected that reputation. Nothing he said alluded to any criminality.\\"Kristy Nease, \\"Liberal strategist Kinsella defeats defamation suit; Ex-diplomat had established 'anti-Semitic, racist views,' judge rules,\\" Ottawa Citizen, 21 July 2009, C3.

They are thus a hazard to railways and road traffic.  Overview  The biggest danger with washaways is that they may be difficult to spot in time to stop short of the point where one falls over the edge and/or into the water where one may drown.  Repairs  An embankment that is washed away can be repaired or restored by replacing the washed away earth, which is necessarily large because embankments have a gentle slope. A quicker method is to replace the washed out earth with a criss-cross structure of timber steepers called a pigsty which is only slightly wider than the track itself. The pigsty has alternating layers of transverse and longitudinal layers of these sleepers, which contains a lot of air which saves weight. Steel and concrete sleepers are not necessarily suitable for this purpose as they are either not square or fragile. The sleepers in the pigsty can be reused when the washaway is fully repaired. Rails can substitute for the sleepers. The hollow space inside the pigsty should be able to act as a culvert.  Warning devices  A mechanical railway signal that is normally \\"green\\" can be put to \\"red\\" if a link in the pulling wire is disengaged by a slump of the earth beneath. An electrical railway signal that is normally green can be put to red if a contact is opened circuited by a slump of the earth beneath. One side of contact might be attached to the sleepers, while the other side is buried in the ballast beneath. To protect against a false feed keeping the warning signal green, the circuit should be double cut so that false feeds will connect positive to negative and blow a fuse, forcing the warning signal to red. A similar setup might be used to protect bridges likely to be hit by ship collisions, as with the 1993 Big Bayou Canot train wreck.  Accidents  Railway accidents involving bridge washaways include: * 27 September 1923 – near Glenrock, Wyoming - a bridge over Coal Creek was washed away and a passenger train derailed, killing 30 of the train's 66 passengers. * 24 December 1953 - Tangiwai disaster - lahar caused bridge washaway; train thrown into river; 151 killed. * 1974 - Crystal Brook, South Australia - train thrown into river after washaway collapses bridge. * 1993 - 114 perished in a passenger train that plunged into a river after floods washaway a bridge at Ngai Ndethya. * 29 October 2005 - Veligonda train disaster - 114 killed * November 2011 - Feroleto-Marcellinara, Italy Today's Railway Europe 213, pg 55  Cause unclear  * Peruman railway accident 1988 - 105 killed  See also  * List of rail accidents * Washout  References   External links  Category:Landslide types Category:Traffic collisions Category:Railway accidents and incidents ","title":"Washaway"},{"id":"23988883","text":"The Panther's Claw is a 1942 American film directed by William Beaudine. A Producers Releasing Corporation picture. It is a loose sequel to two Columbia Pictures films of the 1930s The Night Club Lady and The Circus Queen Murder which had featured Adolphe Menjou as Thatcher Colt.  Plot summary  Police see Digberry climbing over a wall, out of a graveyard at one a.m. He has left a thousand dollars inside on a grave, as ordered in a letter he received. The money is now gone. They take him to headquarters. He reveals the letter came from “the Panther” and is now believed as others have had letters from the same character and Digberry meets a group of them. They all got typewritten letters demanding a thousand dollars too but unlike him they consulted the police. The group all turn out to be connected (Digberry makes wigs). Baritone, Enrico Lombardi looks to be a possible candidate so the Commissioner orders him brought in. Lombardi tries to force himself on Nina Politza and hits Digberry who intervenes, for bringing him into this affair. Nina is reported as sailing on a ship to Buenos Aires, as planned. Digberry receives a call and goes out. While out, the police are let into his apartment and try his typewriter to see if the “H” matches that on the Panther's letters and if his cat's inked paw is the same mark as on the letters. They are in both cases. Digberry returns and is taken to headquarters. Digberry now tells the Commissioner he wrote the letter to blackmail himself to cover up from his wife and five (grown up) daughters the thousand dollars he drew out of his account but refuses to say what it was for. Meanwhile, a woman has been found murdered in his apartment block and next to her is a signed picture of Digberry. Investigation reveals that the dead woman, wearing a gray wig, is Nina. Digberry's unlikely alibi is that he was waiting on a street corner as per a phone call he had received. Orders go out to pick up Nina's ex-husband and Lombardi and the Commissioner follows up a wig lead Digberry gave him, about gray hair found from an inferior wig to the kind Digberry makes. The wig maker, Wilkins tells him it could be from a wig he made for Galloway or for Lombardi. Captain Walters (Captain because he served in France in WWI) who managed Nina, offers a thousand dollar reward for the capture of her murderer. A report is given that Lombardi is out of town and no such person as Galloway or the address given the wig maker exists. Wilkins is to be at the police station next morning to see if he can recognise who bought the second gray wig from a list of suspects. Lombardi is finally caught, and has a gun with one shot fired. That night, Wilkins is shot and killed to stop him identifying a possible murderer. Digberry's apartment is searched and a missing insurance policy found, signed over to him, worth $20,000. The murder weapon, put in one of his drawers by an unseen person is found too. Digberry returns and explains to the Commissioner that he loaned her the thousand dollars because though everyone thought she was well off, she was broke. She signed the insurance over to him as surety. She could not afford to go away as before, so got off the ship before it sailed and planned to stay in town in disguise (the wig, etc.) as the knowledge that she had no money could have hurt her career. Digberry is off to headquarters again where the Commissioner finally reveals all and the villain is taken away to jail. The name of the killer is on the \\"discussion\\" page.

Family  Marullinus came from a well-established, wealthy and aristocratic family of Praetorian rank in the gens Aelia. His mother is unknown and his father was a Roman senator called Publius Aelius Hadrianus Marullinus, also the name of his paternal grandfather and paternal great-grandfather. The paternal ancestors of Marullinus had descended from Picenum (modern Marche and Abruzzo, Italy). They were originally Centurions who participated in the Punic Wars possibly under the general Scipio Africanus. About 205 BC, at the end of the Second Punic War, the paternal ancestors of Marullinus left Picenum and settled in Italica (near modern Seville, Spain) in the Roman Province of Hispania Baetica. The paternal great-grandfather of Marullinus, Publius Aelius Hadrianus Marullinus, was admitted into the Roman Senate by Octavian (future Emperor Augustus) when he served as a member of the Second Triumvirate between 43 BC and 33 BC. He was the first person in his family to become a senator, however the circumstances leading him to be admitted into the senate are unknown. Nevertheless, Marullinus was one of the few Romans that came from the provinces that Octavian had ever admitted into the Senate.  History  Marullinus was born and raised in Italica, but spent various amount of time in Rome. He married a noblewoman from Italica called Ulpia, who was a sister to the Roman general and senator Marcus Ulpius Traianus, the father of Emperor Trajan. Ulpia and Marullinus had at least one child, a son called Publius Aelius Hadrianus Afer, who would become a distinct soldier and politician. Hadrianus Afer would marry Domitia Paulina and would have two children: Aelia Domitia Paulina (75–130) and Publius Aelius Hadrianus (76–138). Hadrianus was adopted by Trajan as his heir and eventually succeeded him as Emperor Hadrian. Marullinus had a reputation in practising astrology and had predicted by the stars, that his grandson would rule as Roman Emperor. When Hadrian ruled as Roman Emperor, as a tribute to his birthplace and ancestry he created Hispania Baetica into a colony. Hadrian's second adoptive son and successor Antoninus Pius, assumed the name Aelius Hadrianus, as a part of his name when he ruled as Emperor and sixth child born to Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius and Roman Empress Faustina the Younger was named Hadrianus. The prince Hadrianus (152–157) was named in honor of his grandson Hadrian and is a tribute to his family.

It is a private diocesan school that educates to secondary level. Maryknoll is located in the south-eastern coast of Davao, serving the community of Lupon, Davao Oriental and surrounding town of Banaybanay and San Isidro. It is 130 kilometers away from Davao City. Brief history Maryknoll High School of Lupon is a prelature secondary school in the south-eastern coast of Davao, serving the community of Lupon, Davao Oriental and the surrounding town of Banaybanay and San Isidro. It is 130 kilometers away from Davao City. The school was founded in 1960 by American missionary Fr. James Ferry of the Maryknoll Fathers. He named the school, St. Patrick’s High School. It initially started with four classrooms and 115 students. Through his efforts and the generous donations from his friends abroad, three offices and a stage were added to the original building with four classrooms. Fr. Ferry was the first director of the school and Miss Elisa Santos, the first principal. She ran the school for four years and saw the first graduation of 31 students. The Maryknoll Sisters assumed the administration of the school in July 1964. With the coming of the American Maryknoll Sisters, the progress of the school became rapid. The years within 1968 -1977 with Sister Loretta Harriman, MM as principal, witnessed the progress and growth of the school. Through her efforts, a spacious library and a laboratory were constructed for the benefit of the growing population. Good academic instruction and firm discipline became distinctive competencies of the school. Enrollment increased to 600 in the early 70s but the opening of Lupon Municipal High School and the Lupon Vocational High School less than a kilometer away from the school, reduced the enrollment considerably. Added to this factor was the growing unrest of the people due to the peace and order condition in the area. The school year 1975-1976 was a period of transition in the administration of the school. The Maryknoll Sisters’ policy of phasing out from schools in the Philippines took effect and the administrative functions in school were left to layman. Between the years 1976-1978, rapid succession of three lay principals took place. In 1978 the administration of Maryknoll High school of Lupon was handed over to the Dominican Sisters of the Most Holy Rosary of the Philippines, with Sister Mary Epifania Brasil, O.P. as principal. The sisters responded to the invitation of Msgr. Joseph Regan, MM Bishop of Tagum to administer the school left by the Maryknoll Sisters to the Filipino Administrators. Sister Brasil showed great concern and involvement towards the improvement of the school facilities, buildings as well as the development of the faculty members and the students. In 1984 the administration was assumed by another Dominican Sister, Sr. Ma. Antonina Paguntalan, O.P., with all the efforts and interest to go on the mission to improve the school and its facilities, she made additional projects for the benefit of the whole student body. In 1989 the school was run by another sister of Dominican Order, Sr. Mary Visitacion Nuñez, O.P.. During her first two years at Maryknoll, she has contributed other improvements In school such as the construction of the additional classroom, guest room, and the installation of intercom in every classroom as part of communication gadgets and renovation of offices. After three years, in 1992, Sister Ma. Teofila Frondozo, O.P. assumed office as a new principal of Maryknoll School of Lupon. Under her administration, the school began to offer computer to the students, construction of a four-door school dormitory, and construction of back fence which collapsed due to flash flood. In June 1996 another Dominican Sister, Sr. Ma. Evelyn M. Oqueza, O.P. took over the administration. Improvements and renovations were made such as repainting of the school building, construction of carpentry shop and the completion of the reading center initiated by MOLSAC. It was in her administration that the school had changed its name from “Maryknoll High School” to Maryknoll School of Lupon and the Elementary Department was recognized by the Department of Education. In June 2000 Sister Ma. Domitilla Sendino, O.P., another Dominican Sister took over for one year. She managed the completion of Speech Laboratory and acquisition of a photo copying machine. In June 2001 the school is administered and managed by another Dominican Sister, Sister Ma. Amata I. Iturralde, O.P. until May 30, 2005. In her administration, the school enjoyed series of improvements such as acquisition of additional computer and sports equipment, renovation of Science Laboratory, restrooms, constructions of drinking water facilities (flowing), new gate, canals, new guardhouse, students’ path walk, kiosk, concretization of fence near the convent, acquisition of other equipment such as Riso Copier and Sound Systems. With the support of the PTA organization, Sr. Amata was able to realize her plans for development and maintenance of the school, enhance the skills and knowledge of its faculty and innovate school instructions. Much more, she was able to put up additional funds in the PERAA (Private Educational Retirement Annuity Association) Plan for the security of teaching and non-teaching staffs’ tenure in the school. In June 2005 Sr. Ma. Myrle P. Gudilosao, O.P, another Dominican Sister took over to manage the school. She compiled the three years institutional plan of Sr. Ma. Amata I. Iturralde, O.P.. In her administration, the school provides for the increase of number of days pay for employees from 21.8 to 30 days, in spite of the budget constraints, she was able to manage for the renovation and transfer of finance offices accessible to the parents and visitors; construction of new Guidance and Prefect of Discipline’s offices; conversion of old dormitory into function hall; tile flooring of offices and faculty room; construction of new canteen building; new faculty and students CR; acquisition of Yamaha amplifier, procurement of three brand new computer units with complete accessories for offices and faculty use, library books, new athletic and DBC equipment, library expansion with new arrangement and acquisition of brand new L-300 cab/chassis vehicle. With her inspiration, the school responded the invitation of neighboring school’s challenges in different field of endeavor in the field of Academic, Athletic and DBC competition and garnered result with flying colors. Although there were some loop holes encountered but was able to manage the situation. In the school year 2007-2008, with Sister Myrle’s leadership Maryknoll School of Lupon participated in the DCSAA (Diocesan Catholic Schools Athletic Association) held at Sigaboy, San Isidro, Davao Oriental, a neighboring town of Lupon.

The corresponding station on the Bangladesh side is Darshana. It is the terminal station on the Sealdah-Gede section of Kolkata Suburban Railway system.There is a and border checkpoint at Gede. History Gede was one of the stations on the Sealdah-Goalundo route of East Bengal Railway. With the partition of India in 1947, it became a border town. Thereafter there were three trains from Sealdah running into East Pakistan: the East Bengal Express, the East Bengal Mail and the Barisal Express. The services all ceased after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. Freight trains ran on Petrapole-Benapole, Gede-Darshana and Singhabad-Rohanpur lines off and on since 1972 after the independence of Bangladesh, and more regularly after transport agreements were signed by the two countries in the 1990s.Radhikapur-Birol section was another section for movement of goods traffic. As of 2002, the Gede-Darshana section accounted for the bulk of the exports handled by the Indian Railways (both the Eastern Railway and the Northeast Frontier Railway together) for Bangladesh. A direct train between Dhaka and Kolkata, named Maitree Express (Maitree is a Sanskrit word meaning friendship) commenced on 14 April 2008. The train is managed by Indian Railways and Bangladesh Railway. The approximate distance covered by Maitree Express is estimated at around , a stretch of in India and a stretch of in Bangladesh. The train follows the border point route at Gede- Darshana. The train runs on Saturdays and Sundays every week. Passengers of the Maitree Express are irked by the five-hour wait for immigration and customs clearance at the border stations of Darshana and Gede. Trans-Asian Railway Currently, all freight traffic originating from Asia destined for Europe goes by sea. The Trans-Asian Railway will enable containers from Singapore, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand and Korea to travel over land by train to Europe. The Southern Corridor of the Trans-Asian Railway is of prime interest to India. It connects Yunnan in China and Thailand with Europe via Turkey and passes through India. The proposed route will enter India through Tamu and Moreh in Manipur bordering Myanmar, then enter Bangladesh through Mahisasan and Shabajpur and again enter India from Bangladesh at Gede. On the western side, the line will enter Pakistan at Attari. There is a missing link on this route in the India-Myanmar sector; of this, , in India, is between Jiribam in Manipur and Tamu in Myanmar. The rail link between Jiribam and Imphal has been sanctioned by Indian Railways, but that is unlikely to be completed before 2016. At present construction work is in progress in a stretch between Jiribam and Tupul.

Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani under their banner Vijaya Vauhini Studios. Partially inspired by William Shakespeare comedy The Taming of the Shrew, Gundamma Katha is an official remake of the Kannada film Mane Thumbida Hennu (1958). It is also the first remake by Vijaya Vauhini Studios. It stars N. T. Rama Rao, Akkineni Nageswara Rao, Savitri, and Jamuna, with S. V. Ranga Rao, Suryakantham and Ramana Reddy in supporting roles. Gundamma Katha is the story of Gundamma, a rich widow who ill-treats her selfless step-daughter Lakshmi, who is reduced to working as a maid. Lakshmi dotes on Gundamma's daughter Saroja, an arrogant woman who loves Lakshmi. The film's centrepiece is formed by the way Lakshmi's suitor Anjaneya \\"Anji\\" Prasad and Saroja's lover Raja bring a change to Gundamma's life after the couples' marriages. The film is Rama Rao's 100th appearance and Nageswara Rao's 99th. It was photographed by Marcus Bartley, and co-edited by G. Kalyana Sundaram and D. G. Jayaram. Ghantasala composed the film's soundtrack and score. Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar were the film's art directors. The production phase lasted for a year; it was filmed in and around Madras, mainly on sets at Vijaya Vauhini Studios. Released on 7 June 1962, Gundamma Katha received praise for its story, screenplay and cast performances, and criticism for its poor character development. The film was commercially successful, completing a 100-day run in 17 centres and a silver- jubilee run at the Durga Kalamandir, Vijayawada. It is regarded as the last film of Vijaya Vauhini Studios' \\"Golden Age\\". The film's Tamil remake of the same year Manithan Maravillai, also produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios, had Nageswara Rao, Savitri, and Jamuna reprising their roles. Though Gundamma Katha has achieved cult status in Telugu cinema, it has received criticism for its influence on stereotypes in the narration of other unrelated Telugu films.  Plot  Gundamma is a rich widow who ill-treats her stepdaughter Lakshmi, a selfless person who is reduced to working as a maid. Gundamma has a daughter Saroja and a son Prabhakar. Prabhakar is in love with Saroja's friend Padma. Gundamma has a half-brother Ghantaiah, a cunning but weak milk vendor. Ghantaiah wants Gundamma to marry off Saroja to his criminal son Bhoopati, who is in prison. To achieve this goal without the knowledge of Gundamma, he spoils every marriage proposal Saroja receives. Saroja's arrogance and Lakshmi's courteous attitude indirectly help Ghantaiah. Gundamma decides to marry off Lakshmi to a vagabond and Saroja to the son of Ramabhadraiah, a wealthy man living in a faraway town. After observing the situations in Gundamma's house with the help of Ghantaiah, Ramabhadraiah sends his elder son Anjaneya \\"Anji\\" Prasad to Gundamma's house as a servant to get him married to Lakshmi. His younger son Raja meets Saroja through Padma, who is his cousin. Anji and Lakshmi get married, and Raja and Saroja fall in love. Ramabhadraiah writes a letter to Gundamma opposing the marriage of Raja and Saroja upon the former's instructions, and Anji conducts their marriage against Ghantaiah's wishes. Shortly afterwards, Prabhakar and Padma's marriage is conducted. Raja acts as a drunkard and masquerades as Ramabhadraiah's son seeking to gain Saroja's wealth. A rift develops between Anji and Gundamma, and he leaves with Lakshmi. Anji, Raja and Ramabhadraiah reveal the truth to Lakshmi later. Raja storms out of Gundamma's house and Saroja follows him; they join Ramabhadraiah's house as gardeners and Raja ensures Saroja is unaware of their employer. In the process, Saroja's character transforms from one of arrogance to one of a hardworking, courteous person. Gundamma is tortured by Padma's ruthless, confidence-trickster aunt Durga. Bhoopati is released from prison and Ghantaiah asks Gundamma to give some money. Because of Gundamma's arrogance, Prabhakar and Padma leave for Bangalore. Durga steals the money in the locker, accuses Gundamma of robbery and locks her in a room behind the house. Lakshmi and Anji visit Gundamma and become aware of her condition. Lakshmi and Gundamma coerce Durga and retrieve the money she stole. Bhoopati comes to Durga's rescue but is defeated by Anji in a duel and is hospitalised. Saroja meets Ramabhadraiah, her employer, and walks out after a heated argument. She meets Lakshmi on the way and learns about Raja's plans and that Ramabhadraiah is her father-in-law. The film ends with Gundamma staying with her daughters in Ramabhadraiah's house.  Cast  * N. T.

Nagi Reddy of Vijaya Vauhini Studios helped B. Vittalacharya in the production of Mane Thumbida Hennu (1958), the latter's directorial debut in Kannada cinema. As an act of gratitude, Vittalacharya sold the remake rights to Nagi Reddy. Mane Thumbida Hennu revolves around the life of a rich woman whose brother marries off her daughter to a criminal when she chooses a mentally challenged person as her step-daughter's life partner. Nagi Reddy chose to remake the film in Telugu and discussed it with D. V. Narasa Raju; it was the first time Vijaya Vauhini Studios decided to remake a film. After the script was ready, Nagi Reddy approached C. Pullaiah to direct the remake after considering B. N. Reddy. Pullaiah was not appreciative of Narasa Raju's treatment of the script and Nagi Reddy met his partner Aluri Chakrapani to develop the script further. Chakrapani decided to retain only the background of Gundamma's family from the original and rewrote the remaining script, taking inspiration from William Shakespeare comedy, The Taming of the Shrew. Chakrapani killed the character of Gundamma's cowardly husband because he felt that a husband who cannot answer his wife's questions was not eligible for inclusion. Kamalakara Kameswara Rao was chosen to direct the film. Chakrapani named the central character Gundamma in the remake after one of the characters in the original, despite a lack of nativity. Nagi Reddy's family members and the employees of the Vijaya Vauhini Studios used to ask him \\"Gundamma Katha Entha varaku vachchindi?\\" (What is the progress in Gundamma's story?), which prompted Nagi Reddy to title the film Gundamma Katha after considering various options. Marcus Bartley was recruited as the director of photography; G. Kalyana Sundaram and D. G. Jayaram edited the film. Ghantasala composed the soundtrack and score. Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar were the film's art directors. M. Pithambaram and T. P. Bhaktavatsalam provided the make-up.  Casting  Suryakantham was chosen to play Gundamma and Chakrapani suggested Kameswara Rao not to make any special efforts to make her character look ruthless because Suryakantham had an aggressive body language. N. T. Rama Rao and Akkineni Nageswara Rao were chosen as the male leads Anjaneya \\"Anji\\" Prasad and Raja, making Gundamma Katha their 10th film together; the film was Rama Rao's 100th film as an actor and Nageswara Rao's 99th. Savitri and Jamuna were chosen as the female leads Lakshmi and Saroja, respectively. Saroja was created by Chakrapani for the film, taking cues from The Taming of the Shrew. S. V. Ranga Rao, Ramana Reddy and Rajanala Kaleswara Rao were cast in the supporting roles of Ramabhadraiah, Ghantaiah and Bhoopati. Haranath and L. Vijayalakshmi were chosen to play Gundamma's son Prabhakar and daughter-in-law Padma, while Chhaya Devi appeared as Padma's aunt Durgamma.  Filming  The production phase of Gundamma Katha lasted nearly a year, with one of the reasons being that both Rama Rao and Nageswara Rao had delays in giving bulk dates for the project. A house set was erected in Vijaya Vauhini Studios, Madras (now Chennai) where scenes featuring Gundamma and other key characters were filmed. C. Kuppuswami Naidu and K. Srinivasan supervised the erection of sets. The film's shooting was severely affected by scheduling conflicts; Chakrapani would make telephone calls to all the key artistes, and sequences were filmed based on their availability. The filming of the song \\"Kolo Koloyanna\\" was significantly affected by this; all four lead actors were supposed to take part in the song's shoot; the film's editor took care to ensure a smooth flow in the sequences during the post-production phase. The scene before the song that features Anji and Raja communicating with whistles was conceptualised by Narasaraju. Harbans Singh supervised the film's special effects. Since Vijayalakshmi was a trained dancer, an elaborate dance sequence with no connection to the film's story was introduced as a stage performance and Nageswara Rao, Jamuna, and Haranath were made to sit along with the audience. The song \\"Prema Yatralaku\\" was filmed in the gardens near the Vijaya Vauhini Studios after abandoning plans to film it in either Ooty or Brindavan Gardens, Srirangapatna. During the film's shoot, a kickboxing tournament was held in Madras; this inspired Chakrapani and Kameswara Rao to add a fight sequence between Rama Rao and Kaleswara Rao. Pasumarthi Krishnamurthy conducted the choreography for the song sequences. The film was processed at Vijaya Laboratory and was recorded on Western Electric equipment. Its total length was approximately in 18 reels, with a running time of 166 minutes.  Themes  The song \\"Aligina Velane Choodali\\" describes the life of Krishna as a child and an adult from a woman's point of view. Gundamma Katha is based partially on William Shakespeare's play The Taming of the Shrew. It focuses on a widow named Gundamma and her two daughters. The film's main theme is the step- daughter Lakshmi facing problems because of the widow, and the former's suitor teaching the latter a lesson. Using the first conversation between Gundamma and Lakshmi, in which the former abuses the latter for disturbing her sleep, Narasaraju introduces Gundamma's mindset and behaviour. Further incidents include the dismissal of a server fired from a hotel after refusing to work as a servant in Gundamma's house, and Ghantaiah explaining Gundamma's character to Ramabhadraiah. According to Filmfares V. V. S. R. Hanumantha Rao, true friendship is the theme of the film. Most of the film's dialogue, especially that between Ramana Reddy and Allu Ramalingaiah, are satirical and provide references to Indian society during the 1960s. The song \\"Lechindi Nidra\\" is about the empowerment of women and their role in areas of the government. In her article \\"Manifestation of devotion\\" about the importance of the Krishna Janmashtami festival, Rajeswari Kalyanam of The Hans India said the lyrics and photography of the song \\"Aligina Velane Choodali\\" recall the romantic side of Krishna that every woman sees in her husband or the person she loves. It also recalls the bond Krishna shared with his foster mother Yashoda.  Music  The official soundtrack of Gundamma Katha was composed by Ghantasala; it consists of eight songs whose lyrics were written by Pingali. The sound mixing process was supervised by A. Krishnan and V. Sivaram, and the soundtrack was processed by N. C. Sen Gupta. Ghantasala provided vocals for Rama Rao and Nageswara Rao; P. Susheela and P. Leela provided the vocals for Savitri and Jamuna. The song \\"Entha Hayi\\" was composed using the Mohanam raga. The soundtrack was marketed by HMV; it was successful and all eight songs were well received. \\"Lechindi Nidra\\", \\"Kolu Koloyanna\\", \\"Aligina Velane Choodali\\", and \\"Prema Yatralaku\\" achieved cult status in Telugu cinema, particularly for their lyrics. M. L. Narasimham of The Hindu noted that all songs from the film \\"are being enjoyed even today by music lovers.\\"  Release  Gundamma Katha was released on 7 June 1962. In the opening credits, images of the film's cast were used instead of their names; the leads and Ranga Rao's images are screened first, and are followed by those of Suryakantham and the other supporting cast. Gundamma Katha was a profitable venture for Vijaya Vauhini Studios; it completed a 100-day run in 17 theatres across Andhra Pradesh, and completed a silver-jubilee run at the Durga Kalamandir, Vijayawada. It became the first film to be run for 100 days with three screenings per day in Hyderabad. The silver-jubilee celebrations were not held, and the planned budget for the event was donated to a fundraiser who was active during the Sino-Indian War.  Reception  Upon release, many critics praised Gundamma Katha for its story, screenplay and performances of the lead cast, while some criticised its poor character development. Krishnanand, writing for Andhra Patrika on 15 June 1962, praised Suryakantham's role in particular and said, \\"Justifying the film's title, the makers have placed utmost importance on Gundamma's character, and Suryakantham who breathe life into that character, has equally mesmerized the audience with her performance.\\" On the same day, an article from Zamin Ryot opined that the film was filled of humour, \\"The screenplay, each and every scene, and every character in the story is purposefully made for humour; Humour in anger, humour in brawl humour everywhere!\\" it stated. Earlier on 8 June, a critic from Andhra Jyothi praising the film, wrote, \\"This isn't Gundamma's story, rather the story we see everyday Our story.\\" In an essay by V. Chakravarty writing for Eenadu in 2012, it was expressed that the characters played by Jamuna and Suryakantham were poorly written and under-developed. Chakravarty also found the characters played by Haranath and Vijayalakshmi out of place. Similar views were expressed after a special screening at L. V. Prasad residence but Chakrapani was confident of the film's success when he saw children clapping in response to Rama Rao's performance in comical sequences. Narasimham wrote in his review of the film for The Hindu in 2016, \\"With more emphasis on banter in the story, the actors, without straining a nerve, sailed smoothly through their characters.\\"  Remakes  Gundamma Katha was remade in Tamil as Manithan Maravillai (1962) by Vijaya Vauhini Studios. Chakrapani directed the remake and Gemini Ganesan replaced Rama Rao, while Nageswara Rao, Savitri and Jamuna reprised their roles. Manithan Maravillai was Nageswara Rao's 100th film as an actor; Gundamma Katha became a notable film for both Rama Rao and Nageswara Rao as they completed 100 films as actors with two versions of the same film. Unlike the original film, Manithan Maravillai was a commercial failure. Vijaya had also planned to remake Gundamma Katha in Hindi, but this plan never came to fruition. Rama Rao's son Nandamuri Balakrishna and Nageswara Rao's son Akkineni Nagarjuna, who established themselves as actors in Telugu cinema, planned to remake Gundamma Katha but withdrew after failing to find a suitable replacement for Suryakantham. In 2012, D. Ramanaidu planned to produce the remake of the film with Rama Rao's grandson N. T. Rama Rao Jr. and Nagarjuna's son Naga Chaitanya playing the leading male characters but the plans were cancelled. In April 2016, Mohan Babu expressed interest in remaking the film with his son Vishnu Manchu and Raj Tarun in the lead roles. He added that G. Nageswara Reddy would direct the remake which he would announce after acquiring the rights.  Sequel and digitisation plans  After Gundamma Katha release, Chakrapani wrote a story named \\"Gundamma Gari Kootulla Katha\\" (The Story of Gundamma's Daughters). It was serialised in Bharathi magazine. Its plot involves Ghantaiah creating a rift between Lakshmi and Saroja. Readers expected Chakrapani to produce a sequel to Gundamma Katha but he showed no interest. In 1982, Rama Rao and Krishna acted in a film, Vayyari Bhamalu Vagalamari Bhartalu, whose story resembled \\"Gundamma Gari Kootulla Katha\\". In November 2007, a Hyderabad-based company named Goldstone Technologies acquired the film negative rights to 14 Telugu films produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios, including Mayabazar (1957) and Gundamma Katha, to release colourised, digitally remastered versions. The remastered and colourised version of Mayabazar, released in January 2010, was commercially successful but Goldstone Technologies decided not to remaster the remaining 13 films, including Gundamma Katha, saying most of the producers who sold the rights to the negatives to television channels lost control over them. Goldstone further explained that a number of legal issues over ownership and copyright issues arise whenever producers try to do something on their own.  Legacy  Gundamma Katha is regarded as the last film of Vijaya Vauhini Studios' \\"Golden Age\\". In commemoration of the Centenary of Indian Cinema, The Hindu listed Gundamma Katha, Pathala Bhairavi (1951), Missamma (1955), Mayabazar, Maduve Madi Nodu (1965), Ram Aur Shyam (1967), Julie (1975), and Shriman Shrimati (1982) as the iconic films produced by Nagi Reddy. Gundamma Katha is a notable film in the careers of Suryakantham and Ramana Reddy; Nagi Reddy said the latter played a key role in the film's success. Various words and phrases, such as \\"dush propaganda\\" and \\"alludirikam\\" (Mother-in-law staying at son-in- law’s house), later became part of Telugu vernacular. In an interview with The Hindu in December 2005, Telugu actor Mallikarjuna Rao cited the film and Mayabazar as examples of incidental comedy, arguing that the situation and the subject should go \\"hand in hand\\". In May 2012, Radhika Rajamani of Rediff.com mentioned Gundamma Katha for the letter G in her list, \\"The A to Z of Telugu Cinema\\", calling it an \\"unforgettable film\\". In November 2012, The Times of India listed Gundamma Katha alongside unrelated films Missamma, Mayabazar, Narthanasala, and Bommarillu (2006) in its list of \\"Telugu classics to watch along with family this Deepavali\\". The commentator for The Times stated that Gundamma Katha \\"touches many layers of human [emotions] and situations\\" and features \\"top class actors, a strong script, melodious and meaningful songs\\". Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu (2013), which was rumoured to be a remake of Gundamma Katha, adapted the style of its opening creditsuse of images rather than text to credit its principal cast. In their 2013 book Routledge Handbook of Indian Cinemas, K. Moti Gokulsing and Wimal Dissanayake wrote that Gundamma Katha, along with Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu (1959), Missamma and Ramudu Bheemudu (1964), \\"represented the scope comedy had in the 1950s and 60s.\\" The story and treatment of Gundamma Katha inspired many other Telugu films, resulting in stereotypes in narration. The filmmaker K. V. Reddy stated that Gundamma Katha had good dialogue and production design but lacked a proper story to narrate. In her review of screenwriter Trivikram Srinivas' film Attarintiki Daredi (2013), Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu expressed hope that Srinivas \\"will give us something more innovative than relying on a story that’s been rehashed since the time of Gundamma Katha\\". In August 2015, the filmmaker Teja admitted that the Telugu film industry is stuck with two types of narratives and concepts—hero-centric films and those similar to Gundamma Katha. During the promotion of Soukhyam (2015), its director A. S. Ravikumar Chowdary said comedy is a dominant element in Telugu films, citing Gundamma Katha and Aha Naa-Pellanta! (1987) as examples.

It was established as a township by the apartheid government in 1976, but it has a long history of Indian occupation. It is associated with the Phoenix Settlement, built by Mahatma Gandhi. History The township was founded initially as a sugarcane estate.After the passing of the Group Areas Act, a law which designated specific regions for occupation by specific races, Phoenix became an Indian township. Sections were initially labelled as precincts or units, and then later renamed with proper street addresses. Places in Phoenix Until the early 1990s, Phoenix was divided into 'units' by the local government. These units have since been given street and area names, such as: * Grove End (Unit 17) * Stanmore (Unit 18) * Eastbury (Unit 7) * Southgate * Greenbury (Unit 2) * Rainham (Unit 3) * Stonebridge (Unit 4) * Centenary Park * Campbell's Town * Centenary Heights * Rockford * Clayfield (Unit 5) * Longcroft (Unit 8) * Rydalvale (Unit 9) * Brookdale * Trenance Manor * Sastripark * Palmview * Caneside (Unit 20) * Foresthaven (Unit 21) * Woodview * Sunford (Unit 15) * Redfern (Unit 10) * Whetstone (Unit 11) * Westham (Unit 12) * Lenham (Unit 13) However, many local people still refer to areas by their unit numbers.

His cartel was responsible for cocaine, marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine production, transportation and wholesaling. It controlled numerous drug trafficking corridors into the United States and was responsible for human smuggling, money laundering, extortion, kidnapping, murder, contract killing, torture, gun-running and other acts of violence against men, women, and children in Mexico. The organization was connected with the assassinations of numerous Mexican law enforcement officials. Since the mid-1990s Arturo Beltrán Leyva allegedly led powerful groups of assassins to fight for trade routes in northeastern Mexico. By 2008, through the use of corruption or intimidation, he was able to infiltrate Mexico's political, judicial and police institutions to steal classified information about anti-drug operations, and even infiltrated the Interpol office in Mexico. The Beltrán Leyva brothers, who were formerly aligned with the Sinaloa Cartel, are now allies of Los Zetas. Breakaway from the Sinaloa Cartel The Beltrán-Leyva Cartel was founded and named after the brothers Arturo, Alfredo, Alberto, Carlos and Héctor Beltrán Leyva after they separated from the Sinaloa cartel, which was led by Joaquín Guzmán Loera a.k.a. \\"El Chapo\\". Arturo Beltrán Leyva and his four brothers worked as underbosses and security chiefs for the Sinaloa cartel leaders. The breakaway from the Sinaloa Cartel was motivated by the capture of Alfredo Beltrán Leyva \\"El Mochomo\\" ('Desert Ant') by the Mexican military on January 21, 2008 which the brothers attributed to a betrayal by their boss Joaquín \\"El Chapo\\" Guzmán. After this incident, the Beltrán Leyva brothers and their lieutenants defected from the Sinaloa Cartel and allied themselves with the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas. Alfredo's influence had penetrated deep into the Attorney General of Mexico office by bribing Mexico’s former drug czar, Noé Ramírez Mandujano and other top ranking officials. Ramírez Mandujano, who was the head of the country’s top organized crime unit SIEDO, received US$450,000 per month to tip them off on the how, when and where any actions or operations against them would be taken. Kingpin Act sanction On 30 May 2008, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Beltrán Leyva under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the \\"Kingpin Act\\"), for his involvement in drug trafficking along with three other international criminals and three entities. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S. Death On December 11, 2009, in Ahuatepec, Morelos, a town bordering Cuernavaca, Arturo Beltrán Leyva held a Christmas party at a house located in one of the most luxurious gated communities in Cuernavaca. He hired artists such as Ramón Ayala, Los Cadetes de Linares and more than 20 prostitutes to entertain his guests. The Mexican Navy's elite Special Forces unit surrounded the house and tried to capture him, but in the exchange of fire he escaped. Three gunmen were killed along with an innocent bystander (a neighbor) and more than 11 bodyguards were captured. Authorities confiscated US$280,000 in cash, 16 rifles (AK-47 and AR-15), 4 pistols, 74 rifle magazines and 1,700 rounds of ammunition. Mexican Navy intelligence kept track on him and one week later, on December 16, 2009 he was traced to another luxurious apartment community where a 90-minute shootout ensued. About 200 Mexican Marines, two Navy Mil Mi-17 helicopters, from which marines rappelled, and two small Army tanks surrounded the building complex where he was hiding. Approximately 20 fragmentation hand grenades were used by Beltrán Leyva’s gunmen to keep the Navy from advancing into his position. Arturo Beltrán Leyva and three gunmen were killed; a fourth gunman committed suicide. Among the items seized by authorities during this raid, there were US$40,000 in cash, several thousand Canadian dollars, five assault rifles (AK-47 and AR-15), one pistol and several religious scapulars and medallions. Analysts said the use of navy special forces was a notable development in the drug war because they are regarded as elite fighters who operate beyond the reach of corrupting influences. The Mexican government had listed Arturo Beltrán Leyva as one of its 24 most-wanted drug lords and had offered a US$2.1 million reward for his capture. Revenge Melquisedet Angulo Córdova, the Special Forces marine who was killed during the confrontation with Arturo Beltrán Leyva, was buried with military honors on December 21, 2009. The next day, a group of gunmen assassinated members of the marine's family, including his mother. Gudiel Ivan Sanchez was later arrested in Chiapas for his alleged role as one of the gunmen in the killings. While the December 22 shootings were taking place, a \\"narcomanta\\" (banner) was placed on a kindergarten school in the state of Morelos and a section of the school was set on fire. The 'narcomanta' warned of further reprisals against anybody interfering with the cartel's affairs. In popular culture A highly fictionalized portrayal of Beltran Leyva, renamed to \\"Bernal Leyda\\", is featured in the 2017 TV series \\"El Chapo\\".

It is the oldest part of Hobart and includes many of the city's important institutions and landmarks, such as Parliament, the Supreme Court, Franklin Square, the Elizabeth Street Mall, the Royal Hobart Hospital, the Theatre Royal, State Library, the NAB Building, the Museum, and the Cenotaph. The city centre is located in the local government areas of the City of Hobart. Although the city centre is one of the oldest and most developed areas of Hobart, demographically it is one of the less densely populated areas in the greater area of Hobart, due to its core being commercial. In an attempt to create a more vibrant city at night, the state government has been encouraging inner city residential development in recent years. The population of the city centre was 456 in 2006. History Settlement of Greater Hobart spawned from the settlement of Sullivans Cove on 21 February 1804, by order of David Collins who was most unimpressed with the initial landing site at Risdon Cove. Geography The Hobart city centre draws a sense of its identity from its location between the Derwent River and the foot hills of Mount Wellington. The city is concentrated with Low-rise office buildings, interspersed by parks such as Franklin Square and St Davids Park and historic precincts such as Sullivans Cove and Salamanca Place. Due to street width, the majority of Hobart CBD's streets are One-way with a few exceptions including Elizabeth Street, the main north-south thoroughfare of the city centre. Davey Street/Macquarie travel parallel as a one-way couplet carrying traffic between Hobart's major highways along the CBD's southern fringe. The streets run on a slightly warped grid pattern in the CBD, due to early planning by Lachlan Macquarie. Governance Administratively, the Hobart City Centre falls under the authority of the local government area of the City of Hobart. The Tasmanian Government also has authority over some aspects of the CBD, in particular the major state controlled roads passing through and around the city. Commercial area With the exception of Wrest Point Casino in Sandy Bay, the Hobart CBD contains all of Tasmania’s tallest buildings, including 39 Murray Street, 188 Collins Street and the Trafalgar Building. The tallest building in the city centre is NAB House at , however planning restrictions limit future developments to a height of . There have been some exceptions to this rule such as Wellington Centre standing at and the new Royal Hobart Hospital K1/K2 Twin Towers which when complete, will stand at high. The City centre has several shopping areas including the Wellington Centre, Centrepoint and the historically significant Cat & Fiddle Arcade. During 2007, a spectacular inner city fire was responsible for the loss of one of Hobart's Myer buildings and as a result will soon see construction of the Icon Complex, boasting a 5 level Myer with specialty shops as well as a Hotel with roof top bar.

It was published by Koushinsya; later an English version was released by Viz Media in 2002. It is one in a line of her new version on old fairy tales, the others are Hansel & Gretel and Princess Mermaid. In the English book there is an interview between Izumi Evers and Junko Mizuno. Andy Nakatani has translated the interview into English. Plot An adaptation of the fairy tale \\"Cinderella\\", Cinderalla focuses on the eponymous protagonist, who works as a waitress in her father's yakitori (skewered chicken) restaurant. One day, he dies from overeating, only to rise again during the night as a zombie. Her father remarries, having fallen in love with another zombie, the ceaselessly hungry Caroline. Cinderalla's elder zombie stepsisters, Akko and Aki, only add to her workload. One day, while searching for the bra that she is making for Aki, she falls in love with a male zombie. Later, she and her mouse friend, Setsuko, rescue a starving fairy from some twin boys planning to dissect her. The fairy reveals that she cannot return to her home until she has gained her magical powers, and Cinderalla allows her to stay at her home. Eventually, Cinderalla learns that the zombie she loves is actually the Prince, a singer with an upcoming performance. Taking on part-time work, Cinderalla saves for her ticket, although she goes to buy it, she finds herself rejected because only zombies are allowed to attend. Disappointed, she returns home and becomes intoxicated with her friends. The fairy transforms her into a zombie, and joyful, Cinderalla leaves to attend the performance. While making his appearance from the ceiling, the Prince accidentally falls onto Cinderalla, causing her to lose consciousness. She awakens in a bed with him beside her, and they make love. Realizing that dawn is approaching, when the spell will wear off, Cinderalla dresses and leaves him, although she loses her right eye when she trips. While Cinderalla conceals the loss of her eye, the Prince announces his intention to marry the zombie woman whom the eye fits. The zombie women all pluck out one of their eyes, and Akko deceives the prince into believing that she is Cinderalla, although Cinderalla reveals Akko's deception with the help of Setsuko and the fairy, who now possesses all of her magical powers. Transformed into a zombie, Cinderalla marries the Prince. As Cinderalla concludes, Cinderalla has become successful with her giant fruits grown from yakitori sauce, and her husband does dinner shows at her father's remodeled restaurant. Now a celebrity, the fairy makes frequent television appearances, while Aki marries a reporter and Akko follows foreign idols. Cinderalla also buys a pancake-making machine for Caroline. Cinderalla also includes three short, related manga: \\"How Caroline Became a Glutton\\", which explores her backstory as a stripper; \\"Papa's Professional Cooking\\", which details a recipe for the fictitious sauce; and \\"Of Course We All Know\\", which focuses on the Prince's backstory in the form of lyrics. Development and release After the publication of her first major manga, the post-apocalyptic Pure Trance (1998), manga artist Junko Mizuno wrote and illustrated Cinderalla. According to Mizuno, her then-current manager, a graphic designer, and an editor had \\"wanted to make money using [her],\\" and as they thought she had no skill in creating original stories, they had wanted her to make something with a basis in older, pre-existing narratives, such as European fairy tales. She had been familiar with European fairy tales, which she read often as a child and found scary. Cinderalla was completed quickly in half a year, with no assistant. Because she did not own a computer at the time, she was unable to color the manga herself; she later expressed her unhappiness with the coloring done by Koushinsya's designer, whom she felt did not adhere to her wishes. Cinderalla did not appear as a serial in a magazine, but instead was directly published as a bound volume in Japan by Koushinsya in February 2000. Mizuno continued her fairy tale adaptations with Hansel and Gretel and Princess Mermaid. Mizuno later obtained the rights to manage the foreign editions of Cinderalla. In 2001, Cinderalla was licensed for an English-language translation in North America by Viz Media, who serialized the manga in its adult manga magazine Pulp from the May 2001 issue to the July 2002 issue. Viz Media then released a left-to-right volume of Cinderalla in July 2002. Mizuno took an active role in adapting her fairy tales for an English-language audience: she reversed the manga's original right-to-left art and subsequently redrew some pages. Envisioning \\"the feel of a cheap American comic,\\" she recolored the manga with \\"soft colors\\" and decided that it should be printed on pulp paper, in contrast to the \\"too bright and white\\" Japanese edition. Cinderalla has also been translated into French by Imho in 2004, into Portuguese by Editora Conrad in 2006, and into Spanish by Imho in 2008. Reception The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales wrote that Cinderalla contained irony and dark humor, and its ending of Cinderalla's forgiveness of her stepsisters was reminiscent of the version written by Charles Perrault. Fausto Salvadori of the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo described it as a sarcastic, bizarre and dark humor version of Cinderella that read like \\"an episode of The Powerpuff Girls written and directed by Coffin Joe\\". The dark humor was also highlighted by Rebeca Fernández of the Spanish newspaper Público who described it as union of Hello Kitty and Chucky.

He was declared to be an apostate by various Islamic scholars and by Durrani Emperor Ahmad Shah Abdali.After the death of his father in 1752, he was recommended by Nawab Safdar Jung to be appointed as Mir Bakhshi (Pay Master General) and received the titles of Amir ul-Umara (Noble of Nobles) and Imad ul-Mulk. Military career He blinded and imprisoned Emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur in 1754. In 1757, Imad invited Marathas to invade Delhi in order to drive out the Afghans and Rohillas from Delhi. In the same year, Afghanistan's Emperor Ahmad Shah Durrani declared Imad-ul-Mulk an \\"apostate\\". Two years later, Emperor Alamgir II was assassinated in 1759. He was later named the Wazir ul-Mamalik-i-Hindustan. Imad-ul-Mulk also planned the death of young Ali Gauhar and even ordered Mir Jafar the Nawab of Bengal to advance as far as Patna with the motive to kill or capture the Mughal Crown Prince. Imad-ul-Mulk soon fled Delhi after the rise of Najib-ud-Daula and the Mughal Army, which eventually places Shah Alam II as the new Mughal Emperor.

The episode revolves around Phineas Flynn and his brother, Ferb Fletcher, being told the story of how their Victorian ancestor helped a scientist create a monster. Meanwhile, Perry the Platypus is told a similar yet connected story concerning Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz's Victorian ancestor, who transformed himself into a monster. Written by Martin Olson and Jon Colton Barry, \\"The Monster of Phineas-n- Ferbenstein\\" was directed by Zac Moncrief. Malcolm McDowell and Jane Carr guest star as Ferb's grandparents, who had appeared earlier in the season in \\"A Hard Days Knight\\" and \\"The Flying Fishmonger.\\" It originally aired on Disney Channel on October 17, 2008. The episode received generally positive reviews and was nominated for the Emmy Award for \\"Outstanding Special Class – Short-format Animated Programs\\" in 2008, but the award was never given out. Plot summary In a cold opening with the theme music, Phineas (Vincent Martella) and Ferb (Thomas Sangster) warn the audience that the program will be frightening, disturbing, and horrifying. Ferb chokes up a hairball, and Phineas says \\"You've been warned.\\" When the episode officially starts, Phineas is feeling disappointed by the pouring rain and power outage, canceling his plan to stand in the middle of a field with a metal rod, until his grandfather (Malcolm McDowell) starts to tell the brothers the story of their ancestor, Ferbgor, a hunchback henchman of the Victorian era who assists Dr. Phineastein in gathering platypus body parts to create a monster and enter him in a \\"monster ball\\". Meanwhile, Perry heads over to Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc. to find out what Doofenshmirtz's current plans are, but he accidentally locks himself and Doofenshmirtz in his apartment (due to the storm that is causing Doofenshmirtz's defense system to go haywire), much to Doofenshmirtz's anger. Realizing his mistake, Perry has no choice but to make himself comfy in Doofenshmirtz's place until the power is back on. As the two nemeses sit while drinking some hot cocoa, Doofenshmirtz tells Perry the story of his Victorian ancestor, Dr. Jekyll Doofenshmirtz, who attempted to impress an angry mob by transforming himself into a beast, only to fail and become a fairy princess instead. In the grandfather's tale, Phineastein and Ferbgor construct and bring their monster to life, which frightens, then angers their castle governess, Constance, and provokes her to rally the mob against them (referencing Candace's attempts to bust her brothers). The two are unaffected by her intentions and train their beast, rather poorly, so he will be ready to participate at the monster ball. In the meantime, Jekyll rectifies the problem with his formula-making machine and transforms himself into a hulking monster. He then goes to the village to torment the citizens and cause mayhem (though it seems that he's only doing childish pranks rather that just going out on a real rampage). During his rampage, he upsets the platypus monster and is chased all over the village by him. Phineastein and Ferbgor go looking for their creation and find him thanks to an unnamed Isabella Lookalike he has ended up at the monsters' ball. Before they enter the ball, the monster viciously batters Jekyll and eats him. In the present, the power returns and Doofenshmirtz rushes Perry off to the door, telling him to come back tomorrow for his next evil scheme. Doofenshmirtz then wonders what was the conclusion to the story. In Grandpa's story, Phineastein and Ferbgor find the monster and the winner of the ball is announced: it is Constance, who has accidentally drunk Jekyll's formula and transformed into a beast, herself, and gets chased by the mob, presumed to be captured or killed. With the story concluded, Grandpa reveals that he has completely forgotten everything he has just related because of his senility. Ferb closes the episode saying that \\"platypus monsters are the only monsters to lay eggs.\\" Production Malcolm McDowell continued his portrayal of Grandpa Reginald in \\"The Monster of Phineas-n- Ferbenstein\\". \\"The Monster of Phineas-n-Ferbenstein\\" was conceived and storied by Jon Colton Barry and Martin Olson; Barry adapted it into storyboards along with Mike Diederleh. Zac Moncrief, who does the majority of directing for the series along with the show's co-creator, Dan Povenmire, directed it. The second half of the show was an episode entitled \\"Oil on Candace,\\" which followed Phineas and Ferb helping their friend Django. Malcolm McDowell and Jane Carr guest starred in the episode as Grandpa and Grandma Fletcher. Carr and McDowell had each been recurring guest stars in their respective roles; they previously appeared as the characters in \\"A Hard Days Knight\\" and \\"The Flying Fishmonger\\" and would go on to voice them in season two's \\"Elementary, My Dear Stacy.\\" \\"The Monster of Phineas-n-Ferbenstein\\" originally broadcast on Disney Channel on October 17, 2008, with a TV-G rating. The episode continued a Halloween theme started by the October 3 airing of \\"One Good Scare Ought to Do It.\\" Reception Julie Bonner of Ultimate Disney described Phineastein and Ferbgor as \\"interesting relatives\\" and that she \\"wouldn't expect anything less from [Phineas and Ferb].\\" In 2009, it was announced that \\"The Monster of Phineas-n-Ferbenstein\\" was nominated for an Emmy award in the category \\"Outstanding Special Class – Short-format Animated Programs.\\" Its sole competitor was the SpongeBob SquarePants episode \\"Dear Vikings\\". Dan Povenmire and Jeff \\"Swampy\\" Marsh, co-creators of the show and producers of the episode, were reportedly \\"thrilled\\" about the nomination and felt like they were \\"back in grade school.\\" Povenmire said he was very happy with the inclusion of the category: \\"It used to be that the Emmys would always go to shows like The Simpsons and Family Guy and just one slot saved for shows made for kids.\\" Both announced that they were very excited about competing against SpongeBob SquarePants for the award, though Povenmire did jokingly remark, \\"You’re going down, Stephen!\\" to SpongeBob SquarePants creator, Stephen Hillenburg. Povenmire also thought the nomination meant his show was attracting a widening audience. However, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences announced that they would not present the award to either of the nominees, to shock of director Moncrief.

The story takes its beginning in 1926 when Flora Trevelyan is ten years old and follows her life, and the people whose lives she touches, throughout the following thirty-five years. Plot summary In 1926 Mr and Mrs Trevelyan from England are holidaying in Brittany with their ten-year-old daughter, Flora. The two parents openly despise and neglect the young girl, who is left to occupy herself whilst they prepare to depart for a life in colonial India without her. Left to herself Flora gradually befriends the locals and the other guests at the hotel, who show her more attention and kindness than she receives from her parents. Flora soon falls helplessly in love with no less than three young men (Cosmo, Blanco and Felix) who are also staying at the hotel, and she is crestfallen when the holidays are over and they have to leave. When her parents leave for India Flora is left at a boarding school in England where she will spend the following seven years. Only once is Flora invited to spend her holidays with the Leighs, whom she met in Brittany, and in the years that follow she is only in casual contact with the Leighs and Cosmo, Blanco and Felix. When Flora is seventeen she is supposed to go to India to meet her parents who then will find her a suitable husband, but Flora decides to get off the ship in Marseilles and return to England. Back in England she has to make a living on her own and becomes a housemaid for a family in London and later in the West Country. She begins to live an independent and sensible life.

A civil servant stationed in India. * Vita Trevelyan: Flora's mother. * Angus Leigh: Retired Army man.

Themes The conflict between parents and their children is always present in Wesley's works. However, in A Sensible Life the parental neglect is extreme. The Trevelyans´ indifference towards Flora is so obvious that even the other guests at the hotel start gossiping about it: \\"One sees the child, but she is rarely with her parents...they spend their time in bed\\".Mary Wesley, A sensible Life, Vintage, UK, 2006, , p. 67. As a child Flora is understandably heartbroken and confused by her parents´ lack of interest in her. Later in life, when she has interrupted her journey to India, Flora views her parents´ indifference with calm acceptance: \\"They don´t like me...I am an impediment; they are wrapped up in each other...To be fair. I don´t like them\\".Mary Wesley, p. 274-275. Wesley's young heroines are usually expected to enter into the inevitable safe marriage, encouraged by their parents and dictated by convention. \\"We girls are not brought up to do jobs. We are brought up to marry\\".Mary Wesley, p. 175. With her modest education Flora is expected to go to her parents in India and find herself a suitable husband who can support her. As Flora's (putative) father puts it: \\"When she is seventeen we´ll get her out to India and be shot of her\\".Mary Wesley, p. 107. However, Flora's wish for independence is greater than her need for security and she interrupts her journey to India. She never sees her parents again.

The film documents the Soviet Bloc musical genre, which first appeared under Stalin and spread to Soviet-occupied Eastern Europe. The film features interviews with actors, film historians, and audience members who reminisce on these unlikely films and their impact on Soviet Bloc life. Synopsis The film first looks at Grigori Alexandrov, a director who made his career in the 1930s musicals. He directed the unlikely hit Jolly Fellows (1934), which had the backing of Maxim Gorky and the personal approval of Stalin. Alexandrov went on to create other propagandistic musicals, including Volga, Volga (1938), which details the story of peasants who boat to Moscow on the River Volga to become singers. These musicals starred his wife, Lyubov Orlova. Next, the film examines other East European musical films, concentrating on the films of East Germany's DEFA studio, including the wildly successful My Wife Wants to Sing (1958), Midnight Revue (1962), Beloved White Mouse (1964), and Hot Summer (1968). Many of the films were quite popular, but relatively few were made because their themes did not fit comfortably with the canons of Socialist realism.

According to their website, major objectives of CAWG's advocacy are: improvements in industry statistical data, funding for viticultural research, reform of federal estate tax law, and preventing misleading grape origin and varietal information on wine labels. Today CAWG represents the growers of more than 60 percent of the gross grape tonnage crushed for wine and concentrate in California. Since 1995, CAWG and the American Society for Enology and Viticulture (ASEV) have worked together to host the Unified Wine & Grape Symposium, a trade show combined with symposium held every January in Sacramento, California, United States of America.

On Sundays, it publishes as the New Hampshire Sunday News. Founded in 1863, the paper was best known for the conservative political opinions of its late publisher, William Loeb, and his wife, Elizabeth Scripps \\"Nackey\\" Loeb. Famously, the paper helped to derail the candidacy in 1972 of U.S. Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination. Loeb criticized Muskie's wife, Jane, in editorials. When he defended her in a press conference, there was a measured negative effect on voter perceptions of Muskie within New Hampshire. (See also: Canuck letter.) Over the decades, the Loebs gained considerable influence and helped shape New Hampshire's political landscape. In 2000, after Nackey's death on January 8, Joseph McQuaid, the son and nephew of the founders of the New Hampshire Sunday News, Bernard J. and Elias McQuaid, took over as publisher.  History  Like many newspapers, the Union Leader has a complex history involving mergers and buyouts. The weekly Union became the Manchester Daily Union on March 31, 1863. The afternoon Union became a morning Daily Union (dropping the \\"Manchester\\"). Although the Union began as a Democratic paper, by the early 1910s it had been purchased by Londonderry politician Rosecrans Pillsbury, a Republican. In October 1912, the competing Manchester Leader was founded by Frank Knox, later Secretary of the Navy during World War II, and financed by then-Governor Robert P. Bass, a member of the Progressive (or Bull Moose) Party who was attempting to promote the Progressive cause in New Hampshire. The newspaper was so successful that Knox bought out the Union, and the two newspapers merged under the banner of the Union-Leader Corporation July 1913. Owing to Pillsbury's role in the company, both papers espoused a moderate Republican, pro-business stance. Following Knox's death in 1944, William Loeb purchased the company, merging the Union and Leader into a single morning paper, the Manchester Union-Leader, in 1948. Under Loeb's watch, the Union-Leader moved sharply to the right. He often placed editorials on the front page and supported highly conservative candidates for public office. He dropped Manchester from the paper's masthead in the mid-1970s to emphasize the fact that it is the only statewide newspaper in New Hampshire. On April 4, 2005; it changed its name to the New Hampshire Union Leader to reflect its statewide reach. However, it is still called the Manchester Union Leader by some residents due to its historical legacy. The New Hampshire Sunday News was created in 1948 and later, after Loeb's attempts to start a Sunday edition of the Union-Leader failed, was purchased by the Union-Leader Corporation. The Union Leader still publishes the Sunday News as its Sunday edition. Two notable early employees of the New Hampshire Sunday News were Ralph M. Blagden, the first managing editor,(Archived by the Internet Archive , archived by WebCite at https://www.webcitation.org/5Ya01qMAB?url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/mcdonaldtoll.cfm) and an even more prominent journalist he mentored, Benjamin C. Bradlee. Bradlee was then a reporter(Archived by the Internet Archive , archived by WebCite at https://www.webcitation.org/5YZzX04rV) but went on to be the executive editor of The Washington Post for nearly 30 years and was its vice president until his death in 2014.

Contributors * John DiStaso * Tom Fahey Editorial style Throughout their existence, the Union Leader and its predecessors have been closely involved in state politics and during the quadrennial United States presidential election, national politics. Ever since the Loebs bought the paper, its orientation has been unyieldingly conservative (though the paper was already a reliable supporter of the GOP long before the Loebs bought it), a tradition that continued after McQuaid took over the paper. The owner-publishers have invariably made their opinions known in print, which has frequently prompted harsh criticism and accusations that the paper is used for not-entirely-journalistic purposes. Author Hunter S. Thompson referred to the Union Leader as \\"America's worst newspaper\\", claiming Sam Yorty would do well in the 1972 New Hampshire primary \\"due to his freakish alliance with the neo-Nazi publisher of New Hampshire's only big newspaper, the Manchester Union-Leader. In 2016, the Union Leader endorsed Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson for president—the first time in 100 years that the paper and its predecessors had not endorsed a Republican. In a signed editorial, McQuaid denounced Donald Trump as \\"a liar, a bully, a buffoon.\\" Cutbacks In a message printed in the paper in early 2009, publisher Joseph McQuaid announced that owing to financial difficulties affecting the entire newspaper industry, the Saturday edition of the paper would no longer be distributed outside of the Greater Manchester area and that Saturday content would be moved to a combined Friday/Saturday edition. In 2015, the paper's flagship building at 100 William Loeb Drive was subdivided into parcels and offered for lease. In 2017, the Union Leader building was sold to investor Peter Levine for $3.8 million after being on the market for about four years. The newspaper leased back space to remain in the building at 100 William Loeb Drive. Three other tenants, two of them charter schools and a distributor, also were occupying space in the building at the time of the sale.http://indepthnh.org/2017/09/16/union-leader-building-sells-for-3-8-m-in- manchester/ NewHampshire.com NewHampshire.com is a website created by the New Hampshire Union Leader in 1999 as an information portal for arts and entertainment, community news, recreation and local business information for the state of New Hampshire.

Football career Wilcock was born in Edinburgh, Scotland and from school he joined the Royal Field Artillery. He left the Army in 1909 to start his footballing career, initially with Bradford Park Avenue before joining Barnsley of the Football League Second Division in January 1910. Wilcock remained with Barnsley for two years, but made only four first-team appearances, as cover for regular goalkeeper, Jack Cooper. In 1912, he moved to Goole Town of the Midland League for a season, followed by a move to the south coast to join Brighton & Hove Albion of the Southern League in 1913. Following the outbreak of World War I, Wilcock rejoined his original military unit, the Royal Field Artillery and was seriously injured at the Battle of Loos in September 1915. As a result of his injuries, he was invalided back to England, becoming a trainer with the Army. Once he returned to fitness, he represented the Army at football and was playing in a match against the Royal Navy at Plymouth which was being watched by directors of Southampton Football Club. He was signed by Southampton in readiness for the resumption of professional football in 1919 and made his debut at Bristol Rovers on 13 December 1919, replacing Arthur Wood, retaining his place in goal for the remainder of the season. He soon \\"proved to be a very able custodian\\" and the \\"Saints\\" were approached by several of the country's top teams — although Southampton were reluctant to release him, Wilcock was sold to Preston North End of the First Division in May 1920. At Deepdale, Wilcock was used as cover for regular 'keeper, Arthur Causer, and made only seven appearances before dropping out of professional football. After a spell with Caerphilly, he returned to Southampton to take up employment in the docks. Wilcock died in Sheffield in 1962.

Breeding adults have a black head, white underparts and chequered black-and-white mantle. Non- breeding plumage is drabber with the chin and foreneck white. The main distinguishing feature from great northern loon is the longer straw-yellow bill which, because the culmen is straight, appears slightly uptilted. It breeds in the Arctic and winters mainly at sea along the coasts of the northern Pacific Ocean and northwestern Norway; it also sometimes overwinters on large inland lakes. It occasionally strays well south of its normal wintering range, and has been recorded as a vagrant in more than 22 countries. This species, like all divers, is a specialist fish-eater, catching its prey underwater. Its call is an eerie wailing, lower pitched than the common loon. Taxonomy and etymology left First described by English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1859 based on a specimen collected in Alaska, the yellow-billed loon is a monotypic species, with no subspecies despite its large Holarctic range. It is closely related to the common loon, which it strongly resembles in plumage and behaviour; some taxonomists consider the two species to be allopatric forms of the same superspecies. Both are thought to have evolved from a population of black-throated loons which colonized the Nearctic and were subsequently cut off from other populations. The genus name Gavia comes from the Latin for \\"sea mew\\", as used by ancient Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder. The specific epithet adamsii honours Edward Adams, a British naval surgeon and naturalist who sketched and collected numerous species, including this one, on several trips to the Arctic. The word \\"loon\\" is thought to have derived from the Swedish lom, the Old Norse or Icelandic lómr, or the Old Dutch loen, all of which mean \\"lame\\" or \\"clumsy\\", and is a probable reference to the difficulty that all loons have in moving about on land. \\"Diver\\" refers to the family's underwater method of hunting for prey, while \\"yellow-billed\\" and \\"white-billed\\" are references to the bird's distinctively pale bill. Description Juvenile With a length of , a wingspan of , and a weight ranging from , the yellow-billed loon is the largest member of the loon (diver) family. The adult is primarily black and white in breeding plumage, with a purple gloss on its head and neck. Habitat and range The yellow- billed loon is an Arctic species, breeding primarily along the coasts of the Arctic Ocean as far north as 78° N and wintering on sheltered coastal waters of the northern Pacific Ocean and the northwestern coast of Norway. It has been recorded as a breeding bird in Russia, Canada and the United States. Though it winters primarily to the north of 50° N, its winter range extends south to 35° N off the coast of Japan, and it has been recorded as a vagrant in more than 20 countries, including some as far south as Mexico and Spain. Behaviour Breeding Like other loons, it forms long-lasting pairs. Though it prefers freshwater pools or lakes in the tundra, the yellow-billed loon will also breed along rivers, estuaries or the coast in low-lying areas of the Arctic; in general, it avoids forested areas. Breeding typically starts in early June, though it is dependent on the timing of the spring thaw. Like all members of its family, the yellow-billed loon builds a nest of plant material very close to the edge of the water. Copulation takes place on land, without any specific courtship. The pair defends its large territory intensively against intruders, but may later in the breeding season gang up with other birds on good fishing spots. The female lays two eggs measuring . The eggs are strongly oval, and are a light purple-brown with darker blotches interspersed. This colour camouflages with the soil and vegetation that this bird nests near. Most of the time, however, the egg is not visible due to incubation, which takes around 27 to 29 days. Feeding The yellow-billed loon is a specialist fish eater, yet it also takes crustaceans, molluscs and annelids, especially for its young. It dives in pursuit of prey, which is caught underwater. Probably as a way to avoid spreading parasites, it defecates ashore, in the breeding lake. Conservation and threats In 2010, the IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) changed the status of the yellow-billed loon from Least Concern to Near Threatened, as the species appears to be in a \\"moderately rapid\\" population decline. An unsustainable level of subsistence harvesting by indigenous peoples was specifically named as the main threat. The yellow-billed loon is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies; in the Americas, it is protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.

She interviewed the deputy prime minister Nick Clegg and included contributions from Russell Brand, Tim Robbins, Simon Pegg, Oliver Stone, Tony Benn, and Julian Assange, with cover art by Anish Kapoor and Damien Hirst. According to Nick Cohen in The Observer, \\"Jemima Khan was by a country mile the best editor of the New Statesman that that journal has had since the mid-1970s\\". The magazine issue included \\"an unexpected scoop\\" from Hugh Grant who went undercover to hack Paul McMullan, a former News of the World journalist, who had been involved in hacking as a reporter. In November 2011, she joined as an associate editor of the New Statesman. Fashion In 1998, Khan launched an eponymous fashion label that employed poor Pakistani women to embroider western clothes with eastern handiwork to be sold in London and New York. Profits were donated to her husband's Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital. She ran the organisation until December 2001, when she shut down the business due to the economic situation following the September 11 attacks, and so she could focus on fundraising and on supporting her husband in Pakistani politics. In 2008 she modelled the relaunched Azzaro Couture fragrance and was a guest co-designer of a Spring 2009 collection for Azzaro, with her fee reportedly donated to UNICEF. As voted by Daily Telegraph readers, she won the Rover People's Award for the best dressed female celebrity at the 2001 British Fashion Awards. She was also featured on Vanity Fair's Annual International Best-Dressed List in 2004, 2005 and 2007, the last of which she was inducted into their Best Dressed Hall of Fame. Philanthropy During her marriage, Goldsmith established the Jemima Khan Afghan Refugee Appeal to provide tents, clothing, food, and healthcare for Afghan refugees at Jalozai camp in Peshawar. She became an Ambassador for UNICEF UK in 2001, and made field trips to Kenya, Romania, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan, the last of which she later helped victims of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake by raising emergency funds.

She has campaigned against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as for freedom of information; she attended Assange's extradition hearings and gave a speech at the Stop the War Coalition's rally in defence of Wikileaks alongside Tony Benn and Tariq Ali. Along with John Pilger and Ken Loach, she was part of the six- member group in Westminster Magistrates Court willing to post bail for Julian Assange when he was arrested in London on 7 December 2010. However, she later changed her mind about Assange, questioning his unwillingness to answer the sexual misconduct allegations which led to his arrest and what she described as his demand for \\"cultish devotion\\" from his supporters. In 2014, she publicly backed the Hacked Off campaign group which advocates reform of British press regulation. In August 2014, she was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue. On 3 November 2018, Jemima Goldsmith criticised the fact that the Government of Pakistan was considering putting the Christian woman, Asia Bibi, on the exit control list despite the fact that she was acquitted by the Supreme Court, in order to compromise with the Islamist political party Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan. Personal life Goldsmith married Imran Khan, current Prime Minister of Pakistan, a famous Pakistani cricketer, and philanthropist. They also had a civil ceremony on 21 June 1995 at the Richmond Register Office, followed by a midsummer ball at Ormeley Lodge. A few months before her wedding, she converted to Islam, citing the writings of Muhammad Asad, Charles le Gai Eaton and Alija Izetbegović as her influences. After her marriage to Khan, she relocated to his hometown, Lahore, Pakistan, where she learned to speak Urdu and also wore traditional Pakistani clothes. She wrote in a 2008 article for The Times that she \\"over-conformed in [her] eagerness to be accepted\\" into the \\"new and radically different culture\\" of Pakistan. Goldsmith stated that prior to her conversion to Islam she was technically Anglican but \\"was made familiar with Jewish traditions\\", since her paternal grandfather Frank Goldsmith was German Jewish. During her marriage, her Jewish heritage was used by Imran Khan's political opponents to question their credibility in Pakistani politics, especially concerning accusations that they supported the Jewish lobby. In 1999 she was charged in Pakistan with illegally exporting Islamic era antique tiles. She said that the charge was a fabrication to harass and damage her husband, but nevertheless left Pakistan to stay with her mother for fear of incarceration. After General Pervez Musharraf overthrew elected Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a coup d'état, in 1999, the Ministry of Culture and Archaeology verified the tiles were not antiques, and the Pakistani court dropped the charges, allowing her to return to Lahore. Goldsmith supported her husband as he became more involved in his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party. Imran became a member of Pakistan's parliament in 2002 and has been a \\"vociferous critic of President Pervez Musharraf\\". On 22 June 2004, it was announced that the couple had divorced ending the nine- year marriage because it was \\"difficult for Jemima to adapt to the political life of Imran Khan in Pakistan\\". The marriage ended amicably. Imran Khan has said the six months leading to the divorce and the six months after were the hardest year of his life. After the divorce Goldsmith returned to Britain with the former couple's two sons. According to the divorce settlement, Khan's boys visit him in Pakistan during their school holidays, and when he comes to London to see them he stays with his former mother-in-law, Lady Annabel Goldsmith. According to Jemima Goldsmith, she and Khan remain on good terms. Goldsmith has two sons from her marriage to Imran Khan: Sulaiman Isa (born 1996) and Kasim (born 1999). She retained \\"Khan\\" as her family name till December 2014 when Imran Khan married news anchor Reham Khan. On 29 December 2000, she and her family were on a British Airways jet to Kenya which was temporarily knocked off course and dived thousands of feet after a mentally ill passenger tried to seize controls in the cockpit. Her mother later said, \\"Jemima was frightened of flying even before the incident; she's petrified [now]\\". While she was married, she was described as being shy, but also modest, stylish and levelheaded. She was a close friend of Diana, Princess of Wales who visited her in Lahore in 1996. In 2002, she was listed at number 18 with £20m on the Evening Standard's young millionaires list. Following her divorce in 2004, she returned to London and later became involved in a romantic relationship with Hugh Grant. A 2005 article in the Evening Standard noted that \\"Jemima's profile\\" changed from \\"high during her first marriage\\" to \\"soaring since she became involved with Hugh Grant\\". Her relationship was scrutinised extensively by the tabloids, but a 2005 survey of London visitors favoured them as \\"the celebrity couple people would most like to show them round London\\". In February 2007, Grant announced that the couple had \\"decided to split amicably\\". Grant's spokesman added that he \\"has nothing but positive things to say about Jemima.\\" In September 2013, The Daily Telegraph reported that she was dating British activist and actor Russell Brand. In September 2014, she and Brand separated.\\"It's over: Russell Brand and Jemima Khan split\\", The Independent (Eire), 21 September 2014Eizabeth Beynon \\"No Khan do: Jemima and Russell Brand ‘split after a year’\\", The Sunday Times, 21 September 2014 References External links * Instinct Productions  UNICEF UK Ambassador Jemima Khan, official homepage at UNICEF.org.uk * Journalisted * IMDB Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of SOAS University of London Category:Alumni of the University of Bristol Category:British women journalists Category:British former Christians Category:British people of French descent Category:British people of German- Jewish descent Category:British people of Irish descent Category:British emigrants to Pakistan Category:Charity fundraisers (people) Category:Converts to Islam from Protestantism Category:Former Anglicans Jemima Jemima Category:Muslims of Jewish descent Category:Naturalised citizens of Pakistan Category:Pakistani former Christians Category:Pakistani people of Anglo-Irish descent Category:Pakistani people of English-Jewish descent Category:Pakistani people of German-Jewish descent Category:Pakistani people of French descent Category:Pakistani women journalists Category:People educated at Francis Holland School Category:People from Westminster Category:UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors ","title":"Jemima Goldsmith"},{"id":"23990177","text":"Topi is a tehsil of district Swabi in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.

These were the first systematic mass killings of German Jews during the Holocaust.Browning, Origins of the Final Solution, pp. 395–397 The question of where these killings fit into the development of the Final Solution is a matter of dispute among historians.  Background  In September 1941, the German dictator Adolf Hitler decided that the 300,000 Jews of German, Austrian or Czech nationality should be deported from Germany by the end of the year. These Jews were sometimes referred to as the Reich Jews. Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich were given the task of organizing the deportation.Browning, Origins of the Final Solution, p. 375 From 15 October 1941, when the deportations first began, until 21 February 1942, Himmler and Heydrich were able to deport 58,000 people from the Reich, mostly Jews but 5,000 Gypsies were also included. These deportations were effected by 59 transport trains, each carrying almost exactly 1,000 persons. A considerable amount of bureaucratic work was necessary to designate which Jews would be deported, arrange for their transport, and seize what property they might leave behind. Transported Jews were required to declare their assets and abandon almost everything of value.Browning, Origins of the Final Solution, pp. 375–398 While concentration camps had been in existence in Germany for some time, in September 1941, no death camps had been constructed. The destinations for these trains were instead to be several ghettos in which the Nazis had confined the Jews of Eastern Europe, whom they called the Ostjuden.Browning, Origins of the Final Solution, pp. 375–377  Trains rerouted to Kaunas  Originally the ghettos of Riga, Lodz, and Minsk were to receive the Reich Jews. In particular, it was planned to send 25 trains to Riga. There had been some reluctance on the part of the Reichskommissariat Ostland headquarters in Riga, headed by Hinrich Lohse, to having to find accommodation for 25,000 Jews.Browning, Origins of the Final Solution, pp. 332–333 This and other issues related to the treatment of Jews in the northern part of the Nazi-occupied Soviet territory, caused Lohse and his deputy Otto Drechsler to become embroiled in a dispute with Franz Walter Stahlecker, commander of the Einsatzgruppe A, who favored a more rapid policy of radical extermination.Browning, Origins of the Final Solution, pp. 285–286 On 8 November 1941, Stahlecker informed Lohse's staff in Riga that five of the 25 trains bound for Riga would go instead to the Kaunas Ghetto. Stahlecker did not state which of the 25 trains would be rerouted. On 20 November 1941, Rudolf Lange, another Einsatzgruppen commander, informed Lohse's administration that it would in fact be the first five trains that would be rerouted to Kaunas. By this time, some of the trains were already en route. They had left from Munich, Berlin, Frankfurt am Main, Vienna, and Breslau between 13 and 23 November.  Massacres  Karl Jäger was the head of Einsatzkommando 3, a sub-unit of Einsatzgruppe A. Under his command, Einsatzkommando 3 took everyone off the trains after their arrival to the Ninth Fort, where, shortly after arrival, the Einsatzkommando shot them all. There were two separate shootings, on 25 November and on 29 November. In the 25 November shooting, 1,159 men, 1,600 women, and 175 children were killed (resettlers from Berlin, Munich and Frankfurt). In the 29 November shooting, 693 men, 1,155 women, and 152 children were killed (resettlers from Vienna and Breslau). It is not known who issued the orders for the murders of these people.Rhodes, Masters of Death, p. 215  Significance  By November 1941, the Nazi regime had murdered very large numbers of people in mass shooting incidents, and the murder of 5,000 people, including large number of children, in two days would not have been unusual for the Einsatzgruppen. However, until the November massacres at the Ninth Fort, no Reich Jews had been killed in such massacres. Some Nazis who were quite willing to kill Ostjuden hesitated when it came to the Reich Jews. Wilhelm Kube, one of the chief Nazi officials in Minsk, stated: Consequently, it is believed issues of this nature related to the Ninth Fort murders, together with the 1,000 German Jews killed at Rumbula near Riga on 30 November, caused Himmler to temporarily (with certain exceptions) halt the mass killings of deported Reich Jews, until some means of slaughter other than mass shooting could be devised. Despite this, significant numbers of German Jews (approximately 4,300) were killed in Riga in February and March 1942, in massacres which included the Dünamünde Action. Important issues related to the Ninth Fort November killings remain in dispute among historians.Rosenman, The Wannsee Conference, pp. 75–76 In particular, it is unknown why Himmler should have (belatedly) objected to the murder of 1,000 Reich Jews at Riga on 30 November, when he apparently said nothing about the killings of 5,000 Reich Jews at the Ninth Fort on 25 and 29 November.

In colonial literature the name is often rendered in such ways as Litakun, also Litakoo or Lattakoo. The nineteenth century Tswana town At the time of the 1801 Truter-Somerville Expedition Dithakong was an important BaTlhaping (BaTswana) capital under Kgosi ('Chief') Molehebangwe. Significant accounts of this first expedition were left by, amongst others, William Somerville and John Barrow, with well-known watercolour illustrations by Samuel Daniell. Kgosi Mothibi, son of Molehebangwe, had succeeded as leader of the BaTlhaping by the time that William Burchell visited there in 1811. The early traveller accounts refer to an impressively large town consisting of mud houses, traces of which have yet to be located archaeologically.Morris, D. 1990. Dithakong. In Beaumont, P. & Morris,D. 1990. Guide to archaeological sites in the Northern Cape. Kimberley: McGregor Museum The Battle of Dithakong in 1823 was part of the conflict and upheavals ending a period of strife referred to in the interior as the Difaqane, and is subject to debate following Cobbing's critique of once orthodox views of the Mfecane as a period of conflict generated by Zulu expansion.Cobbing, J. 1988. The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo. Journal of African History, 29; Beck, R.B. Slavery in South Africa: Captive Labor on the Dutch Frontier The Battle of Dithakong The battle of Dithakong was fought between Manthatisi hordes and Batlhaping with the help of the Griqua. The epic battle that took almost seven hours was recorded by Robbet Moffatt on 23 June 1823 where the BaThlaping found themselves threatened by thousands of Batlokwa/Basotho of Mmanthatisi – the Phuting and the Hlakwana. The tribes fought each other for dwindling supplies of cattle and corn. They were armed, hungry and intent on raiding the BaThlaping’s cattle. This conflagration was rolling westwards – in the direction of Kuruman. Reverend Moffat rushed from Kuruman to Griquatown to persuade the Griqua to assist the BaThlaping. Reverend Waterboer in Griquatown, assisted by other Griqua leaders (Barend Barends from Danielskuil and Adam Kok II from Campbell) rode northwards with about 200 men. They were accompanied by BaTlhaping warriors. About 200 Griqua horsemen, armed with guns, faced the massed ranks of the Basotho armed with spears and cowhide shields. The BaTlhaping age regiments were held in reserve as the Griqua launched their attack. The Basotho suffered terrible casualties were forced to flee, a devastating and a first loss for Mmantahtisi after obliberating almost 29 tribes since leaving Harrismith at the start of Difaqane! Dithakong was later subjected to bombardment by colonial forces (under Charles Warren) suppressing a Tswana uprising in 1878. The earlier stone walled settlement On adjacent hills are stone walled ruins, also referred to as Dithakong (in fact the name means 'place of ruins'), about which Somerville enquired in 1801. The BaTlhaping claimed not to have known who had made or lived in this earlier town. Archaeological investigations have established Tswana affinities in this earlier settlement (itself showing more than one episode of development) which includes features indicative of frontier complexity at this south-western edge of Tswana expansion.Maggs, T. 2004. Litakun. In Morris, D. & Beaumont, P. (eds). Archaeology in the Northern Cape: some key sites. Kimberley: McGregor Museum. Modern Dithakong Dithakong today is a local centre in the Joe Morolong (formerly Moshaweng) Municipality of the John Taola Gaetsewe District Municipality. Dithakong is the birthplace of Matthews Batswadi, the first black South African athlete to be awarded national sporting colours, known as Springbok Colours, after the institutionalisation of Apartheid by the Nationalist Party government following its election victory in 1948. Batswadi was born in the village in 1949 and has lived there ever since retiring from work at the Beatrix Gold Mine in the Free State and from active competition in 1986. He was awarded Springbok Colours in 1977 after racial discrimination was removed from the constitution of the then controlling body, the South African Amateur Athletics Union, thereby allowing blacks to receive national sporting colours.Richard Mayer, Three Men Named Matthews - Memories of the Golden Age of South African Distance Running and its Aftermath.

It can be described as a humanistic psychodynamic psychotherapy, which is based on a positive conception of human nature. PPT is an integrative method which includes humanistic, systemic, psychodynamic and CBT-elements. Today there are centers and trainings in some twenty countries worldwide. It should not be confused with positive psychology.Theo A. Cope, Positive Psychotherapy: 'Let the Truth be Told'. International Journal of Psychotherapy, Vol 18, No 2, July 2014, http://www. ijp.org.uk Beginnings The founder of positive psychotherapy, Nossrat Peseschkian (1933–2010), was an Iranian-born German certified psychiatrist, neurologist and psychotherapist. He was inspired in the late 1960s and early 1970s by different sources, persons and developments: * The spirit of that time, which brought into existence humanistic psychology and its further developments. * Personal encounters with prominent psychotherapists and psychiatrists, such as Viktor Frankl, Jacob L. Moreno, Heinrich Mengsee :de:Heinrich Meng and others. * By the humanistic teachings and virtues of the Bahá'í Faith. * By looking for an integrative method, especially because of problems between psychoanalysts and behaviour therapists at that time * Based on transcultural observations in over 20 cultures, and searching for an integrative method which is cultur- sensitive The term \\"positive\\" The method was called \\"differentiational analysis\\" until 1977. In 1977, Nossrat Peseschkian published his work \\"Positive Psychotherapie\\",Positive Psychotherapie. Theorie und Praxis einer neuen Methode. Fischer Verlag, Frankfurt am Main, 1977 which was published in English as \\"Positive Psychotherapy\\"Positive Psychotherapy. Theory and Practice of a New Method. Springer Berlin Heidelberg New York, 1987 in 1987. The term \\"positive\\" is derived from the original Latin expression \\"positum or positivus\\" which means the actual, the real, the concrete. The aim of positive psychotherapy and positive psychotherapists is to help the patient and client to see also their abilities, strengths, resources and potentials. Main characteristics * Integrative psychotherapy method * Humanistic Psychodynamic Method * Cohesive, integrated therapeutic system * Conflict- centered short-term method * Cultur-sensitive method * Use of stories, anecdotes and wisdoms * Innovative interventions and techniques * Application in psychotherapy, other medical disciplines, counselling, education, prevention, management and trainings Main principles The three main principles or pillars of positive psychotherapy are: * The Principle of Hope * The Principle of Balance * The Principle of Consultation 1\\\\. The Principle of Hope implies that the therapist wants to assist patients to understand and see the meaning and purpose of their disorder or conflict. Accordingly, the disorder will be reinterpreted in a \\"positive\\" way (positive interpretations): Some examples: * Sleep disturbance is the ability to be watchful and get by with little sleep * Depression is the ability to react with deepest emotionality to conflicts * Schizophrenia is the ability to live in two worlds at the same time or to live in a fantasy world * Anorexia nervosa is the ability to get along with few meals and identify with the hunger of the world Through this positive view, a change of standpoint becomes possible, not only for the patient, but also for his environment. Hence, illnesses have a symbolic function which has to be recognized by both therapist and patient. The patient learns that the symptoms and complaints of the illness are signals to bring his or her four qualities of life into new balance. 2\\\\. Principle of Balance: Despite social and cultural differences and the uniqueness of every human being, it can be observed that during the management of their problems that all humans refer to typical forms of coping. Thomas Kornbichler explains: \\"Nossrat Peseschkian formulated with the Balance Model of Positive Psychotherapy (an innovative contemporary approach to dynamic psychotherapy) a vivid model of coping with conflicts in different cultures.\\" According to the balance model, the four areas of life are: 1. body/health – psychosomatic; 2. achievement/work – stress factors; 3. contact/relationships – depression; 4. future/purpose/meaning of life – fears and phobia. Though these four ranges are inherent in all humans, in the western hemisphere the emphasis is more often on the areas of body/senses and profession/achievement in contrast to the eastern hemisphere where the areas are contact, fantasy and future (cross- cultural aspect of positive psychotherapy). Lack of contact and imagination are some of the causes of many psychosomatic diseases. Everyone develops his or her own preferences on how to cope with conflicts that occur. Through a one-sided mode to the conflict solution, the other modes become eclipsed. The conflict contents (e.g. punctuality, orderliness, politeness, trust, time, patience) are described in terms of primary and secondary capacities, based on the basic capacities of loving and knowing. This can be seen as a content-wise differentiation of Freud's classical model of the instances. 3\\\\. Principle of Consultation: Five-stages of therapy and self-help. The five stages of positive psychotherapy represent a concept in which therapy and self-help are closely interrelated. The patient and the family are informed together about the illness and the individual solution to it. * 1st Step: Observation; distancing (perception: the capacity to express desire and problems) * 2nd Step: Taking inventory (cognitive capacities: events in the last 5 to 10 years) * 3rd Step: Situational encouragement (self-help and resource- activation of the patient: the ability to use past successes in conflict solution) * 4th Step: Verbalization (communicative capacities: the ability to express outstanding conflicts and problems in the four qualities of life) * 5th Step: Expansion of goals (in order to evoke forward–looking orientation in life after the problems are solved, the patient is asked: \\"What would you like to do, when no more problems are left to be solved? What are your goals for the next five years?\\") Development and international network The main emphasis of positive psychotherapy during the past 40 years has been treatment, training and publication. * In 1979, the Wiesbaden Postgraduate Training Institute for Psychotherapy and Family Therapy was established as a postgraduate training for physicians in Wiesbaden, Germany. In 1999, the Wiesbaden Academy for Psychotherapy (WIAP), a state-licensed, postgraduate psychotherapy academy with a large outpatient clinic, was established for the training of psychologists and educational scientists. * Most Positive Psychotherapists work in private offices or in clinics. In Germany, Positive Psychotherapy is counted as a psychodynamic method and the health insurance covers the costs. * Since the early 1980s, seminars and trainings have taken place in some 60 countries. Today, Positive Psychotherapy is practiced in more than 25 countries with approximately 30 independent centres and institutions. The training programs for mental health professionals consist of basic and master trainings over several years. * The international head office is based in Wiesbaden, Germany. Positive psychotherapy is represented internationally by the World Association of Positive and Transcultural Psychotherapy (WAPP). Its international governing board of directors is elected every two years. There are national and regional associations in some ten countries. * PPT and its therapists have been engaged in the international development of psychotherapy, and are active members of international and continental associations European Association of psychotherapy.

But even before the arrival of the Europeans, the Inca Empire was floundering. Pizarro enjoyed stunning successes in his military campaign against the Incas, who, despite some resistance, were defeated and in 1538 the Spaniards completely defeated Inca forces near Lake Titicaca, allowing Spanish penetration into central and southern Bolivia. Although native resistance continued for some years, Spanish conquerors pushed forward, founding cities of La Paz in 1549 and Santa Cruz de la Sierra in 1561. In the region then known as Upper Peru, the Spaniards found the mineral treasure chest they had been searching for - Potosí had the Western world's largest concentration of silver. At its height in the 16th century, Potosí supported a population of more than 150,000, making it the world's largest urban center. In the 1570s, Viceroy Francisco de Toledo introduced a coercive form of labor, the mita, which required native males from highland districts to spend every sixth year working in the mines. The mita, along with technological advances in refining, caused mining at Potosí to flourish. In the early 18th century, the mining industry entered a prolonged period of decline, as evidenced by the eclipsing of Potosí by La Paz. After 1700, only small amounts of bullion were shipped from Upper Peru to Spain. In the mid-18th century, Spanish control over South America began to weaken. In 1780 the Inca descendant, Túpac Amaru II led nearly 60,000 natives in a battle against the Spaniards near the Peruvian city of Cuzco. Spain put down the revolt in 1783 and executed thousands of natives as punishment, but the revolt illustrated the precarious nature of Spanish colonial rule in the Andes. Conquest and colonial rule, 1532-1809 upright Conquest and settlement Francisco Pizarro, Diego de Almagro, and Hernando de Luque led the Spanish discovery and conquest of the Inca Empire. They first sailed south in 1524 along the Pacific coast from Panama to confirm the legendary existence of a land of gold called Biru.Maria Luise Wagner. \\"Conquest and settlement\\". In Hudson & Hanratty. left Because the rapidly expanding Inca Empire was internally weak, the conquest was remarkably easy. After the Inca Huayna Capac died in 1527, his sons Huascar and Atahualpa fought a civil war over the succession. Although Atahualpa defeated his brother, he had not yet consolidated his power when the Spaniards arrived in 1532, and he seriously misjudged their strength. Atahualpa did not attempt to defeat Pizarro when he arrived on the coast in 1532 because the Incan ruler was convinced that those who commanded the mountains also controlled the coast. When Pizarro formed alliances with Indians who resented Inca rule, Atahualpa did not modify the Inca ceremonial approach to warfare, which included launching attacks by the light of the full moon. On November 16, 1532, Pizarro took Atahualpa prisoner during their first encounter and later executed him, even after payment of a ransom equivalent to half a century of European production of gold and silver. One year later, Cuzco fell. Tupac Amaru Despite Pizarro's quick victory, Indian rebellions soon began and continued periodically throughout the colonial period. In 1537 Manco Inca, whom the Spanish had established as a puppet emperor, rebelled against the new rulers and restored a \\"neo-Inca\\" state. This state continued to challenge Spanish authority even after the Spanish suppressed the revolt and beheaded Túpac Amaru in the public square of Cuzco in 1572. Later revolts in the Bolivian highlands were usually organized by the elders of the community and remained local in nature, the exception being the great rebellion of Túpac Amaru II in the eighteenth century. During the first two decades of Spanish rule, the settlement of the Bolivian highlands — now known as Upper (Alto) Peru or Charcas — was delayed by a civil war between the forces of Pizarro and those of Almagro. The two conquistadors had divided the Incan territory, with the north under the control of Pizarro and the south under that of Almagro. Fighting broke out in 1537 when Almagro seized Cuzco after suppressing the Manco Inca rebellion. Pizarro defeated and executed Almagro in 1538, following the Battle of Las Salinas, but was himself assassinated three years later by former supporters of Almagro. Pizarro's brother Gonzalo assumed control of Upper Peru but soon became embroiled in a rebellion against the Spanish crown. Only with the execution of Gonzalo Pizarro in 1548 did Spain succeed in reasserting its authority; later that year, colonial authorities established the city of La Paz, which soon became an important commercial and transshipment center. Indian resistance delayed the conquest and settlement of the Bolivian lowlands. The Spanish established Santa Cruz de la Sierra in 1561, but the Gran Chaco, the colonial name for the arid Chaco region, remained a violent frontier throughout the colonial period. In the Chaco, the Indians, mostly Chiriguano, carried out unrelenting attacks against colonial settlements and remained independent of direct Spanish control. The economy of colonial Upper Peru Spain immediately recognized the enormous economic potential of Upper Peru. The highlands were rich in minerals, and Potosí had the Western world's largest concentration of silver. The area was heavily populated and could supply workers for the silver mines. In addition, Upper Peru could provide food for the miners on the Altiplano.Maria Luise Wagner. \\"The economy of Upper Peru\\". In Hudson & Hanratty. Silver mining Francisco de Toledo Despite these conditions, silver production fluctuated dramatically during the colonial period. After an initial fifteen-year surge in production, output began to fall in 1560 as a result of a severe labor shortage caused by the Indian population's inability to resist European diseases. Around the same time, Potosí's rich surface deposits became depleted, which meant that even more labor would be required to extract silver. The labor shortage was addressed by Francisco de Toledo, the energetic viceroy (the king's personal representative) of Peru, during a visit to Upper Peru in the 1570s. Toledo used the pre-Columbian mita to extract forced labor for the mines at Potosí from some sixteen districts in the highlands, which were designated as supplying mita. Adult males could be required to spend every sixth year working in the mines. Henceforth, Potosí mining depended on the mita as well as on a labor system in which relatively free men worked alongside those who were coerced. Toledo also regulated the mining laws, established a mint at Potosí, and introduced the mercury amalgam process. Adoption of the amalgam process was particularly important in that it eliminated Indian control over refining. The second problem, the exhaustion of the high-content surface ores, required technological innovations. Hydraulic power took on increased importance because of the construction of large refining centers. By 1621 a system of artificial lakes with a storage capacity of several million tons provided a steady supply of water for refineries. With the labor and technological problems resolved, silver mining flourished. By the middle of the 17th century, silver mining at Potosí had become so important that the city had the largest population in the Western Hemisphere, approximately 160,000 inhabitants. The end of the 17th boom was followed by a major decline in the mining industry. The exhaustion of the first rich veins required deeper and more expensive shafts. The rapid decrease of the Indian population as a result of disease and exploitation by the mita also contributed to the reduction in silver output. After 1700 only small amounts of bullion from Upper Peru were shipped to Spain. Kings from the Bourbon Dynasty in Spain tried to reform the colonial economy in the mid-eighteenth century by reviving mining. The Spanish crown provided the financial support necessary to develop deeper shafts, and in 1736 it agreed to lower the tax rate from 20 to 10 percent of the total output. The crown also helped create a minerals purchasing bank, the Banco de San Carlos in 1751 and subsidized the price of mercury to local mines. The foundation of an academy of metallurgy in Potosí indicated the crown's concern with technical improvements in silver production. The attempts to revive the mining sector in Upper Peru were only partially successful, however, and could not halt the economic collapse of Potosí at the beginning of the 19th century. Nevertheless, mining remained critical to the economy of Upper Peru because food supplies sent from the valleys to mining centers on the Altiplano influenced agricultural production. Agriculture Farming at first took place on colonial encomiendas. The crown granted a small number of conquistadors the right to the labor and produce of Indians living on the encomienda, and by the 1650s there were some eighty-two encomiendas in Upper Peru. Encomenderos tended to monopolize agricultural production, control the cheap Indian labor, and collect the tribute that the Indians had to pay to the crown. Because encomenderos were difficult to control and abused their laborers, the crown tried repeatedly to bring Indians under its direct jurisdiction and control. In the second half of the sixteenth century, agricultural production shifted from encomiendas to large estates, on which Indians worked in exchange for the use of land. Cochabamba became a major producer of corn and wheat, and the valleys produced coca leaves in increasing amounts during colonial rule. In addition to mining and agricultural production, Indian tribute (alcabala) became an increasingly important source of income for the crown despite Indian migration to avoid payment. An early effort to collect tribute from Indians by moving them into villages or indigenous communities (comunidades indígenas) was unsuccessful because of resistance from both encomenderos and Indians. But by the late 18th century, an increase in the Indian population, the extension of tribute payments to all Indian males (including those who owned land), and a relative decline in income from the mines combined to make alcabala the second largest source of income in Upper Peru. Tribute payments also increased because Spanish absolutism made no concessions to human misfortune, such as natural disasters. The Indian tribute was increased by 1 million Spanish dollars annually. Colonial state, church, and society Administration The longevity of Spain's empire in South America can be explained partly by the successful administration of the colonies. At first it was primarily interested in controlling the independent-minded conquistadors, but the main goal soon became maintaining the flow of revenue to the crown and collecting the tribute of goods and labor from the Indian population. To this end, Spain soon created an elaborate bureaucracy in the New World in which various institutions served as watchdogs over each other and local officials had considerable autonomy.Maria Luise Wagner. \\"State, church, and society\\". In Hudson & Hanratty. Upper Peru, at first a part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, was included in the new Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata (whose capital was Buenos Aires) when it was created in 1776. The viceroy was aided by the audiencia (council), which was simultaneously the highest court of appeal in the jurisdiction and, in the absence of the viceroy, also had administrative and executive powers. The wealth of Upper Peru and its remoteness from Lima convinced the authorities in Lima to create an audiencia in the city of Chuquisaca (present-day Sucre) in 1558. Chuquisaca had become particularly important as Potosí's administrative and agricultural supply center. The jurisdiction of the audiencia, known as Audiencia of Charcas, initially covered a radius of 100 \\"leagues\\" (179,600 hectares) around Chuquisaca, but it soon included Santa Cruz and territory belonging to present-day Paraguay and, until 1568, also the entire district of Cuzco. The president of the audiencia had judicial authority as well as administrative and executive powers in the region, but only in routine matters; more important decisions were made in Lima. This situation led to a competitive attitude and the reputation of Upper Peru for assertiveness, a condition reinforced by the economic importance of the region. Spain exercised its control of smaller administrative units in the colonies through royal officials, such as the corregidor, who represented the king in the municipal governments that were elected by their citizens. By the early 17th century there were four corregidores in Upper Peru. In the late 18th century Spain undertook an administrative reform to increase revenues of the crown and to eliminate a number of abuses. It created an intendancy system, giving extensive powers to highly qualified officials who were directly responsible to the king. In 1784 Spain established four intendancy districts in Upper Peru, covering the present-day departments of La Paz, Cochabamba, Potosí, and Chuquisaca. The Spanish crown at first controlled the local governments indirectly, but centralized procedures as the time went on. At first, Viceroy Francisco de Toledo confirmed the rights of local nobles and guaranteed them local autonomy. But the crown eventually came to employ Spanish officials, corregidores de indios, to collect tribute and taxes from the Indians. Corregidores de indios also imported goods and forced the Indians to buy them, a widely abused practice that proved to be an enormous source of wealth for these officials but caused much resentment among the Indian population. Religion The thumb With the first Spanish settlers of Upper Peru came the secular and regular clergy to begin the conversion of the Indians to Christianity. In 1552 the first bishopric in Upper Peru was established in La Plata; in 1605 La Paz and Santa Cruz also became bishoprics. In 1623 the Jesuits established the Royal and Pontifical Higher University of San Francisco Xavier of Chuquisaca, Upper Peru's first university. Although the official Incan religion disappeared rapidly, the Indians continued their local worship under the protection of local Indian rulers. But as Christianity influenced the Indians, a new folk-Catholicism developed, incorporating symbols of the indigenous religion. The church was tolerant of local Indian religions. In 1582, for example, the bishop of La Plata permitted the Indians to build a sanctuary for the dark Virgen de Copacabana on the shores of Lake Titicaca (Copacabana has been a traditional Aymara religious center ever since). Situation of the Native peoples The conquest and colonial rule were traumatic experiences for the Indians. Easily susceptible to European diseases, the native population decreased rapidly. The situation of the Indians worsened in the 18th century, when Spain demanded higher tribute payments and increased mita obligations in an attempt to increase the mining output. These profound economic and social changes, and the breakup of native culture contributed to the increasing addiction to alcohol. Before the Spanish arrived, the Incas had consumed alcohol only during religious ceremonies. Indian use of the coca leaf also increased, and, according to one chronicler, at the end of the 16th century \\"in Potosí alone, the trade in coca amounts to over half a million pesos a year, for 95,000 baskets of it are consumed.\\" Indian reaction to colonial rule and conversion to Christianity varied. Many Indians adapted to Spanish ways by breaking with their traditions and actively attempting to enter the market economy. They also used the courts to protect their interests, especially against new tribute assessments. Others clung to their customs as much as possible, and some rebelled against the white rulers. Native rebellions Local, mostly uncoordinated, rebellions occurred throughout colonial rule. More than 100 revolts occurred in the 18th century alone in Bolivia and Peru. Whereas early Indian rebellions were anti- Christian, the revolts at the end of the sixteenth century were based in messianic Christian symbolism that was Roman Catholic and anti-Spanish. Increasing Indian discontent with colonial rule sparked the great rebellion of Túpac Amaru II. Born José Gabriel Condorcanqui, this educated, Spanish- speaking Indian took the name of his ancestor, Túpac Amaru. During the 1770s, he became embittered over the harsh treatment of the Indians by the corregidores de indios. In November 1780 Túpac Amaru II and his followers seized and executed a particularly cruel corregidor de indios. Although Túpac Amaru II insisted that his movement was reformist and did not seek to overthrow Spanish rule, his demands included an autonomous region for natives. The uprising quickly became a full-scale revolt. Approximately 60,000 Indians in the Peruvian and Bolivian Andes rallied to the cause. After scoring some initial victories, including defeating a Spanish army of 1,200 men, Túpac Amaru II was captured and killed in May 1781; nonetheless, the revolt continued, primarily in Upper Peru. There, a supporter of Túpac Amaru II, the Indian chief Tomás Catari, had led an uprising in Potosí during the early months of 1780. Catari was killed by the Spaniards a month before Túpac Amaru II. Another major revolt was led by Julián Apaza, a sexton who took the names of the two rebel martyrs by calling himself Túpac Catari (also spelled Katari). He besieged La Paz for more than 100 days. Spain did not succeed in putting down all of the revolts until 1783 and then proceeded to execute thousands of Indians. Growing Criollo dissent In the late 18th century, a growing discontent with the Spanish rule developed among the criollos (persons of pure Spanish descent born in the New World). Criollos began to assume active roles in the economy, especially in mining and agricultural production, and thus resented the trade barriers established by the mercantilist policies of the Spanish crown. In addition, criollos were incensed that Spain reserved all upper-level administrative positions for peninsulares (Spanish-born persons residing in the New World). The Enlightenment, with its emphasis on reason, questioning of authority and tradition, and individualistic tendencies, also contributed to criollo discontent. The Inquisition had not kept the writings of Niccolò Machiavelli, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Paine, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, John Locke, and others out of Spanish America; their ideas were often discussed by criollos, especially those educated at the university in Chuquisaca. At first the criollos of Upper Peru were influenced by the French Revolution, but they eventually rejected it as too violent. Although Upper Peru was fundamentally loyal to Spain, the ideas of the Enlightenment and independence from Spain continued to be discussed by scattered groups of radicals.

A number of radical criollos in 1808-10 began a local power struggle. Pedro Domingo Murillo proclaimed an independent state in Upper Peru in the name of king Ferdinand VII. During the following seven years Upper Peru became the battleground between the armed forces of independent United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata and royalist troops from Viceroyalty of Peru. After 1820 the criollos who had formed the Conservative Party supported General Pedro Antonio de Olañeta. During the 1820–1823 liberal revolution in Spain, Olañeta, convinced that revolution threatens the traditional royal authority, refused to join the royalist forces or the rebel armies under the command of Simón Bolívar and Antonio José de Sucre y Alcalá. Olañeta did not relinquish his command even after the Peruvian royalists included him and his forces in the capitulation agreement following their defeat in the Battle of Ayacucho in 1824, the final battle of the wars of independence in Latin America. Olañeta continued his resistance until he was killed by his own men on April 2, 1825. During the 1829-39 presidency of Marshal Andrés de Santa Cruz, Bolivia enjoyed the most successful period of its early history with great social and economic reforms. Santa Cruz got involved in Peruvian politics and succeeded in unifying Peru and Bolivia into the Peru–Bolivian Confederation. During the War of the Confederation, Chilean and Peruvian rebel armies were forced sign the peace treaty known as the Paucarpata Treaty, which included their unconditional surrender, but in 1839 Battle of Yungay the army of Confederation was defeated. This was the turning point in Bolivian history; for the next 40 years coups and short-lived regimes dominated Bolivian politics. Plagued by a vicious economic and political crisis, Bolivia's weakness was further demonstrated during the War of the Pacific (1879–1883), when it lost access to the ocean and the nitrate rich fields to Chile. Increase in the world price of silver brought Bolivia a measure of relative prosperity and political stability in the late 1800s under the Conservative Party. In about 1907 tin replaced silver as the country's most important source of wealth. A succession of Liberal Party governments applied laissez-faire policies throughout the first two decades of the 20th century before the coup of the Republican Party in 1920. Struggle for independence Pedro Domingo Murillo led an 1809 revolt in La Paz, claiming an independent state in Upper Peru. The invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in 1807–1808 by Napoleon Bonaparte's forces proved critical for the independence struggle in South America. The overthrow of the Bourbon Dynasty and the placement of Joseph Bonaparte on the Spanish throne tested the loyalty of the local elites in Upper Peru, who were suddenly confronted with several conflicting authorities. Most remained loyal to Bourbons. Taking a wait-and- see attitude, they supported the Junta Central (Central Junta) in Spain, a government in the name of the abdicated king Ferdinand VII of Spain. While some liberals eagerly welcomed the reforms of colonial rule promised by Joseph Bonaparte, others supported the claims of Carlota, Ferdinand's sister, who governed Brazil with her husband, Prince Regent John of Portugal, and a number of radical criollos (persons of pure Spanish descent born in the New World) wanted independence for Upper Peru.Maria Luise Wagner. \\"Struggle for independence\\". In Hudson & Hanratty. This conflict of authority resulted in a local power struggle in Upper Peru between 1808 and 1810 and constituted the first phase of the efforts to achieve independence. In 1808 the president of the audiencia, Ramón García León de Pizarro, demanded affiliation with the Junta Central. The conservative judges of the audiencia were influenced, however, by their autocratic royalist philosophy and refused to recognize the authority of the junta because they saw it as a product of a rebellion. On May 25, 1809, tensions grew when the radical criollos, refusing to recognize the junta because they wanted independence, took to the streets. This revolt, one of the first in Latin America, was soon put down by the authorities. On July 16, 1809, Pedro Domingo Murillo led another revolt by criollos and mestizos (those of mixed European and Indian ancestry) in La Paz and proclaimed an independent state in Upper Peru in the name of Ferdinand VII. The loyalty to Ferdinand was a pretense used to legitimize the independence movement. By November 1809, Cochabamba, Oruro, and Potosí had joined Murillo. Although the revolt was put down by royalist forces sent to La Paz by the viceroy of Peru and to Chuquisaca by the viceroy of Río de La Plata, Upper Peru was never again completely controlled by Spain. The Battle of Ayacucho was the final battle of the wars of independence in Latin America. During the following seven years, Upper Peru became the battleground for forces of the independent United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata and royalist troops from Viceroyalty of Peru. Although the royalists repulsed four Argentine invasions, guerrillas controlled most of the countryside, where they formed six major republiquetas, or zones of insurrection. In these zones, local patriotism would eventually develop into the fight for independence. By 1817 Upper Peru was relatively quiet and under the control of Lima. After 1820 the Conservative Party criollos supported General Pedro Antonio de Olañeta, a Charcas native, who refused to accept the measures by the Spanish Cortes (legislature) to conciliate the colonies after the liberal revolution in Spain. Olañeta, convinced that these measures threatened royal authority, refused to join the royalist forces or the rebel armies under the command of Simón Bolívar and Antonio José de Sucre y Alcalá. Olañeta did not relinquish his command even after the Peruvian royalists included him and his forces in the capitulation agreement following their defeat in the Battle of Ayacucho in 1824, the final battle of the wars of independence in Latin America. Olañeta continued a quixotic war until Sucre's forces defeated his forces, and he was killed by his own men on April 1, 1825, in a battle that effectively ended Spanish rule in Upper Peru. Creating Bolivia: Bolívar, Sucre, and Santa Cruz Andrés de Santa Cruz y Calahumana was Bolivia's first locally-born president. Bolivian Declaration of Independence On August 6, 1825, the assembly adopted a Bolivian Declaration of Independence. Five days later, the assembly, hoping to placate Bolívar's reservations about the independence of Upper Peru, resolved to name the new nation after him.Maria Luise Wagner. \\"Construction of Bolivia: Bolívar, Sucre, and Santa Cruz\\". In Hudson & Hanratty. Simon Bolívar entered La Paz triumphantly on August 8, 1825. During his brief rule of less than five months, he issued a flood of decrees, resolutions, and orders reflecting his ideas about government. He declared the equality of all citizens and abolished the tribute payments, replacing them with a \\"direct contribution\\" (contribución directa) that amounted to less than half of the previous payments. Bolívar also decreed a land reform to distribute land, preferably to Indians, and tried to reduce the influence of the Roman Catholic Church in politics. Most of his decrees could not be implemented during his short tenure, but they were included in the constitution he wrote for Bolivia after his departure in January 1826. Despite his efforts at reform, Bolívar was outspoken about his doubts about the ability of Bolivians to govern themselves. He was careful to avoid recognizing Bolivia's independence, always referring to the country as Upper Peru and signing his decrees as dictator of Peru. Only in January 1826, when he turned the country over to Sucre, did he promise that the Peruvian legislature would approve Bolivia's independence. Bolívar transferred his authority over Upper Peru to his lieutenant Antonio José de Sucre who was formally installed as Bolivia's first elected president after the General Constituent Assembly convened in May and elected him. Sucre convened the Constituent assembly in Chuquisaca to determine the future of the region. Almost all delegates wanted an independent Upper Peru and rejected attachment to Argentina or Peru. The new Republic, created in the territory of the Audencia of Charcas, faced profound problems. The wars of independence had disrupted the economy. The entire mining industry was in decline because of destruction, flooding, and abandonment of mines. Lack of investment and scarcity of labor contributed to a sharp drop in silver production. Agricultural production was low, and Bolivia had to import food, even the basic staples consumed by the Indian population. The government had serious financial difficulties because of the huge military expenditures and debt payments to Peru as compensation for the army of liberation. All these problems were aggravated by the isolation of the new republic from the outside world and the difficulties of securing its borders. During Sucre's three-year rule, the government tried to solve its grave financial problems, which were aggravated by the lack of foreign credit. Sucre reformed the existing tax structure in an effort to finance public expenditures and tried to revive silver mining by attracting foreign capital and technology. In one of the most radical attacks on the church anywhere in Latin America, he confiscated church wealth in Bolivia and closed down many monasteries. The Roman Catholic Church in Bolivia never recovered the powerful role that it had held. Import duties and taxes on the internal movement of goods were also important sources of state revenue. In addition, Sucre reestablished tribute payments in an attempt to solve the country's financial crisis. Sucre's attempts at reform were only partially successful because Bolivia lacked the administration to carry them out. Many Conservative Party criollos turned away when his reforms threatened to challenge the economic and social patterns of the colonial past. As opposition increased, the local nationalist elite came to resent the leadership of their Venezuelan-born president. The invasion of Bolivia by the Peruvian general Agustín Gamarra and an assassination attempt in April 1827 led to Sucre's resignation in 1828. Sucre left the country for voluntary exile, convinced that \\"the solution was impossible\\". Despite the fall of his government, Sucre's policies formed the basis for the following ten-year rule of Andrés de Santa Cruz y Calahumana (1829–39), the first native-born president, who was sworn into office in May 1829 after a series of short-term rulers. Santa Cruz, a mestizo, had a brilliant military career fighting for independence in the armies of Bolívar. His close connection with Bolívar had led to a short interlude as the president of Peru in 1826. It also made him a strong candidate to become Bolivia's new president after Sucre's resignation. Santa Cruz created a relatively stable economic, social, and political order in Bolivia. In an attempt to overcome Bolivia's isolation Santa Cruz opened the port of Cobija on the Pacific coast. He also devalued the silver currency to finance government activities, instituted protective tariffs in support of the local cotton cloth (tucuyo) industry, and reduced the mining tax, thereby increasing mining output. In addition, Santa Cruz codified the country's laws and enacted Latin America's first civil and commercial codes. The Higher University of San Andrés in La Paz was also founded during his rule. Although Santa Cruz approved a democratic constitution, he ruled virtually as a dictator and did not tolerate opposition. Location of the Peru-Bolivia Confederation Santa Cruz continued his political ambitions in Peru while president of Bolivia. He established the Peru–Bolivian Confederation in 1836, justifying his act with the threat of Chile's expansion to the north. This threat, together with the constant turmoil in Peru and repeated attempts by Agustín Gamarra to invade Bolivia, had made Sucre's military intervention in a Peruvian civil war in 1835 a matter of life and death for Bolivia. After winning a number of battles in Peru, Santa Cruz reorganized that country into two autonomous states—the Republic of North Peru and the Republic of South Peru—and joined them with Bolivia in the Peru-Bolivia Confederation with himself as Supreme protector. The potential power of this confederation aroused the opposition of Argentina and, above all, Chile; both nations declared war on the confederation. In the initial round of hostilities, Santa Cruz managed to repel an attack by Argentina, and surrounded Chilean forces at Paucarpata where he forced the Vice Admiral Manuel Blanco Encalada to sign a peace treaty. However, the Chilean government rejected the treaty and launched a second offensive against the Confederation. Santa Cruz' decisive defeat by Chilean forces in the Battle of Yungay in January 1839, coupled with revolts in both Bolivia and Peru, resulted in the breakup of the confederation and ended the career of Bolivia's ablest nineteenth-century president. Santa Cruz went into exile in Ecuador. Political instability and economic decline, 1839–1879 José Ballivián restored relative calm to Bolivia between 1842 and 1847. For the next 40 years Bolivia was characterized by a chaotic political situation and a declining economy. The country relied on taxes paid by the Indians as its main source of income. Although some of the government's leaders during this period tried to reform the country, most fit the description of caudillos bárbaros (barbaric caudillos), a term used by Bolivian writer Alcides Arguedas for inept and corrupt rulers.Maria Luise Wagner. \\"Political instability and economic decline (1839-79)\\". In Hudson & Hanratty. Santa Cruz was succeeded in June 1839 by General José Miguel de Velasco Franco (1828, 1829, 1839–41 and 1848), who tried to control the political intrigues and maneuvering between the supporters and opponents of Santa Cruz. After failing to repel yet another invasion by Gamarra, Velasco was overthrown. Gamarra was killed in November 1841 near La Paz in the Battle of Ingavi, after the victory, Bolivia invaded Perú, several fronts of struggle were opened in the Peruvian south. The eviction of the Bolivian troops in the south of Peru would be achieved by the greater availability of material and human resources of Peru, the Bolivian Army did not have enough troops to maintain the occupation. In the district of Locumba - Tacna, a column between Peruvian soldiers and peasants defeated a Bolivian regiment in the so-called Battle of Los Altos de Chipe (Locumba). In the district of Sama and in Arica, the Peruvian colonel José María Lavayén organizes a troop that manages to defeat the Bolivian forces of Colonel Rodríguez Magariños which dislodges the port of Arica. The battle of Tarapacá of 1842, Peruvian militias formed by the commander Juan Buendía, defeated on January 7, 1842, the detachment led by Colonel bolivian José María García, who died in the confrontation. Thus, the Bolivian troops leave Tacna, Arica and Tarapacá in February of 1842, retreating towards Moquegua and Puno. The combats of Motoni and Orurillo expelled and subsequently initiated the withdrawal of Bolivian forces occupying Peruvian territory, threatening again Bolivia to suffer an invasion. At the end of the war, the Treaty of Puno was signed on June 7, 1842. However, the climate of tension between Lima and La Paz would continue until 1847, when the signing of a Peace and Trade Treaty became effective. José Ballivián (1841–1847) is remembered for restoring relative calm to the nation between 1842 and 1847. Reversing Santa Cruz's protectionist policies, Ballivián encouraged free trade. He also promoted the colonization of the Beni savanna. Nonetheless, the main income continued to come from the taxes paid by rural Indians. These included not only a head tax but also a tax on coca leaves, which were consumed almost exclusively by the Indian population. Although nearly 90 percent of all Bolivians lived in rural areas according to the 1846 census, agriculture generated little revenue. Most haciendas stagnated, and only the collection of chinchona bark (for the production of quinine) and coca leaves increased in the valleys. After the overthrow of Ballivián in 1847, Manuel Isidoro Belzu (1848–55) emerged as the most powerful figure in Bolivia. Unlike his predecessors, Belzu sought the support of the masses. In order to gain the backing of the Indians, he started a campaign against the aristocratic landowners, seized their land, and incited the Indians to destroy the homes of the landowners. He also hoped to get the support of the artisans who had been hurt by the free-trade policies of Ballivián by restricting the role of foreign merchants in Bolivia and limiting imports. Belzu's effort succeeded in one sense because he fended off forty-two coup attempts during his rule. \\"Tata\\" Belzu, as he was called by the Indians (like the head of the ayllu in pre-Columbian times), has been seen as the precursor of Andean populism. Attempting to stir the masses in demagogic speeches, Belzu completely alienated the Bolivian establishment with his reign of terror. As efforts to overthrow him increased, he resigned in 1855 and left for Europe. José María Linares (1857–1861), a member of the elite that had opposed Belzu, overthrew Belzu's son-in-law, General Jorge Córdova (1855–57), and became the first civilian president. Linares reversed Belzu's protective policies and encouraged free trade and foreign investment, mainly from Britain and Chile. During his presidency, mining output increased because of technological innovations, such as the steam engine, and the discovery of huge nitrate deposits in the Atacama Desert (in present-day Chile). The presidency of José María Achá was one of the most violent periods in Bolivia's history. Although the mining sector improved, it failed to stimulate agricultural production, and most haciendas continued in a relative state of stagnation. This malaise contributed to the survival of campesino communities during the 19th century, despite repeated assaults on their common landholdings by various governments. The tax burden on the Indians resulted in campesino revolts in Copacabana. The overthrow of Linares by a military coup in 1861 initiated one of the most violent periods in Bolivian history under the rule of General José María Achá (1861–64). Achá is remembered for the 1861 \\"murders of Yáñez\\", the massacre of seventy-one Belzú supporters (Belcistas) including General Córdova by Colonel Plácido Yáñez, the military commander in La Paz. In late 1864 General Mariano Melgarejo (1864–1871) seized the presidency and became the most notorious of Bolivia's caudillos. Relying primarily on the military, he remained in power for more than six years despite his mismanagement, drunkenness, and corruption, as well as constant intrigues against him. Hoping to improve the economy by opening up the country to foreigners, Melgarejo signed a series of free trade treaties with Chile and Peru. In an 1867 treaty with Empire of Brazil to secure water rights to the Atlantic Ocean, he ceded 102,400 square kilometers of territory, hoping to break Bolivia's isolation. Melgarejo started a formidable assault on Indian communal land, ostensibly in order to improve agricultural production. He decreed that Indians cold become owners of their parcels if they paid a large fee within sixty days. If they failed to do so, their land would be auctioned off. The resulting land sales increased the size of the haciendas, and massive Indian uprisings against his rule became more violent. Opposition against Melgarejo mounted in all sectors of society as the term melgarejismo came to signify amoral militarism; in 1871 he was overthrown and later murdered in Lima. Agustín Morales (1871–1872) continued Melgarejo's ruling style, despite his promise of \\"more liberty and less government\\". Morales was killed by his nephew in 1872. Two presidents with high integrity, Tomás Frías Ametller (1872–1873) and General Adolfo Ballivián (1873–1874), did not last long because of constant intrigues. Under their rule Bolivia opened the port of Mollendo, which reduced the country's isolation by connecting the Altiplano by train and steamship on Lake Titicaca to the Pacific coast. In 1876 Hilarión Daza (1876–1879) seized power and became another military caudillo, as brutal and incompetent as Melgarejo. He faced many insurrections, a massive demonstration by artisans in Sucre, and widespread opposition. Hoping to gather the support of nationalist Bolivians to strengthen his internal position, Daza involved his country in the disastrous War of the Pacific. War of the Pacific Territorial changes after the War of the Pacific The War of the Pacific resulted from a dispute between Bolivia and Chile over sovereignty of the mineral-rich coastal area of the Atacama Desert. In the mid-1860s the two nations had come to the brink of war because of disagreement over their boundaries there. In 1874 Chile agreed to fix the border at 24° south latitude in return for Bolivia's promise not to increase taxes on Chilean nitrate enterprises for twenty-five years. In 1878 Hilarión Daza imposed a 10 cent tax on every 100 pounds of nitrates exported from Bolivia. British and Chilean owned Nitrates and Railroad Company of Antofagasta objected. Daza initially suspended the tax instead of an annual fee, but then he decided to reimpose the tax. Chileans responded by mobilizing their fleet. When Daza cancelled the mining contract of the company, Chile landed troops in Antofagasta harbor on February 14, 1879.A Brief History of Bolivia Bolivia, in alliance with Peru, declared war on Chile on March 14, but Bolivia's troops in the coastal territory were easily defeated, in part because of Daza's military incompetence. On December 27, 1879 a coup led by Colonel Eliodoro Camacho overthrew Daza, who fled to Europe with a sizable portion of Bolivia's treasury. The attempt of General Narciso Campero (1880–84) to come to the aid of Peru, Bolivia's war ally, was unsuccessful, and the combined armies were defeated by Chile in May 1880. Having lost its entire coastal territory, Bolivia withdrew from the war, while the war between Chile and Peru continued for three more years. Bolivia officially ceded the coastal territory to Chile only twenty-four years later, under the 1904 Treaty of Peace and Friendship.Maria Luise Wagner. \\"War of the Pacific\\". In Hudson & Hanratty. The War of the Pacific was a turning point in Bolivian history. Bolivian politicians were able to rally Bolivians by blaming the war on Chilean aggression. Bolivian writers were convinced that Chile's victory would help Bolivia to overcome its backwardness because the defeat strengthened the \\"national soul\\". Even today, the landlocked Bolivia has not relinquished the hope of regaining an outlet to the Pacific Ocean. Rise of Conservative and Liberal parties After the war, a vigorous debate among the civilian elites spawned the development of two new political parties. Silver mining entrepreneurs, who had become the most important economic group in the country, created the Conservative Party (Partido Conservador) led by Mariano Baptista, a vocal opponent of the War of the Pacific. Conservatives favored reaching a quick peace settlement with Chile that would include a financial indemnity for the lost territories and enable Bolivia to construct a railroad for continued mining exports. The Liberal Party (Partido Liberal) was founded in 1883 by the former chief of staff, General Eliodoro Camacho and was more hawkish, as it denounced the pacifism of the Conservatives and any peace treaty with Chile. Liberals also resented the dependence of the mining industry on Chilean and British capital and hoped to attract United States investments. Conservatives adapted a new Constitution of Bolivia in 1878 which created a unitary state and made Roman Catholicism the state religion, while Liberals championed a secular and federal state model. Despite these differences, both parties were primarily interested in political and economic modernization, and their ideological outlooks were similar. Civilian politicians reorganized, reequipped, and professionalized the discredited armed forces and tried to subject them to civilian control. Still, both Conservatives and Liberals initially supported military candidates for the presidency. The governments in power from 1880 to 1920—elected by a small, literate, and Spanish-speaking electorate of less than 30,000—brought Bolivia its first relative political stability and prosperity. Reconstruction under the rule of the Conservatives, 1880-1899 Gregorio Pacheco, one of Bolivia's most important mine owners, served as President from 1884 to 1888. The Conservatives ruled Bolivia from 1880 until 1899. In 1880 the Constitution of 1878 was reaffirmed and remained in force until 1938. General Campero completed his legal term in office and presided over elections of 1884 that brought to power Gregorio Pacheco (1884–88), leader of the Democratic Party and one of Bolivia's richest mine owners. During this time only 30,000 Bolivians had a right to vote. After Pachecho's term, fraudulent elections resulted in Liberal revolts in October 1888, May 1890 and 1892. Although the Liberal Party was allowed to win seats in the National Congress of Bolivia, it had no chance to win a presidential elections.Maria Luise Wagner. \\"Reconstruction and the rule of the Conservatives\\". In Hudson & Hanratty. Under the Conservatives, the high world price of silver and increased production of copper, lead, zinc, and tin combined to create a period of relative prosperity. The Conservative governments encouraged the mining industry through the development of a rail network to the Pacific coast. The growth of commercial agriculture, such as the development of Bolivia's natural rubber resources, also contributed to a stronger economy. Agricultural production in the highlands increased as the haciendas expanded in some regions. Another millionaire Aniceto Arce (1888–1892), although elected legally in elections of 1888 was an autocrat who managed to stay in power only through repression. His main economic accomplishment was to extend the Antofagasta-Calama Railroad to Oruro. The extension of the railroad drastically reduced the cost of transporting minerals to the Pacific coast. Economic growth was skewed, as railroads that were built to export minerals started to bring imported wheat from Chile; in 1890 Chilean wheat was cheaper in La Paz than wheat from Cochabamba. The open economy also hurt local industry. The expansion of the haciendas at the expense of the free Indian communities resulted in numerous uprisings and forced many Indians to work for their landlords or to migrate to the cities. As a result of this migration, the census of 1900 noted an increase of the mestizo population, but Bolivia remained a predominantly Indian and rural nation, in which the Spanish- speaking minority continued to exclude the Indians. The Liberal Party and the rise of tin, 1899–1920 In 1899 the Liberal Party overthrew the Conservative president Severo Fernández in the \\"Federal Revolution\\". Although the Liberals resented the long rule of the Conservatives, the main reasons for the revolt were regionalism and federalism. The Liberal Party drew most of its support from the tin-mining entrepreneurs in and around La Paz, whereas Conservative governments had ruled with an eye on the interests of the silver mine owners and great landowners in Potosí and Sucre. The immediate cause of the conflict was the Liberal demand to move the capital from Sucre to the more developed La Paz.Maria Luise Wagner. \\"The Liberal Party and the rise of tin\\". In Hudson & Hanratty. Since independence, Bolivia has lost over half of its territory to neighboring countries. Through diplomatic channels in 1909, it lost the basin of the Madre de Dios River and the territory of the Purus in the Amazon, yielding 250,000 km² to Peru The Federal Revolution differed from previous revolts in Bolivia in that Indian peasants actively participated in the fighting. Indian discontent had increased because of the massive assault on their communal landholdings. The campesinos supported the Liberal leader, José Manuel Pando (1899–1904), when he promised to improve their situation. His follower, President Ismael Montes (1904–1909 and 1913–1917) dominated the Liberal era. President Ismael Montes dominated the Liberal era. Pando, however, reneged on his promises and allowed the assault on Indian land to continue. The government suppressed a series of campesino uprisings and executed the leaders. One of these revolts, led by Pablo Zárate (Willka), was one of the largest Indian rebellions in the history of the republic. It frightened whites and mestizos, who once again successfully isolated the Indians from national life. Like their Conservative predecessors, the Liberals controlled the presidential elections but left the elections for the Congress relatively free. They also continued to professionalize the Bolivian military, with the aid of a German military mission. German officers led the School of War and Military College from 1901. German and French artillery was purchased between 1901 and 1907. French military officers were invited between 1907 and 1910 and then once again followed by Germans. In 1907 compulsory military service was introduced. Former head of Germany's mission, Colonel Hans Kundt became the head of the General staff and later Minister of War. Kundt became involved with the Republican Party and provided it with army's loyalty during the 1920 coup after which he purged many Liberal officers. He was later recalled to Bolivia in 1932 to lead army during the Chaco War.For la Patria: Politics and the Armed Forces in Latin America Liberal administrations gave priority to the settlement of border disputes. Bolivia's inability to protect and integrate the frontier with Brazil had led to the encroachment of Brazilian rubber gatherers. In 1900 they began an active secessionist movement in the eastern province of Acre and after three years of small-scale fighting were annexed by Brazil. In the Treaty of Petropolis in 1903, Bolivia relinquished its claims to 191,000 square kilometers of Acre territory in return for two areas on the Madeira and the Paraguay rivers totaling 5,200 square kilometers, the equivalent of US$10 million, and the use of a railroad to be constructed around the rapids of the Madeira in Brazilian territory. In 1904 Bolivia finally concluded a peace treaty with Chile under which it officially ceded Bolivia's former territory on the Pacific coast in return for indemnification of US$8.5 million, less the value of the Bolivian section of a new railroad that Chile would construct from La Paz to the Pacific Coast at Arica. The payment was used to expand the transportation system in Bolivia. By 1920 most major Bolivian cities were connected by rail. Liberal governments also changed the seat of government and the nature of church-state relations. The presidency and the Congress were moved to La Paz, which became the de facto capital, but the Supreme Court remained in Sucre. Liberal presidents canceled the special privileges officially granted to the Roman Catholic Church, in 1905 they legalized public worship by other faiths, and in 1911 they made civil marriage a requirement. Perhaps the most significant development of the Liberal era was the dramatic rise of Bolivian tin production. Since the colonial period, tin had been mined in the Potosí region; nonetheless, Bolivia historically lacked the transportation system necessary to ship large quantities of tin to European markets. The extension of the rail link to Oruro in the 1890s, however, made tin mining a highly profitable business. The decline in European tin production also contributed to the Bolivian tin boom at the beginning of the 20th century. With the development of huge mines in southern Oruro and northern Potosí, La Paz eclipsed Potosí as the mining industry's financial and service center. Tin production in Bolivia came to be concentrated in the hands of Bolivian nationals, although the regimes encouraged foreign investment. At first, foreign interests and Bolivians with foreign associations took the major share. This changed, however, when Bolivian tin-mining entrepreneurs realized that smelters in competing countries depended on Bolivian tin. Simón Patiño was the most successful of these tin magnates. Of poor mestizo background, he started as a mining apprentice. By 1924 he owned 50% of the national production and controlled the European refining of Bolivian tin. Although Patiño lived permanently abroad by the early 1920s, the two other leading tin- mining entrepreneurs, Carlos Aramayo and Mauricio Hochschild, resided primarily in Bolivia. Because taxes and fees from tin production were critically important to national revenues, Patiño, Aramayo, and Hochschild exercised considerable influence over government policy. Unlike the silver- mining entrepreneurs of the Conservative period, the tin-mining magnates did not directly intervene in politics but employed politicians and lawyers—known as the rosca—to represent their interests. The tin boom also contributed to increased social tensions. Indian peasants, who provided most of the labor for the mines, moved from their rural communities to the rapidly growing mining towns, where they lived and worked in precarious situations. Bolivia's First National Congress of Workers met in La Paz in 1912, and in the following years the mining centers witnessed an increasing number of strikes. Liberal governments at first did not face any serious opposition because the Conservative Party remained weak after its overthrow in 1899. By 1915 a faction of Liberals (including ex-president Pando) who were opposed to the loss of national territory, split from the Liberal party and formed the Republican Party (Partido Republicano). Republican support increased when mineral exports declined because of the crisis in international trade before World War I, and agricultural production decreased because of severe droughts. In 1917 the Republicans were defeated at the polls when José Gutiérrez Guerra (1917–20) was elected as the last Liberal president. The rule of the Liberals, one of the most stable periods in Bolivian history, ended when the Republicans led by Bautista Saavedra seized the presidency in a bloodless coup of 1920.

Great loss of life and territory discredited the traditional ruling classes, while service in the army produced stirrings of political awareness among the indigenous people. A large portion of the contested Gran Chaco region was surrendered to Paraguay. In return Bolivia was given access to the Paraguay River where Puerto Busch was founded and, with this, free access to the Atlantic Ocean through international waters was possible. In 1936 Standard Oil's Bolivian operations were nationalized and the state-owned firm Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) was created. From the end of the Chaco War until the 1952 Bolivian National Revolution, the emergence of contending ideologies and the demands of new groups convulsed Bolivian politics. During World War II and the Korean War Bolivian tin had enjoyed high demand and prices. Even as the quality of the ores fell, the U.S. built a smelter able to handle low grade Bolivian ores and continued to buy Bolivian tin. Following the nationalization of the mines, with the Korean War over, tin prices fell and the U.S. no longer needed tin to support a war effort. Additionally, when the mines were nationalized, the foreign mining engineers and managers left the country, leaving the mines with a lack of skilled replacement.Richard S. Thorn, \\"The Economic Transformation,\\" In Beyond the Revolution: Bolivia Since 1952, James M. Malloy and Richard S. Thorn, eds, University of Pittsburgh Press, 1971, p. 173. The Republican Party and the Great Depression The Liberal Party's long rule of Bolivia, one of the most stable periods in the country's history, ended when the Republicans seized the presidency in a bloodless coup d'état in 1920. Fernando Díez de Medina, a Bolivian writer, commented on the change: \\"Twenty years of privilege for one group ends, and ten years of privilege for another begins.\\" Republican Party soon split into two parties - one led by Bautista Saavedra with his Republican Socialist Party and another led by Daniel Salamanca, who established the Genuine Republican Party. Saavedra, President between 1920 and 1925, had the support of the urban middle class, while Salamanca was more conservative. A number of minor political parties influenced by socialist or Marxist thought also emerged.Maria Luise Wagner. \\"The Republican Party and the Great Depression\\". In Hudson & Hanratty. During the Republican rule the Bolivian economy underwent a profound change. Tin prices started to decline in the 1920s. After peaking in 1929, tin production declined dramatically as the Great Depression nearly destroyed the international tin market. This decline was also caused by the decrease in the tin content of ore and the end of new investment in the mines in Bolivia. As economic growth slowed, Republican presidents relied on foreign loans. Saavedra (1920–25) and Hernando Siles Reyes (1926–30) borrowed heavily in the United States to finance major development projects, despite opposition by Bolivian nationalists to the favorable terms for the lender. The so-called Nicolaus loan aroused national indignation because it gave the United States control over Bolivia's tax collections in return for a private banking loan of US$33 million. The rule of the Republican Party and its President Saavedra initially did not indicate any profound changes in Bolivian politics. The 1920s, however, was a period of political change. During the 1920s Bolivia faced growing social turmoil. Saavedra legalized the right to strike and introduced government arbitration in labour disputes. In 1922 he caused a general strike after banning night taxis. The strikers won and taxi services were resumed and railroad federation was recognized as representative of railroad workers.Bolivia: The Uncompleted Revolution Labor unrest, such as the miners' strike in Uncia in 1923, was brutally suppressed. The unrest reached new heights of violence after the drastic reduction of the work force during the Great Depression. Indian peasants continued to rebel in the countryside, although they had been disarmed and their leaders had been executed after participating in the overthrow of the Conservative Party in 1899. Now, for the first time, the Indians found support for their cause among the elite. Gustavo Navarro, who took the name Tristan Marof, was Bolivia's most important Indianist. He saw in the Inca past the first successful socialism and the model to solve rural problems. As Indian uprisings continued during the Liberal rule, Siles Reyes promised to improve their situation and organized the National Crusade in Favor of Indians. The social legislation of the Republican governments was weak, however, because neither Saavedra nor Siles Reyes wanted to challenge the rosca (tin mining magnates' political representatives). Siles Reyes's four years of inconsistent rule and unfulfilled promises of radical changes frustrated workers and students. In 1930 he was overthrown when he tried to bypass the constitutional provision forbidding reelection by resigning in order to run again. A military junta ruled until March 1931, when Republican leader Daniel Salamanca (1931–34) was elected as a candidate of Republican and Liberal coalition. Although he was an esteemed economist before taking office, Salamanca was unable to suppress social unrest and to solve the severe economic problems caused by the Great Depression. Criticism of his administration mounted in all sectors of Bolivian society. Initially reluctant to enter into an armed conflict with Paraguay, he nevertheless led Bolivia into Chaco war, a move supported by the military and traditional groups. The Chaco War (1932-1935)  upright The Chaco War originated in a long-standing dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay over the Gran Chaco region. This vast area was largely undeveloped except for some minor oil discoveries by Standard Oil in Bolivia and by Royal Dutch Shell in Paraguay. The Chaco, which Bolivia traditionally regarded as its province, became more significant to Bolivia after it lost its Pacific coastline to Chile in 1880. Bolivia hoped to gain access to the Atlantic Ocean with an oil pipeline across the Chaco to the Paraguay River. Despite mediation attempts by various countries, the increased number of border incidents led the military high commands of Bolivia and Paraguay to prepare for the inevitability of war.Maria Luise Wagner. \\"The Chaco War\\". In Hudson & Hanratty. President Salamanca used one of the border incidents to break diplomatic relations with Paraguay and to increase Bolivia's military budget, even though the country had severe economic problems. Convinced that Bolivia's better-equipped, German-trained troops, which outnumbered the Paraguayan army, could win the war, Salamanca went to war in September 1932. The war raged for the next three years. The Bolivians suffered defeat in all major battles, and by the end of 1934 they had been driven back 482 kilometers from their original positions deep in the Chaco to the foothills of the Andes. Serious strategic errors, poor intelligence, and logistical problems in reaching the distant battle-lines contributed to the losses. In addition, the morale of the Bolivian troops was low, and the highland Indian troops could not adapt to the extreme climate in the low-lying Chaco. Despite the high command's decision to end the war, Salamanca was determined to continue at all costs. In 1934, when he traveled to the Chaco to take personal command over the war, Salamanca was arrested by the high command and forced to resign. His vice-president, José Luis Tejada Sorzano, who was known to favor peace, was installed as president (1934–36). Salamanca's overthrow proved a turning-point in the Chaco War. The Paraguayan troops were stopped by new, more capable Bolivian officers, who fought closer to Bolivian supply lines. On June 14, 1935 a commission of neutral nations (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru and the United States) declared an armistice; a definite settlement was finally reached in 1938. Bolivia lost the Chaco but retained the petroleum fields, which Paraguay had failed to reach. Both countries suffered heavy losses in the war. Bolivia lost an estimated 65,000 people killed and 35,000 wounded or captured out of a population of just under 3 million. The humiliating disaster of the Chaco War had a profound impact in Bolivia, which saw the conflict as a watershed event in the history of the 20th century. The traditional oligarchy was discredited because of its inept civilian and military leadership in the war. Unable to deal with growing criticism, its members blamed the loss of the war on the low potential of the Bolivians and saw the earlier pessimistic assessment in Alcides Arguedas's famous novel Pueblo Enfermo (A Sick People) confirmed. After the war, a group of middle-class professionals, writers, and young officers questioned the traditional leadership. This group, which came to be known as the Chaco Generation, searched for new ways to deal with the nation's problems. It resented the service of the rosca on behalf of the tin-mining entrepreneurs and criticized Standard Oil Co., which had delivered oil to Paraguay clandestinely through Argentine intermediaries during the war. The Chaco Generation was convinced of the need for social change. Gustavo Navarro, now more radical than during the 1920s, proclaimed the famous slogan \\"land to the Indians, mines to the state\\". The military, which came to power in 1936, tried to bring about change with popular support. Prelude to the National Revolution, 1935–52 Radical military government On May 17, 1936 Colonel David Toro Ruilova (1936–37) overthrew President Tejada in a military coup. Because the officer corps wanted to avoid a civilian investigation of the military's wartime leadership, backing for the coup came from all ranks. The main backers were a group of younger officers who wanted to bring profound change to Bolivia. Toro, the leader of this group, hoped to reform the country from the top down. His program of \\"military socialism\\" included social and economic justice and government control over natural resources. He also planned to set up a corporate-style political system to replace the democratic system established in 1825.Maria Luise Wagner. \\"Radical military government\\". In Hudson & Hanratty. Toro attempted to get civilian support with far-reaching social legislation and nominated a print worker as the first labor secretary in Bolivia. He also nationalized the holdings of Standard Oil without compensation and called for the convening of a constitutional congress that would include the traditional parties, as well as new reformist groups and the labor movement. Toro was unable to secure a lasting popular support. A group of more radical officers resented his reluctance to challenge the rosca, and they supported a coup by Colonel Germán Busch Becerra (1937–39) in 1937. A new constitution was promulgated in 1938, stressing the primacy of the common good over private property and favored government intervention in social and economic relations. It also legalized the Indian communities and included a labor code. In 1939 Busch challenged the interests of the mine owners for the first time by issuing a decree that would prevent the mining companies from removing capital from the country. None of his policies, however, resulted in significant popular and military support, and completely alienated the conservative forces. Frustrated by his inability to bring about change, Busch committed suicide in 1939. Despite the weakness of the Toro and Busch regimes, their policies had a profound impact on Bolivia. Reformist decrees raised expectations among the middle class, but when they failed to be implemented, they contributed to the growth of the left. The constitutional convention gave the new forces for the first time a nationwide platform and the possibility of forming alliances. The military socialist regimes also prompted the conservatives to join forces to stem the growth of the left. The rise of new political groups After a few months under the provisional presidency of General Carlos Quintanilla (1939–40), the chief of staff during the Busch regime, General Enrique Peñaranda Castillo (1940–43) was elected president in the spring of 1940. Peñaranda's support came from the traditional parties, the Liberals, and the two wings of the Republicans, who had formed a concordancia to stem the growth of the movement toward further reforms.Maria Luise Wagner. \\"The rise of new political groups\\". In Hudson & Hanratty. The trend toward reform, however, could not be halted, and a number of new groups gained control of the Congress during Peñaranda's presidency. These groups, although very different in their ideological outlooks, agreed on the need to change the status quo. They included the Trotskyite Revolutionary Workers Party (Partido Obrero Revolucionario, POR), which had already been formed in 1934, as well as the Bolivian Socialist Falange (Falange Socialista Boliviana, FSB), founded in 1937 and patterned on the Spanish Falange. The Leftist Revolutionary Party (Partido de Izquierda Revolucionaria, PIR) was founded in 1940 by a coalition of radical Marxist groups. The rise of MNR The most important opposition to the concordancia came from the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario, MNR). The first party with widespread support in Bolivian history, the MNR had a membership that included intellectuals and both white-collar and blue-collar workers. It was founded in 1941 by a small group of intellectual dissidents from the middle and upper classes and represented persons from a wide range of political persuasions who were united by their discontent with the status quo. Among its leaders were Víctor Paz Estenssoro, a professor of economics; Hernán Siles Zuazo, the son of former President Siles Reyes; and several influential writers. The party's program included nationalization of all of Bolivia's natural resources and far-reaching social reforms. Its anti-Semitic statements resulted not only in the imprisonment of MNR leaders but also in charges by the United States government that MNR was under the influence of Nazis. As the leader of the congressional opposition, the MNR denounced Peñaranda's close cooperation with the United States and was especially critical of his agreement to compensate Standard Oil for its nationalized holdings. The MNR members of the Congress also began an investigation of the Catavi Massacre of striking miners and their families by government troops at one of the Patiño mines in Catavi in 1942. MNR influence with the miners increased when Paz Estenssoro led the congressional interrogation of government ministers. The MNR had contacts with reformist military officers, who were organized in a secret military lodge named the Fatherland's Cause (Razón de Patria, Radepa). Radepa was founded in 1934 by Bolivian prisoners of war in Paraguay. It sought mass support, backed military intervention in politics, and hoped to prevent excessive foreign control over Bolivia's natural resources. In December 1943 the Radepa-MNR alliance overthrew the Peñaranda regime. Major Gualberto Villarroel López (1943–46) became president, and three MNR members, including Paz Estenssoro, joined his cabinet. The MNR ministers resigned, however, when the United States refused to grant its recognition, repeating its charge of ties between the MNR and Nazi Germany. The ministers returned to their posts in 1944, after the party had won a majority in the election and the United States had recognized the government. Villarroel's government emphasized continuity with the reformist regimes of Toro and Busch. Paz Estenssoro, who served as minister of finance, hoped to get popular support with a budget that emphasized social spending over economic development. But the salary increase for miners did not bring about their consistent backing of the government and only managed to strengthen the ties between the MNR and miners. The Villarroel government also tried for the first time to get the support of the campesinos. In 1945 it created the National Indigenous Congress to discuss the problems in the countryside and to improve the situation of the peasants. However, most of the social legislation, such as the abolition of the labor obligation of the campesinos to their landlords, was never put in effect. Villarroel was overthrown in 1946. He had been unable to organize popular support and faced opposition from conservative groups and increasing political terrorism that included murders of the government's opponents. Rivalry between the MNR and the military in the governing coalition also contributed to his downfall. In 1946 mobs of students, teachers, and workers seized arms from the arsenal and moved to the presidential palace. They captured and shot Villarroel and suspended his body from a lamppost in the main square, while the army remained aloof in the barracks. The sexenio, 1946–52 The six years preceding the 1952 National Revolution are known as the sexenio. During this period, members of the Conservative Party tried to stem the growth of the left, but they ultimately failed, because they could not halt the economic decline and control the growing social unrest. Enrique Hertzog Garaizabal (1947–49), who was elected president in 1947 after the interim rule of a provisional junta, formed a coalition cabinet that included not only the concordancia but also the PIR. He hoped to retain the backing of the Conservative Party forces by not increasing taxes, but he tried also to gain labor support, relying on the PIR to mobilize the workers.Maria Luise Wagner. \\"The sexenio (1946–52)\\". In Hudson & Hanratty. The labor sector did not cooperate with the government and the PIR became discredited because of its alliance with the conservative forces. In 1946 the workers endorsed the Thesis of Pulacayo, in which the miners called for permanent revolution and violent armed struggle for the working class. As the labor sector became more radical, the government resorted more and more to oppression, and confrontations increased. The dismissal of 7,000 miners and the brutal suppression of yet another uprising in Catavi in 1949 made any cooperation between the government and the workers impossible. The MNR emerged as the dominant opposition group. Although most of its leaders, including Paz Estenssoro, were in exile in Argentina, the party continued to be represented in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. During the sexenio, the party, despite its predominantly middle-class background, repeatedly took the side of the workers and adopted their radical ideology. The MNR also came to support the defense of Indian rights, as violence in the countryside increased when the promises given at the National Indigenous Congress were not fulfilled. The MNR's attempts to gain power during the sexenio were unsuccessful. Its 1949 coup attempt failed, although with the support of the workers and some military officers it succeeded in gaining control of most major cities except La Paz. The MNR's attempt to gain power by legal means in 1951 also failed. In the presidential election of May 1951, the MNR's Paz Estenssoro, who remained in exile in Argentina, ran for president and Siles Zuazo ran for vice president, both on a platform of nationalization and land reform. With the support of the POR and the newly formed Bolivian Communist Party (Partido Comunista de Bolivia, PCB), the MNR won with a clear plurality. The outgoing president persuaded the military to step in and prevent the MNR from taking power. Mamerto Urriolagoitia Harriague (1949–51), who succeeded the ailing Hertzog in 1949, backed a military junta under General Hugo Ballivián Rojas (1951–52). Under Ballivián, the government made a last futile attempt to suppress the growing unrest throughout the country. By 1952 the Bolivian economy had deteriorated even further. The governments of the sexenio had been reluctant to increase taxes for the upper class and to reduce social spending, resulting in high inflation. The tin industry had stagnated since the Great Depression, despite short revivals during World War II. Ore content had declined, and the richer veins were depleted, increasing tin production costs; at the same time, tin prices on the international market fell. A disagreement with the United States over tin prices halted exports temporarily and caused a decline in income that further hurt the economy. The agricultural sector lacked capital, and food imports had increased, reaching 19% of total imports in 1950. Land was unequally distributed - 92% of the cultivable land was held by estates of 1,000 hectares or more. The social unrest that resulted from this economic decline increased during the last weeks before the 1952 National Revolution, when a hunger march through La Paz attracted most sectors of society. The military was severely demoralized, and the high command called unsuccessfully for unity in the armed forces; many officers assigned themselves abroad, charged each other with coup attempts, or deserted. The Bolivian National Revolution, 1952 By the beginning of 1952 the MNR again tried to gain power by force, plotting with General Antonio Seleme, the junta member in control of internal administration and the National Police (Policía Nacional). On April 9, the MNR launched the rebellion in La Paz by seizing arsenals and distributing arms to civilians. Armed miners marched on La Paz and blocked troops on their way to reinforce the city. After three days of fighting, the desertion of Seleme, and the loss of some 600 lives, the army surrendered and Paz Estenssoro assumed the presidency on April 16, 1952. Radical reforms The \\"reluctant revolutionaries\\", as the leaders of the multiclass MNR were called by some, looked more to Mexico than to the Soviet Union for example. But during the first year of Paz Estenssoro's presidency, the radical faction in the party, which had gained strength during the sexenio when the party embraced the workers and their ideology, forced the MNR leaders to act quickly. In July 1952, the government established universal suffrage, with neither literacy nor property requirements. In the first postrevolutionary elections in 1956 the population of eligible voters increased from approximately 200,000 to nearly 1 million. The government also moved quickly to control the armed forces, purging many officers associated with past Conservative Party regimes and drastically reducing the forces' size and budget. The government also closed the Military Academy (Colegio Militar) and required that officers take an oath to the MNR.Maria Luise Wagner. \\"Radical reforms\\". In Hudson & Hanratty. The government then began the process of nationalizing all mines of the three great tin companies. First, it made the export and sale of all minerals a state monopoly to be administered by the state-owned Mining Bank of Bolivia (Banco Minero de Bolivia, Bamin). Then it set up the Mining Corporation of Bolivia (Corporación Minera de Bolivia, Comibol) as a semi-autonomous enterprise to run state-owned mines. On October 31, 1952 the government nationalized the three big tin companies, leaving the medium-sized mines untouched, and promising compensation. In this process, two-thirds of Bolivia's mining industry was turned over to Comibol. A far- reaching agrarian reform was the final important step taken by the revolutionary government. In January 1953, the government established the Agrarian Reform Commission, using advisers from Mexico, and decreed the Agrarian Reform Law the following August. During the first years of the revolution, miners wielded extraordinary influence within the government. This influence was based on miners' decisive role in the fighting of April 1952. In addition, armed militias of miners formed by the government to counterbalance the military had become a powerful force in their own right. Miners immediately organized the Bolivian Labor Federation (Central Obrera Boliviana, COB), which demanded radical change as well as participation in the government and benefits for its members. MNR eventually gained the support of the campesinos when the Ministry of Peasant Affairs was created and when peasants were organized into syndicates. Peasants were not only granted land but their militias also were given large supplies of arms. The country faced severe economic problems as a result of the changes enacted by the government. High inflation, caused by increased social spending, also hurt the economy. The value of the peso fell from 60 to 12,000 to the United States dollar between 1952 and 1956, affecting primarily the urban middle class, which began to support the opposition.Maria Luise Wagner. \\"The unfinished revolution\\". In Hudson & Hanratty. The bankrupt economy increased the factionalism within the MNR. Whereas the left wing demanded more government control over the economy, the right wing hoped to solve the nation's problems with aid from the United States. During the presidency of Hernán Siles Zuazo (1956–60), who won the election with 84% of the vote, United States aid reached its highest level. In 1957 the United States subsidized more than 30% of the Bolivian budget. Siles Zuazo's stabilization plan seriously damaged the coalition of MNR and COB. The COB called immediately for a general strike, which threatened to destroy an already disrupted economy; the strike was called off only after impassioned appeals by the president. In an effort to quell the unrest, Zuazo decided to rebuild the armed forces. During his administration the strength of the armed forces grew as a result of a new concern for professionalism and training, technical assistance from the United States, and an increase in the size and budget of the military. In addition, the military's role in containing unrest gave it increasing influence within the MNR government. Conflicts within the MNR increased during Paz Estenssoro's second term of 1960–64. Together with the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Inter-American Development Bank, Paz Estenssoro endorsed the \\"Triangular Plan\\", which called for a restructuring of the tin-mining industry. The plan demanded the end of the workers' control over Comibol operations, the firing of workers, and a reduction in their salaries and benefits; it was strongly opposed by the COB and Lechín's MNR faction. In 1964 Paz Estenssoro decided to run again for president, and accepted General René Barrientos Ortuño as vice presidential candidate. Because most opposition groups abstained, Paz Estenssoro was reelected with the support of the military and the peasants. Paz Estenssoro had come to rely increasingly on the military, whose role as a peacekeeper had made it an arbiter in politics. But this support was to prove unreliable; the military was already planning to overthrow him. References Notes  Works cited * Rex A. Hudson and Dennis M. Hanratty. Bolivia: a country study.

On November 4, 1964 power passed from the elected leader of the Bolivian National Revolution, Víctor Paz Estenssoro to a military junta under vice-president General René Barrientos. Barrientos was elected president in 1966, but died accidentally in a helicopter crash in 1969, leading to a coup in September 1969 by General Ovando, who was overthrown in October 1970 by General Rogelio Miranda who was overthrown a couple of days later by General J.J.Torres, who in turn was overthrown on August 1971 by Hugo Banzer Suárez. Banzer ruled for seven years, initially from 1971 to 1974 with the support of Estenssoro's Nationalist Revolutionary Movement. In 1974, impatient with schisms in the party, he replaced civilians with members of the armed forces and suspended political activities. The economy grew impressively during Banzer's presidency, but demands for greater political freedom undercut his support. He called elections in 1978 and Bolivia once again plunged into turmoil. Juan Pereda ruled for only four months in 1978, but his ascent to the presidency marked the beginning of an even more unstable period in Bolivian history, with nine civilian and military presidents in little over four years (1978–1982). 1982 marked the return to a democratically elected government, with Guido Vildoso as president. The Barrientos presidency upright On November 4, 1964 René Barrientos Ortuño (president, 1964–65; co-president, May 1965 – January 1966; and president, 1966–69) and General Alfredo Ovando Candia occupied the presidential palace and declared themselves co-presidents. But as the crowd, which had gathered outside the palace, persisted in shouting its preference for the more charismatic Barrientos, Ovando allowed Barrientos to assume the formal title alone, while he occupied the post of commander in chief of the armed forces.Maria Luise Wagner. \\"The Barrientos presidency\\". In Hudson & Hanratty. Barrientos insisted that his assumption of power was not a counterrevolutionary move and promised to restore the Bolivian National Revolution to its \\"true path\\", from which the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario, MNR) had deviated during its twelve-year rule. His government continued many of the policies of the second Víctor Paz Estenssoro administration, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) stabilization plan and the Triangular Plan. The emphasis on reducing social costs remained in effect. In May 1965, the army forced Barrientos to accept Ovando as his co-president as a reward for suppressing an uprising by miners and factory workers. The economy improved during the Barrientos regime at a growth rate averaging 6.5% per year. The rise of tin prices resulted in the first profit for the Mining Corporation of Bolivia (Corporación Minera de Bolivia, Comibol) in 1966 and contributed to increased production in the medium-sized mines that had remained in private hands. Barrientos encouraged the private sector and foreign investment and gave Gulf Oil Company permission to export petroleum and natural gas from Bolivia. In 1966 Barrientos legitimized his rule by winning the presidential election. He formed the Popular Christian Movement (Movimiento Popular Cristiano, MPC) as his base of support. Although the MPC was not very successful, he won the election with a coalition of conservative politicians, the business community, and the peasants. Barrientos's efforts to build support in the countryside succeeded at first with the signing in February 1964 of the Military-Peasant Pact (Pacto Militar-Campesino). Under the agreement, the campesino militias agreed to adopt an anti-leftist stance and to subordinate themselves to the army. But his attempt to impose taxes on peasants resulted in a violent response and loss of support in rural areas. Determined to keep the labor sector under control, Barrientos took away most of the gains it had achieved during the MNR's rule. He placed Comibol under the control of a military director and abolished the veto power of union leaders in management decisions. The president also cut the pay of the miners to the equivalent of US$0.80 a day and reduced the mining work force and the enormous Comibol bureaucracy by 10%. Finally, he destroyed the Bolivian Labor Federation (Central Obrera Boliviana, COB) and the mine workers' union, suppressed all strike activity, disarmed the miners' militias, and exiled union leaders. Military troops again occupied the mines, and in 1967 they massacred miners and their families at the Catavi-Siglo XX mines. Barrientos could not completely silence the labor sector; miners led the growing opposition to his rule. The various groups opposing his rule joined in denouncing Barrientos's selling of natural resources to the United States under favorable terms. They resented his invitation to United States private investment in Bolivia because he offered greater privileges to foreign investors. The defection of Barrientos's close friend and minister of interior, Colonel Antonio Arguedas, to Cuba after his announcement that he had been an agent for the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) aroused national indignation. The military also resented the key role of United States officers in the capture and killing of Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara in 1967 in Bolivia, where he had tried to start a guerrilla movement. The death of Barrientos in a helicopter crash on April 27, 1969, initially left control in the hands of his vice president, Luís Adolfo Siles Salinas (1969). Real power, however, remained with the armed forces under its commander in chief, General Ovando, who took power on September 26, 1969, in a coup that was supported by reformist officers. Revolutionary nationalism: Ovando and Torres Ovando (co-president, May 1965 – January 1966, and president, January–August 1966 and 1969–70) annulled the elections scheduled for 1970, dismissed the Congress, and appointed a cabinet that included independent reformist civilians who had opposed the policies of Barrientos. Ovando hoped to gain civilian and military support with a program of \\"revolutionary nationalism\\", which he had outlined in the \\"Revolutionary Mandate of the Armed Forces\\". Revolutionary nationalism reflected the heritage and rhetoric of the military reformist regimes of the past, as well as the spirit of the 1952 Revolution. It also showed the influence of the Peruvian government of General Juan Velasco Alvarado. Many Bolivian officers believed that the military had to intervene in politics to lead the country toward reform because civilian governments had failed in that undertaking. They were convinced that it was in the main interest of the armed forces to end underdevelopment, which they saw as the cause of insurgency. The military would therefore fight on the internal frontiers against social injustice and economic dependence.Maria Luise Wagner. \\"Revolutionary nationalism: Ovando and Torres\\". In Hudson & Hanratty. Despite highly popular measures, such as the nationalization of the holdings of the Gulf Oil Company, Ovando failed to gain popular support. Popular enthusiasm over the nationalization was short lived. Disagreement over compensation, a boycott of Bolivian crude oil on the international market, and a general downturn in the economy became divisive factors. Even though Ovando legalized the COB and withdrew troops from the mining camps, lasting worker support for the regime was not ensured. Frustrated expectations, broken promises, and the massacre of miners by the military in Catavi in 1967 had radicalized the workers, who now refused to cooperate with the military government. While the left became radicalized, the right became weary of Ovando's vacillating statements, which included the suggestion that private property be abolished. Even when Ovando moved right during the last months of his regime, he was unable to enlist the support of the conservative groups in the country because this move only emphasized his weakness. Ovando's reform program also polarized the military. Reformist officers, concerned about the decline in popular support for the military since the Barrientos regime, shifted their support to the more radical General Juan José Torres González (1970–71), whom Ovando had dismissed as his commander in chief; the right backed General Rogelio Miranda. The chaos surrounding the overthrow of Ovando highlighted the division in the armed forces. Military officers demanded the resignation of Ovando and Miranda after a failed coup attempt by the latter on October 5, 1970. A triumvirate, formed on October 6, failed to consolidate support. On October 7, as the country moved toward civil war after the COB had declared a general strike, General Torres emerged as the compromise candidate and became president of Bolivia. The main feature of Torres's presidency was a lack of authority. Rather than taking the initiative on policies, Torres primarily reacted to pressure from different groups. His minister of interior, Jorge Gallardo Lozada, labeled the Torres government the \\"ten months of emergency\\". Torres hoped to retain civilian support by moving to the left. He nationalized some United States property, such as the waste-processing operation of the Catavi tin mines and the Matilde zinc mine, and he ordered the Peace Corps, a United States program, out of Bolivia. While limiting United States influence in Bolivia, Torres increased cooperation with the Soviet Union and its allies in the economic and technical sectors. Because of his lack of a clear strategy and political experience, however, Torres soon alienated all sectors of Bolivian society. He found it very difficult to organize groups on the left because they confronted him with demands that he could not meet, such as giving them half of all cabinet seats. The workers, students, and parties of the left wanted a socialist state and saw the Torres government only as a step in that direction. In June 1970, the Torres regime established the Popular Assembly (Asamblea Popular) in an attempt to form an alternative popular government. Consisting mainly of representatives of workers' and peasants' organizations, the Popular Assembly was intended to serve as a base for the radical transformation of society. However, the left remained divided by ideological differences and rivalry for leadership. They could not agree on controversial issues dealing with full worker participation in state and private enterprises, the creation of armed militias, and the establishment of popular tribunals having legal jurisdiction over crimes against the working class. No consensus was achieved, and many delegates, resenting the lack of power to enforce the resolutions and running short of funds, returned home prematurely. The Popular Assembly did, however, succeed in weakening the government by creating a climate in which popular organizations acted independently from the state. Torres's hope of placating conservative opposition by avoiding radical change did not win him the support of the right, especially of the powerful business community. Conservative groups unified in their opposition because they saw a chance for a political comeback in alliance with rightist officers. The military, in turn, became increasingly polarized because of their discontent with Torres's chaotic leadership. Torres had cut the defense budget to free money for education and allowed civilian interference in strictly military matters. He often permitted military disobedience to go unpunished. The last step of institutional decay was a manifesto written during the last weeks of the Torres regime by a group of junior officers who questioned military authority. It resulted in widespread military support for the coup on August 21, 1971, by Colonel Hugo Banzer Suárez, the former Military Academy commander whom Torres had exiled. The Banzer regime Colonel Hugo Banzer Suárez (1971–78), a highly respected officer who had repeatedly attempted to overthrow the regime of Juan José Torres González, ruled for six years, one of the longest continuous presidential term in recent Bolivian history. Banzer's presidency was characterized by relative political stability and unprecedented economic growth. At first he was supported by the Nationalist Popular Front (Frente Popular Nacionalista, FPN), an alliance between the MNR under Paz Estenssoro, who was allowed to return from exile in Lima, and the Bolivian Socialist Falange (Falange Socialista Boliviana, FSB) under Mario Gutiérrez. Both parties had been enemies until the chaos of the Torres regime gave them a chance for a political comeback in alliance with conservative elements in the armed forces.Maria Luise Wagner. \\"The Banzer regime\\". In Hudson & Hanratty. During the first years of the Banzer presidency the economy improved rapidly. Exports tripled between 1970 and 1974 because of increased production of petroleum, natural gas, and tin, which was then refined in Bolivian smelters. The production of cotton in the Santa Cruz area in eastern Bolivia also tripled between 1970 and 1975. Despite this economic growth, Bolivia reverted to the repression of earlier regimes. The new minister of interior, Colonel Andrés Sélich ordered a massive crackdown on the left, abolishing labor unions and closing the universities. The government brutally suppressed a general strike against the devaluation of the Bolivian peso in 1972. In 1974 price increases for basic goods and control of food prices resulted in roadblocks by peasants in the Cochabamba Valley and their subsequent massacre by the military. The governing alliance disintegrated almost immediately when the MNR and the FSB split. They proved an unreliable support for Banzer because only small factions remained in the FPN. The armed forces were also divided, and various factions tried to overthrow the regime. On June 5, 1974 younger officers belonging to the Generational Group (Grupo Generacional) and led by General Gary Prado Salmón attempted a coup, demanding that Banzer legitimize his rule. It failed, however, as did another on November 7 that was supported by military, MNR, and FSB elements in Santa Cruz. The November 7, 1974 coup has been called an auto-golpe (self-coup) because it gave Banzer a reason to rule without civilian interference. Influenced by the Brazilian model, he announced the complete reorganization of the Bolivian political system and the formation of a \\"new Bolivia\\" under military rule. Banzer hoped to keep the support of the business community, the mine owners, the agricultural entrepreneurs in Santa Cruz, and the growing number of loyal bureaucrats. The government, however, soon began to face serious problems. The \\"economic miracle\\" turned out to be a myth, the production of petroleum declined sharply, and Comibol produced at a loss, despite high mineral prices, because it was subsidizing other state agencies. Cotton production also declined when world prices fell. The stability of the Banzer regime was superficial because the military remained divided by personal rivalry, ideological differences, and a generational gap. Growing civilian opposition was centered in the labor sector, despite the renewed military occupation of the mines. Radical students and the progressive sector of the Roman Catholic Church became spokespersons for the oppressed groups; the peasants also criticized the government. External factions contributed to the weakening of the Banzer regime as well. The negotiation with Chile for an outlet to the sea had raised hopes in 1974. When an agreement between Banzer and General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte failed because of the opposition of Chilean nationalists, Banzer's position was weakened. After Jimmy Carter assumed the United States presidency in 1976, the United States pressured Banzer to hold elections. In 1977, with opposition from civilian groups and the military mounting and pressure from the United States increasing, Banzer announced a presidential election for 1980, hoping to remain in control, but labor unrest and hostility to his regime forced him to set the date for 1978. General Juan Pereda Asbún, Banzer's handpicked candidate, carried out a coup in July 1978 after the National Electoral Court annulled the elections because of widespread fraud by Pereda's supporters. Although Bolivia continued under military rule, the 1978 general election marked the beginning of Bolivia's traumatic transition to democracy during the following four years. Transition to democracy Between 1978 and 1980, Bolivia was constantly in a state of crisis. The fragmentation of political forces made it impossible for any party to dominate. In the three elections held during this period, no party achieved a majority, and alliances of various groups could not break the deadlock. Social unrest increased as peasants began to agitate again on a large scale for the first time since their rebellion in the late colonial period. The Bolivian workers were more radical than ever, and in 1979, during the first congress of the Bolivian Labor Federation (Central Obrera Boliviana, COB) since 1970, they vehemently protested the economic austerity measures dictated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).Maria Luise Wagner. \\"Transition to democracy\\". In Hudson & Hanratty. The division in the armed forces and the increasing visibility of paramilitary groups reflected the institutional decay of the military. A civilian investigation into human rights violations committed during the Banzer regime further demoralized the officer corps. After four months in office, General Pereda did not call for elections, despite his promise to do so. In November 1978, he was overthrown in a bloodless coup in November 1978 by General David Padilla Arancibia, who was supported by the younger institutionalist faction of the military. Arancibia saw the main role of the military as the defense of the country rather than political intervention and announced elections for 1979 without naming an official government candidate. Electoral reforms simplified voter registration, and 90% of the electorate chose among eight presidential candidates in honest elections. 1979 election, Guevara presidency, and Natusch coup When none of the main presidential candidates gained a majority in the general election the following July, and the National Congress of Bolivia was equally unable to elect a president, it appointed former Revolutionary Nationalist Movement head Walter Guevara Arze as interim president for a year, beginning on August 8, 1979. This was first civilian regime since the brief term of Luís Adolfo Siles Salinas in 1969. Guevara was overthrown after a few months, however, by a bloody coup under Colonel Alberto Natusch Busch in November 1979. Natusch himself stepped down after just two weeks because of intense civilian opposition and his limited military support, as well as diplomatic action by the United States to prevent recognition of the Natusch government. Geiler interim presidency, 1980 election, and military juntas Lidia Gueiler Tejada was appointed as a new interim president on November 16, 1979. Gueiler was head of the Chamber of Deputies and a veteran Revolutionary Nationalist Movement politician, and became the first female leader of Bolivia. The following June, Gueiler presided over the 1980 Bolivian general election, the third in three years. The parties of the left gained a clear majority of the vote. Although no presidential candidate secured a majority of the popular vote, former president Hernán Siles Zuazo and his Democratic and Popular Unity (Unidad Democrática y Popular, UDP) coalition alone got 38% of the votes; Siles was thus favoured to win the presidency by congressional ballot on August 6, 1980. The congressional ballot process was disrupted on July 17, 1980 by the violent military coup of General Luis García Meza, cousin of the deposed president Gueiler, who fled the country. Reportedly financed by cocaine traffickers and supported by European mercenaries recruited by Klaus Barbie, former Gestapo chief in Lyon, the coup began the rule of the first Junta of Commanders of the Armed Forces, one of the darkest periods in Bolivian history. Arbitrary arrest by paramilitary units, torture, and disappearances--with the assistance of Argentine advisers--destroyed the opposition. Government involvement in cocaine trafficking resulted in international isolation for Bolivia. Cocaine exports reportedly totaled US$850 million in the 1980–81 period of the García Meza regime, twice the value of official government exports. The \\"coca dollars\\" were used to buy the silence or active support of military officers. But García Meza, who failed to gain support in the military, faced repeated coup attempts and was pressured to resign on August 4, 1981. The ruthlessness, extreme corruption, and international isolation of the García Meza government completely demoralized and discredited the military; many officers wanted to return to democracy. However, the second Junta of Commanders of the Armed forces (led by General Celso Torrelio Villa) was reluctant to call for elections. Vildoso reconvenes the 1980 congress In July 1982, after yet another attempt by the García Meza clique to return to power, a third Junta of Commanders of the Armed Forces appointed General Guido Vildoso Calderón as de facto President, and entrusted him to return the country to democratic rule. Rather than calling a new election, Vildoso decided to reconvene the 1980 Congress and respect the results of that year's presidential contest. When Congress reconvened on September 23, 1982, one of its first acts was to reconfirm the 1980 election results, which showed former president Hernán Siles well ahead, though short of a majority. In October Congress overwhelmingly elected Siles, who assumed the presidency on October 10, 1982. Notes References *Rex A. Hudson and Dennis M. Hanratty. Bolivia: a country study.

Wheat, cotton and vegetables are grown there. Samundri is one of the oldest tehsils of Pakistan. Most families are Arain Gujjar and Jutt people. History The name Samundri comes from the presence of three Hindu temples. The name Seh-Mandri derives from the words seh (three) and mandr (temple). Thus, seh-mandri means a small city with three temples. The name evolved into Samundri. The city has many buildings constructed in the 1930s or before. Until 1904, during British rule, Samundri was headquarters of a tehsil in Jhang district . Samundri Tehsil was transferred to Lyallpur District when the latter was created. At that time, it had an area of .Samundri - Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 22, p. 26 The population in 1906 was 266,277, spread across 495 villages, including Samundri (population, 765), the headquarters. The land revenue and cesses in 1905-6 amounted to 600,000 to 700,000. The tehsil consists of a level plain, sloping gently towards the Ravi and the Deg on the south, and is now irrigated by the Chenab Canal, except for a few scattered plots in the Ravi lowlands which depend on wells. The soil is generally of fine quality. The boundaries of the tehsil were somewhat modified at the time of the formation of the New District. By the 1900s, Western Punjab was predominantly Muslim, supporting the Muslim League and the Pakistan Movement. Migration between India and Pakistan was continuous before the Partition of India. After the Partition of India in August 1947, the Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India Amloh town of Punjab, while Muslims from India settled in Western Punjab and across Pakistan.Dube, I. &. S. (2009). From ancient to modern: Religion, power, and community in India hardcover. Oxford University Press. In 1947, when partition took place, many people from the village Nva Chakk 372 moved to Patiala District, Amloh, India (now Fatehgarh Sahib or Sirhind). It was reduced to in 1994.

Evo Morales has held the presidency since 2006. A new constitution was enacted in 2009. Bolivia's population has roughly doubled over this period, from 5 million in 1980 to 10 million as of 2012. Hernán Siles Zuaso (1982–85) Hernán Siles Zuazo in October 1982 The former president Hernán Siles Zuazo assumed the presidency of Bolivia on 10 October 1982, following a general strike that brought the country close to civil war. Severe social tension, exacerbated by economic mismanagement and weak leadership, forced Siles Zuaso to call early elections and relinquish power a year before the end of his constitutional term.  Víctor Paz Estenssoro (1985–1989) In the 1985 elections, the Nationalist Democratic Action (ADN) of General (and former dictator) Hugo Banzer Suárez won a plurality of the popular vote, followed by former President Víctor Paz Estenssoro's Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR) and former Vice President Jaime Paz Zamora's Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR). But in the second round of voting by congress, the MIR sided with the MNR, and Paz Estenssoro was chosen for a fourth term as President. When Estenssoro took office in 1985, he faced a staggering economic crisis. Economic output and exports had been declining for several years. Hyperinflation had reached an annual rate of 24%. Social unrest, chronic strikes, and unchecked drug trafficking were widespread. In 4 years, Paz Estenssoro's administration achieved economic and social stability. The military stayed out of politics, and all major political parties publicly and institutionally committed themselves to democracy. Human rights violations, which badly tainted some governments earlier in the decade, were no longer a problem. However, Estenssoro's remarkable accomplishments were not won without sacrifice. The collapse of tin prices in October 1985, coming just as the government was moving to reassert its control of the mismanaged state mining enterprise, forced the government to lay off over 20,000 miners. Under pressure from the United States to control coca production, Bolivia passed Law 1008 to enable eradication. Protests by coca growers in Chapare against the proposed law were met by the Villa Tunari massacre in which 12 farmers were killed.  Jaime Paz Zamora (1989-1993) In the 1989 elections, Jaime Paz Zamora agreed to Patriotic Accord coalition between his MIR party and their former enemy, Gen. Hugo Banzer's ADN. Paz Zamora assumed the presidency, and the MIR took half the ministries, while Banzer's party took control of the National Political Council (CONAPOL) and the other ministries. Banzer was promised the presidency if the alliance was successful in the following election. Two days after taking power, the government implemented Supreme Decree 21060 (followed by DS 21660), known as the ‘New Economic Policy’, which included reforms for monetary and fiscal stabilisation, the unification of the exchange rate system, tax reform, trade liberalisation, and freezes on wages. These packages were supported with lines of credit arranged by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Paz Zamora was a moderate, center-left President whose political pragmatism in office outweighed his Marxist origins. Having seen the destructive hyperinflation of the Siles Zuazo administration, he continued the neoliberal economic reforms begun by Paz Estenssoro, codifying some of them. The president took a fairly hard line against domestic terrorism, personally ordering the December 1990 attack on terrorists of the Néstor Paz Zamora Commission, named for his brother. Paz Zamora was less decisive against narcotics trafficking. The government broke up a number of trafficking networks but issued a 1991 surrender decree giving lenient sentences to the biggest narcotics kingpins. Also, his administration was extremely reluctant to pursue coca eradication. It did not agree to an updated extradition treaty with the US, although two traffickers have been extradited to the U.S. since 1992. Beginning in early 1994, the Bolivian Congress investigated Paz Zamora's personal ties to accused major trafficker Isaac Chavarria, who subsequently died in prison while awaiting trial. MIR deputy chief Oscar Eid was jailed in connection with similar ties in 1994; he was found guilty and sentenced to 4 years in prison in November 1996. Technically still under investigation, Paz Zamora became an active presidential candidate in 1996. Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada (1993-1997) upright The 1993 elections continued the tradition of open, honest elections and peaceful democratic transitions of power. An alliance between the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) and the Revolutionary Liberation Movement Tupaq Katari (MRTKL) defeated the Patriotic Accord coalition, and the MNR's Sánchez de Lozada was selected as president. The MRTKL's Víctor Hugo Cárdenas became the first Indigenous person elected vice-president in South America. Sánchez de Lozada pursued an aggressive economic and social reform agenda. The most dramatic change undertaken by the Sanchez de Lozada government was the capitalization program, under which investors acquired 50% ownership and management control of public enterprises, such as the Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) oil corporation, telecommunications system, electric utilities, and others. The reforms and economic restructuring were strongly opposed by certain segments of society, which instigated frequent social disturbances, particularly in La Paz and the Chapare coca-growing region, from 1994 through 1996. The Sánchez de Lozada presidency also twice amended the Bolivian Constitution of 1967, defining Bolivia as a multi-ethnic and multi- cultural nation, and some Indigenous rights were legally recognized.Schilling- Vacaflor, A.

As a result, the ADN's leader, former dictator Hugo Banzer, returned to power at age 71 as a democratically elected leader. Between January and April 2000, a series of anti-privatization protests took place in Cochabamba against the privatization of the municipal water supply that was being pushed through on the recommendation of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The Bolivian government declared martial law, killing several people, arresting protest leaders and shutting down radio stations. After continued disturbances and civic pressure, the government finally rolled back the privatization on April 10, 2000. Afer a lung cancer diagnosis, Banzer resigned in August 2001, and was succeeded by his vice-president Jorge Quiroga.  MNR Presidencies (2002-2005)  In the 2002 elections, Sánchez de Lozada ran again, and narrowly beat NFR's Manfred Reyes Villa and the indigenous leader Evo Morales of the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party. Several days before Bolivians went to the voting booths, the U.S. ambassador Manuel Rocha warned the Bolivian electorate that if they voted for a candidate known to have links with drug-trafficking, referring indirectly to Morales, the US would cut off foreign aid and close its markets to the country. Because of the public outrage this statement generated, Morales received nearly 21% of the vote, putting him only a couple points behind Sánchez de Lozada.Jeremy D. Rosner and Mark Feierstein, \\"Hindering Reform In Latin America\\", The Washington Post, August 6, 2002 During this period, a divisive conflict known as the Bolivian Gas War began as a dispute over the exploitation of Bolivia's large natural gas reserves in the south of the country. Strikes and blockades first erupted in September 2003, with several deaths and dozens of injuries in confrontations with the armed forces. President Sánchez de Lozada resigned under pressure from protesters, formally handing over the presidency to his vice-president, Carlos Mesa, in order to preserve the Constitutional order. Mesa was inaugurated and promised to address the demands of the protesting majority. In the face of mounting protests, he resigned on March 7, 2005, claiming he was unable to continue governing the country. With promises of support, he withdrew his resignation. In May–June 2005, Mesa again tendered his resignation and in a hastily convened session of the Parliament in Sucre. Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the President of the Supreme Court, became president on the night of June 9, 2005. Political agreements were reached to modify the Constitution, and allow the full renewal of Parliament, simultaneously with a new presidential election in December. Evo Morales (2006-2019) The deterioration of the Bolivian political system contributed towards the rise of a loose confederation of indigenous social movements, the MAS and other parties, with the head of the MAS Evo Morales, a former cocalero, as leader. In the elections of December 2005 Evo Morales and MAS obtained a comfortable victory reaching 54% of the electorate's votes, becoming the first Native Bolivian president in history. left In March 2006 Morales announced the increase of the minimum wage by 50%. However, six Bolivian workers in every ten are part of the informal economy, thus limiting the extent of such a legally mandated increase in wages. On May 1, 2006, Evo Morales nationalized most of Bolivia's natural gas fields, which many indigenous Bolivians had demanded for years. Troops were sent in to occupy the gas fields and take back control from foreign companies that day.BIF Bulletin No 2 Many fields were operated by Petrobras, Brazil's largest energy company, and this political development was expected to strain relations between Morales and leftist Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. On October 29, 2006 the Morales government signed agreements with eight foreign gas firms including Petrobras, to give the Bolivian national gas company a majority stake in the gas fields, bringing the nationalization to completion. On May 4, 2008 autonomy referendums were held in four eastern departments, in which they declared themselves autonomous from the central government. All four referendums passed.BIF Bulletin Special Edition May 2008 Evo Morales deemed this referendum illegal. Turnout was at 70%.Bolivia's referendum sees low turnout In February 2009 a new constitution was enacted by Evo Morales. This gave Bolivians of indigenous descent more economic and political rights.

Geography of the German Democratic Republic, VEB Hermann Haack, Gotha, p. 7 ff. . ( or Thüringisches Schiefergebirge, literally \\"Thuringian Slate Hills\\") is a low range of mountains in the German state of Thuringia.  Geography  The Thuringian Highland borders on the Thuringian Forest to the southwest. It is plateau about 20 km wide that slopes southeast towards the Saale valley in the area of the Saale Dam and includes parts of the Thuringian Forest and Thuringian Highland and Upper Saale Nature Park. The largest towns in the Thuringian Highland are Saalfeld and Bad Blankenburg which lie on its northern perimeter, Neuhaus am Rennweg in the highest region and Bad Lobenstein on the eastern edge (where it transitions into Franconian Forest). The area includes a total of 4 smaller regions: * upper Saale valley * Plothen Lake District * High slate mountains * Sormitz-Schwarza region The slate mountains of the Vogtland and Thuringian Highland stretch from the Thuringian Forest to the Ore Mountains (Erzgebirge). They are between about 300 m to high, and comprise gently rolling hills which are part of the backbone of the Central Uplands. They extend for about 75 km from east to west and 50 km from north to south. Typical features of the landscape are the dolerite peaks or Kuppen (like the Pöhlde or the Hübel) with their wooded crests. These are made from a volcanic rock, dolerite, which is harder than the surrounding rocks and so weathers more slowly, giving rise to the characteristic Kuppen.  Geology  The Steinerne Rose, a diabase rock formation near Saalburg-Ebersdorf As its German name suggests, the Thuringian Highland is mainly made of slate rock. Although this region was formed in a similar way to the Harz, it lacks the sharp divisions caused by fault lines. Almost all the way round the region transitions gradually into the surrounding land. The rocks found here are from the Palaeozoic era, i.e. the Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian and Lower Carboniferous periods. The most important ones are: * Shale, * Alaunschiefer, * Radiolarite, * Limestone, * Sandstone, * Greywacke, * Dolerite, * Spilite * and volcanic conglomerates. Karst-forming, and hence cave-forming, limestone only occurs in a few, small, isolated areas. As a result the number of caves is very low.  Rivers and hydro-electric power  In the Saale Valley there are two of the largest dams in Germany, which form the Hohenwarte and Bleiloch Reservoirs. In the Schwarza Valley there is the Goldisthal Pumped Storage Station, opened in 2003, which is one of the largest pumped-storage hydro-electric power stations in Europe.  Mountains and hills  Around the steep-sided valleys of the Schwarza and Saale the height difference between hilltops and valley bottoms is often as much as 300 m or more, which is large for hills of this size. # Großer Farmdenkopf (869 m), Sonneberg district # Kieferle (867 m), Sonneberg district # Bleßberg (865 m), Hildburghausen district # Dürre Fichte (861 m), Sonneberg district # Breitenberg (Thuringian Forest) (844 m), Sonneberg district # Fellberg (842 m), Steinach, Sonneberg district # Eselsberg (842 m), Hildburghausen district, Thuringian Forest/Thuringian Highland border # Pechleite (839 m), Hildburghausen district # Fehrenberg (835 m), Hildburghausen district, Thuringian Forest/Thuringian Highland border # Hoher Schuß (827 m), Saalfeld-Rudolstadt district # Wurzelberg (820 m), Sonneberg district # Jagdschirm (813 m), Saalfeld-Rudolstadt district # Hintere Haube (811 m), Ilm district # Langer Berg (809 m), Ilm district # Hettstädt (808 m), Saalfeld-Rudolstadt district # Rauhhügel (802 m), Saalfeld-Rudolstadt district # Roter Berg (799 m), Sonneberg district # Wetzstein (791 m), Saalfeld- Rudolstadt district # Meuselbacher Kuppe (786 m), Saalfeld-Rudolstadt district # Fröbelturm (784 m), Saalfeld-Rudolstadt district # Grendel (784 m), Hildburghausen district # Spitzer Berg (781 m), Saalfeld-Rudolstadt district # Simmersberg (781 m), Landkr.

This distribution is parameterized by two parameters p\\\\in(0,1) and \\\\beta >0.  Introduction  The study of lengths of the lives of organisms, devices, materials, etc., is of major importance in the biological and engineering sciences. In general, the lifetime of a device is expected to exhibit decreasing failure rate (DFR) when its behavior over time is characterized by 'work-hardening' (in engineering terms) or 'immunity' (in biological terms). The exponential-logarithmic model, together with its various properties, are studied by Tahmasbi and Rezaei (2008).Tahmasbi, R., Rezaei, S., (2008), \\"A two-parameter lifetime distribution with decreasing failure rate\\", Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, 52 (8), 3889-3901. This model is obtained under the concept of population heterogeneity (through the process of compounding).  Properties of the distribution   Distribution  The probability density function (pdf) of the EL distribution is given by Tahmasbi and Rezaei (2008) : f(x; p, \\\\beta) := \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{-\\\\ln p}\\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\beta(1-p)e^{-\\\\beta x}}{1-(1-p)e^{-\\\\beta x}} where p\\\\in (0,1) and \\\\beta >0. This function is strictly decreasing in x and tends to zero as x\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty. The EL distribution has its modal value of the density at x=0, given by :\\\\frac{\\\\beta (1-p)}{-p \\\\ln p} The EL reduces to the exponential distribution with rate parameter \\\\beta, as p\\\\rightarrow 1. The cumulative distribution function is given by :F(x;p,\\\\beta)=1-\\\\frac{\\\\ln(1-(1-p) e^{-\\\\beta x})}{\\\\ln p}, and hence, the median is given by :x_\\\\text{median}=\\\\frac{\\\\ln(1+\\\\sqrt{p})}{\\\\beta}.  Moments  The moment generating function of X can be determined from the pdf by direct integration and is given by : M_X(t) = E(e^{tX}) = -\\\\frac{\\\\beta(1-p)}{\\\\ln p (\\\\beta-t)} F_{2,1}\\\\left(\\\\left[1,\\\\frac{\\\\beta-t}{\\\\beta}\\\\right],\\\\left[\\\\frac{2\\\\beta-t}{\\\\beta}\\\\right],1-p\\\\right), where F_{2,1} is a hypergeometric function. This function is also known as Barnes's extended hypergeometric function. The definition of F_{N,D}({n,d},z) is : F_{N,D}(n,d,z):=\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{ z^k \\\\prod_{i=1}^p\\\\Gamma(n_i+k)\\\\Gamma^{-1}(n_i)}{\\\\Gamma(k+1)\\\\prod_{i=1}^q\\\\Gamma(d_i+k)\\\\Gamma^{-1}(d_i)} where n=[n_1, n_2,\\\\dots , n_N] and {d}=[d_1, d_2, \\\\dots , d_D]. The moments of X can be derived from M_X(t). For r\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}, the raw moments are given by :E(X^r;p,\\\\beta)=-r!\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{Li}_{r+1}(1-p) }{\\\\beta^r\\\\ln p}, where \\\\operatorname{Li}_a(z) is the polylogarithm function which is defined as follows:Lewin, L. (1981) Polylogarithms and Associated Functions, North Holland, Amsterdam. :\\\\operatorname{Li}_a(z) =\\\\sum_{k=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{z^k}{k^a}. Hence the mean and variance of the EL distribution are given, respectively, by :E(X)=-\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{Li}_2(1-p)}{\\\\beta\\\\ln p}, :\\\\operatorname{Var}(X)=-\\\\frac{2 \\\\operatorname{Li}_3(1-p)}{\\\\beta^2\\\\ln p}-\\\\left(\\\\frac{ \\\\operatorname{Li}_2(1-p)}{\\\\beta\\\\ln p}\\\\right)^2.  The survival, hazard and mean residual life functions  Hazard function The survival function (also known as the reliability function) and hazard function (also known as the failure rate function) of the EL distribution are given, respectively, by : s(x)=\\\\frac{\\\\ln(1-(1-p)e^{-\\\\beta x})}{\\\\ln p}, : h(x)=\\\\frac{-\\\\beta(1-p)e^{-\\\\beta x}}{(1-(1-p)e^{-\\\\beta x})\\\\ln(1-(1-p)e^{-\\\\beta x})}. The mean residual lifetime of the EL distribution is given by : m(x_0;p,\\\\beta)=E(X-x_0|X\\\\geq x_0;\\\\beta,p)=-\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{Li}_2(1-(1-p)e^{-\\\\beta x_0})}{\\\\beta \\\\ln(1-(1-p)e^{-\\\\beta x_0})} where \\\\operatorname{Li}_2 is the dilogarithm function  Random number generation  Let U be a random variate from the standard uniform distribution. Then the following transformation of U has the EL distribution with parameters p and β: : X = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta}\\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{1-p}{1-p^U}\\\\right).  Estimation of the parameters  To estimate the parameters, the EM algorithm is used. This method is discussed by Tahmasbi and Rezaei (2008). The EM iteration is given by : \\\\beta^{(h+1)} = n \\\\left( \\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\frac{x_i}{1-(1-p^{(h)})e^{-\\\\beta^{(h)}x_i}} \\\\right)^{-1}, : p^{(h+1)}=\\\\frac{-n(1-p^{(h+1)})} { \\\\ln( p^{(h+1)}) \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\\\\\{1-(1-p^{(h)})e^{-\\\\beta^{(h)} x_i}\\\\\\\\}^{-1}}. Related distributions The EL distribution has been generalized to form the Weibull-logarithmic distribution.Ciumara, Roxana; Preda, Vasile (2009) \\"The Weibull-logarithmic distribution in lifetime analysis and its properties\\". In: L. Sakalauskas, C. Skiadas and E. K. Zavadskas (Eds.) Applied Stochastic Models and Data Analysis , The XIII International Conference, Selected papers. Vilnius, 2009 If X is defined to be the random variable which is the minimum of N independent realisations from an exponential distribution with rate parameter β, and if N is a realisation from a logarithmic distribution (where the parameter p in the usual parameterisation is replaced by ), then X has the exponential- logarithmic distribution in the parameterisation used above.

As the United States constitution does not permit the Executive Branch to unilaterally implement treaties without the consent of the senate, many maintain that IGAs lack a basis in the US constitution. IGAs were not described or envisioned in the FATCA legislation, but were conceived and implemented after the fact when it became clear that FATCA would fail without them.

Rugby career Evans spent his entire rugby career with unfashionable Monmouthsire club Blaina, turning down several approaches by professional rugby league clubs to 'go North'.Jenkins (1991), pg 55. He had an immense loyalty to his home club and spent his entire life in the village where he was born. In 1904 Evans received his one and only international call-up, becoming the first player to be directly capped from Blaina RFC. Evans was brought into the Wales team to face England in the opening game of the 1904 Home Nations Championship, captained by Cardiff's Gwyn Nicholls. Evans was only one of two news caps in the Welsh squad for the encounter, the other being David John Thomas from Swansea; both men coming into the pack. The game ended in a draw, after a late try from Teddy Morgan was disallowed to prevent a Welsh victory.Griffiths (1987), pg 4:11. The Welsh selectors responded by bringing in five new caps for the next match, and Evans was one of those replaced. After leaving his playing career behind, Evans became a committee man for Blaina. His family also had strong connections to the club, with his brother Alf captaining the team for two seasons, and his son Bill playing for Blaina before switching to first class team Newport.

The thickly wooded Weser ridge is one of the northern outliers of the German Central Uplands on the southern edge of the North German Plain and forms part of the TERRA.vita Nature Park in the west and Weser Uplands Schaumburg-Hameln Nature Park in the east. The Weser Hills are widely known because of Schaumburg Castle which stands on the Nesselberg (c. ) in the Schaumburg district of the town of Rinteln, and is the emblem of Schaumburg Land.  Geography  The Weser Hills cross the counties of Minden-Lübbecke, Schaumburg and Hameln-Pyrmont in a roughly east–west direction, from the town of Porta Westfalica and the Westphalian Gap in the west past Rinteln to Hessisch Oldendorf in the east, where they transition seamlessly to the Süntel, a ridge of similar height running from northwest to southeast. They form part of the perimeter of the Weser Uplands and thus also the German Central Uplands which lie south of the North German Plain. North of the Weser Hills there are only a few hills of the Calenberg Uplands, such as the nearby ridges of Harrl and Bückeberge. To the west, on the other side of the Porta Westfalica, the chain continues as the Wiehen Hills, geologically of similar formation, reaching Bramsche (northwest of Osnabrück). South of the Weser Hills, and roughly parallel to them, flows the River Weser, from Hessisch-Oldendorf in the east, through Rinteln, towards Vlotho in the west, before turning northeast to the town of Porta Westfalica. These northern areas around the Upper Weser Valley, south of the hills are an old area of settlement, which was protected by Schaumburg Castle on the hill of Nesselberg. From the water gap at Porta Westfalica - the Westphalian Gap - the river swings north in order to reach the southern part of the North German Plain. North of the hills are the upper reaches of the Aue (also called the Bückeburger Aue) that run roughly east to west.  Hills  The Wesergebirge is a chain of about two dozen hills that are arranged one after another in a ridge and which reach a height of at the Möncheberg in the east. In its centre section, west of the A 2 motorway, they reach a maximum height of 278 m at the Wülpker Egge and a height of 235.2 m at the westernmost hill of the Weser chain, the Jakobsberg, which is located east of Porta Westfalica and on which the Jakobsberg transmission tower stands.

(Photo by Pierre GUNTZ) Emma Guntz (née Emma Linnebach) (born August 30, 1937 in Bruchsal) is a German-French poet, journalist and editor living and working in Strasbourg, France. Life After passing her Abitur exam in her home town of Bruchsal, Emma Guntz studied English, Latin and history at the Ruprecht-Karls-University Heidelberg. Soon after graduation she married Antoine Guntz, a Strasbourg physician; they have three children. In the 1970s she worked as a radio journalist, communicating German culture and tradition to Alsatians. From 1984 to 1996 she hosted a weekly broadcast on poetry at Radio France 3 Alsace, in which she presented contemporary poetry in French, German and the Alsatian dialect. The first collection of her own poetry, In Klarschrift (In Plain Writing), was published in 1996, followed by others, the last one (in 2009) being Späte Widmung (Late Dedication).

Her recent work \\"MAdamEva\\" (2015) is in prose and presents a special version of Genesis, mainly from Eve’s point of view. Literary critic Gabriele Weingartner attests that Guntz has found \\"poetic words full of imagination and precise in style.\\" .\\" review by Gabriele Weingartner in Literaturblatt für Baden-Württemberg No 2, 2016, full text online here. As a writing journalist she contributed feuilleton articles, e.g. for the German-language edition of Dernières Nouvelles d'Alsace, as well as apostils and short stories. In 2000 she was awarded the Johann Peter Hebel Award, of Baden-Württemberg, and in 2001 she was the first woman to be honored by Deidesheim in Rhineland-Palatinate as Turmschreiberin (tower scribe), which meant sporadic sojourns in the medieval castle tower and resulted in the publication of another collection of poems Ein Jahr Leben (One year of Life), partly dedicated to Deidesheim. Apart from her literary and journalistic work Emma Guntz was instrumental in co- organizing the ten conferences of the literarische Biennale Mitteleuropa (a biannual meeting of central European literature) at Strasbourg-Schiltigheim (1989–2008). From 1986 to 2001 she was chair person of an organization for the social reintegration of young and permanently unemployed persons.

Background Harvey studied for his O Levels and A Levels at Hough Side High School in Bramley. After leaving school, he took up a job at the Guardian Royal Exchange Insurance Company. He then took up an administration job at Farsley Celtic F.C. which led to a chance meeting with Geoffrey Richmond, the then chairman of Scarborough. In February 1992, Harvey took up at job at Scarborough after having been personally invited by Richmond to the club. When Richmond became chairman of Bradford City, Harvey followed him where he eventually became Managing Director and the club rose to the Premier League for the first time in its history.

As Chief Executive, he took responsibility for the day to day administration and management of the largest single body of professional clubs in European football which includes the fourth most watched league competition, the EFL Championship, as well as League One and Two, the EFL Cup and the EFL Trophy. During his time at the EFL, Shaun Harvey has implemented a number of controversial changes to the League and its competitions. In the summer of 2016, The Football League was renamed the ‘English Football League’ as part of a comprehensive corporate and competition re-branding to give the League’s competitions a new and distinct identity, while simultaneously retaining its unique heritage. More recent changes included a controversial change in format to the Football League Trophy. He claimed this was to allow a young players a chance to develop, to reinvigorate the competition and to increase prize moneyhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37544161.

History and overview The development of a suburb southeast of Córdoba proper by developer Miguel Crisol was accompanied by a flurry of public investment. Among the first of such works was the Boys' Middle School, commissioned by Governor José Vicente de Olmos in 1906 and built by the Ministry of Public Works of the Province of Córdoba. Designed by Elías Senestrari, the renaissance revivalist building was inaugurated on November 4, 1909. Governor Olmos, who had recently died, was honored by having the school named after him.Skyscraper page forum: Patio Omos The promenade Set on the northeast corner of the intersection of three major avenues, the semi-circular school was designed to maximize classroom area, and its original capacity of 500 students was later expanded to 800. The building's condition declined over the decades, however, and a 1977 earthquake in San Juan, Argentina, though over 300 mi (480 km) to the west, caused it serious structural damage and led to its closure. It remained abandoned until a 1991 initiative by Governor Eduardo Angeloz resulted in the building's restoration. The agreement signed in 1992 between the Province of Córdoba, the building's proprietors and a consortium of two local developers allowed the firms a 35-year lease at a token monthly rent in exchange for their development of the former school into an upscale shopping gallery and other investments. The resulting Patio Olmos Shopping Center was inaugurated in May 1995.Prensa Red: Patio Olmos el negociado continuado Mounting controversy surrounding the non-payment of taxes, delays on the promised construction of an annex for the adjoining Libertador Theatre (Córdoba's premier opera house), and the consortium's connections to the board of directors at the failed Banco Mayo S.A. led to political fallout, however, and the Province sold Patio Olmos in 2006 to IRSA, the nation's leading real estate development firm. The quick sale allowed Córdoba to rescind its contentious lease contract, though the building's sale price of US$32.5 million was reportedly well below market value. Patio Olmos remains Córdoba's most important shopping mall, with brands like Lacoste, Puma, La Martina, Carmen Steffens, Levi's, 47 Street, Adidas, Swarovski, among others. Its 25,000 m² (265,000 ft²) indoor area houses over 150 retail outlets and a multiplex cinema operated by the Sydney-based Hoyts Group.

Overview In 2009, USTDA approved funding of $750,000 for a feasibility study grant to assist the Union économique et monétaire ouest-africaine (UEMOA), in determining the technical and economic viability of developing a rail line from Bamako, Mali to Mali's southeastern border with Côte d’Ivoire, as well as its associated costs, design and construction criteria, and implementation plan. The study will also include a technical assessment on the existing rail line between Dakar, Senegal and Bamako, which would be linked to the proposed rail line. The total cost of the proposed line is expected to exceed $1.9 billion. The 15-month railway study USTDA contract was authorized to begin in October 2010. ZETA-TECH Associates of Cherry Hill NJ (NOW Harsco Rail Intelligent Solutions) undertook the study with other companies assisting, including the Law Offices of Peter C. Hansen, LLC, which analyzed the existing legal framework and drafted a treaty to modernize the ownership structure and facilitate long-term financing of the revitalized railway. A final report was delivered in December 2012, and a French translated copy was accepted by UEMOA in March 2013.  Timeline   2011  * On 31 November 2011, an agreement was signed to build a new international railway connecting Côte d'Ivoire, Burkino Faso, Niger and Benin.http://www.railwaysafrica.com/blog/2012/01/railway-to-link-west-african- states/ No progress reported on that announcement as of the summer of 2012 In October 2012 UEMOA held a meeting to at its Burkina Faso headquarters to review and discuss the initial draft final report of the USTDA funded rail project. The consulting team presented four different capital cost modernization plans. One would be for just minimum safety changes. The most forward would support a possible 10 million ton modernized standard gauge conversion rail project—with the earliest train operations occurring sometime around 2017 between Dakar and Bamako. The requirements would include an integrated plan execution with mine + rail + port + a new Railway 2-nation Authority—if the project consultant suggestions are followed. Building just the railway without integrating these other transport and customer commercial actions was recommended as a critical process for moving towards a final total plan. The Bamako to the south railway corridor has a separate set of competitive issues and technical costs associated with it. No public policy decision for either of the two railway corridors is likely until sometime in 2013 given the complexity of the choices and critical action items in order to move forward. The consultant team also projected the possible Pro Forma Income Statement for three of the possible railway operating company levels of modernization. Contact UEMOA or the consultants for further information as to the capital costs, possible operating scenarios, and economic outcomes. A complete Critical Path for debating and then making project decisions (given the many technical choices) and then executing project funding and bidding and construction was also submitted to UEMOA by the consultant team. As of mid October 2012 that process was just starting at a technical review level under the guidance of UEMOA staff. A PowerPoint presentation that summarized the technical results and possible financial or Pro Forma operating income of the upgraded Dakar to Bamako railway was presented to The Corporate Council of Africa in Washington in mid-February 2013. Among the items discussed was the calculated cost of 1) a modern meter gauge railway service as requested by a UEMOA rail task force \\"solution\\" and 2) the cost of a conversion to a standard gauge between Dakar and Bamako. The project capital costs together with the estimated cost of rail operation plus the cost of repaying the capital infrastructure debt were identified in a Pro Forma Income Statement for the improved railway enterprise (a designed railway company) at a given future year 2017 tonnage. The project design was built around an attempt to resolve for the lowest possible bulk cargo rates to reach a new proposed bulk cargo port south of Dakar. The target rate was <$32 a metric ton at standard gauge and somewhat higher at meter gauge. This pro forma analysis shows evidence that the railway can be independently financed by investors without the need of a Senegal or a Mali mine company actual railway \\"ownership\\" (a burden to the mine company Balance Sheet). A railway authority is recommended as a means of attracting private capital using the bonding and commercial structure of such a government of Senegal and Mali chartered body rather than a conventional concession approach. The railway feasibility was based on a variety of engineering and economic possible designs that used different rail mode market shares and different levels of railway operating efficiency (operating ratios) and different track structure safety standards. Naturally, the local African leaders will have to make the final design choices. From an economic point of view, subsidies and doners are not necessary if the traffic market share and the engineering and train operational designs are correctly matched. USTDA financed The next step is for the large shippers to meet collectively or individually with UEMOA and test the feasibility study against their specific (and often private) shipper requirements. Either the authors or UEMOA should be contacted. In the meantime, rail service is continuing in the corridor under the existing concession arrangement. During February 2013 the report was translated into French. Contact UEMOA or Harsco Rail Zeta Tech or USTDA for further information.

A pupil of Antonio Banfi, with whom he graduated in philosophy in 1933, he taught aesthetics at the Faculty of Humanities and Philosophy at the University of Bologna from 1952 to 1981. His interest in literature and the arts was always accompanied by that for the modern anti-dogmatic philosophy: after the publication of his graduation thesis \\"Autonomy and Heteronomy of art\\" published by Sansoni in 1936, his research on anti-idealistic literary figures and models found voice in comments published in Orpheus from 1932 and in Corrente di vita giovanile in 1938-1939, self promoted magazines. Sensitive to new cultural trends, he was in favor of Hermeticism and Neo avant garde, working at the same time as theorist and militant reviewer: he published the Saggi di poetica e poesia. Con una scheda sulla Swedenborg (1942) and edited the anthologies of Lirici nuovi (1943) and Lirica del Novecento (Lyrics for the 20th Century) (1953). He was the author of the article \\"Ermetismo\\" (Hermeticism) in the Enciclopedia del Novecento (Encyclopedia of the 20th Century) (1977). Focusing on cultural models forgotten by Neo-idealism, he devoted himself to the themes of the Baroque period, publishing in 1953 Del Barocco e altre prove and in 1960 Barocco e Novecento. Con alcune prospettive metodologiche (The Baroque and the 20th Century: With Methodological Perspectives). He never gave up his study of philosophy: in 1955 he wrote I presupposti storici e teorici dell’estetica kantiana (The Historical and Theoretical Presuppositions of the Kantian Esthetic), from 1965 D. Hume e i presupposti empirici dell’estetica kantiana (D. Hume and the Empirical Presuppositions of the Kantian Esthetic), from 1967 Burke e l’estetica dell’empirismo inglese (Burke and the Esthetics of English Empiricism) and from 1972 Da Bacone a Kant. Saggi di estetica (From Bacon to Kant: Essays in Esthetics). In particular in Progetto di una sistematica dell’arte (Project for a Systematics of Art)(1962) he outlined a theory of aesthetic understanding of art forms such as phenomenology. He based all later research on the principles of critical phenomenology. In 1956 he founded the magazine Il Verri, of which he was the editor, while also directing from 1973 for Paravia the series La tradizione del nuovo; within the university he directed the journal Studi di estetica (Studies in Esthetics), which synthesized the results of philosophical inquiry which he conducted along with his students. In the publications from the 1960s, the central themes were poetics: Poetiche del Novecento in Italia (Italian Poetics of the 20th Century), 1961, Le poetiche del Barocco, (Poetics of the Baroque), 1963 and of literary institutions: Le istituzioni della poesia (The Institutions of Poetry), 1968, Da Ungaretti a D’Annunzio (From Ungaretti to D'Annunzio), 1976, Che cosa è la poesia? (What Is Poetry?), 1986. Among the more recent writings are Il Chaos, il metodo. Primi lineamenti di una nuova estetica fenomenologica, (Chaos and Method: The Early Lineaments of a New Phenomenological Esthetic), 1981 and Gli specchi della poesia. Riflessione, poesia, critica (Mirrors of Poetry: Reflections, Poetry, Criticism), 1989. President of the Bologna Board of artistic manifestations, of the Accademia delle Scienze and of the Accademia Clementina di Bologna, associated and correspondent of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei of Roma, he donated his library (almost 30,000 works) and his personal archive (another 18,000 letters and thousands of autographs) to the Municipality of Bologna; at present they are preserved at the Biblioteca Comunale dell’Archiginnasio.

Located in the middle of Wilsonville's town center, the park cost $4.5 million to complete. The park includes the Oregon Korean War Memorial, a visitor's center, paths, a play area, picnic tables, and an amphitheater among other features. Completed in 2005, Town Center Park is also home to Wilsonville's first interactive water feature. History Capital Realty donated the land for a park in the center of the Wilsonville town center development in 1994 on condition that it be used as a park. In September 1996, the city started to get more input from city residents on the plans for what was then to be a $2 million park. Early plans for the park included a war memorial for the Korean War, a clock tower, a pond, a fountain, landscaping, picnic areas, a basketball court, a play area for children, gardens, paths, an amphitheater, lawns, and a pavilion area to be partially covered and used to host events such as street fairs. Parking was also to be built, which included spaces for recreational vehicles. By October 1996, the estimated cost to build the park had increased to $3.3 million. All funding for the park had been secured at that time, and was to come from Wilsonville and the county's lodging taxes and from a $1 million grant by the county's tourism council to be used to build a visitor's center. Wilsonville's parks board approved of the plans that included the war memorial, the visitor's center, gardens, paths, fountains, the amphitheater, and lawns at that time. The visitor's center would also provide restrooms for the park, offer meeting space for the community, and be the home of the city's chamber of commerce. In November 1996, Oregon voters passed Ballot Measure 47, which lowered property tax rates and imposed restrictions on raising those rates. Due to the passage of the measure, the city delayed the project because of concerns about the impact of the measure on funding for building and maintaining the park. The estimated cost to build Town Center Park at that time was $3.3 million. Plans for building the park later moved forward, and construction of the regional visitor's center began in June 1998. The building opened at Town Center Park in April 1999 at a cost of $1.5 million. Water feature in foreground, Korean War Memorial in background Construction on the war memorial started with a groundbreaking ceremony on May 4, 2000. In September 2000, the memorial was opened in the park to pay tribute to those soldiers from Oregon who died in the Korean War. During the summer months in 2000 and 2001 the park hosted a small farmer's market run by the chamber of commerce. Also in 2000, the park began hosting the annual Wilsonville Celebration Days. The park was completed in the Spring of 2005 when the final phase of construction finished after adding several features, including an interactive water play area, the first in the city. The water feature had been delayed due to a water shortage in the city before the completion of a new water treatment plant. This last phase cost around $1.2 million and was paid for through funds generated by an urban renewal district and built by Hoffman Construction. Total costs for building the park came to $4.5 million. The fountain had to be closed due to water quality issues in June 2007, but re-opened a few days later. In October 2008, free Wi-Fi service was added to the park by the chamber of commerce. Amenities Located within the park are several structures and a variety of features. These include the Korean War Memorial and a visitor information center. The visitor's center at the park was paid for by Clackamas County's Tourism Development Council and is operated by the Wilsonville Chamber of Commerce. A brick, wood, and glass structure, it is located at the southwest corner of the park and was constructed by First Cascade Corporation. The building also includes the park's public restrooms. The park was designed by Murase Associates, headed by landscape architect Robert Murase. Features at the park include a water feature for people to play in, an amphitheater with stage, a picnic shelter, picnic tables, children's play equipment, paths, and a half-sized basketball court. The water feature is a zero-depth interactive element that has water cascade down a series of concrete channels to a small pond that contains bubblers. There is also the Rotary Rose Garden operated by the local Rotary Club and trees dedicated to the city's sister city relationship. Events Water feature in the park Town Center Park is used to stage many community events in Wilsonville. In May or June, Town Center Park is the site of the Wilsonville Festival of the Arts featuring local and regional artists in a variety of disciplines from pottery to photography. The festival began in 2000. During parts of July and into August the park is host to the Wilsonville Rotary Summer Concerts on Thursday nights, a free concert series. In August, the park plays host to the annual Fun in the Park Festival that includes concerts, children's exhibits, crafts, and food and wares vendors. The one-day event is part of Wilsonville Celebration Days and replaced Boone's Ferry Days in the year 2000, and draws in excess of 6,000 people to the park.

Launched in 1981, it was used for weather forecasting in the United States. Launch of GOES-E on a Delta 3914 GOES-5 was built by Hughes Space and Communications, and was based on the HS-371 satellite bus. At launch it had a mass of , with an expected operational lifespan of around seven years. GOES-E was launched using a Delta 3914 carrier rocket flying from Launch Complex 17A at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The launch occurred at 22:29 GMT on 22 May 1981. The launch successfully placed GOES-E into a geostationary transfer orbit, from which it raised itself to geostationary orbit on 2 June by means of an onboard Star 27 apogee motor. Following insertion into geostationary orbit, GOES-5 was briefly placed at a longitude 85° West, however by the end of 1981, it had been moved to 75° West. It remained there until 1987, when it was moved to 106° West. In 1988 it was relocated to 65° West, where it operated until 1989. The primary instrument carried aboard GOES-5, the Visible Infrared Spin-Scan Radiometer or VISSR, failed in 1984. The GOES-1 and GOES-4 satellites were reactivated to fill the gap in coverage until a replacement could be launched. It was finally replaced by the ground spare, GOES-H, in 1987 after its intended replacement, GOES-G, failed to reach orbit. GOES-5 was retired to a graveyard orbit on 18 July 1990.

Later in the year Supercoach finals was created Point Scoring Points are gained or deducted depending on the performances of your 22 players for each round. Up to four emergencies can replace players in your starting 22, who didn't play that specific round. If you have a 0 scoring player in a certain position and don't have an emergency selected in that position, you'll not score any points for that player. You can choose who on the reserves list you'll use as an emergency. Meanwhile, the remaining five substitutes on your reserves list don't score, but can increase in value. Points are based on Champion Data's official ranking points. Unlike Dream Team, Supercoach scoring relies heavily on disposal efficiency and contested possessions, probably the biggest difference in the two games' scoring.

Kilcummin, a headland to the west of Killala Bay, preserves the remains of a religious site, with a church of early date and a graveyard.MacNeill, The Festival of Lughnasa, p. 611 History Cuimín's background is touched upon in a genealogical text compiled by Dubhaltach Mac Fhir Bhisigh (died 1671), who was a member of a learned family from the area around Killala Bay.Ó Riain, Dictionary of Irish saints, p. 245 It names the saint \\"Cumain Foda\\" and identifies him as a descendant of Conaing son of Fergus son of Amailgaid, thereby linking him to the leading dynasty in the area,O'Donovan, The Genealogies, Tribes and Customs of Hy-Fiachrach, pp. 8-9 the Uí Amolngada.Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, pp. 47-48. Máire MacNeill suggests that he is probably distinct from another Connacht saint of the same name, Cumméne Fota, who was abbot of Clonfert in the 7th century, although \\"the coincidence of name and epithet is curious\\". Pádraig Ó Riain also treats him as a different saint. Dubhaltach also distinguished him from Cuimín mac Dioma (of Uí Suanaig), whose descendants are said to rest at Kilcummin.O'Donovan, The Genealogies, Tribes and Customs of Hy-Fiachrach, pp. 44-45 Cuimín of Kilcummin, Holy Well While information about Cuimín's life and medieval cult is lacking, there is relatively plentiful evidence for his veneration in early modern and modern times. A holy well at Kilcummin was believed to have healing powers and served as a central place for the patron held in his honour on the last Sunday of July. The day was known as Domhnach Chrom Dubh (in Irish) or Garland Sunday (in English). Curative powers were also ascribed to earth coming from the saint's grave. The prerogative of administering it to visitors belonged to the Machan (Maughan) or Loughney family, presumably because the family was known to descend from the erenachs (wardens) of the church. A flagstone at the saint's grave known as Leac Cuimín (The stone of Cuimín) is thought to have been used as a 'cursing stone' under similar guidance: members of the Machan (Maughan) or Loughney Lavin, History and legends of the Civil Parish of Kilcummin, p. 20 family could be asked to perform a ceremony to call down maledictions on people who had caused harm to others.\\"Excursions\\", 295-298 The practice came to an end in the first half of the 19th century, when a dean by the name of Lyon had it removed \\"for certain weighty reasons\\" and built into the wall of the cathedral at Ballina, County Mayo. Modern folklore tells that Crom Dubh was the cow which revealed the presence of the saintly child by licking a boat on the shore. The child was found inside and he was brought up by a couple named Maughan and Loughney, the owners of the cow.

It is primarily practiced in northern Malaysia and southern Thailand. The art is also known as silat tua (old silat) because tradition credits it as the oldest form of silat Melayu. It is sometimes called silat tua Yawi, being the Thai-Malay pronunciation of Jawi in this case referring to the Thai Malay community. These two latter names are increasingly popular among Malaysian practitioners, so as not to acknowledge the Pattani origin of the art. History The founder of Silat Pattani is referred to as pendeta guru from the Sanskrit terms pandit and guru. The exact age of the art is unknown but it is believed to date back to the Hindu-Buddhist era. It incorporates four elemental forms like Chinese xingyiquan and several forms based on the Indian Ramayana, indicating influence from both countries. One origin story tells of three brothers getting lost in the forest. One brother named Yuso took refuge in a tree to be safe from tigers. While in the tree, he watched an elder tiger teach its young how to move as a predator and avoid capture. Yuso recounted the movements to his brothers and together they created a new fighting system. Basic concepts Jantan Betina Jantan betina literally means \\"male-female\\" and is the Malay concept of opposites. It also refers to the concept of relativity wherein hard is only harder than something that is softer but is softer than something that is harder. Jantan is represented by hard, fierce, fast actions while betina is slow, subtle and soft. The two opposing forces are dynamic – never in perfect balance but constantly changing from one into the other by leading or following, forcing or flowing. In silat practice, this means that one force must be met with its opposite. A strong attack may be defended with a soft, evasive response but heavy and powerful actions might be useful against a yielding, subtler opponent. For this reason, fighters must be able to instantly change from strong to gentle. Jantan and betina must also complement each other so that, for example, when the dominant hand is high the other is low or when one palm faces up the other faces down, etc. Panchabuta According to Malay metaphysical theory, which borrows heavily from Vedic Hindu concepts, the universe is composed of five elements (panchabuta): fire, earth, water, wind and the intangible fifth element of angkasa (space or ether). The body is a miniature of the cosmos with each element corresponding to one of the body's functions. Water is blood and the bodily fluids; fire is the senses of sight and hearing; earth is the flesh, muscle and bone while wind is the respiratory system. Training the four elements is believed to bring practitioners into alignment with the cosmos. This begins by focusing on one or all of the elements in turn during meditation. Hand position varies depending on the element but all are done either in the half lotus or preferably the full lotus position. Element meditation is followed by a string of freestyle techniques reflecting the four elements, performed either seated or while standing. Each element can be explored in infinite manifestations. For example, wind might be a gentle breeze or a tornado. However, the elements tend to be identified with certain qualities. Fire techniques are fast with sudden twists and changes of height. Wind involves jumping movements and acrobatic leaps. Earth is expressed through solid stances and strong attacks. Soft and fluid moves represent water. Forms Unlike most styles of silat, Silat Pattani is more similar to Indian gatka in that it has no pre-arranged forms but instead relies on freestyle sets. Forms which are performed solo are called tari while those done with a partner are called silat pulut. Such training allows for the learning of various techniques and applications without having to teach set moves. Ramayana forms Having been founded by ascetics, silat is closely tied to Hindu-Buddhist philosophy and legend. As with other Southeast Asian martial arts, Silat Pattani contains sets based on characters from the Ramayana (Malay:Hikayat Seri Rama, Thai:Ramakien). Called Tari Ramayana, these forms require the practitioner to not only mimic the characters' movements but their mannerisms as well. Three figures are of particular importance in Silat Pattani. Seri Rama: Imitates Rama shooting an arrow, searching for it and then retrieving it. This set is characterised by a straight back and confident movements in imitation of Rama's regal bearing. It is often recommended for improving the posture of students who are prone to hunching too much. Sita Dewi: Mimics Sita's coyness and femininity. The specialty of this form is a technique where the thumb touches the first two fingers which can be used to block and parry as well as attack. Movements are short and economical, allowing for easy retreat. Attacks are aimed at the vital points. Sita's style is epitomised by the kerambit, a claw-like knife that Malay women would wear in their hair. Hanuman: The monkey king Hanuman is famous for his strength. This set is unpredictable and combines agile leaping escapes with attacks that are both hard and fast. Hanuman's weapon is the gedak (mace). Animal forms One teaching states that a silat Pattani practitioner should have the agility of a deer, the strength of a tiger and the mystic abilities of a dragon. Before starting this training, practitioners assume the proper frame of mind by performing movements that embody the respective animal. Silat Pattani contains six animal sets which can be done empty-handed or with weapons. Some animals are emulated in more than one form. {align=\\"center\\" border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" |+Animal forms of Silat Pattani !style=\\"background-color:#CCCCCC; width:119px;\\"English !!style=\\"background- color:#CCCCCC; width:65px;\\"Kelantan Malay !!style=\\"background- color:#CCCCCC\\"- !Deer |align=centerRuso |The most basic animal form.

The stick, machete, sarong, spear and kris are the five basic weapons. Unlike later silat styles which favour the kris as their main weapon, it is regarded as the least useful weapon in silat Pattani and is therefore taught last. *Kayu/ Bate (stick) *Pare (machete/broadsword) *Chindai/ Samping (sarong) *Tombok/ Lembing (spear) *Keris (dagger) *Kerambit (tiger-claw knife) *Gedak (mace) See also *Silat Melayu *Tomoi *Bando *Bokator *Silambam *Wuxingquan *Xingyiquan References * Category:Silat Category:Thai martial arts ","title":"Silat Pattani"},{"id":"23991070","text":"Uttara KalamritaKalidasa, Uttara Kalamrita. Ranjan Publications(India, 1994) is a reference work on Vedic astrology or Jyotisa. It is also termed as sidereal astrology, written by Kalidasa. However, it is unknown whether the Kalidasa who wrote this work is the same Kalidasa who wrote Raghuvamsha and Abhijñānaśākuntalam. The manuscript is available in various libraries in India, including the Government Oriental Manuscript Library in Chennai. History The text was first printed in the Telugu script. The reference to Andhra Bhasha, Urdu or Persian, Turushka, Sukkani, Rahu Kala, and other things show that he came after the sixteenth century. His use of the words Udyoga, got job, mud-cleaning, Smarta, Nadi and Vinadi, Sarasa-sallapa (a peculiar Telugu expression), Tyajya Kala and others prove that he is South Indian. His opposition to the marriage with the daughter of the maternal uncle references to the usages in the South in the states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. These and other factors convince us that the author belongs to a time after the 16th or the 17th century. There is a Shankara Vijaya attributed to Madhava Vidyaranya, but the next clearly states that the author was condensing the work of Vyasachala (17th century) and that he was called Abhinava Kalidasa.

Sarah Palin, former Republican Governor of Alaska, coined the term when she charged that proposed legislation would create a \\"death panel\\" of bureaucrats who would decide whether Americans—such as her elderly parents, or children with Down syndrome—were \\"worthy of medical care\\". Palin's claim has been referred to as the \\"death panel myth\\", as nothing in any proposed legislation would have led to individuals being judged to see if they were worthy of health care. Palin's spokesperson pointed to Section 1233 of bill HR 3200 which would have paid physicians for providing voluntary counseling to Medicare patients about living wills, advance directives, and end-of-life care options. Palin's claim was reported as false and criticized by the press, fact-checkers, academics, physicians, Democrats, and some Republicans. Some prominent Republicans backed Palin's statement. One poll showed that after it spread, about 85% of respondents were familiar with the charge and of those who were familiar with it, about 30% thought it was true. Owing to public concern, the provision to pay physicians for providing voluntary counseling was removed from the Senate bill and was not included in the law that was enacted, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In a 2011 statement, the American Society of Clinical Oncology bemoaned the politicization of the issue and said that the proposal should be revisited. For 2009, \\"death panel\\" was named as PolitiFact's \\"Lie of the Year\\", one of FactCheck's \\"whoppers\\", and the most outrageous new term by the American Dialect Society. Background Betsy McCaughey On July 16, 2009, former lieutenant governor of New York, Betsy McCaughey, a longtime opponent of federal healthcare legislation said Section 1233 of HR 3200 was \\"a vicious assault on elderly people\\" because it would \\"absolutely require\\" Medicare patients to have counseling sessions every five years that would \\"tell them how to end their life sooner\\". Conservative talk radio hosts including Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham repeated McCaughey's claim. The AARP, a non-profit lobby group for retired persons, responded that the sessions were in no way designed to encourage euthanasia, but would instead help seniors make better decisions and would help ensure that their wishes were followed. PolitiFact said the proposal provided Medicare coverage for optional counseling sessions for patients who wanted to learn more about end-of-life-planning. On July 24, 2009, an op-ed by McCaughey was published in the New York Post. In the piece, which was titled \\"Deadly Doctors\\", McCaughey falsely asserted that presidential advisor Ezekiel Emanuel believed the disabled should not be entitled to medical care, and quoted him out of context. On July 27, excerpts from the McCaughey's op-ed were read, with approval, by Representative (Rep.) Michele Bachmann (R-MN) on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. Within days, Rep. John Boehner (R-OH), then the Minority Leader of the House and Rep. Thaddeus McCotter (R-MI), the Republican Policy Committee Chairman, repeated claims that Section 1233 would encourage \\"government-sponsored\\" euthanasia, and Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC) charged that the proposal would \\"put seniors in a position of being put to death by their government.\\" On July 30, former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich, declared that the House bill had \\"a bias toward euthanasia\\". The Washington Post reported on August 1, 2009 that the claim had been spreading via \\"religious e-mail lists\\" and internet blogs. In early August, members of Congress held town hall meetings that were marked by hostility—including shouting, sporadic, physical altercations and comparisons between the proposed reforms and Nazi Germany. Palin's initial statement Sarah Palin, who had been keeping a low profile after her July 3, 2009, resignation announcement as Alaska's Governor, was the first to use the \\"death panel\\" term on August 7, 2009. In her first Facebook note, she said: Although Palin's post did not identify a portion of legislation she believed mandated \\"death panels\\", a spokesperson pointed to HR 3200, Section 1233, and Palin herself followed up in an August 12 Facebook note clarifying her argument by discussing Section 1233. However, neither Section 1233 nor any other provision in any health care bill provided for a system to determine if individuals were worthy of health care. Yet, Palin's charge of \\"death panels\\" became believed by about 30% of those surveyed in the U.S. within a week. Proposed policy Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) sponsored the bill HR 3200. Legislation providing for counseling patients on advance directives, living wills and end-of-life care had been on the books for years, however, the laws did not provide for physicians to be reimbursed for giving such counseling during routine physical exams of the elderly. The Patient Self-Determination Act (1991) requires health care providers, including hospitals, hospices and nursing homes to provide information about advance directives to admitted patients. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act began providing reimbursements for end-of-life care discussions with terminally ill patients in 2003. A bill to provide for reimbursement every five years for office visit discussions with Medicare patients on advance directives, living wills, and other end of life care issues was proposed by Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) in April 2009—with Republican cosponsors Charles Boustany (R-LA), a cardiovascular surgeon, Patrick Tiberi (R-OH), and Geoff Davis (R-KY). The counseling was to be voluntary and could be reimbursed more often if a grave illness occurred. The legislation had been encouraged by Gundersen Lutheran and a loose coalition of other hospitals in La Crosse, Wisconsin that had had positive experiences with the widespread use of advance directives. Blumenauer's standalone bill was tabled and inserted into the large health care reform bill, HR 3200 as Section 1233 shortly afterward. Supporters of the Section 1233 counseling provision included the American Medical Association (AMA), AARP, the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, and Consumers Union; the National Right to Life Committee opposed \\"the provision as written.\\" It was removed from the Senate version of the bill due to the death panel controversy and was not included in the reconciled and final bill which became law in March 2010 and which is known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In late December 2010, it was reported that a new Medicare regulation had been approved that would pay for end-of-life care consultations during annual physical exams. The regulation was to be effective January 1, 2011, but was deleted on January 4 for political reasons. Reaction town hall meeting The \\"death panel\\" myth produced widespread reaction among the media, physicians and politicians. Media The Economist said the phrase was used as an \\"outrageous allegation\\" to confront politicians at town hall meetings during the August 2009 congressional recess. The New York Times said the term became a standard slogan among many conservatives opposed to the Obama administration's health care overhaul. Former Newsweek editor Jon Meacham said it was \\"a lie crafted to foment opposition to the president's push for reform\\" and Fox News analyst Juan Williams said \\"of course there is no such thing as any death panel.\\" The Christian Science Monitor reported that some Republicans used the term as a \\"jumping-off point\\" to discuss government rationing of health care services, while some liberal groups applied the term to private health insurance companies. Journalist Paul Waldman of The American Prospect called the \\"death panel\\" charge a consequential policy lie, a falsehood about a policy that had definite effects on the policy, a type of lie that is not as condemned in the media as personal lies. The Daily Telegraph noted that some critics of the U.S. reform used the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)—\\"as an example of [doing] the sort of drug rationing that amounted to a 'death panel'\\". NICE, as one of its functions, uses cost-effectiveness analysis to determine whether new treatments and drugs should be available to those covered by Britain's National Health Service. The Sunday Times wrote that Sarah Palin's use of the \\"death panels\\" term was a reference to NICE. Physicians C. Porter Storey Jr. said the term represents fear that due to financial pressure \\"some mechanical, governmental method will be used to determine how much of our scarce health care resources will be applied to their situation.\\" Atul Gawande, a surgeon and writer, said that fear of missing out on an expensive life-extending treatment is behind the phrase, but he thought that framing the issue in this way was completely mistaken. \\"[T]he trouble is not whether we're going to offer a $100,000 drug to help someone get 3 or 4 months\\"; our big trouble is that patients receive a $100,000 drug that not only yields no benefit—it also causes major side effects that shortens their lives\\", he said. Gawande said doctor's schedules of 20 minute appointments, a lack of payments and the emotional difficulty of conversations about mortality were barriers to the doctor-patient discussions about end-of-life care issues, which can take about an hour. Geriatric psychiatrist Paul Kettl said his experience in a geriatric unit showed end-of- life discussions and reimbursements were \\"desperately needed\\" as these hour- long conversations are \\"ignored in the crush of medication and disease management.\\" In the Journal of the American Medical Association, Kettl wrote he was in favor of the \\"death panels that were originally proposed ... periodic discussions about advance directives that Medicare would pay for as medical visits.\\" Kettl noted that the attention-catching phrase \\"death panels\\" became \\"a lightning rod for objections to a series of ideas about health care besides\\" end-of-life discussions, and that somehow, \\"the concept of physicians being paid for time to talk with patients and their families about advance directives ... generated into the fear of decisions about life and death being controlled by the government.\\" Kettl also wrote that, \\"We can expect more good medical ideas to be destroyed by sound bites and needless concerns that will be exaggerated. It makes for good television, but bad medicine.\\" The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published a statement in January 2011 advocating an individualized approach to treatment and supportive care for patients with advanced cancer. They stated that there is: Benjamin W. Corn, a cancer specialist, wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine that the \\"death panels\\" controversy showed Americans were uneasy discussing topics related to the dying process. Corn said the end-of-life care conversations can have an important positive effect on patients, although some patients may not ever welcome them. Corn also said that certain issues, such as whether experimental therapies should be reimbursed, the possible expansion of hospices, restoring dignity to the process of dying, and guidelines for physician assisted suicide, need to be addressed directly. David Kibbe, a physician, and Brian Klepper, a health care analyst and consultant, wrote, \\"One of American politics' most disingenuous conceits is that health care must cost what we currently pay. Another is that the only way to make it cost less is to deny care. It has been in industry executives' financial interests to perpetuate these myths\\".Brian Klepper and David Kibbe (August 1, 2011). Rethinking The Value Of Medical Services Health Affairs. Accessed August 24, 2011. Politicians Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) stated that \\"death panels\\" were a baseless charge that unnecessarily incited fear and detracted from real problems in the proposed legislation. She said the proposed legislation was \\"bad enough that we don't need to be making things up.\\" Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA), thought there was illogical confusion over \\"death panels\\"; he said advance directives put \\"authority in the individual rather than the government.\\" In July 2010 Rep. Bob Inglis, (R-SC) said that he thought it was counterproductive for the conservative movement for some to promote misinformation about death panels when they do not exist. Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) endorsed Rep. Charles Boustany's statement that \\"medical panels of people who care about what's best for their patients ... is good science and good medicine.\\" Speaking for himself, Issa said \\"Republicans have to step back from the words 'death panels'.\\" Michael F. Cannon, a former domestic policy analyst for the U.S. Senate Republican Policy Committee and a member of the Cato Institute, wrote that \\"[p]aying doctors to help seniors sort out their preferences for end-of-life care is consumer-directed rationing, not bureaucratic rationing.\\" President Barack Obama cited the charge—along with the citizenship conspiracy theories and \\"job-killing\\" allegations—as demagogy against him. In testimony before the United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, Erskine Bowles (D), co-chair of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, called \\"death panels\\" \\"a kind of crazy stuff\\" and added that end-of-life care in the U.S. needed reform. Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) called the references to \\"death panels\\" or euthanasia \\"mind-numbing\\" and \\"a terrible falsehood\\". He thought that the news media contributed to the persistence of the myth by amplifying misinformation and extreme behavior. When a regulation for reimbursing consultation payments was upcoming, Blumenauer cautioned supporters to keep things quiet, reasoning that Republican leaders would attempt to continue the myth. Palin response On August 12, 2009, Palin said \\"the elderly and ailing would be coerced into accepting minimal end-of-life care to reduce health care costs\\" and charged on Twitter that Britain's National Health Service (NHS) was an evil \\"death panel\\", leading to so many replies from British citizens defending the NHS that Twitter crashed. Stephen Hawking, who suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), responded by saying \\"I wouldn't be alive today if it weren't for the NHS.\\" In a September 2009 speech, Palin said the term was \\"intended to sound a warning about the rationing that is sure to follow if big government tries to simultaneously increase health care coverage while also claiming to decrease costs.\\" In November 2009 Palin said that Obama was \\"incorrect\\" and \\"disingenuous\\" when he called the \\"death panel\\" charge \\"a lie, plain and simple.\\" In the National Review she said > [t]o me, while reading that Section of the bill, it became so evident that > there would be a panel of bureaucrats who would decide on levels of health > care, decide on those who are worthy or not worthy of receiving some > government-controlled coverage ... Since health care would have to be > rationed if it were promised to everyone, it would therefore lead to harm > for many individuals not able to receive the government care. That leads, of > course, to death. She explained that the term should not be taken literally, likening it to when President Ronald Reagan called the Soviet Union the \\"Evil Empire.\\" \\"He got his point across. He got people thinking and researching what he was talking about. It was quite effective. Same thing with the 'death panels'. Media Matters stated that Palin's claim of \\"death panels\\" was \\"simply false, regardless of whether she meant it literally or figuratively.\\"Eric Schroeck Taranto Offers Up Weak Defense Of Palin's \\"Death Panel\\" Lie Media Matters February 3, 2011. In December 2009 Palin warned on Twitter that a merged health care bill could have the \\"death panels\\" restored. In October 2010, Palin defended her use of the term in a Newsmax.com interview. Palin said she > ... spoke a lot about the rationing of care that was going to be a part of > Obamacare, and, you know, I was about laughed out of town for bringing to > light what I call death panels, because there's going to be faceless > bureaucrats who will—based on cost analysis and some subjective idea on > somebody's level of productivity in life—somebody is going to call the shots > as to whether your loved one will be able to receive health care or not. To > me, death panel. I called it like I saw it, and people didn't like it. Palin used the term jokingly while speaking at the 2009 Gridiron Club dinner for journalists, saying it was like being in front of a \\"death panel\\". Newt Gingrich Supporters After Palin's statement, conservative commentators including Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh and Michelle Malkin agreed that death panels were mandated by the proposed legislation. On August 9, former House speaker Newt Gingrich backed Palin's \\"death panel\\" charge by saying that the bill created numerous agencies and panels, that government was not to be trusted, and \\"there clearly are people in America who believe in establishing euthanasia, including selective standards\\". One week later, Gingrich wrote that the proposed legislation did not provide for government rationing of health care, but it was \\"all but certain to lead to rationing.\\" At an August 12, 2009 town hall meeting, Senator Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Health Care subcommittee said, \\"living wills ... ought to be done within the family. We should not have a government program that determines you're going to pull the plug on Grandma.\\" Grassley later said that he did not think the provision would grant the government the authority to decide who lives and dies. Impact Political Consultation payments were removed from the Senate version of the bill by the Senate Finance Committee. TIME wrote that \\"a single phrase—'death panels'—nearly derailed health care reform\\". The Washington Post wrote that \\"President Obama's health-care initiative was nearly consumed by the furor\\" over the end-of-life care provision that would allow physician reimbursement for counseling. By mid-August 2009, about a week after Palin's initial Facebook note, the Pew Research Center reported that 86% of Americans had heard of the \\"death panels\\" charge. Out of those who had heard the charge, 30% of people thought it was true while 20% did not know. For Republicans, 47% thought it was true while 23% did not know. Oberlander said the false warnings of a \\"government takeover\\" and \\"death panels\\" from Republicans drowned out the \\"Democrats' focus group–tested mantra of 'quality, affordable health care' \\". Morone said the White House was not able to offer a \\"persuasive narrative to counter the Tea Party percussion\\", and \\"struggled to recapture public attention\\", contributing to Republican Scott Brown's election. The election of Brown in the special Senate election in Massachusetts was a surprise victory for Republicans and a setback for the chance of health care reform under Democratic leadership; Brown won the historical Senate seat of the late Democrat Ted Kennedy, ending the Democrat's supermajority of 60 in the Senate. In September 2010, six months after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, a BBC article stated that among the \\"sticky charges\\" that had stuck against the bill was the false charge of \\"government 'death panels' deciding who can get what sort of care\\". A survey by the Regence Foundation and National Journal released in 2011 showed 40% of Americans knew that the \\"death panels\\" were not in the Affordable Care Act, while 23% said they thought the law allowed government to make end-of-life care decisions on behalf of seniors, and 36% said they did not know. Other findings from the survey included: * 78% thought palliative care and end-of- life issues should be in the public discourse; * 93% thought those decisions should be a top priority in the U.S. health care system; * 70% agreed with the idea that \\"It is more important to enhance the quality of life for seriously ill patients, even if it means a shorter life\\" while 23% placed more importance on extending life through any possible medical treatment; * Doctors, family, and friends were highly trusted sources for end-of-life care information while only 33% trusted elected officials or political candidates for accurate information. Social Atul Gawande, a physician who writes on health care topics for The New Yorker, said \\"that the whole death panel reduction and reaction to it\\" temporarily \\"shut down our ability to even have a national discussion about how to have the right [end-of-life] conversation\\" between doctors and patients. When investigating for his article \\"Letting Go\\", Gawande was asked to refrain from writing about palliative care by physicians who were concerned the article might be manipulated to create another political controversy—and as a result, hurt their profession. Professor Harold Pollack wrote that given the \\"anxieties captured in the crystalline phrase 'death panel,' I would not commence a national cost-control discussion within the frightening and divisive arena of end-of-life care.\\" Bishop et al. were fearful of how their publication on CPR/DNR would be received by the medical and bioethics communities. They were concerned because in \\"the era of rhetoric centered on fictional 'death panels' \\" their paper addressed \\"the quest for immortality implicit in US culture, a culture of 'life-at-all costs' that medical technology has advanced\\". Bishop et al. interpreted cautioning comments from their peers as a suggestion \\"that land mines of 'death panels' await us\\". Media analysis PolitiFact gave Palin's claim its lowest rating—\\"Pants on Fire!\\"—on August 10 and on December 19 it was named \\"Lie of the Year\\" for 2009. \\"Death panel\\" was named the most outrageous term of 2009 by the American Dialect Society. The definition was given as \\"A supposed committee of doctors and/or bureaucrats who would decide which patients were allowed to receive treatment, ostensibly leaving the rest to die\\". FactCheck called it one of the \\"whoppers\\" of 2009. Megan Garber of the Columbia Journalism Review called the topic \\"irresistible\\" to reporters because it covered conflict, drama, innuendo, and Sarah Palin. Garber said it was \\"notoriously challenging for the press to deal with\\" because the old method of delegitimization, ignoring, was no longer workable. \\"Debunking rumors without simultaneously sanctioning them has always been a fraught endeavor, with the proliferation of niche media sites over the past several years only rendering that effort even more precarious,\\" said Garber. A study by Regina G. Lawrence, a communications professor, and Matthew L. Schafer, a Juris Doctor candidate, found that \\"the mainstream news, particularly newspapers, debunked 'death panels' early, fairly often\\", however, some journalists presented information in a he said/she said style, often confusing readers, and most did not include an explanation as to why the charge was false. Lawrence and Schafer said that \\"the dilemma for reporters playing by the rules of procedural objectivity is that repeating a claim reinforces a sense of its validity—or at least, enshrines its place as an important topic of public debate. Moreover, there is no clear evidence that journalism can correct misinformation once it has been widely publicized. Indeed, it didn't seem to correct the death panels misinformation in our study.\\" In his study of the \\"death panel\\" myth, Brendan Nyhan concluded that \\"once such beliefs take hold, few good options exist to counter them\\". However, in future such cases he recommended that \\"concerned scholars, citizens, and journalists ... [could] create negative publicity for the elites who are promoting misinformation\\", and \\"pressure the media to stop providing coverage to serial dissemblers.\\" In contrast to the above statements suggesting there is no good method to correct misinformation in the minds of the public, MIT professor Adam Berinsky has found some success when people are exposed to corrective information from sources that belong to the same political party as the misinformer.Adam Berinsky (June 14, 2011). Rumors, truths, and reality: A study of political misinformation (draft version) Academic analysis Bioethicist George Annas wrote that America has a \\"death denying culture that cannot accept death as anything but defeat.\\" We will \\"prepare for any and every disease and screen for every possible 'risk factor', but we are utterly unable to prepare for death.\\" Annas commended and quoted Boston Globe columnist Ellen Goodman, who wrote \\"I think that what our [healthcare] system may need is not more intervention, but more conversation, especially on the delicate subject of dying ... More expensive care is not always better care. Doing everything can be the wrong thing.\\" However, Annas said mythical \\"death panels\\" blocked exploring these issues, appearing to affirm Ivan Illich's 1975 Medical Nemesis, when he said \\" '[s]ocially approved death happens when man [sic] has become useless not only as a producer but also as a consumer. It is at this point that [the patient] ... must be written off as a total loss'.\\" Brent J. Pawlecki, a corporate medical director, said the phrases \\"death panels\\" and \\"killing Grandma\\" were \\"used to fuel the flames of fear and opposition\\". Gail Wilensky, a health adviser to President George H.W. Bush and John McCain who has overseen Medicare and Medicaid, said the charge was untrue and upsetting, adding that \\"[t]here are serious questions that are associated with policy aspects of the health care reform bills that we're seeing ... And there's frustration because so much of the discussion is around issues like the death panels and Ezekiel Emanuel that I think are red herrings at best.\\" Susan Dentzer, editor of Health Affairs, said Congress' approval of $1.1 billion for comparative effectiveness research in the 2009 stimulus contributed to fear the research would \\"lead to government rationing\\" which \\"fueled the 'death panels' fury of summer 2009.\\" Brendan Nyhan, a health care policy analyst and assistant professor at Dartmouth College, wrote that \\"Obama's plan might lead to more restrictive rationing than already occurs under the current health care system\\", but criticized Palin's statements as largely \\"unjustified and false\\". Nyhan also said that labeling institutions \\"death panels\\" for denying \\"coverage at a system level for specific treatments or drugs\\" was an attempt to \\"move the goalposts of the debate.\\" Princeton economics professor Uwe Reinhardt said that it is possible to slightly bend the U.S. health care cost curve down through a lower volume of health care services \\"by more widespread use of living wills—an idea once actively promoted by Newt Gingrich. But those ideas were met in the past year by dark allusions to 'rationing', to Nazi-style death panels and to 'killing Granny'.\\" Reinhardt said lowering health care costs would require lowering health care incomes, and that such reforms always end up being a political third rail. Health economist James C. Robinson said the debate over \\"death panels\\" showed how willing the public was \\"to believe the worst about perceived governmental interference with individual choices.\\" Historian Jill Lepore characterized \\"death panels\\" as a conspiracy theory that is believed by a minority of the U.S. population and is based on fears that the federal government is conspiring to kill off its weakest members. Of the reform effort, Lepore said it was an \\"unwelcome reminder of a dreaded truth: death comes to us all\\"; of the uproar, Lepore said it was a savvy political tactic in that it rallied a party base against death. Lepore also said Obama was \\"catastrophically outmaneuvered\\" by the spread of the death panel rumors. Johnathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy, said the Obama administration was \\"seemingly unprepared for the intense opposition and fury that erupted during town-hall meetings in the summer of 2009.\\" Political scientist James Morone said the term death panel played a role in the Democrats' loss of control over the public debate because they did not address the \\"underlying fears of big government\\". Morone called the \\"death panel\\" arguments \\"pungent, memorable, simple, and effective.\\" Use after August 2009 In response to legislation in Arizona which cut Medicaid funding for previously approved transplants, E.J. Montini of The Arizona Republic used the term, as did Keith Olbermann of MSNBC. Montini referred to Republican Governor Jan Brewer as \\"Governor Grim Reaper\\" and both Brewer and the Republican-controlled legislature as a \\"death panel\\".Yes, Gov. Brewer, Arizona does have a death panel Arizona Republic December 9, 2010 An editorial by USA Today said, \\"to the extent that death panels of a sort do exist, they're composed of state officials who must decide whether each state's version of Medicaid will cover certain expensive, potentially life-saving treatments.\\" Palin expanded her \\"death panel\\" attack to target the precursor of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), a potential cost-cutting mechanism for Medicare, in September 2009.Sarah Palin Obama and the Bureaucratization of Health Care Wall Street Journal Sept. 8, 2009 After the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform released its recommendation to strengthen the IPAB, which had passed as part of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), she later charged that the board was \\" 'death panel'-like\\".Palin, Sarah, Why I Support the Ryan Roadmap, Wall Street Journal, December 10, 2010. FactCheck found her characterization of the board wrong on three counts. Representative Phil Roe (Republican-Tennessee), who has twice sponsored bills to eliminate the IPAB, said he would associate the term with the IPAB. Roe was described by The Washington Post as \\"a kindred soul by the medical industry\\" in part for his legislative efforts against the IPAB and a \\"magnet during the last election for more than $90,000 in contributions from medical professionals from across the country\\".R.

In March 2010, Democratic Rep. Barney Frank (MA) was quoted as saying \\"There are going to be death panels enacted by the Congress this year, but they're death panels for large financial institutions\\" and later in the same year he used the term in reference to authority under the Dodd–Frank Bill. Later that month, after the Affordable Care Act as amended by the Senate passed the House, conservative commentator David Frum made a widely-read post to his blog criticizing Republicans for their steadfast opposition to the bill over the previous year and a half. There had been congressional Republicans willing to work with Democrats, he said, but they had refrained from doing so out of fear of political reprisals from the Tea Party and other elements of the conservative base that had been regularly encouraged by talk radio and Fox News to believe the worst of the bill. \\"How do you negotiate with somebody who wants to murder your grandmother? Or—more exactly—with somebody whom your voters have been persuaded to believe wants to murder their grandmother?\\" he asked, alluding to the alleged death panels. In November 2010, Paul Krugman said he was deliberately provocative on This Week, calling for \\"death panels and sales taxes\\" to fix the budget deficit. Krugman clarified that \\"health care costs will have to be controlled, which will surely require having Medicare and Medicaid decide what they're willing to pay for—not really death panels, of course, but consideration of medical effectiveness and, at some point, how much we're willing to spend for extreme care.\\" In his 2011 book, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee wrote that the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness from the 2009 stimulus were the seeds from which \\"the poisonous tree of death panels will grow.\\" Media Matters called this a \\"lie\\"; it reported that Huckabee mischaracterized the council and that it was eliminated in the 2010 health care reform.Mike Huckabee's Latest Lie: \\"Death Panels\\" Media Matters March 9, 2011.

Paul Van de Water of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said \\"Huckabee seems to be suggesting that we shouldn't do research to find out what medical procedures work best just because that research could conceivably be misused. The new law makes every effort to assure that won't happen.\\" Critics of the United Kingdom’s handling of certain medical cases, such as the cases of Charlie Gard (2017) and Alfie Evans (2018), have used the term “death panel” to describe those who made the decision to pull life support. In 2018 Democratic socialist New York congressional candidate (later U. S. Representative) Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on Twitter \\"Actually, we have for-profit 'death panels' now: they are companies + boards saying you’re on your own bc they won’t cover a critical procedure or medicine, Maybe if the GOP stopped hiding behind this 'socialist' rock they love to throw, they’d actually engage on-issue for once.\\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1069268454455341056?s=20 During the COVID-19 pandemic, the podcast Chapo Trap House often referred to the lack of hospital space in countries heavily afflicted by the crisis as having Death Panels.

Released for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux on 8 December 2005, the game is the second video game title in the Samorost series and the sequel to Samorost. Plot The game starts when Aliens land at Gnome's house and steal his berries. They are interrupted by Gnome's dog who is then kidnapped by Aliens. Gnome spots aliens leaving with his dog and sets up to save it. He lands with his Polokonzerva airship on alien's planet. He manages to infiltrate alien's underground base and finds the dog who is held by alien's leader for joy. Gnome saves the dog and togethe they escape the planet but their airship crashes on another planet. They venture through the planet and eventually find taxi driver and convince him to take them home. Driver then sits with Gnome and dig at a bonfire before departing while Gnome lies at Cherry trees falling asleep. Gameplay Gameplay is similar to the previous game. The player interacts with the world with a simple point and click interface directing a small, white-clad humanoid with a little cap and brown boots (called simply \\"gnome\\" by Dvorsky). The goal of the Samorost games is to solve a series of puzzles and brain teasers. The puzzles are sequentially linked forming an adventure story. The game contains no inventory or dialogue, and the solving of puzzles mainly consists of clicking on-screen elements in the correct order. Solving a puzzle will immediately transport the player character to the next screen. The game features surrealistic, organic scenarios that mix natural and technological concepts (often featuring manipulated photographs of small objects made to look very large), creative character designs and a unique musical atmosphere. Development Jakub Dvorský, creator of Samorost. Together with his freelance Flash and web design agency, Amanita Design, Dvorský produced a sequel, Samorost 2. In Samorost 2, the gnome goes on a longer quest to save his kidnapped dog and return safely home. The first chapter of this game (comprising the first 4 levels) can be played online for free. The second chapter (with 3 levels) is only playable in the full version, which cost $6.90 until the price was later lowered to $5.00.

Formed in Scotland, members of No. 11 (Scottish) Commando adopted the Tam o'shanter as their official headdress.Moreman 2006, p. 45. No. 11 (Scottish) Commando was sent to the Mediterranean as 'C' Battalion Layforce. It took part in operations in Syria and then garrison duties in Cyprus. Its final raid was Operation Flipper the attempt to capture the German commander Erwin Rommel. After the failure of this raid the commando was disbanded. Background The commandos were formed in 1940, by the order of Winston Churchill the British Prime Minister. He called for specially trained troops that would \\"develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast\\".Chappell, p.5 At first they were a small force of volunteers who carried out small raids against enemy occupied territory, Chappell, p.3 but by 1943 their role had changed into lightly equipped assault Infantry which specialised in spearheading amphibious landings.Moreman, p.8 The man initially selected as the overall commander of the force was Admiral Sir Roger Keyes himself a veteran of the landings at Gallipoli and the Zeebrugge raid in the First World War.Chappell, p.6 Keyes resigned in October 1941 and was replaced by Admiral Louis Mountbatten. By the autumn of 1940 more than 2,000 men had volunteered for commando training, and what became known as the Special Service Brigade was formed into 12 units called commandos.Haskew, p.48 Each commando would number around 450 men commanded by a lieutenant colonel. They were sub divided into troops of 75 men and further divided into 15-man sections. Commandos were all volunteers seconded from other British Army regiments and retained their own cap badges and remained on their regimental roll for pay.Moreman, p.12 All volunteers went through the six-week intensive commando course at Achnacarry. The course in the Scottish Highlands concentrated on fitness, speed marches, weapons training, map reading, climbing, small boat operations and demolitions both by day and by night.van der Bijl, p.12 By 1943 the commandos had moved away from small raiding operations and had been formed into brigades of assault infantry to spearhead future Allied landing operations. Three units were left un-brigaded to carry out smaller-scale raids.Moreman, pp.84–85 History Formed in June 1940 from volunteers from Scottish regiments under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Richard Pedder; in February 1941, it became part of Layforce and adopted the designation of 'C' Battalion.Chappell 1996, p. 46.Saunders 1959, p. 52. Deploying to the Middle East, they were sent to Cyprus to garrison the island before being sent to Syria, where they participated in Operation Exporter.Saunders 1959, p. 57. After suffering heavy casualties in the Battle of the Litani River, fighting against the Vichy French, to secure a crossing over the Litani River, the unit returned to Cyprus before it was disbanded along with the rest of Layforce.Saunders 1959, pp. 58–60. Afterwards many of its men were transferred to Middle East Commando, where they formed No. 3 Troop under Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Keyes.Chappell 1996, p. 17. In November 1941, these men carried out a raid on Beda Littoria, in Libya as part of Operation Flipper, with the purpose of capturing Erwin Rommel in his headquarters. The raid was a failure, Keyes was killed in a fire fight at Sidi Rafa and only a handful of the men managed to escape to British lines. For his part in the raid, Keyes received the Victoria Cross posthumously.Chappell 1996, p. 18.

Launched in 1983, it was used for weather forecasting in the United States. GOES-6 was built by Hughes Space and Communications, and was based on the HS-371 satellite bus. At launch it had a mass of , with an expected operational lifespan of around seven years. Launch GOES-F was launched using a Delta 3914 carrier rocket flying from Launch Complex 17A at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The launch occurred at 22:26 GMT on 28 April 1983. Orbit The launch successfully placed GOES-F into a geosynchronous transfer orbit, from which it raised itself to geostationary orbit by means of an onboard Star 27 apogee motor, with insertion occurring on 9 May 1983. Following insertion into geosynchronous orbit, GOES-6 was positioned at 135° West. In 1984 it was moved, initially to 97° West, and later to 108° West to cover for the failure of the Visible Infrared Spin-Scan Radiometer on GOES-5. After GOES-7 replaced GOES-5 in 1987, GOES-6 was returned to 135° West, where it remained for the rest of its operational life. Its imager had failed on 21 January 1989, leaving GOES-7 as the only operational GOES satellite for over five years, until the launch of GOES-8 in 1994. Following this failure, it remained operational as a relay satellite until it was retired to a graveyard orbit on 19 May 1992.

University of California Johnston was a researcher at the University of California at Berkeley 1925-28 and an associate of cryogenics pioneer William Giauque when his experiments proved the existence of oxygen isotopes with atomic masses 17 and 18. Previously it had been believed that oxygen only existed as 16O; as atomic masses of other elements were calculated on the basis of 16.0 not 16.0035, this was a significant discovery. The work, published in 1929, also led to the discovery in 1932 of heavy hydrogen (deuterium) by Harold C Urey. Giauque was awarded the 1949 Nobel Prize for chemistry for this work, and did not forget to recognize Johnston's contribution. Ohio State University Johnston was appointed assistant professor at Ohio State University in 1929 with plans to create a cryogenics laboratory to rival that at Berkeley, but sufficient funds were not available until 1939, boosted by federal money earmarked for war-related research, notably the Manhattan Project, for which he was a director from 1942-46. A new building (titled War Research Building) was completed around the end of 1942 and the first liquid hydrogen was produced in February 1943. Johnston had a reputation for working himself and his staff hard, especially under tight deadlines. He was impatient with bureaucracy, and frequently ran into trouble with his propensity to cut corners. Despite, or perhaps because of these characteristics, he was admired by students and inspired great loyalty. One of his researchers, engineer Gwynne A Wright, remained with him for 16 years. One of his PhD students, Paul J Flory, who won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1974, cited Johnston's 'boundless zeal' as an inspiration.Paul J. Flory - Biographical He was appointed associate professor 1933-38, then professor 1938-54. During this time he also saw work at the University of Göttingen, Germany (1933) and General Electric laboratories at Schenectady, NY (1937). Business Johnston saw the US Government's decision to pursue research on a fission weapon (hydrogen bomb) as an opportunity to utilise his expertise in volume production, storage and transportation of liquid hydrogen (and deuterium). In 1952 he founded his own company H L Johnston Company Inc. to produce deuterium for the first 'thermonuclear device' which was successfully tested at Eniwetok Atoll on 1 November 1952. His company developed huge mobile refrigerated dewars for transporting bulk liquid hydrogen and even larger mobile plants for generating liquid hydrogen, for the US Air Force. He remained on the staff at Ohio State University all this time, but with a greatly reduced presence. Personal life Johnston married Margaret Vanderbilt (1901-1996) on 14 June 1923. They had two sons, William Vanderbilt and Robert Edgar, and a daughter, Margaret Louise. Recognition In 1970 the War Research Building at Ohio State University was renamed Johnston Laboratory in his honour.

He was known as a TV presenter, film actor, author and philanthropist. Critical of the healthcare system in the U.S., The Independent states his work rescued millions of uninsured Americans.  Early life  Stanley Edmunde Brock was born in 1936 in Preston, Lancashire, England. He grew up in Uplands, Swansea , where he enjoyed learning Welsh at school. He was educated at Canford School, Wimborne, Dorset. Brock travelled to Georgetown, British Guiana (now Guyana) in 1952 at the age of 17. He found work at the Dadanawa Ranch, managing the world's largest cattle ranch operation encompassing 4,000-square miles of rainforest and savannah. Dadanawa at that time contained over 30,000 Longhorn cattle and wild horses within the ranch. In time he would become the equivalent of the foreman among the other cowboys, or \\"Vaqueros,\\" as they referred to themselves. During his time in British Guiana, Brock also became a pioneer bush pilot which led to various certifications including airline transport pilot. It is here that the vision for his non-profit, Remote Area Medical, was born when he suffered an accident from one of the horses and was 26 days away on foot from the nearest medical care.alt=  Media career   Television  After Brock's time in British Guiana, he began co-hosting NBC's Emmy winning series, Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom with Marlin Perkins in 1968. The series became one of the most watched television shows in the United States, with more than 32 million weekly viewers. The show highlighted animals in their natural habitat and raised awareness of the environment.  Film  Brock starred in three films:The Corner Bar (1973), Escape from Angola (1976) and Galyon the Indestructible Man (1980). The later two films are classified as \\"Action Movies\\" and were productions of legendary Hollywood producer Ivan Tors. The Corner Bar was the only comedy film Stan performed in.  Writings  He was the author of three books on his experiences in Guyana: Leemo, A True Story of a Man's Friendship with a Mountain Lion (London, 1967), More about Leemo (London, 1967) and Jungle Cowboy (United States, 1969), republished in 1999 as All the Cowboys were Indians. He wrote various articles for magazines, including Readers Digest and Outdoor Life.  Philanthropy  Brock was the founder of the non-profit organization, Remote Area Medical (RAM). The organization's services primarily include dental, vision, and medical examinations for underserved populations. RAM veterinary care extends to companion animals, providing basic spay and neuter practices. RAM clinics operate throughout the United States and in other countries such as Haiti,India,Kenya, and Guyana. There is also an international disaster relief portion of RAM that serves areas affected. In August 2009, RAM operated temporary medical clinic in Los Angeles, offering free dental, vision, and medical treatment to thousands of Americans without medical insurance coverage. To date, RAM has operated more than 1,000 free clinics and provided more than $150 million in charitable care.  Personal life  According to a report in The Independent (UK), Brock \\"...has no money, no income, and no bank account. He spends 365 days a year at the charity events, sleeping on a small rolled-up mat on the floor and living on a diet made up entirely of porridge and fresh fruit.\\" The Independent also noted that Brock was married before establishing RAM and that the marriage collapsed as a result of Brock's obsessive dedication to the cause. The marriage produced no children; Brock acknowledged the lack of a family as one of the drawbacks of his lifestyle, stating: \\"I’m trying to think of a way to put this—would I like to be married? Yes. Would I like to have children? Yes. But I’ve got thousands of them now.\\" Brock was a karate black belt holder and physical fitness expert. He was an experienced pilot skilled in dealing with difficult landing sites. The discovery of a rare species of bat has been attributed to him, Vampyressa brocki.

Retrieved 20 December 2013 (21 July 1912 – 20 April 1970) was a Detective Chief Superintendent in the Metropolitan Police in London. He was most notable for leading the team of detectives that investigated the Great Train Robbery in 1963. He never married and lived with his mother. Butler was arguably the most renowned head of the Flying Squad in its history. He became known as \\"One Day\\" Tommy for the speed with which he apprehended criminals and the \\"Grey Fox\\" for his shrewdness. Family Butler was born in Fulham, west London. His mother's maiden name was Langthurne. Police career Butler was far from a typical policeman, he had a meteoric rise through the ranks, going from detective sergeant to chief superintendent in under a decade. Butler was utterly committed to his work, as a lifelong bachelor who lived with his mother in West London. He was a non- smoker and only moderate drinker.Crossing the Line (1995) by Bruce Reynolds (Pp 202–203) Butler was involved in an investigation of corrupt policemen in Brighton and also investigated and curtailed the activities of Jack Spot and Bill Hill.The Train Robber (1978) by Piers Paul Read. At one point in his career, he had even been sent to Cyprus before it gained independence from Britain in 1960, to advise the police on how to combat the Greek Cypriot group EOKA, led by General Grivas. From 1955–1959 EOKA waged an armed struggle against the British administration which aimed to achieve Enosis, or the union of Greece and Cyprus, similar to Crete and the Ionian Islands. The Great Train Robbery Initial Investigations Malcolm Fewtrell of Buckinghamshire CID and Detective Superintendent Gerald McArthur of Scotland Yard were in charge of carrying out the initial hunt for the thieves. McArthur was sent by Scotland Yard upon the request of the local police force, and had Detective Sergeant John Pritchard assisting him.No Fixed Address (1973) by Frank Williams George Hatherill, Commander of the C Department and Ernie Millen, Detective Chief Superintendent, and chief of the Flying Squad were initially in charge of the London side of the investigation. Train Robbery squad Butler became head of the Flying Squad shortly after the Great Train Robbery, after Millen became promoted to Deputy Commander to George Hatherill. On 12 August 1963 Butler was appointed to head the Police investigation of the London connection (with no local criminals capable of the robbery). He formed the six-man Train Robbery Squad: Detective Inspector Frank Williams, Detective Sergeant Steve Moore, Detective Sergeant Jack Slipper, Detective Sergeant Jim Nevill, Detective Sergeant Lou Van Dyck, and Detective Constable Tommy Thorburn The decision to publish photos of the wanted suspects was already made by Hatherill and Millen, despite strong protests from Tommy Butler and Frank Williams. This resulted in most of the robbers going to ground. The debate between the police and the robbers as to whether the police broke the law to convict them, and relied upon informants has raged on through the years. In particular the gang claim that Gordon Goody and the innocent Bill Boal were blatantly framed. 1964 trial The trial of the robbers began at Aylesbury Assizes, Buckinghamshire on 20 January 1964. Mr Justice Edmund Davis presided over the trial which lasted 51 days and included 613 exhibits and 240 witnesses. The jury retired to the Grange Youth Centre in Aylesbury to consider their verdict.Hodson, Tom (3 May 2007). \\"The crime of the century\\". The Buckingham and Winslow Advertiser. http://www.buckinghamtoday.co.uk/the- great-train-robbery/The-crime-of-the-century.2852468.jp. John Daly acquittal On 11 February 1964, there was a sensation, when John Daly was found to have no case to answer when his counsel, Mr W. Raeburn QC claimed that the evidence against his client was limited to his fingerprints' being on the monopoly set found at Leatherslade Farm and that he went underground after the robbery. He went on to say that Daly had played the Monopoly game with his brother in law Bruce Reynolds earlier in 1963 and that he had gone underground because he was associated with people publicly sought by the police; this was not proof of involvement in a conspiracy. The judge agreed and the jury was directed to acquit him.The Train Robbers (1978) by Piers Paul Read Frank Williams was shocked when this occurred, because owing to Butler's refusal to share information, he had no knowledge of the fact that Daly's prints were only on the Monopoly set. If he had known this, he could have asked Daly questions about the Monopoly set and have relieved him of his very effective alibi. Daly was also clever, however, in avoiding having a photo taken when he was arrested until he could shave his beard. This meant that there was no photo to show the lengths he had gone to, in order to change his appearance. No action was taken against Butler however, for his mistake in not ensuring the case against Daly was more thorough.No Fixed Address by Frank Williams (1973) Ch. Get Out of Gaol...Free (Pp 45–53). Verdicts On 15 April 1964 the proceedings ended with the judge describing the robbery as \\"a crime of sordid violence inspired by vast greed\\" and passing sentences of 30 years imprisonment on seven of the robbers.Jean Archer (1992). Buckinghamshire Headlines. Countryside Books. . Escape After the trial, two of the Great Train Robbers, Charlie Wilson and Ronnie Biggs escaped from captivity. On 12 August 1964, Charlie Wilson escaped from Winson Green Prison in Birmingham in under three minutes when a three-man team broke into the prison to extricate him. His escape team was never caught and the leader nicknamed \\"Frenchy\\" disappeared from the London criminal scene by the late '60s. Two weeks after his escape Wilson was in Paris for plastic surgery and to grow out his prison haircut. By November 1965, Wilson was in Mexico City visiting old friends Bruce Reynolds and Buster Edwards.Killing Charlie (2005) by Wensley Clarkson Eleven months after Wilson's escape, in July 1965, Biggs escaped from Wandsworth Prison, (only fifteen months into his sentence) via a furniture van parking alongside the prison walls. A ladder was dropped over the thirty foot wall into the prison, during outside exercise time, to allow four prisoners to escape, including Biggs. The escape was planned by recently released prisoner Paul Seaborne, with the assistance of two other ex-convicts Ronnie Leslie and Ronnie Black and support from Charmian Biggs. The plot saw two other prisoners interfere with the warders and allow Biggs and friend Eric Flower to escape. Seaborne was later caught by Butler and sentenced to four and a half years and Ronnie Leslie to three years for being the getaway driver. The two other prisoners who took advantage of the Biggs escape were captured after three months. Biggs and Flower paid significant money to get smuggled to Paris for plastic surgery. Biggs said he had to escape because of the length of the sentence and the severity of the prison conditions. The escape of Wilson and Biggs meant that five of the robbers were then on the run. Pursuit Throughout the 3 years, Jimmy White spent on the run with wife Sheree, and baby son Stephen, he was continually taken advantage of or let down by his friends and associates. His share of the money was dwindling rapidly with no hope of staying in the one place to earn more. On 10 April 1966 a new friend recognised him from photos in a newspaper and informed police. They arrested him at Littlestone while he was at home. According to the arresting officer, then Detective Sergeant Jack Slipper, he was sent to Littlestone by Tommy Butler, and that when he got there, White surrendered peacefully on condition that they treat his wife and child with great respect. During questioning by Slipper, White hinted that the police had stolen some of the money from the caravan as the sum reported was less than what White had left there. Slipper got White to draw a diagram of the hideaways that he had constructed in the caravan, allowing police to go back and find around £6,000 more that they had missed the first time.Slipper of the Yard (1981) by Jack Slipper (Pp 75–79) White had only £2,000 left with him of the robbery money at the time of the arrest, with the rest long gone or recovered from the caravan. He was tried in June 1966 at Leicester Assizes and plead guilty to robbery, in exchange the prosecution accepted his plea of not guilty to the charge of conspiracy to rob. Justice Nield only sentenced him to 18 years jail (far less than the original terms of 30 years for the others). With the capture of Jimmy White, finally in 1966 after 3 years on the run, only the exiled criminals of Bruce Reynolds, Buster Edwards, Charlie Wilson and Ronald Biggs were still on the run. On 6 June 1964, Bruce Reynolds arrived in Mexico City after leaving Britain shortly after the sentences were handed down at Aylesbury. Wife Angela and son Nicholas eventually left Britain after a period of surveillance and questioning by the police, and arrived in Mexico in July 1964. In early 1965 they were joined by Ronald \\"Buster\\" Edwards, wife June and daughter Nicolette. They were all dismayed at Jimmy White's capture and watched for news of his trial with interest. After his breakout from prison, Charlie Wilson visited the others in Mexico in late 1965, and stayed with the Edwards family for 6 weeks, before returning to Montreal in January 1966. Buster Edwards While Tommy Butler was concentrating on the search for gang leader, Bruce Reynolds, Frank Williams concentrated on the most likely candidate for surrender, Buster Edwards, to whom he sent various messages by talking to Edwards' London associates over a two-year period. For a while the Edwards family was happy, and took a holiday to the USA and then for two weeks in Canada visiting Charlie Wilson in Canada. But while the cash was coming through upon request from the Swiss bank accounts, more than £30,000 was lost as fees for this privilege and several times they were asked by tourists about any connection to the Great Train Robbery. June and Nicolette Edwards were deeply unhappy in Mexico, so Edwards was forced to use the exile as a temporary measure to arrange a deal to surrender for a reduced sentence. They followed news of Jimmy White's sentence of 18 years and thought it was a sign that a deal on much more favourable terms was possible. In early 1966, Edwards met at Excelsior Hotel, Cologne with an associate who had talked to Frank Williams about a deal. A surrender date was agreed as was discussion of the continuance of the Edwards' wigmaking business and other issues. Tommy Butler at this stage was involved in an investigation of a gun battle, and had left Williams in charge of the Flying Squad in his absence. On Friday 16 September 1966, the Edwards family left Mexico to return to Britain. At 1.00am on 19 September 1966, Bernie Carton called Detective Superintendent Frank Williams to say that Edwards was ready to surrender. Williams called Butler (who was not involved in the preparations) who was uninterested in the news, believing it a hoax, and asked to be woken if Edwards was actually collared. Williams then went alone to the house, wondering if it were a potentially lethal trap and came into a dimly lit house where he walked into an opulent room with a large mahogany table. Sitting at the table sipping a glass of brandy, was Buster Edwards, with three other men, including Williams' contact (said to be Bernie Canton by Piers Paul Read) and two \\"minders\\", as well as an attractive and immaculately dressed woman who served drinks. Buster had prepared a written statement which claimed that he had no part in the robbery but that he had been offered money to assist Jimmy White in cleaning up Leatherslade Farm. After Williams read the statement, Edwards signed it. He also claimed the Peta Fordham book was 'full of childish lies'. Upon his capture, he had only around £2,000 left of the money (half in a Swiss account and half with wife June). He was dramatically thinner than prior to the robbery and was unrecognisable to most of the Flying Squad. At 3.00am Butler arrived to question Edwards. There was a two-day trial at Nottingham Assizes on 8 and 9 December 1966, where Justice Milmo found Edwards was guilty of conspiracy to rob and robbery, and was sentenced to twelve years on the first count and 15 years on the second count, to be served concurrently. Serving 15 years was three times what Buster had hoped for, but 3 years less than White and half what the other robbers had got. There was public controversy over the failure of authorities to recover much of the money. In response to this, Frank Williams through his extensive contacts in the South London underworld tried to encourage the remaining robbers to surrender and get reduced sentences in return for also surrendering their share of the money. The remaining robbers were managing to stay one step ahead of the police and were largely out of the country. In his book \\"No Fixed Address\\" Frank Williams stated that some difficulty had come his way over the negotiations, even though he had kept Tommy Butler informed, and he had said he was keeping Ernie Millen informed. After visiting Butler on his deathbed however, Millen confirmed that Butler had never told him about them.No Fixed Address (1973) by Frank Williams (Pp 74–75) Williams had hoped to secure his promotion to head the Flying Squad, through the careful negotiation of Edwards' surrender. This was not the case however, particularly as there was no large sum of money now left for Edwards to return with. The lighter sentence greatly annoyed his superiors, who considered Williams unsuitable to succeed Butler when he retired.The Train Robbers (1978) by Piers Paul Read (P. 201) Postponing retirement Butler was still keen to pursue the robbers, but at 55 years old he would need to postpone his retirement to do so. After his success in securing Jimmy White and Buster Edwards, Tommy Butler got Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Joseph Simpson to suspend his retirement on his 55th birthday. This was because he was fanatical about continuing to lead the hunt for the remaining robbers. After Butler's suspension of retirement, in early 1968, Frank Williams gave up trying to head the Flying Squad and moved to Scotland Yard's Murder Squad (he retired in February 1971 and became QANTAS Security Superintendent for Europe and the Middle East). Butler's diligence paid off for him when he arrested Charlie Wilson in the town of Rigaud, Quebec, Canada on 25 January 1968. Charlie Wilson Charlie Wilson took up residence outside Montreal, Quebec, Canada on Rigaud Mountain in the upper-middle-class neighbourhood where the large, secluded properties are surrounded by trees. Wilson lived under the name Ronald Alloway, a name borrowed from a Fulham shopkeeper. He joined an exclusive golf club and participated in his local community activities. It was only when he invited his brother-in-law over from the UK for Christmas that Scotland Yard was able to track him down and recapture him. They waited three months before making their move, in hopes that Wilson would lead them to Reynolds, the last suspect still to be apprehended. Wilson was arrested on 25 January 1968 by Tommy Butler. Many in Rigaud petitioned to allow his wife and five daughters to stay in the Montreal area. Bruce Reynolds Reynolds was the last of the robbers to be caught. With Ronald (Buster) Edwards and family returned to the United Kingdom to arrange a deal with police, it was too risky for Reynolds to remain in Mexico. The Reynolds family left Mexico City on 6 December 1966, and went north through the USA, until they got to Canada for a visit to Charlie Wilson and family at their lakeside home in Rigaud outside Montreal on 23 December 1966. In early 1967, the Reynolds family returned to London, with Bruce trying his hand at several jobs, albeit largely unsuccessfully. When it became apparent that their key accomplice who was sheltering and moving them from address to address was being investigated by police, they were forced to leave London and settle in Villa Cap Martin, in Torquay, Devon. Reynolds also took his wife and son to the scene of the robbery and showed them around. Early in the morning on 8 November 1968, Nicholas Reynolds opened the front door in response to the doorbell being rung and a dozen policemen swarmed into the house and piled onto a startled Reynolds who was still in bed. Then Tommy Butler himself came into the room \\"Long time no see, Bruce. But I've got you at last\\". Reynolds could only smile and say \\"C'est la vie, Tom\\" This was the triumphant moment of Tommy Butler's career, with months to go before his retirement he had finally caught the leader of the Great Train Robbers. In a one on one interview, Reynolds took a deal where Butler agreed not to press charges nor use aggressive tactics against his family or friends. On 14 January 1969, at Buckingham Assizes, Aylesbury, Mr Justice Thomson imposed the sentence of twenty five years imprisonment on Reynolds. When asked by a reporter after the sentencing of Reynolds whether that was the end of it, Butler replied that it was not over until Ronnie Biggs was caught. It appears that Butler did have some information on Biggs from an informant, as Detective Sergeant Keith Dugard released pictures of Biggs on a cruise liner from Australia to Brazil, that he said were entrusted to him by Butler. He said that Butler asked him to keep them secret (presumably because one of the people pictured with Biggs was his informant). The picture was valuable in that it showed what Biggs looked like after plastic surgery. Retirement and death In early 1969, Butler left by compulsory retirement. According to Bruce Reynolds, he had a job as Head of Security lined up with Midland Bank in January 1969. Butler died in 1970, aged 57 years. His death was reported on the same day that Biggs' memoirs were published in the Sun. Ernie Millen and Frank Williams (both recently retired) visited Butler on his deathbed in hospital. Legacy In 1973, Frank Williams, his Train Robbery Squad deputy wrote his account of the investigation in a book \\"No Fixed Address\\" in which he carefully criticises Butler and invites Biggs to make contact with him. In 1981, Jack Slipper, one of his Train Robbery Squad wrote his autobiography \\"Slipper of the Yard\\" which includes an account of the train robbery investigation in which he criticises Butler's autocratic style and secretive nature, but is respectful of his talents as a fearless and dogged investigator. In May 2001, aged 71 and having suffered three strokes, Ronnie Biggs voluntarily returned to Britain and was promptly arrested and imprisoned. On 6 August 2009, Biggs was granted release from prison on \\"compassionate grounds\\" due to a severe case of pneumonia, after serving only part of the sentence imposed at trial (he did serve more than the other robbers).

Branzetti, Photographer April 3, 1941 (c) EXT.- WEST GABLE END, LOOKING UP - Faulkner House, High Street, Acton, Middlesex County, MA The Faulkner House is the oldest colonial-era structure still standing in Acton, Massachusetts. The Faulkner House was purchased in 1964 by 'Iron Work Farm in Acton, Inc.', a Massachusetts non- profit corporation with a charter \\"to acquire and preserve the tangible landmarks of the area historically known as Iron Work Farm\\", now part of Acton. The Faulkner House is now being preserved under its stewardship. History The Faulkner house was originally built for Ephraim Jones (1679–1710), the founder in 1702 of an early textile business and other mills that formed the nucleus of the present town of Acton. Being the largest and most central house of this settlement, it served as the local garrison house for protection during Indian raids made along the Massachusetts frontier during Queen Anne's War (1702–1713).Homestead history Ammi Ruhamah Faulkner rented the house and mills in 1738, then purchased them in 1742. For 202 years, the Faulkner House was the homestead for six generations of the Faulkner family. The family carried on the processing of woolen cloth at the fulling mill across the road from the house; the mill was said to have been one of the earliest attempts in the United States to manufacture woolen cloth on a large scale. American Revolution The Faulkner homestead served as a garrison for the South Acton Militia during the American Revolutionary War. As Paul Revere rode to raise alarm on April 18, 1775, he found that he would need more riders to continue the message. In Lexington, Revere found, and enlisted the help of, Dr. Samuel Prescott. Dr. Prescott was sent to Concord, and then to Acton. Prescott, after informing Captain Joseph Robbins, Isaac Davis, and Deacon Simon Hunt of the news, went to South Acton and then to the Faulkner house. Upon receiving the news, Major Francis Faulkner fired off three shots, the signal alarm, and soon the militia of Acton had assembled at the house. From Acton, a man named Edward Bancroft carried the message on towards Groton and Pepperell. The Faulkner House and Jones Tavern are two historic properties in South Acton that are owned by Iron Work Farm in Acton, Inc., a non-profit, historical Massachusetts corporation with a charter to study the documents and preserve the tangible landmarks connected with the village of [South] Acton.

Birth control Contraception Albino Luciani had mixed feelings regarding the traditional Catholic teaching on contraception when the issue came to prominence in the wake of the Second Vatican Council. In 1968, as Bishop of Vittorio Veneto, he submitted a confidential report to his predecessor as Patriarch of Venice arguing that the recently developed contraceptive pill should be permitted by the church. The report was agreed to by fellow Veneto bishops and submitted to Paul VI.John Julius Norwich, The Popes, London, 2011 p. 445 After Paul VI issued the encyclical Humanae Vitae, Luciani defended it publicly. But in a letter to his diocese on July 29, 1968, shortly after publication of the encyclical, he wrote, \\"I must confess that I hoped in my heart, even though I didn't let it out in writing, that the very serious difficulties could be overcome and that the reply of the Teacher, who speaks with a special charism and in the name of the Lord, might coincide with the hopes raised in so many couples, especially after the establishment of a special pontifical commission to examine the issue.\\" Nevertheless, he added, \\"I am confident that I have everyone with me in a sincere adherence to the papal teaching.\\"Albino Luciani/Giovanni Paolo I, Opera Omnia (Padua: Edizioni Messagero, 1989), vol. 3, pp. 300-301. Investigative writer David Yallop claims that Luciani referred to several encyclicals and pronouncements from Pope Paul VI but never referred publicly to Humanae Vitae as pope himself. In May 1978, John Paul I was invited to speak at a conference in Milan to be held that June to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the encyclical. He refused both to speak and to attend.John Julius Norwich, The Popes, London, 2011, p. 445 He supposedly informed his secretary of state Cardinal Jean Villot that, regarding Humanae Vitae, \\"we cannot leave the situation as it currently stands.\\" In God's Name: An Investigation into the Murder of Pope John Paul I by David Yallop, p. 156 In another conversation with Cardinal Villot on September 19, 1978, he reportedly told the secretary of state that \\"We have been discussing birth control for forty-five minutes... during that period of time we have been talking over one thousand children under the age of five have died of malnutrition. God does not always provide.\\"In God's Name: An Investigation into the Murder of Pope John Paul I by David Yallop, p. 15p It is certain John Paul I would not have reversed Paul VI's teaching, namely on contraception, since it was a question of sexual ethics and church doctrine, rather than one of personal opinion.Kay Withers, \\"Pope John Paul I and Birth Control,\\" America, 24 March 1979, pp. 233–34 Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume John Paul I would not have insisted upon the negative judgement in Humanae Vitae as aggressively and publicly as John Paul II did. Some take a different view, claiming that while serving as Patriarch of Venice \\"Luciani was intransigent with his upholding of the teaching of the Church and severe with those, who through intellectual pride and disobedience paid no attention to the Church's prohibition of contraception\\", though while not condoning the sin, he was tolerant of those who sincerely tried and failed to live up to the Church's teaching.\\" The book also states that \\"if some people think that his compassion and gentleness in this respect implies he was against Humane Vitae one can only infer it was wishful thinking on their part and an attempt to find an ally in favor of artificial contraception.\\"Kay Withers, \\"Pope John Paul I and Birth Control,\\" America, March 24, 1979, pp. 233-34 Abortion In his letter to Carlo Goldoni in Illustrissimi, Luciani took a strongly critical view of abortion, arguing that it violated God's law and went against the deepest aspirations of women, disturbing them profoundly. Homosexuality In a 1974 interview in Venice, Luciani publicly upheld the traditional line: \\"A sexuality that is worthy of man must be a part of love for a person of a different sex with the added commitments of fidelity and indissolubility.\\"Interview with Il Gazzettino, February 12, 1974, p. 7 Artificial insemination In an interview shortly before the death of Pope Paul VI, when asked for his reaction to the birth of the first test-tube baby Louise Brown, Luciani, while expressing concerns about the possibility that artificial insemination could lead to women being used as \\"baby factories,\\" refused to condemn the parents. However he said he wouldn't deviate from the norm. He said, \\"From every side the press is sending its congratulations to the English couple and best wishes to their baby girl. In imitation of God, who desires and loves human life, I too offer my best wishes to the baby girl. As for her parents, I do not have any right to condemn them; subjectively, if they have acted with the right intention and in good faith, they may even obtain great merit before God for what they have decided on and asked the doctors to carry out.\\" He added, \\"Getting down, however, to the act in itself, and good faith aside, the moral problem which is posed is: is extrauterine fertilization in vitro or in a test tube, licit?... I do not find any valid reasons to deviate from this norm, by declaring licit the separation of the transmission of life from the marriage act.\\"Prospettive nel Mondo, August 1, 1978; Luciani, Opera Omnia, vol. 8, pp. 571-72.

The village is named after the Eallaiyur temple, located at the border of Gangaikonda Cholapuram.  Geography  Elaiyur Village is comprising seven regions: Elaiyur (West), Elaiyur (West), Elaiyur (South), Elaiyur (Southeast), Kandiyankollai, Koriyampatti and Palla Kulam (Northeast). Areas surrounding and within Elaiyur have been known to be sedimentary depositional environments. Field/outcrops prominence, such as bed geometry, sedimentary structure, texture, erosional surfaces, etc., indulge as confirmation for depositional environments. Magnetic susceptibility in the areas within and surrounding Elaiyur is not uncommon. The magnetic fabric in the sedimentary rocks, surrounding Elaiyur, can develop during deposition (primary fabric) and even after deposition (secondary fabrics) of the sediments as a result of bioturbation, compaction and tectonic disturbances (Rees 1961). Magnetic samples of Kallankurichchi limestone have been deemed suitable for magnetic fabric studies due to its high magnetic susceptibility. Elaiyur and surrounding areas are also known for rare, distinctive, shell microstructures. Optical microscopic observations and SEM studies of the shells, in this area, of six genera clearly indicate that all the four sub-families consist of distinctive set of shell-microstructures.  Notable locations  There are several notable temples in this region. Selliyammen Koil is a temple located in Sendurai on Jayamkondam's Main Road. The Selliyammen Koil Festival (செல்லியம்மன் கோயில் தேர் திருவிழா) is a well-known festival in this district that takes place once a year at the end of May. The Marriyammen Temple and Shiva Temple are located near the village's administrative office. There are two Vijayanagar Temples in Elaiyur. One is located near Malangan Lake, and the other is located near Canara Bank. Ayyanar Temple is located in Elaiyur South (தெற்கு வேலி), and Vreenar Temple is located in Eliyur West, where a festival occurs once a year. Elaiyur Village contains three large lakes: the Malangan Lake, the South Veli Lake, and Palla Kulam Canara Bank are located in Elaiyur South.  Population  As of 2011 Elaiyur had a population of 6393 of which 3052 are males while 3341 are females, 3402 were employed. 59.11% of workers describe their work as Main Work (Employment or Earning more than 6 Months) while 40.89% were involved in Marginal activity providing livelihood for less than 6 months. Of 3402 workers engaged in Main Work, 743 were cultivators (owner or co-owner) while 661 were Agricultural labourers. Elaiyur is made up of 1738 families. The population age 0-6 is 650 which makes up 10.17% of total population of village. Average sex ratio of Elaiyur village is 1095 which is higher than Tamil Nadu state average of 996. Child sex ratio for the Elaiyur as per census is 862, lower than Tamil Nadu average of 943. Elaiyur village has lower literacy rate compared to Tamil Nadu. In 2011, literacy rate of Elaiyur village was 67.65% compared to 80.09% of Tamil Nadu. In Elaiyur Male literacy stands at 79.91% while female literacy rate was 56.74%.

LAA targets have to reflect the vision, priorities and challenges set out in the Sustainable Community strategy, which are 10-year vision statements for a given area required by national government. LAA targets are chosen in discussion with all partners, and are then negotiated with Government Departments, working through Regional Government Offices. In two-tier counties (i.e. counties with both district and county councils) LAAs are drawn up by the upper-tier authorities, that is, counties, unitaries, London boroughs. Government provides a reward grant at the end of 3 years if LAA targets have been achieved. LAAs were first introduced in 2004/05, starting with 20 pilot areas and extending across the country in three phases. The Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 placed LAAs on statutory footing.

The Standard Athletic Club won the first French football championship in 1894, and then again in 1895, 1897, 1898 and 1901. It also represented France for the one and only Cricket match in the 1900 Olympics.  History  The Club was founded on 1 March 1890, in the back-room of the \\"Horse shoe\\" bar at rue Copernic in the 8th arrondissement. The club won the first ever Football Championship of France in 1894 and supplied most of the French team that played the only cricket match ever to be held in an Olympiad, at the Paris 1900 Olympic Games. Up to the war, the main sporting activities were football, tennis, field hockey, and cricket. The hockey teams played in the national First Division. In its early days, the Club was simply a loose association of young Britons who wanted to play sport together in the bois de Boulogne, but gradually grew to a size where playing fields were rented in 1906 at the Val d’Or in Suresnes. In 1922, the historic decision to ensure a permanent home for the Club led to the purchase of the present grounds in Meudon. During World War II, the Club was taken over and used as a radar jamming station. Just prior to the Liberation of Paris in 1944, the entire top storey was blown up. The new clubhouse was inaugurated by HM Queen Elizabeth II in 1957 and 1972. The swimming pool was opened in 1962; the golf section made its debut in 1979; and the first squash court was built in 1976. A Standard Athletic Club member was the first squash champion of France.

At its peak in 1928, the organisation carried 328 million passengers on 953 trams, via 46 routes, along of track. It was the United Kingdom's second largest tram network after the services of 16 operators across the capital were combined in 1933 by the London Passenger Transport Board. Other large systems were in Glasgow (which had 100 miles of double track at its peak and Birmingham (80 miles). The central and south central Manchester area had one of the densest concentrations of tram services of any urban area in the UK. MCT services ran up to the edge of routes provided by other operators in (what is now) Greater Manchester, and in some instances had running rights over their lines and vice versa. There were extensive neighbouring systems in Salford, Oldham, Ashton, Hyde, Middleton, Rochdale and elsewhere. Services were withdrawn earlier than most other British cities to be replaced by trolleybus and motor buses. Trams did not return to the city until the modern light-rail system Manchester Metrolink opened in 1992. History Though horse-drawn omnibuses were first introduced in Manchester as early as 1824 (arguably the world's first bus service it was run by John Greenwood and ran between Market Street and Piccadilly and Pendleton toll gate in Salford). In the subsequent years other companies joined the rush to provide services culminating by 1850 in 64 omnibuses serving the centre of Manchester from outlying areas. Passenger carrying trams had first began urban operation in Birkenhead in 1860. By 1865 Greenwood merged with the other operators to become the Manchester Carriage Company. The earliest proposals for the construction of rails on the streets of Manchester were made by Henry Osborn O'Hagan in 1872. Though these were resisted (partly because raised tram tracks had been the sources of many accidents elsewhere), by 1875, road congestion was so great that the 'tramway' could not be delayed much longer. Working with the Corporation of Salford, Manchester successfully gained orders under the Tramways Act 1870, which permitted them to build and lease, but expressly not to operate, tramways. The first tracks therefore were built to allow the already existing lines from neighbouring Salford to run into the city along Deansgate. As extensions and new lines were agreed, the Manchester Suburban Tramways Company was formed in 1877 to operate horse-drawn trams on the lines constructed by both local authorities. The company had a total fleet of more than 90 horse-drawn vehicles, and, in 1877, it was they who gained the concession to operate the tramway, using the name 'Manchester & Salford Tramways'. By 1901 this company used 5,000 horses to pull 515 tramcars over 140 route miles. Their first service therefore began on 17 May 1877, between Deansgate and Grove Inn on the Bury New Road. Just three years later a new organisation was formed called the Manchester Carriage and Tramways Company that continued with the expansion. By the 1890s it had turned itself into the most important transit operator in Lancashire. At their height, the company had 5,300 horses, pulling 515 tram cars on almost 90 miles of route using 515 cars. By 1896 outlying areas served included; Ashton-under-Lyne, Audenshaw, Droylsden, Failsworth, Gorton & Denton, Heaton Norris, Kersal, Levenshulme, Lower Broughton, Moss Side, Peel Green, Stalybridge, Stockport, Stretford, Swinton, Waterhead and Withington. There were also other horse-drawn tram services operating independently in some of the other settlements surrounding Manchester – notably Bolton and Stockport. Another company which had been set up by Henry O'Hagan proposed a tram network for all the urban areas east of Manchester, from Bacup in the north via Rochdale, Oldham and Ashton to Hyde. The first Manchester, Bury, Rochdale and Oldham Steam Tramways Company line opened in 1883, though by 1887 the company was declared bankrupt. A new company with almost the same name was begun in 1888 (simply by deleting the word \\"Manchester\\" from its name) and successfully ran steam tramways until the municipalities began building and operating routes at the turn of the 20th century. The Wigan and District Tramways Company ran tram services between 1880 and 1902. On the other side of Manchester, the Trafford family sold their land following the opening of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, creating the Trafford Park Estates Company, which built a gas-powered tramway to serve the new factories in 1897. It was replaced by an electric powered tram line within the industrial estate from July 1903. The idea of local authorities running tram systems was developed locally in both Bolton and Wigan when in 1899 the corporations bought the routes of the E. Holden & Company. This enabled investment and conversion of the Bolton lines to electric traction during December of that year (followed in 1901 by Wigan). In 1900 the South Lancashire Tramways Company was formed (later renamed Lancashire United Tramways and again Lancashire United Transport in 1905), which ran an extensive inter-urban system from Atherton. Birth of Manchester Corporation Tramways A Manchester tram in June 1902 The Manchester Carriage and Tramways Company leases were due to expire between 1898 and 1901, so the Corporation of Manchester agreed in 1895 to take over and modernise the existing tramways themselves. They sent inspectors to view the systems operated elsewhere in order to assess the best means of traction power and delivery for Manchester. The systems examined were: underground conduit, storage batteries, cable- hauled (used in Edinburgh), steam-powered (used by Leeds trams), oil, gas (utilised in Lytham St Annes) and a delegation was even sent to Paris to examine their compressed air system. The decision was then taken to use electrical power carried overhead but the track itself needed complete overhaul from the horse-drawn days and at some junctions the track needed was to be so complex it even had to be ordered from the United States. It was thought that the initial requirement would be for as many as 600 electric cars but although this estimate was revised down to 400 it was still such a large number that it was beyond the manufacturing capacity of the period. Instead of having the entire network and fleet ready for the proposed opening in 1901, the Corporation gradually replaced the old Manchester & Salford Tramway routes as vehicles became available. Notwithstanding, over one hundred cars were delivered before the system actually opened from 1899 onwards. Manchester London Road station in the 1900s. The location for a new electrically equipped depot needed to be accessible to the first route so land on Queen's Road, Cheetham (part of a later extension to that depot is now home to the Greater Manchester's Museum of Transport) was purchased and on 12 June 1900, the foundation stone was laid. Following the installation of power lines between Albert Square and Cheetham Hill, this first part of the new operation was inaugurated on 6 June 1901 with public services starting the next day. It took £1,500,000 and until 1903 to rebuild and re-equip the rest of the then 140 mile network, and to receive delivery of the full set of new tram cars (mainly double-deck but with some single decks (known as California cars)—mainly used on the L-shaped route 53—were also ordered), but on 13 April that year, horses pulled their last trams within Manchester. Horse-drawn trams in London by comparison, continued until 1915. By the end of 1901, further sections had been opened between Cheetham Hill Road and Rochdale Road; Deansgate and Hightown; High Street and Blackley; High Street and Moston Lane; and High Street and Queens Park. Only 252 cars could housed at the Queen's Road depot so a further depot was constructed at Devonshire Street / Hyde Road in Ardwick—and it was opened at the end of 1902. Expansion and peak Tram lines in central Manchester and Salford, ca. 1933 1901–1910 The Audenshaw transformer pillar From 1902 onwards both Salford and Manchester tram systems, uniquely in Britain, employed uniformed \\"trolley boys\\" – over a thousand at their peak (Jan 1930) – whose job it was to assist guards on double-truck trams by giving the driver a bell signal at the stops and helping passengers on and off. Because by the early 1900s there were multiple organisations owning various sections of tramways in the Manchester and surrounding areas, Manchester took the lead in rebuilding and electrifying their routes so that they could be leased back for operational services. The largest boroughs (Ashton-under-Lyne, Oldham and Salford) continued to operate their own lines and began their own modernisation. At Bury, Oldham and Rochdale, the steam services were also brought under the control of the local municipalities. In 1904 the Glossop Urban District Supply Company was set up to provide electric trams to Dukinfield, Glossop, Hyde, Mossley, and Stalybridge. The short 2.5 mile run in Trafford Park came under the joint control of the Corporations of Manchester and Salford. The tracks arrived in Piccadilly, home of the Corporation Tramway offices, on 1 June 1902. By the end of the following year services from Piccadilly reached: Alexandra Park, Audenshaw, Denton, Hollinwood, Moss Side, Old Trafford, Openshaw, Newton Heath, St. Peter's Square and Stretford. By 1903 Manchester Corporation had just over 300 cars. The trams were also used to carry parcels from 1905. As late as winter 1905, horse-drawn buses still ran between Palatine Road and Cheadle and on down to Northenden, as well as on the route between Chorlton- cum-Hardy and Hulme. Manchester Corporation Tramways proposed an experimental motor bus to replace them from 1906, effectively and portentously becoming both a tram and bus operator. By 1910, the 582 cars in service running over 100 route miles were generating a profit of £150,000. Yet another depot was needed and Princess Road in Moss Side was opened on 9 June 1909 which would house nearly 300 tram cars. 1911–1920 Tram number 765 in Heaton Park (formerly used on service 53 through Moss Side)No. 763-767 single-decker trams built 1913 used on this route due to a low bridge ; pp. 62–65 In the run up to the start of the First World War there was an enormous expansion and consolidation of tram services to the extent that by 1915 trams were the most popular form of transit; the Manchester system was carrying 200 million passenger journeys a year on 662 vehicles (there were only a handful of buses at this time). It was then possible to traverse by tram the entire urban area now known as Greater Manchester, and far into the surrounding towns of Lancashire and Cheshire, many of which had their own independent services. The extent of this inter-urban tram running compares with that found in parts of Belgium. Many of these services were also amalgamating or joint running. Stockport trams ran directly into Manchester with routes to Cheadle, Hazel Grove and Hyde. By 1913 there were so many services running in and out of Manchester city centre that the route names had to be replaced with route numbers – up to 46 MCT numbered routes are known though there were also some sub-sets of these routes. Despite the arrest of development and damage of the war years between 1914–1918 transport expansion was quick to be re- established. Women had been employed during the war as tram guards but there were shortages of materials and maintenance staff that led to deterioration of both the track and the vehicle fleet. In 1918 the city's Medical Officer of Health closed the tram network to help stop the spread of Spanish flu. 1921–1930 In 1921 the Manchester Corporation formed a new body with Ashton Corporation and Stalybridge Joint Board which took over the Oldham, Ashton and Hyde Tramway allowing Manchester trams to run on the Ashton via Guide Bridge section. Due to price rises after the war, operational costs rose from £681,000 in 1919 to £1,520,000 by 1922. This led to calls from some quarters for tram expansion to be halted. Middleton Electric Traction Company was jointly taken over by Middleton, Chadderton and Rochdale authorities in 1923. Middleton then granted Manchester a lease to operate on their former tracks in exchange for allowing them to run Corporation trams right into Rochdale. Buses became one of the fastest growth areas (Manchester Corporation went from 16 vehicles in 1923 to 51 in 1926). However new tram lines were still being commissioned especially on the south side of the city (serving Anson Rd, Birchfields Rd, Kingsway, Platt Lane, Princess Road, Seymour Grove) and also in the north (at Heywood, Middleton and on Victoria Avenue). A final addition to the tram system came in 1928 when it was connected with the Bury Corporation system from the Middleton line to Hopwood in Heywood. This expansion signalled the maximum extent the MCT system reached in 1929–30 with 123 route miles (292 track miles) and 953 electric cars, making it the third largest system in the country. Only the tram networks serving (what became Greater) London (around 400 route miles) and Glasgow (about 170 route miles) were bigger. Decline and replacement In spring 1929 a decision was needed to replace track on the circular 53 route. Because the tracks passed beneath a number of low bridges, running double deck trams had been impossible. In order to increase capacity it would have been necessary to increase the bridge height and that was seen as prohibitively expensive so the decision was taken by the new general manager Mr. Stuart Pilcher, to replace the trams with motorbuses between Stretford Road and Cheetham Hill. The effect was to increase passenger numbers by 11 percent and the route became profitable to operate; thus commencing the start of tramway abandonment. In recognition of the growing importance of bus services, Pilcher managed to get the company name changed to Manchester Corporation Transport this year. A pothole reveals old tram tracks under Lever Street, Manchester Elsewhere profits were being made on Express bus services, 27 in all, many running on the same routes as trams. In the early 1930s, tramcar revenue was lower than operating costs on some services and yet more replacement work was due and more buses were introduced. The City Council decided to abandon plans to extend the tramway to the new and rapidly expanding large council housing estate of Wythenshawe and to withdraw the trolley boys. No more new trams were ordered. Pilcher organised the UK's first major conversion of an intensively used tram route to buses in the United Kingdom when on 6 April 1930 the service from Cheetham Hill to Stretford Road was abandoned to the motorbus. Manchester's bus fleet then numbered over 100, and with lower overheads and profits increasing after conversion, Pilcher was seen as the man who persuaded some cynics that trams were outdated for British cities and that buses were the future. Thirty years after their initial opening, the old tram routes were showing the need for capital expenditure on new infrastructure – Pilcher used this as one of the main reasons to push ahead with conversion to buses. Major investment was needed for bridge widening on the long route to Altrincham, therefore in June 1931 the trams were replaced by buses. It was followed a month later by the line to Sale Moor and in 1932 the long run up to Middleton got the chop. 12 November 1932 saw the Rochdale to Manchester trams being pulled out of service by Rochdale Corporation. In 1936 the council decided to replace the old trams on Ashton Old Road with new trolleybuses. A depot for the Manchester trolleybus system was opened on Rochdale Road in 1936. By March 1938, 75 miles of single track tramway had been abandoned and 21 tram routes converted to motor or trolleybus. In 1939, 351 new motor buses and 77 trolleybuses were ordered (although 236 of the motor buses arrived before the start of the Second World War). Intact tram lines near the end of Great Clowes Street in Salford The final decision to completely abandon the tram system in favour of trolley buses and motor buses was taken on 7 July 1937 but the onset of war delayed some of this. However, during the war 4917 tons of steel were turned over to the war effort by removing abandoned tram tracks. In 1945 the final SHMD Joint Board tramcar ran, the last tram in Oldham followed in 1946, and those in Bolton and Salford ended in 1947. By 1949 just a few miles of track were left in Manchester and the last tram ran on 10 January of that year. The last of the old tram cars were stored at Hyde Road depot until on 16 March they were set ablaze in a huge bonfire, permanently signifying an end to what was once the third largest tramway system in the country. A few trams were sold to other operators: the last of these in public service were in Aberdeen, in 1956. The trams continued in Bury for a further month and the last tram ran in Stockport during 1951. The trolley bus routes remained until they were also abandoned by December 1966. Museums A short line in Heaton Park has been restored to occasional service, and currently has an operating fleet of 3 electric trams and one horse tram. One of these, tramcar, No 765, was used as a chicken coop for many years before being restored in the 1960s by a group of enthusiasts working under the guidance of retired tramways employees at MCTD's Birchfields depot. Once work had been completed it was stored at the museum at Crich in Derbyshire, before permanently moving to Heaton Park in 1979.

She married Infante Philip, younger son of Philip V of Spain, who inherited the Duchy of Parma from his mother in 1748, thereby founding the House of Bourbon- Parma. In secondary sources she is referred to also as \\"Louise Élisabeth of France\\".Campbell Orr, C. (ed.) Queenship in Europe 1660–1815: the role of the consort.

Marie Louise Élisabeth and her younger twin sister Henriette were born at the Palace of Versailles on 14 August 1727 to Louis XV of France and queen Maria Leszczyńska. Along with her twin, she was baptised at Versailles on 27 April 1737 with the names of her parents. As a legitimate daughter of the king, she was a fille de France, but was known at court as Madame Royale, Madame Première, Madame Élisabeth, and also as Babette within her family circle. She was put in the care of Marie Isabelle de Rohan, duchesse de Tallard. Élisabeth was raised at Versailles with Henriette, their younger sisters Marie Louise, Marie Adélaïde, and their brother, Louis, Dauphin of France. Her younger sisters, Victoire, Sophie, Marie Thérèse and Louise Marie, were sent to be raised in the Abbey of Fontevraud in June 1738. Élisabeth was regarded as being not as pretty as her twin: her nose was considered too short and too broad, her face too plump, her forehead too high and her complexion too dark and sometimes blotchy. She was sometimes described as dull and indolent, but usually as vivacious and decided: it was said of her that she \\"knew how to exact obedience and to get her own way\\", and she was generally considered as quite charming and a \\"pleasing, piquant and intelligent personality\\". In February 1739, when she was eleven years old, her engagement to the Infante Philip of Spain was announced. Philip was the third son of Louis XV's uncle, Philip V d'Anjou, King of Spain, and Elizabeth of Parma. This engagement followed a tradition dating back to 1559 of cementing military and political alliances between the Catholic powers of France and Spain with royal marriages. Despite this, the announcement of the marriage agreement was not well received at the French court, as there was little chance that Philip would become king of Spain, and that only a marriage with a crown prince or a king was deemed worthy of a princess of France. The barrister Barbier wrote in his diary \\"It seems extraordinary that the eldest Daughter of France is not marrying a crowned head\\", and d'Argenson speculated that the marriage was arranged only because of a plan to make Don Philip king of Naples and Sicily. Élisabeth herself \\"considered her destiny to be less glorious than she had the right to expect\\", and when she was asked if she would not feel pleased to be called Infanta, her face reportedly \\"contracted into a scornful grimace\\". The twelve-year-old Élisabeth was married by proxy in Versailles on 26 August 1739, and thereafter known as Madame Infanta in France. When she left for Spain in September, the king was reportedly so moved that he entered her carriage and accompanied her for the first miles on her journey. She passed the border and met her nineteen-year-old husband some thirty kilometers northeast of Madrid, at Alcalá de Henares, where the marriage took place on 25 October 1739. Infanta of Spain Élisabeth made a personal success upon her arrival in Spain and was soon the \\"idol of Madrid\\". She made favorable impressions on her father-in-law, king Philip V, and her spouse, prince Philip, although her relationship with her mother-in-law, Elisabeth of Parma soon became one of mutual dislike. The queen was displeased that Élisabeth's dowry was not paid by France, nor did France assist Spain in the war with Britain; further more, after about six months the queen reportedly realized that she would not be able to control or dominate Élisabeth, as she was accustomed to do with her husband and son, and that her daughter-in-law could potentially replace her own influence over her son. As a result, Elisabeth spent most of her time away from the Queen, playing with dolls and wrote of her unhappiness to her father. Élisabeth in hunting dress, by Jean-Marc Nattier. Élisabeth soon came to dominate Philip; though he was eight years her senior, he, as his father, was reportedly of a timid, passive and submissive nature, and Élisabeth reportedly felt affection for him but generally treated him as \\"a boy much younger than herself although he was her senior by eight years\\". De Luynes later observed: \\"Although the Prince at twenty-eight is as much of a child as he was at fourteen or fifteen, he has, nevertheless, an affectionate regard for the Infanta.\\" Élisabeth was described as \\"keen, ambitious and enterprising, untiring in her energies and passionately fond of her changing Europe to the advantage of her House, of imbuing everyone with a love for France and of making her son a prince worthy of his great French forefathers\\". She was not satisfied with her position as the spouse of a prince with no prospects of being King; she kept in contact with the French court, in particular with her twin, informed her brother the Dauphin of all events at the Spanish court, and had already by 1740 established a net of contacts at the French court to assist her in her ambition to obtain an independent position for herself and her spouse, \\"worthy of the birth of both\\". Her twin Henriette, otherwise regarded as habitually apathetic of politics, was reportedly passionately devoted to work for the political ambition of her elder twin Élisabeth, as did her younger sister Adelaide and her sister-in-law Infanta Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain; the powerful Noailles and Jean-Frédéric Phélypeaux, Count of Maurepas allied with the queen to achieve the same, and the French ambassador at Madrid, Monseigneur Vaurdal, Archbishop of Reims, was reportedly so willing to be of assistance that he was ridiculed for it. In 1741, Philip was called to serve in the War of the Austrian Succession, through which it was hoped that he would be able to secure one of the duchies of Northern Italy. Her mother-in-law Queen Elisabeth reportedly made sure that Philip stayed in camp for almost all of the War, separated from his wife, in order to prevent her from replacing his mother in his affection; through their correspondence, the queen repeatedly asked her son if he loved his wife: \\"I want to know if you love . : [the sign which Elisabeth Farnese used to denote her daughter-in-law when writing to her son] Tell me the truth!\\" Despite the mutual antipathy between Élisabeth and her mother-in-law they were in fact united in their ambitions for prince Philip. During the war, Queen Elisabeth worked to secure her son Philip a throne in Italy, while her daughter-in-law used her net of contacts to do the same. Their goal was achieved with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. Duchess of Parma Louise Élisabeth by Jean-Marc Nattier, c. 1754. In the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle which ended the War of the Austrian Succession, Empress Maria Theresa ceded the duchies of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla to Ferdinand VI of Spain. At Louis XV's instigation, Philip was created Duke of Parma. Louise Élisabeth as Duchess of Parma, by Charles-André van Loo. Élisabeth was pleased with her new position, however she felt it necessary to obtain an income independent of Spain, so she left for the French court with the ambition to secure an income from her father. Élisabeth was met in Choisy by her twin and her brother the Dauphin. She arrived in Versailles on the 11 December 1748 with a retinue composed of her camarera mayor the Marquise de Lcyde, her secretary of state the Duque de Monteiano as major domo-in-chief, and three maids-of-honour. The French court was amazed over her lack of pomp; it was said that she did not appear to own more clothes than those she had brought with her from France nine years earlier. She was described as clever, quick and practical, with a robust strength of mind, and efficiently focused on state affairs. A courtier described Élisabeth as \\"charming\\" with \\"piercing eyes\\" that \\"express(ed) intelligence\\" while another, less sympathetic observer claimed she looked like a \\"well-endowed young woman, matured by motherhood\\".Lévêque, Jean-Jacques, Versailles: The Palace of the Monarchy, The Museum of the Nation, translated by Kirk McElhearn and Ellen Krabbe, ACR PocheCouler, Paris, 2000, p. 113. During her stay at Versailles, she spent most of her time with her father the king, who visited her several times daily via a private staircase to discuss business with her. She successfully achieved her goal when her father granted two hundred thousand francs for the Duke of Parma. Her strong will and influence on her father reportedly worried his maîtresse-en-titre, Madame de Pompadour. When she left Versailles on 18 October 1749, she brought a French retinue of followers, a trousseau and so many gowns that D’Argenson commented that her journey had cost the State twelve hundred thousand livres. Isabella in Fontainebleau, by Jean-Marc Nattier. In December 1749, Élisabeth and her retinue of Spanish and French courtiers arrived in the Duchy of Parma, where they were welcomed by Philip and greeted by public celebrations in her honor. In Parma, she and her Philip lived in the Ducal Palace of Colorno. Before the former duke, Philip' brother Charles, had left to become king of Naples, he had reportedly stripped the palace of much of its interior decoration and furniture, and the residence also lacked a garden. Élisabeth spent great sums to create a residence and a court to her taste; the whole arrangement and plan of the residence was redesigned, and she organised court ceremonies and hosted numerous festivities such as opera six times a week and trips to the second residence in Colonna and Piacenza. To enforce the status of the Duchy, she also introduced the presence of a regiment of one hundred carbineers and a regiment of curassiers, despite the fact that the Duchy was formally under the protection of France and Spain. As duchess of Parma, Élisabeth was actively involved in state affairs; Philip never negotiated any business without consulting her, and she in turn never made a decision without considering the view of France and her French advisers. Most of the officials of the court and government were French, and French was the language spoken at court, even by Philip, while she herself demonstratively promoted French influence. French influence in Parma was not popular; public opinion raged against both French and Spanish rulers. In 1750, Elisabeth's lady-in-waiting Madame de Leydc was rumored to have poisoned France's Chief Minister at Parma, supposedly for being French. The financial stress of the duchy was extensive, which created a problem. Élisabeth's twin sister Henriette died in 1752, and Élisabeth returned to France in September, visiting her tomb at Saint-Denis and remaining in Versailles for almost a year. She brought with her the duke de Noailles, who assisted her in the political transactions she held with her father during her stay, helping her to navigate between the party fractions at court. Élisabeth presented Louis XV and his ministers with a report of the state of Parma, stressing its financial need. The duke de Noailles was sent to the French ambassador in Madrid to open negotiations between France and Spain regarding the contributions of the Duchy of Parma in January 1753, in which Élisabeth participated with all her contacts in France and Spain, supporting the French suggestion that France and Spain would share the expenses of the Duchy of Parma if the latter could guarantee her independence. By the Franco-Spanish agreement of 1753, the Duchy of Parma was granted twenty five thousand francs, two millions in taxes and supplementary assistance when needed, in addition to making French influence in Parma formal and officially legal. Elisabeth was hailed and praised in France for securing the French influence abroad by this agreement, in which she had played a vital part.

Élisabeth returned to Parma in October 1753. Upon her return, she appointed Guillaume du Tillot as chief minister and administrator of the principality, securing both her own pro-French policy as well as marking France's de facto conquest of Parma. In her policy, Élisabeth worked to free Parma from Spanish influence; to secure the succession of the duchy for her son and if possibly obtain a greater throne for him with French help; and to secure dynastic marriages for her daughters. In accordance with her ambitions, she viewed Spain as her enemy and therefore supported the Treaty of Versailles of 1756, which allied France with Austria. In the Treaty, it had been suggested that Austria would cede the Austrian Netherlands as a kingdom for Philip, which would be even more favorable for France than to have Parma as a vassal, a plan which was supported by both Elisabeth and Louis XV. In this plan, she worked together with Madame de Pompadour to secure the Franco- Austrian alliance, and they also joined in their support of Choiseul. Élisabeth returned to France again in September 1757 to attend the negotiations between France and Austria. She supported Austria's wish to make the Austrian Netherlands a Kingdom for Philip in exchange for retrieving Silesia from Prussia with the support of France, as it would mean a final independence of Spain, but was not successful. In the treaty between Spain and Austria on the 3 of October 1759, supported by Choiseul, the right of Philip in the Treaty of 1748 to succeed to the throne of Naples and Sicily should his brother Charles inherit the throne of Spain, was a great disappointment to her. During her stay in France, she kept in contact with Philip by letter and informed him of her acts, negotiations, hopes and successes, as well as the intentions and actions of Louis’ Government. During this time, Elisabeth also appointed the philosopher Condillac as her son's tutor despite opposition from the Jesuits, and arranged the marriage of her daughter Isabella to the Archduke Joseph of Austria, which took place in 1760. Élisabeth fell ill while she was at Versailles, and died of smallpox on 6 December 1759 and was buried on 27 March 1760 at Saint-Denis Basilica beside her twin, Henriette. Their tombs were desecrated in 1793 during the French Revolution.

Rainforest Conservation Movement of Assam and the Declaration of Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary  Nature's Beckon rediscovered and highlighted the presence of contiguous rain forests in the Dibrugarh-Tinsukia districts of Upper Assam and undertook a movement for the legal protection of a 500 sq.km of contiguous rainforest. This movement started with baseline surveys of the region by the organization and activism of various forms at multistructural levels. This is the most famous conservation movement in the region and was in fact the first ever rainforest movement in Assam. The conservation movement taken by Nature's Beckon forced the state government in 13 June 2004 to declare 111.19 sq.km of rainforest as 'Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary.' This was another and a major success story in the conservation history of India. This achievement of the group involved almost a decade long struggle (1995–2004) of the activists associated with it. However, the group considered this achievement only as the partial fulfillment of its objectives and claims that the connected rain forests area of Dibrugarh and Tinsukia district are occupying around 500 sq km, which constitute the only surviving largest in separate‘ forest areas of the of the Brahmaputra valley. The organization still demands and works for the area extension of the Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary,saying that the Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary should constitute the entire contiguous rain forest.

The story, screenplay, dialogues, lyrics, music and direction were by Joe Stanley. The movie stars newcomer Sam Anderson, alongside newcomers Jothi and Varnika. Plot The story opens as Deepa (Varnika), a medical college student, sings a song during the cultural festival. She is being surrounded by lush green fields and mountains but the college, or even the stage for that matter, is nowhere in sight. The next scene shifts to three robbers, ogling at Deepa. She is on her way to sit for her college examinations. But while wheeling her punctured scooter (Scooty), the robbers snatch her chain and escape on a bike. In comes hero David (Sam Anderson) on a scooter (Kinetic Honda) who does a chase after them. He returns empty-handed and recognizes Deepa from the college function earlier. He praises her amazing vocal skills and gives his gold crucifix chain as a gift. Deepa refuses, but David then gives a sermon about Hindu-Christian difference. Yet, she still does not accept it. David also gives his 'stepnee' (spare) tyre to Deepa (God knows how a Kinetic Honda spare wheel could fit into a Scooty Pep's wheel drum). This incident is one of the most important scenes in the movie. The next day, David goes to Deepa's house. He overhears Deepa singing a devotional song and stands mesmerized by her voice. He asks Deepa to return his tyre. Deepa informs him that her scooter has been sent for service. David also impresses her mother with his gentlemanly manners which clearly failed to impress the audiences. The scene then shifts to David's confrontation with the robbers who also happen to be the accomplices of his father's best friend (Venniradai Moorthy). David starts a sermon about the greatness of the crucifix and gives it to the robbers for cleansing their sins. The robbers have a dramatic change of heart and praise David as their saviour. They also give back the chain they stole from Deepa during the beginning of the film. Deepa learns that David is an automobile engineer and visits his workshop, and sees \\"high-end models\\" specifically designed by David. David then returns Deepa's chain that he had got from the robbers. He also presents the crucifix along with her chain. David and Deepa then fall in love. Deepa's mother is concerned that her daughter might be tricked into love by David. Deepa consoles her and praises David's manners. Meanwhile, the robbers turn over a new leaf and begin to work in David's workshop. The mechanics then prod David to tell them about his affair with Deepa. David blushes. As luck would have it, Deepa's father is a car showroom owner. Deepa takes David to her father the next day. David then proposes his idea, but Deepa's father scoffs at it, leaving David heart- broken. David then requests for a car poster (which is of a Ferrari F50) that is posted on the office wall. Deepa's father tells him it is the new customer car that is to be sold in the (Hyundai?)showroom and refuses. David then leaves the office, dejected. Deepa gets at angry at her father for his treatment of David and rushes out to console him. The next scene shows David back in his workshop with his mechanics. They console him and make a plan to ask for a loan from the moneylender (Venniradai Moorthy). Meanwhile, Deepa's father expresses his fear to his wife about Deepa falling in love with David. The next day, David goes to the moneylender's house along with his faithful mechanics to ask for a loan. Moorthy also promises to help him out by agreeing to fund for two of his model cars. David and Deepa then meet at a beach and break into a song (Raasathi)where David's luscious shoulder movements really captivated the audience. Deepa's looks were equally as good as David's dancing. The next day, Moorthy visits David's workshop but upon seeing the reality, changes his mind and refuses to lend money to David. David is heartbroken but Deepa visits him and consoles him. She presents the Ferrari poster to him and asks him to marry her. She also plans to use her 500,000 rupees (that happens to be her inheritance) to help David out. Soon, David's birthday comes up and Deepa plans a big surprise for him. But everyone is in for a huge surprise as Manju (Jothi), comes from Canada to visit David. She sees David cutting the cake alone and joins him. David is happy to see her and says, \\"My God, how beautiful you are!\\". We learn that Manju was David's sweetheart during their college days but had a fall-out because Manju went to Canada to pursue her career. She also says that she came back to India to take David with her to Canada. David then has a duet sequence with Manju for some unexplained reasons. Deepa suddenly enters the room and gets angry at David for flirting with another woman. She leaves the room fuming. David tries to stop her but she doesn't listen. At this point in the film, most of the audience would've concluded that both girls would've been wooed by David's talent in dancing. Manju takes David out for lunch and learns about his life after college and his new love Deepa. She gets angry at him for not treating Deepa properly. But she also feels sorry for him and soon falls prey to his (charms?). The Raasathi song is shown again but this time with Manju instead of Deepa. Manju asks David to marry her and plans their migration to Canada. She then asks David to forget Deepa and give back her 500,000 rupees. David then asks for advice from his faithful sidekicks. He then visits Deepa surrounded by a stunning landscape and asks for her forgiveness. Deepa gets angry with his behaviour and scorns at him. Wounded, David comes back to his sidekicks who advise him to jump for Manju instead. David then goes to Manju seeking refuge. Manju initially gets angry that David had not returned the check but then suddenly declares her love for him and starts yet another duet sequence. David and Manju stop their car in No-Man's Land and plan to go to the airport from there. Out of nowhere, Deepa suddenly appears there on her Scooty. This is the film's climax. Deepa accuses David that he used her just like the stepnee tyre that was shown in the beginning. David then explains that he never used her but always thought of her as his stepping stone to success (Vazhkaiyil Ovvoru Steppum Nee, Steppu Nee, Steppu Nee, Steppu Nee). Deepa refuses to be consoled and gives back the gold crucifix chain to David. She then leaves the place with sorrow. Manju gets angry with David again. She asks David to give the chain to whomever he likes. David then puts the chain around Manju's neck. Manju takes it as the holy thaali, and says that she is now all his. David and Manju circle the car by which they came, three times. This scene symbolically indicates that the marriage of David and Manju has been made in heaven, marked by the circling of the holy fire thrice in actual marriages. The next scene shows a (Cargo) aeroplane taking off, presumably with David and Manju inside it, for Canada. Cast * Sam Anderson as David.

Agencies and Personnel  FEMA - 3634 - Photograph by Leif Skoogfors taken on 07-21-2001 in West Virginia Humane law enforcement officers (oftentimes abbreviated as \\"HLEOs\\" in some jurisdictions) are generally members of a state or local society for the prevention of cruelty to animals (SPCA) or a state or local police department and as such are generally trained and certified alongside other police and law enforcement officers at a state or local police training academy. Depending on the jurisdiction, HLEOs may also be sworn and/or commissioned officers with peace officer status, empowered with the appropriate law enforcement authority to effect arrests with or without warrant, sign complaints and issue court summonses, conduct searches and seizures, and carry weapons including a firearm, especially if trained and certified through a police training academy.http://criminologycareers.about.com/od/Law-Enforcement- Careers/a/Career-Profile-Animal-Cop.htm Humane law enforcement may be performed by government agencies, private agencies, or both, depending on the jurisdiction. Individuals who perform humane law enforcement duties include police officers, humane law enforcement officers, animal control officers, and animal cruelty investigators. There are many different agencies that are involved in humane law enforcement including private and public. One of the better known private agencies is the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.http://www.aspca.org/fight-cruelty Other agencies include the Humane Society of the United States as well as state police departments. Although all the states do not have a specific humane law enforcement section of their police department, all of them do in one way or another take care of the responsibilities that humane officers would do.  Duties  malnourished horse The duties of humane law enforcement personnel also depend on the jurisdiction. Their duties may include performing routine patrol to look out for violations of humane laws, answering complaints relating to violations of humane laws, making arrests or issuing summonses for violations of humane laws, and seizing animals due to violations of humane laws. They may also perform undercover work. Although some of the duties may differ slightly between different jurisdictions and agencies, for the most part many of the responsibilities will be the same. According to criminologycareers.com, humane law enforcement officers are responsible for \\"Investigating animal abuse cases, Enforcing laws related to the care and keeping of animals, Regulating industries that work with and use animals, Writing reports, Preparing and executing warrants, Arresting suspected criminals, Issuing civil fines, Responding to calls for service.\\"http://criminologycareers.about.com/od/Law- Enforcement-Careers/a/Career-Profile-Animal-Cop.htm These duties are performed by all humane enforcement agencies while others may differ slightly depending on the location of the agency. For example, a humane law officer in New York City would most likely not be dealing with bear baiting offenders like officers in South Carolina do.http://www.dnr.sc.gov/news/yr2014/feb27/feb27_humane.html Education and Training Hinged Handcuffs Rear Back To Back Anywhere that you may go seeking employment to become a humane law enforcer, will at the very least require a high school diploma or GED in order to get the job. A great majority of the agencies and departments will also require previous experience working with animals. If you are hoping to become a humane officer through a police department, you will also have to go through the police academy because humane officers are fully empowered police officers. On top of these requirements, in order to put yourself ahead of the competition, you may want to look into secondary training. \\"Individuals interested in becoming humane society police officers may obtain training through state humane society associations, national animal control associations, community colleges or technical schools.\\"http://study.com/articles/How_to_Become_a_Humane_Society_Police_Officer.html Secondary training along with previous experience working with animals is helpful because you would be working with sick/injured animals and need to know how to properly handle and care for them. Other Requirements If you acquire an interview to become a humane law enforcement officer, your interviewer will be looking for key personality traits and characteristics to set you aside from the other interviewees and show that you are mentally capable of performing the necessary duties. According to study.com, a person needs to exhibit these traits, \\"Active listening, critical thinking, good judgment and decision-making, strong public speaking skills, ability to cope with high-stress situations involving animals and their owner\\" in order to perform well. Criminologycareers.com emphasizes these characteristics along with compassion and understanding as \\"absolute must-have abilities in order to stay safe on the job.\\" The reasons why these traits are so important is because, just like with any typical police duty, you never know how the perpetrator will react. Plus people can be especially emotional when it comes to their animals because they may have a strong connection to the animal.

Their names are tagged together as \\"Jamali Kamali\\" for the mosque as well as the tomb since they are buried adjacent to each other. The mosque and the tomb were constructed in 1528-1529, and Jamali was buried in the tomb after his death in 1535. Location Mehrauli urban village where the monument is located is approachable from all parts of Delhi by well laid out roads and transport system. The Indira Gandhi International Airport is away and the New Delhi Railway Station and Nizamuddin Railway Station are respectively , and away. Visitors are free to visit the monument on all week days. The nearest metro station is Qutab Minar, which is within walking distance from the mosque. The practice of Friday prayers is barred in such monuments classified by the body under the category of \\"non-living heritage structures\\". History \\"Jamali\\" was the alias given to Shaikh Fazlu'llah, also known as Shaikh Jamali Kamboh or Jalal Khan, a renowned Sufi saint who lived during Lodi Dynasty and the Mughal Dynasty, a period from the rule of Sikander Lodi to that of Babur and Humayun. The name \\"Jamali\\" is Urdu, though originates from \\"Jamal\\" which means \\"beauty\\". Jamali was a popular poet who traveled widely around Asia and the Middle East. He became court poet during Lodi Dynasty rule and continued to enjoy the patronage of the Mughal rulers, Babur and his son Humayun. His poetry mirrored Persian mysticism of the times. His two popular works are The Sun and Moon and The Spiritual Journey of the Mystics. It is said that his tomb was completed during Humayun's rule. Kamali was an unknown person who was Jamali's disciple and his lover, according to the oral stories and traditions. It is noted that even though they were both males, as signified by a symbolic pen box on each of their graves, their graves are placed in a manner that implies that they were lovers. Mythology The fakirs call upon Jinns on every Thursday as the place is believed to be haunted. People have noted to have been slapped by invisible forces and have heard various voices coming from adjoining graves. The Paranormal Society of India stated that their instruments picked up \\"certain vibrations\\" at the site. Architecture Mosque The entrance gate to the Mosque from southern side arcade around the Mosque The Jamali Kamali mosque, positioned in an enclosed garden area, built first during the years 1528-29, has a southern entry. It is built in red sandstone with marble embellishments. It is claimed to be a forerunner in the design of Mughal mosque architecture in India. The prayer hall, fronted by a large courtyard, has five arches with the central arch only having a dome. The size of arches increases towards the central arch, which is the largest of the five arches embellished with beautiful ornamentation. The spandrels of the arch are decorated with medallions and ornamentation. Fluted pilasters exquisitely decorate the central arch. The prayer wall on the west has niches with mihrab. The niches and walls are decorated with a few Koranic inscriptions. A porch around the mosque provides access to the two storied mosque and the four corners are adorned by octagonal towers. The rear end of the mosque has been provided with oriel windows, apart from a small window on the central arch. Tomb Interior decoration on the roof of tomb of Jamali Kamali, Mehrauli Archeological Park, Delhi The tomb of Jamali-Kamali is a decorated square structure with a flat roof, located adjacent to the mosque on its northern side. Inside the chamber, the flat ceiling is plastered and ornately decorated. It is painted in red and blue with some Koranic inscriptions, and the walls are adorned with inlaid coloured tiles inscribed with Jamali's poems. The decorations in the tomb have been described as giving the impression of \\"stepping into a jewel box\\". In the Jamali Kamali Mosque and Tomb the tomb chamber has two marble graves: one of Jamali, the saint poet and the other of Kamali. The reason for the Kamali name could probably be that it rhymes well with Jamali. Conservation The monument is well maintained and provides a very serene atmosphere. Conservation of the monuments has been undertaken by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to further spruce it up before the 2010 Commonwealth Games to be held in Delhi. It is one of the 172 monuments under the jurisdiction of the Delhi Archaeological circle, of ASI, identified for restoration. An amount of Rs. 1.5 million (US$30,000) has been proposed for this purpose. Gallery File:Jamali Kamali Masjid, Mehrauli.jpg|Another view of the Mosque.

It covers an area of and is between the fishing town of Peniche, in Oeste Subregion, to the south and Obidos Lagoon to its north. The view from Praia d'El Rey of the beach and ocean in front of it. The first properties built within the site in the late 1990s were near to its gated entrance, followed later by a Marriott Hotel and several hundred more private villas, townhouses and apartments - which are owned mostly by Irish, British and Scandinavian nationals. Properties within the resort are usually either second/holiday homes or lived in year-round by retirees. In 1997 a links golf course was opened on the site designed by Cabell B. Robinson, an American golf course architect. This championship course is 6,625 metres long and a par 73 and is considered by many golfers to one of the more challenging courses in Portugal being both a links course when next to the beach, but also travels through wooded areas and is overlooked by houses. Praia d'El Rey, which recently won a travel award, is also a beach resort and residents and visitors are able to gain access to the area's beach.  Marriott Hotel  One of the sea-view suites at the Praia d'El Rey Marriott Hotel The Praia d'El Rey Golf and Beach Resort includes a five-star Marriott hotel at the centre of the resort which has 179 rooms plus three bars and three restaurants. There is also a main outdoor swimming pool and an indoor pool and spa/gym plus meeting rooms, a large entry vestibule and beach side facilities. The hotel, which at the moment is believed to be the only five- star hotel on Portugal's western coastline, is regularly used by Portugal's national football team, whose players and managers both stay at the hotel and use the resort's UEFA-standard football pitches to practice on—often in the days before a big home match.  Property  As well as the resort's hotel and golf facilities there are also approximately 800 properties within the site which are all privately owned. These have been built over the past decade as the resort has expanded and work continues to build more in at least three areas. Existing properties can be purchased as resales, off-plan and newly built and include villas, townhouses and apartments.  Sports facilities  As well as its championship golf course, Praia d'El Rey Golf and Beach Resort includes a practice range, UEFA-standard football pitches and seven tennis courts. Visitors and residents are also able to mountain bike, horse ride and surf in the area. The resort's beach is open to the general public and there are several surf spots directly opposite the Beachfront Apartments complex.  Location and history  Praia d'El Rey is in the Vale de Janelas (Windows Valley), also known locally as the Sítio dos Belgas (Small farm of the Belgians). The resort takes its name from the Serra d'El-Rei (King's Mountain Range) where Peter I of Portugal had a castle where he used to meet his mistress Dona Inês. This history is reflected in the resort's streets names. The main street is called Avenida D. Pedro and an adjoining street is called Avenida Dona Inês de Castro. The site was bought by a group of Dutch investors who formed the Beltico Group in the late 1960s to develop commercial residential and tourism projects in the UK, Portugal and Brazil, and construction began at Praia d'El Rey in the late 1990s, including the first properties and facilities on-site. But, after a period, the majority shareholding in Beltico was sold by the original investors to a new, largely British-owned consortium. Beltico has completed residential and commercial construction projects in the UK, runs a specialist residential development firm called Qube, is building three resorts similar to Praia d'El Rey in Brazil, owns Portugal's largest golf course construction company, and has interests in construction, oil and gas production and residential real estate in the UK, Portugal and elsewhere.

A talented fielder and right-handed batsman,Lillywhite p. 64. popularly known as Kerr, Coward played 49 first-class matches for Lancashire County Cricket Club between 1865 and 1876. He scored 1,210 runs in the middle order for Lancashire, before retiring to play club cricket for his home town of Preston – who he also coached – as well as becoming a cricket umpire for 98 matches, a licensed victualler and a teacher at the Roman Catholic institutions of Stonyhurst College in Lancashire and Clongowes Wood College in Ireland. Cricket career Early days Coward was born in Preston, Lancashire. On 26 May 1862, aged 24, Coward appeared for All England Eleven – a team of hitherto untested cricketers who had not played professional cricket before – at Lord's against a 20-man-Yorkshire team. Coward was dismissed for a duck by William Iddison; took two catches to dismiss Joseph Thewlis off the bowling of George Tarrant and John Thewlis off the bowling of Edgar Willsher; and then scored a second duck to end the match with a pair. He then played a second match in June 1862, for a team of professionals against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's, where he scored another duck in the first innings, and then top-scored with 17 in the second innings, earning a presentation bat from the Hon. F. Ponsonby. He then played four matches between 1863 and 1864 for two Lancashire teams – Gentlemen of Lancashire and Players of Lancashire – against similar Shropshire, Warwickshire and Yorkshire. On 25 May 1865, he played a three-day match against the United South of England Eleven for a 22-strong Pleasington. Coward scored four and 25 as Pleasington fell to a 12-run defeat. His skills with the bat, \\"reckoned to be an excellent batsman and a good field at long-leg or cover-point,\\" attracted the attention of Lancashire. First-class cricket Coward made his debut for Lancashire on 7 August 1865, against Middlesex in a cricket ground at Islington. Middlesex won the toss and batted first, reaching 226 and dismissing Lancashire for 112 with Coward making 23. Following on, Coward was run out for a duck, with Lancashire's 130 all out leaving Middlesex only 17 to win, which they reached without losing a wicket, and with a day still remaining in the game. Coward did not play another match in the 1865 season, however he became a more regular fixture in the 1866 season, with five appearances for his county. He scored 183 runs at 20.33, including his career-best 85. This score came in a 5 July 1866 match at Old Trafford, where Coward came in to bat with Lancashire on 48/6. He took Lancashire to 181 before becoming the last wicket to fall. He scored four more in the second innings, but could not prevent a 54-run defeat by Middlesex. His abilities with the bat earned him places in the United All England Eleven sides as well as both Gentlemen and Players' teams. He would go on to score 81 runs from three matches for the United All England Eleven side. Coward enjoyed regular first-class appearances during the next two seasons – 1867 and 1868 – making ten appearances in both. He scored 285 runs in 1867, another career best, at 16.76 with a high score of 34; and he scored 267 runs in 1868 at 14.05 – which included more matches for North of England Eleven – with a best of 46.Sissons, p. 63. He also took six catches in the field. Coward made eight other appearances in 1869, scoring 165 runs at 15.00. On 27 May 1869, Lancashire faced Surrey, where Coward scored his season-best of 49, followed by 16*. He also faced the MCC on 19 July, where Coward scored five in the first innings, and 15 in the second before he was bowled by WG Grace. Coward also played two All England Eleven matches against Worksop and Northamptonshire, scored five, three, 15 and 18; and in the latter match her took four catches. Umpiring Coward was reduced to two appearances in 1870, first against Surrey where he scored one and two not out, and the second for United North of England Eleven first against United South of England Eleven. Instead, Coward undertook first-class cricket umpiring, with his first match taking place on 21 July between Lancashire and Hampshire. Coward went on to umpire 98 first-class matches, and 19 other matches. Coward continued to umpire cricket matches while he played more occasionally for Lancashire. Coward played six matches in 1871, scoring 162 runs at 16.20; and three further matches in 1872 which returned only 33 runs at 6.60. His umpiring then tapered off, and would not resume to any great extent until the 1880s. He would also not play first-class cricket between 1872 and 1875, with an appearance on 27 August 1874 for United North of England Eleven against Northamptonshire being his only cricket appearance. He returned in 1875 for three matches, scoring only 54 runs at 10.80, and one final match in 1876 where he failed to score a run. This would be his last appearance as a player in any first-class-matches, and he resumed umpiring briefly from 1876 to 1879, before becoming a regular umpire from 1880 until 1893. He had a benefit match between Lancashire and Nottinghamshire at Old Trafford in July 1878. In 1889, Coward also had a benefit match between Lancashire and an 18-man team from Preston Cricket Club. Coward's final match as an umpire, saw Surrey face Gloucestershire at the Kennington Oval on 1 June 1893. During it, Coward oversaw WG Grace passing 38500 first-class runs in partnership with fellow, and international Test umpire, C Clements. Later life In 1881, a local census recorded Coward living at Riverside Bowling Green Inn, Preston, with his wife Ellen, aged 41. He had two domestic servants and, at age 43, was a licensed victualler. The 1901 census listed him as a professional cricketer, however his wife had by then died, and Coward was shown to live at 204 South Meadow Road, Preston with one servant. In his last years he continued to play club cricket for Preston, and spent some time at Stonyhurst College, Lancashire and at Clongowes Wood College, in Ireland. He died in July 1903, in the town of his birth, Preston. His younger brother, Frederick, also played first-class cricket.

Discovery of the body Yallop’s murder theory requires that the pope’s body be found at 4:30 or 4:45 a.m., one hour earlier than official reports estimated. He bases this on an early story by the Italian news service ANSA that garbled the time and misrepresented the layout of the papal apartments. Yallop also claims to have had testimony from Sister Vincenza to this effect but refused to show Cornwell his transcripts. Both papal secretaries and a confidante of the late Sister Vincenza insist that the body was discovered about 5:30 a.m. The nun noticed that the coffee she had left outside the pope’s bedroom door a few minutes earlier, as per his morning routine, had not been touched. She went through two sets of doors and parted a curtain to find John Paul dead on his bed with a light on and reading material in his hands. Magee was summoned first, then Lorenzi. They found rigor mortis already beginning to set in and tore the Pope’s cassock while preparing his private laying-out. This supports the official estimate for time of death as 11 p.m. the previous evening. Secret autopsy Yallop suggests that a real sealing-off of the Pope's corpse from public gaze was performed to allow a “secret” autopsy. Cornwell claims that he refers to a simple cosmetic retouching of the corpse. A major source of suspicion for Yallop was the lack of a publicly issued death certificate, which he claimed showed either official reticency in assigning a cause of death, or an outright lack of medical authority for the \\"heart attack\\" claim. Cornwell was given access to the death certificate, and reproduces it. Yallop also relates (without endorsing) a claim that the undertakers were summoned at 5 a.m. before the official finding of the body, but this is based on an incorrect news story taken from garbled secondhand information. The Vatican carpool log shows the embalmers were sent for at 5:15 p.m. The procedure began about 7 p.m. Cardinal Villot Yallop questions the disappearance of incriminating personal effects, supposedly removed by Cardinal Villot. He thinks John Paul’s slippers and glasses might have been stained with vomit caused by the digitalis poisoning. But Cornwell finds that the Pope's sister took them. His last will was a brief document bequeathing his goods to a Venetian convent. Yallop's one damning datum was a Swiss Guard’s observation of Paul Marcinkus walking near the papal residence at an unusually early hour on the morning of the Pope’s death. But the guardsman, Hans Roggen, told Cornwell that his testimony was taken deceptively and misrepresented. Marcinkus was a demonstrably early riser and had driven in at his usual time. Pulmonary embolism Cornwell's research suggests that Luciani had indeed been in poor health, in which claim he is supported to an extent by the late Pope's niece Pia, herself a doctor, and anecdotally by many senior but medically inexpert Vatican figures. His niece, Pia, suggested that Luciani suffered from swollen ankles and feet (a sign of poor circulation and excessive coagulability of the blood) such that he could not wear the shoes purchased for him at the time of his election. These conditions were also noted by Yallop, who talked with the Pope's doctor and found the swollen ankles a sign of low blood pressure. The Pope did not drink, had never smoked and ate sparingly. Cornwell concluded that John Paul I died of a pulmonary embolism (which was supported by the fact that he had experienced a retinal embolism in 1976). Cornwell suggested that John Paul died at about 9.30 p.m., perhaps 10.00 p.m., at his desk and was found on the floor by the priest secretaries. These moved the body into the bed and placed it in what is truly an unusual position for a person who has died suddenly (sitting up, eyeglasses in place and papers in hand), with no indication whatsoever that he was experiencing a fatal attack. Lying next to the Pope was a report on the Jesuit Order that had just been completed, but history is unclear as to whether John Paul had just finished reading the report or had in fact been writing it. Covering up health problems Cornwell's rationale is that by moving the Pope's corpse, the two secretaries were trying to disguise the late Pope's supposed health problems. Cornwell claims that the Pope had suffered two episodes of acute chest pain that are consistent with a diagnosis of an imminent pulmonary embolism, as well as a severe coughing fit. The two secretaries had suggested that in both cases of chest pain the Pope's doctors should be summoned, but the Pope had brushed them off. Cornwell claims that guilt drove them to want to make his death look sudden so that no blame would fall on them. Both secretaries (one, John Magee, is the retired Irish Catholic bishop of Cloyne) deny Cornwell's claims. Cornwell's theory is held to explain strange comments by both men; Magee reportedly talked on the night of the Pope's death to the nuns in the Papal Household about the possibility of the Pope's death \\"that night\\". Algor mortis The other secretary reportedly spoke of the pope's back and feet still being warm when he lifted him. Even if the Pope had died in bed, Cornwell believes algor mortis would mean his corpse would have been externally cold by the time he was found (around 5.30 a.m., by which time rigor mortis had set in). There is dispute over this suggestion, since Cornwell also claims that the summer of 1978 saw a high air temperature in Rome that was behind the decision to embalm the Pope as soon as possible (see above). Cornwell's conclusion of rigor mortis onset also contradicts his conclusion that the Pope's corpse was manipulated into position (sitting up in bed, holding papers) after discovery.

The area was listed as a national historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. History Originally began in 1918 in order to house steel workers for the increased demand of steel in World War I. The number of houses needed was overestimated and the United States Housing Corporation gave up on the project. By 1941, the Pembroke project was finished and contained 202 units of low-income public housing and it was the first such project in the city. By the early 1950s, the Bethlehem Housing Authority purchased additional adjoining lands, including an farm to build additional affordable housing in the area. Between 1952 and 1962, the Authority built 570 units, which included Marvine Village (400 units), Fairmount Homes (120) and Pfeifle Homes (50). These three developments added to Pembroke created one large community collectively known as the Northeast Developments. Over the years, the buildings have undergone many millions of dollars in renovations. Pembroke was renovated in the 1990s, Fairmount and Marvine twice each since the 1980s. Comprehensive renovations were recently completed at Pfeifle Homes. Presently, 20 new homes are being built in the area near Fairmount, to be called Bayard Homes. They add to BHA's inventory and guarantee that 5% of all BHA units are handicap-accessible. Emergency services Police service Thanks to a long-term agreement between the housing authority and the City of Bethlehem, community policing substations are a part of BHA properties, including the Marvine-Pembroke area. The community police concept is funded by BHA on an annual basis and in return, the BPD provides above baseline services for the community. Demographics The population breakdown in Pembroke is roughly 70% Hispanic, with remaining people being either Caucasian or African American. As is the case with all low-income public housing, the community is made up of families, some seniors and some who are disabled. Gang Activity Like many Pennsylvania communities, the Lehigh Valley has seen an influx of gangs from larger urban areas. It is thought that the completion of Interstate 78 in 1990 has contributed to this phenomenon. Despite this, official gang activities are limited in Bethlehem as evidenced by FBI crime statistics.

Many buildings, structures and historical monuments remain from the colonial era. Mumbai, after Miami, has the second largest number of Art Deco buildings in the world. Styles Victorian Gothic architecture Mumbai Architecture came to be present through the British in the 18th and early 19th centuries. At first it was the neoclassical style of architecture but later, the Victorian Gothic style (also known as Gothic revival) came to dominate the city. Where the neoclassical has an orderly monochromatic presence, the Gothic style is expressive, disjointed with surfaces of lives colors, beautified with carved and narrative elements, consisting of flying buttresses, lancet windows and stained glass. At first, due to the immense freed space it obtained, Gothic building only served as churches, as religious buildings built by people of the 11th century. However, soon enough there came a need for public halls, parliament houses, mansions, and the Gothic era was the solution. Indian architects came to analyze this style and represent it and put it into play in relation with the climate, and in relation to society's plans and sensibilities. This style, the blend of Gothic and contemporary styles, is what came to be known as \\"Mumbai Gothic.\\" According to writer Jan Morris, \\"Mumbai is one of the most characteristically Victorian cities in the world, displaying all the grand effrontery of Victorian eclecticism\\". The British influence on buildings in the city is evident from the colonial era. However, the architectural features include a range of European influences such as German gables, Dutch roofs, Swiss timbering, Romance arches and Tudor casements often inter-fused with traditional Indian features. Mumbai City Hall was built during the period 1820 and 1835, by Colonel Thomas Cowper. The Fort campus of the University of Mumbai and Rajabai Tower, Saint Xavier's College, The Secretariat, Telegraph Office, Wilson College, and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus are also fine examples of gothic architecture in the city.  Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus  Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus is a historic terminal train station and UNESCO World Heritage Site in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. The terminus was designed by British architectural engineer Frederick William Stevens in the style of Victorian Italianate Gothic Revival architecture. Its construction began in 1878, in a location south of the old Bori Bunder railway station, and was completed in 1887, the year marking 50 years of Queen Victoria's rule, the building being named, Victoria Terminus. The station's name was changed to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (station code CST) in March 1996 to honour Shivaji, the 17th-century founder of the Maratha Empire, whose name is often preceded by Chhatrapati, a royal title. In 2017, the station was again renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (code CSTM), where Maharaj is also a royal title. However, both the former initials \\"VT\\" and the current, \\"CST\\", are commonly used. The terminus is the headquarters of India's Central Railway. It is one of the busiest railway stations in India, serving as a terminal for both long-distance- and suburban trains. The railway station was built to replace the Bori Bunder railway station, in the Bori Bunder area of Mumbai, a prominent port and warehouse area known for its imports and exports. Since Mumbai became a major port city at the time, a bigger station was built to meet its demands, and was named Victoria Terminus, after the then reigning Empress of India, Queen Victoria. The station was designed by the consulting British architect Frederick William Stevens. Work began in 1878. He received ₹1,614,000 (US$23,000) as the payment for his services. Stevens earned the commission to construct the station after a masterpiece watercolour sketch by draughtsman Axel Haig. The final design bears some resemblance to St Pancras railway station in London. GG Scott's plans for Berlin's parliament building had been published four years before, and also has marked similarities to the station's design. The station took ten years to complete, the longest for any building of that era in Bombay. This famous architectural landmark in a Gothic-revival style was built as the headquarters of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway. The station building is designed in the High Victorian Gothic style of architecture. The building exhibits a fusion of influences from Victorian Italianate Gothic Revival architecture and classical Indian architecture. The skyline, turrets, pointed arches, and eccentric ground plan are close to classical Indian palace architecture. Fort campus of the University of Mumbai The Rajabai Tower in South Mumbai is located in the confines of the Fort campus of the University of Mumbai, and was constructed between 1869 and 1878. It was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott, an English architect, and was modeled on Big Ben, the clock tower of the United Kingdom's houses of Parliament in London. The tower stands at a height of 85 m (280 ft) and at the time it was the tallest building in India. The tower fuses Venetian and Gothic styles. It is built out of the locally available buff coloured Kurla stone and stained glass. A file photo of University of Mumbai taken in the 1870s. Rajabai Clock Tower here seen shrouded in scaffolding was completed in 1878 The ground floor has two side rooms, each measuring 56 × 27.5 ft (17 × 8.5 m). The tower forms a carriage porch 2.4 m (26 ft), and a spiral staircase vestibule of 2.6 m (28 ft). The Tower, over the carriage porch, has a square form up to the gallery at the top of the first level which is at a height of 68 feet (20.7 m) from the ground. The form changes from a square to an octagon and the height from this gallery to the top of the tower is 118 feet (36 m) and the third stage to the top of the finial is 94 feet (28.7 m), thus making a total height of .  Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Market  Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Mandai(formally Crawford Market) in south Mumbai was named after Arthur Crawford, the first Municipal Commissioner of the city. The building, completed in 1869, was donated to the city by Cowasji Jehangir. In 1882, the building was the first market in India to be lit up by electricity. The edifice is a blend of Norman, Flemish and Gothic architectural styles. The friezes on the outside entrance depicting Indian farmers, and the stone fountains inside, were designed by Lockwood Kipling, father of novelist Rudyard Kipling. The market covers an area of 22,471 sq m (24,000 sq ft) which 5,515 sq m (6,000 sq ft) is occupied by the building itself. The structure was built using coarse buff coloured Kurla stone, with redstone from Vasai.  Watson's Hotel  Watson's Hotel Watson's Hotel, currently known as the Esplanade Mansion, is located in the Kala Ghoda area of Mumbai and is India's oldest surviving cast iron building. It was named after its original owner John Watson and designed by civil engineer Rowland Mason Ordish, who was also associated with the St Pancras Station in London. The building was fabricated in England between 1867 and 1869 from cast iron components and was assembled and constructed on site. The external cast-iron frame closely resembles other high-profile 19th century buildings such as London's Crystal Palace. The main façade of the hotel is distinguished by wide, open balconies on each floor that connected the guest rooms, which were built around the atrium in a courtyard arrangement. Neglect of the building has resulted in decay and, despite its listing as a Grade II–A heritage structure, the building is now in a dilapidated state. The condition of the building was publicized by Italian architect Renzo Piano and heritage activists, and as a result of their efforts, the building was listed in June 2005 on the list of \\"100 World Endangered Monuments\\" by the World Monuments Fund, a New York-based NGO. Indo-Saracenic The Indo-Saracenic style developed in the second half of the 19th century, combining Islamic and Hindu architectural styles with its characteristic domes, arches, stained glasses, spires, and minarets. The Gateway of India and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya are good examples of this architectural type in the city. Gateway of India The Gateway of India is one of the major monuments in the city, located in the Apollo Bunder area in South Mumbai. It is a distinct high arch built from yellow basalt and reinforced concrete. Many elements of the arch are derived from the Islamic architectural styles of 16th century Gujarat, the pillars are derived from the design of Hindu temples and the design of the Gateway's windows derive from Islamic architecture. The Gateway of India was built to commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to Mumbai, prior to the Delhi Durbar, in December 1911. The foundation stone was laid on 31 March 1911, by Governor of Bombay Sir George Sydenham Clarke, and the final design of George Wittet was sanctioned in August 1914. The foundations were completed in 1920, and construction was finished in 1924. The building got the name the Gateway of India, because in the colonial era the Europeans entered India from this location, it was normally the first thing they would see while entering the country. Taj Hotel The Taj Mahal Palace hotel resort was commissioned by Tata and first opened its doors to guests on 16 December 1903. The original Indian architects were Sitaram Khanderao Vaidya and D. N. Mirza, and the project was completed by an English engineer W. A. Chambers. The cost of construction was £250,000 (£127 million today). During World War I, the hotel was converted into a 600-bed hospital. The dome of the hotel is made from the same steel as used in the Eiffel Tower. Jamsedti Tata imported the same steel during that time. The hotel was the first in India to install and operate a steam elevator.  Art Deco  The Deco period began in 1910 when Art Nouveau slid out of fashion. Art deco's linear symmetry was a distinct departure from the flowing asymmetrical organic curves of its predecessor style art nouveau. Art Deco is an eclectic style and designers drew inspiration from many sources. Artifacts from Ancient Egypt and Greece, Meso- America, Africa, Japan and China that had all been influential. Cubism, Orphism, Futurism and Constructivism provided an abstract, geometric language that was quickly assimilated into the Deco style and the high styles of European tradition continued to provide inspiration. Art Deco had a unique impact in America, especially in Manhattan. Skyscrapers, such as the Chrysler Building in New York, became icons of the new style, while jazz became the music of the city. The popularity of Hollywood films did much to promote Art Deco to an international audience worldwide. Art Deco is one of Mumbai's least noticed architectural styles, though Mumbai and its suburbs possibly have the largest number of Art Deco buildings in the world. Art Deco in India (and especially in Mumbai) evolved into a unique style that came to be called Deco- Saracenic. Essentially, it was a combination of the Islamic and the Hindu architectural styles. The main features of the Indo Saracenic Style were the construction of domes, arches, spires, stained glasses and minarets. The interiors have Victorian influences while the exterior was Indian. Deco details touch every architectural aspect – lamps, flooring, wood paneling, lifts, railings and grills, muntins, chajjas or weather shades, plinth copings and mouldings, cornices, verandahs and balconies, bronze and stainless steel fittings, brackets, etched glass, ornamental sculptures that extended to names carved out in giant letters, facades that are very airy and built in stepped -back style, etc. Mumbai's Art Deco stands out not only because it uses the easy blend of Deco-Saracenic but also because architects have used a variety of materials to express design freely. For instance, many buildings have been constructed entirely out of reinforced cement concrete but has a facing of Malad stone. Bharat Tiles, India's oldest tile manufacturers, also played an integral part in the shaping of Art Deco interiors. Some of the most visited architectural sites in Mumbai are: * The Mahalakshmi Temple * The Jahangir Art Gallery * The High Court * The General Post Office * The Flora Fountain * Regal Cinema Eros CinemaMetro Inox Cinemas, designed by Thomas W. Lamb. Art Deco architecture in Mumbai developed during the 1930s and produced distinctly angular shaped buildings with facades. Mumbai has the second largest number of Art Deco buildings in the world. The Art Deco style is also extremely popular amongst various Cinema halls that sprung up in the early to mid 20th Century including Metro Cinema, Eros Cinema, Liberty Cinema and even Regal Cinema. Eros Cinema is a typical art deco building, designed by architect Sohrabji Bhedwar. The foundation of Eros Cinema was laid in 1935. The cinema opened in 1938 and construction of this building on the then newly reclaimed Backbay plot housing shops and other businesses, apart from the cinema, took about two and a half years to complete. Partially faced with red Agra sandstone, this building is painted cream. The two wings of this Art Deco building meet up in a central block. The foyer is in white and black marble with touches of gold. Marble staircases with chromium handrails lead up to the upper floor. The murals are in muted colours depicting Indian architectures. The Metro Inox Cinemas, located on Mahatma Gandhi Road, at Dhobitalao Junction is also a good example of the Art Deco style of architecture that appeared in the 1930s in the city. The Metro Cinema opened on 8 June 1938 and was designed by noted American theater architect Thomas W. Lamb. It was built for Metro Goldwyn Mayer and seating was provided for 1,491 people in orchestra and balcony levels. The auditorium reopened in 2006 and was sub-divided into six large luxury screens. The cinema features mainly Bollywood and Hollywood films. Contemporary architecture and development Bombay Stock Exchange building — an example of contemporary architecture. As the wealthiest city in India, Mumbai attracts an enormous amount of international investment and has seen a large number of modern high-rise office buildings and flats spring up in recent decades. In many parts of the city, particularly the newer suburbs, modern buildings dominate the landscape away from the old part of the city. Mumbai has by far the largest number of skyscrapers in India, with 956 existing buildings and 272 under construction and many more planned as of August 2009. The tallest skyscrapers in Mumbai include the Palais Royale, The Imperial, and One Avighna Park. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) was established in 1974 by the Government of Maharashtra to manage the planning and co-ordination of development activities in the city and to overlook the architectural development of the city. In 1995 the Heritage Committee in Mumbai was established and, unifying architects, historians and citizens to preserve the city's tradition architectural heritage. A grading system has since been used under the heritage regulations to categorize buildings according to importance: the most important landmarks of national significance are categorized as Heritage Grade I, buildings of regional importance as Heritage Grade II and buildings of urban importance as Heritage Grade III.

It comprises a capstan or a wide drum with a vertical axle. A rope is wound around the drum, with both ends traversing several pulleys and hanging down the mine shaft. As the drum is turned around, one end of the rope is lowered, carrying an empty bucket, while the other one is raised, carrying a full load. The major benefit of a whim is that its operation can be performed at a distance from the shaft, thus resolving some of the congestion. Early whims were horse-powered, but later they were powered by waterwheels or steam engines, including the most advanced Cornish engines. Whims were used in coal mines until the end of the nineteenth century. Horse whims were also used to power team boats. The gin wheel at Nottingham Industrial Museum dating from 1844, is a wooden drum, set on a vertical pole within a wooden frame, with a horizontal shaft from the drum for attaching to a horse.

Based on a real-life serial rape case, \\"Pilot\\" features two brothers, an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and a mathematics professor at a Southern California university, using their individual skills to capture a serial rapist who has begun to kill his victims. \\"Pilot\\" also introduces the theme of mathematics being used to solve crimes. Written by series creators Cheryl Heuton and Nicolas Falacci, the episode was filmed twice, once in Boston, Massachusetts and once in Los Angeles, California, with two different casts using two somewhat different scripts. The test audience could not believe that the three men who portrayed the family could be related to each other, so the producers made cast changes to the family. They also made several changes to the rest of the cast to accommodate the changes in the script. Heuton and Falacci changed the script to focus on the brothers' relationship with each other. When filming finished, CBS picked up the episode and the series three weeks later. \\"Pilot\\" first aired in the United States on January 23, 2005. The episode received mixed reviews. Mathematicians and students at California Institute of Technology enjoyed the episode and were impressed with the mathematics in it. In contrast, television critics felt as though the episode's plot about a serial rapist was unoriginal, although one critic called the math boring. Plot summary FBI Special Agents Don Eppes (Rob Morrow), Terry Lake (Sabrina Lloyd) and David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard) investigate a serial rapist who has begun killing his victims. With the twelfth victim, Karen Silber (Kate Norby), changing her story again and the thirteenth victim's car missing, Don runs out of viable leads. Taking a map and a case file with him, Don goes to his childhood home, owned by his father Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), to take a shower. Don's younger brother, Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz) of CalSci's mathematics department, finds and studies the map which Don lays on the dining room table. As Don prepares to return to the office, Charlie tries to talk Don into letting him help with the investigation and is inspired by the pattern of drops emanating from the family's sprinkler. He tells Don that he can use a mathematical model to find the neighborhood where the rapist resides. Skeptical, Don agrees to let Charlie assist him in the investigation. Charlie develops the model needed to find the rapist and refines it with graduate student Amita Ramanujan's (Navi Rawat) assistance. Charlie's model yields what he calls a \\"hot zone\\", an area in which the suspect probably lives. As the case progresses, Silber is found dead in her house. Don and his team resort to comparing DNA samples of men who live in the hot zone to samples of the rapist/killer. Using statistical analysis, Charlie deduces that Silber lied about where her rape took place. After Don learns from Silber's colleagues where Silber was raped, Charlie refines his equation, which yields a smaller area within the original hot zone. DNA, however, clears everyone in the original hot zone. As a result, Assistant Director in Charge (ADIC) Walter Merrick (Anthony Heald) pulls Don and his team from the investigation. At the same time, Dr. Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol), Charlie's colleague and friend, encourages Charlie to make his equation \\"less elegant\\" and to evaluate the worth of his consultation work. Back at the Eppes house, Charlie and Don discuss what went wrong. Alan is confident that the math is correct. Don tells Charlie that if Charlie ran his model on Don, the model will not show Don at his apartment. Instead, it would zone in on his office, where he spends most of his time. Charlie then realizes that he needs to modify his model to identify two hot zones, one where the suspect possibly resides and one where he possibly works. Using the new equation and a list of potential suspects who work in the new hot zone, Don, Terry, and David confront the suspect and find his latest victim, who is still alive. After Don kills the suspect in a hostage situation, he calls Charlie down to the crime scene to tell Charlie that the suspect lived in the original hot zone but moved three weeks earlier. This revelation proves that Charlie's models are correct. Production Original pilot Two pilots were filmed. Fascinated by mathematicians, creators Cheryl Heuton and Nicolas Falacci decided to create a show about one. With the encouragement of CBS development executives, they wrote several pilots revolving around mathematicians and scientists, including the pilot for Numb3rs, over the course of 14 years. Knowing that mathematics would not be readily accepted by the general public on its own, Heuton and Falacci in 2003 decided to use the police procedural format to facilitate the acceptance. When Falacci and Heuton pitched the pilot, CBS agreed to produce it about halfway through their presentation. Although they had considered several story ideas, Heuton and Falacci wanted to feature a case in which math was used to solve a traditional type of crime. They decided to base the episode on a real-life serial rapist case in which police asked Dr. Kim Rossmo to assist them in the investigation. In 1998, Rossmo, then with the Vancouver Police Department, was called in to help Lafayette, Louisiana, police investigator McCullan Gallien find the South Side Rapist. Rossmo and Gallien visited the crime scenes, and Rossmo used criminal geographic targeting, a mathematical model used to find the area in which the suspect would most likely reside. Together, Rossmo and Gallien developed a map indicating the most likely location of the rapist's residence. After DNA cleared everyone living in the area, Gallien learned that a sheriff's deputy in a neighboring department, Randy Comeaux, was a potential suspect. He had lived in the area during the time frame of the rapes but moved to a residence in the neighboring jurisdiction some time later. DNA on a cigarette butt left by Comeaux confirmed that he was the rapist, and Comeaux was arrested. The pilot was originally filmed in Boston, which was selected because of Falacci's familiarity with the area and because of the contrast between academia and the working class. Filming began in the spring of 2004. Although the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) refused to allow filming on campus, the cast and crew spent two days filming in the city. Dr. Tony Chan of UCLA's physical science department consulted on the original pilot episode. Although initially hesitant about auditioning, David Krumholtz was the first person cast and won the role of Charlie Eppes. Other original cast members were Len Cariou as Alan; Gabriel Macht as Don; Peter MacNicol as Charlie's mentor; Anna Deavere Smith as Don's boss; Jennifer Bransford, Michael Rooker, and Alimi Ballard as FBI agents; and Navi Rawat as a MIT graduate student. When filming was completed, executive producers Ridley Scott and Tony Scott and producer Skip Chaisson added graphics and music to the footage. They also added transitions to assist the storytelling. To accommodate these changes, CBS allowed the producers to delay the delivery of the pilot to the studio by two weeks. Second pilot When previewed, the focus group liked the concept but hated the way the pilot was produced. Among the problems with the original pilot was the believability of the Eppes family in terms of both physical appearance and chemistry, with the chemistry of the actors being the larger issue. Although Heuton and Falacci liked Cariou, Macht, and Krumholtz, Heuton and Falacci did not know how the three actors playing the Eppes family would interact with each other until filming began. Since both the focus group and network executives liked the concept of the pilot, CBS decided to recast and reshoot it. Filming began again in September 2004. To accommodate the budget for the new pilot, the second pilot was set and filmed in Los Angeles. Administrators at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) agreed to allow producers to film the academic scenes at Caltech. Dr. Gary Lorden, one of Caltech's math professors, served as math consultant of the second pilot. The producers kept Krumholtz, MacNicol, Rawat, and Ballard. Rooker and Macht left the cast, and Rob Morrow replaced Macht as Don. Other casting changes included the addition of Sabrina Lloyd as a FBI agent, Judd Hirsch as Alan, and Anthony Heald as Don's boss. The producers rewrote the script to accommodate changes in story, characters, and basic idea of the series. They decreased the role of Don's boss to focus the main conflict on the brothers' worldviews. They rewrote the structure and composition of Don's team. They also revised the start of Charlie's involvement with the investigation to incorporate Heuton and Falacci's original idea of Don taking the work home with him. When the second pilot was presented to the focus group, the group liked it. CBS picked up the pilot three weeks after filming ended. Previews The second pilot was screened at Caltech on January 10, 2005, and Heuton, Falacci, Hirsch, Morrow, Krumholtz, and Lorden participated in a panel discussion after the preview. The students who saw the screening at Caltech enjoyed the episode. The pilot was then previewed during the Joint Mathematics Meeting in Atlanta, Georgia from January 12 through January 14, 2005. Ed Pegg Jr., a member of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) who watched the episode at the conference, stated that he liked it and that he was impressed with the decision to depict the mathematics accurately. As for premiering on network television, the pilot initially was to air on January 21, 2005, but it was moved to January 23, 2005, after the AFC Championship game in order to be seen by a larger audience. When it premiered on TV on January 23, 2005, 25 million people watched the pilot episode of Numb3rs, beating the audience for the pilot episode of Desperate Housewives by about 4 million viewers. Reception Reception of the pilot varied according to the audience in question. The pilot was very well received by the mathematics community. Within a couple of weeks of Pegg's article for the MAA, Keith Devlin, another member of the association, gave the pilot a very favorable review. As for the mainstream media, the reviews for the pilot were mixed. Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly commented that, given that the case was about a serial killer, the pilot did not show the math in an original way. John Leonard of the New York Magazine called the cast \\"superb\\" but criticized the pilot for being too busy. Melanie McFarland, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer's TV critic, asserts that the pilot's storyline was an \\"unfortunate choice\\" for the pilot episode. Robert Bianco of USA Today stated that the pilot's storyline was unoriginal. Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle, however, stated that the pilot and the cast were excellent but that the math was uninteresting. DVD notes On the Numb3rs season one DVDs, three features address both pilots. The bonus feature \\"Point of Origin: Inside the Unaired Pilot\\" on the Numb3rs: The Complete First Season DVDs highlights the differences between both pilots and features clips from the original pilot. In the feature, creators Heuton and Falacci, executive producers Ridley Scott and Tony Scott, co-executive producer David W. Zucker, casting director Mark Saks, and producer Skip Chaissom detail the changes in cast, filming, wardrobe, and makeup. On the audio commentary for the \\"Pilot\\", Heuton, Falacci, Morrow and Krumholtz discuss not only additional changes in the pilot but also additional production trivia from the second pilot. Although the bonus feature \\"Crunching Numb3rs: Season One\\" features clips and discussions for other episodes throughout the season, it also addresses the production of the second pilot.

Career He raced in the NASCAR Grand National Series from 1953 to 1956. Like J.D. McDuffie, Alan Kulwicki, and Joe Nemechek, Mounts was an \\"independent\\" race car driver who would never receive manufacturer's support or the support of blockbuster sponsors. Arden would earn six finishes in the top ten from the 37 races that he would compete in NASCAR.

During his career, Mounts would earn $2,505 in race winnings ($ when adjusted for inflation) and race 4489 laps - the equivalent of . Only the 1953 and 1956 NASCAR Cup Series seasons would see him finish better than he started in the races. Mounts would end up losing nearly one position on average from start to finish during his entire career. His appearance at the 1955 Southern 500, where he would crash into Don Duckworth's stalled vehicle, would be captured on highlight films for generations. While Bill Champion managed to avoid Duckworth by swerving past the vehicle rapidly, Arden Mounts managed to see the stalled vehicle too late and crashed into him in a very hard manner. The proper usage of seat belts on the stock car automobiles would save the lives of both Mounts and Duckworth. The types of racing tracks that best favored Arden was the dirt tracks where he finished an average of 18th place; intermediate tracks were very much a disadvantage to Mounts, where a finish of 42nd place was the career average for him.

Difference algebra is analogous to differential algebra but concerned with difference equations rather than differential equations. As an independent subject it was initiated by Joseph Ritt and his student Richard Cohn.  Difference rings, difference fields and difference algebras  A difference ring is a commutative ring R together with a ring endomorphism \\\\sigma\\\\colon R\\\\to R. Often it is assumed that \\\\sigma is injective. When R is a field one speaks of a difference field. A classical example of a difference field is the field K=\\\\mathbb{C}(x) of rational functions with the difference operator \\\\sigma given by \\\\sigma(f(x))=f(x+1). The role of difference rings in difference algebra is similar to the role of commutative rings in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. A morphism of difference rings is a morphism of rings that commutes with \\\\sigma. A difference algebra over a difference field K is a difference ring R with a K-algebra structure such that K\\\\to R is a morphism of difference rings, i.e. \\\\sigma\\\\colon R\\\\to R extends \\\\sigma\\\\colon K\\\\to K. A difference algebra that is a field is called a difference field extension.  Algebraic difference equations  The difference polynomial ring K\\\\\\\\{y\\\\\\\\}=K\\\\\\\\{y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n\\\\\\\\} over a difference field K in the (difference) variables y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n is the polynomial ring over K in the infinitely many variables \\\\sigma^i(y_j),\\\\ (i\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}, 1\\\\leq j\\\\leq n). It becomes a difference algebra over K by extending \\\\sigma from K to K\\\\\\\\{y\\\\\\\\} as suggested by the naming of the variables. By a system of algebraic difference equations over K one means any subset F of K\\\\\\\\{y\\\\\\\\}. If R is a difference algebra over K the solutions of F in R are :\\\\mathbb{V}_R(F)=\\\\\\\\{a\\\\in R^n|\\\\ f(a)=0 \\\\text{ for all } f\\\\in F\\\\\\\\}. Classically one is mainly interested in solutions in difference field extensions of K. For example, if K=\\\\mathbb{C}(x) and R is the field of meromorphic functions on \\\\mathbb{C} with difference operator \\\\sigma given by \\\\sigma(f(x))=f(x+1), then the fact that the gamma function \\\\Gamma satisfies the functional equation \\\\Gamma(x+1)=x\\\\Gamma(x) can be restated abstractly as \\\\Gamma\\\\in\\\\mathbb{V}_R(\\\\sigma(y_1)-xy_1).  Difference varieties  Intuitively, a difference variety over a difference field K is the set of solutions of a system of algebraic difference equations over K. This definition has to be made more precise by specifying where one is looking for the solutions. Usually one is looking for solutions in the so-called universal family of difference field extensions of K. Chapter 4 Section 2.6 Alternatively, one may define a difference variety as a functor from the category of difference field extensions of K to the category of sets, which is of the form R\\\\rightsquigarrow \\\\mathbb{V}_R(F) for some F\\\\subseteq K\\\\\\\\{y\\\\\\\\}.. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the difference varieties defined by algebraic difference equations in the variables y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n and certain ideals in K\\\\\\\\{y\\\\\\\\}, namely the perfect difference ideals of K\\\\\\\\{y\\\\\\\\}. Theorem 2.6.4 One of the basic theorems in difference algebra asserts that every ascending chain of perfect difference ideals in K\\\\\\\\{y\\\\\\\\} is finite. This result can be seen as a difference analog of Hilbert's basis theorem.  Applications  Difference algebra is related to many other mathematical areas, such as discrete dynamical systems, combinatorics, number theory, or model theory. While some real life problems, such as population dynamics, can be modeled by algebraic difference equations, difference algebra also has applications in pure mathematics. For example, there is a proof of the Manin–Mumford conjecture using methods of difference algebra. The model theory of difference fields has been studied.

Despite having lived in Australia since the 1960s, he is not a citizen of the country. This caused visa problems when he tried to return to Australia after having gone to Japan with his son Adam (also a boxer) for a boxing match in 2007. The New South Wales Police Force tried to bar Vella from re-entering Australia then, but he was eventually allowed to return. In 2014 Vella visited his friends in family in Malta, and while he was there, his residency visa was cancelled by the Australian Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. Vella tried to appeal in the High Court in October 2015, but was not permitted to.  Private life  Vella was born into a strict Catholic family in Malta and was one of eleven children. His parents lived in a small villa near Buskett. He began work at the age of eight, carrying buckets of water on a building site for 30 cents a day, and is functionally illiterate. He and his family then moved to Australia in the 1960s and established a strawberry farm near Horsley Park, New South Wales. In his 20s, he sometimes worked two or three jobs at a time; as a bouncer, labourer and bricklayer.

Legal issues  In 1990, police found a $15,000 stash of marijuana while searching his home, which they believed to be a methamphetamine factory. He was sentenced to 18-months of two-nights-a-week prison, and two-days-a-week community service. He has also been arrested, but not convicted, of a number of other crimes including stabbing two men and assaulting a woman. He was freed on appeal after being given six months in jail for the latter. On 28 May 2008, Vella won a court case against the ANZ Bank. He sued them for $2.7 million after his former business partner, Tony Caradonna, re-mortgaged three properties, including the Rebels' clubhouse, for $2.4 million by falsifying Vella's signature. He also claimed $300,000 was fraudulently withdrawn from their joint bank account. On 16 June 2014, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison cancelled Vella's residency visa on character grounds while Vella was visiting Malta. Vella attempted to challenge the action in the High Court of Australia, but on 16 October 2015 the court refused his application for leave to appeal.

In 2016, he completed his 30th season as head coach. Under his tenure, the Blue Demons have qualified for post-season competition play in 24 of his 33 completed seasons, including the last 17 seasons. In 2007, Bruno completed a two-year term as President of the Women's Basketball Coaches Association, a position to which he was elected by his peers. High school and college Born Douglas Bruno in Normal, IL. Doug Bruno played high school basketball at Quigley Preparatory Seminary South. Bruno played college basketball at DePaul University under Basketball Hall of Fame coach Ray Meyer, earning a letter three years, and starting two seasons. Coaching career High school Bruno started his coaching career in 1973–74 at the high school level, first as an assistant coach for the boys' team at Francis Parker High School in Chicago, then as a head coach in 1974–75 for the boys' team at St. Vincent DePaul High School. DePaul Bruno was named the head coach of the DePaul Blue Demons women's basketball program in 1976. In the first season, the team achieved an 11–10 record,. In the second season the team achieved a 16–6 record, the most wins in the program's history. Chicago Hustle Bruno left DePaul to become the head coach of the Chicago Hustle, a women's basketball team in the Women's Professional Basketball League. They were originally going to be called the Hustlers, but that name reminded some of hookers. Bruno suggested changing the name to simply the Hustle. On December 9, 1978, the Chicago Hustle played the Milwaukee Does in what was not just the inaugural game of the Women's Professional Basketball League, but the first professional women's basketball game in the United States. The game was played in the MECCA Arena (now UW–Milwaukee Panther Arena) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Bruno was 27 years old, younger than some of his players, trying to keep them calm while waiting to start their first professional game in front of national press services. When an English radio announcer interrupted him with advice, he lessened the tension with a mashup of some famous speeches, invoking the Duke of Wellington and Knute Rockne. He implored his teams, \\"remember girls, the battle of Dunkirk was won on the playing fields of Eton. Now, go out there and win one for the Gipper.\\" There were 7,824 people in the stands. Milwaukee scored the first points, but Chicago went on to take the lead. Poor free throw shooting by Milwaukee would prove critical, and Chicago would go on to win the first professional women's basketball game by a score of 92–87. In their first year, the Hustle tied for the Midwest Division crown. The league lasted three years, but Bruno left the Hustle after his second year. Bruno was involved in what has been called \\"[t]he WBL's most serious officiating dispute.\\" Bruno thought his point guard was getting roughed up, and had responded by kicking a folding chair in one game, although it was reported that he tossed the folding chair \\"30 feet across the floor at an official\\". In a subsequent game, he thought his point guard was fouled with no call, so he went after the referee. Three security guards pulled Bruno off the referee, but not before the fans got involved. The fights included 70 people, requiring a call to the police to restore order. After a delay, the Chicago team won 128–123 in overtime. Loyola Chicago Bruno then left coaching women to become the associate men's head coach at Loyola University Chicago under Gene Sullivan. He spent eight years at Loyola, during which the team had two 20 win seasons, and reached the Sweet Sixteen once, in 1984–85. DePaul Bruno returned to DePaul and women's basketball in 1988, returning to the head coaching position of the Blue Demons. His first season, the team achieved a 23–10 record, tying for first place in the North Star conference, and qualifying for post-season play. The team finished seventh in the WNIT. His team has qualified for post- season play all but three of the seasons since his return to DePaul. The team was a member of the North Star conference until the 1990–91 season, then was a member of the Great Midwest Conference for four years. That conference then merged to become part of Conference USA, where DePaul remained until joining the Big East in 2005. In his first year as a member of the Big East, Bruno's Blue Demons achieved a 23–7 record, and made it to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship. DePaul announced in 2009 that the basketball court at McGrath-Phillips Arena will be named the Doug Bruno Court in his honor. The decision was kept a surprise, and announced at the annual Doug Bruno Challenge Dinner. Doug was told the dinner attendance wasn't meeting expectations, and asked if his six sons could help bolster the attendance by showing up and bringing friends. USA Basketball 2006 USA U18 and U19 National Team Bruno was selected to be the head coach of the USA Women's U18 and U19 teams in 2006 and 2007. The U18 team competed for the FIBA Americas Championship, held in Colorado Springs, Colorado from June 28–July 2, 2006. The USA team defeated Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina, and Canada to win the Gold Medal, and qualify for the 2007 FIBA U19 World Championship, in Bratislava, Slovakia. The following year, Bruno coached the team to a perfect 9–0 record and a Gold Medal at the U19 World Championship. USA would play a close game against Spain in an early round, winning only by eight points 74–66, but in the medal round rematch, USA defeated Spain easily, 69–46. The USA team faced undefeated Sweden in the championship game, but won easily 99–57. USA Women's National Team Bruno was named to an assistant coaching position for the USA women's national basketball team. The team begins training in 2009 in preparation for the 2010 World Championships. Training camp was held in Washington, D.C., after which the team visited wounded soldiers at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Following completion of the training camp, the team will head to Ekaterinburg, Russia, to compete in the 2009 UMMC Ekaterinburg International Invitational. Bruno served as an assistant coach for the USA National Basketball team at the 2010 World Championships. He will continue as an assistant at the 2012 Olympic games. Bruno was named assistant coach of the USA National team in preparation for competition at the 2010 World Championships and the 2012 Olympic Games in London. Because many team members were still playing in the WNBA until just prior to the event, the team had only one day of practice with the entire team before leaving for Ostrava and Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic. Even with limited practice, the team managed to win their first game against Greece by 26 points. The team continued to dominate with victory margins exceeding 20 points in the first five games. Several players shared scoring honors, with Swin Cash, Angel McCoughtry, Maya Moore, Diana Taurasi, Lindsay Whalen, and Sylvia Fowles all ending as high scorer in the first few games. The sixth game was against undefeated Australia—the USA jumped out to a 24-point lead, but the Australian team cut the lead back to single digits late in the game. The USA prevailed 83–75. The USA won their next two games by over thirty points, then faced the host team, the Czech Republic, in the championship game. The USA team had only a five-point lead at halftime, which was cut to three points, but the Czechs never got closer, and went on to win the championship and gold medal. Bruno was an assistant coach for the USA women's national basketball team at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. WBCA Bruno served as a member of the Board of Directors of the Women's Basketball Coaches Association in 2003 and 2004. Bruno was then elected President of the organization for a two-year team, starting September 1, 2005. His term officially ended in 2007, but he acted as President at the 2009 convention. The organization has a President and a past President—if the President is the coach of a team in the Final Four (occurring the same time as the annual convention), the Past President presides. However, in 2009, both Past President Sherri Coale of Oklahoma, and President Geno Auriemma of Connecticut had teams in the Final Four, so Bruno stepped in as acting President at the annual convention.

They managed to overpower their captors and reach Aden, Yemen, in what was described a \\"daring and dramatic escape.\\" Background Somalia has not had an effective government since 1991, when a dictatorship was overthrown, plunging the country into chaos. The ensuing power vacuum, and the lack of authority in the country has resulted in a surge in piracy, which occurs along Somalia's coastline, the Gulf of Aden, and the Indian Ocean as well, areas through which run some of the world's busiest shipping lines. The Egyptians, fishermen working for a company called Mashreq Marine Product, were captured with their two fishing vessels, Mumtaz 1 and Samara Ahmed, by Somali pirates in April 2009. Both vessels had permits to fish off Somali shores. Reports estimate two dozen to forty fishermen being captured by the Somali pirates. The latest and apparently most accurate figure, from Al-Ahram, states 33 fishermen were taken hostage. The 33 Egyptians kidnapped by name (last name, first, middle) and hometown were, on board the Mumtaz 1: el-Berliss, Abdullah el-Faqey, Kafr el-Sheikh; al-Matriah, Ahmed Habeesh, Daqhaliya; el-Berliss, Ibrahim el-Sayed, Kafr el- Sheikh; el-Berliss, Mahmoud Mohamed, Kafr el-Sheikh; el-Berliss, Osama el- Sayed, Kafr el-Sheikh; Ibrahim, Ibrahim Mohamed, Damietta; Khaleel, Ahmed Ali, Damietta; Khaleel, Mohamed Ali, Damietta; al-Matriah; al-Araby Mohamed, Daqhaliya; al-Matriah, Ibrahim Ahmed, Daqhaliya; al-Matriah; Mohamed al-Araby, Daqhaliya; al-Matriah, el-Sayed Galaby, Daqhaliya; al-Matriah, el-Sayed Mohamed, Daqhaliya; Murro, Hassan al-Qitty, Damietta; Musa, al-Hussein Abd el- Gelil, Damietta; Saqr, Mohamed Fuad, Damietta.

Al-Ahram, August 15, 2009, Issue no.:44812, p.22 Mohamed Alnahdi, executive manager of Mashreq, negotiated with the pirates for over a month, but failed to secure the fishermen's release after the pirates, originally demanding 800,000 to $1.5 million, rejected a ransom of $200,000. Escape The fishermen rose against their captors on August 13. They were being held on their vessels in Las Qorey, a pirate stronghold located on the coast in northern Somaliland. Despite being held on both ships and thus separated, the fisherman coordinated their actions against the captors, using the tools and machetes they were able to get hold of against the pirates, before seizing their guns and using it against them. At least two pirates were killed and an unknown number wounded. There were no casualties among the Egyptians, who took control of Momtaz 1 and Samara Ahmed and set sail for Aden, bringing along four prisoners. Local residents saw the boats leaving Las Qorey. Conflicting accounts There have been conflicting accounts of the number of pirates killed in the struggle. Al Jazeera reports that seven pirates washed up on Somali beaches. Other news agencies report that two pirates were killed, one was wounded and fled to safety, and eight were detained and taken to Egypt. The lack of any acknowledgment of the conflicting accounts suggests the possibility that successive news agencies republished the story without doing any original research or fact checking. \\"Somali pirates' bodies washed up\\". Al Jazeera. Sourced 2009-08-20. See link. Aftermath The incident was not unprecedented in that a hostage crew fought back against its captors. The first occurred in April, when 21 American crewmen fought against Somali pirates in what was known as the Maesk Alabama hijacking, until the ship's captain handed himself over as a hostage to save the lives of his crew. He was held hostage until freed by the United States Navy. The Egyptians returned safely to Yemen, ending their four-month ordeal. The Egyptian Embassy in Sana'a offered them air travel to Egypt, but the fishermen turned down the offer, opting instead to return via their recaptured fishing vessels. They left Yemen on Friday, en route to the Ataka Port in Suez, after turning the four prisoners to Yemeni authorities, from where they will face trial on charges of piracy either in Yemen or in Somalia, while it is unlikely that they will be turned over to Egypt. The fishermen were scheduled to arrive in Suez on August 20. In Somalia another pirate was taken into custody by police after local fishermen found him on a shore, with machete wounds on his body.

The title is derived from the expansion of J. Allen Hynek's classification of close encounters with aliens, in which the fourth kind denotes alien abductions. The film is a pseudodocumentary, purporting to be based on real events occurring in Nome, Alaska in 2000, in which psychologist Dr. Abigail Emily \\"Abbey\\" Tyler uses hypnosis to uncover memories of alien abduction from her patients, and finds evidence suggesting that she may have been abducted as well. At the beginning of the film, Milla Jovovich informs the audience that she’ll be playing a character based on a real person named Abigail Tyler. Jovovich says the film will also feature archival footage of the real Abigail Tyler. The \\"Abigail Tyler\\" seen in the archival footage is played by Charlotte Milchard, and at various points throughout the film, the archival footage scenes and accompanying dramatic re- enactments are presented side by side in split-screen. The film received mainly negative reviews from critics but made US$47.71 million in cinemas worldwide. Plot Chapman University hosts a televised interview with psychologist Abigail \\"Abbey\\" Tyler (Milla Jovovich/Charlotte Milchard). She tells a story of a close encounter incident at Nome, Alaska, in October 2000. In August 2000, Abbey's husband, Will (Yulian Vergov), is mysteriously murdered one night in his sleep, leaving her to raise their two children, Ashley (Mia Mckenna-Bruce) and Ronnie (Raphaël Coleman). Abbey tapes hypnotherapy sessions with three patients who have the same experience: every night a white owl stares at them through their windows. Abbey hypnotizes two of them, and both recount similar terrifying stories of creatures attempting to enter their homes. Tommy Fisher (Corey Johnson), her first patient to go under hypnosis, refuses to admit what he sees and returns home. Later that night, Abbey is called by the police to Tommy's house, where she finds him holding his wife and their two children at gunpoint. He insists that he remembers everything and keeps asking what \\"Zimabu Eter\\" means. Despite Abbey's attempts to get Tommy to put his gun down, he shoots his family and turns the gun on himself. After hearing the similarities in the accounts of nightly occurrences, Abbey suspects these patients may have been victims of a non-human kidnapping. There is evidence that she herself may have been abducted, when an Assistant gives her a tape recorder, which plays her voice and the sound of something with a distorted electronic voice entering her home and attacking her. It speaks in an unknown tongue; Abbey, though, has no memory of it. Abel Campos (Elias Koteas), a colleague from Anchorage, is suspicious of the claims. Later, Abbey calls upon Dr. Awolowa Odusami (Hakeem Kae-Kazim), a specialist in ancient languages who was a contact of her late husband, to identify the mysterious language on the tape. Odusami identifies it as Sumerian. Another, more willing patient named Scott (Enzo Cilenti) wishes to communicate. He admits that there was no owl and speaks of \\"them\\", but cannot remember anything further, but does say that he knows why Tommy did what he did. Later, he insists Abbey come to his home to hypnotize him, to get something seemingly horrific out of his head. But while he is under, he suddenly jerks upright and begins hovering above his bed, while a distorted electronic voice coming out of his mouth tells Abbey in Sumerian to immediately end her study. Later, Sheriff August (Will Patton) arrives, telling her that Scott had three upper vertebrae completely severed from his experience, and was completely paralyzed. The Sheriff tries to arrest her, but Campos comes to her defense, seemingly confirming her story. The Sheriff instead places her under house arrest. One of the deputies stays to watch the house and starts recording with his dash-cam. The dash-cam footage shows a large black triangular object flying over the Tyler house. The video then distorts, but the deputy is heard describing people being pulled out of the house and calls for backup. Deputies rush into the house, finding Ronnie and Abbey, who is desperately sobbing, screaming that Ashley was taken into the sky. Sheriff August, not believing in her abduction theory, accuses her of her daughter's disappearance and removes Ronnie from her custody. Ronnie, though, goes with them willingly, not believing the alien abduction theory either. Abbey undergoes hypnosis in an attempt to make contact with these beings and reunite with her daughter. Campos and Odusami videotape the session, and once hypnotized, it is revealed that Abbey witnessed the abduction of her daughter and also shows scenes of her own abduction, showing part of the abductors ship and it is hinted that they possibly took some human egg cells from Abbey as well. The camera scrambles, and Abbey begs the alien that abducted Ashley to return her. The creature replies, saying that Ashley will never be returned. It then calls itself the savior, then the father and finally ends with \\"I am ... God\\". When the encounter ends, Campos and Odusami rush over to the now unconscious Abbey and then notice something out of camera's view. The camera scrambles again, and a volatile voice yells \\"Zimabu Eter!\\". When the camera view clears it shows that all three of them are gone. The film cuts to an interview with Abbey in which she explains that all three were abducted during that hypnosis session and no one has any memory of what happened. The film returns to the aftermath of Abbey's hypnosis session. She wakes up in a hospital after breaking her neck in the abduction. There, August reveals that Will had actually committed suicide, showing that Abbey's belief that he was murdered was merely a delusion. Later it is shown that Abbey is paralyzed in a wheelchair, presumably due to her neck injury. The film then returns to the present interview, where the Interviewer asks Abbey how they, he and the viewers, can believe her if most of what she thought was only in her mind. Abbey tearfully tells him that she has to believe that Ashley is still alive. The interviewer ends the interview as Abbey breaks down in tears. In the film's epilogue, it states that Abbey was cleared of all charges against her, leaves Alaska for the East Coast, and deteriorates to the point of being completely bed-bound and requiring constant care. Campos remains a psychologist and Odusami becomes a professor at a Canadian university. Both men, as well as August, refuse to be involved with the interview, while Abbey's son Ronnie remains estranged from Abbey and still blames her for Ashley's disappearance. It also states that Ashley was never found. However, as is repeatedly stated in the movie: \\"In the end, what you believe is yours to decide\\". Cast Production This is the first major film by writer and director Olatunde Osunsanmi, who is a protégé of independent film director Joe Carnahan. The movie is set up as a re-enactment of allegedly original documentary footage. It also uses supposedly \\"never-before-seen archival footage\\" that is integrated into the film. The Fourth Kind was shot in Bulgaria and Squamish, British Columbia, Canada. The lush, mountainous setting of Nome in the film bears little resemblance to the actual Nome, Alaska, which sits amidst the fringes of the arctic tree line, where trees can only grow about 8 ft tall due to the permafrost on the shore of the Bering Sea. To promote the film, Universal Pictures created a website with fake news stories supposedly taken from real Alaska newspapers, including the Nome Nugget and the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner. The newspapers sued Universal, eventually reaching a settlement where Universal would remove the fake stories and pay $20,000 to the Alaska Press Club and a $2,500 contribution to a scholarship fund for the Calista Corporation. Critical reception The Fourth Kind received mainly negative reviews from critics, many of whom were offended that the film attempted to use the real life tragedies of missing and deceased Nome citizens in order to make money using a fictitious story about alien abduction. The film currently has an 18% rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 114 reviews. The site's consensus reads \\"While it boasts a handful of shocks, The Fourth Kind is hokey and clumsy and makes its close encounters seem eerily mundane.\\" American critic Roger Ebert gave it one and a half stars out of four, comparing it unfavorably to Paranormal Activity and The Blair Witch Project, while praising Milla Jovovich's acting.Ebert, Roger (November 4, 2009). The Fourth Kind (review). Chicago Sun-Times Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly called the film \\"rote and listless.\\" CNN reviewer Breanna Hare criticized The Fourth Kind for \\"marketing fiction as truth\\". Nome, Alaska Mayor Denise Michels called it \\"Hollywood hooey\\". According to Michels, \\"people need to realize that this is a science fiction thriller\\". Michels also compared the film to The Blair Witch Project, saying, \\"we're just hoping the message gets out that this is supposed to be for entertainment.\\" References External links   Category:2009 films Category:2009 horror films Category:2000s science fiction films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Alien abduction films Category:2000s thriller films Category:American supernatural thriller films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:American psychological thriller films Category:American psychological horror films Category:American science fiction films Category:American science fiction horror films Category:American horror thriller films Category:Films about ancient astronauts Category:Films set in 2000 Category:Films set in Alaska Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in British Columbia Category:Films shot in Bulgaria Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Films about extraterrestrial life Category:Alien invasions in films Category:Gold Circle Films films Category:Films produced by Joe Carnahan Category:Films scored by Atli Örvarsson ","title":"The Fourth Kind"},{"id":"23992772","title":"Colombia at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics"},{"id":"23992782","text":"Lieutenant Colonel Victor Brereton Rivers was the first Intelligence Staff Officer of the Canadian militia on 6 February 1901.

Vol. 9, Devon, Parts 1 & 2, Phillimore Press, Chichester, 1985, Chapter 36:2 The village is within the North Devon Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and on the South West Coast Path. Next to the village is Bucks Woods which includes the site of the Iron Age Hill fort at Peppercombe Castle. Pack donkeys at Buck Mills, 1906 The stream which runs through the village powered at least one mill. It falls over the cliff edge in a waterfall onto the beach which has large pebbles and hard sandstone formations. In the Elizabethan era a break in the rocks, known as the Gut, was created by Richard Cole (1568-1614), lord of the manor of Bucks, by blasting the rock with gunpowder to allow access to the small harbour built by him,Risdon, p.242 which has since disappeared, creating a small harbour for fishing vessels. In the 18th century this was used for the import of culm, a mixture of anthracite and limestone which was burnt in kilns to produce fertiliser. The remains of two of the lime kilns can be seen on either side of the beach access. In the 18th and 19th centuries many of the residents of Bucks Mills and the surrounding villages were related to the Braund family and King Cottage within Bucks Mills was once the home of Captain James Braund who was informally known as the \\"King of Bucks\\". St Anne's church was built in 1862. The church was endowed by Mrs. Elwes, the Lord of the Manor of Walland Cary, the estate on which the village stood. At Bucks Mill Cabin resided artist Mary Stella Edwards and Judith Ackland.

During the reign of King Edward II (1307-1327) Stephen de Wallen granted to Robert Stockey and his heirs that their tenement of Potesford and Bulkworthy should have a right-of-way for ever upon his land of Bokish and Wallen, for the purposes of carrying \\"sea-oar\\" (some type of mineral ore) and sand from the sea \\"with all carriages whatsoever\\", which deed was witnessed by Matthew Crawthorne, Joel Pollard, Gilbert Wibbery and Walter Beaple. The manor was later acquired by means unknown by the Cole family of Slade in the parish of Cornworthy in Devon, a branch of Cole of NethwayVivian, p.213 in the parish of Brixham in Devon, one of whom was John Cole (born c.1376), twice a Member of Parliament for Devon, in 1417 and 1423 and Sheriff of Devon 1405–6.History of Parliament biography The last of the Coles of Bucks was Richard Cole (1568-1614), also of Slade, who died without progeny and whose large and elaborate monument with effigy dressed in armour survives in All Hallows Church, Woolsfardisworthy.

It was the twenty-first and last Block IIR GPS satellite to be launched, and the eighth to use the modernised IIRM configuration. GPS IIR-21 was built by Lockheed Martin, based on the AS-4000 satellite bus, with the navigation payload being built by ITT. It was launched by a United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket, using the 7925-9.5 configuration, on 17 August 2009 at 10:35 GMT. It was the last spacecraft to launch from Space Launch Complex 17A at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, a launch pad which was first used in August 1957 for test flights of the PGM-17 Thor missile. It is also the final flight of an AS-4000 bus, the final GPS launch on a Delta II, and the final Delta II launch to be overseen by the US Air Force. Following separation from its carrier rocket, GPS IIR-21 received its USA designation, USA-206. It was deployed into a transfer orbit, from which raised itself to a semi-synchronous medium Earth orbit on 19 August, using an onboard Star 37FM apogee motor. It is a satellite, and is expected to operate for at least ten years. Once it had completed on-orbit testing, it began covering Slot 3 of Plane E of the GPS constellation, replacing USA-126, or GPS IIA-26, which was launched in July 1996.

Construction and commissioning Originally, Rogers Blood was planned to be the Rudderow-class destroyer escort USS Rogers Blood (DE-605), and was laid down as such on 12 April 1945 by Bethlehem- Hingham Shipyard at Hingham, Massachusetts. She was launched on 2 June 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Robert M. Blood. Rogers Blood was re-classified as a Crosley-class fast transport and redesignated USS Rogers Blood (APD-115) on 17 July 1945. She was commissioned on 22 August 1945 with Commander John W. Higgins, Jr., USNR, in command. Service history On 8 September 1945, Rogers Blood departed Boston, Massachusetts, for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where she completed a six-week shakedown cruise, and was then ordered to Chester, Pennsylvania, to participate with the submarine USS Sabalo (SS-302) in Navy Day ceremonies which brought approximately 40,000 persons as visitors. She was in the Norfolk Navy Yard at Portsmouth, Virginia, from 31 October 1945 to 15 November 1945, then moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where she reported to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. On 18 November 1945 she arrived at the St. Johns River in Florida for lay-up. Decommissioning and disposal Rogers Blood was decommissioned and placed in reserve on 19 March 1946 and berthed at Green Cove Springs, Florida, where she remained until stricken from the Navy List on 1 June 1960. She was sold on 14 December 1961 to the Southern Scrap Material Company of Louisiana for scrapping.

Its purpose was to protect the interests of the companies and their shareholders, chiefly against parliamentary interference. It was an early example of a lobby organisation. History The Association had its roots in a meeting of railway company chairmen, held at the Railway Clearing House (RCH) in March 1854, to discuss parliamentary matters of concern, but a properly constituted organisation developed only slowly. This was partly a result of the independent nature of the Victorian railway companies and the number of company chairmen and senior officers who were Lords or MPs in their own right, and partly a reflection of the gradually increasing role of government in regulating railway company actions and the need for an 'industry' response. By 1858 a United Railway Companies' Committee (URCC) had been formed, but it foundered after three years and was only re-constituted at a meeting on 26 June 1867, held at the Westminster office of the Midland Railway Company.Alderman, p.20 The revived body's first achievement was to promulgate a standard format for the accounts of railway companies, drawn up by the Chief Accountants of five of the major companies. This was accepted by the Board of Trade and included as a Schedule in the Regulation of Railways Act 1868 (31 & 32 Vict., cap. 119).Bonavia, p.32 Simmons, Jack, 'Regulation Acts' in Simmons, Jack and Biddle, Gordon (eds), The Oxford companion to British Railway history: from 1603 to the 1990s, Oxford, New York: OUP, 1997, , page 418 The URCC was renamed 'The Railway Companies' Association' in 1869Bonavia, p.33 or 1870.Alderman, p.20 Its main task was to follow the progress of legislation which might affect railways, attempting to persuade MPs and Lords to vote in the 'railway interest', and giving evidence to parliamentary committees. It also promoted legislation designed to assist railway companies. This finally left the RCH free of a political role and able to concentrate on the commercial organisation of inter-company services. Membership of the Association received a boost with the arguments over the passing of the Regulation of Railways Act 1873 (36 & 37 Vict., cap. 48). The perceived threats to profitability, through regulation of the rates which the 'monopolist' railways could charge, led to several moderately-large companies joining the major ones in the Association, finally giving it national coverage.Alderman, p.42 Chairmanship of the Association rotated amongst the Chairmen of leading railway companies. Much of the actual lobbying work of the Association devolved onto its parliamentary subcommittee, which consisted of Lords and MPs from the member companies' boards.Alderman, p.22 The Association had a small permanent secretariat, paid for by a precept of one or two shillings per £1,000 of the gross revenue of each participating company. The first Secretary of the Association was Kenneth Morison, who was also the first secretary of the RCH, but by 1873 the Honorary Secretary was Henry Oakley (knighted 1891), who was Secretary and then General Manager (1870-1898) of the Great Northern Railway.Alderman, p.159, pp.279-280Harris, Michael, 'Oakley, Henry (1823-1914)' in Simmons, Jack and Biddle, Gordon (eds), The Oxford companion to British Railway history: from 1603 to the 1990s, Oxford, New York: OUP, 1997, , page 356 He remained in post at the Association for the rest of 19th century, and the Association's activities were presumably co-ordinated from Oakley's offices at King's Cross. In the aftermath of the Regulation of Railways Act 1889 (52 & 53 Vict., cap. 57) and the industrial unrest of the 1890s, including the North Eastern Railway's unilateral recognition of the new trades union the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, the ad-hoc nature of the Association came under increasing pressure, leading to a restructuring.Alderman, p.186-191 This involved giving the secretariat a permanent base, in three rooms at 53 Parliament Street, leased from October 1900, and appointing a full-time paid secretary, the first being the rising barrister William Guy Granet, appointed in November 1905.Alderman, p.191, p.321 Later secretaries included barristers W. Temple Franks (1905-1909) and Arthur Beresford Crane (1909-1929).Alderman, p.321 The Association's role was necessarily reduced during World War I when parliamentary interest in domestic transport matters was low, railways being managed for the war effort under the provisions of the Regulation of the Forces Act 1871, but it gained in importance when the newly established post- war Ministry of Transport decided to deal with the railway companies jointly through the Association.Alderman, p.220 However, because the Railways Act 1921, during passage of which the Association lobbied for better compensation terms for shareholders,Bonavia, p.33 grouped British companies into four large concerns, another restructuring of the Association took place. The parliamentary members' council was abolished, severing the direct link with parliament, and the four new general managers constituted a standing committee of the Association. Briefings of independent railway-linked Lords and MPs continued however, for example in the companies' 1938 'Square Deal' campaign for reform of freight rates' legislation in the face of road competition (which was overtaken by the onset of war in 1939)Harris, p.414 and in the run up to the Transport Act 1947 which nationalised the railways. With all railways then under a single management within the British Transport Commission, the Association was wound up at this point. Nomenclature Modern commentators (Bonavia, Harris) drop the apostrophe in the name of this organisation, but Alderman includes it (when not abbreviating it to 'Railway Association'). Despite not having had opportunity to examine the Association's minutes, one feels sure that the Victorians would also have been grammatically correct and we have retained it here. The Association doesn't seem to have been referred to by its initials 'RCA'. Records The minutes of the Association were printed and distributed to the member companies, so several sets survive.Alderman, pp.253-254 They are available for consultation in The National Archives, together with other papers relating to the Association, and in the National Archives of Scotland.

Said Jackson: \\"Monte Kiffin was the difference. I love Tennessee. I have known Coach Orgeron for a while and I love him.

He was suspended for the week 9 game against Memphis for violating team rules. On November 12, 2009, Jackson and fellow freshmen teammates Mike Edwards and Nu'Keese Richardson were arrested after an armed robbery attempt at a Pilot station on Cumberland Avenue in Knoxville, Tennessee. Less than two weeks later, charges against Jackson were dropped because a police investigation found that he had no prior knowledge of the alleged attempted robbery. On November 24, he was reinstated to the Tennessee football team. After recording 37 tackles, a sack, an interception, a forced fumble, and a fumble recovery, Jackson was named to Rivals.com's 2009 SEC All- Freshman Team for his standout play. As a sophomore in 2010, Jackson started all 12 regular season games and compiled 65 tackles, 4 tackles for loss, a sack, 9 passes defended and 5 interceptions and was named to the All-SEC second team voted by the league's coaches.

Born in Wadena, Minnesota to Margaret (Corcoran) and Maurice Merrigan, she lived most of her life in St. Cloud, Minnesota, and later in Ojai, California. In 1950, she married LeRoy Steichen, and they became the parents of four children. Before becoming known for her writing, Steichen was a classroom teacher and religious educator, and was engaged in the pro-life movement from its inception. From 1980 to 1986, she served as vice-president and president, successively, of the Minnesota chapter of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights. Donna Steichen is best known to the general public for her best selling 1991 book Ungodly Rage: The Hidden Face of Catholic Feminism, a critical analysis of the impact of feminism on American Catholicism. During the 1980s Donna Steichen, like others within the Catholic Church, became alarmed by the manner in which many Church employees, including women religious, were expressing ethical values contradictory to those incorporated in such encyclicals as Casti connubii (Chaste Marriage) and Humanae vitae (Of Human Life). In the turmoil following the Second Vatican Council, many were open to new ideas and seeking untraditional ways to live. Among the main sources of such unorthodox ideas were \\"New Theology\\", feminism and New Age neopaganism. In particular, Steichen focused on what she perceived to be linkages between feminism and wicca, or as she commonly refers to it in her book, \\"witchcraft.\\" In Ungodly Rage, Steichen argued extremely forcefully that these views were contrary to revealed doctrine and that the dissenters were actually practicing a completely different religion from that taught by the Church. She contended that these heretical notions had been permitted to gain a foothold in American Catholic institutions by the US hierarchy, which was unwilling or excessively slow to investigate those responsible. The book, her first, was a success. It turned Steichen, who had been writing for a long time in small Catholic journals, into a significant figure in the move to restore orthodoxy within the Church. She became a noted figure on the lecture circuit in North America, England, Ireland, Europe,See Roberts, Tom, \\"Feminists say pope's attack was based on \`disinformation'\\" in St. Petersburg Times, July 17, 1993 Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines. Some have even claimed Steichen as an influence on Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI.  Other writings  Before Ungodly Rage, Steichen published a thirty-five page pamphlet titled \\"Population control goes to school\\" in 1988.Population Control Goes to School Since the publication of Ungodly Rage, Donna Steichen has edited a second book titled Prodigal Daughters: Catholic Women Come Home to the Church, published in 1998. In this book, Steichen helps document seventeen baby boomer women who were brought up Roman Catholic but gave up their faith, only to return later in their lives. Though well received, the book was not as controversial as Ungodly Rage, but in the 2000s, Steichen acquired a higher profile with writings in better-known journals such as Catholic World News, Latin Mass, LifeSite, Voices and Touchstone Magazine. Her most recent book is Chosen: How Christ Sent Twenty-Three Surprised Converts to Replant His Vineyard, published by Ignatius Press in September 2009.  Criticism  Some, like Elizabeth Knuth, have criticized Steichen and her book Ungodly Rage on the grounds that many of her sources are unreliable, that she misquotes Christian and pagan feminists, and vastly misinterprets the sources and its authors. More basic inaccuracies are also present throughout the book like how Steichen provides incorrect page numbers and book titles of some of her sources.

Early career  He was born the fifth son of Theodor Hermann von Spiegel zum Desenberg und Canstein (1712-1779), the Landdrost (Lord High Steward) of the Duchy of Westphalia who had ruled that province from 1758 in the service of the Elector-Archbishop of Cologne and Duke of Westpahlia, Clemens August of Bavaria. Descendant of an old Westphalian noble family and raised at Canstein Castle, Marsberg, Ferdinand August von Spiegel studied theology, law and economics at Fulda and Münster. There he became a canon in 1783, whereupon he received the tonsure and the lower orders. Educated in the spirit of the Enlightenment, Spiegel was in no way inclined to the status of clergy from which he only hoped for greater career opportunities, as did his elder half-brother Franz Wilhelm (1752-1815), who in 1758 succeeded his father and in 1786 became finance minister of the Electorate of Cologne. In 1788 Ferdinand August himself applied in vain for the Westphalian Landdrost position. However he obtained further canon benefices, in Osnabruck and Hildesheim. He was ordained a subdeacon in 1793. In 1790 he accompanied the Elector-Archbishop of Cologne and Bishop of Münster, Archduke Maximilian Francis of Austria, to the coronation of the latter's brother Emperor Leopold II, in Frankfurt am Main. Always striving for a leading position, he succeeded in being appointed Geheimrat in the Prince- Bishopric of Munster in 1796, especially since he had already shown enormous talent in administration as a vidame. In 1796 he was ordained deacon, but was not appointed vicar general as he had hoped. In 1799 he received ordination as priest. In August 1802, Prussian troops occupied Munster and Ferdinand August lost his secular office. But soon he was in good agreement with the Prussians and worked closely with them, especially since he hoped that this would give him a position in the secular administration. In February 1803, he managed to prevent the Münster cathedral chapter from being dissolved. In the confusion of the Napoleonic Wars, he largely withdrew from the public until 1810. But soon he was heard and respected by the French, so that on April 14, 1813 he was appointed Bishop of Münster by Emperor Napoléon. However, since he had concerns about the legality of an appointment without papal confirmation, he let the cathedral chapter elect him to be the second capitular vicar, to whom the actual capitular vicar, his eternal opponent Clemens August von Droste- Vischering, had to relinquish all competences. In these years, which were filled with an enormous amount of activity, Spiegel spiritually changed to be a truly religious Christian. After the fall of Napoleon, he again managed to establish close ties with the Prussians, whose benevolence he immediately regained. Hoping to become Minister of Culture, he renounced the diocese of Münster in 1815. From 1814 to 1815 he participated in the Vienna Congress, where he campaigned for a German national church independent of Rome. But since there was no settlement on church questions, he left. Although he had been denied a ministerial position, Frederick William III of Prussia created him a Count in 1816, together with his youngest brother, Caspar Philipp (1776-1837), an Austrian ambassador. In these years his political position changed from an advocate of a State Church to one of ecclesiastical freedom, and he became a sub-delegate of the executor of the Papal bull De salute animarum (1821). The Prussian government was impressed by the prompt and impartial completion of this work, which involved sensitive personnel issues, by approaching him with the offer to take over the Archdiocese of Cologne. He apologized to Pope Pius VII for his uncanonical behavior in 1813, which not only earned him pardon, but also an otherwise unlikely prompt appointment. After the king had again personally asked him to take the office, Count Spiegel was appointed archbishop of Cologne by Pope Leo XII on December 20, 1824 and ordained bishop on June 11, 1825.  Archbishop of Cologne  In the years that followed, Spiegel worked tirelessly and took all important decisions of his diocese himself. He was not always comforting the Prussian government, endeavoring to maintain the principle of ecclesiastical independence from the state. In the conflict over raising children in mixed- confessional marriages, he agreed with the Prussian government in 1834 on the so-called Berlin Convention. Contrary to his hope, this agreement with the state did not receive the necessary approval from Pope Gregory XVI. Before the mixed marriage dispute could break out openly, Ferdinand August, who had probably suffered from colon cancer since 1833, died on August 2, 1835 in Cologne. He was laid to rest in the archbishop's crypt of Cologne Cathedral. Clemens August von Droste-Vischering became his successor.

However, Osman Bölükbaşı was not a part of the cabinet and publicly criticized it. In the June 5, 1966 partial senate elections, the Nation Party won one seat, and in the October 12, 1969 elections, it won 6 seats in the parliament.

Many were later converted for push–pull operation with diesel locomotives, finally being withdrawn when displaced by the electric Dublin Area Rapid Transit service in the mid-1980s.  Background  The first single-unit diesel railcars in Ireland were introduced on the narrow-gauge County Donegal and Clogher Valley railways in the early 1930s. The Great Northern Railway and Northern Counties Committee followed shortly thereafter.Hirsch, pp. 141–42 However, early railcar trains did not exceed two cars in length.Doyle and Hirsch 1983, p. 131 Early in 1948, the GNR(I) ordered a fleet of 20 railcars, capable of operating in pairs with one or two intermediate trailer cars, from AEC. Introduced in 1950 and 1951, these vehicles drew on AEC's experience with the Great Western Railway's pre-war railcars. The cars combined AEC diesel engines (two per car, each of 125 bhp (93 kW)) with bodywork by Park Royal Vehicles.Jones and Marshall, pp. 119–20 CIÉ had been interested in railcars since its inception in 1945, but an initial plan for a four-car diesel-electric unit was cancelled.Doyle and Hirsch 1983, p. 126 However, the success of the GNR(I) cars and the 1948 Milne Report's recommendations in favour of railcars (but not diesel locomotives) encouraged the company to place a large-scale order with AEC in September 1950.Middlemass, p. 54Ó Riain pp. 70, 73 (Note also that 10 of the 20 GNR(I) AEC cars were inherited by CIÉ on the Great Northern's dissolution in 1958, along with 10 of 24 later cars built by the Great Northern Railway Board on British United Traction (BUT) underframes; the remainder went to the Ulster Transport Authority—see also UTA AEC.)Jones and Marshall, pp. 148–50  The CIÉ fleet   Initial order  In 1951, CIÉ ordered a series of 60 cars similar to the GNR(I) examples, again combining AEC engines and Park Royal bodywork.Doyle and Hirsch 1983, pp. 126–27 These vehicles were almost identical to the GNR(I) units but incorporated improvements derived from experience with the latter; most notably, up to four power cars, rather than two, could operate in multiple.Hirsch, p. 143 They were delivered between March 1952 and September 1954 and numbered in the series 2600–2659.  Bulleid cars  Six additional cars (2660–2665) were ordered in August 1954. Delivered in 1956, they were mechanically identical to the earlier vehicles—although the engines were now designated as BUT, rather than AEC, products. However, the cars' bodywork was constructed at CIÉ's Inchicore Works to a distinctive design by the company's Chief Mechanical Engineer, Oliver Bulleid. (It may be noted that CIÉ had faced political pressure to build the bodywork of the original cars itself, rather than importing complete vehicles.Ó Riain, pp. 73–74) Although the cars' length and width were identical to those of their predecessors, they were distinguished by flat sides and a high, flat front end. Even-numbered cars had the standard composite (two-class) seating arrangement, whereas odd-numbered ones had a single-class layout. The Bulleid cars had a short career in their original form, soon being rebuilt as powered intermediates (see below).Kennedy, p. 154Jones and Marshall, p. 151  Trailer cars  Various carriages were fitted or retrofitted with jumper cables to allow their operation in a railcar train. There were at least 88 trailers in total, including pre-1950s stock (one example dating from 1902), 1950s CIÉ vehicles, other 1950s stock from Park Royal Vehicles (manufacturer of the railcars' own bodywork) and 1960s Cravens vehicles.Flanagan, pp. 187–88. Examples included three composite (i.e. two-class) vehicles specially modified to work as through Cork–Belfast coaches on the Enterprise,Kennedy, p. 146 and 14 buffet cars capable of functioning either as a conventional buffet car (in which passengers consumed their food in the car itself) in locomotive-hauled trains, or as a kitchen vehicle with ordinary seating in railcar trains (whose passengers were served food at their seats, either in the car or elsewhere in the train) which were built in 1953 and 1954.Kennedy, p. 148 Trailers generally ran between a pair of power cars, although there were a number of driving trailers, described below; additionally, ordinary trailers were sometimes marshalled at the tail of a train, particularly in the 2600s' early days.Carse, p. 179 Two special Park Royal trailer vehicles for service on the isolated Waterford and Tramore Railway were built in 1955. These vehicles, like the railcars they worked with, had high-density seating arrangements. One of them was, additionally, fitted out as a driving trailer, with a guard's compartment at the non-cab end and a large area set aside for prams. Two further driving trailers, known as \\"mules,\\" were converted from 1953-built hauled stock but were used only briefly, working as part of the Westport portion of a Dublin–Galway/Westport train.Kennedy, pp. 147–48  Description  The 2600 Class were effectively identical to the GNR(I) cars in overall configuration, having a full-width driver's cab at one end, a gangway at the other, and underfloor engines. Their bodywork was conventional for CIÉ stock of the time, consisting of steel panels on timber framing.Kennedy, pp. 146–47 The underframe was of steel channel construction.Cuffe, pp. 171–72  Mechanical  The 2600s shared the engines and transmission of their GNR(I) predecessors, having two , 9.6-litre, six-cylinder, four-stroke engines driving the inner axles of the two bogies via fluid flywheels and Self-Changing Gears five-speed preselector gearboxes, with cardan shafts driving forward/reverse gearboxes on the ends of the axles. Multiple working was via 24-core jumper cables. The cars were fitted with two parallel vacuum brake systems—a conventional system and a second high-vacuum, quick-release system, based on reservoirs in which a vacuum was continually maintained, for use on services with frequent stops.Jones and Marshall p. 148Cuffe, pp. 169–71 Steam heating was originally fitted; even-numbered cars had a boiler in the guard's compartment, capable of supplying steam for up to four cars. Cars used on suburban services were subsequently fitted with a bus- type heating system that used the engines' cooling water.Cuffe, pp. 172–73  Seating layout  Almost all the cars were delivered with a two-class layout. A 12-seat first class saloon was located at the cab end of the car, a glazed partition behind the cab permitting forward (or rearward) views through the windscreen. A 32-seat second class (known as third class until 1956) saloon was positioned towards the gangway end, and there was also a guard's compartment and, in cars 2600–2647, a toilet. Cars 2648–2657 were intended for suburban use and devoid of toilets, permitting an extra four second class seats; apart from a lack of tables, they were otherwise identical to cars intended for longer-distance service. However, odd-numbered cars in this series subsequently had their guard's compartments removed to provide additional seating. Exceptionally, two cars (2658–2659) for use on the Waterford and Tramore Railway were delivered with high-density, single-class (although still divided into two saloons) layouts without toilets; the guard's compartment was also omitted from one car. Special trailer cars (see above) with similar high-density layouts operated with them. Most other cars were refitted with high-density, single-class layouts in the 1960s and early 1970s; these layouts seated between 70 and 91, depending on whether the toilet, guard's compartment or both were retained. Laytown in July 1970  Career as railcars  When originally delivered, the railcars were employed on mainline express trains, including crack workings such as a three-hour nonstop service between Dublin and Cork. Eight-car formations were commonly deployed on these duties, sometimes splitting en route to serve (for example) Tralee and Cork or Galway and Westport. By 1954, they were also operating on longer secondary and branch routes, such as Cork–Bantry. However, the arrival of diesel locomotives from 1955 onwards displaced the mainline 2600s to secondary workings.Doyle and Hirsch 1983, pp. 128, 153 Moreover, the fact that CIÉ operated its railcars in four-car (two power cars, two trailers) or eight-car (four power cars, four trailers) sets, whereas the Great Northern—and, in general, its successor in Northern Ireland, the Ulster Transport Authority—used its near-identical vehicles in two-car (both power cars) or three-car (two power cars, one trailer) sets, meant that the 2600s had a poor power-to-weight ratio.Flanagan, p. 63. One solution initially employed at busy times was to operate certain trains in a so-called \\"6+2\\" formation, comprising a power car, four intermediate trailers (usually including a dining car) and a second power car—thus giving passenger access throughout all six cars—followed by two extra power cars which were normally locked and inaccessible to passengers. From 1961, this arrangement was superseded by the use of powered intermediate cars, discussed below. By 1969, although suburban workings on \\"the relatively flat sections around Dublin\\" were formed of two power cars and two trailers, the remaining mainline workings used two-car sets. Additionally, obtaining spare parts proved troublesome as the railcars aged. As early as 1968, the AEC engines were considered obsolete, and spares were \\"virtually impossible\\" to obtain, forcing CIÉ to cannibalise some of the 2600s to keep the remainder running. In 1969, the only mainline services remaining railcar-operated were one round trip per day on each of the Sligo–Dublin and Dublin–Rosslare routes. The last mainline working was on the Dublin–Rosslare route in April 1970.Carse, p.180 By 1971, conversions of the cars to push–pull stock had begun. Early in 1972, it was reported that only a small railcar fleet would be retained in operational condition, pending the introduction of the push–pull trains. In late 1974, eight cars were reportedly being kept operational to address a shortage of locomotives \\"by reason of damage by accidents and bomb incidents.\\" The last five railcars were withdrawn on 20 September 1975. Ten of the 2600 Class, along with 19 of the AEC and BUT cars inherited from the Great Northern, were broken up rather than converted to push–pull stock.Jones and Marshall, pp. 144–46, 149–50  Powered intermediates and other modifications  Cars 2614, 2617 and 2656 from the original fleet were rebuilt following severe collision or fire damage. Cars 2614 and 2617 were returned to service in 1960 with new bodies whose sides resembled the Bulleid cars' but whose ends were similar to those of the original batch. These cars were further rebuilt in 1961, this time along with 2656 and all the Bulleid cars, into \\"powered intermediates\\" with engines but not cabs, which were renumbered into the 2660 series.Kennedy, pp. 147, 154–55 Odd-numbered powered intermediates seated 60, while even-numbered cars had 52 seats and a guard's compartment. The cars were substituted for trailer vehicles in certain trains, improving the trains' power-to-weight ratio. Other cars underwent changes in the seating layout, discussed above, as they were reassigned from long-distance to suburban service.  Career as push–pull stock  Howth Junction. In 1971, with the process of modifying railcars for suburban operations still underway, work began on the first conversions to push–pull stock for service with the then recently re-engined 201 Class locomotives. The conversion was intended to address both the cars' poor power-to-weight ratio and the increasing difficulties in obtaining spare parts for their engines.Cuffe, p. 174 The first test runs were made on the Dublin–Cork line in mid-February 1972. Trials on the Dublin suburban lines commenced in June 1972, and sets began entering service in February 1973. Operation on the Cork–Cobh line was also considered at one point.  Car types and train formations  Inside a push–pull vehicle at Drogheda in June 1980; note plastic chairs and period graffiti There were four types of push–pull vehicle:Doyle and Hirsch 1981, pp. 56–57 * Driving trailers, also known as \\"control cars\\" and numbered in the 61xx series, retained an operative cab and were marshalled at the end of the train remote from the locomotive. The cab retained most of the original (diesel- mechanical) railcar controls, which were modified to control the (diesel- electric) locomotive; for instance, the gear selector became the eight-notch power control. The guard's compartment contained a boiler for train heating and a diesel generator set to supply lights and boiler auxiliaries; because the generator blocked one of the compartment's doors, the guard normally travelled in the corresponding compartment of the connector car. * Connector cars, numbered in the 62xx series, were marshalled with their cabs (which were converted to vestibules, the windscreens being blanked off) next to the locomotive, to which they were connected with special control couplings. The purpose of the connector cars was to \\"convert the signals from the former railcar controls on the control car into a form which can be received and acted upon by the control equipment on the loco.\\" The cars also contained guard's compartments, which retained their heating boilers; however, as noted above, only the boiler in the driving trailer was normally used, whereas the location of the generator set in that car forced the guard to travel in the (normally unheated) compartment in the connector car. * Intermediate cars of the most common type, numbered in the 63xx series, were semi-permanently coupled in pairs at their (again inoperative) cab ends and marshalled in the middle of a set, their gangwayed ends being coupled to those of the control and connector cars to form a four-car consist. * Other, less numerous intermediates, confusingly interspersed with the other type within the 63xx series, were converted from railcar powered intermediates and, thus, had a gangway at each end and no cab. These vehicles could be marshalled between a driving trailer or connector car and an intermediate of the first type to give a five-car set. All cars' toilets were removed. There were originally nine five-car and three four-car sets. The first sets to enter service had the locomotive at the north end, but later ones were marshalled with the locomotive at the south end; the earlier sets were then turned on the triangle at Limerick Junction to standardise the position. However, the number of available driving trailers declined due to a spate of fires (at one stage, a \\"spare man\\" travelled in each driving trailer's generator compartment to detect and extinguish fires) and the fatal collision at Gormanston in 1974. There were only six driving trailers available by 1982; conventional locomotive haulage was, thus, often substituted for push–pull operation. The push–pull sets were \\"not very attractive and were not very comfortable\\", particularly due to ride problems arising from the vehicles' reduced weight compared to the original railcars. However, they \\"were cheap and could be quickly produced\\" and survived, \\"deeply unloved by those travelling,\\" until (and, in some cases beyond) electrification.Flanagan, p. 64.  Further seating modifications  Although the railcars had already received high- density seating, overcrowding of the push–pull trains was such that the transverse seats were replaced by longitudinal ones to give more standing room. Notoriously, the seating provided was similar to contemporaneous plastic stacking chairs in dingy shades of green and orange. In 1980, the driving trailers and connector cars typically had 58 seats, the standard intermediates 70 and the former powered intermediates 66; however, there were minor variations among the individual cars. Yet another modification took place in early 1984, when some cars intended for retention after electrification received \\"more comfortable seating.\\" This consisted of the then standard class high backed bench seats, seating three and two passengers respectively. The seats were upholstered in blue moquette with a vinyl headrest running along the top of the bench. Bray in July 1986  Final withdrawal  At the end of February 1984, five months before the inauguration of DART, only four sets remained. Most vehicles were withdrawn soon after electric services began (as they were replaced by the 8100 Class DART's); by 1985, there were only two sets of three cars each, one set used to provide a shuttle service between Bray and Greystones and the other as a spare. One of these sets was withdrawn in 1986, the other surviving to pass into Iarnród Éireann ownership in February 1987 and managing to outlast its normal motive power; the remaining 201 Class locomotives were withdrawn in 1986, and 121 Class locomotives were used thereafter. (Locomotive 121, then numbered B121, had undergone trials with push–pull stock as early as 1973.) During Hurricane Charley in August 1986, the shuttle train was even used to stand in for electric trains on the partially flooded main Dublin–Bray line. However, the shuttle was withdrawn in mid-September 1987, due to the poor condition of the rolling stock (the service was resumed at the end of October, using an 80 Class train hired from Northern Ireland Railways).  Reuse of number series  Both the number series originally carried by the railcars and that used for the push–pull conversions have been reused. Iarnród Éireann's first order of diesel multiple units, from Tokyu Car Corporation of Japan, received numbers in the 26xx series when delivered in 1994. Previously, the 61xx and 63xx series had been used, respectively, for driving and intermediate push–pull cars based on the British Rail Mark 3 design.  Disposal and preservation  6111 Arriving at Downpatrick Almost all the push–pull vehicles were scrapped at Mullingar or Dundalk. One, driving trailer 6111 (the former railcar 2624), was set aside for possible preservation.Jones and Marshall, pp. 153–57 It remained at Inchicore in a derelict condition until 7 February 2015, when it was purchased by and moved to the Downpatrick and County Down Railway. It is now undergoing restoration.  Notes   References  * Carse, B. (February 1972). \\"C.I.E.'s Railcar Fleet—2, Operational\\".

Connally High School is a public secondary school in Austin, Texas, United States. The school, which opened in 1996, serves 9-12 and is part of the Pflugerville Independent School District. Athletics Football Pflugerville Connally, since first opening, has been known as a powerhouse in the 4-A district through Texas. Perhaps one of the most memorable seasons, as quoted by Austin American-Statesman, was the 04-05 season, where the Cougars for the first time made it to the State Semi-Finals Championship round in the playoffs, losing by a score of 10 to 7 to Kilgore High School putting up an impressive record of 11-4. The program never had less than 8 wins in a season before switching from head coach Matt Monzingo to head coach Howard McMahan, going 7-4 the following season. After the move to the 5-A district after the 07-08 season, the football program plummeted significantly managing a horrible 3-7 record in the 08-09 season followed by an even worse 2-8 record in the 09-10 season. The 08-09 season marked the end of the Cougars streak of making the UIL State Playoffs Tournament for 11 years. Connally moved back into the 4-A district for the 10-11 season, earning a 10-2 record in a very competitive district. Baseball Pflugerville Connally's baseball program was established in 1997 after the opening of the high school. Typically known as a program who starts off sluggish until the start of district play. The baseball team has had sustain success since the 2002-2003 school year. That team was led by seniors Austin Boggs Texas A&M; University and Andy Morrison Southwestern University. The team made it all the UIL Regional Finals before losing to Brenham High School. The following year brought success as well. The 2003-2004 team was led by seniors MLB prospect Greg Golson New York Yankees and Drew Bias Baylor University. The '03-'04 team had an early exit from the UIL playoffs to the same Brenham High School from the previous year. The 2004-2005 kept up the track record of winning by repeating what the previous teams accomplished. The team was led by seniors Mason Dixon Texas A&M; International and the unknown emergence of Brandon Gamble Blinn College. The team defeated Austin Lanier High School in the 1st Round of the UIL Playoffs and was defeated in the next round by Dripping Springs High School. The 2005 - 2006 team did the same as previous years and made it to the 2nd round of the playoffs by beating Austin LBJ and falling short to the eventual Texas State Champions, New Braunfels High School. The team was led by Santos Reyes Southwestern University. Ryan Sasaki, a high school senior, was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in 2009. The following year, senior Anthony Bryant was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals. Basketball Though never reaching any major success, (The basketball program went to state in 2007 lost to Dallas South Oak Cliff), the Cougar Men's Basketball team have been a very talented group over the years, although the 09-10 season had been, by record, one of the worst in school history. The Cougar Women's Basketball team has experienced mixed success. However, both the 03-04 and 04-05 teams went to the State Quarterfinals. Led by coach Angie Hermsmeyer (University of Texas-Austin alum), the Lady Cougars have never had a losing season. Coach Hermsmeyer was recently replaced by Laura Zouzalik, who has been coaching for twenty-four years. Soccer The men's soccer class of 2009 brought statewide recognition to the program by becoming the first 4A high school, to move up in classes (5A) and a win a District Title undefeated. The team was led by senior midfielder Marco Alcocer (Clemson) and sophomore goalie Brooks Grubbs to an unprecedented 5A district title. The team went on to the Regional Finals that year in playoffs (2-0 victory over New Braunfels; 2-0 victory over San Antonio Marshall; 4-1 victory over San Antonio Warren; 1-0 Victory over La Joya in shootouts) and ended up losing to Brownsville Lopez, who later advanced to the state final. Head Coach John Mark Edwards was in his first year of coaching boys high school soccer and also was awarded with the Coach of the Year award by the district coaches. Cross town rival Pflugerville High School lost in the first round of the playoffs. https://www.uiltexas.org/historical- archives/athletics/archives/soccer/playoff_brackets/08_09/boys/5ABoysSoccer.pdf https://www.uiltexas.org/historical- archives/athletics/archives/soccer/index.html Other sports Baseball Head coach: Ryan Burns Assistant coach: Matt Grayless Assistant coach: Alex Pena Assistant coach: Hiram Drum Boys Basketball Head coach: Marshall Sanders Assistant coach: Shane Chambless Assistant coach: Eddie Lolis Girls Basketball Head coach: Laura Zouzalik Assistant coach: D'Ann Vander Laan Assistant coach: Crizelda Marroquin Assistant coach: Tammy Davis Cross Country Head coach: Shane Chambless Assistant coach: Katie Howerton-Landry Football Head coach: Howard McMahan Golf Head coach: Richard Horne Powerlifting Head coach: Andrew Rohrs Boys Soccer Head coach: Ryan Ford Assistant coach: Kevin McKinley Girls Soccer Head coach: Jessie McCartney Assistant coach: Jennifer Brewer Softball Head coach: Laura Mehl Assistant coach: Molly Baca Swimming Head coach: Russell Denny Tennis Head coach: Jane Lo Assistant coach: Roger Deroeck Track and Field Boys Head coach: Kevin Ellison Assistant Boys coach: Doug Patek Assistant Boys coach: Tobin Schneider Assistant Boys coach: Andrew Rohrs Girls Head coach: Dana Burnett Assistant Girls coach: Katie Howerton-Landry Assistant Girls coach: Ruxton Williamson Assistant Girls coach: Tammy Davis Volleyball Head coach: Christi Dreier Assistant coach: D'Ann Vander Laan Assistant coach:Shawna Lawless Assistant coach:Ruxton Williamson Wrestling Head coach: Bill Robertson Assistant coach: Michael O'Dea References External links *John B.

The de Rashleigh family had originated in the 14th century or before at the estate of Rashleigh in the parish of Wembworthy in Devon, of which the Barnstaple family was a later branch and of the latter the Fowey branch was a junior, but much the most successful, branch.

He was chief clerk in the Company Secretary's office until taking over as Secretary in 1858. He became General Manager of the company in 1870. He proved adept at the politics and negotiations required in railway management, and had taken on an additional role as Honorary Secretary of the Railway Companies' Association by 1873. He retained these extra duties until the Association was restructured on a more permanent basis in 1900. Oakley was elected to the GNR board in 1897 and retired as General Manager in 1898. In June 1900, a C1 class locomotive was named in his honour by the company; after its withdrawal from service in 1937 it was preserved, and survives at the National Railway Museum. After leaving the GNR he became Chairman of the Central London Railway, one of the new tube railways. In 1891 he was dubbed Knight Bachelor at Osborne House, Isle of Wight.

The bed material load is the portion of the sediment that is transported by a stream that contains material derived from the bed. Bed material load typically consists of all of the bed load, and the proportion of the suspended load that is represented in the bed sediments. It generally consists of grains coarser than 0.062 mm with the principal source being the channel bed. Its importance lies in that its composition is that of the bed, and the material in transport can therefore be actively interchanged with the bed. For this reason, bed material load exerts a control on river channel morphology. Bed load and wash load (the sediment that rides high in the flow and does not extract non-negligible momentum from it) together constitute the total load of sediment in a stream. The order in which the three components of load have been considered – dissolved, wash, bed material – can be thought of as progression: of increasingly slower transport velocities, so that the load peak lags further and further behind the flow peak during any event.  Sediment Transport  Bed-material load is composed of larger grains than any of the other loads. The rate in which grains travel is dependent on the transporting capacity of the flow. Particles move by rolling, sliding, or saltation (bouncing or jumping of grains) at velocities less than that of the surrounding flow. Rolling is the primary mode of transport in gravel-bed streams, while saltation in which grains hop over the bed in a series of low trajectories is largely restricted to sands and small gravels. Various equations are used to estimate the rate at which sediments are transported through the fluvial system. Bed-material discharge equations generally are applicable only within the range of flow conditions and sediment sizes for which the equations were derived. Variables used to characterize the bed material load transport as described by Kumar (2012) are as follows: – Channel geometry: b (width of the channel), y (flow depth) and BF (bed form of the channel) – Dynamic properties: Q\\\\ (channel discharge), Sf (friction/energy slope), τb (bed shear stress) and τc (critical shear stress or Shields’ shear stress) – Sediment properties: d (mean size of sediment), σ (gradation coefficient of the sediment particles) and Gs (specific gravity) – Fluid properties: ν (viscosity) Bed material load transport (C) is a function of all the above parameters, i.e.: C = f (b, y, BF, Q, Sf , τb, τc, d, σ,Gs, ν) Knowledge of sediment transport is important to such endeavors as river restoration, ecosystem protection, navigation, and infrastructure management.  Measurements  Direct and indirect methods are two ways in which bed material can be measured. Direct measurement is done through the use of a physical trap, placing the device in contact with the bed, “allowing the sediment transported as bedload to accumulate (or be trapped) inside the sampler for a certain amount of time, after which the sampler is raised to the surface and the material is emptied and weighed to determine a weight transported per unit time.\\" There are three types of direct samplers, which include a box or basket, pan or tray, and pressure difference as described by Hubbell (1964). Measurements of bedload discharge are rare and frequently of unknown accuracy because no bedload sampler has been extensively tested and calibrated over a wide range of hydraulic conditions. The box sampler has an opening that allows sediment to enter, the pan or tray samplers are placed in front of the open front of a box, and the pressure difference sampler is made to produce a pressure drop at the end of the nozzle. Accurate field measurements are very difficult to make, errors principally associated with the measuring devices themselves and with the extreme temporal variations in transport rate, which are a characteristic feature of bed material movement. Indirect measurements can be performed by a tracer, repeated channel surveys, bedform velocimetry, or velocimetry. No one method is entirely satisfactory, but indirect channel surveys, provided they are detailed enough at the reach scale, can produce reliable results, and have the advantages of minimum disturbance to the flow and time-integrated sampling which averages out short-term fluctuations in the transport rate.  Importance  Bed-material exerts a control on river channel morphology. The bed material load transport in alluvial rivers is the principal link between river hydraulics and river form and is responsible for building and maintaining the channel geometry.

Plot Leo Martin (Hartnell) works for a criminal gang run by Gus Loman (Lovell) that primarily uses a smash and grab tactic. During one particular risky robbery heist, Leo breaks the window at a jewellery store only to have his wrists broken by a security shutter falling on them. He is soon caught and brought to prison to serve his term. Throughout his stay, Leo does not reveal who he is working for to the authorities but instead serves his time, angered by Gus for running out on him during the robbery. When Leo is released, he returns to Gus to obtain a job. Gus harshly rebuffs him and points out how Leo’s injured wrists would prevent him from working as a thief. This leads Leo to seek complete vengeance against Gus. He decides to frame Gus for murder by stealing his gun and murdering the getaway driver (now working as a cab driver) who had also abandoned him during the abortive raid. He manages to provide himself with an alibi to avoid any prosecution. During this scheme he meets Carol Dane (Howard), who is unaware of his true nature, and the two begin a romance. Later he confronts Gus with the understanding that if he does not give him money he’llhand over the gun to the police. After Gus hands over the money, he contacts Gregory Lang (Lom), whom he is actually working under. Gregory is an antiques dealer who hired Gus to steal jewellery and art pieces for him. Meanwhile, Leo learns that Detective Inspector Rogers is investigating the murder case. He attempts to assure Rogers that he is attempting to live a life away from crime, but Rogers continues to question Leo’s character and whereabouts during the night of the murder. Things begin to go downhill when Leo and Gregory learn that it was actually Gregory’s gun that was used rather than Gus’s. Gregory becomes upset and has his companion plot to murder Gus while forcefully threatening Leo. Leo’s wrists are crushed again, but he and Gus reach a deal for Leo to bring back the gun and steal a jewel. All the while, Rogers uncovers more and more clues. When Leo steals the jewel and brings back the gun to Gregory, a gunfight ensues, leaving Gregory dead. As Leo jumps on the train to run away with Carol, she confronts him about his lies. Soon after, Rogers arrives after finally learning that Leo murdered the cab driver. He prepares to apprehend Leo, but Leo tries to jump out of the train window only to have the window slam shut on his wrists.

It was the 5th race of the 1960 season, and was won by Junior Johnson in a 1959 Chevrolet.  Summary The 200 lap race started with Cotton Owens on the pole and Jack Smith joining him on the front row. Junior Johnson won the four hour race driving a 59 Chevy owned by John Masoni. A crowd of 38,775 watched as Johnson drove the number 27 to victory after starting in the 9th position. Bud Burdick, Pappy Crane, Dick Foley, Dick Freeman, Tommy Herbert, Dave Hirschfield, Bob Kosiski, Shep Langdon and Bill Lutz would retire from NASCAR after this event.  Pre-race  In late January 1960, the CBS network sent anchorman Bud Palmer and 50 other employees to Daytona to cover the events in the first-ever televised coverage of a NASCAR event. CBS announced that their CBS Sports Spectacular show would televise a couple compact car races and the Grand National Pole Position races at Daytona on January 31st. On February 13th a Modified-Sportsman race took place. NASCAR officials lined up 73 cars to take the green flag. Less than a minute and a half after the green flag flew, mayhem ensued when Dick Foley's Chevy got out of shape. While Foley was able to gather control of his car, and finish the race in tenth place, 37 other vehicles behind him crashed while attempting to avoid the confusion. Twelve cars flipped, and a total of 24 drivers were unable to continue the race. Five ambulances responded to transport 8 drivers to local hospitals. Four drivers were released that day, and four drivers were held overnight. Notable drivers Ralph Earnhardt, Wendell Scott, and Speedy Thompson were among those forced out of the race. Driver Speedy Thompson was quoted as saying It took cleaning crews and tow trucks only 39 minutes to clear the track for the restart. Marion \\"Bubba\\" Farr went on to win the record setting crash fest. He drove a 1956 Ford modified with a 1958 Lincoln engine and 6 carburetors, and finished with an average speed of 116 mph.  Qualifying races  Fireball Roberts won the first 100 mile qualifying race, and Jack Smith won the second on the two and a half mile track. Roberts grabbed his victory on the paved oval completing the 40 laps in 45 minutes, with two cautions in a 1960 Pontiac. Roberts started second beside Cotton Owens who won the pole with a speed of 149 mph. Owens finished second, and Fred Lorenzen rounded out the top 3 with 2 cautions for 5 laps. The first caution came on lap 1 when Gene White, Dave Hirschfield, and Tommy Irwin all got together coming out of turn two. Irwin and his Ford Thunderbird took a trip into lake Lloyd located in the infield, and Irwin had to swim to safety as the car was nearly submerged. By the time the yellow flag had been displayed, Roberts had already advanced to the front of the pack, and would never relinquish the lead. The win would give Roberts his 22nd NASCAR victory. Smith and his 1960 Pontiac captured the victory from the pole with a qualifying speed of 148 mph, and completed the second race in just over 40 minutes with an average speed of 146.5 mph. There were 2 cautions; and Bobby Johns finished second with Jim Reed grabbing the third spot. The first single lap caution came when John Rosteck spun on lap six, and the second caution, also a one lap slow down, came when Johnny Dodd Jr. crashed into the wall on lap 15. The dubious distinction of bringing out the first ever black flag fell to Herman \\"Turtle\\" Beam on lap 8 when officials noticed that Beam was running without his safety helmet, which he had forgotten on the starting grid. Smith set a record for the time by winning with the combination of his speed, and the minimal caution laps. The win was Smith's second of the year, and 12,500 people looked on as he and Roberts grabbed the two top spots in the qualifying races.  Race  Race day was a brisk day with a high of , with steady winds at , strong gusts, and no rain. The high winds, combined with the high speeds resulted in 32 laps being run under caution, and multiple crashes. Tommy Herbert suffered a broken arm and severe eye injury when his T-bird flipped and blew apart when he crashed into the wall on the back straightaway on lap 118. The engine went one direction, the car another, and the front end assembly took flight up to 75 feet in the air. Driving through the wreckage, Pappy Crane spun, then rolled his Chevy, but was not hurt. Also included in the attrition was George Green whose car burst into flame forcing him to leap from the car to safety, and Tom Pistone who lost control with 2 laps remaining and hit the turn 4 wall. Junior Johnson took the lead with nine laps remaining when Bobby Johns spun, and Johnson went on to win the race. Johns had grabbed the lead on lap 172, but the winds pulled his back window out, and he lost control. The win was Johnson's first victory of the season. The 1960 race was is remembered as being the slowest Daytona 500 race in history, as Johnson averaged just 124 mph over the 500 miles.  Legacy  There were so many cars destroyed or damaged during the 500 that NASCAR officials felt compelled to cancel a couple races that were scheduled for the following weekend. Palmetto Speedway and Hollywood Speedway both lost their scheduled 100 mile events due to the carnage at Daytona. Race winner Junior Johnson went on to achieve multiple accolades in the following years; including being inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1990 and being selected as one of NASCAR's 50 Greatest Drivers in 1998. On February 4, 2010, NASCAR announced that Johnson would be Grand Marshal for the 50th anniversary of his 1960 victory. Part of Johnson's duties as Grand Marshal would be to utter the immortal words \\"Gentleman, start your engines\\" at the 52nd running of the Daytona 500 on February 14, 2010.

The chair first appeared on the market in a choice of charcoal or flame red colours at a little under £3 in price. The side chair won a Council of Industrial Design (now the Design Council) award in 1965. The brief from Hille was for a low cost mass-produced stacking chair, affordable by all and to meet virtually every seating requirement. Over time it became available in a wide variety of colours and with different forms of base and upholstery. These variations have included Series E for children, made in five sizes with lifting holes, and Polo with rows of graduated circular holes making it suitable for outdoor use. The one-piece seat and back was injection moulded from polypropylene, a lightweight thermoplastic with a high impact resistance.

After a stint at First Boston, he was recruited by Jeffery Beck to Oppenheimer & Co.'s Corporate advisory department. Cohen was responsible for the group's first eleven transactions, making upwards of $20 million for the departmentRainmaker, Anthony Bianco, page 148 as a 28-year-old partner. Cohen was contributing nearly 60% of the department's revenue, yet his lack of respect to senior management made him ineligible for bonuses. As a result, Cohen started taking a self-imposed fee on his deals; other Opco employees called these fees \\"Cohen Commissions\\". Due to his productivity, Cohen's self-imposed commissions initially went unpunished, however eventually Jeff Beck was forced to fire him. With money from his side dealings, and advice from Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken, Cohen started his own firm, Morgan Schiff & Co., who eventually became the majority and then exclusive shareholder of voting stock for the public company, EZCORP, Inc. headquartered in Austin, TX.
