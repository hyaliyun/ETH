At first it was mainly involved in harvesting wild rubber, but later moved into palm oil and mining. Background The German Wissman explored the Kasai River in 1884 and established a short-lived commercial establishment there. The Sandford Exploring Expedition started commercial operations on the river and founded the Luebo post in 1887, then in 1888 merged with SAB. In 1890 Le Marinal created Lusambo. The Soci√©t√© Hollandaise arrived in the region in 1890, and for six years SAB and the Soci√©t√© Hollandaise were the only traders in the region. In 1892 rules were established for harvesting rubber, and new companies began to move into the Kasai basin: *La soci√©t√© des Produits v√©g√©taux du Haut Kasai (1894) *Compagnie Anversoise des Plantations de la Lubefu (1897) *Soci√©t√© de la Djuma et La Kasaienne (1897) *La Loanje (1898) *Soci√©t√© anonyme du Trafic Congolais (1898) *Plantations Lacourt (1899) *Plantations L‚ÄôEst du Kwango (1899) *Les Comptoirs Congolais Velde (1900) A decree was issued in 1899 enforcing planting of rubber-bearing lianas, because harvesting wild lianas would not be enough to meet the expanding needs of the rubber market. By this time there were 14 companies employing 176 expatriates in 41 establishments. Cut-throat competition was keeping prices low, but also creating financial instability and reducing the amount paid to the local workers. Foundation Congo Free State concession companies. Kasai (green) in southwest. The Congo Free State and the 14 companies agreed to form a new body, the Compagnie du Kasai (Kasai Company) with head office at Dima in the Congo and administrative headquarters in Belgium. It would take over the facilities of the 14 companies such as buildings, boats and stocks, and all of their employees. The companies could keep the plantations they had created and their management, with certain restrictions. The purpose would be to harvest and trade plant products and ivory, as well as related commercial, industrial and agricultural operations. Capital of one million francs would be equally divided between the Congo Free State, which would receive half, and the 14 companies. The state would have representatives on the board of directors and management committee. The statutes of the company were published in the Official Bulletin in 1901. The company did not receive a concession like Abir or the Soci√©t√© Anversoise du Commerce au Congo (SCA), and its representatives were not commissioned to raise tax. It could therefore only obtain rubber and other forest products by dealing with the natives. Early years (1901‚Äì1918) The company began a rubber plantation at Bena Makima in October 1904. In a unique arrangement, four missionaries of the order of Scheut fathers took charge of planting rubber and of gathering wild rubber in exchange for having their goods transported at no charge on the steamer from Kinshasa to Luebo. The missionaries ran the plantation using bonded Luba laborers, former slaves from eastern and central Kasai who had recently been liberated. On 5 November 1904 the post was attacked by the Kuba. The Europeans managed to drive off the attackers with the help of their foreign workers, and were relieved on 9 November by soldiers of the Force Publique led by De Cock and Hubin, who arrived from the east. An official report in 1905 found that agents of the company had undertaken armed expeditions against the local people. The company was initially profitable. In the 1905 financial year it produced 1,400 tons of rubber, or 28% of total production in the Congo Free State. In the 1906 financial year production had risen to 1,500 tons. Profits fell in 1907 due to lower selling prices in Europe, and fell again in 1908. The company decided to expand into some far eastern businesses. In 1908 the Belgian government took over control of what became the Belgian Congo. By 1910 a factory of the company had been established near Misumba, which had about two thousand inhabitants. The company had made successful trial rubber plantations there. In 1910 there was a dispute between the government and the company. By decree of 22 February 1910 the Kasai basin was opened to free trade. In 1911 the company bought out the state's share and became fully independent. The company lost money in 1912 and 1913 due to the collapse of the rubber and copal markets. In 1913 the company was given the right to prospect for minerals south of the 5th parallel and in part of the Aruwimi River basin near Kilo- Moto. There were continued losses in 1914 and 1915, when the company started to buy palm nuts, and exported 385 tons. The company was profitable in 1916 and 1917, and broke even in 1918. That year it exported 593 tons of rubber, 3,536 tons of palm kernels, 90 tons of palm oil, 5 tons of ivory and 7 tons of beeswax. Later history (post-1918) In 1919 the company issued new shares to raise capital. Mining concessions were divided between the Soci√©t√© mini√®re du Kasai and the Syndicat g√©n√©ral de recherches mini√®res du Kasai. All mining operations were to be undertaken by Formini√®re. The Soci√©t√© mini√®re du Kasai, a mining subsidiary, was created in July 1920. Meanwhile, La Formini√®re had taken over operation of diamond mines started by the Compagnie du Kasai. In 1922 the company was granted concessions for palm oil explotation, consisting of five circles with a radius of . This now became the company's main activity. Three of the circles were improved by creating plantations of selected palms, growing food crops, building a road network and organizing road and water transport. By 1930 the rubber trade had virtually ended. During the economic crisis of the 1930s the company reduced overhead as far as possible. By 1934 the company was the second largest palm oil producer in the country after HCB. By 1935 it had sold shares to the Soci√©t√© Anonyme Belge pour le Commerce du HautCongo (SAB) in exchange for a plot in the Manghay region where it was cultivating coffee and cocoa trees. It had 7 steam oil mills, 10 manual oil mills, a coffee plant, cocoa processing plant, rubber plant and a plant for treating rice harvested by the local people. It had a road network, a fleet of river boats and loading and unloading facilities in L√©opoldville and Matadi. It also operated trading posts buying ivory, palm kernels, palm oil, peanuts, copal and textile fibers, and shops selling imported giods to expatriates and locals. As of 1945 the company was controlled by the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Belgique. It continued operating until at least 1955.1955 share certificate Notable people * Alphonse De Valkeneer (1898‚Äì1973) , governor of √âquateur Province from 1959 to 1960, served two terms with the Cie du Kasai from 23 April 1929 to 27 May 1934, before resigning and later joining government service. * Alphonse van G√®le (1848‚Äì1939), was a Belgian soldier who served as the Vice-Governor General of the Congo Free State from December 1897 until January 1899.

Redshift values show that there are approximately 200 galaxies associated with the group, approximately 70% of which are spiral and irregular type galaxies whilst the remaining 30% are elliptical and lenticular types.  Characteristics  The concentration of galaxies in the Eridanus area was first identified by Baker in 1933. A more in depth study and discussion of the region was carried out by de Vaucouleurs in 1975. Work by Willmer et al. in 1989 suggested that the Group is condensing from the Hubble Flow and is a prominent feature in the large-scale system called the Eridanus-Fornax-Dorado Filament. The group extends over approximately 10 Mpc and on the sky is bounded by the lines of 3hr6' and 4hr30' of Right Ascension and ‚àí10¬∞ and ‚àí30¬∞ Declination. The galaxies in the Eridanus Group are distributed in several clumps and overall the group has the appearance of an intermediate system, its structure being somewhere between that of a loose group (like the Ursa Major Group) and a cluster (like the Virgo Cluster). Dynamic studies indicate that the group is at an important stage of its evolution with the types of galaxy present already fixed. This suggests that galaxies involved in the formation of rich clusters are already highly evolved, a finding which supports aspects of Cold Dark Matter theories. The Group is forming from the merger of a number of sub-groups. The group is predicted to be in an early stage of formation and exhibits a high number of early type galaxies. The sub-groups involved in the merger include the Fornax I Cluster, the Eridanus Cluster (or Fornax II Cluster) and the Dorado Group. In some studies these have been broken down into further sub-groups including the Eridanus Group, the NGC 1407 Group and the NGC 1332 Group. Bright individual galaxies which are members of the group include NGC 1407 (the brightest), NGC 1332, NGC 1309 and NGC 1209. The group's significant population of S0 type galaxies has made it a target for investigation because of an ongoing debate over the formation of this species of galaxy. Within the surveyed sub-groups of the Eridanus Group it has been found that the brightest galaxy is often the elliptical or S0 type galaxy. Present theories on galaxy evolution suggest that S0 type galaxies form as part of the evolutionary process. This would suggest that there has been time for significant evolution of the galaxies within the Group, despite the young age of the Group itself.  Sub-groups  The term Eridanus Group has also been applied to a sub-group of the Eridanus Cloud. This grouping of galaxies is found at a distance of 14.2 Mpc. The Eridanus Group is known to have 31 members with nine listed in the New General Catalogue and two listed in the Index Catalogue. The brightest galaxy in this sub-group is the large elliptical, NGC 1395. The sub-group is not centred on any one galaxy and studies of X-ray emissions from the group indicate that it is dynamically young. It is involved, along with the NGC 1407 and NGC 1332 sub-groups, in the formation of the Eridanus galaxy supergroup with the three groups predicted eventually to merge to form a single poor cluster with a combined mass of approximately 7 √ó 1013 solar masses. The NGC 1407 sub-group contains most of the early type galaxies associated with the Eridanus Group.

These were rules to create films based on the traditional values of story, acting, and theme, and excluding the use of elaborate special effects or technology. It was supposedly created as an attempt to \\"take back power for the directors as artists\\", as opposed to the studio. They were later joined by fellow Danish directors Kristian Levring and S√∏ren Kragh-Jacobsen, forming the Dogme 95 Collective or the Dogme Brethren. Dogme () is the Danish word for dogma. History Dogme certifikate for Susanne Bier's \\"Elsker dig for evigt\\" (Open Hearts, 2001), Dogme No. 28. Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg wrote and co-signed the manifesto and its companion \\"vows\\". Vinterberg said that they wrote the pieces in 45 minutes. The manifesto initially mimics the wording of Fran√ßois Truffaut's 1954 essay \\"Une certaine tendance du cin√©ma fran√ßais\\" in Cahiers du cin√©ma. They announced the Dogme movement on March 13, 1995, in Paris, at Le cin√©ma vers son deuxi√®me si√®cle conference. The cinema world had gathered to celebrate the first century of motion pictures and contemplate the uncertain future of commercial cinema. Called upon to speak about the future of film, Lars von Trier showered a bemused audience with red pamphlets announcing \\"Dogme 95\\". In response to criticism, von Trier and Vinterberg have both stated that they just wanted to establish a new extreme: \\"In a business of extremely high budgets, we figured we should balance the dynamic as much as possible.\\" The first of the Dogme films (Dogme #1) was Vinterberg's 1998 film Festen (The Celebration). It was critically acclaimed and won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival that year. Lars von Trier's Dogme film, Idioterne (The Idiots), also premiered at Cannes that year but was less successful. Since the two films were released, other directors have made films based on Dogme principles. French-American actor and director Jean-Marc Barr was the first non-Dane to direct a Dogme film: Lovers (1999) (Dogme #5). American director Harmony Korine's film Julien Donkey-Boy (Dogme #6) is also considered a Dogme film. In total, thirty-five films made between 1998 and 2005 are considered to be part of the movement. The end credits of Het Zuiden (South) (2004), directed by Martin Koolhoven, included thanks to \\"Dogme 95\\". Koolhoven originally planned to shoot it as a Dogme film, and it was co-produced by von Trier's Zentropa. Finally, the director decided he did not want to be so severely constrained as by Dogme principles. Since the late 2000s, the emergence of video technology in DSLR photography cameras, such as the Canon EOS 550D, has resulted in a tremendous surge of both feature and short films shot with most, if not all, of the rules pertaining to the Dogme 95 manifesto. However, because of advancements in technology and quality, the aesthetic of these productions typically appears drastically different from that of the Dogme films shot on Tape or DVD-R Camcorders. Largely erasing the primitive and problematic features of past technologies, newer technologies have helped Dogme 95 filmmakers achieve an aesthetic of higher resolution, as well as of lower contrast, film grain, and saturation. Goals and rules The goal of the Dogme collective is to \\"purify\\" filmmaking by refusing expensive and spectacular special effects, post-production modifications and other technical gimmicks. The filmmakers concentrate on the story and the actors' performances. They claim this approach may better engage the audience, as they are not \\"alienated or distracted by overproduction\\". To this end, von Trier and Vinterberg produced ten rules to which any Dogme film must conform. These rules, referred to as the \\"Vow of Chastity\\", are as follows: # Shooting must be done on location. Props and sets must not be brought in (if a particular prop is necessary for the story, a location must be chosen where this prop is to be found). # The sound must never be produced apart from the images or vice versa. (Music must not be used unless it occurs where the scene is being shot.) # The camera must be hand-held. Any movement or immobility attainable in the hand is permitted. # The film must be in colour. Special lighting is not acceptable. (If there is too little light for exposure the scene must be cut or a single lamp be attached to the camera.) # Optical work and filters are forbidden. # The film must not contain superficial action. (Murders, weapons, etc. must not occur.) # Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden. (That is to say that the film takes place here and now.) # Genre movies are not acceptable. # The film format must be Academy 35 mm. # The director must not be credited. Uses and abuses The above rules have been both circumvented and broken from the first Dogme film to be produced. For instance, Vinterberg \\"confessed\\" to having covered a window during the shooting of one scene in The Celebration (Festen). With this, he both brought a prop onto the set and used \\"special lighting\\". Von Trier used background music (Le Cygne by Camille Saint-Sa√´ns) in the film The Idiots (Idioterne). Korine's Julien Donkey-Boy features two scenes with non-diegetic music, several shot with non-handheld, hidden cameras and a non-diegetic prop. Von Trier, however, praised the film's transgressions on an interview released on the Epidemic DVD. Like the No Wave Cinema creative movement, Dogme 95 has been described as a defining period in low budget film production. Since 2002 and the 31st film, a filmmaker no longer needs to have his or her work verified by the original board to identify it as a Dogme 95 work. The founding \\"brothers\\" have begun working on new experimental projects and have been skeptical about the later common interpretation of the Manifesto as a brand or a genre. The movement broke up in 2005.Kristian Levring interview (via Internet Archive) Criticism American film critic Armond White criticized the movement, stating that it was \\"the manifesto that brought filmmaking closer to amateur porn\\". He believed the movement would be rejected as insignificant by film historians.White, Armond (March 9, 2004, Updated Feb 16, 2015). \\"Digital Video Dogpatch: The king of false movement directs his ice queen\\", New York Press.

The use of 'Dogme 95' style filming is in a list of a hostage taker's demands in the Black Mirror episode, \\"The National Anthem\\". Keyboard player and music producer Money Mark used principles inspired by Dogme 95 to record his Mark's Keyboard Repair album.  Recognition  In 2015, the Museum of Arts and Design celebrated the movement with the retrospective The Director Must Not Be Credited: 20 Years of Dogme 95.

He enjoyed a lot of success in school cricket, playing in the school XI for three years, and captaining the side in his final year.Lawrence (2001), p73. He finished his schooling in the middle of the First World War (1914‚Äì1918), and was called up for service in the British Army. He initially served in the ranks of the Royal Field Artillery, but was commissioned as an officer, with the rank of second lieutenant, on 20 February 1917. He was wounded in action during the war. After demobilisation in 1919, Lyon chose to continue his studies at Trinity College, Cambridge. During his first year, he only played one first-class match for the university, against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's, and failed to get a 'blue'. His first-class debut however, came earlier than this, when he turned out for Somerset against Cambridge University Cricket Club at the end of May 1920. In the following match, a County Championship tie against Worcestershire, Lyon scored his maiden first- class century, hitting 115 in 135 minutes. During his second year, Lyon got his 'blue', appearing in seven first-class matches for Cambridge University before keeping wicket for a strong Cambridge side during the University Match against Oxford University Cricket Club. In a reversal from the previous year, he also played for Cambridge University against his Somerset team-mates. He once again kept wicket for a victorious Cambridge side against Oxford the following year. While at Cambridge he was also a member of Footlights, and president from 1921‚Äì23. England prospect Lyon was described in his Wisden obituary as being \\"considered by many to be among the best batsmen who never gained a cap for England\\". An amateur, he passed 1,000 runs in the 1923 season, and was selected to play for the Gentlemen in July of the same year. He scored 120 in the match, putting on 219 in a second wicket partnership with Greville Stevens. The following season, he was selected to play for 'The Rest' against England, in a three-day Test Trial match. Lyon recorded scores of 32 and 3, and took a catch in both innings during a three wicket loss. Lyon was the only member of the team not to go on to represent England at Test cricket. Fellow Somerset batsman Jack MacBryan wasn't impressed, saying of his friend, \\"Dar is a grand chap and a very fine cricketer. Don't know what the Test selectors were thinking about.\\"Foot (1986), p111. Later in the season, he hit his highest total in first-class cricket as he made 219 against Derbyshire. He once again represented the Gentlemen, but after scoring 11 in the first innings, was out for a duck in the second. Lyon only made six appearances in the County Championship during the 1925 season, the highlight being a century during the 93 run loss to Warwickshire. The following summer of 1926 was among the last in which Lyon played a significant number of games for Somerset, as he spent more and more time on his legal career,Foot (1986), p107. with his 20 appearances yielding 1062 runs. In a match against the touring Australians, Lyon showed the England selectors what they were missing out on. He played Clarrie Grimmett with little regard for the wrist-spinner's reputation and struck 136 runs in an innings total of only 245 for Somerset.Foot (1986), p108. He finished the summer on a high with a further century coming in the final match against Yorkshire. Recognition did come in the form of a call-up for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in May 1927, with Lyon making a half- century against Surrey, followed by a century against the New Zealanders. Sporadic performances in the late 1920s and early 1930s were highlighted by centuries against Essex and Surrey. When he was appointed to Gambia in 1932, Lyon's first-class cricket career was all but ended. A further appearance in 1935 against Middlesex resulted in a pair. He returned to Somerset in 1938, and played his final season for the county. Later life In 1923 Lyon took up farming in Suffolk. In 1925, he was called to the bar, practising on the South Eastern Circuit and in London. He stood as Liberal party candidate for Bury St Edmunds at the 1929 general election, finishing second. He was appointed a magistrate in Gambia in 1932. On 9 June 1933 (now described as an acting legal adviser) he was appointed to both the Executive and Legislative Councils of Gambia as one of the official advisors of the governor. He was then appointed a resident magistrate in Tanganyika, where he served until 1938. With the outbreak of the Second World War (1939‚Äì1945), Lyon was again commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on 28 December 1939. He served as a Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General at the War Office until 1941, when he was given command of a light anti-aircraft artillery regiment. After the war he moved to Kenya, where he was appointed a Resident Magistrate in 1945. He next became Chief Justice of the Seychelles in 1948, serving until 1957 when he was appointed a puisne judge of the Ugandan High Court. In July 1954 a petition signed by a number of leading residents of the Seychelles, asking that Lyon not be appointed for a third term, and making various allegations about his conduct, was sent to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Alan Lennox-Boyd in London. Lennox-Boyd decided there was no case to answer, but the petition caused considerable debate in the House of Commons in July and August 1956. Lyon served in Uganda until 1961, when he retired to the United Kingdom. He died at Hastings on 17 February 1964. He had been married twice. In addition to his cricketing and legal careers, he composed music for revues organised by Andr√© Charlot. Family Lyon's younger brother, Beverley Hamilton Lyon, known as Bev, played for Oxford University and Gloucestershire. The brothers were on opposing sides in the 1922 Varsity match. And in 1930, in the match between Somerset and Gloucestershire at Taunton, Dar scored 210 after being dropped twice by Tom Goddard, but Bev replied with a century of his own and led his side to victory by eight wickets. On 9 May 1928, Lyon married Helen Alice Earle (n√©e Elliot), who had been divorced earlier that year by Lyon's Somerset cricket colleague Guy Earle, whose second wife she had been. Helen Lyon was born in 1899 and died in 1967. They had one daughter, named Elizabeth Helen Lyon. His family were of Jewish origin.

Life and work Inzillo was born in Buenos Aires in 1944. He enrolled at the Universid√°d John F. Kennedy (a private, local college), earning a degree in journalism, and later, a doctorate in social psychology. While still in college, in 1963, he joined Radio Libertad as a programmer for emcee Jorge Ruanova's popular nighttime jazz program, Buenos Aires, Hora Cero (\\"Buenos Aires at Midnight\\"), and contributed to a local documentary film as music consultant. Inzillo learned solf√®ge and music theory from well-known Argentine Tango pianist Horacio Salg√°n during this interim, and mastered the clarinet. He remained on the radio in subsequent years, hosting El diccionario del jazz (\\"Jazz Dictionary\\") on Radio Municipal in 1966, Jazz sin barreras (\\"Jazz without Barriers\\") on Radio Rivadavia in 1967, Registros in√©ditos (\\"Unreleased Recordings\\") on Radio Municipal in 1968, Jazz a la carta on Radio Nacional in 1973, and Jazz contempor√°neo on FM Radio Nacional, in 1976, as well as organizing a number of jazz festivals, beginning with \\"Jazz & Pop\\" in 1969, and contributing a jazz column on a number of local magazines and radio programs during the 1970s and 1980s. Elections in 1983 resulted in Inzillo's appointment as communications director for the General San Mart√≠n Theatre, the most important of its kind in Argentina. He leveraged this post for the establishment of an annual jazz festival at the adjacent San Mart√≠n Cultural Center, Jazzolog√≠a. Featuring a varied repertoire and free to the public, Jazzolog√≠a premiered successfully on September 4, 1984, leading to Inzillo's creation of a smaller, outdoor version of the event, Jazz al caer la tarde (\\"Evening Jazz\\"), which he hosted at the center's southern plaza from 1985 to 2001. Jazzolog√≠a attracted both local and international vocalists and musicians over the next two decades, including Betty Carter, Pierre D√∏rge and his New Jungle Orchestra, Conrad Herwig, Sandra Mihanovich, Karlheinz Miklin, and Chuck Wayne, among many others. Organized annually by Inzillo with but one interruption (in 2007, for the center's refurbishment), the festival attracted over a million spectators in all, and his promotion of jazz in Argentina earned him a distinction as Honorary Citizen of the genre's birthplace, New Orleans, in 1985. Inzillo's many newspaper interviews for La Naci√≥n, La Prensa and Pagina/12 included renowned artists such as Gary Burton, Chick Corea, Al Di Meola, Paquito D‚ÄôRivera, B.B. King, Baden Powell, Lalo Schiffrin, Chucho Vald√©z and Joe Zawinul. Inzillo returned to radio as host of Jazzolog√≠a laser, on FM Jazz, from 1991, and Raices (\\"Roots\\") on Radio Nacional, from 1999 until 2003. A prolific historian in his subject, from 1974 onwards he hosted lectures on jazz-related subjects as diverse as Free Jazz, Alice Coltrane, St√©phane Grappelli, Jelly Roll Morton, Charlie Shavers and Sarah Vaughan. Inzillo was bestowed a Konex Award, the highest in the Argentine cultural realm, in 2005, and directed the Standards program for the 2008 Buenos Aires Jazz Festival.Buenos Aires Jazz References Category:Argentine journalists Category:Argentine jazz musicians Category:Argentine radio personalities Category:Jazz clarinetists Category:Argentine record producers Category:Argentine people of Italian descent Category:People from Buenos Aires Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century clarinetists ","title":"Carlos Inzillo"},{"id":"24674511","text":"This is a timeline of actions by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), an Irish republican socialist paramilitary group.

His father and uncle, co- princes Strojimir and Gojnik, had been exiled to Bulgaria with their families after their eldest brother Mutimir had ousted them and taken the Serbian throne. Klonimir married a Bulgarian noblewoman chosen by Khan Boris I himself. She later gave birth to a son named ƒåaslav. The descendants of the three Vlastimiroviƒá branches continued the feud over the Serbian throne which spanned over the century, and Klonimir returned to Serbia in ca. 896 and attempted to take the country from his cousin Petar, who had ruled since 891. He managed to take over the Serbian city of Destinikon, but the much more powerful Petar defeated him, and it is presumed that Klonimir died in battle. His son ƒåaslav later became the most powerful of the Vlastimiroviƒá dynasty, as Prince of Serbia from 927 to 960, unifying several tribes in the region.  Life  Serb lands in the 9th century. The history of the early medieval Serbian Principality and the Vlastimiroviƒá dynasty (ruled ca. 610‚Äì960) is recorded in the work De Administrando Imperio (On the Governance of the Empire), compiled by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (r. 913‚Äì959). Vlastimir, the eponymous founder of the Vlastimiroviƒá dynasty and the ruling Serbian Prince (archon) in the period of ca. 830‚Äì851, was a Byzantine ally who had managed to devastate the Bulgars in a three-year war (839‚Äì842), and greatly expand the Serbian realm to the west. Upon his death, the rule was inherited by his three sons, Mutimir, Strojimir and Gojnik, though supreme rule was held by the eldest, Mutimir. The three brothers successfully fought off a Bulgarian attack in 853 or 854 (shortly after the death of Vlastimir), when they had managed to capture 12 great boyars and the commander himself, Vladimir, the son of Khan Boris I of Bulgaria (r. 852‚Äì889). The Bulgars sought to avenge the defeat of their previous Khan, Presian.; DAI, pp. 154 The Serbs and Bulgars then made peace, and possibly formed an alliance. A quarrel eventually broke out between Vlastimir's three sons. Mutimir, the eldest, sought supreme leadership of the Serbian throne; as the co-ruling younger brothers, Strojimir and Gojnik, resisted, he had them captured and exiled to Bulgaria, where they were most likely held as hostages at the Bulgarian court at Pliska, after 855/856. According to V. ƒÜoroviƒá, Boris wanted to gain influence on these events in Serbia and sought to help those who could stand on the Bulgarian side instead of the Byzantine, and thus he graciously received the two younger brothers, holding them as weapons for his needs. Evidence of this is the fact that Boris himself chose a Bulgarian noblewoman to marry Strojimir's son, Klonimir. It seems that the exiled families were treated well in Bulgaria, with respect to their status. Mutimir had not exiled all members of his brother's families, but had retained his nephew Petar, the son of Gojnik, at the Serbian court for political reasons, although Petar later feared his father's fate and eventually escaped across the western border to Croatia. The descendants of Vlastimir's sons continued to fight for the throne over the century. An important event was the Christianization of the Serbs which began in 870, accompanied by strong political and cultural influences from the Byzantine Empire. After Mutimir's death in 890 or 891, the rule of Serbia was inherited by Mutimir's three sons Pribislav, Bran and Stefan (called the Mutimiroviƒá), headed by the eldest son, Pribislav. However, Pribislav's reign only lasted less than a year, ending when his cousin Petar returned to Serbia from Croatia and won a battle against Pribislav. Petar acquired the Serbian throne in ca. 892. Mutimir's three sons then left Serbia for Croatia where they sought refuge and help. In ca. 894, Bran tried to oust Petar with Croatian help but was unsuccessful; he was captured and blinded (according to political mutilation culture). In ca. 896, Klonimir left Bulgaria and marched an army into Serbia, entering the Serbian city of Destinikon (, also spelled Destinika and ), with the intent of seizing the throne. This city's exact location is undetermined, as De Administrando Imperio only lists it as one of eight fortified cities (Œ∫Œ±œÉœÑœÅŒ±) of baptized Serbia (not counting those of the maritime Serbian principalities). Klonimir was likely supported by the Bulgarians, which shows that Petar had bad relations with Bulgaria. However, Klonimir was unsuccessful, and the powerful Petar slew him. A little while afterwards, Petar was recognized as the ruler of Serbia by Bulgarian Tsar Symeon, resulting in a twenty-year peace and alliance.  Aftermath  Seal of prince Strojimir of Serbia (late 9th century) Petar ruled at peace with the Bulgars, though he was probably not happy with his subordinate position, and may have dreamed of reasserting his independence. His situation and the succession wars of the three branches of Vlastimir's sons was to play a key part in the coming Bulgarian‚ÄìByzantine War. However, according to De Administrando Imperio, Petar would have ruled under the suzerainty of Leo VI. Klonimir's son, ƒåaslav, was sent with Bulgarian aid to conquer Serbia in 924. The Bulgarians tricked him and annexed Serbia, until ƒåaslav returned from exile in 927 after Symeon's death and asserted his rule over Serbia in a Byzantine alliance. On July 11, 2006, the Serbian government bought a Byzantine-styled seal in solid gold weighing 15,64 g, most likely belonging to Strojimir (Klonimir's father), at an auction in Munich. It was presumably crafted outside Byzantium, and has a Greek inscription (KE BOIŒò CTPOHMIP, \\"God Help Strojimir\\") and a patriarchal cross in the centre. It most likely dates to the second half of the 9th century, between 855/56 and 896, when Klonimir tried to take the Serbian throne.

Sweden (8282/78) was a case decided by the European Commission of Human Rights in 1980. Background In 1975, a Swedish newspaper published certain statements made in the course of lecture by a professor of theology, including that \\"Scientology in the most untruthful movement there is. It is the cholera of spiritual life. That is how dangerous it is\\". Request by the Church of Scientology to start proceedings against the publisher was rejected by the Supreme Court. Decision The commission declared the application inadmissible. Concerning Article 9 of the Convention (freedom of religion), it noted that the Commission does not exclude the possibility of criticism or 'agitation' against a church or religious group reaching such a level that it might endanger freedom of religion and where a tolerance of such behaviour by the authorities could engage State responsibility. However, the Commission does not consider that such an issue arises on the facts of the present case (Para. 5). Concerning Article 6 (access to court), the Commission reaffirmed that the right of an individual to protect his reputation can be regarded as a civil right protected by Article 6, but did not extend this protection to a group, when the national legislation didn't foresee that (Para. 19).

Totality was visible from the southern Pacific Ocean east of New Zealand to the Coquimbo Region in Chile and Central Argentina at sunset, with the maximum of 4 minutes 32 seconds visible from the Pacific Ocean. The Moon was only 2.4 days before perigee (Perigee on July 5, 2019), making it fairly large. Another solar eclipse occurred one lunar year after this eclipse, on June 21, 2020. A further total solar eclipse will cross this region of the Earth on December 14, 2020. Images Visibility A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide. Following the North American solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, Astronomers Without Borders collected eclipse glasses for redistribution to Latin America and Asia for the 2019 eclipses. Totality travelled over areas with low levels of humidity and light pollution, allowing for very good observations. Several major observatories experienced totality, including the European Southern Observatory. Oeno Island The first land surface and the only Pacific island from which totality would have been visible is Oeno Island, an uninhabited atoll in the Pitcairn Islands. Chile Totality was visible in a large portion of Coquimbo Region and small parts of Atacama Region. Cities in the path include La Serena and La Higuera. Approximately 300,000 people visited La Serena to view the event. Tickets to view the eclipse from the European Southern Observatory were sold for US$2000 each. Argentina Totality was visible in the provinces of San Juan, La Rioja, San Luis, C√≥rdoba, Santa Fe, and Buenos Aires. Cities in the path include San Juan and R√≠o Cuarto.. The path of the totality was finishing at the Samborombon Bay, where the eclipsed suunset was observed from San Clemente del Tuyu.

Its name comes from the village of Cottesmore where the hounds were kennelled. History Vanity Fair print titled \\"Cottesmore\\", showing Evan Hanbury MFH, 5 December 1906 The Cottesmore Hunt's origins may be traced back to 1666 when Viscount Lowther made the long journey by a road with his own pack of foxhounds from Lowther Castle in Westmorland to Fineshade Abbey in East Northamptonshire. The Lowther family sold their pack to the Earl of Gainsborough. From 1696 to 1779 there had been a joint arrangement between John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland, Master of the Belvoir, and the Earl of Gainsborough, Earl Cardigan, Lord Howe and Lord Gower, to hunt one pack on a shared basis in the huge area from Belvoir southwards into East Northamptonshire. Hounds were moved between three different kennels, including Cottesmore, each season. The Gainsborough family withdrew from this joint Hunt in 1732 and took 25 couple of hounds that began to hunt the country later known as the Cottesmore. In 1776 Tom Noel made an agreement with Hugo Meynell, first Master of the Quorn, known as the \\"Father of Foxhunting\\". They agreed on boundaries between the Quorn and the Gainsborough pack, kennelled at Cottesmore, that enabled both packs to draw numerous coverts, including those at Owston, Launde and Tilton, nowadays well inside the Cottesmore country. Sir William Lowther bought the pack from the Gainsboroughs and hunted the Cottesmore country from 1788 until 1802 when he became Viscount Lowther. At first he rented Stocken Hall, but later rented Cottesmore House where he kennelled the hounds, and from which the pack derived its permanent name. Lowther made the Cottesmore Hunt more widely popular. \\"Earl William\\" and his staff wore hairy flat-topped hats, and it is believed R. S. Surtees depicted them as \\"The Flat Hat Hunt\\", with Lord Scamperdale as Master, in Mr Sponge's Sporting Tour. The Cottesmore pack was purchased from the new Viscount Lowther in 1802 by Sir Gilbert Heathcote, 4th Baronet of Normanton Park. He employed the celebrated horse-breaker Dick Christian as whipper-in. However, after only four years, William Lowther, the new Earl Lonsdale resumed his Mastership, and continuing in office for another 36 years. Sir Richard Sutton (master of the Cottesmore Hunt from 1842 to 1847), Henley Greaves (1847-1852) and Sir John Trollope (1855-1870) provided a series of shorter Masterships up to 1870 when the Lowthers returned again. During this time a large part of the country up to Whissendine was loaned to Mr Tailby of Skeffington who, with his own pack, hunted much of the country that later became the Fernie. Col. Henry Lowther, second son of the second Earl Lonsdale, became Master in 1870. Henry Lowther bought hounds from Tailby for ¬£1,300. Henry lived at Asfordby before moving to Barleythorpe Hall, near Oakham, which his father purchased for him as a hunting box. Henry, who became 3rd Earl Lonsdale, built lavish kennels and stables at Barleythorpe from 1872. New kennels and stables were built at Langham, completed in 1889. The buildings were intended to accommodate 100 couple of hounds, 50 horses, and housed most of the Hunt staff of some 40 grooms and kennelmen. The hunt's kennels moved to premises in Ashwell parish in 2004 when the former kennels were developed for housing, called Kimball Close after Marcus Kimball, Baron Kimball, former MFH. Three Hunt-class warships of the Royal Navy have been named after the hunt. Country The Cottesmore country extends 18 miles north to south and 22 miles east to west and lies mostly in Rutland, together with some smaller areas of Leicestershire and Lincolnshire. Its country converges with that of its neighbours the Quorn and the Belvoir (Duke of Rutland‚Äôs) in Melton Mowbray which in its heyday was a magnet for foxhunters worldwide and now has the UK's only foxhunting museum. Notable locations within the hunt's country in 1884 included Barleythorpe Hall, Knossington Grange, Burley Park and the town of Oakham.All featured on 1884 illustration \\"Hunting centres - the Cottesmore\\", published in Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News, 29 November 1884 After the Hunting Act Although \\"hunting wild mammals with a dog\\" was made unlawful in England and Wales by the Hunting Act 2004, which came into effect in 2005,Hunting Act 2004 , text online at opsi.gov.uk a number of exemptions stated in Schedule 1 of the 2004 Act permit some previously unusual forms of hunting wild mammals with dogs to continue, such as \\"hunting... for the purpose of enabling a bird of prey to hunt the wild mammal\\".Stephen Moss, The banned rode on: Eighteen months ago hunting was banned.

Biography Born in London in 1935, Legg was educated at Horace Mann School in New York City, and Frensham Heights School in the UK. After National Service in the Royal Marines, under the military education system he read history and law at St John's College, Cambridge. Career Legg was called to the Bar in 1960, one of the 12 lawyers allocated to the Lord Chancellor‚Äôs Department from 1962. He worked in the department for his entire career, which when he retired was responsible for administration of the UK legal system, and its co-ordination with European Union law, had resulted in the Department of Constitutional Affairs employing 20,00 staff and a budget of ¬£2 billion. In 1989 he became permanent secretary and Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, until 1998. A Master of the Bench of the Inner Temple since 1984, he was made an honorary Queen's Counsel in 1990. Inquiries Since his retirement from the Civil Service in 1998, Legg has headed three key inquiries for the government. In 1998, then Cabinet Secretary Sir Robin Butler asked Legg and Sir Robin Ibbs to conduct an inquiry into allegations that British company Sandline International was trying to sell arms to the government in exile in Sierra Leone, contravening an international embargo. In what became known as the \\"arms to Sierra Leone\\" affair, the inquiry cleared the British Government of any underhand conspiracy with Sandline, prompting accusations of a whitewash. In 2000 he carried out a parliamentary inquiry into the huge over-spend on Portcullis House, but his report was not published. As a member of the Audit Commission, and member of the House of Commons Audit Committee, in 2009, in the wake of the United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal, Legg was appointed to chair an independent panel with a remit to examine all claims relating to the second homes allowance between 2004‚Äì08. Other positions held Since retirement, Legg has held: the chairmanship of the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust; served as chairman of the London Library; served as consultant to the law firm of Clifford Chance.

Leslie Adams Harrison Leslie Adams, Jr. (born December 30, 1932 in Cleveland, Ohio) is an American composer. His works have been performed by the Prague Radio Symphony, Iceland Symphony, Buffalo Philharmonic, and Indianapolis Symphony, and commissioned by The Cleveland Orchestra, Ohio Chamber Orchestra and Cleveland Chamber Symphony, among others. Metropolitan Opera artists have performed his vocal works internationally. Adams is best known for writing music for voice (including choral music, art songs, vocal solos, and music drama) but has also written numerous purely instrumental compositions as well. Adams's music is composed largely within the tradition of Western classical music and also incorporates elements unique to African- American music. He is listed in New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd ed.; International Who's Who in Music and Musicians; Wikipedia Encyclopedia; and Who's Who in America. Biography Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Adams earned a Bachelor of Music Education from Oberlin College in 1955, a Master of Music from California State University, Long Beach in 1967, and a Ph.D in Music from Ohio State University in 1973. He also pursued private studies with Leon Dallin, Herbert Elwell, Joseph R. Wood, Vittorio Giannini, Robert Starer and Eugene O'Brien. He received composer residency fellowships from the Rockefeller Foundation (Bellagio, Italy, 1979) and Yaddo Artist Residence (Saratoga Springs, New York, 1980 and 1984). Adams's music drama Blake (composed 1986) was the focus of a significant portion of Y.C. Williams's New Perspectives on Music (ed. J. Wright with S.A. Floyd Jr, published Warren, MI, 1992, pages 172‚Äì209). This music drama is very loosely based on Martin Delaney's novel Blake; or, The Huts of America, which is about the lives of African-American slaves on the eve of the civil war. The work incorporates many elements of African-American music, such as syncopated rhythms, melodies reminiscent of spiritual and gospel music, and an improvised percussion passage in the style of Afro-Cubano.

Goldner and Frank Harary, who proved in 1975 that it was the smallest non- Hamiltonian maximal planar graph.. See also the same journal 6(2):33 (1975) and 8:104-106 (1977). Reference from listing of Harary's publications... The same graph had already been given as an example of a non-Hamiltonian simplicial polyhedron by Branko Gr√ºnbaum in 1967. Properties The Goldner‚ÄìHarary graph is a planar graph: it can be drawn in the plane with none of its edges crossing. When drawn on a plane, all its faces are triangular, making it a maximal planar graph. As with every maximal planar graph, it is also 3-vertex-connected: the removal of any two of its vertices leaves a connected subgraph. The Goldner‚ÄìHarary graph is also non-hamiltonian. The smallest possible number of vertices for a non-hamiltonian polyhedral graph is 11. Therefore, the Goldner‚ÄìHarary graph is a minimal example of graphs of this type. However, the Herschel graph, another non-Hamiltonian polyhedron with 11 vertices, has fewer edges. As a non-Hamiltonian maximal planar graph, the Goldner‚ÄìHarary graph provides an example of a planar graph with book thickness greater than two.. See in particular Figure 9. Based on the existence of such examples, Bernhart and Kainen conjectured that the book thickness of planar graphs could be made arbitrarily large, but it was subsequently shown that all planar graphs have book thickness at most four.. It has book thickness 3, chromatic number 4, chromatic index 8, girth 3, radius 2, diameter 2 and is a 3-edge-connected graph. It is also a 3-tree, and therefore it has treewidth 3. Like any k-tree, it is a chordal graph. As a planar 3-tree, it forms an example of an Apollonian network. Geometry By Steinitz's theorem, the Goldner‚ÄìHarary graph is a polyhedral graph: it is planar and 3-connected, so there exists a convex polyhedron having the Goldner‚ÄìHarary graph as its skeleton. Geometrically, a polyhedron representing the Goldner‚ÄìHarary graph may be formed by gluing a tetrahedron onto each face of a triangular dipyramid, similarly to the way a triakis octahedron is formed by gluing a tetrahedron onto each face of an octahedron. That is, it is the Kleetope of the triangular dipyramid.. Same page, 2nd ed., Graduate Texts in Mathematics 221, Springer-Verlag, 2003, .. The dual graph of the Goldner‚ÄìHarary graph is represented geometrically by the truncation of the triangular prism. Algebraic properties The automorphism group of the Goldner‚ÄìHarary graph is of order 12 and is isomorphic to the dihedral group D6, the group of symmetries of a regular hexagon, including both rotations and reflections. The characteristic polynomial of the Goldner‚ÄìHarary graph is : -(x-1)^2 x^2 (x+2)^3 (x^2-3) (x^2-4 x-9).

Shipley, Encyclopedia of Literature, Volume 1, Read Books, 2007, p271  Early years  Mait Metsanurk was born as the youngest of eight children in a peasant family in Saare farmstead, Metsanuka, Tartu County. He attended elementary school in Orge and a Russian-speaking city school in Tartu. He then worked in various position, first as an office clerk, then as a schoolteacher and from 1906 as a journalist. He is buried at the Metsakalmistu cemetery in Tallinn.  Career  \\"Portrait of Mait Metsanurk\\" by Nikolai Triik, 1929. Mait Metsanurk reached his literary breakthrough in 1908 with realistic portrayal of Estonian town and country living at the time. In particular, the social contradictions and tensions were used in his work. Mait Metsanurk became one of the most prolific and popular writer and playwright of his era. Together with Anton Hansen Tammsaare (1878‚Äì1940), he is considered one of the most outstanding representatives of Estonian neo-realism of the interwar period.Kevin O'Connor, Culture and customs of the Baltic states, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006, p128 His main work, the historical novel √úmera j√µel (On the √úmera River) (1934), depicts the struggle of the pagan Estonians against the Danish and German conquest in the thirteenth century. In addition, he worked as a literary critic and translator. In 1924/25 and from 1930 to 1936 Mait Metsanurk was chairman of the Estonian Writers' Union. With the Soviet occupation of Estonia Mait Metsanurk was sidelined politically and expelled from the Writers' Union. Mait Metsanurk was rehabilitated in 1956, after the death of Stalin.

The creation of the Tibetan script is traditionally attributed to Thonmi Sambhota who is said to have been sent to India early in the reign of Songsten Gampo where he devised an alphabet suitable for the Tibetan language by adapting elements of Indian scripts.Ancient Tibet (1986), pp. 189-192. The pillar was erected during the reign of the early Tibetan emperor, Trisong Detsen (755 until 797 or 804 CE) in the village of Zhol (which has disappeared because of recent construction), which stood just before the Potala Palace. It was commissioned by the powerful minister Nganlam Takdra Lukhong, generally considered an opponent of Buddhism. The inscription The inscription starts off by announcing that Nganlam Takdra Lukhong had been appointed Great Inner Minister and Great Yo-gal 'chos- pa (a title difficult to translate). It goes on to say that Klu-khong brought to Trisong Detsen the facts of the murder of his father, Me Agtsom (704-754) by two of his Great Ministers, 'Bal Ldong-tsab and LangMyes-zigs, and that they intended to harm him also. They were then condemned and Klu-kong was appointed Inner Minister of the Royal Council.Richardson (1985), pp. 7, 9. It then gives an account of his services to the king including campaigns against Tang China which culminated in the brief capture of the Chinese capital Chang'an (modern Xi'an) in 763 CESnellgrove and Richardson (1995), p. 91. during which the Tibetans temporarily installed as Emperor a relative of Princess Jincheng Gongzhu (Kim-sheng Kong co), the Chinese wife of Trisong Detsen's father, Me Agtsom.Richardson (1984), p. 30.Beckwith (1987), p. 148. It is a testament to the generally tolerant attitude of Tibetan culture that this proud memorial by a subject was allowed to stand after the re- establishment of Buddhism under Trisong Detsen and has survived until modern times. Other information about the pillar Traditionally among the celebrations for Tibetan New Year, or Losar, a team of sportsmen, usually from Shigatse, would perform daredevil feats such as sliding down a rope from the top of the highest roof of the Potala, to the Zhol Pillar at the foot of the hill. However, the 13th Dalai Lama banned this performance because it was dangerous and sometimes even fatal. As of 1993 the pillar was fenced off so it could not be approached closely (see accompanying photo).

It encourages: (1) Reducing human exposure to hazardous chemicals; and (2) for organizations to develop ‚Äògreen chemistry‚Äô to substitute chemicals with bad ‚ÄòPBT‚Äô profiles ‚Äì Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity. The CPES website , provides readers with news and information on, cancer incidence rates in the United Kingdom, environmental contaminants linked with disease, key studies and links to other similar organisations. History The Society was set up in response to the increasing scientific literature revealing links between chemicals and disease. It was felt that whilst other charities were covering research, patient care, diet and smoking, there was little being done to inform the medical community about the Public Health implications of human exposure to chemicals; this rationale was bolstered by the knowledge that pharmaceuticals are highly evaluated and regulated whereas many synthetic chemicals are not. Research CPES monitors the news for new research on Environmental Health. In 2005 it supported a review of the medical and scientific literature by Newby & Howard Environmental influences in cancer aetiology: https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q;=cache:-Wsi_OVDP1cJ:healthandenvironment.org/%3Fmodule%3Duploads%26func%3Ddownload%26fileId%3D242+environmental+influences+in+cancer+aetiology&hl;=en‚â∑=uk&pid;=bl&srcid;=ADGEEShpM3pmohXXVeYgFcfQSOn3rrItEnbPPM4Ow5y7ebwuNhafrGQD04knfbLw4QMEryLGy- OzBmpfjpF0EnBTGGjbbGkL6gd3mE1ByUq-0r0UoAsEsDg2ZxmSCevJ31LPHPV- kRwy&sig;=AHIEtbQpqOBwvsJP3jgFcgECakHXFpxFGg at the University of Liverpool on environmental causes of cancer. In addition, the charity also helped to fund a study, which utilised the Cancer Incidence Temporality Index, the development of which was also part-funded by the CPES.Cancer Prevention and Education Society funded research: http://www.cancerpreventionsociety.org/importantStudies.htm Information services The Charity provides information to doctors and healthcare professionals, the scientific community, and the general public. News and scientific studies about Environmental health are collated on its website. It also produces a free subscription e-publication Health and Environment providing an easy way to stay up-to-date on developments in environmental health issues and what they mean for health and healthcare.e-publication Health and Environment: http://healthandenvironmentonline.com/about/ Influencing public policy The charity works hard to promote prevention as a way of reducing cancer and other diseases. It sees the success of reducing lung cancer by smoking cessation programmes as a text book example of how prevention can work effectively. It would like to see healthcare professionals advocating for the reduction of human exposure to hazardous agents found in pesticides, consumer products, the home & work place, and pollution. It sees as ‚Äòrole models‚Äô the work of the Canadian Cancer SocietyThe work of the Canadian Cancer Society regarding environmental contaminants: http://www.cancer.ca/canada- wide/prevention/specific%20environmental%20contaminants.aspx?sc_lang=en and the resolution of the American Medical Association to ‚Äòencourage the training of medical students, physicians and other health professionals on the human health effects of toxic chemical exposures‚Äô.The resolution of the American Medical Association to ‚Äòencourage the training of medical students, physicians and other health professionals on the human health effects of toxic chemical exposures‚Äô: http://www.ama- assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/471/refcomhighlights.pdf Fundraising The Charity depends on individual donors to support its work.

Life He was a native of Somerset. He was admitted a scholar of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, 10 March 1528, was elected a probationer fellow there on 13 October 1531, and two years later a full fellow. He graduated M.A. in 1534, B.D. in 1542, and D.D. in 1546,Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Chaffey-Chivers having about that time subscribed the thirty-four articles. He became chaplain to Edmund Bonner, bishop of London, who collated him on 9 July 1548 to the prebend of Twyford in St Paul's Cathedral. In 1549 he distinguished himself in a public disputation with Peter Martyr, held in the divinity school at Oxford. After the disgrace of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset Chedsey inveighed openly at Oxford against the reformed doctrines, and in consequence was, by an order in council of 10 March 1551, committed to the Marshalsea for seditious preaching; he was imprisoned till 11 November 1551, when he was moved to the house of Thomas Goodrich, Bishop of Ely. On the accession of Queen Mary he regained his liberty and received several marks of royal favour. He was presented by the queen to the living of All Saints, Bread Street, London; a few days later Bonner collated him to the prebend of Chiswick in St Paul's; and by letters patent, dated 4 October the same year, he was appointed a canon of the collegiate chapel of St. George at Windsor. On 28 November 1554 the lord mayor and aldermen in scarlet, and the commons in their liveries, assembled in St. Paul's, where Chedsey preached in the presence of the Bishop of London and nine other prelates, and read a letter from the queen's council, directing the Bishop of London to cause Te Deum' to be sung in all the churches of his diocese, with continual prayers for the queen, who had conceived. On 10 October 1556 he was collated to the archdeaconry of Middlesex, and by letters patent, 18 June 1557, he was nominated by the king and queen to a canonry of Christ Church, Oxford. In 1558 he was preoccupied in heresy-hunting, and was admitted to the vicarage of Shottesbrooke, then in the diocese of Salisbury, on the presentation of King Philip and Queen Mary. He was admitted President of Corpus Christi College on 15 September 1558; but he was removed next year by the commissioners sent by Queen Elizabeth to visit the university. In 1559 he was one of the Catholic divines who were summoned to the Westminster Conference to dispute with an equal number of Protestants before an assembly of the nobility. At length he was deprived of all his preferments as a recusant, and was to the Fleet Prison in London. He appears to have been living in 1574.

A former student of \\"Kowboy\\" Mike Hughes, he was one of several Kardinal Sinner Wrestling School graduates to be featured in the Canadian television documentary series Wrestling Reality. The series not only covered his time on the road but also his performance as the 3rd annual Maritime Cup tournament where he wrestled in the main event to crown the first Wrestling Reality heavyweight champion. Jessome has also been an instructor in \\"boot camps\\" for the Kardinal Sinner wrestling school. Biography Real Action Wrestling (2001-2002) Gary Jessome was born in North Sydney, Nova Scotia on November 7, 1978. He was working in Moncton, New Brunswick when he met Kingman and was invited to train at his Kardinal Sinners Wrestling School with himself and co-owner \\"Kowboy\\" Mike Hughes. Having a lifelong interest in weightlifting and bodybuilding, Jessome accepted and they soon began traveling to the Johnstons River area in Prince Edward Island where he and Kingman worked out in a barn while Mike Hughes taught him ring psychology and technical ability. He suffered numerous injuries during his time at the Kardinal Sinners \\"boot camp\\" including a concussion, whiplash, bruised kidneys, heels and tail bone. By the time of his graduation in 2001, Jessome was considered one of their top students and was later brought back to the school as a part-time trainer. Jessome has claimed that Kingman heavily influenced his career and wrestling style. He made his debut match in Hughes' Real Action Wrestling against fellow student and training partner Downtown Ray Brown in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island on February 27, 2001. In April, Jessome joined one of the promotion's earliest Maritime tours which included Kingman, Mike Hughes, Larry Destiny, Bill Skullion, Notorious T.I.D., Rogue, Buddy Lane, Bobby Rude and Kurrgan. Joe E. Legend, Chi Chi Cruz and Wildman Austin also joined later on. He would also have a series of matches against Buddy Lane in the next three months, most of which he lost, before scoring his first major victory against Corporal Chaos in Irishtown, New Brunswick on May 2. That same month, he faced Bill Skullion twice in two \\"hardcore matches\\" as well as losing another match to the Acadian Giant. He feuded with Massive Damage during the summer, also facing him in hardcore matches, as well as teaming with Eddie Watts to defeat Flesh Gordon & Custom Made Man in a tag team match in his hometown of North Sydney on August 12. Jessome would face both Custom Made Man and Watts in a singles matches during the next few weeks. On August 20 in Cocagne, New Brunswick, MacIsaac fought and lost two matches in one night losing to Custom Made Man and Massive Damage. He would also lose to Chi Chi Cruz and Custom Made Man in singles matches several times over the next few weeks. Returning to Cocagne on September 3, Jessome again teamed with Eddie Watts but lost to Flesh Gordon & Massive Damage. Two weeks later, he joined his rival Custom Made Man in a tag team match to defeat his former trainers Mike Hughes & Kingman in Sydney, Nova Scotia on September 16. A month later, a match between him and Flesh Gordon turned into a tag team match between him and Otto Bahn against Gordon & Buddy Lane. On October 20, he faced Custom Made Man in a \\"Scottish Pub match\\" in Halifax. He also wrestled Stephen Pettipas in Halifax on November 24, 2001, losing to him via disqualification. Jessome became close friends with several wrestlers while touring with RAW among these being Lincoln Steen who claimed he was a practical joker. He once joked during an interview about learning \\"a great deal of invaluable lessons while on the road with them, things like don't trust Duke MacIsaac with a sharpie if you pass out in Mike Hughes‚Äô van.\\" In late-2001, Jessome injured his knee and remained out of action for several months. When RAW resumed operations early the following year, Jessome was one of the main stars to rejoin the promotion. Real Action Wrestling and the independents (2002-2003) He made his return match defeating Cinder in Halifax on May 4, 2002. A week later in North Sydney, he and Chi Chi Cruz lost to Gary Williams & Eddie Watts. Jessome won a number of single matches against Scott Savage, Aaron Idol and Johnny Wiseguy throughout the summer. One of these was a handicap match against Scott Savage & Trash Kanyon in Kentville, Nova Scotia held on June 5. He lost to Gary Williams in a \\"street fight\\" match in Louisdale three days later, and on several other occasions as well, but did score impressive victories over Mike Hughes; one of these occurred on the promotion's first television taping in Halifax on June 17. Later on, he rescued valet Rachel Bulman from the abusive Johnny Wise Guy. Although he lost to Hughes in a rematch the following night in O'Leary, Prince Edward Island, Jessome also won a battle royal at the same event. He would also defeat Hughes in subsequent rematches during the next two days as well as picking up wins against Remington Steen and Vance Nevada before losing to Bobby Rude in a table match in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island on July 23. He would also feud with Johnny Wise Guy over Rachel defeating him in both singles and mixed tag team matches against Johnny Wise Guy & \\"Sweet\\" Sarah Stock including one at a Halifax television taping on July 29. Shortly after this last appearance, the promotion closed down permanently. He made an appearance for Bobby Bass' All Canadian Wrestling defeating Flesh Gordon in Charlo, New Brunswick on August 23, 2002, and remained in the Maritimes finding work in Grand Prix Wrestling and later East Coast Pro Wrestling. A contender for the ECPW Heavyweight Championship in 2003, he failed to become its first champion, but eventually won the title from Kingman two years later. The Maritime Cup and Wrestling With Reality (2003-2006) On October 12, 2003, Jessome took part in the 1st annual Maritime Cup tournament at the Halifax Forum losing to Mike Hughes in the opening rounds. The event, which featured Bobby Roode, Lincoln Steen, Scott Savage, Gary Williams, Sonny Roselli and \\"The Future\\" Tony Armstrong, was a huge success and later released on VHS/DVD. In 2004, Jessome was one of the instructors at the Kardinal Sinners \\"boot camp\\". He was later critical of the typical wrestling student which he characterized \\"as a mix [of] \\"It's cool to act tough guys\\" to \\"I'm great because my Mom tells me so\\". He later helped promote Gary Williams' newly opened wrestling school in Halifax and said in one interview \\"If there is anything I could say about this school is that anyone who is seriously wanting to be trained should take action and reap the rewards of learning from a great Maritime legend\\". By the time of the 2nd annual Maritime Cup in Kentville, Nova Scotia, Jessome was considered the tournament favorite. There was a slight alteration to this version as it would be closed to wrestlers outside the Maritime provinces so as to showcase top talent in the region. Although the tournament's concept was created by Kingman and Trash Canyon, but Jessome and Gary Williams were also credited for helping with its development. Earlier that year, they had met Sarah Dunsworth, star of the TV comedy Trailer Park Boys, at her Barrington Street store Junk and Foibles which was a popular spot for local wrestler to purchase costumes and similar items. They initially were interested in using Bubbles from Trailer Park Boys to make a guest appearance at their wrestling show in Moncton but eventually involved her as director in a new television documentary series entitled \\"Wrestling With Reality\\". The series would follow themselves around the Canadian independent circuit and the planned Maritime Cup. Dunsworth would also help finance and promote the show. Jessome defeated Vinny Glyde, Trash Canyon and Gary Williams advancing to the finals where he lost to Kingman. Sarah Dunsworth appeared in the corner of Trash Canyon during the tournament, but after he lost to Jessome in the second round, Canyon shoved her to the ground blaming Dunsworth for the loss. She was rescued by Jessome, who attacked Canyon, and remained with him for the rest of the tournament. His final match against Kingman was marred by the \\"heel turn\\" of Bobby Roode, then acting special guest referee, who hit Jessome with a steel chair then allowed Kingman to score the pinfall. The Maritime Cup was awarded to winner, as was the ECPW Heavyweight title, but Kingman instead smashed the cup on the round and walked off with his Kardinal Sinners stablemates. Jessome avenged his loss days later winning a battle royal to gain a match against Kingman and defeating him via disqualification. The next night in North Sydney, he defeated Kingman to win the ECPW Heavyweight Championship. He also took part in a three-day tour of Eastern Canada with Grand Prix Wrestling visiting Petit Rocher, New Brunswick, New Carlisle, Quebec and Borden, Prince Edward Island. Also featured were The Cuban Assassin, Gary Williams, Spiderman, Ryan Storm and Jeff Dupre. On November 26, 2005 in Canning, Nova Scotia, Jessome appeared in the main event in a best 2 out of 3 falls match with Lincoln Steen against Brody Steele and Gary Williams. Buddy Lane was the special guest referee.Doyle, Rick. \\"Updates: November 26, 05.\\" Welcome To The Online Home Of Wrestling With Reality Star Trash Canyon, 26 Nov. 2005. Web. 12 Oct. 2009 . The series finale took place at the 3rd annual Maritime Cup tournament at the Halifax Forum on June 2, 2006. Although not featured in the tournament itself, Jessome took part in the semi-main event pitting he and Trash Canyon in a tag team elimination match against Gary Williams & Bobby Roode. Williams would go on to beat Roode to become the first \\"Wrestling With Reality\\" Heavyweight Champion. The special referee was Buddy Lane. On August 18, 2006, the \\"Wrestling With Reality\\" tour returned to the Halifax Forum where Jessome wrestled Tony Armstrong to determine the number one contender to the heavyweight title. Following a television taping during the tour, Jessome appeared with Kingman, Trash Canyon and others at an afterparty celebration at the Dresden Row nightclub, The Speakeasy, which also featured rock band Dogbite and performances by Pink Velvet Burlesque. Recent years (2006-2007) In late 2006, Jessome joined Brody Steele, Chad Collyer and Gangrel and other Canadian wrestlers for a three-month tour of the United Kingdom with All Star Wrestling. He was unable to rejoin the \\"Wrestling with Reality\\" tour when it resumed early the next year and, shortly after returning to Canada, relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia. On May 26, 2007, he and Johnny Obsession lost to Mauler and Barry Goode at the Wrestling‚Äôs Hero‚Äôs and Villains supercard in Cloverdale, British Columbia. Afterwards, he and several other wrestlers, including Monster Pro Wrestling's Heavy Metal, spent several hours at the Citrus bar. On September 15, 2007, Jessome participated in a special fundraiser for the Special Olympics in Comox, British Columbia. At the event, he lost to Disco Fury but later went on to win the main event, a 15-man battle royal, to be awarded the Taco Del Mar-sponsored \\"Carlos Cup\\". On September 25, he defended the ECPW Heavyweight Championship in a triple threat match against Bobby Roode and \\"Kowboy\\" Mike Hughes. Former World Wrestling Federation veteran Tito Santana also made an appearance at the event. Both Santana and himself were quoted by the Cape Breton Post voicing their criticism towards steroid abuse in professional wrestling. Jessome said \\"I've got size and technical abilities, plus I love to entertain a crowd, so I think that's enough for me. To put your health at risk just to do something like that, that's not acceptable.\\" After a two-year reign, he finally lost the ECPW Heavyweight Championship to Mike Hughes in North Sydney on September 30, 2007.

It was directed by Ry≈çsuke Takahashi, with mechanical design by Kunio Okawara and Yutaka Izubuchi. Plot Set in a far flung medieval-looking world of Arst, Prince Jordy Volder takes up the fight against the ambitions of the conqueror Marder. Jordy uses the legendary giant robot \\"panzer\\" Galient, which is one of many panzers that have been preserved underground for thousands of years. Using an army of advanced robot panzers, Marder is conquering all of Arst in preparation of his plan for dominance of the Crescent Galaxy. Theme music *Opening Theme - \\"The Galient World\\"-Run for your life by EUROX *Ending Theme - \\"Hoshi No Ichibyou\\" (\\"A second of a star\\") by EUROX The show's opening and ending musical themes were composed and performed by EUROX, a Japanese progressive rock band formed in 1984 in Tokyo, Japan. They also did English versions of both songs which have quite different lyrics from the Japanese ones. They also did a 2009 remake of both songs in both languages. The ending theme of the show was normally accompanied by nighttime shots of a sword stuck in the sand and images of the characters reflected on its blade as the credits flash on screen with the ending showing the same sword now being showered with rain (as reference to a line in the song about crying). The final episode was different, with a tighter daylight shot on the sword that pans up to the handle. Prince Jordy's hand then pulls the sword from the sand and lifts it up in the air and we see him embracing Chururu. The credits flash onscreen as the Prince and Chururu look at each other as the images of the prince's mother and friends appear onscreen with rose petals blowing in the wind completing the ending.

Its motto is ('The love Christ urges us on'; ). The institute has its headquarters in Dublin. The congregation is governed by a congregational leader, assisted by a group of sisters known as the general leadership team or the general council. In England and Scotland, it operates as a registered charity. The Religious Sisters of Charity of Australia is constituted as a distinct Congregation. History The religious institute was founded by Mary Frances Aikenhead (1787‚Äì1858) who opened its first convent in Dublin in 1815. In 1834 St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin was set up by Mary Aikenhead (the first hospital staffed by nuns in the English-speaking world). In 1838 five sisters arrived in Australia ‚Äî the first religious women to set foot on Australian soil ‚Äî and later opened a convent in Parramatta. Since 1842 the Australian congregation has operated independently. The sisters arrived in England in 1840. They first came to Birkenhead in 1900. As of 2020, most of the sisters in residence are involved in parish ministry. The provincial house is in Acton, London. In 1845, Mother Aikenhead had been advised for health reasons to move to the country. She purchased ‚ÄúGreenmount‚Äù, a late 18th century house at Harold‚Äôs Cross. Renamed \\"Our Lady‚Äôs Mount\\", it became the motherhouse of the congregation, housing the novitiate and a school. In 1879, the motherhouse was moved to Mount St. Anne's in Milltown. The Sisters operate a heritage centre within the grounds of Our Lady's Hospice, Harold's Cross, Dublin. Ministry In addition to the traditional three vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, the Religious Sisters of Charity take a fourth vow: to devote their lives to the service of the poor.\\"Mary Aikenhead\\", Mary Aikenhead Ministries The community is active in Ireland, England, Scotland, Australia, California, Nigeria, Zambia and Malawi, serving in health care, education, pastoral and social work, catechesis, home visitation, home for the handicapped and adult education.

Hospice work * When the congregation's motherhouse moved to Mount St. Anne's in 1879, the sisters opened Our Lady's Hospice at Harold's Cross, pioneering the modern hospice movement under superior, Anna Gaynor. By the following year, it had a capacity of forty beds.\\"Our Heritage\\", Our Lady's Hospice & Care Services **In December 2003, Our Lady's Hospice opened a satellite unit for specialist palliative care in Blackrock, Co.

In August 1939, St. Joseph‚Äôs Hospice was taken over as an Air Raid Casualty Station and the patients moved to a nursing home in Bath. In 1952, Cicely Saunders, a pioneer in palliative care came to work at St. Joseph's, where she would remain for seven years, researching pain control. The hospice subsequently became a limited company and took over the convent for additional space, while St. Joseph's Convent was relocated to a new building on the grounds with a dedicated care component.Religious Sisters of Charity -English/Scottish Province * The community expanded its work to Scotland in 1948, and two years later opened St. Margaret's Hospice in Clydebank. Due to increased demand, in September 1971 a new St. Margaret of Scotland Hospice, with a sixty bed capacity was opened nearby. That too has subsequently been expanded.\\"History\\", St. Margaret of Scotland Hospice * In 1957, at the request of Bishop James Scanlan of Motherwell, four sisters, with the assistance of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul established a Nursing Home for the frail elderly and terminally ill at Assumption House in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire. Initially providing thirteen beds, by 1965 it accommodated twenty-one. By the end of the 1970s it became apparent that much of the space was occupied by long-term elderly patients, to the almost the complete exclusion of the terminally ill. Additional space was needed, and as Assumption House required significant repair, the sisters arranged to take over the former St. Margaret's School. St. Andrew's Hospice opened in 1986 with a capacity for thirty beds; an extension was added in 2006 for offices and administration.\\"History\\", St. Andrew's Hospice In 1892 Agnes Bernard of the Sisters of Charity started a convent and woollen mill in Foxford in County Mayo. The woollen mills are still (2017) an important employer. Controversy The Sisters of Charity is one of 18 religious congregations which managed residential institutions for children investigated by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, and was party to the 2002, ‚Ç¨128-million indemnity agreement with the Republic of Ireland State. The Commission's work started in 1999 and it published its public report, commonly referred to as the Ryan report, on 20 May 2009. Following publication of the Ryan report in 2009 the Sisters of Charity offered to contribute a further ‚Ç¨5 million towards the ‚Ç¨1.5 billion redress costs incurred by the State involving former residents of the institutions. As of 2017, the Sisters of Charity had contributed just ‚Ç¨2 million of their 2009 offer. The Sisters of Charity congregation has also to complete its contribution to the 2002 indemnity agreement. It owns one of 11 properties yet to be transferred to the State before terms of the 2002 agreement are fulfilled. Magdalene asylums The Religious Sisters of Charity were one the organisations that ran Magdalene Laundries in Ireland. These institutions operated from the 18th to the late 20th centuries to house \\"fallen women\\". In 1993, a mass grave containing 155 corpses was uncovered in the convent grounds of one of the former laundries in Dublin. The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child ultimately called for a government inquiry. A formal state apology was issued in 2013, and a ¬£50-60 million compensation scheme for survivors was set up. Neither the Catholic Church, nor the four religious institutes that ran the Irish asylums have as yet contributed to the survivor's fund, despite demands from the Irish government, and the United Nations Committee Against Torture.\\"Investigate Magdalen Abuses: UN\\", Irish Examiner, June 7, 2011 Senator Martin McAleese chaired an Inter-Departmental Committee to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalen Laundries.

The nearest hamlet is Preston just over to the south-west.  History  There has been a religious establishment at Bonkyl since the early 12th century, and it was part of the vicarage of Dunkeld before 1275. The early proprietor of the church was Sir Alexander de Bonkyl, but the church passed into the care of John Stewart who married Alexander's daughter. John was the son of Alexander Stewart, 4th High Steward of Scotland. During the Second War of Scottish Independence the location was contested by Thomas Ughtred, a future Knight of the Garter. The care and maintenance of the church then passed to the Douglas Earls of Angus, descendants of the Stewarts, before finally passing to the Earl of Home in 1877. The church was a separate parish until 1621 when it was co-joined with the nearby parish of Preston. In 1958, the churches were joined by Reston, then Chirnside in 1973. The present church is a Category B listed building. The ancient church at Bonkyl fell into ruin and was demolished in 1820 when the present church was built. All that is left of the old church is a Norman apse, a vaulted arch which was later used as a burial vault of the Homes of Billie.

Later in the year 1989 Lion's Club handed over the school to the public of Balangir and subsequently formed an executive managing committee who took charge of running the school.

It was used by the Greeks to create unity in the politics of classical Greece. It saw widespread use when Alexander the Great adopted its principles to govern his vast Empire. Interpretation Classical Greeks The concept of Homonoia was an ancient Greek concept which traditionally was not applied beyond their own culture. The Greeks viewed Homonoia as an absence of factional fighting in their city states. The Greeks viewed outside cultures as \\"barbarians\\". The famed scholar Aristotle once told his student, a young Alexander the Great, \\"treat Greeks as friends, but [non-Greeks] as animals.\\" It was the scholar Isocrates who first looked beyond the Greek people. While he didn't preach that the savages of the non-Greek world could be on par with the superior Greek people, he did believe they could be made Greek and thus be of one mind together. He claimed that Greekness could become a matter of nurture rather than nature.Low 2007, p. 62. It was during his time spent in the court of Philip II of Macedon that Isocrates was able to teach the concept to an influential audience. Philip II took much of the concept to heart, but he too viewed it as a method reserved for the Greeks. He used the concept as his driving force behind creating the Corinthian League, an alliance to unite the Greek States for a war against the Persian Empire. After Philip II was assassinated his son Alexander the Great became King of Macedonia and himself became a proponent of Homonoia. Alexander the Great Alexander's tutor, Aristotle, viewed non-Greeks as barbarian animals. Alexander however, ignored his teacher's indication and expanded on the concept of Homonoia. With an Empire covering most of the known world, Alexander sought to rule his subjects, whether they were Greek, Persian or Egyptian, under the concept of Homonoia. In his short time as ruler of his vast Empire he tried to adopt customs of the cultures he conquered such as Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of proskynesis, either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians paid to their social superiors.Arrian 1983, VII, 11. He also married the officers of his army to Persian wives in an effort to further create a sense of oneness in his new Empire.Tetlow 2005, p. 171. Through his policies he wanted to create a new Greco-Oriental empire as distinct from the more traditional system of a small ruling class of conquerors ruling over the recently vanquished. It was his practice to place the old style Persian satrap as governors but in the newly created offices of taxation and finance he placed Macedonians.Mauriac 1949, p. 108. After his death most of his reforms lived on even as the Empire fragmented into successor states. In the Romanized East Homonoia was extended under Roman rule in the highly urbanized East as a symbolic mechanism for dealing with intra-city tensions and for linking the sometimes intensely individual eastern city-states. A temple of Homonoia at Aphrodisias in Caria appears as the setting for the wedding of Callirhoe and Dionysios in the first-century CE romance Chaereas and Callirhoe; the temple is objectified in coinage of Aphrodisias that shows the cult statue of Aphrodite of Aphrodisias with those of other cities, under the legend homonoia: \\"Deities in the coin issues served as symbols that mediated the power within regional alliances, bolstered the prestige of the divine realm in human activity and provided the glue that bound together the political and the cosmic spheres.\\" and bibliography Edwards notes several examples of homonoia coinage. In the first century CE, the Greek rhetor Dio Chrysostom sought in one of his Discourses to establish homonoia between two cities that each claimed the sobriquet \\"first city\\", Nicaea and Nicopolis.Chrysostom 1939, 28.22 See also *Homonoia () Greek goddess of order and unity Bibliography ;Notes ;References * \\\\- Total pages: 608  * \\\\- Total pages: 313  \\\\- Total pages: 289 * \\\\- Total pages: 476 * \\\\- Total pages: 300 Category:Ethical schools and movements Category:Theories in ancient Greek philosophy Category:Political theories ","title":"Homonoia"},{"id":"24675606","text":"Harpalus or Harpalos () is a name reported by modern historical books (tertiary sources) as the engineer who built the pontoon bridge over the Hellespont (from Abydos to Sestos) for Xerxes in 480 BC.

The oldest and relevant source seems to be a work published in 1904 by Hermann Alexander Diels which he titled Laterculi Alexandrini (\\"Alexandrian lists\\"The word laterculus in Classical Latin means 'a brick', or 'a tile' or something of the sort, but in the early Middle Ages it came to mean a list ), out of a damaged 1st or 2nd- century BC papyrus he found, which lists artists and scientists by their achievements.The forgotten revolution: how science was born in 300 BC and Why it Had to Be Reborn by Lucio Russo Page 96 (2004) The tertiary sources report the following: One of Mandrocles' successors, not named by Herodotus (7.34-36), was Harpalos of Tenedos who, succeeding where Egyptian and Phoenician engineers had failed, built the bridge over the HellespontCommerce and Monetary Systems in the Ancient World. Page 204 (2004) (Hofstetter 1978, no. 130; on the bridge, see Hammond and Roseman 1996). It is important for a right estimate of Ionian science to remember the high development of engineering in these days. Mandrokles of Samos built the bridge over the Bosporos for King Dareios (Herod. iv. 88), and Harpalos of Tenedos bridged the Hellespont for Xerxes when the Egyptians and Phoenicians had failed in the attempt (Diels, Laterculi Alexandrini, Abh. der Berl.

Burlesque career Polly Jane Rae was born in Preston, Lancashire, England. Polly's burlesque career began in 2006, after seeing a poster for a burlesque course run by Jo King and the London Academy of Burlesque at Danceworks studios. She attended the course and completely inspired by Jo and her teachings she decided to form her seven girl troupe Hurly Burly (including herself). Taking creative inspiration from 1940s and 1950s pin-ups such as Bettie Page, Tempest Storm and Marilyn Monroe to modern artists like Madonna and revue shows such as Le Crazy Horse in Paris, their first show was held at the Soho Revue Bar (formerly the Raymond Revue Bar) in Soho in 2006. It was such a success that it led to a residency at the bar, another residency at Volupte (a burlesque supper club in the heart of the legal district) ‚Äì and then a move to the Leicester Square Theatre in London's West End. This show received acclaim from several critics including The Stage and What's On Stage. In 2007 Hurly Burly won Best Troupe at the Ministry Of Burlesque awards. They have appeared on the Alan Titchmarsh Show. February 2010 brought the launch of Miss Polly Rae: The All New Hurly Burly Show, with special guest act Elouise, directed by William Baker. Musical direction was by Steve Anderson. The show received high acclaim from critics such as Michael Billington (The Guardian) and Charles Spencer (The Daily Telegraph), amongst others, and it returned to the Garrick Theatre in the West End, newly named The Hurly Burly Show, until May 2011. Miss Polly Rae and her Hurly Burly Girlys have collectively worked alongside Dusty Limits, Frisky and Mannish, Ivy Paige, Lady Carol, Stewart Pemberton, Frank Sanazi and James Devine. Miss Polly Rae is also a singer, and sings songs by the likes of Peggy Lee, Shirley Bassey, Mae West and Doris Day. She has had solo success. In 2007 she was recruited as part of a touring performance team for Agent Provocateur and appeared on The Paul O'Grady Show. In 2008 she became the face of the No 1 Eidos computer game Battlestations Pacific as a wartime sweetheart. In 2015, she won the Best Burlesque award at the London Cabaret Awards.

Sources IPA originates from many sorts of trees, especially conifers. Chemistry IPA is one of the members of the resin acid group and it is a tricyclic diterpene. Target IPA acts on the large-conductance calcium activated K+ channels (BK channels). Mode of action BK channels are formed by Œ± subunits and accessory Œ≤ subunits arranged in tetramers. The Œ± subunit forms the ion conduction pore and the Œ≤ subunit contributes to channel gating. IPA interaction with the BK channel enhances Ca2+ and / or voltage sensitivity of the Œ± subunit of BK channels without affecting the channel conductance. In this state BK channels can still be inhibited by one of their inhibitors, like charybdotoxin (CTX). Opening of the BK channel leads to an increased K+-efflux which hyperpolarizes the resting membrane potential, reducing the excitability of the cell in which the BK-channel is expressed. Toxicity Studies on rainbow trout hepatocytes have shown that IPA increases intracellular calcium release, leading to a disturbance in the calcium homeostasis. This could be important in the possible toxicity of the toxin.

The burglars that absconded with his hands in 1987 reportedly entered though the transom window above the entrance. The cutting of the Hands of Per√≥n refers to a 1987 incident where the tomb of Juan Per√≥n, former President of Argentina, was broken into and his hands dismembered and removed by persons unknown. The incident Per√≥n died in July 1974. His casket remained in the Quinta de Olivos presidential residence until the March 1976 coup. The coffin was then placed in the Per√≥n family tomb in Chacarita Cemetery, located in the Chacarita ward of the city of Buenos Aires. In June 1987, 13 years after his death, the Peronist Justicialist Party received an anonymous letter claiming Per√≥n's hands had been removed from his tomb along with his army cap and sword; the letter demanded the party pay an US$8 million ransom for their return.\\"Peron Hands: Police Find Trail Elusive.\\" The New York Times, September 6, 1987. Accessed October 16, 2009.\\"Grave robbers cut off hands of Juan Peron\\". The Chicago Sun-Times, July 3, 1987. When authorities checked Per√≥n's tomb, they discovered that it had indeed been broken into and the hands and other items removed. Forensic experts who examined the body said the mutilation had occurred only a short time before the discovery. One sourceJohnson, Lyman L. Death, Dismemberment and Memory: Body Politics in Latin America. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2004. . Pp. 251-253. states that the tomb was broken into on June 23, 1987, and that a poem written to him by his last wife, Isabel, had also been removed from the tomb. At the time, some news reports stated that the hands had been removed with \\"a surgical instrument\\", but later reports state that the dismemberment had been done with an electric saw. The head of the Justicialist Party, Vicente Saadi, refused to allow the ransom to be paid. A criminal investigation was begun under the leadership of judge Jaime Far Suau: although six men were arrested and five arraigned,\\"5 Arraigned in Theft of Juan Peron's Hands\\". The Los Angeles Times, September 1, 1987. none were charged in relation to the incident. No suspect has ever been charged, and the hands have never been recovered. Many of those involved in the investigation of the disappearance of Per√≥n's hands (including Judge Far Suau) have since died, some under circumstances considered questionable. There is evidence that the theft had some sort of official support, as the robbers used a key to enter the tomb. Argentinian anthropologistVerdery, Katherine. The Political Lives of Dead Bodies: Reburial and Post-Socialist Change. New York, Columbia University Press, 1999. . Rosana Guber has written that Per√≥n's hands were seen by Argentinians as a symbol of his power, and that their theft was not just a simple criminal matter but also had deep cultural meaning; she viewed the debate about the hands as symbolic of the attempt to promote democracy in the country. Lyman Johnson viewed the dismemberment as \\"a catalyst to destroy the symbolic cult of Per√≥n\\". With Per√≥n's hands gone, Lyman wrote, his importance as a figure also decreased in comparison to that of his second wife, Eva Per√≥n. In their book Second Death: Licio Gelli, The P2 Masonic Lodge and The Plot to Destroy Juan Peron, writers Damian Nabot and David Cox write that the Masonic lodge P2, also known as the Propaganda Due, were involved in the theft, and that there was a ritual involved in the cutting of Peron's hands.Nabot, Damian, and Cox, David.

Introduced around 1970, dunnage bags provide convenient and cost-effective cargo stabilization in ISO sea containers, closed railcars, trucks, and oceangoing vessels. As improperly secured cargo is a safety hazard, dunnage bags improve road safety. According to the European Commission's Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport, \\"up to 25% of accidents involving trucks can be attributable to inadequate cargo securing\\". Usage Dunnage airbags consist of closed chambers made from an elastic film filled with air. When at rest, only the static load generated by the weight of the package contents bears upon the cushioning. When dynamic loads occur, these are absorbed by compression of the cushion. The quantity of inflation air may be varied in accordance with the particular properties and requirements of the package contents. Dunnage bags are commercially available in various sizes and designs, ranging from spheres, standard cushions to corner and edge cushioning and tubular cushioning. Dunnage bags can be used to stabilize, secure, and protect cargo during all sorts of transportation. Dunnage bags are placed in the void between the cargo. Dunnage bags can be used in all modes of transportation. Besides being usable in all modes of transportation, almost every type of cargo can be secured with the use of dunnage bags, including break bulk and palletized cargo, coils, barrels, cases, and crates. Dunnage bags are very safe to use for both the shipping and receiving end of transportation, and are waterproof. They inflate rapidly with compressed air, and are easy to install; compressed air is often available through an outlet in the truck's compressed air system. Important in the use of dunnage bags is that the size of the bag is determined by the void. If this does not match, the bags will not do their work properly with potential large damage to cargo and people. For air cushions it is important to avoid damage as a result of wear and tear. Air cushions should never be used as fillers against doors or any non-rigid surfaces or partitions. Environmental impact Some bags can be reused, and are ultimately recyclable. To reuse the dunnage bag it needs to be undamaged and equipped with a screw-on quick fill valve. For single use, the bag is equipped with a quick-fill one-way safety valve. Inflatable air cushions are available both as disposable items and as recyclable products. Types Paper dunnage bags (kraft) Paper dunnage bags are made out of two components, an inner component that consists of a polyethylene inner bag, the outer component is a paper bag. The outer bag is made of the highest quality, light weight kraft paper of high tensile strength. Paper dunnage bags come in different strengths and varieties and can be made in any special size. The inner component provides optimum pressure and the outer component provides optimum strength. For use in the chemical industry paper dunnage bags can be polycoated. A polycoat will make the dunnage bag resistant to specific chemicals. Woven polypropylene bags Woven Polypropylene bags are extremely durable and can be used in dry and wet conditions. These bags are best for extreme heavy loads. Poly woven airbags have greater elasticity than Kraft paper dunnage airbags for more surface contact with the pallets. Poly woven airbags woven material provides greater tear strength, and superior moisture resistance than most other dunnage bag materials. Poly woven airbags typically have greater reuse opportunities, due to the durability of the woven material, and are recyclable. Polypropylene paper laminated bags The paper used on the outside of the bag is laminated on the inside with a woven polypropylene layer, which allows higher resistance to punctures and moisture. Disadvantages Dunnage bags are susceptible to pointed and sharp articles such as nails.

Amulet) is a Serbian and former Yugoslav rock band. History The band was formed in 1979 by Bogoljub \\"ƒåombe\\" Banjac (vocals), Bo≈°ko \\"ƒåvaja\\" Plaƒákov (bass guitar) and Predrag \\"ƒåole\\" ƒåoka (drums), all three being 'Oƒáe≈°-Neƒáe≈° members, with Slobodan \\"Veƒáa\\" Veƒáalkov (solo guitar) and Tomislav \\"ƒåvaja\\" Milei (rhythm guitar). At first the band performed cover versions by acts such as The Rolling Stones, Riblja ƒåorba and Azra, and slowly prepared their own material. The band had rehearsals at the Zlatibor construction firm, where, in late 1979, they had their debut live appearance, and earned the first payment performing at a party organized by the union of the deaf people. During 1980 the band rehearsed intensely, and occasionally performed at elementary schools. During the same year, the band was joined by Petar \\"Pera Gumeni\\" Krsiƒá, who had the reputation of a showman, and the new lineup, on the invitation by Radio Novi Sad producer Jovan Adamov, recorded four demo songs. The following year, the band performed at the Festival Omladina. Before the band went on hiatus, as the members went to serve the Yugoslav People's Army, the band had another lineup change as the new members became Zoran Bojƒçevski (bass guitar) and Vojislav \\"Voja U≈°ar\\" Viliƒá (solo guitar). The band reunited in 1985, this time featuring Banjac on vocals and rhythm guitar and Veƒáalkov switched to bass guitar. At a studio in Bukovac the band recorded material consisting of ten songs, intending to release them, which did not happen due to the low quality of the recordings. During the same year, the band performed as an opening act on the Bajaga i Instruktori Yugoslav tour. Due to the positive reaction by the audience and Bajaga i Instruktori themselves, the band also performed on the Jahaƒçi magle tour, during which, due to a quarrel, the band disbanded. On June 1987, Banjac, as guitarist and vocalist, reformed Amajlija with bassist Zoran \\"Gera\\" Geriƒá and drummer Zoran \\"Petrija\\" Petriƒá. Owing to the band manager Dragan Veljkovski, the band performed as an opening act on the Vojvodina tours of the bands Film, Kerber and Griva. At the time, the band wrote their first hit songs, \\"Po≈æuri dru≈æe\\" and \\"Dobar drug\\", recorded at the Bukovac Barbaro studio by Banjac, who previously dissolved the current Amajlija lineup, with guitarist Zoran \\"Anka\\" Anƒçiƒá and sound engineer Milan ƒÜiriƒá, a former ƒåista Proza member. The band released their debut album Samo ti (Only You) in 1989 through Diskoton. The album was produced by Aniƒçiƒá. The band, now consisting of Petar Krstiƒá (vocals), Bogoljub Banjac (guitar), Zoran Aniƒçiƒá (guitar), Slobodan Veƒákalov (bass guitar), Dejan Starƒçeviƒá (keyboard) and Julije Dondo (drums), promoted the album, mainly on television and radio appearances. Aniƒçiƒá also produced the band's following album Za≈°to si tako blesava i luda (Why Are You so Weird and Crazy) which was released in 1990 through PGP-RTB. Since Aniƒçiƒá decided to devote himself completely to a career as a producer, Veƒákalov switched to playing guitar, and the new bassist became the former Arena member Zoran \\"Zobma\\" Marjanoviƒá. While previous Amajlija album was mostly hard rock-oriented, Za≈°to si tako blesava i luda presented the band in a melodic pop rock sound, with the songs \\"To je bio dan\\", \\"ƒåeznem da te zeznem\\", and \\"Veruj u ljubav\\" being the album's main hits. Like on the previous album, Za≈°to si tako blesava i luda music was composed by Banjac who, with Predrag \\"Srba\\" Srbljanin, wrote all the lyrics. After the album release, the new band members became Miroslav \\"Kiƒáa\\" Maletiƒç (solo guitar), and former Love Hunters member Milan \\"Miƒáko\\" Ljubenkoviƒá (drums) Amajlija's third album, Vruƒáe + hladno (Hot + Cold), was recorded in London in 1991 by Banjac and Aniƒçiƒá only. On the album, Aniƒçiƒá played all the instruments. Andy Kershaw appeared on the album as special guest, playing acoustic guitar. The album brought more guitar-oriented sound than on the previous release, and the only hit from the album was the acoustic ballad \\"Ume biti gadno\\", which the band had considered not to release at all. Due to the intense live performances after the album release, including the 1992 and 1993 Gitarijada festival in Zajeƒçar, Vruƒáe + hladno became the band's greatest commercial success. The band's fourth studio album, ƒåista zabava (Pure Fun) was released through PGP- RTB successor PGP-RTS. The album, recorded with Bajaga i Instruktori member Sa≈°a Lokner on keyboards, featured an electronic music-oriented sound, resulting negative album critics. The tracks \\"Dala si mi\\" and the cover of the ƒêorƒëe Bala≈°eviƒá song \\"Prva ljubav\\" were distinguished as hits on the album, and, due to their frequent radio broadcasts, the band got the opportunity to perform at the Music Festival Budva. After the album release, on May 13, 1994, the band performed at the Novi Sad Danube park handball playground, which was one of the most successful concerts the band had throughout their career. In 1995, with the help of Nenad \\"Japanac\\" Stefanoviƒá, the band recorded the album Nikad vi≈°e kao pre (Never Again Like Before), released in 1996 and recorded at the Novi Sad Dum Dum studio, where, for the first time, all the album tracks were recorded by the band themselves. In 1996, after the album release, the band had more than seventy live appearances, mainly at the Zeppelin Club, and the Ujvideki Sinhaz theatre. The band also performed at the 1995 and 1996 Novi Sad Koncert Godine. In 1998, Veƒáalkov left the band, being replaced by Miroslav Maletiƒá, but, soon after, the band went on hiatus and performed occasionally only. In 1999, the band performed at the ≈†trand festival with Banjac's son Petar on drums for the first time. The band continued their activity in the mid-2000s. On July 5, 2008, the band performed as an opening act for Status Quo at the Rock Bastion Festival in Novi Sad.Rock Bastion - Status Quo, plakatt.com They released their fifth studio album Prosula si sake na kimono (You Spilled Sake on Your Kimono) in 2009 through Komuna Belgrade. The album featured nine songs, including the rerecorded version of the song \\"Dobar drug\\", and the bonus track \\"Ki≈°ne kapljice\\", recorded with the tamburitza orchestra Zorule. On May 26, 2009 Amajlija performed, alongside The Answer, as the opening act for AC/DC on the concert held at Partizan Stadium in Belgrade.Izmeƒëu dva albuma Amajlija svirala sa AC/DC i Status kvo, 24sata.rs Discography Studio albums *Samo ti (1989) *Za≈°to si tako blesava i luda (1990) *Vruƒáe + hladno (1992) *ƒåista zabava (1993) *Nikad vi≈°e kao pre (1996) *Prosula si sake na kimono (2009) References * EX YU ROCK enciklopedija 1960-2006, Janjatoviƒá Petar; * NS rockopedija, novosadska rock scena 1963-2003, Mijatoviƒá Bogomir, SWITCH, 2005 External links *Official website *Amajlija official Facebook page *Amajlija at Discogs Category:Serbian rock music groups Category:Serbian hard rock musical groups Category:Serbian pop rock music groups Category:Yugoslav rock music groups Category:Yugoslav hard rock musical groups Category:Musical groups from Novi Sad Category:Musical groups established in 1979 Category:1979 establishments in Yugoslavia ","title":"Amajlija"},{"id":"24675955","text":"Greenpeace or Greenpeace International is a non-governmental environmental organization founded in Vancouver in 1971.

It originally aired on October 12, 2009.  Plot  Lily and Marshall are excited to have another couple to hang out with. Future Ted explains that they had fared poorly with previous couples, coming across as clingy and desperate. With Barney and Robin now a couple, they hope to turn their luck around. After an evening together, Lily and Marshall believe that it was \\"the best night ever\\", despite Robin and Barney being obviously bored and uncomfortable, with them complaining about how weird Marshall got about the cheese and how they would overreact when one little thing went wrong. Robin and Barney ignore their messages and avoid Lily and Marshall, but they eventually admit that they do not want to be \\"couple friends\\". Devastated, Lily and Marshall blame each other for the failure, citing Marshall's bizarre photo montages of trivial events and Lily's tendency to plan big outings too quickly. After a week apart from Lily and Marshall, Robin and Barney realize they miss their friends, and head over to their condo, only to find them enjoying the company of another couple. Barney and Robin are crushed by the rejection. They interrupt another couples' night at Lily and Marshall's apartment, leading them outside with a trail of egg timers for Charades, which is a reference to what happened earlier in the episode when the timer had broke in their double date. In the rain, Barney and Robin ask for one more chance, which Marshall and Lily grant them, attracted by their \\"bad boy... and girl\\" mystique. They promise to never fight again, and share a hug. Ted has settled into the persona of a professor, often wearing a tweed jacket. He claims it attracts the ladies, but after a woman leaves his apartment in the morning without having sex, Barney and Robin accuse him of being the \\"Sexless Innkeeper\\". Barney elaborates with a poem set in a Dickensian version of Queens, where he was caught in a blizzard, walked a few blocks to an ugly woman's apartment, and feigned sleep to avoid sex. Ted is annoyed at the new nickname and constantly tries to prove them wrong. As Barney and Robin leave for brunch with Lily and Marshall, Ted recites a poem of his own for Barney, telling the tale of a busty young blonde woman who was turned on by his professor persona. Barney is skeptical, but is left speechless when the young woman appears at Ted's bedroom door, inviting Ted back to bed, thus ending the reign of the Sexless Innkeeper.  Critical response  Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club rated the episode with a grade B. Brian Zoromski of IGN gave the episode 6.8 out of 10. The review described the episode as \\"mostly unfunny\\"; he went on to say that he liked the premise of Marshall writing sentimental songs for mundane occasions, but that it was not part of a believable story.

Recorded throughout 2008 and 2009, the album is the band's first since the departure of keyboard player Spencer Albee, and their first full-length release of all-new material since ¬°Viva Nueva!. With just over an hour of music, the album is the band's second longest after Long Division and features the most experimental work of their career.  Background and recording  In 2008, the band set out to start recording their first full-length album of new material since 2001's ¬°Viva Nueva!. (Some of Light At The End's music was previously recorded before the band broke up in 2002, and all but four songs had been previously played live before the break-up.) On September 17, 2008, the band announced on their Myspace that Albee, their keyboard player since 1995's Long Division had left the band. Drummer Tony McNaboe explained that Albee was leaving on good terms, and that the album would continue as planned with multi-instrumentalist Nigel Hall from Lettuce filling in on keyboards. On October 17, 2008, the band premiered the song \\"The Smallest Spark\\" at The Asylum in Portland, the first new song of the album to be played live. Word on the new album was scarce until February 4, 2009, when Dave Gutter announced the names of a few new songs that would eventually appear on the album (such as \\"The Downside Of Looking Up\\", \\"Arizona\\", \\"The Same Does Not Apply\\" and \\"Nuts And Bolts\\") along with a tentative track listing. Gutter also explained that the band was experimenting with many different instruments not typical of normal Rustics Overtones albums, which would become apparent in the final album's overall sound. Little was heard from the band about the new album until August 2009 when the song \\"The Same Does Not Apply\\" was premiered on local alternative rock station WCYY. In mid-August, the band held a cowbell-playing competition in which the winner would play onstage with the band to the song at its debut at the Machigonne Music Festival on August 29, 2009. At the festival, the band premiered the songs \\"Arizona\\", \\"Like The Blues\\", \\"Kathleen Caffeiene\\", \\"The Downside Of Looking Up\\" and \\"The Same Does Not Apply\\", closing with a full- band version of \\"The Smallest Spark\\". On October 16, 2009, Gutter announced that the album would be named The New Way Out, and would be released on November 11. He went on to explain that over the past two years, the band had been constructing its own brand-new recording studio in which to record the album, and that the album was self-produced by the band members. Referring to the recording process, he explained that \\"We spent the last two years writing and recording The New Way Out and at times it seemed longer. We have always celebrated our democratic approach to writing and recording. Siting the \\"compromise\\" of our creative process as our strength. While making this record that \\"compromise\\" was really put to the test.\\" The album was released on Digipak CD to all Bull Moose Music stores four days early on November 7, 2009, to coincide with their show at the Paradise Rock Club in Boston, Massachusetts.  Artwork  The artwork for the album is once again done by long-time collaborator Patrick Corrigan, a popular Portland artist and member of Seekonk. The overall style is very similar to the original independent release of Light At The End, with an aesthetic similar to that of pencil drawing in a sketchbook. The inner artwork features a few references to the art from Light At the End, including a man dressed in a rabbit suit and two canoers in a psychedelic landscape. The drawing also features a metal boot with wings, a reference to the artwork for the Rooms by the Hour song \\"Iron Boots\\".  Reception  Initial reception to the album was positive. The Boston Herald praised the album's mix of \\"Beatles-reminiscent psychedelia, multi-layered orchestral pop and huge-eared references to everything from Pink Floyd to Coldplay and Radiohead - all of it wrapped around one warm, captivating melody after another\\", giving the album an \\"A\\" and calling it their \\"magnum opus - a great piece of work in every way.\\"Convey, Kevin R, \\"New Way Out Review\\", Boston Herald, 6 November 2009. Accessed on 13 October 2009. The Portland Phoenix also praised the album's \\"textured and dense amalgam of the collected band‚Äôs many tastes and endeavors\\", although it noted that the sound \\"is far from that core of primal energy that launched the band and drove it to its many heights\\" and the reviewer remarked that, \\"I just have to admit I wish this new album had elements of both.

Old Book of Tang, vol. 17, part 2.), courtesy name Zongxuan (), formally Duke Gonghui of Jinyang (), was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, serving as a chancellor during the reigns of Emperor Jingzong and Emperor Wenzong.  Background  It is not known when Dou Yizhi was born, but it is known that his family was from the Tang capital municipality Jingzhao (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi).Old Book of Tang, vol. 167. His family claimed ancestry from the Han Dynasty official Dou Wu (father to Empress Dou Miao). His grandfather Dou Yuanchang () served as a county magistrate, while his father Dou Yu () served as a prefectural prefect.New Book of Tang, vol. 71. Dou Yizhi passed the imperial examination in the Mingjing () class, and was made a copywriter (Ê†°Êõ∏ÈÉé, Xiaoshu Lang) at the Palace Library. He later passed a special imperial examination in judging cases, and was made the sheriff of Lantian County (ËóçÁî∞, in modern Xi'an). He later successively served as Yousi Langzhong (), a supervisorial official in the administration of the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng); Bingbu Langzhong (), a supervisorial official at the ministry of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®, Bingbu); and Libu Langzhong (), a supervisorial official at the ministry of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, Libu).  During Emperor Xianzong's reign  In 811, Dou Yizhi was made the deputy chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤‰∏≠‰∏û, Yushi Zhongcheng). In 813, he was made an imperial attendant (Áµ¶‰∫ã‰∏≠, Jishizhong), and then made the governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Shanguo Circuit (ÈôùËô¢, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan). At a later point, he was made the mayor of Jingzhao. While he was serving at Jingzhao, there was an incident where Han Wu (), the sheriff of Wannian County (), one of the two counties making up the capital proper Chang'an, was found to have engaged in corruption. Dou ordered his subordinate Wei Zhengwu () to investigate, and Wei found that Han had embezzled 300,000 coins-worth of money. Then-reigning Emperor Xianzong, however, did not believe that investigations were sufficiently thorough and ordered a reinvestigation; the reinvestigation concluded that Han actually embezzled 10 times the amount Wei reported. As a result, in 817,Old Book of Tang, vol. 15. Dou was demoted to be the prefect of Jin Prefecture (ÈáëÂ∑û, in modern Ankang, Shaanxi), while Wei was exiled. In 818, Dou was made the governor of Xuanshe Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠ô, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui), as well as the prefect of its capital Xuan Prefecture ().  During Emperor Muzong's reign  In 822, by which time Emperor Xianzong's son Emperor Muzong was emperor, there was a mutiny at Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) in which the soldiers expelled their military governor (Jiedushi) Li Yuan (). Dou Yizhi heard about the mutiny and was concerned that his soldiers may be tempted to do the same. He considered passing out money and silk as rewards to them to endear them to him, but there was advice that doing so, without any reason, may in fact cause soldiers to fear that they were being suspected. He therefore did not do so, but rumors that he was passing out rewards already spread among the soldiers. One of the officers, Wang Guoqing () thus plotted a mutiny. Wang's plot was discovered, and Dou executed Wang and over 200 of his coconspirators.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 242.

During Emperor Wenzong's reign  In 828, by which time Wenzong was emperor (after Emperor Jingzong was assassinated around the new year 827), Dou Yizhi was relieved of his chancellor post and made the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei) as well as the prefect of its capital Xiang Prefecture (), although he retained the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi title as an honorary title.

It has room for 1000 people.Churches in Finland History The people of Savonlinna had no church of their own and were obliged to go to the church in S√§√§minki. In 1850 governor Aleksander Thesleff gave orders to build a church in Savonniemi. The actual construction began in 1874. In 1896 the new Diocese of Savonlinna was founded and the Savonlinna church became a cathedral. The first bishop was Gustaf Johansson. In 1925 the bishop's seat was moved to Vyborg, but the church still retained \\"cathedral\\" as its name. During the Winter War on 1 May 1940, Savonlinna was bombed and the church was damaged. It was restored in 1947‚Äì1948 by architect Bertel Liljeqvist. In 1990‚Äì1991, it was renovated by Ansu √Önstr√∂m.

Ladenberg was the son of the Prussian Minister of State Philipp von Ladenberg. After initially receiving his education from tutors, he attended the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Gymnasium in Berlin and at age 17 joined the Dragoon Guards Regiment for a year. In 1816 he left the military as a Lieutenant and studied Law and cameralism in Berlin, Heidelberg und G√∂ttingen. After successfully completing his studies he received a place as a law clerk in 1818 in the Prussian civil service. From 1824, his career led him from the post of Regierungsrat and legal advisor in Cologne to that of Oberregierungsrat 1829 in K√∂nigsberg und Merseburg. He was then made \\"regional president\\" (Regierungspr√§sident) in Trier in 1834, and six years later Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein appointed him to the ministry for education and cultural affairs and as member of the Prussian Council of State in Berlin. When Altenstein died on 14 May 1840, Ladenberg was entrusted with the latter's political responsibilities in a provisional capacity until 8 October. From the 22 October he took up this position permanently and from that day onwards led the department for religious Protestant, education and health affairs in the ministry of Johann Albrecht Friedrich von Eichhorn. In 1841 he also received the role of extraordinary government commissioner at the Humboldt University of Berlin. When Eichhorn resigned all his posts due to the political consequences of the Revolutions of 1848, Ladenberg led the ministry, also under the ministers Maximilian von Schwerin-Putzar and Johann Karl Rodbertus, who held office very briefly. From July to November 1848 this was an interim appointment, which was then made permanent. Amongst other things, Ladenberg was significantly involved with various reforms: establishment of the Protestant Oberkirchenrat (a senior administrative body of the church), preparation of an education law and a health law as well as managing a reorganisation of the art establishment. Through the Punctation of Olm√ºtz of 29 November 1850, Ladenberg felt compelled to resign, but neglected to do so in order to see through certain legislation. From 9 November to 12 December 1850, Ladenberg was made interim Prime Minister. He was later made a Wirklicher Geheimer Rat and as such took over the management of the financial authority.

In 1968 the Haliburton School of The Arts was founded by a local group (the Haliburton Highlands Guild of Fine Arts) in collaboration with the new Sir Sandford Fleming College started in the same year in Peterborough. The school began to attract artists to the community to teach the courses and helped to develop a growing community of artists who made their living in the County. The guild supported the development of small groups that began developing arts activity. This led to the creation of the Rails End Gallery in 1979, the Haliburton Concert Series (offering three (mostly classical) concerts each year) and the Haliburton County Studio Tour in 1987. The guild now operates as Rails End Gallery and Arts Centre. The Haliburton School of The Arts grew to be one of Canada's largest art schools. In 1997, an Arts Committee was formed as an ad hoc committee of the Community Economic Development Committee of the Haliburton County Development Corporation to support local economic development through the promotion and advancement of the visual arts in Haliburton County. This committee undertook initiatives including the installation of public sculptures, creation of the Haliburton Sculpture Forest, development of marketing materials related to the visual arts and professional development workshops for visual artists. In parallel with these initiatives to promote the visual arts in Haliburton County, the community realized the dream of building a 230-seat theatre in conjunction with the expansion of the Haliburton Highlands Secondary school and the creation of the Highlands Summer Festival. The theatre festival attracts an annual audience of over 5,000 people. The municipalities of Minden Hills and Dysart et al. began investing in the enhancement of the public galleries in Minden and Haliburton to allow for year-round operations. The Haliburton School of The Arts built a year-round campus in a park setting in 2003 and offers programs attracting 3500 part-time students and 120 students in ten 15-week programs. The Haliburton County Folk Society was created in 1999 and runs an open stage once a month, a series of performances by singer-songwriters and a small folk festival. Highlands Media Arts, committed to video arts, was formed in 2003, and the Haliburton Highlands Writers and Editors Network was created in 2004. Creation of the Arts Council~Haliburton Highlands In 2002, the Arts Committee, in collaboration with other arts organizations in the County, formed a committee to create a plan for the development and promotion of the arts (not just the visual arts) in Haliburton County, and to create a body to coordinate the implementation of the plan. The Arts Council~Haliburton Highlands was formed under the umbrella of the Haliburton County Development Corporation in the fall of 2003. Fifteen individuals involved in a range of artistic disciplines and arts organizations formed the first Steering Committee. The need in Haliburton County was not another organization that produced artistic events but one that supported the existing artists, organizations and businesses involved in production and programming with marketing, organizational development, a unified voice for the arts, opportunities for collaboration, opportunities for networking, training and professional expertise. The Arts Council provides assistance for the organization of sectors that are not already established and supports artists, arts businesses and organizations with the marketing of their activities and events. In its first year of operation the Arts Council co-founded the Haliburton Tourism Coalition which represents all of the providers of tourism products in the county, was invited to sit on the Economic Diversification Committee of the County of Haliburton (which was the committee of the County Council responsible for the implementation of the county strategic plan) and was chosen to participate in Artscape's first Creative Cluster program. The county adopted the slogan \\"A Natural Work of Art\\" as part of its brand image. In the fall of 2005 the membership of the Arts Council elected a board of directors (to replace the steering committee) and adopted a set of by-laws and filed for incorporation. The Arts Council has a membership of 320 including artists, arts businesses, arts organizations, supporting businesses and organizations and individuals. The Arts Council~Haliburton Highlands focuses on: * Organizing efforts to market and bring attention to the artists, artistic endeavours and arts events in Haliburton County through initiatives such as the annual Arts Directory and Map, the Events Calendar, the monthly listings of events, workshops and opportunities, running \\"Art-in-the-Streets - artists demonstrations on the main street and at events throughout the county * Providing professional development for artists and individuals involved in arts businesses and organizations such as workshops on grant writing, artists working in the schools, income tax for self-employed artists, PIPEDA, creative clusters, copyright, and visual marketing. * Providing services for arts business and organizations on development and planning. * Providing networking opportunities for artists, art organizations and businesses and other individuals, business and organization supportive of the arts through activities such as the semi-annual Arty Party and semi-annual forums. * Ensuring that the arts have a voice at the decision-making tables in the county through having representation on county committees. * Through running an artists-in-the-schools program in rural schools, collaborating with organizations to encourage arts education for all ages, collaborating with the Haliburton School of The Arts. * Undertaking research with provincial and national organizations to be able to keep the community informed about information related to their arts practices. * Celebrating the contribution of artists and the arts to the community through activities such as the Arts Honours Gala.

All but Barney retired from the business in 1996 after Mick Nash took over as managing director. The company operated an office in Berlin from 1987 to 2004. Gerald Barney started his career at the Design Research Unit designing logos like the iconic British Rail logo The agency originally started as a graphic design agency yet evolved and increased its disciplines as client demands grew. This has been central to the agency's growth and it now covers typography, architecture, interior design, corporate branding, packaging, 3D Graphics and online design. The agency took its name from the address of its original offices situated on Sedley Place adjacent to Oxford Street and Woodstock Street in London. This street was named after Orlando Sedley, an 18th-century furniture maker who had his workshops located there. The agency relocated to its current offices in 1985 on Venn St, Clapham.

The primary developers are named as Rami Lehti and Pablo Virolainen, who are both associated with the Tampere University of Technology, along with Richard van den Berg, an independent Dutch security consultant. The project is used on many Unix-like systems as an inexpensive baseline control and rootkit detection system. Functionality AIDE takes a \\"snapshot\\" of the state of the system, register hashes, modification times, and other data regarding the files defined by the administrator. This \\"snapshot\\" is used to build a database that is saved and may be stored on an external device for safekeeping. When the administrator wants to run an integrity test, the administrator places the previously built database in an accessible place and commands AIDE to compare the database against the real status of the system. Should a change have happened to the computer between the snapshot creation and the test, AIDE will detect it and report it to the administrator. Alternatively, AIDE can be configured to run on a schedule and report changes daily using scheduling technologies such as cron, which is the default behavior of the Debian AIDE package. This is mainly useful for security purposes, given that any malicious change which could have happened inside of the system would be reported by AIDE.

He has often been credited as Larry Mullins, his adopted name.\\"Eye on the Scene,\\" Metro Pulse, June 28, 2007. Accessed at the Internet Archive, October 2, 2015. He is mostly known for his work with Iggy Pop, Swans, The Residents, Iggy and The Stooges and Silver Apples. In 2015 he began performing live as multi- keyboardist with Nick Cave and continued performing with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds during their world tour for the album Skeleton Tree. He stars as the big band drummer Willy Schuricke in the German cable series Babylon Berlin . Career In 1990 he appeared as Larry Mullins on his first professionally released album with the band The Ringling Sisters, produced by Lou Adler (Rocky Horror Picture Show, Cheech & Chong, The Mamas & the Papas). Dammit is best known as Larry Mullins for his 1990‚Äì1999 collaboration with Iggy Pop as his drummer. During this time, he recorded three albums with Iggy Pop: (American Caesar, Naughty Little Doggie and Avenue B) and made several soundtrack appearances: (Freddy's Dead - The Final Nightmare, Fast Track to Nowhere, The Crow: City of Angels, Coffee and Cigarettes, Monster Men - Space Goofs). His percussion work appeared throughout the entire score for Johnny Depp's film The Brave starring Marlon Brando. During this period, Dammit also toured extensively with Iggy Pop and performed at more than 700 concerts worldwide together. Their legendary live concert at the original Paris Olympia in 1991 was released as the DVD Kiss My Blood and serves as a genuine document of their energetic work together. He joined Swans in 1995, working closely with Michael Gira even after he disbanded Swans and formed The Angels of Light. Together they collaborated on ten releases and approximately 85 concerts worldwide which reached into 2001. Rumors have circulated for years regarding his musical collaborations with The Residents, although he has denied details of his involvement, often referring interviewers to The Cryptic Corporation, the management of The Residents. Toby Dammit is credited on numerous releases by The Residents as a \\"sound contributor\\" but his actual contributions to these releases remain unclear. In 2000, Toby Dammit started a Hamburg-based record company with The Residents European label impresario Guido Randzio called Hit Thing Records specializing in rare re-issues by Yello, Die Haut & Nick Cave, Liaisons Dangereuses and Georges Montalba as well as his own collaborations with Thomas Wydler of Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds and Luther Hawkins. The label shared offices with Euro Ralph, The Residents European label, which furthered the lore of his possible involvement with the world's most mysteriously unidentified band. In 2001 he began a decade of work together with Swiss artist Stephan Eicher, which produced 5 albums, 2 live DVD's, numerous singles and 186 concerts worldwide IN Switzerland, France, Belgium and Germany. In 2006 he met fellow American saxophonist Jessie Evans in Berlin and they produced a duo act that recorded and toured worldwide for seven years resulting in 2 studio albums and 225 concerts together, climaxing at Olympia (Paris) opening for Iggy and The Stooges. In 2011, he was invited to join Iggy and The Stooges onstage in England and remained their live drummer for 60 concerts worldwide. In 2015, he was invited to join Silver Apples as a guest onstage in Knoxville, Tennessee, which resulted in a homecoming concert for both he and the electronic music pioneer Simeon Oliver Coxe III. Their entire time together was filmed and recorded for a documentary film by director Trey Counce. He has worked on many significant feature films as both a composer or musician, including: School of Rock, Premium Rush, End of Watch, Capitalism: A Love Story, Apple Jack, Monsieur N., Scott Walker: 30 Century Man, Eierdiebe, Dead Dogs Lie, Dead Man Down, Connasse, Princesse des c≈ìurs and most recently Babylon Berlin. Throughout his career, he has worked with a myriad of international artists, notably in France, including: Zaz, Rapha√´l Haroche, Keren Ann, Bertrand Burgalat, Paul Personne, Fred Avril, A.S Dragon, MeLL, Marie Modiano, Chlo√© Mons, Ndidi Onukwulu, Brisa Roch√©, Rosemary Standley and James Eleganz.

The film centers on Zaza (Lior Ashkenazi, in his breakthrough role), the 31-year-old child of tradition-minded Georgian Jewish immigrants who are anxiously trying to arrange a marriage for him. Unbeknownst to them, he is secretly dating a 34-year-old divorc√©e, Judith (Ronit Elkabetz). When his parents discover the relationship and violently intervene, Zaza must choose between his family traditions and his love. Most of the main characters are Georgian-Israeli and the dialogue is partly in the Judaeo-Georgian language and partly in Hebrew. The film was positively reviewed and was Israel's submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the 74th Academy Awards.  Synopsis  Zaza (Lior Ashkenazi) is a 31-year-old Georgian-Israeli PhD student at Tel Aviv University whose family is trying to arrange a marriage for him within the Georgian community. Zaza and his parents, Yasha and Lili, visit the home of a possible match, Ilana, who is 17 and still in high school. No decision is made, and it is mentioned that he has already seen about a hundred prospective brides. After dropping his parents off at their apartment building, Zaza drives to a pay phone and calls his girlfriend Judith (Ronit Elkabetz), a 34-year-old Moroccan-Israeli divorc√©e he is dating without his parents' knowledge. After Judith's daughter Madona has gone to bed (Judith is unsuccessfully attempting to conceal the relationship from her), Zaza goes to her apartment and they have sex, in an explicit, naturalistic sequence. Meanwhile, Zaza's parents find that they have left their house key in Zaza's car and spend the night at the home of their relatives Simon and Margalit. When Zaza doesn't answer repeated phone calls during the night, Yasha concludes that he is sleeping at a lover's house. Judith is unacceptable to Zaza's parents because she is divorced, has a child, and is older than Zaza. A number of Zaza's relatives stake out her apartment building, planning to confront the couple and frighten Judith into leaving Zaza. The next time Zaza visits Judith, his relatives barge into her apartment and attempt to break up the relationship through polite argument, humiliation, and threats of violence, as Madona (whom Judith has finally introduced to Zaza) watches, frightened. Simon takes down a decorative sword from Judith's wall and holds it to her throat. Zaza and Judith say little, and eventually Zaza unconvincingly tells Judith their relationship is over and leaves with his family. He returns shortly and attempts to resume the evening where it left off, but Judith quietly tells him that she doesn't want to see him again. Back at his apartment, Zaza has a further confrontation with his parents. Some time later Zaza's parents return to Judith's apartment building. When Judith comes home, Lili approaches her and gives Madona a teddy bear as a peace offering, while Yasha stays in the car. In the apartment, Lili asks Judith if she has seen Zaza. Judith initially says she hasn't, but soon tearfully admits that Zaza has been calling her and begging her to marry him. Judith has refused because Zaza's reaction when his family invaded her apartment made her realize that \\"he loves you more than me,\\" and she has decided the relationship is bad for all concerned. Back in the car, Yasha asks Lili if she will accept Judith as a wife for Zaza. Lili, now more sympathetic toward Judith, tells him that they should wait and see if Zaza gets over her. The next scene opens with Zaza and Yasha standing next to each other at urinals in a public restroom. It becomes clear that they are at Zaza's wedding reception, and Zaza is drunk. Zaza returns to the reception hall and gives a long, awkward, repetitive speech, while his wife, Lea, stands uncomfortably by his side. Eventually he tells the guests that he \\"has a woman on the side more beautiful than my wife\\" and drags Simon onstage to ask him to confirm this. Simon brings Zaza's mother onstage as Zaza's other woman, relieving the tension, and Zaza and Lili embrace. The film ends with Zaza and his bride dancing with the rest of his family.

Geography Lincoln Village blocks Using current street names, the Lincoln Village neighborhood is bounded by W Becher Street on the north to the Kinnickinnic River on the south, by South 5th Street on the east to South 20th Street on the west. Demographics Lincoln Village is home to over 16,000 residents. This population is approximately 55% Latino, 30% European American, 10% African American, and 5% of other ethnicities. The median household income as of 2007 was $28,145. As of 2007, homeownership was attained by 54% of Lincoln Village households.https://www.census.gov History The neighborhood was founded by Milwaukee's Polish community in the late 19th century. The growing number of Polish immigrants coming to Milwaukee in the late 19th and early 20th centuries created a great demand for new home construction. In 1880, there were approximately 30,000 Polish living in Milwaukee, making it the second largest ethnic population in the city. According to the 2000 US Census, there were 57,485 Polish residents of Milwaukee, making it the third largest Polish population in the United States.http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFIteratedFacts?_event=&geo;_id=16000US5553000&_geoContext=01000US|04000US55|16000US5553000&_street=&_county=milwaukee&_cityTown=milwaukee&_state=04000US55&_zip=&_lang=en&_sse=on&ActiveGeoDiv;=&_useEV=&pctxt;=fph&pgsl;=160&_submenuId=factsheet_2&ds;_name=DEC_2000_SAFF&_ci_nbr=551&qr;_name=DEC_2000_SAFF_A1160¬Æ=DEC_2000_SAFF_A1160%3A551&_keyword=&_industry= Some of the original Polish population of Lincoln Village has remained and mixed with the continuing waves of new immigrant populations to arrive in Milwaukee. Lincoln Village is one of the most culturally, ethnically, and economically diverse communities in Wisconsin. The newest residents of Lincoln Village have immigrated predominately from the Jalisco and Michoac√°n States of Mexico., with other, less predominant groups immigrating from Central and South America. The cultural similarities and also cultural diversity of Lincoln Village have contributed greatly to the stability of the neighborhood. The neighborhood's main commercial street, West Lincoln Avenue, is the home of two historic landmarks - the Basilica of St. Josaphat and Forest Home Cemetery which were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and 1980, respectively. The commercial district is the only designated Wisconsin Main Street in Milwaukee, and is also a member of the local Main Street Milwaukee program. These programs, operated by the Lincoln Village Business Association, serve to fill commercial vacancies in Lincoln Village as well as promote historic preservation and to maintain the aesthetic quality of the neighborhood. Today, the main street in Lincoln Village is full of specialty Mexican and Polish shops, one of the oldest florist businesses in Milwaukee, the largest bicycle shop in Milwaukee and the independent Milwaukee Bicycle Company brand, a recording studio, and dining establishments with cuisine from Serbia, El Salvador, and Mexico. Architecture W. Lincoln Ave at S. 12th St Much of the neighborhood's housing and commercial building stock have been preserved in their original condition. Because of this, Lincoln Village is the densest neighborhood in the State of Wisconsin and the streets have a strong European feel. The predominant residential building type in the neighborhood is the Polish flat, an early 20th-century form of housing that resembled a small cape-style home raised story to incorporate a new living space on the ground floor. The relatively small size of the Polish flat and the small parcel sizes of the time resulted in a high density of building construction within the neighborhoods. Along the neighborhood's main street, West Lincoln Avenue, the predominant building type is mixed-use with a strong emphasis of Polish gables and attention to fine architectural detail. Basilica of St. Josaphat The dome of the Basilica of St. Josaphat. The magnificent dome of St. Josaphat Basilica rises as a crown jewel of Milwaukee's south side. The parish was formed by Father Wilhelm Grutza in 1888 and named after Josaphat Kuntsevych, an Eastern European bishop and martyr. As Polish immigrants continued to arrive on the south side of Milwaukee, the need for a larger church grew. Architect Erhard Brielmaier was consulted and in 1896 plans were completed for the Basilica design that Lincoln Village has today. When Father Grutza traveled to Chicago to buy brick for these plans, he learned that the Chicago Federal Building (Post Office and Customs House) was to be razed. Seizing the opportunity, he purchased the entire building, including stones, hardware, and six granite Corinthian columns for re-use at his church. St. Josaphat's is modeled after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. It is Neo- Renaissance in style, with a cross-shaped floor plan. The Basilica is 212 feet by 128 feet. Two 100 foot towers frame a columned portico on the north. The massive copper-sheathed dome rises 250 feet from the ground level. The interior of the Basilica is extensively decorated with murals, paintings, and gilded plaster work. The stained glass windows, imported from Innsbruck, Austria portray Polish as well as traditional Biblical themes. There are five altars of marble and onyx, an ornate hand-carved marble pulpit, and marble stations of the cross. St. Josaphat's was elevated to the status of Minor Basilica in 1929, an honor awarded only to the grandest, most beautiful, and historically significant structures. St. Josaphat's continues to be a parish church with a largely Polish congregation. Grutza Building The Grutza Block This outstanding commercial building is situated on land once belonging to the Coleman family's Hazelwood Estate at 610 W. Lincoln Ave. Father Wilhelm Grutza, pastor of St. Josaphat's, purchased a parcel from Ellen Coleman in 1899, directly across the street from the Basilica, then in its final stages of construction. Like the Basilica, this building was designed by Erhard Brielmaier and it is said that the commercial building utilized leftover materials from the Basilica's construction. The large pediment and prominent bays were designed in a robust Baroque fashion to complement the Basilica across the street. The earliest known tenants in the commercial building were Jos. Rechlicz, a retail clothier who occupied the east storefront from 1902 to 1903, and Steve Rozga, who operated a furniture store and undertaking establishment in the west storefront between 1901 and 1907. Riviera Theater The former Riviera Theater is now a storage facility for the Milwaukee Bicycle Co.. The permit to build the Riviera Theater (1005 W. Lincoln Ave) was taken out in May 1919. The newspaper announced its construction cost as $125,000. The architect was Lesser and Schutte. The theater had its first showing on January 28, 1920 and showed Polish language kiddie matinees. The Riviera was a good example of a \\"transitional\\" theater as days of the \\"photoplay parlor\\" were ending and the movie palace had yet to fully arrive. Further foreshadowing the movie palace, the Riviera featured the organist Casimir Uszler who played an organ valued at $12,000. At one point, there was also a ten-piece orchestra led by Frank Ullenberg. The Riviera contained a fully rigged stage with two dressing rooms. These features were evidence of the neighborhood vaudeville and dramatic performances envisioned by the management. Rather than follow the pattern of photoplay parlors and by having an elaborate facade to attract customers to a plain interior, the Riviera had a relatively plain facade and an elaborate interior. The seating capacity was 1,200. In the Riviera, a rare form of construction unique to Milwaukee was used: the \\"stadium style\\" balcony where one could walk from the main floor seats directly up to the balcony. Kosciuszko Park Kosciuszko Park with the lagoon and Basilica One of the south side of Milwaukee's largest public parks, Kosciuszko Park, is located in the Lincoln Village neighborhood. Originally known as Lincoln Avenue Park and locally known as \\"Kosy,\\" the park is a gathering place that has been vital to the health of the neighborhood for over a century. As the densest populated neighborhood in Wisconsin, the park serves a variety of recreational activities for Milwaukee's urban residents - soccer, youth football, fishing, the Pelican Cove water park, and the Kosy Community Center which offers boxing, basketball, and community events. Kosy Park once was the home of the Kosciuszko Reds, a franchise of the Polish- American Semiprofessional Baseball League. The Reds played until 1919 and routinely drew crowds into the thousands.  Kosciuszko Monument  Kosciuszko Monument on W. Lincoln Ave. At the intersection of South 9th Place and West Lincoln Ave. is one of Milwaukee's oldest sculptures. In honor of Polish-American hero General Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko, the Lincoln Village Polish community commissioned the bronze monument's construction in 1904. Designed and constructed by Italian sculptor Gaetano Trentanove, the monument was completed in 1905. It was then moved to its current site and re-mounted on a marble pedestal in 1950. Funds for the monument's construction were collected as personal donations from Lincoln Village residents. These donations were as little as 5 cents, but the Polish community was able to raise over $13,000 which is equivalent to $344,000 in 2009 dollars. Further impressive of this community's fund raising campaign is that it occurred immediately after a similar fund raising campaign for the construction of the Basilica of St. Josaphat in 1901. Before World War II, a pair of Dahlgren coastal defense cannon sat on garrison carriages on either side of the monument.UWM Digital Collections. Kosciuszko Monument, Kosciuszko Park, Milwaukee, Wis., c1907-1930 They are no longer there and their whereabouts are unknown. Also in 1950, the City of Milwaukee filled the structure with concrete in an effort to fortify the monument. Over time, this concrete has expanded and damaged the monument from the inside. Further surface damage has occurred over time due to harsh Wisconsin winters. Local community groups are working together to raise funds to repair the monument in the same manner that the local Polish community took to raise funds to construct the monument.http://www.rkmmilwaukee.org Gallery File:Basilica of St. Josaphat.jpg|Basilica of St. Josaphat, on Lincoln and 5th St. File:SaintJosaphatBasilica.JPG|The Basilica of Saint Josaphat.

Founded on July 16, 1790, the city is the capital of the United States. Washington, D.C., has been the site of military battles, deadly duels, assassinations, untimely deaths, and associated tragedies. Washington's haunted history is so well known that some of its haunted locations were featured in a 2006 documentary, America's Haunted Houses, on the A&E; cable network. Novelist Dan Brown mentioned them prominently in his 2009 novel, The Lost Symbol. Notable purportedly haunted locations include the United States Capitol, Capitol Hill, the White House, Lafayette Square and nearby buildings, Independence Avenue SW, The Octagon House, Chinatown, the National Theatre, Hay‚ÄìAdams Hotel, Woodrow Wilson House, Omni Shoreham Hotel, and many others. The United States Capitol is reputedly haunted by many past representatives of the United States House of Representatives and government officials, officers who served during the American Revolutionary War, workers who died during its construction and a \\"demon black cat\\" that is said to make appearances just before national tragedies or changes in Presidential administration. A very high number of apparitions of deceased American presidents have been reported in the White House, the most famous of which is Abraham Lincoln, reported even by later presidents such as Harry S. Truman, and apparitions of presidents Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and John Tyler have all been witnessed, as have the spirits of many First Ladies. The President's Park, Lafayette Park, and nearby buildings are reported to be home to ghosts such as Philip Barton Key II and Stephen Decatur who died there following pistol duels. The Octagon is supposedly one of the most haunted buildings in D.C., with sightings of its past occupants and African American slaves who once worked there. The National Theatre is said to be haunted by the ghost of actor John McCullough, who was murdered in the 1880s by a fellow thespian. Hay‚ÄìAdams Hotel is claimed to be host to the ghost of Marian \\"Clover\\" Hooper Adams, the wife of Henry Brooks Adams, the celebrated 19th-century American journalist, historian and novelist, who was the grandson of John Quincy Adams, and the Woodrow Wilson House is allegedly haunted by former president Woodrow Wilson himself who spent his final years in illness there before dying in his bedroom in 1924. Houses in the Georgetown area of the city are reported to be haunted by figures from colonial times, including slaves, merchants and children. Staff and guests of the Omni Shoreham Hotel have told of stories of faint voices, cold breezes, and doors slamming shut and opening and televisions and lights turning on and off of their own accord. Capitol Hill The Capitol The United States Capitol is considered one of the most haunted buildings in Washington.French, Joseph Lewis. The Best Ghost Stories. New York: Boni and Liveright, Inc., 1919.Cosgrove-Mather, Bootie. \\"Haunted House On The Hill.\\" CBS News. October 31, 2003. The first apparition to be seen there was in the 1860s as the Capitol was being completed.Alexander, John. Ghosts: Washington's Most Famous Ghost Stories. Arlington, Va.: The Washington Book Trading Co., 1988. Several spirits are said to haunt the Capitol due to tragedies associated with its construction. One such ghost is said to be that of a worker who died after a fall during the construction of the rotunda, and who now is occasionally seen floating beneath the dome carrying a tray of woodworking tools. Another spirit is allegedly a stonemason who died (crushed to death beneath a wall which collapsed, or murdered by a co-worker) and is seen in the Old Senate chambers or passing through a wall in the basement beneath the Senate.Norman, Michael and Scott, Beth. Historic Haunted America. Reprint ed. New York: Macmillan, 2007. National Statuary Hall, said to be haunted by a number of former members of Congress Many politicians with strong personalities and a powerful attachment to the institution of Congress are reputed still to roam the halls of Congress long after their deaths. The shades of Representative Joseph Cannon (R-Ill. and Speaker from 1903 to 1911) and Rep. Champ Clark (D-Mo. and Speaker from 1911 to 1919) are claimed to occasionally return to the dark chamber of the House of Representatives after midnight and, after a loud rap from a gavel, resume the strong, angry debates they once had in life. Members of the United States Capitol Police have claimed to have seen Senator (and from 1852 to 1854, Representative) Thomas Hart Benton sitting at a desk in National Statuary Hall, although it has not been used as a legislative chamber since 1857.Bardes, Barbara A.; Shelley, Mack C.; and Schmidt, Steffen W. American Government and Politics Today: The Essentials. 15th ed. Florence, Ky.: Cengage Learning, 2008. Steve Livengood, chief tour guide for the United States Capitol Historical Society, says he has seen the ghost of former Representative Wilbur Mills (D-Ark.) near Mills' former office late at night.Jordan, Elizabeth. \\"Ghosts Wander the Hill.\\" Roll Call. July 13, 2009. Pierre Charles L'Enfant, although not a politician, was a brevet Major during the American Revolutionary War who served with George Washington at Valley Forge.Jusserand, Jean Jules. Major L'Enfant and the Federal City. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1916; Bowling, Kenneth R. Peter Charles L'Enfant: Vision, Honor, and Male Friendship in the Early American Republic. Washington, D.C.: George Washington University, 2002. OCLC 51037796 In 1791, L'Enfant was appointed architect and planner of the new city of Washington in the District of Columbia. Although L'Enfant submitted grandiose plans for the new capital city, his plans were never fully adopted and President Washington dismissed him. L'Enfant spent much of the rest of his life attempting to wrest a monetary payment from Congress, and he died in poverty in 1825. Eyewitnesses, however, claim to have seen his spirit walking through the Capitol, head down, murmuring to himself, with the plans for the capital city tucked under his arm.Miller, William and Leighton, Frances Spatz. Fishbait: The Memoirs of the Congressional Doorkeeper. New York: Prentice- Hall, 1977. The Capitol has also been witness to murder and death. Rep. William P. Taulbee had been a congressman from Kentucky from 1884 to 1888.Office of the Clerk.

Kentucky Justice, Southern Honor, and American Manhood: Understanding the Life and Death of Richard Reid. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2003. Charles E. Kincaid, a journalist for The Louisville Times, had accused Taulbee of adultery and involvement in a Patent Office scandal, which had ruined Taulbee's political career. On February 28, 1890, the ex-congressman and the reporter ran into one another in the Capitol, and Taulbee assaulted and embarrassed Kincaid by tweaking the much smaller man's nose. Kincaid ran home, grabbed a pistol, and, when he encountered Taulbee on a marble staircase leading from the House chamber down to the dining room, shot him in the face just below Taulbee's left eye. Taulbee died two weeks later, and Kincaid was acquitted after claiming self-defense. Journalists and others claim that whenever a reporter slips on these steps, Taulbee's ghost briefly appears.Taylor, Troy. Wicked Washington: Mysteries, Murder & Mayhem in America's Capital. Charleston, S.C.: The History Press, 2007. Former President and then-Rep. John Quincy Adams suffered a stroke at his desk in the House chamber on February 21, 1848, and was taken into the Speaker's Room.Widmer, Edward L. Ark of the Liberties: America and the World. New York: Hill and Wang. ; Remini, Robert Vincent. John Quincy Adams. New York: Times Books, 2002. His physical condition was too precarious to permit him to be moved, and he died at the Capitol two days later. Many people claim to have heard Adams' ghost denouncing slavery late at night in National Statuary Hall, and one Congressional staff member claims that by standing in the spot where Adams' desk once stood a person can still hear the former president's ghostly whisper. James A. Garfield was a member of the House from 1863 to 1881 before assuming the Presidency in March 1881.Reeves, Thomas C. Gentleman Boss. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1975. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau, a disgruntled office seeker, on July 2, 1881, at 9:30 a.m. as he walked through the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington, D.C. Garfield died of heart failure brought about by blood poisoning (itself caused by poor medical care) on September 19, 1881, while recuperating at a beach house near Long Branch, New Jersey. Witnesses have seen Garfield's specter walking solemnly through the halls of Congress. Not all Capitol hauntings are related to people who worked there. The \\"Demon Cat\\" is alleged to prowl the halls of Congress, and make appearances just before a national tragedy or change in Presidential administration.Rainbolt, Dusty. Ghost Cats: Human Encounters with Feline Spirits. Guilford, Conn.: Globe Pequot, 2007. and Yager, Jordy. \\"Haunted House ‚Äî and Senate.\\" The Hill. March 3, 2009. It was first seen in the early part of the 19th century, and a night watchman shot at it in 1862. It has also been seen by other night watchmen and members of the Capitol Police. It appeared before the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, the October 1929 stock market crash, and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The cat has not only been seen in the halls, but has repeatedly appeared in Washington's Tomb. The Tomb (two levels below the crypt beneath the Capitol Rotunda) was an original feature of the Capitol, planned as a resting place for George Washington and members of his family.Moore, John Leo. Speaking of Washington: Facts, Firsts, and Folklore. Washington, D.C.: Congressional Quarterly, 1993. ; Aikman, Lonnelle. We, the People: The Story of the United States Capitol, Its Past and Its Promise. 13th ed. Washington, D.C.: United States Capitol Historical Society, 1985. The Washington family politely declined the offer. The Tomb stands empty, although from 1865 to 2009 (when it was moved to the United States Capitol Visitor Center) the Lincoln catafalque was stored there. The specters of at least two soldiers are also said to haunt the Capitol. A few eyewitnesses have claimed that whenever an individual lies in state in the Capitol Rotunda, a World War I doughboy momentarily appears, salutes, then disappears. A second apparition, which eyewitnesses say is the ghost of an American Revolutionary War soldier, has also appeared at the Washington Tomb. According to several stories, the soldier appears, moves around the Lincoln catafalque, and then passes out the door into the hallway before disappearing. Capitol Hill Commandant's House at the Marine Corps Barracks, allegedly haunted by the ghost of the first Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps Capitol Hill is one of the largest and most densely populated neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. It is bounded by F Street NE on the north and Southeast/Southwest Freeway on the south. The U.S. Capitol marks its western boundary, while the Anacostia River is its eastern limit. Although Capitol Hill has been home to many of the city's powerful, its hauntings appear to be few. One ghost, however, is said to haunt First Street NE. Joseph Holt was Judge Advocate General of the United States Army from 1862 to 1875.\\"Holt, Joseph (1804‚Äì1894).\\" In Andrew Johnson: A Biographical Companion. Glenna R. Schroeder-Lein and Richard Zuczek, eds. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2001. He presided over the trials of the Lincoln assassination conspirators. During the trials, accused conspirators Dr. Samuel Mudd (who treated John Wilkes Booth's broken leg) and Mary Surratt (at whose downtown boarding house the conspirators met) were held at the Old Capitol Prison opposite the U.S. Capitol (the modern day United States Supreme Court Building stands on the site today).Green, Constance M. Washington: Village and Capital, 1800‚Äì1878. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1962.Chamlee, Roy Z. Lincoln's Assassins: A Complete Account of Their Capture, Trial, and Punishment. Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 1990. After Holt retired, he allegedly became a recluse in his Capitol Hill home.Cohen, Daniel. Civil War Ghosts. New York: Scholastic Inc., 1999. Although the Holt house no longer exists, local residents have told stories of Holt's ghost walking down First Street NE in a blue suit and cape, pondering the guilt of Mudd and Surrat as he heads for the site of the Old Capitol Prison. Capitol Hill's other hauntings are associated with the two military installations in that part of the city. At the official residence of the Commandant of the Marine Corps Barracks and Parade Ground on 8th Street SE, there are stories which talk about rustling papers, the sound of a man pacing, and the appearance of the ghostly image of Samuel Nicholas, the first Commandant of the Marine Corps.Caggiula, Samuel M.; Brackett, Beverly; and King, Gilbert. City in Time: Washington. New York: Sterling Publishing Company, 2008. At the nearby Washington Navy Yard at 8th Street SE and M Street SE, the ghost of Commodore Thomas Tingey is said to stare out of the upper windows of the Tingey House (the traditional residence of the Commander of the Navy Yard).Peck, Taylor. Round-Shot to Rockets: A History of the Washington Navy Yard and U.S. Naval Gun Factory. Annapolis: United States Naval Institute, 1949. Local residents and press reports also tell stories about \\"Old Howard,\\" a cantankerous former U.S. Marine who lived in the 1860s in a two-story house between G and I Streets SE who now haunts it, harassing the occupants and acting much like a poltergeist. White House and President's Park White House The East Room of the White House, where Abigail Adams once hung her laundry and where her spirit may still appear The White House is the oldest building on President's Park. An integral part of the planned city that is Washington, D.C., a design was chosen and construction begun in 1792, and the building (although unfinished) was opened for occupancy on November 1, 1800.Whitcomb, Claire. Real Life at the White House: 200 Years of Daily Life at America's Most Famous Residence. New York: Routledge, 2002. The first people to occupy the building were President John Adams and his wife, Abigail. Parts of the mansion were unfinished, including the cavernous East Room.Gould, Lewis L. American First Ladies: Their Lives and Their Legacy. 2d ed. Florence, Ky.: Taylor & Francis, 2001. With no running water (it was not installed until 1834), water had to be brought into the house by jug and heated for bathing or laundry to be done.Anthony, Carl Sferrazza. America's First Families: An Inside View of 200 Years of Private Life in the White House. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2000. Abigail Adams often hung the family's laundry up to dry in the drafty East Room. The ghost of Abigail Adams has been seen since shortly after her death in 1818, arms extended as if she were still carrying laundry into the East Room, accompanied by the smell of soap or damp clothing.\\"With Election Looming, Washington Is A Ghost Town ‚Äì Literally.\\" Reuters. October 24, 2000. Household staff in the Taft administration even observed her walking through walls.Holzer, Hans. Hans Holzer's Haunted America. Wheaton, Ill.: Barnes & Noble Books, 1993. Abraham Lincoln Abraham Lincoln The White House's most famous alleged apparition is that of Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt also said that the family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them.Parks, Lillian Rogers. My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House. New York: Fleet Publishing Corp., 1961. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping at the door of the Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill,Garber, Marjorie B. Profiling Shakespeare. Florence, Ky.: Routledge, 2008. Theodore Roosevelt,Peterson, Merrill D. Lincoln in American Memory. Reprint ed. New York: Oxford University Press US, 1995. and Maureen Reagan and her husbandReagan, Maureen. First Father, First Daughter: A Memoir. New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2001. have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted).Belanger, Jeff. The World's Most Haunted Places: From the Secret Files of Ghostvillage.com. New York: Career Press, 2004. Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).Pederson, William D. and Williams, Frank J. Franklin D. Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln: Competing Perspectives on Two Great Presidencies. Armonk, N.Y.: M.E. Sharpe, 2002. W. Haden Blackman. The Field Guide to North American Hauntings: Everything You Need to Know About Encountering Over 100 Ghosts, Phantoms, and Spectral Entities. New York: Three Rivers Press, 1998. The last sighting of Lincoln's ghost was in the early 1980s, when Tony Savoy, White House operations foreman, came into the White House and saw Lincoln sitting in a chair at the top of some stairs. Willie Lincoln, who died in the White House during his father's presidency Abraham Lincoln is not the only Lincoln ghost witnesses claim to have seen in the White House. Willie Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln's 11-year-old son, died in the White House of typhoid on February 20, 1862.Donald, David Herbert. Lincoln. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1995. Willie Lincoln's ghost was first seen in the White House by staff members of the Grant administration in the 1870s, but has appeared as recently as the 1960s (President Lyndon B. Johnson's college-age daughter, Lynda Bird Johnson Robb, saw the ghost and claims to have talked to him). Other presidents Other presidents, as well as First Ladies, are also said to haunt the White House. Witnesses in the past two centuries have reported that Thomas Jefferson can be heard playing his violin in the Yellow Oval Room. President Andrew Jackson is said to be seen lying on what is thought to be his old bed Levy, Leonard Williams and Fisher, Louis. Encyclopedia of the American Presidency. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1994. in the Queens' Bedroom (also known as the Rose Room), and his guttural laugh has been heard in the White House since the beginning of the 1860s. First Lady press secretary Liz Carpenter heard the laugh and swore it was Jackson's, and Mary Todd Lincoln claimed to have heard the stomping and swearing of an invisible presence which she claimed was the uncouth Jackson.Leaf, Jesse. The Everything Family Guide to Washington D.C.: All the Best Hotels, Restaurants, Sites, and Attractions. 3rd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: Everything Books, 2007. White House seamstress Lillian Rogers Parks said she was sewing in the Queen's Bedroom and felt a presence, cold air, and then a hand on the back of her chair. She quickly left the room, and for the rest of her time in the White House she refused to enter the room again without at least one other person accompanying her. The spirit of William Henry Harrison, it is claimed, haunts the attic, and President John Tyler allegedly haunts the Blue Room. First Lady Frances Folsom Cleveland, who was married to President Grover Cleveland in the White House's Blue Room in 1886,Robar, Stephen F. Frances Clara Folsom Cleveland. New York: Nova Publishers, 2004. is widely claimed to haunt the room where she was married and was seen there after her death in 1947. Non-residents The White House is also said to be visited by three specters who did not live there. The first is that of David Burns, who owned the ground on which the White House stands before selling it to the federal government in May 1791, and whose spirit has been seen in Oval Office. A reporter told a security guard during the Truman administration that, while standing in the Yellow Oval Room, he heard a faint ghostly voice which said, \\"I'm Mr. Burns.\\" The second spirit is allegedly that of a British soldier dressed in a uniform from the War of 1812 and carrying a torch. In August 1814, a combined British land and naval force captured Washington, D.C., and set fire to the White House, Treasury Building, Capitol, and other buildings in retaliation for the American looting of York, Upper Canada (now the city of Toronto) and the burning of the Parliament Buildings of Upper Canada after the Battle of York in 1813.Hickey, Donald R. The War of 1812: The Forgotten Conflict. Urbana, Ill.: University of Illinois Press, 1990. ; Pitch, Anthony S. The Burning of Washington. Annapolis: Naval Institute Press, 2000. The fires were put out only when a hurricane and tornado passed through Washington the following day, extinguishing the blazes. The soldier is claimed to be one of those who burned the White House, or who lost his life the following day in the storm. Another shade alleged to visit the White House is the ghost of Anna Surratt, daughter of convicted Lincoln assassination co-conspirator Mary Surratt, who forced her way into the White House the night before her mother's execution and unsuccessfully begged for her mother's life.Holloway, Laura Carter. The Ladies of the White house: or, In the Home of the Presidents. Philadelphia, Pa.: Bradley, Garretson, & Company, 1883; Goodrich, Thomas. The Darkest Dawn: Lincoln, Booth, and the Great American Tragedy. Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 2006. It is claimed by some White House staff that Anna's ghost returns to the White House every July 6, silently banging on the front door to seek entrance and continue her futile pleas for her mother's life. President's Park and nearby buildings Decatur House on Lafayette Square, showing the bricked-up window out of which the ghost of Stephen Decatur is said to stare President's Park, better known as Lafayette Square, may have its own spectral resident. Philip Barton Key II was the son of Francis Scott Key and the nephew of Chief Justice Roger B. Taney.Walther, Eric H. The Shattering of the Union: America in the 1850s. New York: Rowman & Littlefield, 2004. In the spring of 1858, Key began having an affair with Teresa Bagioli Sickles, the wife of his friend Daniel Sickles.Gallagher, Gary W. Three Days at Gettysburg: Essays on Confederate and Union Leadership. Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1999. On February 26, 1859, Sickles learned of the affair. The following day, he saw Key in Lafayette Square signalling to his wife. Sickles rushed out into the park, drew a pistol, and shot the unarmed Key three times while the other man pleaded for his life. Key was taken into the nearby Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House and died moments later. Key's spirit, eyewitnesses and authors claim, now haunts Lafayette Square and can be seen on dark nights near the spot where he was shot.Apkarian-Russell, Pamela. Washington's Haunted Past: Capital Ghosts of America. Charleston, S.C.: The History Press, 2006. Decatur House (748 Jackson Place NW) is allegedly haunted by the ghost of Stephen Decatur. In 1820, Commodore James Barron challenged Commodore Decatur to a duel over comments Decatur had made regarding Barron's conduct in the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair of 1807.Decatur had served on the court-martial that had found Barron guilty of unpreparedness, and had barred him from a command for the next five years. See: De Kay, James Tertius. A Rage for Glory: The Life of Commodore Stephen Decatur, USN. New York: Free Press, 2004. The two men duelled on March 20, and Decatur was mortally wounded in the stomach.De Kay, A Rage for Glory: The Life of Commodore Stephen Decatur, USN, 2004. Decatur was rushed back to his home, and died there on March 22. A year after Decatur's death, his ghost reportedly began appearing at the house‚Äîstanding in a second floor window looking out at H Street NW or leaving the back door of the house with a box of dueling pistols.Ogden, Tom. The Complete Idiot's Guide to Ghosts and Hauntings. New York: Alpha Books, 1999. So many witnesses saw the specter of Decatur that the window was walled up. Some people have also claimed that they can hear his widow, who became hysterical at his death, weeping in the house. President's pew of St. John's Episcopal Church St. John's Episcopal Church (1525 H Street NW), built in 1816, is the second-oldest structure on the President's Park.Grimmett, Richard F. St. John's Church, Lafayette Square: The History and Heritage of the Church of the Presidents, Washington, D.C. Minneapolis, Minn.: Hillcrest Publishing Group, 2009. The church has a tradition of a \\"President's pew,\\" which is reserved for the use of the President of the United States. The church's bell was purchased from the Revere Company of Boston (founded by Joseph Warren Revere, son of Paul Revere) and installed on November 30, 1822 (where it remains ). According to at least two accounts, whenever the bell tolls because of the death of a notable person, six ghostly men in white robes appear in the President's pew at midnight and then vanish. The west side of the Dolley Madison House, showing the porch (with black railing) where the shade of the former First Lady is said to rock on dark nights The Cutts-Madison House (721 Madison Place NW),Benedetto, Robert; Donovan, Jane; and Du Vall, Kathleen. Historical Dictionary of Washington. New York: Rowman & Littlefield, 2003. also known as the Dolley Madison House, was constructed in 1822 by Richard Cutts, brother- in-law of First Lady Dolley Madison.Bednar, Michael J. L'Enfant's Legacy: Public Open Spaces in Washington. Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006.

Wilkes moved the entrance from Madison Place NW to H Street NW, and turned the porch on the west side of the house (facing Madison Place NW) into a window. Witnesses from the mid-19th century onward have claimed to have seen the ghost of Dolley Madison rocking in a chair in the space where the porch used to be, smiling at passersby.Thomsen, Brian M. Oval Office Occult: True Stories of White House Weirdness. Kansas City: Andrews McMeel Publishing, 2008. Downtown The Octagon House The Octagon is supposedly one of the most haunted buildings in D.C.

The Octagon: Being an Account of a Famous Washington Residence, Its Great Years, Decline & Restoration. Washington, D.C.: American Institute of Architects Foundation, 1976. The Tayloes were a greatly distinguished Virginia family: His grandfather, Colonel John Tayloe (d. 1747), was a member of the King's Council in Virginia and owner of more than of land (a huge estate at the time), and his father, Colonel John Tayloe II, built the historic Mount Airy manor house in 1758 and was also a member of the King's Council.\\"Old Letters From Virginia County Records.\\" William and Mary College Quarterly Historical Magazine. 11:3 (January 1903); Sale, Edith Tunis.

July 9, 1898. John Tayloe III was a close friend of George Washington's, and Washington convinced Tayloe to build a winter home in the new city of Washington. There is some evidence that the walled back yard of The Octagon itself may have served as a slave market,The District of Columbia was \\"home to the largest slave market in North America\\", and the city contained four or five very large slave markets as well as numerous smaller \\"slave pens\\" in nearly every neighborhood and rural area of the District.

Guilford, Conn.: Globe Pequot, 2004, p. 49. and it is well-established that the rear of the building housed the Tayloe family's slaves.Gutheim, Frederick Albert. Worthy of the Nation: Washington, DC, From L'Enfant to the National Capital Planning Commission. 2d ed. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006. The Tayloe family was exceptionally well-connected, and their home was an important one in the city. After the burning of the White House in the War of 1812, President James and Dolley Madison lived there from September 1814 to October 1815, and Madison signed the Treaty of Ghent (which ended the war) there in February 1815.Haas, Irvin. Historic Homes of the American Presidents. 2d ed. North Chelmsford, Mass.:Courier Dover Publications, 1991. ; Moore, Virginia. The Madisons: A Biography. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1979. Apparitions and the presence of otherworldly forces have been seen and felt in many places at The Octagon, including on the spiral staircase, the second floor landing, the third floor landing, the third floor bedroom, and the garden area in the rear. Among the eyewitnesses have been members of the public, and curators and other employees hired by the museum which owns the house. Two of Colonel Tayloe's daughters are said to haunt The Octagon.Whitman, William B. Washington, D.C. Off the Beaten Path: A Guide to Unique Places. 4th ed. Guilford, Conn.: Globe Pequot, 2007. The first allegedly died before the War of 1812. Colonel Tayloe and his daughter quarreled on the second floor landing over the girl's relationship with a British officer stationed in the city. When the daughter turned in anger to go down the stairs, she fell down the stairs (or over the railing; stories differ) and died. Her specter is allegedly seen crumpled at the bottom of the steps or on the stairs near the second floor landing, and sometimes exhibits itself as the light of a candle moving up the staircase.Floyd, Randall. In the Realm of Ghosts and Hauntings. Augusta, Ga.: Harbor House, 2002. The other death, stories claim, occurred in 1817 or shortly thereafter. Another of Colonel Tayloe's daughters eloped with a young man, incurring her father's wrath. When she returned home to reconcile with her father, they argued on the third-floor landing. This daughter, too, fell to her death down the stairs (or over the railing), and her shade is alleged to haunt the third floor landing and stairs between the second and third floors. The Octagon is also believed by some to be haunted by the spirits of African American slaves who once lived there. When the house held bells to summon servants, the spirits of the dead slaves would announce their presence by ringing these bells loudly.Lockwood, Mary Smith. Historic Homes in Washington: Its Noted Men and Women. New York: Belford Company, 1889. The ghostly bell ringing first occurred in the 1870s. General George D. Ramsay, Chief of Ordnance for the United States Army and commander of the Washington Arsenal in Washington, D.C., was attending a dinner at The Octagon when all the bells in the house began ringing. As Marian Gouverneur, wife of Samuel Laurence Gouverneur, Jr. (the first American consul in Foo Chow, China), related the story, General Ramsay seized the bell ropes to stop the bells from sounding, but to everyone's shock they did not stop ringing.Gouverneur, Marian. As I Remember: Recollections of American Society During the Nineteenth Century. New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1911. Although Gouverneur's report was not made until 1911, the mysterious ringing of the bells had been reported in 1874Clemmer, Mary. Ten Years in Washington: Life and Scenes in the National Capital as a Woman Sees Them. Cincinnati: Queen City Publishing Company, 1874. and again in 1889, each time attributed to the spirits of dead slaves. Other spirits are also said to remain at The Octagon as well. Dolley Madison's spirit has been seen near the fireplace in the main ballroom as well as heading through a closed door to the garden, and her ghost's presence is accompanied by the smell of lilacs, her favorite flower.Let's Go Washington. New York: Macmillan, 2003. A slave girl in the house was allegedly thrown from the third floor landing to the first floor below and killed by a British soldier during the War of 1812, and eyewitnesses have reported hearing her scream.Evelyn, Douglas E.; Dickson, Paul; and Ackerman, S.J. On This Spot: Pinpointing the Past in Washington, D.C. 3rd rev. ed. Dulles, Va.: Capital Books, 2008. The specter of a British soldier in War of 1812 dress was seen by caretaker James Cypress in the 1950s, and museum superintendent Alric H. Clay claimed that in the 1960s spirits would often turn on the lights and open The Octagon's doors late at night. A gambler shot to death in the house's third-floor bedroom in the late 19th century has sometimes been seen still in the bed he died in, and ghostly footmen have been seen at the front door waiting to receive guests. He was said to have rung a bell shortly before his death and that the ring of the bell often heard in the house is from him. Various witnesses have also reported hearing assorted moans, screams, and footsteps. Independence Avenue SW Wilbur Wright FAA HQ - probable site for Yellow House slave pen The spirits of slaves are also said to haunt a portion of Independence Avenue SW, the site of two of the city's largest and most notorious slave markets. The Yellow House or Williams Slave Pen (at about 800 Independence Avenue SW, now the site of the headquarters of the Federal Aviation Administration) was the most notorious slave pen in the capital: A modest, well-maintained, two-story yellow house concealed a very large basement in which slaves were chained to walls in windowless rooms, while a yard surrounded by a high brick wall provided space for the training and selling of slaves.Blackman, Ann. Wild Rose: Rose O'Neale Greenhow, Civil War Spy. Reprint ed. New York: Random House, 2006. ; Bangura, Abdul Karim. Historical Political Economy of Washington. Latham, Md.: University Press of America, 2000. Another large slave market, the Robey Slave Pen, was just a block away at the corner of 7th Street SW and Independence Avenue SW.Goode, James W. Capital Losses: A Cultural History of Washington's Destroyed Buildings. 2d ed. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Books, 2003. ; Deyle, Steven. Carry Me Back: The Domestic Slave Trade in American Life. New York: Oxford University Press US, 2005. On dark nights, witnesses say they have heard the clinking of chains and screams on Independence Avenue where these slave pens used to operate.Rooney, E. Ashley and Johnston, Betsy. Washington, D.C.: Ghosts, Legends, and Lore. Atglen, Pa.: Schiffer Publishing, 2008. Chinatown Mary Surratt's boarding house in Chinatown, Washington, D.C. The intersection of 7th Street NW and H Street NW is the heart of D.C.'s Chinatown neighborhood today, but prior to the 1930s it was populated primarily by German immigrants.Brown, Jules. Rough Guide to Washington DC. 3d ed. New York: Rough Guides, 2002. ; Price, Marie and Benton-Short, Lisa. Migrants to the Metropolis: The Rise of Immigrant Gateway Cities. Syracuse, N.Y.: Syracuse University Press, 2008. Before the American Civil War, 7th Street NW was the city's primary commercial district, the street lined with three-story Federal-style townhouses with shops on the ground floor and residences above.Penczer, Peter R. Washington, D.C., Past and Present. Arlington, Va.: Oneonta Press, 1998. Lincoln conspirator Mary Surratt's boarding house (604 H Street NW) has been substantially renovated through the years (and currently houses a Chinese restaurant), but it is also said to house Mary Surratt's ghost. From the 1870s onward, occupants of the building have claimed that Surratt's spirit is responsible for the incomprehensible mumbling and whispers, footsteps, muffled sobs, and creaking floorboards which have unnerved them.Taylor, L.B. The Ghosts of Virginia. Williamsburg, Va.: Virginia Ghosts, 1996. National Theatre and National Building Museum At least three other sites in downtown D.C. are also reputed to be haunted. The National Theatre (1321 Pennsylvania Avenue NW) opened at its current location on December 7, 1835, although the old building was torn down and replaced with the current structure in 1923.Lee, Douglas Bennett; Meersman, Roger L.; and Murphy, Donn B. Stage for a Nation: The National Theatre, 150 Years. Lanham, Md.: Publisher University Press of America, 1985. Nonetheless, some claim the theater is haunted by the ghost of actor John McCullough, who was murdered in the 1880s by a fellow thespian where the modern stage is located today.Wurman, Richard Saul. Washington, DC Access. 3d ed. New York: Access Press, 1992. The spook was first sighted by Frederic Bond, a comic actor and friend of McCullough's, in September 1896. Bond was on the stage late at night reviewing preparations for the next day's performance when he felt a spectral presence that terrified him. He then saw a ghostly figure dressed in the traditional garb of the Shakespearean character Hamlet. Recognizing the spirit, he shouted McCullough's name and the ghost vanished.Moran, Mark and Sceurman, Mark. Weird U.S.: Your Travel Guide to America's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets. New York: Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., 2004. ; Wilmeth, Don B. and Bigsby, C.W.E. The Cambridge History of American Theatre. Reprint ed. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999. The National Building Museum (401 F Street NW), too, is allegedly haunted. Built in 1887 in order to process pensions for Civil War veterans, widows, and orphans (such pensions consumed a quarter of the federal budget at the time), the \\"Pension Building\\" (as it was originally known) contains 15 Corinthian columns made of brick and plaster and painted to imitate black onyx.Moeller, Gerard and Weeks, Christopher. AIA Guide to the Architecture of Washington, D.C. 4th ed. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006. Security guards and other witnesses have claimed that the swirling colors of the columns can change to form the outlines of people who have recently died, or who had ties to the building. When in use as the headquarters of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia in the 1940s, night watchmen reported seeing a man on horseback on the upper floors, where horses used to be quartered during the Civil War. They also reported seeing the ghost of James Tanner, a stenographer who took down the testimony of eyewitnesses after the assassination of President Lincoln at Ford's Theater (ironically, Robert Todd Lincoln approved the plans for the Pension Building). These stories gained such prominence that mystery writer Margaret Truman mentioned them in one of her novels.Truman, Margaret. Murder on the Potomac. Reprint ed. New York: Random House, 1995. p. 314. Hay-Adams Hotel Hay- Adams Hotel The Hay‚ÄìAdams Hotel may also be host to the ghost of Marian \\"Clover\\" Hooper Adams. She was the wife of Henry Brooks Adams, the celebrated 19th-century American journalist, historian, academic and novelist who was the grandson of John Quincy Adams.Friedrich, Otto. Clover: The Tragic Love Story of Clover and Henry Adams and Their Brilliant Life in America's Gilded Age. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1979. She married Henry Adams on June 27, 1872, and in 1877 the couple moved to Washington, D.C., and rented the Slidell House at 1607 H Street NW.Wills, Garry. Henry Adams and the Making of America. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 2005. Their home became a salon for the capital's literati and politically powerful. In 1881, the Adamses purchased a lot on the northwest corner of 16th Street NW and H Street NW on Lafayette Square, and with their friend John Hay began building the famous Hay-Adams Houses‚Äîtwo of the most architecturally important private residences ever built in the city. Marian Adams' beloved father, to whom she was exceptionally close, died on April 13, 1885, and she sank into a deep depression. Just months before she was to occupy her spacious and luxurious new home, Adams committed suicide on December 6, 1885, by swallowing potassium cyanide. To mark her grave in Rock Creek Cemetery, Henry Adams commissioned sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens and architect Stanford White to create the haunting Adams Memorial with its hooded, robed, androgynous figure formally titled Mystery of the Hereafter and The Peace of God that Passeth Understanding (but which is commonly called Grief). The Hay-Adams Houses were razed in 1927 by real estate developer Harry Wardman, and the Hay-Adams Hotel built on the site. Although Marian Adams never lived in the house where the Hay-Adams Hotel is today, some hotel staff say her specter haunts the site. Housekeepers and other staff have reported being hugged by an invisible presence as well as hearing a woman sobbing.Morgan, David. \\"Check Into a Haunted Hotel This Halloween.\\" ABC News. October 21, 2002. Other mysterious occurrences attributed to the Adams specter include locked doors opening and closing, clock radios turning on and off, and a woman's voice whispering, \\"What do you want?\\" A few witnesses say the ghost is accompanied by the scent of mimosa, Adams' favorite scent. The incidents are located primarily on the hotel's fourth floor,Ihejirika, Maudlyne. \\"Obama's 'Haunted' House.\\" Chicago Sun- Times. January 1, 2009. and occur usually during the first two weeks of December (near the anniversary of Marian Adams' death). Dupont Circle Walsh Mansion The former Walsh Mansion (now the Indonesian Embassy) near Dupont Circle One of the most important buildings in the Dupont Circle neighborhood is the Walsh Mansion (now the Embassy of Indonesia) located at 2020 Massachusetts Avenue NW. Thomas J. Walsh had emigrated penniless from Ireland to the United States in 1869, then over the next quarter century built up a small fortune as a carpenter, miner, and hotel manager.Lorenz, Marjorie. Notorious Women of the West: The Good, the Bad and the Eccentric. Dover, Del.: Cherokee Books, 2005. His first daughter (born in 1880) died in infancy, but his daughter, Evalyn (born in 1886), and son, Vinson (born in 1888), both survived. He lost nearly all his life's savings in the Panic of 1893. The family moved to Ouray, Colorado, in 1896, where Walsh bought the Camp Bird Mine (which was thought to have been worked out) and struck a massive vein of gold and silver.Kurin, Richard. Hope Diamond: The Legendary History of a Cursed Gem. New York: HarperCollins, 2006. Now a multi-millionaire, Thomas Walsh moved his family to Washington, D.C., in 1898. After spending 1899‚Äì1900 in Paris, France, the Walshes returned to Washington where Thomas Walsh commenced the construction of a mansion on Massachusetts Avenue NW.Field, Cynthia R.; Gournay, Isabelle; and Somma, Thomas P. Paris on the Potomac: The French Influence on the Architecture and Art of Washington. Columbus, Ohio: Ohio University Press, 2007. The Walsh Mansion, completed in 1903,Williams, Paul. Dupont Circle. Mount Pleasant, S.C.: Arcadia Publishing, 2000. cost $835,000 (the most expensive residence in the city at the time) and had 60 rooms, a theater, a ballroom, a French salon, a grand staircase, and $2 million in furnishings which took several years to purchase and install. Evalyn Walsh married Edward Beale \\"Ned\\" McLean (the publishing heir whose family owned The Washington Post) in 1908, and after her father's death in April 1910 lived in the Walsh Mansion.James, Edward T. Notable American Women, 1607‚Äì1950: A Biographical Dictionary. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1971. In 1910, Ned McLean bought the allegedly cursed Hope Diamond for his wife for $180,000 (although the purchase was not formalized until February 1911, and not completed until after a lawsuit settled out of court in 1912). Evalyn Walsh died on April 26, 1947. To cover Evalyn's significant debts, the Walsh Mansion was sold in 1952 to the Government of Indonesia for use as an embassy. But according to embassy staff, Evalyn Walsh McLean never vacated the home. Rather, her spirit has been seen several times gliding down the mansion's grand central staircase. A naked lady's spectral form has also been seen from time to time in the mansion, but no one knows who she is.Holzer, Hans. The Ghosts That Walk in Washington. Garden City, New York: Doubleday & Company, Inc., 1971. p.230 Woodrow Wilson House Woodrow Wilson House A second noted house in the Dupont Circle neighborhood which is claimed to be haunted is the Woodrow Wilson House (2340 S Street NW). Woodrow Wilson was elected President of the United States in 1912, was re-elected in 1916 promising to keep the nation out of war, led the nation through World War I, and left office in 1921.Brands, H.W. Woodrow Wilson. New York: Macmillan, 2003. At 2 AM on September 26, 1919, while traveling to Wichita, Kansas, on a nationwide speaking tour to win public support to pressure the Senate into ratifying the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson collapsed and, after cancelling the rest of his speaking tour, was rushed back to the capital by train.Knock, Thomas J.

His condition worsened on the journey, and upon arriving at the White House on October 2 the President suffered a life-threatening stroke that left him permanently paralyzed on his left side and blind in the left eye. Although the President lived, he was confined to bed for two months, seen only by his wife, a few close associates, and his physicians.McDermott, Rose. Presidential Leadership, Illness, and Decision Making. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007. ; Gilbert, Robert E. The Mortal Presidency: Illness and Anguish in the White House. 2d ed. New york: Fordham University Press, 1998. From December 1919 to April 1920 Wilson required a wheelchair. Wilson attended his first Cabinet meeting in April 1920, but for the rest of the year his mind continued to wander, his memory was marred, and he tired easily. By March 1921 (when he left office) Wilson was able to walk short distances with the use of a cane (and with a valet close at hand). The extent of Wilson's disability was kept from the public until after his death on February 3, 1924.Smith, Gene. When the Cheering Stopped: The Last Years of Woodrow Wilson. New York: William Morrow and Company, 1964. President and Mrs. Wilson purchased a large home at 2340 S Street NW, to which a number of modifications were made (including the addition of an elevator). Woodrow Wilson received few guests in his last years, and died in his third floor bedroom on February 3, 1924. His wife, Edith Bolling Galt Wilson, lived in the home until her death on December 28, 1961, and willed the home to the National Trust for Historic Preservation to be made into a museum honoring her husband. In the decades since her death, staff and visitors at the Woodrow Wilson House claim to have seen the President's ghost sitting in his rocking chair, heard the shuffle of a man walking with a cane, and heard a man sob.Conroy, Sarah Booth. \\"The Ghost List; Washington's Spirited Presidential Tradition.\\" Washington Post.

Braddock's expedition was surprised on July 9 in the vicinity of present-day Braddock, Pennsylvania, in what is now known as the Battle of the Monongahela. Nearly 900 of Braddock's 1,300 men were killed or wounded, and Braddock himself killed. Since before the American Civil War, witnesses say that on the anniversary of Braddock's departure they can hear shouted military orders, horses' hooves on cobblestones, the sound of men marching, and the sound of metal clanking against metal.Hauck, Dennis. Haunted Places: The National Directory. 2d ed. New York: Penguin Group, 2002. The sounds can be heard near the old Long Bridge or near the Georgetown bluffs overlooking the Potomac River. Halcyon House Halcyon House (3400 Prospect Street NW) is a mansion originally built in 1787 by Benjamin Stoddert, the first Secretary of the Navy.Moeller, Gerard Martin and Weeks, Christopher.

The original structure was heavily altered over the next 38 years. Clemens believed that perpetually rebuilding the house would extend his life. The coach house was joined to the building, apartments added to the north face and rear, rooms built within rooms, hallways added and then walled off, and even a small crypt added in one room.

Halcyon House is allegedly haunted by the spirits of numerous runaway slaves who died there during their escape to freedom, and whose moans and cries can be heard in the basement. Others claim that the ghost of Benjamin Stoddert has been seen, heard walking through the house, sitting in a chair, or whispering unintelligibly. The spirit of a woman has also been spotted in an upstairs window. A six-year-old visitor claimed that the woman frequently woke him at night by rearranging his covers. Two residents say they have experienced levitation during the night, with their bodies being reversed so that their feet were on the pillow. Unnamed residents have told about lights mysteriously going out and sounds in the attic. The Old Stone House in Georgetown, which allegedly houses a malevolent ghost. The Old Stone House (3051 M Street NW) was built in 1765 by Christopher and Rachel Layman. The house was sold in 1767 to a wealthy widow, Cassandra Chew, who constructed a kitchen in the rear in 1767, and a second floor between 1767 and 1775, and a third floor in the 1790s.Seeber, Barbara H.

These include: A woman in a brown dress standing near the fireplace, a heavy-set woman standing on the staircase and also in the kitchen, a man with long blond hair and wearing a blue jacket, a man wearing short pants and long stockings, a woman in a rocking chair on the third floor, a small boy who runs down the third floor hallway, a man dressed in Colonial-era clothing standing in the master bedroom, a man dressed in Colonial-era clothing seen on the second floor, a young girl with curly hair running up and down the staircase, an African American boy, and a German-looking craftsman. The laughter of invisible children and the translucent images of women cooking in the kitchen have also been observed.Tischler, Gary. \\"Georgetown Haunts Yield Spirited Chills.\\" Washington Times. October 25, 2007. The Old Stone House may also contain one of Washington's only malevolent spirits, nicknamed \\"George,\\" who has choked and pushed visitors and whose presence (often indicated by an extremely cold spot) leaves witnesses with an intense feeling of dread.

Donna Andrews and Maria Y. Lima, eds. Atglen, Pa.: Cornell Maritime Press, 2006. M Street Bridge Bridges in Georgetown may also be the sites of ghostly activity. Two specters are said to haunt the site of the M Street Bridge. M Street NW was known on the Georgetown side as \\"Bridge Street\\" before the street renaming of 1895.Tindall, William. Origin and Government of the District of Columbia. Committee on the District of Columbia. House of Representatives. United States Congress. Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1909. In 1788, a wooden drawbridge was built over Rock Creek to connect Bridge Street with M Street NW in Washington.Myer, Donald Beckman. Bridges and the City of Washington. Washington, D.C.: Commission of Fine Arts, 1974. But the bridge collapsed during a rain storm shortly after it was built, taking a stagecoach full of passengers with it.Federal Writers' Project. Washington, D.C.: A Guide to the Nation's Capital. Washington, D.C.: Federal Writers' Project, 1942. Federal Bridge, a sturdier structure, was built over Rock Creek in 1802. However, from the early 19th century to the early 20th century, Georgetown residents claimed to see a silent stagecoach race down Bridge Street on starless nights, and then disappear in the center of the new span.Peter, Grace Dunlop. A Portrait of Old George Town. Richmond, Va.: Garrett & Massie, 1933. Another apparition said to haunt the bridge was that of a drummer boy who allegedly had been knocked off the bridge (during the American Revolutionary War or in the early 19th century after the bridge had been rebuilt) by a gust of wind and drowned in Rock Creek.Taggart, Hugh T. \\"Old Georgetown.\\" Records of the Columbia Historical Society, Washington, D.C. 1908. On quiet nights, witnesses claimed to hear soft drumming which got louder near the center of the span but disappeared once the spot where the boy drowned was reached. The image of a headless man (whose origins are shrouded in mystery) is said to sometimes haunt the Georgetown side of the K Street NW bridge over Rock Creek as well.

A few months after the Dohertys moved into the apartment, their maid died in the night. A short time later, the Doherty's daughter, Helen, also died in the suite. The Dohertys moved out, and the apartment remained unoccupied for almost 50 years. The apartment was renovated into a hotel suite. But guests and hotel staff began to tell stories of faint voices, cold breezes, doors slamming shut and opening of their own accord, and televisions and lights turning on and off on their own. Guests in adjoining suites would complain of noises coming from the closed and empty Suite 870.

Very little is known about this Emperor due to a lack of material available for further verification and study. Itoku is known as a \\"legendary emperor\\" among historians as his actual existence is disputed. Nothing exists in the Kojiki other than his name and genealogy. Itoku's reign allegedly began in 510 BC, he had one wife and two sons. After his death in 477 BC, his first son supposedly became the next emperor. Legendary narrative In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, only Itoku's name and genealogy were recorded. While the Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, no extant contemporary records have been discovered that confirm a view that this historical figure actually reigned. Itoku is believed to be the son of Emperor Annei, and his mother is believed to have been Nunasoko-Nakatsu-hime. The latter of the two is allegedly the granddaughter of Kotoshiro-Nushi-no-kami. The Kojiki records that Itoku was the second or third son of Emperor Annei, but the surviving documents provide no basis for speculating why the elder brother or brothers were passed over for the throne. He is traditionally believed to have ruled from the palace of at Karu in what would come to be known as Yamato Province. At some point he married a woman named Amonotoyototsu-hime, and fathered two sons with her. Itoku's reign lasted from 510 BC until his death in 477 BC, his son then took the throne and would later be referred to as Emperor K≈çsh≈ç. Known information Memorial Shinto shrine and mausoleum honoring Emperor Itoku. The existence of at least the first nine Emperors is disputed due to insufficient material available for further verification and study. Itoku is thus regarded by historians as a \\"legendary Emperor\\", and is considered to have been the third of eight Emperors without specific legends associated with them. The name Itoku-tenn≈ç was assigned to him posthumously by later generations, and literally means \\"benign virtue\\". His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Itoku, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the Yamato dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the Kojiki. While the actual site of Itoku's grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) in Kashihara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Itoku's mausoleum. It is formally named Unebi-yama no hitsujisaru Mihodo no i no e no misasagi. The first emperor that historians state might have actually existed is Emperor Sujin, the 10th emperor of Japan. Outside of the Kojiki, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( ‚Äì 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as \\"traditional\\" though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.

First Treaty  Although the Treaty of Zuhab in 1639 had established the boundary between Ottoman Empire and Persia, the border in the mountainous Zuhab region remained a site of intermittent conflict in the subsequent two centuries. Tensions between the two empires had been rising due to the Ottoman Empire's harboring of rebellious tribesmen from Persian Azerbaijan. Although secretly, the Russian Empire was attempting to put pressure on the Ottoman Empire, which was at war with the Greeks, who were receiving arms from Russia.A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle, Vol.III, ed. Spencer C. Tucker, (ABC-CLIO, 2010), 1140. Crown Prince Abbas Mirza of Persia, at the instigation of the Russian Empire, invaded Kurdistan and the areas surrounding Persian Azerbaijan.A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle, Vol.III, ed. Spencer C. Tucker, 1140. After the 1821 Battle of Erzurum, both empires signed the first Treaty of Erzurum in July 1823, which confirmed the 1639 border. Also included in the treaty, was the guaranteed access for Persian pilgrims to visit holy sites within the Ottoman Empire.A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle, Vol.III, ed. Spencer C. Tucker, 1140. The treaty regulated the taxes concerning the pilgrims and for the nomadic tribes pasturing their livestock in the borderlands. It was also agreed upon, that the every three years, Persia, as well as the Ottomans would send an envoy to the other country, therefore establishing diplomatic relations with each other.  Second Treaty  A series of border incidents in the 1830s again brought Persia and the Ottoman Empire to the brink of war. Britain and Russia offered to mediate, and a second Treaty of Erzurum was signed on 31 May 1847.Victor Prescott and Gillian D. Triggs, International Frontiers and Boundaries: Law, Politics and Geography (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2008: ), p. 6. This treaty divided the disputed region between the two parties and provided for a boundary commission to delimit the entire border.

The Black Abbey of Kilkenny, Ireland, is a Catholic priory of the Dominican Order, dedicated to the Holy and Undivided Trinity. Black Abbey was established in 1225 as one of the first houses of the Dominican Order in Ireland. The history of the Black Abbey is marked by several reversals of fortune under different governments.  Name  The name Black Abbey derives from the use of the term \\"Black Friars\\" to describe members of the Dominican Order. This in turn derives from the black cappa or cloak which Dominicans wear over their white habits.  Site  When the priory was founded the 13th century, the town of Kilkenny was divided in two parts by the Bregach River. One part was occupied mainly by indigenous Irish (Irishtown) and the other by English (Norman) settlers. The Dominicans established the priory between those two towns and outside the city walls, because they wished to show their independence from either side. In practical terms, the site chosen for the priory presented challenges, because ever since the priory was established, right up to the present time, the buildings are subject to annual flooding from the river. History The interior of Black Abbey, the nave and transept The priory was founded in 1225 by William Marshal the younger, Earl of Pembroke, who died in 1231. In 1349, the community within the priory was affected by the outbreak of bubonic plague - known as the Black Death. Eight members of the community died in three months during this pandemic. After the plague years, very few structural changes were carried out at the priory up until the end of 15th century. In 1558, Ireland was under the rule of Elizabeth I of England, a Protestant queen, and the property of the priory was confiscated by the crown. Elizabeth died in 1603, but the policies of the new Protestant King, James I, did not change: the priory became a courthouse, and the Dominicans were forced to leave and find places to stay in other houses. From 1642 to 1649, Black Abbey played a major part in attempting to save both the Irish Catholic religion and the king, Charles I of England and of Ireland; the abbey hosted the government known as the Irish Catholic Confederation. This effort did not last long however. In March 1650, the English army under the command of Oliver Cromwell surrounded Kilkenny in a siege. Many people died from epidemic and hunger, many more fled before the city finally surrendered. From 1685 to 1689 under the rule of the Catholic king James II of England, the abbey flourished, but in 1690, under the rule of the Protestant king William III of England, both Kilkenny and the abbey were once again occupied by the English. By 1776, the community of the Black Abbey was close to zero, but starting in that year, the Dominicans retook possession of the abbey, first by renting it. In 1816, Black Abbey was restored as a Dominican priory, and the first public mass was held on 25 September 1816. On Trinity Sunday, 22 May 1864, Black Abbey was reconsecrated by the bishop, and was finally opened again as a house of prayer.  Interior thumb thumb In nearly all cases, the main building of monasteries of the Dominicans and Franciscans in Ireland followed the same plan. There was a nave and a choir (pointing east), separated by a tower. From the tower or the nave they had just one transept, pointing to the north or the south, in most cases with one aisle. In some cases, an aisle was also attached to the nave. Black Abbey followed this plan: +---------------------------------+ N  ^ nave tower choir  \\\\+ + + + + +---------+ aisle +-----------+ +south  trans-  + ept   +  +-----------+ ^ +------------- rosary window The original choir fell into ruin, and at the end of the 18th century the stones were used to construct two storey living quarters for the Dominican friars. This structure was used for 120 years. It was demolished to enable the reconstruction of the nave, which made possible the reconsecration of the abbey in 1864. (The south transept was restored first, and before the reconsecration, masses were held there.) The nave leads to the altar below the tower. Immediately behind the altar is the large stained glass window known as the \\"Rosary Window\\", which is composed of five \\"lights\\" or great vertical panels, and is the largest stained glass window in Ireland. This window was created in 1892 by Mayers of Munich, and depicts the Mysteries of the Rosary.

Early life  Udeshi originally wanted to study architecture at a university, but his father preferred a law degree. He compromised on economics at the London School of Economics. After completing his degree, Udeshi embarked on a career as a banker at a prestigious financial institution in the City and in Frankfurt. However, after a car crash, Udeshi decided to re-evaluate his path and decided to complete a masters degree in philosophy. While working in the city, he was looking for the clothes that would make up his ideal wardrobe. Unable to find them, he had all his clothes made to his designs and specification. Still unhappy with the results, Udeshi left the finance industry, choosing to study Design and Fashion at Central Saint Martin's and Parsons School of Design, where he trained under one of the last remaining bespoke shirtmakers of Jermyn Street.  Udeshi  Oscar Udeshi created his brand \\"Udeshi\\" in 1999 and was invited as a rising star to Pitti Uomo in Florence and CPD in D√ºsseldorf, and as guest designer of SEHM in Paris. He was one of the youngest menswear designers to show his creations on the catwalks of Paris showing at the British Ambassadors Residence in Paris, the same venue in which other fashion icons such as Vivienne Westwood and Sir Paul Smith first started showing. He was the only menswear designer to have his creations shown at the ‚Äúon the cuff‚Äù exhibition, on the history of cufflinks at Goldsmith's Hall in London. Udeshi's career has seen him design items for the Austrian Army, create a raincoat for a ceremony honouring the 100th anniversary of the Entente Cordiale between France and England, design the Chester Barrie White label collection 2004 and collaborate with Lavenham Quilted Jackets. To date, there are two Udeshi stores; the first was opened on Davies St in Mayfair, London in 2006 and was followed in 2008 by a second store at Via Monte di Pieta in Milan, Italy. There are plans to open a further twenty stores worldwide and also to expand into e-commerce through the brand's website. Udeshi garments range from sharp grey suits to colourful paisley jackets made of vintage cloth originally created for scarves and his accessories include purple suede loafers and stingray wallets, but each item has a distinct commonality; namely that nothing is created purely out of aesthetic considerations; there has to be some further value to a design feature. Both Udeshi's stores cater for bespoke and ready to wear apparel and collections are supported with seasonal lines of accessories and footwear. Udeshi is an active member of the British menswear industry and was elected youngest chairman of the British Menswear Guild in 2008. He became a board member of the UK Textile and Fashion Association in 2009. He also writes regular columns for the two industry magazines Drapers and Menswear Buyer.

The W.1 was built under contract by British Thomson-Houston (BTH) in the early 1940s. It is notable for being the first British jet engine to fly, as the \\"Whittle Supercharger Type W1\\",http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1955/1955%20-%200728.html powering the Gloster E.28/39 on its maiden flight at RAF Cranwell on 15 May 1941.Gunston 1989, p. 112. The W.1 was superseded by the Power Jets W.2. Design and development After a period of indifference, in June 1939 a demonstration of the Power Jets WU was made before a delegation of the Air Ministry, notably Dr Pye, Director of Scientific Research. The demonstration was so successful that the Ministry quickly arranged to buy the engine to give Power Jets working capital, lending it back to them for testing. E.28/39 prototype W4041/G powered by the W.1A At the same time, a contract was placed for a \\"flight engine\\", the W.1. Unlike the Whittle WU, that began bench testing in 1937, the W.1 was a symmetrical engine designed to facilitate, after development, installation in an aircraft. The W.1 used a double-sided centrifugal compressor of Hiduminium RR.59 alloy,imeche.org reverse-flow 'Lubbock' combustion chambers and a water-cooled axial-flow turbine section using 72 blades with 'fir-tree' root fixings; the turbine was later modified to use air-cooling. The turbine blades were of Firth-Vickers Rex 78, a stainless steel developed under Dr. W. H Hatfield. Design rating was at 16,500 rpm, increased to 17,750 rpm above 4,000 feet. With the W.1 aircraft manoeuvring would subsequently be limited by a compressor casing stress to 2g. Maximum jetpipe temperature was 597¬∞C. As development of the new design dragged on, it was decided to build a test unit \\"early engine\\" using any components that were deemed unairworthy along with test items. This was assembled to become the one-off W.1X. This officially unairworthy unit powered the Gloster E.28/39 on a short 'hop' during taxiing trials in April 1941, with flight trials taking place a month later with a definitive W.1 engine, the W.1A.Smith 1946, p. 87. After a visit to England in 1941, General Henry H. Arnold arranged for the W.1X to be flown to the U.S in October 1941, along with drawings for the more powerful W.2B engine, together with a team from Power Jets. The former became the prototype of first the General Electric I-A and then the General Electric I-16, and by April 1943 the latter had been developed to produce 1,650 pounds thrust (750 kgf).Smith 1946, p. 109. In 1941, experiments with boosting the W.1's thrust by introducing a liquid coolant were initiated, the first fluid tried being liquid ammonia which proved too effective, resulting in the engine overspeeding and pushing the thrust and rpm indicators off the scales, before later trials changed to using water, and water-methanol. A system to trial the technique in the E.28/39 was devised but never fitted.https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1947/1947%20-%201359.html Variants ;W.1(T) :Built from spares for bench-development only.https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1945/1945%20-%202022.html ;W.1(3) :Modified W.1. ;W.1X :Early W.1 built from non-airworthy parts and intended for ground use only (aircraft taxi tests).

United Kingdom was a case decided by the European Commission on Human Rights in 1994. Background In 1973, ISKCON acquired a manor for religious and residential use, which didn't raise objections at the time. In 1983, it entered into an agreement with the local authority, providing that ISKCON wouldn't permit more than 1,000 persons to visit the manor on any one day except with the council's consent. In 1987, the local authority served an enforcement notice to ISKCON claiming the latter has not fulfilled the agreement, and besides made a breach of planning control by changing the use of the land, requiring to change the use of the land. ISKCON considered it didn't breach planning control and was being deprived of its rights under the 1983 agreement by the notice. The notice was confirmed after ISKCON's appeal by the Secretary of State in 1990 and by the courts in 1991 and 1992. Decision The Commission found the complaint to be inadmissible, by a majority. It acknowledged an interference with the Article 9 (freedom of religion) rights to happen, but, unlike applicants, considered it was necessary in a democratic society to protect the rights of residents of the nearby village and public order. Important conclusions included that the Commission does not consider that Article 9 (Art. 9) of the Convention can be used to circumvent existing planning legislation, provided that in the proceedings under that legislation, adequate weight is given to freedom of religion and statements in letters sent by Ministers and an official [..] to the effect that the decision on ISKCON's appeal against the enforcement notice was based on the relevant land-use planning grounds and that \\"the religious aspects of the Society's activities at Bhaktivedanta Manor were not relevant\\". The Commission does not interpret these statements as suggesting that the religious importance of the Manor to the members of ISKCON was not fully taken into account and weighed against the general planning considerations, but rather as making clear that the refusal of planning permisison was based on proper planning grounds and not on any objections to the religious aspects of the activities of ISKCON.

Background and personal life Balfour purchased Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour in 1891. Following the introduction of electric lighting, the castle was gutted by fire in 1896. It was later rebuilt - with modern fire hydrants - and in 1901 Balfour put the island up for sale. Military career Balfour was commissioned in the 1st Dragoons, where he was appointed a lieutenant on 6 May 1885, and promoted captain on 1 August 1892. He was placed on the reserve list, and volunteered for service with the Imperial Yeomanry following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in late 1899. He was appointed second in command of the 11th battalion Imperial Yeomanry, with the temporary rank of major in the Army, on 10 February 1900, and left Liverpool for South Africa on the SS Cymric in March 1900. He was later promoted to lieutenant-colonel. Political career Balfour and Thomas Brassey, 2nd Earl Brassey, then plain Thomas Allnut Brassey, stood for election as the Member of Parliament for Christchurch in the October 1900 general election. At first Brassey seemed to have won by a slim majority of just 3 votes, but there were 11 spoiled votes which had not been marked properly by the presiding officers, 8 of them for Brassey and only 3 for Balfour, which reversed the result. Brassey alleged that there were electoral irregularities, although he stopped short of claiming corruption by Balfour, he did say that there were instances of impersonation and of voting by aliens. He lodged a court petition to overturn the result, but eventually withdrew the allegations.Bournemouth Echo 5 February 1901 The constituency of Christchurch at this time included the Borough of Bournemouth, which in 1901 expanded to include the parish of Winton, Dorset and Moordown. To avoid duplication of road names, some of the roads in the added parish had to be changed, and in commemoration of the resolution of the electoral dispute, an unnamed lane marking the boundary between Winton and Moordown became Balfour Road, and the adjoining Church Road became Brassey Road.Kelly‚Äôs Directory for Bournemouth, 1903 Balfour remained MP for Christchurch until 1906.

History CIFTA as a program was approved during the First Plenary Session of the OAS held on November 13, 1997. Its purpose was to establish a regional standard for the control of the illicit manufacturing and trafficking in firearms: the Inter-American Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Materiales. CIFTA emphasizes the need for authorizations or licenses of export, imports and transit; the reinforcement of the checkpoints for exports, amongst other things. The Convention thus seeks to promote and facilitate the cooperation and exchange of information and experiences between OAS Member States. The Convention established a Consultative Committee gathering a representative for each State Party in order to guarantee its implementation, to promote the exchange of information, to facilitate cooperation and foster training between States.http://www.oas.org/dsp/espanol/cpo_cifta_armas.asp The treaty entered into force in 1998.Ratifications. Membership As of 2013, the treaty has been ratified by 31 of the 34 states in the OAS. The states that have not ratified the treaty are Canada, Jamaica, and the United States. Each of the three non-ratifying states are signatories to it. United States U.S. President Barack Obama has proposed that the U.S. Senate ratify CIFTA. Opponents are concerned that the measures contained within CIFTA could criminalize activities such as reloading ammunition if they are done without a license. Other provisions make unlicensed modification to any weapon a serious crime. Furthermore, there are provisions that expand infractions to larger groups of people effectively holding an organization responsible for the actions of a single member.

Life He was born in London and took his B.A. degree at Magdalen College, Oxford, on 15 July 1528. In 1529 he became a fellow of his college, M.A. on 6 June 1532, B.D. on 17 June 1539. On 26 March 1565 he supplicated the university for a D.D. degree, but was not admitted. He was a Protestant, but remained in post in the reign of Queen Mary. In 1555, on the presentation of Ralph Henslow, he was appointed prebendary of Lyme and Halstock, Sarum. He was also a canon of Chichester, and in 1561 a dispensation was granted him on account of this as regarded part of his term of residence at Salisbury. He subscribed the articles as a member of the lower house of the convocation of 1563, and when the reformist \\"six articles\\" of the same year were debated there, in common with other exiles, he signed them, but was outvoted by a majority of one. He also subscribed the articles of 1571. Bradbridge was collated to be chancellor of Chichester on 28 April 1562, and was allowed to hold the chancellorship in commendam with his bishopric. On Low Sunday 1563 he gave the annual Spittal sermon, and on 23 June of the same year, allowing himself conformable to the discipline which was then being established, was elected dean of Salisbury by letters from Queen Elizabeth, in the place of the Italian Peter Vannes. Here he was a contemporary of John Foxe and Thomas Harding. From 1568 to 1576 he was the prebendary of Horningsham at Heytesbury, Wiltshire. On 26 February 1571 the queen issued her significavit in his favour to the archbishop, and he was duly elected bishop of Exeter on 1 March. After a declaration of the queen's supremacy and doing homage, the temporalities of the see were restored to him on the 14th. His election was confirmed the next day, and he was consecrated at Lambeth on the 18th by Archbishop Matthew Parker and Bishops Robert Horne and Nicholas Bullingham. More of a scholar than an administrator, he was given the Pentateuch to translate in 1572 for the new edition of the Bishop's Bible, according to John Strype. He had trouble with Catholics and dissenters, and sent three Cornishmen who refused to attend church to the London authorities. His commissary Dr. Tremayn headed a party against him, but the bishop withstood him, and had Lord Burghley block a proposed commission in the diocese. He also asked Cecil in 1578 if he could return to Salisbury. He resided mostly at Newton Ferrers, Devon, and died suddenly there alone, at noon on 27 June 1578, aged 77. He was indebted to the queen in the amount of ¬£1,400 for tenths and subsidies received in her behalf from the clergy, so that immediately after his death she seized all his goods. He was buried in Exeter Cathedral, on the north side of the choir near the altar, under a plain altar tomb.

History  Before the construction of the current church, a chapel dedicated to Mary and Saint Nicholas (patron saint of fishermen) stood on this site. The chapel was situated close to the river Aa, where bargees cast off vessels in the western harbour (Westerhaven). The chapel became a parish church in the year 1247 and was named \\"Chapel of Our Lady at the river Aa\\" (Onze-Lieve-Vrouwe ter Aa-kerk). At this time, Groningen consisted of two centres, each surrounding a religious edifice, the Church of Our Lady at the river Aa being one of them. Fishermen and tradesmen inhabited the area around this chapel. The chapel was transformed into a brick gothic church between 1425 and 1495. Both the interior and exterior have been altered many times over the course of history due to the iconoclasm during the Reformation, war damage (Siege of Groningen) and natural phenomena (lightning strike). Today it is used as a venue for concerts, theatre, exhibitions, parties and meetings. Church services are no longer held. Towers Images of the Siege of Groningen in 1672 show the Aa-kerk without the top of the tower. After the war a new wooden tower top was built. On 23 April 1710, the tower spontaneously collapsed killing two people. In 1711, a new tower was built. The current tower contains three bells with the notes of F#, D# and B, which are rung automatically. They were all cast by Crans of Enckhuysen in 1714. Organs In 1667, an organ was built by Van Hagerbeer. It was destroyed by fire in 1671.www.aakerk.nl (dutch) The first Schnitger organ in the church was built by Arp Schnitger in 1697 (see gallery for a sketch). In 1710, the tower of the church collapsed and the organ was destroyed. The second Schnitger was built in 1702, originally for the Broerkerk in Groningen. In 1815, the organ was transferred to the Aa-kerk. The Bolsward organ build by Raphael Rodensteen in 1550 was originally for the Martinikerk in Bolsward. In 1635, the organ was transferred to the Broerkerk in Groningen and in 1877 it was transferred back to the Martinikerk in Bolsward. In 1991, it was transferred again to Groningen and the Aa-kerk.

History Beginnings The club was founded in 1915 in a German immigrant community in Mexico City. The founders were Edvard Giffenig, Germ√°n Stuht, Richard Obert, Walter Mues, and Carl Mues. In their first years the club mostly finished last or close to the bottom of the standings. In 1920, the Mexican federation split the tournament into two leagues: the national and the Mexican leagues. Germania played in the Mexican league along with Asturias F.C., M√©xico FC, Morelos and Deportivo Internacional, Am√©rica, Espa√±a, L¬¥Amicale Francaise, Reforma, and Luz y Fuerza. In the same year, Germania won its only league title, though it was not officially recognised because of the political situation at the time. 1922‚Äì1923 Germania reinforced the club by signing Kurt Friederich, who had played in FC Z√ºrich. On 6 May 1923, in a title match between Germania and Asturias F.C., Friedrich lead Germania to a one-point lead in the first half. In the second half, however, with the clubs tied at 1‚Äì1, Octavio Rimada managed to score for Asturias, giving the club a 2‚Äì1 lead which they held to the end of the match to once again proclaim themselves champions. In that tournament Kurt Friederich won the title for scoring, with 12 goals in 13 games.

The band was primarily based in Nashville, TN until breaking up in 2012. Parachute Musical is composed of Josh Foster (vocals, piano), Tom Gilbert (guitar, backing vocals), Andrew Samples (bass, backing vocals) and Ben Jacoby (drums). Early Days Foster and Gilbert grew up in Olney, MD and met in the 6th grade. During their high school years, the two played together in the school jazz band. Gilbert and Jacoby (a Silver Spring, MD native) met while working at Chuck Levin's Washington Music Center in Wheaton, MD. Jacoby grew up touring with The American Originals Fife and Drum Corps. The three formed Parachute Musical in 2005 along with bassist Matt Dowling (now of the Washington, D.C. based Deleted Scenes). The band played their earliest shows at Washington, D.C. venues The Grog & Tankard, The Velvet Lounge and Black Cat. Parachute Musical and relocation to Nashville, TN (2005 - 2007) The band's first release, Parachute Musical, was recorded in 2005 as an American University student's recording project. After its release, Jacoby and Gilbert left the band and moved from DC; Jacoby to Milwaukee, WI, and Gilbert to Murfreesboro, TN to attend Middle Tennessee State University. Foster struggled to maintain the band with various line up changes while he completed his jazz guitar performance degree at American University, resulting in the band's temporary breakup. Inspired by a Jamie Cullum concert at the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C., Foster relocated to Nashville, TN in February 2007 to regroup the band with Gilbert. Jacoby soon followed. Once in Nashville, the band enlisted Gilbert's friend Kyle Cornett as bass player. Parachute Musical immediately began performing in Nashville and touring regionally in the Southeast and Northeast. Everything Is Working Out Fine In Some Town LP (2008 - 2009) On June 19, 2008 Parachute Musical released a 10-track album entitled Everything Is Working Out Fine In Some Town, produced and engineered by Nashville-based indie producer Derek Garten. The conceptualization and recording process for the album was over a year in length. The album features layered orchestral segments scored by Foster. Lyrically, the album deals with the collapse of Foster's engagement and struggles with his family. A repeating note theme appears three times throughout the album; in the opening title track, during \\"Flashback \`83\\", and after the last track, \\"Stranger Things\\". The album was heralded as \\"one of the most elaborate and expansive pieces the local independent rock scene has produced in recent memory\\" by local Nashville paper, All The Rage' http://nashville.metromix.com/music/article/a-long- strange-trip/496993/content'. The track \\"One More Song\\" was used on the E! Entertainment Television show Kourtney & Khloe Take Miami (Season 2, Episode 9) on Sunday, August 9, 2010. The track \\"Instead\\" was used on MTV's The Real World (Season 24, Episode 11) on Wednesday, September 8, 2010. Everything Is Working Out Fine In Some Town was released in Japan on This Time Records on August 18, 2010. The Japanese release contains the No Comfort single and \\"Little Did You Know\\" as bonus tracks. Parachute Musical toured throughout 2008 and 2009 in support of Everything Is Working Out Fine In Some Town, co- headlining tours with Modern Skirts, Heypenny, All Get Out, The Winter Sounds, Keegan DeWitt and Wakey!Wakey!. Kyle Cornett left the band in May 2009, and was replaced by bass player and Tennessee native Andrew Samples (Feable Weiner, Mondo Primo). Touring & No Comfort Single (2010) Parachute Musical released a two-song single on January 8, 2010, entitled No Comfort and began another tour with Sequoyah Prep School. For No Comfort, Parachute Musical collaborated again with producer Derek Garten. A music video was released for the track \\"Drop Me A Line\\" on March 30, 2010. In April and May 2010, Parachute Musical embarked on West Side Toury, a five-week tour of the West Coast with Athens, GA based The Winter Sounds. On August 3, 2010 the band released a track called Little Did You Know, featuring pedal steel guitar player Russ Pahl (Elton John, Willie Nelson). Parachute Musical changed up instruments to record the song, with Samples on keys, Gilbert on Bass, Foster on guitar and Jacoby on drums. The track was released for free via the band's website. Kill It Cut It Down (2010 - 2011) Parachute Musical announced on August 5, 2010 that they would be taking some time off the road to prepare a third full- length record. Utilizing the website Kickstarter, the band began a fundraiser in September 2010 in an effort to raise the funds necessary to record their next album. By the end of the campaign on November 9, 2010, Parachute Musical fans had raised a total of $16,705. In a press release on December 22, 2010, the band announced they would be working with producer Jim Wirt (Incubus, Fiona Apple, The Rocket Summer, Jack's Mannequin) on a new full-length record. The band recorded in Cleveland, OH over January, 2011 which they've since described as \\"the coldest month of [their] lives.\\" In a December 2010 article on Sinizine.net, Foster said ‚Äú[People] should expect a new, more mature group of songs ... [It will remain] emotive, still fun, but more rockin‚Äô.‚Äù Parachute Musical released a two-song single called New Love on Valentines Day, 2011. The single contains the tracks \\"New Love\\" (featuring the horn section from the Richmond, VA-based Murphy's Kids) and \\"380427\\". These songs had been recorded in August 2010. On May 9, 2011, Parachute Musical announced the title of their new full-length record, Kill It Cut It Down. On August 23, 2011, the band released Kill It Cut It Down on their website for $2, which increased by $1 a day until reaching $10. According to the band's website, the phrase Kill It Cut It Down means \\"the abandonment of old ways; leaving behind the safe and familiar to embrace something new.\\" Blogger JrzyGyrl.com called the record \\"a logical and welcome progression from 2008‚Ä≤s Everything Is Working Out Fine In Some Town.\\" Musically, the band has \\"[left] behind the piano heavy ballad tracks that made up most of their first album, and replaced them with more guitars\\" creating their own version of \\"aggressive-but-bright pop-rock.\\" Parachute Musical set out on tour in support of Kill It Cut It Down in the Fall of 2011, co-headlining with Elsinore and fellow Nashvillian Kyle Andrews. Break Up On March 5, 2012, Parachute Musical announced on their blog that they would be ending the band. In an excerpt from the post, \\"The past 7+ years have been some of the greatest moments of our lives, but at the same time, we all feel that this chapter has come to a close. We‚Äôre ready to try new things, go new places, see where life takes us.\\" The breakup was on friendly terms, as the band stated \\"we're brothers and will continue to be.\\" Parachute Musical played their last show on Friday, March 30, 2012 at The 5 Spot in Nashville, TN.

IKF's History Located in Miami, Florida, the International Kids Fund was founded in response to an increasing number of desperate families from Latin America and the Caribbean who regularly showed up at Jackson Memorial Foundation seeking financial support for their sick children's medical treatment at Holtz Children's Hospital, which is prohibited by law to use publicly funded resources to care for non-residents of Miami-Dade County. At first, Jackson Memorial Foundation assisted these families in identifying funds. But as the number of families increased, the foundation came to realize that a special organizational and financial infrastructure was needed to appropriately support these families. By 2001, 6-year-old Jean Gabriel Senior had just arrived to Holtz Children's Hospital to battle leukemia. Jean Gabriel was in pain and critically ill. His family had exhausted all medical possibilities in their home country, the Dominican Republic, and could not afford to pay for Jean Gabriel's medical care in the United States. Rather than ignoring his plight and permitting him to suffer, the hospital's administrators, physicians and benefactors united with Jackson Memorial Foundation to establish IKF, not only to help Jean Gabriel, but all foreign children who arrive at Holtz seeking medical treatments that are not available in their home countries and that their desperate families cannot afford. On January 9, 2002, just days before his final treatment, Jean Gabriel unexpectedly died. IKF continues to dedicate its ongoing efforts to his memory by helping countless numbers of critically ill children for whom expert medical treatment is not available in their country of origin. IKF's Children International Kids Fund has helped hundreds of children who could not find appropriate treatment in their home countries. Two of its most popular cases have involved young teenage girls with extremely large facial tumors. In April 2008, IKF launched a fundraising campaign to help Lai Thi Dao, a young girl from Vietnam, who suffered from an extremely large, benign Schwannoma tumor on the right side of her face. Although common, the size of Lai's tumor was extremely rare. It had been growing since she was about three years old, and had begun to grow faster than the rest of her organs due to her high metabolism. Lai needed surgery to remove the tumor, which had severely deformed her face and was impairing her ability to breathe. After her surgery and recovery, Lai was featured on the national daytime talk show called The Doctors. Lai's story was told all over the world and was covered by all national and international media outlets. In 2009, International Kids Fund welcomed back a young Haitian teenager, Marlie Casseus, who needed follow-up surgery after doctors removed a 16-pound growth from her face. Marlie suffered from polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, a genetic condition in which the bone structure is replaced by connective tissue.Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia definition - Medical Dictionary definitions of popular medical terms easily defined on MedTerms. MedicineNet.com. Retrieved 11 June 2009. Marlie first became a patient of IKF in 2005 when her parents heard about a previous medical case in which IKF helped save a girl with a facial tumor. She has had several surgeries since then to help reconstruct her face with titanium and polyethylene implants. Marlie's story also garnered international media attention. Marlie's journey was first documented on the Discovery Channel and has also been featured as an hour-long documentary on Discovery en Espa√±ol's \\"Extraordinary Stories. A follow-up to the original Discovery Channel documentary aired in September on TLC.http://health.discovery.com/videos/discovery-health-viewers-choice-reel- marlies-new-face.html IKF's Mission International Kids Fund seeks to provide life-saving medical care to needy children from Latin America and the Caribbean who suffer from life-threatening illnesses. The Fund will ensure these children receive the best care possible at the Holtz Children's Hospital in the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Medical Center. This unprecedented cause, a unique vehicle for philanthropic outreach to the Caribbean and Latin America, will be fueled by the generous support of individuals and organizations from the international community who want to help these children stay alive. Eligibility Although IKF would like to help all children, not every child is eligible for treatment and/or sponsorship by IKF. Eligibility for sponsorship is determined by the following criteria: *The child must be fighting a medical condition that cannot be treated in his or her home country. *His or her family lacks health insurance and the financial resources to pay for the required health care treatment. *He or she is not a U.S. citizen or resident, as U.S. citizens or residents qualify for government aid. *Doctors believe he or she has a good chance of getting cured. *His or her medical condition will not require lifelong medical care. *Transplant cases are only eligible if a sponsor has already committed to providing financial support. About Holtz Children's Hospital Named for a landmark gift by Fana and Abel Holtz, Holtz Children's Hospital at University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Medical Center is one of the largest and most respected children's hospitals in the nation ‚Äì a hospital that treats more children than any other hospital in Florida. While Holtz Children's Hospital provides expert diagnosis and treatment on site for virtually every condition, illness, and injury threatening children today, the hospital's location on the UM/Jackson campus means that patients also enjoy immediate access to world-class physicians skilled in medical issues facing people of all ages. Holtz's Pediatric Transplant Center, one of the largest in the entire nation, is the only center in Florida capable of performing every type of transplant, and is one of three centers in the country specializing in pediatric multiple-organ transplants. The hospital is the largest birthing center in the state, and its Neonatal Intensive Care Unit is among the largest and most respected in the country. Through a partnership with University of Miami and nearly $20 million in annual research and training funding, Holtz Children's Hospital is one of the top pediatric clinical research centers in the United States and the largest in Florida. As a part of a public hospital dedicated to serving every person in need, Holtz is also South Florida's number one source of medical care for children without financial resources. Through International Kids Fund, it provides vital medical care to needy children from all over the world who suffer from serious illnesses and cannot get such care in their own countries.

Most were rifles, but some were pistols and shotguns. The law was amended in 1999 to restrict acquisition and transfer of magazines that could hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Firearms and magazines that were legally owned at the time the law was passed were grandfathered if they were registered with the California Department of Justice. Proponents The co-author of the legislation, California State Senate President pro tem David Roberti, found himself the subject of a recall attempt by the gun lobby in 1994. He survived that, but later that year lost a Democratic primary election for the office of California State Treasurer. The loss was considered a result of the immense campaign finance costs of defending against the recall, and the draining of those finances.Two for the Money, LA Weekly, Howard Blume, September 12, 2001. Retrieved November 5, 2018. Assembly Speaker pro tem, Mike Roos who retired in 1991, was the other co-author. California penal code categories The Colt AR-15 Sporter SP1 Carbine is a semi-automatic rifle that is classified as an assault weapon under California law. There are three categories of assault weapons under California law: *Category I are those firearms specified on the original Roberti-Roos assault weapons list. They are identified by make and model in Penal Code ¬ß30510. *Category II are those firearms specified in the AK and AR-15 series weapons list. They are also listed in Penal Code ¬ß30510. *Category III are firearms defined as such based on specific generic characteristics, also referred to as \\"SB 23 assault weapons.\\" They are defined in Penal Code ¬ß12276.1 and ¬ß30515. The 'Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989, was augmented in 1999. It has also inspired follow-on legislation such as .50 Caliber BMG Regulation Act of 2004 and further restrictions on semi-automatic firearms.

Related court cases Kasler v. Lockyer The California Supreme Court handed down its decision in Kasler v. Lockyer in August 2000. The original suit, in the mid-1990s, challenged the constitutionality of California's 1989 Roberti-Roos assault weapons ban. The Court found in favor of the defendants, Attorney General Bill Lockyer and the State of California; one resulting aspect of this decision was that the AWCA '89 \\"series\\" terminology used for AR and AK type weapons applied to all similar weapons, regardless of nomenclature (manufacturer, model number, version, variant, etc.). Harrott v. Kings County In June 2001, the California Supreme Court handed down its decision in Harrott v. County of Kings (25 P.3d 649 (Cal. 2001) that contravened portions of the Kasler decision. This determined the following: a) Determination of \\"series\\" inclusion (series member) is difficult enough that owners and law enforcement should merely have to consult a list of specific makes and models (in California Code of Regulation) to know if their gun is a prohibited firearm. b) Trial courts cannot determine if a given firearm/receiver is of the AR or AK \\"series\\". Prohibited weapons in AR/AK \\"series\\" must be specifically identified by make and model and the Department of Justice (DOJ) must promulgate this list. c) DOJ has authority to 'identify' and promulgate new members of the AR & AK \\"series\\" itself. This authority is limited to AR and AK series firearms/receivers. d) DOJ cannot prohibit other firearms outside the AR/AK series and must begin an \\"add-on\\" procedure filed in certain superior courts, as specified in Penal Code 30520. The DOJ can first seek a temporary declaration that given firearms are assault weapon before categorizing it permanently. e) DOJ determinations of AR/AK \\"series\\" membership are subject to challenge and verification. Rifles Fixed- magazine rifle This style of rifle is made by combining an AR-15 upper receiver with an AR-15 lower receiver which has not been banned by specific name, and which has a fixed, non-detachable 10-round (maximum, anything above 10 is a felony) magazine. In such a configuration, otherwise prohibited features such as a telescoping stock, pistol grip, and flash hider may be present. While formerly prohibited under the now-expired federal assault weapon ban of 1994‚Äì2004, the presence of a bayonet lug is not prohibited by California state law and can be present on firearms without violation. However, the magazine cannot be detachable, so to load the rifle the shooter must \\"top load\\". To top-load, the shooter pulls the rear takedown pin, hinges the upper receiver on the front pivot pin, and loads the now exposed magazine. Alternatively, several \\"magazine lock\\" devices are available which replace the magazine release button with an inset pin that requires the use of a special tool to release the magazine, thereby, disallowing a readily \\"detachable magazine\\", to be compliant with California state firearms law. Featureless rifle If a rifle has none of the prohibited features (pistol grip, telescoping or folding stock, flash hider, grenade/flare launcher, forward pistol grip), There are several products available on the market to configure featureless rifles. The California DOJ Bureau of Firearms has attested under oath that the U-15 stock, the Hammerhead Grip and the MonsterMan Grip do not constitute a pistol grip and are therefore legal when used on a detachable magazine semiautomatic centerfire rifle with none of the features listed in CA PC 30515(a)(1)(A-F).Sworn testimony of Frank Navarro, California DOJ Bureau of Firearms Special Agent, in the case of People vs. Haack and Haack, California County of Tulare Superior Court, November 3, 2010. Off-list lower receivers Most AR-15 manufacturers now make lower receivers which qualify as \\"Off-List\\" Lower (OLL) receivers which are legal to possess and use in the state of California. With regard to standard capacity magazine devices, after January 1, 2000, it is illegal to offer for sale, import, manufacture, give, or lend (although it is legal to possess and use) any detachable box magazine with a capacity exceeding 10 cartridges.California Penal Code ¬ß 32310. Individuals possessing such magazines at a lawful location such as a gun range may only allow use of their lawfully owned standard-capacity magazines by another if they are in the immediate vicinity of the person using such items.

History Givat Herzl was one of a number of rapidly expanding Jewish neighborhoods in the Jaffa municipality of Mandate Palestine that formed as satellites of Tel Aviv. After the 1936 Arab revolt, the residents of Givat Herzl demanded that they be annexed to the Tel Aviv municipality, stating that they were \\"like a foreign body in the Jaffa Municipality,\\" and that geographically, ethnically, and organically,\\" they were a natural continuation of Tel Aviv.

It is DeLillo's fifteenth novel published under his own name and his first published work of fiction since his 2007 novel Falling Man.  Plot  According to the Scribner 2010 catalog made available on October 12, 2009, Point Omega concerns the following: In the middle of a desert \\"somewhere south of nowhere,\\" to a forlorn house made of metal and clapboard, a secret war advisor has gone in search of space and time. Richard Elster, seventy-three, was a scholar - an outsider - when he was called to a meeting with government war planners. This was prompted by an article he wrote explicating and parsing the word \\"rendition\\". They asked Elster to conceptualize their efforts - to form an intellectual framework for their troop deployments, counterinsurgency, orders for rendition. For two years he read their classified documents and attended secret meetings. He was to map the reality these men were trying to create \\"Bulk and swagger,\\" he called it. He was to conceptualize the war as a haiku. \\"I wanted a war in three lines...\\" At the end of his service, Elster retreats to the desert, where he is joined by a filmmaker intent on documenting his experience. Jim Finley wants to make a one-take film, Elster its single character - \\"Just a man against a wall.\\" The two men sit on the deck, drinking and talking. Finley makes the case for his film. Weeks go by. And then Elster's daughter Jessie visits - an \\"otherworldly\\" woman from New York - who dramatically alters the dynamic of the story. Jessie is strange and detached but Elster adores her. Elster explains how she is of high intelligence and remarks that she can determine what people are saying in advance of hearing the words by reading lips. Jim is sexually drawn to her but nothing happens except his watching her as a voyeur would. After the most pointed of such behavior Jessie disappears without a trace. Line two of the haiku structure (see below) winds up with the disbelief and grieving over Jessie; there are attempts to find her; there are references to a boyfriend or acquaintance named (maybe) Dennis. Jessie's mother had sent her to the desert to get away from this man. In light of this devastating event, all the men's talk, the accumulated meaning of conversation and connection, is thrown into question. What is left is loss, fierce and incomprehensible. The novel is structured like a haiku to provide the illusion of self-contained meaning. Lines one and three take place on September 3 and then September 4. The viewpoint is that of an anonymous man watching a work of conceptual art (24 Hour Psycho) that involves Psycho slowed down, broken down so that it takes 24 hours to play. The man mostly stands against a wall in the exhibition room and obsesses about the details and concepts of the work in hopes of willfully losing himself in Psycho (a kind of self-rendition). He attends the exhibition every day, all day. In Line one, Elster and Jim make a brief appearance. The man assumes they are academics, film critics and doesn't understand why they leave so quickly. In Line two, we meet Jim and Elster and the main \\"action\\" of the novel takes place (temporally after Lines one and three). Jim is a filmmaker obsessed with the medium. His one previous work was, as his estranged wife remarked, a film about an idea. It seems to involve a pastiche of Jerry Lewis in performance mode at his famous telethons. Only Jerry Lewis appears in the film; only Elster will appear in the film Jim proposes to him. Elster refuses to agree to the idea but strings Jim along out in the desert where he does reveal a little about his intellectual provenance including his study of Teilhard de Chardin (whose principal idea is of a universe moving toward greater complexity and consciousnessTeilhard de Chardin who wrote in French, introduced the concept \\"le point om√©ga\\"; as there is no possibility to change the word order in translation the novel appeared as Point Om√©ga (translated by Marianne Veron, Actes Sud). Both omega point and point omega are possible in English, so the weight of the reference is discutable.). In Line three, Jessie goes to the Psycho exhibit and meets the man on the wall. She tells him her father recommended the exhibit. We already know that Jim recommended it to Elster and took him to the exhibit. The man on the wall tries to arrange a date with Jessie. He gets her phone number but not her name. Line three ends with the man returning to the exhibit. The direction of the novel is the opposite of movement toward greater complexity and consciousness. It is toward a self- contained, self-defining and blind will to power. That is the idea behind the government's notion of war as haiku. Elster's parsing of the word \\"rendition\\" is no different from Psycho in slo-mo: murder disassociated from its reality by clinical and abstract analysis. The novel's central metaphor is autism. The man on the wall (in either manifestation) and Jessie are obviously symptomatic. Jim and Elster are no better. The signs are there: Jerry Lewis, Psycho in slo-mo, war as haiku, the desert with Elster's solace in it as signifier for total annihilation, the word \\"rendition\\". There are clear parallels to Thomas Pynchon, especially Gravity's Rainbow. In Pynchon the tension balances along the relationship between knowledge (greater complexity?) and a death instinct; capitalism or western civilization as a death cult. In Point Omega the movement toward annihilation (rendition) is symptomatic of a defect or disturbance in mental process. In his review for Publishers Weekly, Dan Fesperman revealed that the Finley character is \\"a middle-aged filmmaker who, in the words of his estranged wife, is too serious about art but not serious enough about life\\" and compares Elster to \\"a sort of Bush-era Dr. Strangelove without the accent or the comic props\\". Writing for the Wall Street Journal, Alexandra Altar described the novel as \\"a meditation on time, extinction, aging and death, subjects that Mr. DeLillo seldom explored in much depth as a younger writer.\\"  Promotion and publicity  DeLillo made a series of rare public appearances in the run up to the release of Point Omega throughout September, October, and November 2009, and was set to do more press publicity upon the novel's release. One of these appearances was a PEN event in New York, 'Reckoning with Torture: Memos and Testimonies from the \\"War on Terror\\"'. This event was \\"an evening of readings and response, [with] Members and friends of PEN read[ing] from the recently- released secret documents that have brought these abuses to light - memos, declassified communications, and testimonies by detainees - and will reflect on how [America] can move forward as a nation.\\" An original short story unrelated to Point Omega entitled \\"Midnight in Dostoevsky\\" appeared in the November 30 edition of The New Yorker. An extract from Point Omega was made available on the Simon and Schuster website on December 10, 2009. DeLillo was set to give a first public reading of Point Omega at Book Court in Brooklyn, New York on February 11, 2010. DeLillo made an unexpected appearance at a PEN event on the steps of the main branch of the New York City Public Library in support of Chinese dissident writer Liu Xiaobo, who was sentenced to eleven years in prison for \\"inciting subversion of state power\\" on December 31, 2009. Point Omega spent one week on the New York Times Bestseller List, peaking at #35 on the extended version of the list during its one-week stay on the list.  Reception  On the whole, reviews for Point Omega have been positive.Point Omega Media Watch - a novel by Don DeLillo - 2010 An early mostly positive review appeared on the website of Publishers Weekly on December 21, 2009. Reviewer Dan Fesperman praised the novel's style, stating that while \\"it's hardly a new experience to emerge from a Don DeLillo novel feeling faintly disturbed and disoriented... DeLillo's lean prose is so spare and concentrated that the aftereffects are more powerful than usual\\". Fesperman goes on to add that DeLillo \\"is at his best rendering micro-moments of the inner life, and \\"laying bare the vanity of intellectual abstraction.\\" However, Fesperman writes that there are occasions when \\"the going gets a little tedious\\", and he compares the novel to a \\"brisk hike up a desert mountain ‚Äî a trifle arid, perhaps, but with occasional views of breathtaking grandeur.\\" Further praise came from the literary review Kirkus Reviews, with its reviewer declaring the novel to be \\"an icy, disturbing and masterfully composed study of guilt, loss and regret - quite possibly the author's finest yet.\\" The Kirkus review further praised the novel's narrative as \\"crisp, precisely understated, [and] hauntingly elliptical\\"; approvingly drawing comparisons between Point Omega and Albert Camus' novella The Fall; and that with this novel, DeLillo had moved \\"a step beyond the disturbing symbolism of Falling Man\\". As with the Publishers Weekly review, Leigh Anne Vrabel's review for Library Journal highlighted the quality of DeLillo's prose, stating that it is \\"simultaneously spare and lyrical, creating a minimalist dreamworld that will please readers attuned to language and sound.\\" Vrabel also praised the narrative of the novel, writing that \\"structural purists... will appreciate the novel's film- related framing device, which wraps around the main action like a blanket and unifies the whole with a painful, poignant grace.\\" The only slightly negative remark regards the novel's brevity, but the overall conclusion was highly positive: \\"though it be but brief, DeLillo's latest offering is fierce. An excellent nugget of thought-provoking fiction that pits life against art and emotion against intellect.\\" There were also negative notices from such publications as New York, The National and Esquire.Benjamin Alsup, \\"Somebody Please Get Don DeLillo a Drink\\", Vanity Fair, January 27, 2010 In his mostly negative review for New York magazine's books section, Sam Anderson struck a note of disappointment, puzzlement, and confusion. In Anderson's opinion, Point Omega is \\"[the latest of a] recent stretch of post-Underworld metaphysical anti-thrillers‚ÄîThe Body Artist, Cosmopolis, Falling Man‚Äî[showing DeLillo's writing] has reached a whole new level of [narrative] inertia\\". For Anderson, the novel's \\"glacial aesthetic\\" and seemingly slow moving non-plot of the novel is a major fault: \\"the closest the book comes to real action is when Elster's daughter shows up‚Äîalthough ‚Äúshows up‚Äù is a strong phrase to use for a character who hardly seems to exist at all. When she disappears, mysteriously ‚Äî the only major event of the novel ‚Äî it seems like a formality.\\" The experience of reading a \\"late-phase DeLillo\\" novel, according to Anderson, makes him \\"feel like a late-phase DeLillo character: distant, confused, catatonic, drifting into dream worlds, missing dentist appointments, forgetting the meanings of basic words, and staring at everyday objects as if they were holy relics.\\" However, Anderson admits that \\"this disorientation might explain why I can‚Äôt quite make up my mind about Point Omega\\", suggesting some positives and elaborating that \\"the strongest material in Point Omega is only tangentially related to the book‚Äôs main story, and is essentially just art criticism\\" (referring to the bracketing chapters that begin and end the book). Anderson further remarks on the novel's style: \\"DeLillo is, after Beckett and Robbe-Grillet, the indisputable master of grinding a plot to the brink of stasis and then recording its every last movement. Point Omega seems like a logical endpoint of that quest.\\" But Anderson goes on to ask with some concern, \\"how much further into the desert of plotlessness is DeLillo willing to go, and how far are we willing to follow? Where else can he possibly take the novel?\\" Anderson finally concludes on a negative note: \\"I get the sense that he wants his oeuvre to culminate in a pure act of attention, and I‚Äôm not convinced that the novel is the best medium in which to do that. As a raging DeLillo fan, I‚Äôd be more excited to see him branch out to another genre‚Äîan experimental autobiography, or essayistic micro-observations of his favorite art and literature‚Äîthan write another short novel about detached and largely interchangeable characters.\\" Writing for the \\"Friday Review\\" section of The National, Giles Harvey - like Anderson's review in New York - made much criticism of the stylistic tendencies of what could be termed as 'Late DeLillo', arguing that \\"since the epochal 1997 masterpiece Underworld... DeLillo's books have come to seem lopsided, top-heavy: dense with cerebration but humanly thin.\\" At his best, Harvey writes, \\"when [DeLillo] is... sending us dispatches from the front lines of contemporary experience... DeLillo has few obvious betters. By comparison, most of his peers seem 50 miles back, in the hermetic opulence of some requisitioned ch√¢teau.\\" However, in Point Omega, Harvey feels that DeLillo \\"fails to make his characters more than ciphers for his ideas.\\" Much of Harvey's criticism concerns the protagonists and characterisation. Of the retired war planner Elster, Harvey draws comparisons to Bill Gray in DeLillo's Mao II and Lee Harvey Oswald in Libra, but criticises DeLillo's characterisation for making Elster seem \\"less a human being than a vague aggregate of ideas.\\" Harvey goes on, \\"what‚Äôs missing from DeLillo‚Äôs presentation of human beings... is emotional depth.\\" Aside from the weak characterisation, the typical DeLillo black comedy appears to be watered down and a distilled re-reun of the humour from DeLillo's previous novels. The conversations that occur between Elster and his would-be documenter Jim Finley in the main body of the novel \\"can sometimes be quite funny (although not nearly as funny as the screwball conversations on similar themes in Players or White Noise)\\". Further, Harvey finds fault with how, as he argues, \\"Point Omega was presumably conceived of as an emotional education ‚Äì a story about a coldly intellectual man whose daughter‚Äôs disappearance leads him to recognise the limits of the intellect and his own human fallibility... It is indicative of DeLillo's failure that he should feel the need to state so baldly the novel's intended emotional arc.\\"  References   External links  * Schuster page for book, including excerpt Category:Novels by Don DeLillo Category:2010 American novels Category:Haiku ","title":"Point Omega"},{"id":"24677039","text":"Nigel Wingrove (born 26 October 1957) is the founder of the horror film company Salvation Films and the Redemption film label and creator of the online alternative female collective, the Satanic Sluts. He is also a film director and the only director to have had a film banned in the UK on the grounds of blasphemy. Redemption films Wingrove founded the film distribution company Redemption Films (now called Salvation Films) in 1992, which was the first UK company to specialise in releasing obscure European films by directors such as Jean Rollin, Jess Franco, Dario Argento and Peter Walker. Redemption's logo features a white, eyeless face, which is of Wingrove's former girlfriend, the actress and scream queen, Eileen Daly. Films Separate to his work as managing director of Salvation Films, Wingrove has written and directed a number of low-budget films including Sacred Flesh (2000), \\"Red Kiss\\" (2004), Sexcretares (2005), Purple Haze (2005) and three titles; The Black Order Cometh (2006), The Black Masses (2007), and Scandalised (2008), in the Satanic Sluts range. Wingrove's early film work included the short erotic film Visions of Ecstasy (1989), which is an interpretation of the writings of Carmelite nun Saint Teresa of Avila with a soundtrack by Steven Severin of Siouxsie and the Banshees and would go on to be banned from distribution on the grounds of blasphemy. Wingrove is currently working on a nunsploitation film, \\"Sisters of Armageddon\\", and an Alice in Wonderland inspired title: \\"Alice in the Underworld\\" and producing a series of cosplay themed films for Ghoul Girls, a sister film label to the Satanic Sluts. Anti-Censorship In 1996, Wingrove challenged the British Board of Film Classification, which had refused to grant a distribution certificate for his short film Visions of Ecstasy on the grounds that it was blasphemous, at the European Court of Human Rights. He claimed that the ban breached Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and was disproportionate. Wingrove's case was supported by the notable figures such as authors Salman Rushdie and Fay Weldon, and film director Derek Jarman, however The Court dismissed the claim and accepted that the criminal law of blasphemy, as it was applied in England, did not infringe the right to freedom of expression under Article 10. In 1994, Wingrove had also contested the BBFC's refusal to grant a certificate to the films Bare Behind Bars, Demoniac (aka Exorcism, 1974) and Sadomania at the Video Appeals Committee, though without success. Visions of Ecstasy was eventually released uncut in 2012, following the 2008 repeal of the UK's blasphemy laws. Other work Designs Wingrove is also known for his design work, which has a dark erotic style. He has worked on the fetish magazine Skin Two and, from 1992 to 1996, he was involved with the emerging Black Metal band Cradle of Filth, who licensed a number of Wingrove's images for use as their artwork on albums and t-shirts including the infamous \\"Jesus is a Cunt\\" design. Wingrove went on to art direct three albums for the band, the last being Dusk... and Her Embrace, though a great many of Wingrove's conceived images can be found in the definitive book on the band, \\"Gospel of Filth\\" (Fab Press, 2009), written by Gavin Baddeley. Publications Wingrove has two books published; \\"The Art of the Nasty\\", co-authored with Marc Morris, and \\"Blood and Dishonour: The Dark, Bloody and Peversely Erotic World of the Satanic Sluts ‚Äì Satan‚Äôs True Sirens\\". Wingrove has also designed and edited several similarly themed inhouse magazines for Salvation Films, including The Redeemer (1992 - 1995), and the newspaper styled Nihilista (2007-2008) and oversaw the redesign and relaunched of Rule Satannia, a satanic themed magazine linked to the Church of Satan. Wingrove also writes a regular blog, and runs the related quasi arts and politics site \\"Scum Nation\\". Wingrove is currently writing his first major reference work, \\"Strength Through Design ‚Äì Print Propaganda in the Third Reich\\" which looks in detail at the magazines and newspapers published by the NSDAP between 1920 and 1945. Art Wingrove is currently working on an exhibition of new images inspired by his book, Strength Through Design ‚Äì Print Propaganda in the Third Reich.

If a tenant reports sanitary violations or violations of minimum housing standards, the landlord cannot evict the tenant in retaliation for reporting the poor housing conditions. History Retaliatory eviction first appeared as a tenant's defense against eviction in Edwards v. Habib (1968), where a tenant was evicted after reporting sanitary code violations. The D.C. Circuit recognized that the eviction was unjustified because it was in retaliation for the reporting of violations.Casner, A.J. et al. Cases and Text on Property, Fifth Edition. Aspen Publishers, New York, NY: 2004, p. 504 As a defense The defense of retaliatory eviction was first recognized in the D.C. Circuit case Edwards v. Habib. West Virginia In the case Imperial Colliery Co. v. Fout,Imperial Colliery Co. v. Fout, 179 W.Va. 776 (1988) the West Virginia Supreme Court reaffirmed that retaliatory eviction was a valid defense against eviction, but added the condition that the retaliation must be against a tenant's exercise of a right incidental to their tenancy. Therefore, a defense of retaliatory eviction did not exist for a tenant evicted after participating in a labor strike. California 1942.5 is the California Civil Code that establishes a renter's rights and defines a Retaliatory Eviction in the state of California. As a cause of action Retaliatory eviction was first recognized as a cause of action in the California case Aweeka v. Bonds.Aweeka v. Bonds, 20 Cal.App.3d 278 (1971) The case recognized the inequity of forcing the tenant to wait until they were confronted with an unlawful detainer action to bring up retaliatory eviction as a defense.

He is the Chairman of the Peel Group, a property investment enterprise that mainly invests in North West England. Although publicity-shy, he has been named as one of the most influential business leaders for Greater Manchester and the North West by the Manchester Evening News (2007) and was named the most influential northerner by The Big Issue magazine in 2010 thanks to his large investments in North West England and wider afield in Northern England. According to The Sunday Times Rich List in 2019, Whittaker is worth ¬£1.95 billion, a decrease of ¬£300 million from 2018. Early life Whittaker was born to John and May Whittaker in Bury, Lancashire in 1942. He was educated at Prior Park College, a Catholic boarding school in Bath, Somerset, and considered becoming a priest before deciding to join the family business, Peel Mills. The Peel Group In the 1980s he fought a bitter battle to take over the Manchester Ship Canal Company, out of which the Trafford Centre emerged. Whittaker sold the 1.5m sq ft Trafford Centre to Capital Shopping Centres (now Intu Properties) in January 2011. Under the terms of the deal, which valued the Manchester scheme at ¬£1.6 billion, his company, Peel, took shares in CSC worth ¬£636m and he joined its board as deputy chairman. Whittaker resigned as deputy chairman in July 2020 following the company going into administration. In 2010, his wealth doubled from ¬£1.01 billion to ¬£2.07 billion, mainly thanks to the ¬£1.65 billion sale of the Trafford Centre. In 2011, Peel bid to increase its approximately 30% stake in the Pinewood Studios Group to 100% through a bid against fellow billionaire, Mohamed Al Fayed. After increasing the bid to ¬£96.1 million ($160 million), it appeared the bid would be successful. The group also bought MediaCityUK, a development in the northern English city of Salford, Greater Manchester, that will serve as the BBC‚Äôs new headquarters. In 2013, Peel Group started an Ocean Gateway project, aiming to transform 50 miles of industrial land between the Port of Liverpool and Salford Docks into a ¬£50 billion redevelopment called ‚ÄúOcean Gateway‚Äù. Whittaker hoped the Manchester development would become a Chinese business hub. He accompanied the Prime Minister on his trade mission to Beijing in 2010. According to The Sunday Times Rich List in 2019, Whittaker is worth ¬£1.95 billion, a decrease of ¬£300 million from 2018. In June 2019, The Sunday Times reported that Peel was liquidating stakes in Peel Ports and Liverpool airport to cover losses at Intu Properties where Peel Group owned 27.3%. Business reputation Whittaker has been regarded as a publicity-shy businessman who rarely gives interviews. In 2010 when Simon Property Group attempted to purchase the Trafford Centre, insiders saw Whittaker as \\"formidable opposition\\" and a \\"very astute, very clever and a very good businessman\\". One such example of his astute business mind was convincing the BBC to reject three other sites across Manchester to move to MediaCityUK in Salford Quays. The presence of the BBC would then act as a magnet to attract indie production companies to Salford and the Peel Group would make money from the rent and lease agreements on the development. Personal life Whittaker currently lives on the Isle of Man where he owns Billown Mansion. He has five children Mark, James, Kate, John and Max. Whittaker donated ¬£1m to Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. The donation was partly attributed to personal feelings for the cause.

Structure  At the present about 100 specialists work in the Centre. Among them 1 member of International Academy of Astronautics, 1 Doctors of Sciences, and 9 Candidates of Sciences (PhD). LC ISR consists of 3 scientific departments and 1 laboratory, and performs fundamental and applied researches in the following interdisciplinary scientific directions: * propagation theory and experimental study of electromagnetic fields in conducting media (space plasma, ground, sea water); * development of advanced sensors and systems for measuring the parameters of physical fields and data collection and processing for space industry and geophysical applications. Development and production of flux-gate magnetometers (FGM) and induction magnetometers (IM) with highest parameters values possible are of the main LC ISR activity areas. Reduction of weight, energy loss and noise level can be placed among main directions of FGM and IM designing, which aims to reach world standards level. The Center with its engineering divisions has made significant contribution into solution of large-scale fundamental and applied scientific problems, including: * development of theoretical substantiation of lithosphere-ionosphere coupling through the acoustic and atmospheric gravity waves with the aim to clarify mechanism of ionospheric earthquakes precursors formation; * development of the mechanism of earthquakes electromagnetic precursors recognition in focal area and designing specialized instruments for these precursors detection; * studying of electronic circuits interaction process with the aim to provide as low as possible sensitivity threshold of measuring devices for space, ground and sea bed applications; * development and adoption of new methodology to provide autonomous objects electromagnetic cleanliness, and to realize their calibration without operation process interruption; * adoption of space instrumentation development technology for manufacturing advanced geophysical systems, used for scientific research and raw materials prospecting (oil, gas etc.).  Significant scientific achievements and development  More than 10 spatial experiments were carried out with the participation of LC ISR specialists. LC ISR proposed scientific conception of the first national scientific experiment ‚ÄúVariant‚Äù (—É–∫—Ä. –í–∞—Ä—ñ–∞–Ω—Ç) on the board of artificial satellite ‚ÄúSich-1M‚Äù with international scientific payload.http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/sich-1m.htm For the first time in the world practice direct density of space current in plasma measurements were performed. A generalized approach to the recognition of the precursory signals of earthquakes preparation process when structural changes and anomalies occur in the Earth crust was proposed. A new physical effect ‚Äì gamma ‚Äì magnetic normalization of alloys with high magnetic permeability was discovered and experimentally confirmed. A general concept and theoretical basis of the construction of a high-sensitive geophysical system for active electromagnetic logging in wells to study anisotropy of rocks and to detect the near-surface inhomogeneities were created with the aim to develop the new methods of minerals exploration. The scientific concept and realization plan of the ground-spatial experiments ‚ÄúIonosphere‚Äù and ‚ÄúPotential‚Äù were developed. Technical documents substantiating the above experiments were prepared. They were included in the National Space Program of Ukraine for 2013‚Äì2015 years.

The film depicts children as young as 12 years of age who work as many as 12 hours a day, six months a year, subject to hazardous conditions: heat exposure, pesticides, and dangerous work. The agriculture industry has been subject to significantly more lenient labor laws than any other occupation in the United States. As a result, lack of consistent schooling significantly limits their opportunities of succeeding in high school or more. The hazardous conditions threaten their health and lives. The purpose of the documentary is to bring awareness of the harsh working conditions which tens of thousands of children face in the fields of the United States each year and to enact the Children's Act for Responsible Employment (CARE Act, HR 3564) which will bring parity of labor conditions to field workers that are afforded to minors in other occupations. Background The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) has different standards for children working in agriculture than in any other industry. The Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs estimates that there are between 400,000 and 500,000 children working in the farming industry. Children as young as 12 years of age work in the fields. There is no minimum number of hours worked a day, aside from being outside school hours. They are exposed to the sun, harmful pesticides and hazardous conditions. Children are in up to three times greater danger of exposure to pesticides than adults due to their size and stage of development. The fatality rate is six times that in any other industry: children account for 20% of all deaths on farms. Although agriculture is a hazardous occupation, no statistics are maintained on child laborers and serious accidents. Children who work on farms or in fields spend on average 30 hours a week, even during times of the year when school is in session. Of the children who work on farms, 50% of them will not graduate from high school. The United States Department of Labor estimates that children earn about $1,000 in one year. Production The Harvest is a feature documentary film on the life of migrant children and their families in the United States. It revisits Edward R. Murrow‚Äôs Harvest of Shame, filmed 53 years ago, and reveals that little has changed over the past five decades in the lives of migrant farm workers in the United States. The Harvest, however, is told from a child's perspective as it presents three of the more than 400,000 children between the ages of 5 and 16 who labor in fields and factories, lacking the protections offered by the Fair Labor Standards Act that all other American children enjoy. The film profiles several children and their families as they work through the 2009 - 2010 harvest seasons, facing risks of being separated, deported or death. A twelve-year-old girl, Zulema L., works in a field of strawberries. One of her earliest memories is being taught by her mother to pick and clean strawberries. Zulema struggles academically because of the family's seasonal movement. She has attended eight different schools in eight years. Not confident that she will make it to high school, she has no dreams about what her future could hold. The documentary tracks other children with their own stories of living a life of a child laborer. Work began on the documentary in June 2007 and through the 2009 - 2010 harvests. In that time the project has followed harvests in Minnesota, North Dakota, Texas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Ohio. The documentary was shot with cinematic scope. Post-production began in early winter 2010, with the completion of the film in fall 2010. The Harvest was produced by Shine Global in association with Globalvision, Romano Film and Photography, and Eva Longoria's UnbeliEVAble Productions. Longoria signed on as an executive producer of the project in 2009. It was directed by U. Roberto (Robin) Romano, photographer of Faces of Freedom. Screenings The Harvest premiered at the International Documentary Film Festival IDFA in Amsterdam in November 2010, and at the Guadalajara International Film Festival in Guadalajara, Mexico on March 26, 2011. Distributed by Cinema Libre, The film had its theatrical debut in New York City on July 29, 2011, and became available on DVD October 2011. CARE legislation Eva Longoria, director U. Roberto Romano, and associate director Julia Perez visited Capitol Hill to mark the anniversary of Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard‚Äôs introduction of the CARE Act legislation in September 2009. The Children‚Äôs Act for Responsible Employment (CARE Act, HR 3564) addresses the harshest conditions that tens of thousands of children as young as 12 years of age may be subject to, such as restrictions in the number of hours that children work in a day. The intention of the bill is to raise the standard for children working in agriculture to that of any other occupation in the United States. As of September 1, 2010 the bill had 103 co-sponsors. While on Capitol Hill, Longoria and Romano showed scenes from the feature-length documentary to illustrate the harsh working conditions and exploitation of children in the fields. A trailer of the film was first privately screened at a United States Department of Labor panel discussion, hosted by Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis and including Dolores Huerta of the United Farm Workers, filmmaker Robin Romano, Mark Lara from the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division, and other experts. During the presentation, details of Roybal-Allard's bill were outlined: a child must be a minimum of 14 years of age to work in the fields, children under the age of 16 are restricted from working in the fields if it affects their health or school performance, and children under the age of 18 are restricted from hazardous work. United Nations  On August 12 of 2014, the film's Associate Director, Julia Perez, spoke before the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on behalf of farm worker rights and child labor in U.S. agriculture. The UN press release mentioned exposure to pesticides, wage theft, sexual assault, police harassment and other illegal working conditions faced by children -- largely Latino children who either were born in the United States or migrated with their families.

The cabin was constructed in 1879, and became the official post office of Muddy Creek (now Emery), Emery County, Utah in the 1880s.The History of Emery County, Edward Geary, 1996 The cabin is currently located in the Utah State Park system at This Is The Place Heritage Park. History 220px The cabin was one of two built by settlers Charles Johnson and Joseph Lund on Muddy Creek homesteads. While earlier arrivals had lived in \\"dugouts\\" the Lund cabin was the first log home to be built in the area.Castle Valley, America: hard land, hard-won home. Nancy Jacobus Taniguchi 2004 When Lund moved back to Spring City, rancher Casper Christensen moved his family into the abandoned cabin. Christensen was named postmaster of the area in 1882, and his log home became the official post office of both Muddy Creek and Quitchupah. The logs were cut and hauled from nearby Miller‚Äôs canyon. The logs were smoothed on one-side with grooves chopped in each end. They were then placed on top of each other with the smooth side facing inward. Chinks between the logs were filled with mud or clay. Willows were used for lath, nailed to the logs, and plastered with mud. The mud was then rubbed smooth and painted with a whitewash of lime. The roof was made with cedar shingles. Post Office In 1879, people had settled in Muddy Creek Canyon, establishing a town that was known as \\"Muddy\\" for short.Castle Valley: History of Emery County. Stella McElprang 2000 No one seems to know exactly why the town of Muddy received the name of Emery instead of keeping the name Muddy as it was originally called by the Postmaster General when Casper Christensen was first officially appointed postmaster of Muddy on December 1, 1883. His daughter Hannah was appointed as his assistant. Perhaps it was in honor of Governor George W. Emery who became the territory‚Äôs Chief Executive in 1875 and for whom the state officials christened Emery County in 1880.Emery Town, Emery Town Historical Committee, (1981) The first settlers were able to get mail once a month, in the summer, and not at all in the winter. It was brought by horseback from San Pete County, through Salina Canyon by anyone who might be going through. In 1882, mail service to Muddy Creek was improved to once a week, making a 60-mile trek from Price, Utah.History of Emery County. Daughter of Utah Pioneers. 2000 Casper played a prominent role in Emery affairs during the settlement era. Prior to his appointment of postmaster, Casper was appointed Presiding Elder of the Muddy Branch of the LDS Church. In addition to a post office, the building also served the town as a doctor‚Äôs office, with Wiley Payne Allred, a former bodyguard of Joseph Smith‚Äôs, using his in-laws post office as a place to set broken limbs, extract teeth and apply herbal remedies. Demise and restoration After a few years of stock raising and farming the settlers could see there was not enough farmland along the creek. Larger tracts of land lay several miles south of Muddy Creek suitable for dry farming. A canal was constructed in 1886 that diverted water from the Muddy to new available farm land. The present town site of Emery was surveyed in 1887. Almost immediately the settlers from Muddy and Quitchupah began filing on land and preparing to build homes. The town on Muddy Creek became a ghost town, leaving several structures still on its banks including the old post office as a new building was established in Emery. In the 1920s, Clyde Mortensen, being newly married and in need of home, went with a team of horses and relocated the old post office to Emery to function as temporary home, while he constructed a more modern home. The post office was utilized as a storage facility, and the cabin avoided being scrapped, similar to other pioneer cabins constructed in that era. In the early 2000s, Shaun Delliskave, a grandson of Clyde Mortensen, donated the cabin to This Is The Place Heritage Park in Salt Lake City. The cabin is of historic importance as it is one of the few surviving frontier post offices to still exist. Some controversy ensued when it was found that the cabin was not being carefully preserved until renovation. The park fully renovated the cabin in 2009, titling it the \\"Emery County Cabin\\". The Utah Home Builder's Association (HBA) adopted the building through This is The Place Foundation's \\"Adopt-a-Home\\" program. HBA helped reconstruct and provide assistance to the renovation of the frontier post office. Due to its historical multipurpose, it will serve as home to the park's interpretive potter. This entry will be the park's first entry from Emery County. The cabin at This Is The Place Heritage Park was dedicated on June 20, 2009. In conjunction with the dedication, the park held Emery County Day, where Emery County residents were granted free admission for the festivities. Ellis V. Allred, a great-grandson of Casper Christensen, dedicated the cabin.

He is the assistant coach of the Chinese Super League side Shandong Luneng. Player career Club career As with many of the most promising youth players from China, Hao Wei was sent to Brazil for a training programme sponsored by Jianlibao in 1997 with fellow youth prospects Li Tie and Zhang Xiaorui. When he returned to start his professional football career he would join Shandong Luneng in 1998, however he found it difficult to immediately break into the team due to injury, though he was able to play in 11 league games and score 1 goal. It was not until the 1999 league season that Hao Wei would rise to prominence when he established himself as Shandong's first choice right back and help them to a league and cup double. His importance to the Shandong team would quickly fade when new manager Valeri Nepomniachi preferred the emerging Jiao Zhe as his first choice right back and by the end of 2002 league season Hao Wei was allowed to leave. Hao Wei would join Shanxi Guoli at the beginning of the 2003 league season where despite being an immediate regular for the team he was unable to help them in their relegation battle to remain in the top tier. Unable to hold on to Hao Wei, Shanxi Guoli would allow him to leave the club for Beijing Guoan at the beginning of the 2004 league season where he would fight for the right back position with Zhang Shuai for the next two seasons before going to Changsha Ginde where he ended his playing career. International career Hao Wei would make his senior debut in a friendly against Hong Kong on April 25, 2000 in a 1‚Äì0 win. He would play in another friendly in preparation for the 2000 AFC Asian Cup, however when the squad was chosen for the tournament he was unable to be included. With the emergence of Xu Yunlong and Sun Jihai as the preferred options at right back Hao Wei saw his playing time severely limited. He was brought in to play a Fifa World Cup Qualifier on September 8, 2004 against Malaysia in a 1‚Äì0 win, however this was to prove to be his last game. Management career After he retired his playing career with Changsha Ginde he would take an assistant management position with them. This was a position he held on to until October 12, 2009 when the Changsha Ginde head coach Zhu Bo was sacked and he was named as the new head coach to replace him. Under his reign he would guide the club from away relegation, however the following season he was unable to improve the teams' performances and on 16 June 2010, Hao became the assistant coach to Serbian manager Miodrag Je≈°iƒá. Hao would soon leave Changsha to take up a position within the Chinese Women team, however when they were unable to qualify for the Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics and the manager Li Xiaopeng resigned, which saw Hao promoted. Hao was banned from the national team's round of 16 match at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup because he interfered with a New Zealand player during his team's last group stage match.

Some scholars have attributed it to Leonardo da Vinci but the attribution and the work's authenticity have been disputed. Some of those who disagree with the attribution to Leonardo believe the portrait is by an early 19th-century German artist imitating the style of the Italian Renaissance, although radiocarbon dating tests show a much earlier date for the vellum. It has also been denounced as a forgery. The white lead has been dated to be at least 225 years old. The work sold for just under $22,000 at auction in 1998, and was bought by its current owner Peter Silverman in 2007. He has championed the attribution to Leonardo, supported by the analysis of academics Martin Kemp and Pascal Cotte. The drawing was shown as a Leonardo in an exhibition in Sweden in 2010 and was estimated by various newspaper reports to be worth more than $160 million. The Bella Principessa remains locked in a vault in a secret Swiss location. According to Kemp and Cotte, the sheet was cut from a Milanese vellum book, La Sforziada, in Warsaw, which celebrates the marriage in 1496 of Galeazzo Sanseverino with Bianca, the illegitimate daughter of Ludovico Sforza, Leonardo's employer. It has subsequently been exhibited in Urbino, Monza and Nanjing; and a facsimile edition of the portrait and the book in Warsaw has been published.Scripta Maneant Description The portrait is a mixed media drawing in pen and brown ink with red, black and white chalk, on vellum, which has been laid down on an oak board. There are signs of restoration with thin paint applied with a brush. Three stitch holes in the left-hand margin of the vellum, indicate that the leaf was once in a bound volume. It represents a girl in her early teens, depicted in profile, the usual way in which Italian artists of the 15th century portraited women. The girl's dress and hairstyle indicate that she was a member of the Court of Milan during the 1490s. If it truly is a Renaissance work, it would have been executed in the 1490s according to Kemp and Cotte. If the subject is Bianca Sforza it would date from 1496, the year of her marriage and her death. Reflecting the subject of an Italian woman of high nobility, Kemp named the portrait La Bella Principessa, although acknowledging that Sforza ladies were not princesses. Provenance If the drawing is originally a Leonardo illustration for the present-day Warsaw copy of the Sforziad, its history is the same as that of the book until the drawing was cut out from the volume.See Katarzyna Wozniak, The Warsaw Sforziad http://www.bbk.ac.uk/hosted/leonardo/#MM The book is known to have been rebound at the turn of the 18th and 19th century.Katarzyna Wozniak, The Warsaw Sforziad http://www.bbk.ac.uk/hosted/leonardo/#MMKatarzyna Wo≈∫niak, La Bella Principessa and the Warsaw Sforziad. Circumstances of Rebinding and Excision of the Portrait http://www.bbk.ac.uk/hosted/leonardo/#MM The modern provenance of the drawing is known only from 1955 and is documented only from 1998. According to a lawsuit brought by Jeanne Marchig against Christie's after the drawing's re-attribution to Leonardo, the drawing belonged to her husband Giannino Marchig, an art restorer, when they married in 1955. Jeanne Marchig became the owner of the drawing in 1983, following her husband's death. The work was included in a sale at Christie's in New York on January 30, 1998, catalogued as Young Girl in Profile in Renaissance Dress, and described as \\"German School, early 19th Century\\". The seller was Jeanne Marchig. It was sold for $21,850 (including buyer's premium) to a New York art dealer who sold it on for a similar amount in 2007. In 2007, art dealer Peter Silverman, purchased the portrait from a gallery on East 73rd Street, owned by Kate Ganz. Peter Silverman believed that the portrait was possibly from an older period, potentially dating back to the Renaissance period, and sought the opinions of experts who have since attributed it to Leonardo da Vinci. In 2010 one of those experts, Martin Kemp, made it the subject of his book co-authored with Pascal Cotte, La Bella Principessa: The Story of the New Masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci. This is now revised in Kemp and Cotte's La Bella Principessa di Leonardo da Vinci. Ritratto di Bianca Sforza, Florence, 2012. The drawing was shown as a Leonardo in a 2010 exhibition called And there was Light in Eriksberg, Gothenburg, in Sweden, and was estimated by various newspaper reports to be worth more than $160 million. Silverman promoted the Leonardo connection in his 2012 book Leonardo's Lost Princess: One Man's Quest to Authenticate an Unknown Portrait by Leonardo da Vinci and has declined an offer for the portrait of $80 million.  The Fingerprint dispute  Pascal Cotte of Lumi√®re Technology in Paris performed a multi-spectral digital scan of the work.Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. The high resolution images were used by Peter Paul Biro, a forensic art examiner who studied a fingerprint on the vellum which he said was \\"highly comparable\\" to a fingerprint on Leonardo's unfinished St. Jerome in the Wilderness.Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. In 2010 David Grann published an article about the drawing in The New Yorker, which implied that Biro had been involved with forged paintings attributed to Jackson Pollock. Biro consequently sued the writer and the publisher of the New Yorker Advance Media for defamation in 2011. The judge in the case, J. Paul Oetken, ruled that the article contained eight instances that were capable of a defamatory meaning. He eventually dismissed the case on a technicality arguing that Biro was a limited purpose public figure. An appeals court supported the initial judgment. The New Yorker article was republished in 2018 and Biro sued the New Yorker again for republication of a potentially defamatory article. The case is before the court and a ruling is expected. Biro is an analyst and not an \\"authenticator\\". He continues to practice art analytics as he has for the past 40 years. The fingerprint evidence is not cited in the revised Italian edition of the book by Kemp and Cotte or in any of Kemp‚Äôs subsequent publications.Ital ed. and exhib The story of the research and attribution is told in Kemp's Living with Leonardo.Martin Kemp, Living with Leonardo. Fifty Years of Sanity and Insanity in the Art World and Beyond, London: Thames and Hudson, 2018David Grann, ‚ÄòThe Mark of a Masterpiece‚Äô, The New Yorker, July 12, 2010. https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/07/12/the-mark-of-a-masterpiece Support for Leonardo attribution A portrait by Ambrogio da Predis of Bianca Maria Sforza showing a similar hairstyle (National Gallery of Art) Detail of the upper left corner, revealing a fingerprint which has been suggested as being similar to one of Leonardo's. A page of La Sforziada from the National Library of Poland (Biblioteka Narodowa) in Warsaw The first study of the drawing was published by Cristina Geddo. Geddo attributes this work to Leonardo based not only on stylistic considerations, extremely high quality and left-handed hatching, but also on the evidence of the combination of black, white and red chalks (the trois crayons technique). Leonardo was the first artist in Italy to use pastels, a drawing technique he had learned from the French artist Jean Perr√©al, whom he met in Milan in 1494 and/ or 1499. Leonardo acknowledges his debt to Perr√©al in the Codex Atlanticus. Geddo also points out that the \\"coazzone\\" of the sitter's hairstyle was fashionable during the same period. Strong support for the attribution has come from Elizabetta Gnignera, the costume historian, in her book La Bella Svelata, which studies a wide range of comparative costumes and hair styles. Expert opinions A number of Leonardo experts and art historians have concurred with the attribution to Leonardo, including: * Martin Kemp, Emeritus Research Professor in the History of Art at the University of Oxford, * Carlo Pedretti, late professor emeritus of art history and Armand Hammer Chair in Leonardo Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles * Nicholas Turner, former curator at the British Museum and the J. Paul Getty Museum * Alessandro Vezzosi, the director of the Museo Ideale Leonardo da Vinci in Vinci, ItalyAlessandro Vezzosi, Nuptial Portrait of a Young Woman * Cristina Geddo, an expert on Milanese Leonardesques and Giampietrino, * Mina Gregori, professor emerita at the University of Florence.Esterow, Milton. \\"The Real Thing?\\", in ARTnews Analysis In 2010, after a two-year study of the picture, Kemp published his findings and conclusions in a book, La Bella Principessa: The Story of the New Masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci. Kemp describes the work as \\"a portrait of a young lady on the cusp of maturity [which] shows her with the fashionable costume and hairstyle of a Milanese court lady in the 1490s\\". By process of elimination involving the inner group of young Sforza women, Kemp suggested that she is probably Bianca Sforza, the illegitimate (but later legitimized) daughter of Ludovico Sforza (\\"Il Moro\\"), duke of Milan. In 1496, when Bianca was no more than 14, she married Galeazzo Sanseverino, captain of the duke's Milanese forces and a patron of Leonardo. Bianca was dead within months of her marriage, having suffered from a stomach complaint (possibly an ectopic pregnancy). Kemp pointed out that Milanese ladies were often the dedicatees of volumes of poetry on vellum, and that such a portrait of a \\"beloved lady\\" would have made a suitable title page or main illustration for a set of verses produced on the occasion of her marriage or death. The physical and scientific evidence from multispectral analysis and study of the painting, as described by Kemp in the first edition of his book with Cotte, may be summarized as follows: * The technique of the portrait is black, red and white chalks (trois crayons, a French medium), with pen and ink. * The drawing and hatching was carried out entirely by a left-handed artist, as Leonardo is known to have been, although restorations are by a right-hander. * There are significant pentimenti. * The portrait is characterized by particularly subtle details, such as the relief of the ear hinted at below the hair, and the amber of the sitter's iris. * There are strong stylistic parallels with the Windsor silverpoint drawing of A Woman in Profile, which, like other head studies by Leonardo, features comparable delicate pentimenti to the profile. * The members of the Sforza family were always portrayed in profile, whereas Ludovico's mistresses were not. * The proportions of the head and face reflect the rules that Leonardo articulated in his notebooks. * The interlace or knotwork ornament in the costume and caul corresponds to patterns that Leonardo explored in other works and in the logo designs for his Academy. * The portrait was executed on vellum‚Äîused by him in his illustrations for Luca Pacioli's De divina proportione (1498). We know from his writings that he was interested in the French technique of dry colouring on parchment (vellum). He specifically noted that he should ask the French artist, Jean Perr√©al, who was in Milan in 1494 and perhaps on other occasions, about the method of colouring in dry chalks. * The format of the vellum support is that of a rectangle, a format used for several of his portraits. * The vellum sheet was cut from a codex, probably a volume of poetry of the kind presented to mark major events in the Sforza women's lives. * The vellum includes a palmprint in the chalk pigment on the neck of the sitter, which is characteristic of Leonardo's technique. * The green of the sitter's costume was obtained with a simple diffusion of black chalk applied on top of the yellowish tone of the vellum support. (Kemp has subsequently expressed reservations about this evidence.) * The nuances of the flesh tints were also achieved by exploiting the tone of the vellum and allowing it to show through the transparent media. * There are noteworthy similarities between this work and the portrait of Cecilia Gallerani, including the handling of the eyes, the modelling of flesh tones using the palm of the hand, the intricacy of the patterns of the knotwork ornament and the treatment of the contours. * The now somewhat pale original hatching in pen and ink was retouched in ink in a later restoration, which is far less fluid, precise and rhythmic. * There have been some re-touchings over the years, most extensively in the costume and headdress, but the restoration has not affected the expression and physiognomy of the face to a significant degree, and has not seriously affected the overall impact of the portrait. Warsaw copy of the Sforziada In 2011, after the publication of the first edition of their book, Kemp and Pascal Cotte reported that there was evidence that the drawing had once been part of a copy in the National Library of Poland in Warsaw of the Sforziada. to \\"turn-the pages\\" for the Warsaw copy of the Sforziada This is a printed book with hand-illuminated additions containing a long propagandistic poem in praise of the father of Ludovico Sforza, who was Leonardo's patron, recounting the career. The Warsaw copy, printed on vellum with added illumination, was given to Galeazzo Sanseverino, a military commander under Ludovico Sforza, on his marriage to Bianca Sforza in 1496. Kemp and Cotte identified where two sheets were missing from this volume from which they believe the drawing was cut. Kemp and Cotte say that, although \\"the dimensions and precise locations of the holes in the portrait cannot be obtained with precision\\", the three holes on the left-hand side of the drawing can be aligned with three of the five stitch holes in the sheets in the book.Kemp and Cotte believe the difference in the number of holes is due either to the irregular way in which the margin of the page with the drawing has been cut, or to the addition of two intermediate stitches when the book was rebound. According to Kemp and Cotte, the association with the Sforziada suggests that the drawing is a portrait of Bianca Sforza, who was the daughter of Ludovico Sforza and his mistress Bernardina de Corradis. At the time of the portrait, she was around thirteen years old. Leonardo painted three other portraits associated with the family or court of Ludovico Sforza. The Polish scholar Bogdan Horodyski in 1954-1956 reached the conclusion that the Warsaw illumination refers to both the deceased dukes Galeazzo Maria and Gian Galeazzo and to the dynastic downfall after the usurpation of Ludovico il Moro. The reproduction of the unpublished heraldic figure attributed to Antonio Grifo, illuminated in the incunabulum \\"Comedia\\" by Dante (Cremonese, Venice 1491), now at Casa di Dante in Rome, shows the original coat of arms and insignia of the family of Galeazzo Sanseverino, and the comparison with those illuminated by Birago is not corresponding. Developing this hypothesis, Carla Glori suggests that Caterina Sforza, the daughter of Galeazzo Maria and half-sister of Gian Galeazzo, was the owner of the Warsaw Sforziad and that she gave it to the family of her deceased half-brother between 1496-1499.Glori, Carla, ‚ÄúThe Illumination by Birago in the Sforziad incunabulum in Warsaw: in defense of Horodyski's thesis and a new hypothesis‚Äù, Academia.edu Horodyski‚Äôs ideas have recently been revived by Katarzyna Krzyzag√≥rska-Pisarek in her ‚ÄúLa Bella Principessa. Arguments against the Attribution to Leonardo‚Äù, Artibus et Historiae, XXXVI, 215, pp. 61‚Äì 89. Pisarek is a member of Artwatch UK, which has offered polemic denunciations of Kemp. Opposition for Leonardo attribution The New Yorker article discussed the troubling circumstances in which Kemp attributed this work to Leonardo. But apart from this, strong indications are going against the hypothesis of authenticity, and the attribution to Leonardo has been challenged by a number of scholars who showed interest. Among the reasons for doubting its authorship are the lack of provenance prior to the 20th century ‚Äì unusual given Leonardo's renown dating from his own lifetime, as well as the fame of the purported subject's family ‚Äì and the fact that it was on vellum. Only once did Leonardo use vellum and old sheets of it are easily acquired by forgers. Leonardo scholar Pietro C. Marani discounts the significance of the drawing being made by a left-handed artist, noting that imitators of Leonardo's work have emulated this characteristic in the past. Marani is also troubled by use of vellum, \\"monotonous\\" detail, use of colored pigments in specific areas, firmness of touch and lack of craquelure. A museum director who wished to remain anonymous believes the drawing is \\"a screaming 20th-century fake\\", and finds the damages and repair to the drawing suspicious. The work was not requested for inclusion in the 2011‚Äì12 exhibition at the National Gallery in London, which specifically covered Leonardo's period in Milan; Nicholas Penny, director of the National Gallery, said simply \\"We have not asked to borrow it.\\" Carlo Pedretti, one of the scholars who attribute this work to Leonardo, had before made a mistake attributing a painting from the twentieth century to the Master.Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. It has been claimed that Leonardo never represented eyelashes, in his paintings as well as in his drawings, which is not accurate, given eyelashes in drawings in Windsor. Klaus Albrecht Schr√∂der, director of the Albertina, Vienna, said \\"No one is convinced it is a Leonardo,\\" and David Ekserdjian, a scholar of 16th-century Italian drawings, wrote that he suspects the work is a \\"counterfeit\\". Neither Carmen Bambach of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one of the primary scholars of Leonardo's drawings, nor Everett Fahy, her colleague at the Metropolitan, accepts the attribution to Leonardo. Several forensic experts on fingerprints have discounted Biro's conclusions, finding the partial fingerprint taken from the drawing too poorly detailed to offer conclusive evidence. Biro's description of the print as being \\"highly comparable\\" to a known fingerprint of Leonardo's has similarly been discounted by fingerprint examiners as being too vague an assessment to establish authorship. When asked if he may have been mistaken to suggest that the fingerprint was Leonardo's, Biro answered \\"It's possible. Yes.\\" Kemp‚Äôs later publications do not use the finger-print evidence in support of the attribution. Noting the lack of mention of dissenting opinion in Kemp's publication, Richard Dorment, the former husband of Ganz, wrote in the Telegraph: \\"Although purporting to be a work of scholarship, his book has none of the balanced analysis you would expect from such an acclaimed historian. For La Bella Principessa, as he called the girl in the study, is not art history ‚Äì it is advocacy.\\" Fred R. Kline, an independent art historian and author of Leonardo's Holy Child--The Discovery of a Leonardo da Vinci Masterpiece: A Connoisseur's Search for Lost Art in America, is known for his discovery of ‚ÄúLeonardo's model drawing‚Äù of Infant Jesus (which has yet to be accepted by Leonardo scholars) and for a number of important discoveries of lost art by the Nazarene Brotherhood, a group of German painters working in Rome during the early 19th century who revived the styles and subjects of the Italian Renaissance. Kline has proposed one of the Nazarenes, Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld (1794‚Äì1872), as the creator of the drawing. In evidence, Kline points to a drawing on vellum by Schnorr, Half- nude Female, in the collection of the Kunsthalle Mannheim in Germany,image of the Mannheim drawing which he suggests depicts the same model, although older, as portrayed in La Bella Principessa. Comparative material-testing of the vellum supports of the Mannheim Schnorr and La Bella Principessa were anticipated to occur in the New York federal court lawsuit Marchig v. Christie's, brought in May 2010 by the original owner of La Bella Principessa, who accused Christie's of breach of fiduciary duty, negligent misrepresentation and other claims. However, the court dismissed the suit on the ground that the claims were brought years too late (Statute of Limitations and Laches), and thus the merits of the suit were never addressed. The district court decision was upheld on appeal.Marchig v. Christie's Inc., 762 F. Supp. 2d 667 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd in relevant part, 2011 WL 2685608 (2d Cir. Summary Order July 12, 2011). Disagreements with the attribution to Leonardo were made before the discovery of the missing page in the Warsaw Sforziada book. No alternative attribution has been accepted by Kemp or his research group. Kline claims that no comparative scientific analysis has been made of the vellum supports in question: the Warsaw Sforziada book, the Mannheim Schnorr (an alternate attribution), and La Bella Principessa, although Kemp and Cotte have shown a close match between the vellum of the portrait and the book. Further analysis of the vellum could possibly provide the conclusive evidence that may support or disqualify Schnorr's authorship. In November 2015, notorious art forger Shaun Greenhalgh claimed that he created the work in 1978, at the age of 20; Greenhalgh said the woman's face is that of a supermarket check-out girl named Sally who worked in Bolton, outside Manchester. In his memoir A Forger's Tale, written in prison, Greenhalgh claims as a 17 year old to have forged the drawing by obtaining an old piece of vellum from a reused 1587 land deed. Kemp said he found the claim hilarious and ridiculous. Popular culture The work of art was studied on the PBS program NOVA in 2012 in a program titled Mystery of a Masterpiece, from NOVA/National Geographic/PBS, which aired on January 25, 2012.

Biography Born to German Mennonite parents in Friedensdorf (now Khmelnytskyi), Ukraine, Reimer studied to be a librarian before being drafted into the Soviet Army in 1940. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, Reimer entered combat and was captured by German forces on July 6. Two months later, due to his ethnic German heritage and language skills, he was recruited to the Trawniki concentration camp for training as a camp guard. While serving as a camp guard, Reimer participated in the liquidation of Jewish ghettos in Poland, in addition to administrative and office duties. On one occasion, Reimer fired a shot while at a pit containing corpses and at least one live civilian, which would later prove pivotal in his denaturalization trial. In 1944, he received a War Meritorious Medal for his service, and was promoted to Guard First Sergeant in 1945. In 1944, Reimer gained German citizenship after Adolf Hitler made all ethnic German military and police personnel eligible for German citizenship. He later applied for a visa to the United States in 1952 and was naturalized as a United States citizen on April 28, 1959. During his time in the United States, he worked as a Wise potato chip salesman and a restaurant manager, and lived in Brooklyn, New York. After he retired, he moved to Carmel, New York, and was living in Fort Lee, New Jersey at the time of his death. Reimer was first investigated by American authorities in 1980 in connection with the John Demjanjuk case, but little progress was made during this initial investigation. Not until the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of Communism in the Eastern Bloc did investigators make substantial progress, as formerly restricted archives were opened up to Western historians. In 1992 the Office of Special Investigations filed a denaturalization suit against Reimer, and following a bench trial in 1998, Reimer was denaturalized on September 5, 2002. He appealed his denaturalization, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld it on January 27, 2004. In 2005, the government sought to deport Reimer, and he agreed to leave for Germany, but he died before his deportation could be completed. Reimer, who was Trawniki recruit No. 865, figured predominantly in Citizen 865: The Hunt for Hitler's Hidden Soldiers in America.

V108 served in the Baltic and for training during the war, and when the German Navy was broken up after the end of the war, was allocated to Poland, with the name Kaszub. It was sunk on 20 July 1925 by a boiler explosion.  History  V108 was originally ordered by the Koninklijke Marine (Dutch Navy) as the torpedo boat Z-4 (along with sister ships Z-1, Z-2 and Z-3), one of four ' (Dutch: Very large) torpedo boats to be built by A.G. Vulcan in their Stettin, Germany (now Szczecin, Poland) shipyard. The four ships were taken over by Germany for incorporation into the Kaiserliche Marine (German Navy) while still under construction on 10 August 1914 owing to the outbreak of the First World War, with Z4 being renamed SMS V108. The ship was launched on 12 December 1914 and completed in March 1915. V108 was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a maximum draught of . Displacement was normal and full load. Two oil-fired and two coal-fired Yarrow boilers fed steam at to 2 direct-drive steam turbines rated at , giving a speed of . of coal and of oil were carried, giving a range of at or at . The Dutch specified an armament of two 75 mm (3-inch) guns and four 450 mm torpedo tubes, but the ship was completed with an armament of two 8.8 cm SK L/30 guns and two 450 mm torpedo tubes. V108 had a crew of three officers and 57 other ranks. Service World War I The newly completed V108 and joined the 10th Torpedo Boat Flotilla in the Baltic Sea in April 1915. That month, the German Army had begun an offensive in the Baltic as a diversion for the Gorlice‚ÄìTarn√≥w Offensive, with the Navy deployed in support of the Army's operations. On 24 April 1915, V108 shelled Russian troops near Palanga, Courland (now part of Lithuania). On the night of 30 April/1 May 1915, V107 and V108 made a sortie into the Gulf of Riga, reconnoitring the island of Ruhnu and shelling lighthouses. From 3 to 5 June 1915, German naval forces, including V108 carried out an attempted penetration of the Irben Strait with the intention of mining the southern entrance to the Moon Sound, while the seaplane carrier 's aircraft would attack a factory near Daugavgrƒ´va. The presence of large numbers of Russian warships (including 16 destroyers and torpedo boats) resulted in the operation being abandoned, but on the return journey to Libau, Glyndwr ran into a previously undiscovered Russian minefield off Windau on 4 June, striking one mine, which badly damaged the seaplane carrier, causing serious flooding. V108 took Glyndwr under tow, and with the assistance of minesweepers took Glyndwr back to Libau. In August 1915, V108 took part in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga, an attempt by German forces, supported by the High Seas Fleet, to enter the Gulf of Riga, destroy Russian naval forces in the Gulf and to mine the northern entrances to the Gulf in order to prevent Russian reinforcement. The attempt failed with Germany losing the torpedo boats and and the minesweeper T46, while failing to destroy any major Russian warships or lay the planned minefield. On 20 August, in one of the last actions of the battle, V108 took part in an attack on Pernau, with blockships being used to block the entrance to the harbour. In 1916, V108 was relegated to training duties, remaining on training duties at the end of the war.  Polish service  In June 1919, Treaty of Versailles required that the German Navy surrender most of its remaining warships for division between the victorious powers. In December 1919, Poland was allocated six torpedo boats, which were to supplied unarmed for police duties. One of the ships chosen by Poland was V-108, which was renamed Kaszub together with sister ship V-105 (which became and four smaller A-class coastal torpedo boats. Kaszub, after refit at Rosyth Dockyard, arrived at Danzig on 3 October 1921. (Like all of the torpedo boats transferred to Poland, Kaszub suffered mechanical problems and was delivered under tow). Kaszub was initially fitted with two 47 mm guns and two machine guns for service with the Polish Navy, but was rearmed in 1924‚Äì25, with two 75 mm guns and two 450 mm torpedo tubes, together with rails for laying mines.  Demise  On 20 July 1925, a boiler explosion wrecked Kaszub while in dock in Danzig, with the forward part of the ship sinking. Three crewmen died. The remains were salvaged on 26 July 1925 and scrapped.

Bartlett, 465 U.S. 463 (1984), was a Supreme Court Case involving Indian country jurisdiction in the United States, in which the court decided that opening up reservation lands for settlement by non-Indians does not constitute the intent to diminish reservation boundaries. Therefore, reservation boundaries would not be diminished unless specifically determined through legislation..  Background  The Cheyenne River Act of 1908 gave the Secretary of Interior power ‚Äúto sell and dispose of‚Äù of the Cheyenne River Sioux reservation to non-Indians for settlement. The profit of the sale was to go to the United States Treasury as a ‚Äúcredit‚Äù for the Indians to have tribal rights on the reservation (465 U.S. 463). In 1979, Sioux tribe member John Bartlett was charged by the State of South Dakota with attempted rape. The crime had occurred on the area of the reservation that had been opened to settlement in 1908 with Cheyenne River Act (465 U. S. 465). Bartlett pleaded guilty and was sentenced to ten years in a state penitentiary, but contended that his crime actually took place in Indian country because the Act did not reduce the reservation but instead only opened it to settlement, therefore the jurisdiction belonged to the tribe, not the state (465 U.S. 465).  Opinion of the Court  The Court recognized that large areas in the west had been set aside as Indian reservations in the late 19th century, and that later, individual allotments were designated to Indians, with the excess land being sold to non-Indians. The Cheyenne River Act was a piece of legislation that dealt specifically with the excess land from the Cheyenne Sioux Reservation, and has its own statutory language. Usually, States held jurisdiction over unallotted open lands when the Act declared that the area is no longer considered reservation land. Otherwise, federal, state, and tribal authorities share jurisdiction of the open area. The Court stated that designated reservation land remains a part of the reservation until Congress clearly diminishes its boundaries. The Court held that the Act only gives the Secretary of State permission to ‚Äúsell and dispose‚Äù of lands, not to diminish the reservation boundaries (465 U.S. 466). Therefore, the Cheyenne River Sioux reservation was not diminished by the Act and the area on which Bartlett committed his crime was within Indian country jurisdiction. The ruling in Solem v. Bartlett established three principles to measure Congress‚Äôs intent to diminish a reservation. First, only Congress has the power to diminish reservation boundaries. In Solem, it is stated that ‚Äúonce a block of land is set aside for an Indian reservation and no matter what happens to the title of the individual plots within the area, the entire block retains its reservation status until Congress explicitly states otherwise‚Äù.Campisi, Jack, and Laurence M. Hauptman, eds. The Oneida Indian Experience: Two Perspectives. 1st ed. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1988. Therefore, the allotment policy does not designate a change in reservation boundaries. It is also stated that the intent to diminish will not be lightly inferred by a federal court. Since only Congress has the power to diminish a reservation and the allotment policy never eliminated reservations, the language of any surplus land acts must specifically state the intent to diminish a reservation or make a blatant statement from which the intent to diminished is presumed. Other factors can also determine whether reservation lands have been reduced by an act, such as the legislative history. For example, subsequent treatment of the land by Congress can specify whether the land is still considered a part of the reservation or not. If the treatment of an area strongly suggests that Congress or other governmental groups view the reservation land as diminished, yet there is no specific statutory language deeming it so, it can still be considered reduced. However, when both the Act and the legislative history are unsuccessful in providing proof that supports the idea of diminishment, the court holds that the reservation is not diminished  Subsequent developments  The important precedents set in the decision, Solem v. Bartlett, were heavily relied upon later on to decide two other cases involving Indian country jurisdiction. In Hagen v. Utah, the court, using the factors determined in Solem, upheld that Congress had intentionally diminished tribal lands with surplus land acts in the Uintah Reservation.Canby Jr., William C. American Indian Law in a Nutshell. St. Paul: West Publishing Co., 2004. The court determined that the specific language in Hagen, which addressed that the excess lands ‚Äúbe restored to the public domain‚Äù clearly indicated that the land was not to remain reservation land as in Solem, but instead reduce the boundaries of the reservation. In another similar case, South Dakota v. Yankton Sioux Tribe, the court echoed similar sentiments, stating that Congress used clear statutory language to diminish the boundaries of the Yankton Sioux Reservation and that the agreement to pay for these lands further supported that they had been ceded through the statute. The tests of Solem as to whether Congress has property disestablished the reservation boundary, arose in Sharp v. Murphy, a case involving the reservations of the Five Civilized Tribes that cover most of the eastern half of the state of Oklahoma, as to whether to determine if a person accused of murder should be under jurisdiction of the state if the reservations were disestablished or the federal system otherwise. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit used Solem to find that Congress did not explicitly disestablish these reservations,. The decision of the Appeals Court was upheld by the United States Supreme in light of that courts judgement in McGirt v. Oklahoma (2020). This means that Patrick Murphy could be retried in federal court.

Taylor, Lang & Co. was the largest company outside this group, but was acquired in 1936. The individual units continued to trade under their own names until 1970, when they were rationalised into one company, Platt UK Ltd. In 1991, this company became Platt Saco Lowell. Origins and early history Taylor, Lang & Co. was established in April/May 1852, with a capital of ¬£600. The founders were mechanics in Oldham, but worked in their spare time in a co- op grocery shop where they talked over the idea of applying the cooperative approach to engineering. In January 1852 an industrial dispute (known as \\"The Great Lock Out\\") in the Manchester and Oldham district engineering industry led to them being thrown out of permanent employment (\\"locked out\\"). Consequently, twenty-three of these workmen came together and set up as cooperative machine makers (machinists). The original members were: :Books (Pattern Maker): James Taylor :Iron Turners: John Storrs, Samuel Booth, Henry England, William C.

These members were James Sutcliffe, Thomas Watson, Martin Scragg, James Uttley, Thomas Cheetham, Charles Rothwell and Jacob Marshall. Another original member, Samuel Mitchell, had died prior to 1859. As of 14 May 1872, Taylor, Lang & Co. became incorporated under the Companies Act of 1862.

This is typical of the scale of orders the company were receiving by that point. Edward Buckley One of the most significant figures in the history of Taylor, Lang & Co. was the mechanic and inventor Edward Buckley. The son of Stalybridge blacksmith Radcliffe Buckley, Edward was born on Brierley Street in the Castle Hall area of the town, on 13 April 1838. He was educated at Thomas Avison's 'People's School', and undertook apprenticeships as a grocer's assistant and wheelwright. He found his calling as a mechanic, learning the trade at Messrs. Broadbent's Machinists. Following a period working as a journeyman, Edward became involved with a newly established firm of machinists in nearby Dukinfield. He was offered the opportunity to eventually become a partner in the company, but the venture proved unsuccessful and was short-lived. Edward then joined Taylor, Lang & Co., who at that time made carding machines. When the firm stopped manufacturing this line, Edward entered the 'scutcher' (a beating-engine, used to bring floss and refuse silk to a downy condition) department, where he succeeded his supervisor (Thomas Rhodes) as the head of department. His passion and eye for innovation and inventions resulted in a series of design improvements and labour-saving combinations, including the self-acting mule headstock. These advances resulted in the firm's profit and international stature increasing rapidly; Edward was subsequently elected to a seat on the directorate in 1872. The biographer Samuel Hill described Edward Buckley as \\"somewhat reserved and quiet; in his dealings straight, and perhaps blunt.\\" Hill continued, \\"Having himself known the difficulties which face the aspiring working man, he needed no imitation to enlighten him as to the qualities of those who came beneath his supervision. Although his success had enriched him in a worldly sense, it made little difference in his bearing and domestic surroundings; pride and show were strangers to his composition.\\"Samuel Hill, Bygone Stalybridge, (1907), pp. 299‚Äì301. Edward was also involved in local politics, attaining the position of Town Councillor as a Conservative. Edward died during his term of office on 15 May 1894, having spent his final months struggling to overcome the death of his wife.

Tribal leaders and reservation police departments consider this epidemic the largest threat to public safety. They attribute to this particular type of drug, the higher rates of domestic violence, assaults, burglaries, and child abuse and neglect on reservations.http://www.bia.gov/bia_ojs.html Background Methamphetamine's eastward spread from California included most of Indian country. However, due to the nature of the substance, it has been created independently in criminal labs on tribal lands and surrounding areas, as well. As in the case of the Wind River Indian Reservation, Mexican drug cartels specifically targeted reservations due to their isolation and complicated drug laws. The United States federal government recognizes the inherent right of tribes, as \\"domestic dependent nations\\", to outlaw substances on their lands. For example, Montana legally allows the sale of alcohol as does the rest of the United States, but the Crow and Northern Cheyenne reservations in the state prohibit it. The jurisdictional issues between native and federal law created loopholes and opportunities for the cartels to begin business. Effects on Indian country  Crime Reports of crime have escalated since methamphetamine's introduction. FBI offices located in Indian country estimate that 40 to 50% of the violent crime cases they investigate involve the drug. The increase is not solely attributed to Native American users. Traffickers, criminal groups, and gang members commit crimes against other groups and Native Americans in order to continue their drug distribution. According to the United States Department of Justice, the crimes can be divided into three categories: personal crime, such as threats and intimidation; property crime, such as arson, theft, burglary, and vandalism; and violent crime, such as homicide, rape, and aggravated assault.

Like the earlier Power Jets W.1, the \\"trombone\\" configuration featured a simple double-sided centrifugal compressor, reverse-flow combustion chambers and an air-cooled axial-flow turbine section. Design and development In 1940 the Air Ministry placed a contract with the Gloster Aircraft Company for prototypes of a new twin-engined jet fighter aircraft to the requirement of F.9/40, this aircraft became the Gloster Meteor. At the same time, Power Jets was authorised to design a new engine that was intended to power the same aircraft.Smith 1946, p. 87. The W.2 was built under contract by the Rover Car Company in the early 1940s. Relations between Power Jets and Rover were somewhat strained and development of the W.2 was very slow. In late 1942, Rover agreed to exchange their jet engine factory at Barnoldswick, Lancashire for the Rolls-Royce Meteor tank engine factory in Nottingham, with no money changing hands. At the behest of the UK government, Rolls-Royce thereupon assumed control of the W.2 project, with Frank Whittle and his small team at Power Jets acting in an advisory capacity.Hooker 1984, Chapter 3. Together, they ironed out the problems with the W.2 and finally put the engine into mass production as the thrust Rolls-Royce Welland. These engines were installed in the Gloster Meteor F Mk1 and early F Mk3's and entered service in 1944. After initial suggestions in 1939 by the Engine Department of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), the latter's Pyestock Section experimented with the technique of injecting fuel into the engine's exhaust nozzle, later known as reheat, and this technique was further refined after Power Jets and the personnel from Pyestock had been amalgamated. Reheat was later flight trialled in the W.2/700 engines in a Meteor I. The technique increased the Meteor's speed by 30-40mph.https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1947/1947%20-%201359.html Variants Note: the Rover designations for engines produced at Barnoldswick were given a \\"B\\" prefix together with their own internal design number, e.g., \\"B.23\\". Later, after designs were transferred to Rolls-Royce (RR) an additional \\"R\\" was prefixed, changing the designation to \\"RB\\" to prevent possible confusion with US bomber designations, e.g., \\"RB.23\\".

Applications The following aircraft were used for test purposes only: * Gloster E.28/39 * F.9/40 * Vickers Wellington The W.2B/700 was to be used in the Miles M.52 supersonic research aircraft. In order to achieve the thrust required for supersonic flight, a version of the engine was developed using a turbine-driven \\"augmenter\\" ducted fan (an early form of turbofan). The NO.4 augmenter was mounted behind the engine, drawing fresh air through ducts surrounding the engine. Power was boosted even further by supplying the air to the world's first \\"reheat jetpipe\\" or afterburner which was actually a very early athodyd or ramjet. The hope was that this combination of the W.2/700, turbofan augmenter and re-heat/ramjet would produce the required power for the proposed 1,000 mph aircraft.Eric Brown 2012, The Miles M.52: Gateway to Supersonic Flight Engines on display *A preserved W.2/700 is on public display at the Farnborough Air Sciences Trust. *Another W.2/700 is part of the aero engine collection at Royal Air Force Museum Cosford. *A sectioned W.2/700 at Lutterworth Museum * W.2/500 at RAF museum London *A Rover W.2B/26 is on display at the Midland Air Museum.

History Father's Office was founded in 1953. From 1986 to 2000, under the ownership of Lou Moench, Father‚Äôs Office was influential in the rise of America‚Äôs craft brewing industry and the establishment of smoke-free bars in California. Moench initially sold two types of beers from Anchor Brewing Company and Sierra Nevada Brewing Company, and expanded the beer menu over the years to include more than 70 brands from California, Oregon and Washington. Selections would vary, depending on available stock and season. Looking back on when he purchased Father's Office in the late '80s, Moench said embracing craft beer came with a cost. \\"When I stopped selling Bud and put Widmer Hefeweizen on that tap handle, I got a reaction. I had to educate people.\\" Father's Office made headlines in 1991 when Moench decided to voluntarily make it California's first smoke-free bar. For Moench, taking action was a health issue for his employees. \\"Secondhand smoke kills some 53,000 people each year,‚Äù Moench would tell bar owners. \\"This is about caring for the health of your employees and customers who don't smoke,\\" he said. Seven years later, all other bar owners in California would eventually join him. In 1994, Gov. Pete Wilson signed a law banning smoking in the workplace. A temporary exemption was carved out for bars and casinos, but that ended on January 1, 1998. Father's Office was purchased in 2000 by owner and head chef Sang Yoon, who had cooked gourmet California cuisine at Michael's restaurant in Santa Monica, California when he surrendered the desire for his own establishment. He took over Father's Office and added his own touches. Yoon opened the bar's kitchen which had previously offered cheese plates and a list of local delivery options for patrons to bring in. The main attraction turned out to be the Office Burger, a patty of fine dry-aged beef topped with caramelized onions, Gruy√®re and Maytag cheeses, applewood-smoked bacon compote and arugula served on a soft roll. Sang Yoon is infamous for allowing no substitutions or alterations of any type to the food served at Father's Office, including no ketchup.

Biography  Son of Betty (n√©e Hargreave) and prominent Lancashire cotton industrialist, Thomas Ainsworth (1758‚Äì1831) and grandson of pioneer of chemical bleaching and founder of Halliwell bleach works, Peter Ainsworth (1713‚Äì1780). Thomas Ainsworth (1795‚Äì1841) was born in Bolton le Moors, Lancashire a textile- producing region in England. He married Jane Bower of West Retford, Nottinghamshire in 1820, and together they had 5 children. Thomas Ainsworth was a textile engineer who established synthetic bleach works in Almelo, Aalten and Enschede, eastern Netherlands and later founded the Twente Steam bleach works in Goor in 1832. He also established a textile school in Overijssel. His works brought economic prosperity to those regions of the Netherlands. When the cotton firm of Thomas Ainsworth's father went bankrupt, Thomas and his brother, Edward Ainsworth, moved with their families to France and later on to Belgium to work in the cotton industry. Later, in Belgium, Thomas worked in the blast furnace of John Cockerill in Seraing. When the Belgian Revolution started Thomas moved to the Netherlands and lived for more than a year in the Zaanstreek before he got the idea to go to Elberfeld, Germany to work with chemical aspects of the textile industry which he was very much interested in as later found in a book that he worked for Van Gelder, Schouten & Co where they made bleached and colored paper. On his way towards Germany he passed Twente, situated in the east of the Netherlands. This was a region that was of particular interest for the Dutch government for a textile company and therefore Thomas was the chosen man. He also went to textile companies Aalten and Hofkes situated in Almelo to build machines for bleaching. , a Belgian textile entrepreneur who came to live in Twente after 1830 wanted the expertise of Thomas Ainsworth and later on in 1832 the secretary of the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, Willem de Clercq talked about their own textile industry in Twente upon which Nijverdal was founded with the coming of the Royal Steam Weaving Mill (KSW). Ainsworth died suddenly in 1841. His grave can still be found in the town of Goor.

History In 1914 Reverend Kaiseki Kodama arrived in Kona and held services at the former Hanato Store which was located across the street from the present temple. He walked around the entire island twice in order to collect donations to build a temple. In 1915, the first temple, a small thatched structure was built a few hundred yards above and to the north of the present site. It was named Hakuhozan Daifukuji (\\"Temple of Great Happiness on White Mountain Peak\\") by the Zen abbots of S≈çt≈ç temples Eihei-ji and S≈çji-ji in Japan. The site is in the area known as Honalo, Hawaii in the Kona district on the western slopes of Mauna Loa. Although \\"white mountain\\" is a translation in the Hawaiian language of the name Mauna Kea, the other main peak on the island of Hawaii, snow often covers Mauna Loa in winter as well. Reverend Kaiseki Kodama arrived in 1918 and started construction of the current temple in 1920. On May 27, 1921, a Buddha image was enshrined in the main hall in a dedication ceremony. The temple is a blend of traditional Japanese architectural forms adapted to local Hawaiian building methods. It was designed by first-generation immigrant (Issei) Yoshisuke Sasaki who owned a store nearby in Keauhou, and constructed by head carpenter Teruyoshi Ikenouchi and others. Over the next few years living quarters were added, and a Japanese language school added in 1926, under the third minister, Giko Kanbara and his wife Shigeko Kanbara. The roof has the traditional Japanese temple style of decorated gable roof called Irimoya. Enshrined in the main hall is an image of the historical Gautama Buddha. To the right is the seated figure of D≈çgen and to the left is Keizan, founders of the S≈çt≈ç Zen tradition. An alcove to the right of the main altar has two more figures: Bodai Daruma Daishi (Bodhidharma), who carried teachings from India to China, and Daigen Shuri Bosatsu, another bodhisattva. The Kannon Hall was added in 1937 with an image of Kannon (Guan Yin), the bodhisattva of great compassion, sculpted by Sosaku Miki. To her right and left are 33 smaller Kannon statuettes, representing various manifestations of compassion. A small cemetery lies uphill from the temple. Although the interior has been remodeled at various times, the original sculptures (including one from 1915) and acacia koa wood altar remain. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 the temple was shut down. Reverend Hozui Nakayama, the minister at the temple was arrested and sent to the mainland as part of the Japanese American internment. The US Army occupied the site, but allowed lay members of the community to hold funeral services. After World War II, the temple was re-opened in February 1946. A minister's house was added about 1950. A small shrine on the steps leading to the temple with a statue of Jiz≈ç (Ksitigarbha) dedicated on May 25, 1961.

The route was to begin at the state line near Paulsboro, New Jersey, heading eastward as a freeway through several southern New Jersey communities and providing access from New Jersey Route 42 to the Delaware River. The plans for the original freeway date back to 1930, when the original studies and requests were decided on by the New Jersey State Legislature. Plans soon followed in Pennsylvania, but after three years of receiving approval, the Gloucester County Tunnel experienced several setbacks. In 1938, the New Jersey State Legislature designated the State Highway Route 44-T designation, as a suffixed tunnel spur of New Jersey Route 44. By the 1953 renumbering, Route 44-T was already repealed and decommissioned while the tunnel was never constructed by the Gloucester County Tunnel Commission.  Route description  State Highway Route 44-T was designated to start at the Pennsylvania state line near the community of Paulsboro along the Gloucester County Tunnel. Route 44-T would then head eastward along the tunnel, coming ashore in Paulsboro and onto lands in New Jersey. In New Jersey, the highway was proposed to head eastward along the Pine Barrens region as a freeway, interchanging with State Highway Route 44 (also designated U.S. Route 130) in Paulsboro. From there, it would head to the northeast, interchanging with State Highway Route 45 further east. From that point, the highway was to continue eastward, interchanging with State Highway Route 47 in Blackwood. After interchanging with State Highway Route 41 in Blackwood, Route 44-T would head eastward, interchanging with State Highway Route 42 (also designated U.S. Route 322) in Williamstown, where the designation would terminate.  History  Route 44-T and the Gloucester County Tunnel were proposed as an alternate to the Ben Franklin Bridge, seen in this photo at sunrise The plans for a tunnel across the Delaware River from Gloucester County, New Jersey to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania date back to 1930, when the state of New Jersey set aside funding to study the feasibility of such an accomplishment. The origination for the tunnel were by local businessmen and officials who suggested another crossing across the Delaware after the success with the Ben Franklin Bridge. This coincided with plans in 1930 to build new tunnels from New York to New Jersey and vice versa with Pennsylvania. The states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania continued further interest, with Governor Gifford Pinchot signing a preliminary bill at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on December 23, 1933 for a new tunnel. The tunnel was proposed to be south of the Ben Franklin Bridge in Camden. In May 1935, the New Jersey State Highway Department started purchasing lands around the proposed tunnel location in Paulsboro for the construction, which as proposed would take about two years to construct and provide 4,000 jobs to men in the region. In 1937, the Gloucester County Tunnel Commission was authorized by legislature to help foresee ownership and construction of the new tunnel, which had yet to be constructed. After another year of financial setbacks, the permits to the construct the Gloucester County Tunnel was approved once again, despite protests by officials in Philadelphia. The project at this point would cost $17.5 million (1938 USD) to construct. The Pennsylvania State Legislature in Harrisburg performed the same actions a year later. As a result of the signing of the roadway in New Jersey, the New Jersey State Legislature set forth the proposed designation of State Highway Route 44-T as the approaches to the tunnel and a freeway built off the tunnel. The designation came as a spur of U.S. Route 130/State Highway Route 44 in Paulsboro.ROUTE NO. 44T.

It replaced an earlier station on York Road which had opened on 1 May 1876. After the construction of a double track line to allow through trains from Leeds to Harrogate via Wetherby, York Road station closed and Wetherby's new station opened in 1902. It closed to passenger traffic on 6 January 1964 and to goods on 4 April 1966 under the Beeching axe. Background The rail network in Leeds showing the LNER Cross Gates to Wetherby and Harrogate to Church Fenton Lines Wetherby declined as a coaching town after the opening of York Road station on the Harrogate to Church Fenton Line by the York and North Midland Railway on 10 August 1847. Economic damage was caused by the railway as no rail link was made between Wetherby and the major trading and commercial centre, Leeds. A railway line to Leeds became one of the first campaigns of the Wetherby News. Two Wetherby businessmen; Henry Crossley and James Coates exerted pressures on the railway companies. The first proposal for a railway between Wetherby and Leeds was put forward in 1863 by the London and North Western Railway from its terminus in Leeds to Wetherby, the Vale of York to Hartlepool. The plan never came to fruition. It forced the North Eastern Railway Company to propose a railway line to prevent its rival encroaching into its heartland. In 1866 NER was given powers to build a line between Leeds and Wetherby although the route was undecided. Crossley and Coates again campaigned to prevent the line being cancelled. The branch between Wetherby (York Road) and opened on 1 May 1876 as a single-track line linking the Leeds to Selby and Harrogate to Church Fenton lines. The junction at Wetherby only faced towards which meant that the Cross Gates branch was little used for Harrogate services. Improvements were made between 1897 and 1902 which saw the line doubled and a south-to-west curve installed to form a triangular junction facing Wetherby. Its opening led to residential development in the town. A new station to replace York Road station was opened at Linton Road near Wetherby South Junction at the southern apex of the new junction on 1 July 1902. The works were part of a plan to open the Leeds-Wetherby-Harrogate-Northallerton route for express services. Station The ticket booths after the station was closed The station was similar in appearance to Menston station, with its stone buildings on one platform and an iron footbridge. The front originally had a sheltered entrance. At the eastern end of the station was the Devils Toenail Junction, where the line forked to Harrogate or Church Fenton making up one corner of the triangular junction. The junction was in a cutting with walls of buff- coloured Magnesian Limestone in which fossils can be found. It is still known to some locals as the Devils Toenail. In 1932, there were four Leeds-Wetherby- Harrogate weekday services and twelve stopping services to Wetherby, with most services continuing to and Church Fenton. For a while a - route ran through Wetherby station.Sustrans Route 66 \\"Harland Way\\" leaflet The line went into decline under British Railways despite dieselisation in 1958, eliminating the problem of trackside fires. By the end of 1963, Leeds to Wetherby services had been reduced to four on weekdays together with an extra service on Saturdays. At the same time, long-distance passenger services had increased, with two overnight services being transferred to the line in 1959 and during 1961‚Äì1963 two to Liverpool diesel expresses each way used the route. Closure The site of Wetherby (Linton Road) railway station in 2009 Location of railway infrastructure in Wetherby In March 1963, the Beeching report was published which called for the withdrawal of passenger services on the Leeds-Wetherby- Harrogate and Church Fenton-Wetherby lines and the closure of their stations. The lines were the first to be closed under Beeching's plans. A headline, \\"First Lamb to the Beeching slaughter\\", mentioned that \\"No Regular Passengers Object at Inquiry\\", which was the case for only the Church Fenton line. A decision was reached on 24 October 1963 after a three-month enquiry. The axe fell on 6 January 1964 for passenger services on both lines, although goods traffic continued on the Cross Gates line for a further four months until 27 April 1964. Goods services on the Church Fenton survived until 4 April 1966. At the time of the Beeching enquiry, there were no more than eight passengers on the one train a day between Church Fenton and Harrogate via Wetherby and no regular passengers. The route had originally been of strategic significance, linking the East Coast Main Line with Harrogate. After the line via Knaresborough was built, most passengers to and from Harrogate no longer used this route. There were more passengers on the Leeds to Wetherby route but only six southbound and four northbound trains stopped each day and competition from bus services made passenger numbers unsustainable despite the increase in commuters living in Wetherby. All stations were manned, as were 16 signal boxes and three level crossings requiring 35 staff, the line had steep gradients requiring banking engines and it was considered uneconomical having an operating cost of ¬£57,000 pa compared to receipts of ¬£9,000. Through freight traffic via Wetherby was costly and slow because of steep gradients and became uneconomical following the quadrupling of the track between and in 1959. The original twenty freight paths between Harrogate and Wetherby (in each direction) fell to five by 1960. Local freight consisted largely of house coal, the use of which was declining. Post-closure By 1966 the track had been lifted and the waiting rooms on the Harrogate bound platform were demolished. By the 1970s the tracks had been filled to platform level but the main station buildings remained in a dilapidated state. In 1971 the site was used for the filming of an episode of Follyfoot, the buildings were demolished shortly afterwards. Plans to relieve road congestion in the town centre and on the A58 and A661 roads by converting the disused railway lines into relief roads never came to fruition. The snow-covered undeveloped site in January 2013 The pedestrian entrance remains near the bridge on the A661, with the original gate and nameboard brackets. The bridges on either side of the station bear a notice issued by British Rail in 1987 stating that the trackbed still belongs to British Rail. Line side markers remain dotted about the old trackbed. Following closure, the station site was used as a car park. Part of the trackbed between Wetherby and Leeds has been used for housing development. Sustrans National Cycle Network routes 66 and 67 use part of the track bed from Wetherby to Priest Hill which opened in 1992, and the \\"devil's toenail\\" triangle, which was completed by the Wetherby and District Lions Club in summer 1993. In 2003 Leeds City Council continued the cycle track to Thorp Arch. The track is part of a proposed link between Harrogate and York. It passes through open farmland and deep wooded cuttings that provide a range of habitats for wildlife and pass some sites of industrial archaeology.Sustrans leaflet The Cross Gates to Wetherby line is protected as far as Scholes in Leeds City Council's Unitary Development Plan, although no project to re-open the line has emerged. A small stretch has been built on in Linton and Bardsey so reconstruction would be expensive and require either the demolition of properties or re-routing. The bridge over the River Wharfe at Collingham has been demolished. Campaign for Better Transport support the re-opening of the routes from Wetherby to Harrogate and Leeds.

It was submerged in 1957 by the uppermost waters of Lake Celilo, the reservoir of The Dalles Dam. * John Day Rapids: Located between river mile 216 and 218, near the mouth of the John Day River and consisting of two main rapids: the Lower John Day Rapids, at , and the Upper John Day Rapids, at . The Army Corps of Engineers made efforts to improve navigation at the rapids. In 1911 a \\"large reef\\" was removed from the \\"middle rapids\\". The rapids were submerged in 1971 under Lake Umatilla, the reservoir of John Day Dam. * Indian Rapids: Located at river mile 220, just above the mouth of the John Day River, at . It was small and not a significant hazard. When David Thompson visited the rapids on August 2, 1811, he named it Muscle Rapids due to the many shells he found there. The rapids were submerged in 1971 under Lake Umatilla, the reservoir of John Day Dam. * Squally Hook Rapids: Located at river mile 223, a few miles above the mouth of the John Day River, at . It was not a major hazard although one commentator described it as \\"short sharp and savage\\". In 1912 the Army Corps of Engineers improved navigation by drilling and blasting rocks at the rapids. The rapids were submerged in 1971 under Lake Umatilla, the reservoir of John Day Dam. * Rock Creek Rapids: Located near the mouth of Rock Creek, approximately river mile 227 to 228. Described as \\"rough and rowdy\\" but not particularly hazardous. * Blalock Rapids: A very minor rapid, probably located near the railway siding of Blalock at the mouth of Blalock Canyon, approximate river mile 233. It was submerged in 1971 under Lake Umatilla, the reservoir of John Day Dam. * Owyhee Rapids: A very minor rapid located at river mile 240, , near Arlington, Oregon.

In 1912 the Army Corps of Engineers improved navigation at the rapids by removing \\"two large reefs\\" and several smaller ones from the center of the channel, which had been a hazard during low-water. The rapids were submerged in 1971 under Lake Umatilla, the reservoir of John Day Dam. * Umatilla Rapids: A significant rapid, located at what is now McNary Dam, river mile 292, . There were at least three \\"riffles\\", with the third one downstream being the main one. The total length was somewhat over . During the low-water seasons, about November to March, Umatilla Rapids became a barrier to steamboat navigation in the late 19th century. The lesser rapids below Umatilla also became more hazardous; larger boats might not even be able to reach Umatilla Rapids during low-water. During high-water large boats could operate from Celilo Falls upriver as far as Lewiston, Idaho on the Snake River. The low-water season effectively suspended river navigation above Umatilla Rapids and on the Snake River. In 1912 the Army Corps of Engineers described the Upper Umatilla Rapids as having two channels. The north channel, known as the low-water channel, was \\"narrow and tortuous at low water, but has been the only available channel\\". The south channel, known as the high-water channel, was used only during the high and medium stages of the river. In 1891 rocks were blasted in Umatilla Rapids to create a passage for steamboats during low water. Additional work to improve navigation was done in 1910 and 1911. The rapids were submerged in 1954 under Lake Wallula, the reservoir of McNary Dam. Parts of the dam were built on top of the lower portion of the rapids. In 1805 the Lewis and Clark Expedition gave the name Musselshell Rapids due to the numerous mussels.Washington Place Names , Tacoma Public Library * Homley Rapids (Homly Rapids): A very minor rapid located about below Pasco, Washington. In 1911 the Army Corps of Engineers described \\"Homly Rapids\\" as \\"the shoalest on the Columbia between Celilo and the mouth of the Snake River\\", and that the river was divided by numerous islands, with the main channel passing between \\"islands Nos. 4 and 5\\". The Corps made efforts to improve navigation by removing obstructions from the main channel and by building \\"wing dams\\" to force more water into the main channel. The rapids were submerged in 1954 under Lake Wallula, the reservoir of McNary Dam. * Bull Run Rapids: A very minor rapid located a few miles below Wallula Gap. Snake River to Bridgeport The 70 mile stretch between Priest Rapids and the mouth of the Snake River (the Hanford Reach) \\"has the slowest current of any part of the Columbia above The Dalles\\".Down the Columbia, p. 320 * Coyote Rapids: A minor rapid located at river mile 382, , next to the \\"100 Area\\" of the Hanford Site, which is home to Hanford's B Reactor (now a National Historic Landmark) and N-Reactor, and others including the C, D, DR, KE, and KW reactors. As part of the Hanford Reach of the Columbia, Coyote Rapids still exist. Priest Rapids. * Priest Rapids: A series of seven rapids located approximately between river mile 406 and 397 (an 1893 report says river miles 409.5 to 421), near Mattawa, Desert Aire, and the Yakima Training Center. The USGS provides a single coordinate point, . The river dropped over the entire length, with a drop of occurring in one short section. In 1888 two steamboats were built at Pasco specifically for the purpose of making it through Priest Rapids and Rock Island Rapids to Wenatchee. The first of the two failed. The second, smaller one, City of Ellensburg, under Captain William Polk Gray, succeeded in passing through Priest Rapids and the more difficult Rock Island Rapids. Later, the sister boat, Thomas L. Nixon, also succeeded in ascending both rapids and reaching Wenatchee. In 1959 the rapids were submerged under Priest Rapids Lake, the reservoir of Priest Rapids Dam. * Cabinet Rapids: Located at river mile 448, at the mouth of Moses Coulee, . The river fell about over a length of about . In 1963 the rapids were submerged under Lake Wanapum, the reservoir of Wanapum Dam. * Nixon Rapids: Located at river mile 451.5, a few miles below Rock Island Dam; . The rapids are submerged in Lake Wanapum, the reservoir of Wanapum Dam. * Rock Island Rapids: Located at approximately river mile 454, near Rock Island Dam and Rock Island, and a few miles upriver from Cabinet Rapids; . The rapids were over long. Local native people called them Squah-ah- shee. They were given their present name in 1881 by Lieutenant Thomas W. Symons, who named them for Rock Island, a large rock in the river below Wenatchee, around which the water flowed swift and roughly. The two channels around Rock Island were full of rocks and other obstructions, and there was a \\"great reef\\" a short distance above the head of the island, with large bars of gravel, \\"nearly choking the channel at low water\\". The river fell over a distance of at low-water. In 1933 the rapids were submerged in Rock Island Pool, the reservoir of Rock Island Dam. At least two steamboats were wrecked at the rapids. The Selkirk wrecked at Rock Island Rapids on May 15, 1906 (see Shipwrecks of the inland Columbia River). In 1887 a steamboat tried and failed to ascend the Rock Island Rapids. In 1888 two steamboats were built at Pasco specifically for the purpose of making it through Priest Rapids and Rock Island Rapids to Wenatchee. The first of the two failed. The second, smaller one, City of Ellensburg, under Captain William Polk Gray, succeeded in passing through Priest Rapids and the more difficult Rock Island Rapids. Later, the sister boat, Thomas L. Nixon, also succeeded in ascending both rapids and reaching Wenatchee. * Entiat Rapids: Located between the mouth of the Entiat River and Orondo, at approximately . The rapids are submerged in Lake Entiat, the reservoir of Rocky Reach Dam. * Methow Rapids: Located at river mile 523, at the mouth of the Methow River near Pateros; . In 1967 the rapids were submerged in Lake Pateros, the reservoir of Wells Dam. Bridgeport to Canada‚ÄìUS border The portion of the river between Monaghan Rapids and Foster Creek Rapids was regarded as particularly hazardous. An 1893 report by the Army Corps of Engineers described the river from Monaghan Rapids to the foot of Foster Creek Rapids as \\"very swift and studded with rocks, and taken all in all will be found an extremely hard and dangerous if not absolutely impassable portion of the river to navigate\\". Over the from Monaghan to Foster Creek the river fell at low-water. Over the between Mah-kin Rapids and a point three miles below Parson Rapids the river fell at low water. The portion from White Cap Rapids to Eagle Rapids was once known as \\"Nespilem Canyon\\". The Corps' 1893 report said that over the worst stretch the river fell at low-water and at high-water, and that the speed of the current at low-water was about . On the possibility of navigation the Corps was pessimistic: \\"The fall of the river here is so great that it is certain that no system of rock removal could make the river sufficiently navigable to justify the danger and risk necessarily incurred in running boats on it.\\" * Reef Rapids: Located at river mile 544, between Bridgeport and Chief Joseph Dam; . It was submerged in 1967 by Lake Pateros, the reservoir of Wells Dam. * Foster Creek Rapids: Located at river mile 547-546, just above Chief Joseph Dam and Bridgeport. About a mile long,Down the Columbia, p. 274 the rapids are submerged in Rufus Woods Lake, the reservoir of Chief Joseph Dam. An 1893 report by the United States War Department described Foster Creek Rapids as \\"among the worst rapids on the river\\", and being about long, including Reef Rapids. Over this length the river fell during low water and at high water. In 1911 and 1912 efforts were made by the Army Corps of Engineers to improve navigation by blasting submerged rocks and reefs from Reef Rapids through Foster Creek Rapids and upriver to \\"Kalichen Rock\\" (Eagle Rapids). * Eagle Rapids (also called Whirlpool Rapids and Kalichen Falls): Located at river mile 555, just below Box Canyon; . Submerged in Rufus Woods Lake, the reservoir of Chief Joseph Dam. Upper Long Rapids. * Long Rapids: Located at river mile 557, just above Box Canyon; . Submerged in Rufus Woods Lake, the reservoir of Chief Joseph Dam. * White Cap Rapids: Located at river mile 558.5, between Gaviota Bend and Box Canyon; . Submerged in Rufus Woods Lake, the reservoir of Chief Joseph Dam. Lewis R. Freeman described White Cap Rapids as a narrow, straight, and steep channel \\"heavily littered with boulders and fanged with outcropping bedrock\\", with a \\"mad tumble of wallowing waters\\", somewhat similar to Gordon Rapids in the Big Bend region, but rougher.Down the Columbia, p. 275 * Parson Rapids: Located at river mile 566, at Tombstone Rocks, a few miles below Goose Flats; . Submerged in Rufus Woods Lake, the reservoir of Chief Joseph Dam. *Granite Rapids: Located at river mile 570, south of Saddle Horse Flat; . Submerged in Rufus Woods Lake, the reservoir of Chief Joseph Dam. * Mah-kin Rapids (also Mahkin): Located at river mile 572.5, at the head of Nespelem Canyon;.

Submerged in Rufus Woods Lake, the reservoir of Chief Joseph Dam. The name \\"equilibrium\\" was given by Symons because there was a rock in the rapids that rolled back and forth in the current. * Monaghan Rapids (Moneghan's Rapids, Buckley's Rapids): Located at river mile 587, just below an island called Buckley Bar.; . The name was given in 1881 by Lieutenant Thomas W. Symons, in honor of James Monaghan, who had encountered difficulties at the rapids in 1879-1880 attempting to bring rafts of supplies downriver to a military camp on the Okanogan River. Submerged in Rufus Woods Lake, the reservoir of Chief Joseph Dam. *Hell Gate: A gorge and rapids located at river mile 619, at the mouth of Hell Gate Canyon, upriver of Grand Coulee Dam; . Hellgate Island is located in Hell Gate Canyon. The rapids were submerged in 1942 under Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake, the reservoir of Grand Coulee Dam. * Spokane Rapids: Located at the mouth of the Spokane River, at Columbia river mile 640.Report of an examination of the upper Columbia River, p. 172 Submerged in 1942 under Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake, the reservoir of Grand Coulee Dam. * Turtle Rapids: A minor rapid located approximately at river mile 670, near Bissell, above Stray Dog Canyon.Report of an examination of the upper Columbia River, p. 168 The name comes from a number of rock outcroppings that resembled turtle backs.Down the Columbia, p. 224 * Rickey Rapids (also called Grand Rapids): These fairly hazardous rapids were located at river mile 697, south of the Colville River and Kettle Falls; . The rapids were dangerous enough that even small craft typically portaged around them. In 1826 they were given the name \\"Thompson Rapids\\" by David Douglas in honor of David Thompson of the North West Company. The name \\"Rickey\\" was given by John Rickey, a man who operated a store near the rapids. The name \\"Grand Rapids was commonly used as late as 1882. Today the rapids are submerged in Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake, the reservoir of Grand Coulee Dam. Kettle Falls. * Kettle Falls: Located at river mile 704.5, about two miles below the mouth of the Kettle River and five miles above the mouth of the Colville River, near the city of Kettle Falls; . Submerged in Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake, the reservoir of Grand Coulee Dam. * Little Dalles: Located at river mile 729, six miles downriver of Northport; . The river narrowed to at the head of the Little Dalles, then widened somewhat over a length of at least . Boat navigation through the Little Dalles was not difficult at low water, but during the high water season the drop increased to , making it a major hazard. The Little Dalles presented the primary obstacle to navigation on the upper river into Canada. The river was constricted between massive stone cliffs. The first official use of the name \\"Little Dalles\\" appears to come from the 1881 report of Lieutenant Symons, although it is likely the name was informally used long before. In an 1893 report Symons described the Little Dalles at low-water as \\"placid\\", but at high-water as \\"a seething, whirling torrent, impelled forward by a 16-foot head\\". He recommended ways to improve navigation during low-water. To improve navigation during high-water would require extensive work and would still be hazardous. He wrote, \\"Trees and logs 60 or 70 feet in length disappear in Little Dalles at high water; they go right down on end and do not reappear\\". In 1942 the rapids were submerged in Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake, the reservoir of Grand Coulee Dam. * Pingstone Rapids: Located above the mouth of the Kettle River, at approximately . The rapids are submerged in Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake, the reservoir of Grand Coulee Dam.

About long, the rapids are mild.Down the Columbia p. 197 * Tincup Rapids (formerly called Kootenay Rapids): A pair of rapids, called Upper and Lower, or Big and Little Tincup Rapids, located at Castlegar, just above the mouth of the Kootenay River; . The river narrows to at the foot of the lower rapid. For steamboats, the rapids were a navigation hazard during low water in autumn and winter. In the 1890s efforts were made to improve the channel by blasting rocks in the river. The rapids were noted as a \\"strong rapid\\" by David Thompson in his journal entry of September 6, 1811. During the 19th century Tincup Rapids was called Kootenay Rapids, and what is today called Kootenay Rapids was called Tincup Rapids. Sometime before 1916 the nomenclature was reversed. * The Narrows: Located between Upper Arrow Lake and Lower Arrow Lake, where the Columbia's water flowed swiftly as a river for about ; centered at . The lower, southern end of The Narrows, where the river emptied into Lower Arrow Lake, was located at Burton near Cariboo Creek, . The upper, northern end, where Upper Arrow Lake emptied into The Narrows, was located at West Demars near McDonald Creek, . The name of the lakes comes from \\"Arrow Rock\\", a pinnacle located along The Narrows. After the Hugh Keenleyside Dam was built in 1968 the two Arrow Lakes merged and The Narrows were submerged. Revelstoke to Mica Dam * Big Eddy: A whirlpool located at the sharp river bend just above downtown Revelstoke. and topographic maps The locality of Revelstoke was first known as \\"The Eddy\\" because of a large swirl in the river which had eroded the right bank of the Columbia here. * Steamboat Rapids: Located just north of downtown Revelstoke, about below Revelstoke Dam; . and topographic maps * Little Dalles Canyon: Located just north of Revelstoke; . Revelstoke Dam and the southern end of its reservoir Lake Revelstoke are in the canyon.

The rapids were submerged by Lake Revelstoke. * Priest Rapids: Located just south (downriver) from Dalles des Morts and about north (upriver) of the mouth of Downie Creek; . The rapids were submerged in Lake Revelstoke in 1984. The name comes from the drowning deaths of two French-Canadian priests at the rapids. Priest Rapids was reputed to be the fastest rapids of the Columbia River, with a current reckoned to be over .Down the Columbia, pp. 180-182 * Dalles des Morts (Death Rapids): One of the most hazardous rapids of the Columbia River, located just above Priest Rapids and about north of the mouth of Downie Creek; . The name dates to 1817 when seven voyageurs wrecked at the rapids and tried to walk to Spokane House, over away. Only one survived. A number of other fatal accidents occurred at the rapids, including the drowning of twelve people in 1838. Today the rapids are submerged in Lake Revelstoke, the reservoir of Revelstoke Dam. * Rock Slide Rapids: Located about downriver of the foot of Twelve Mile Rapids. Lewis Freeman described Rock Slide Rapids as the narrowest point of the entire Columbia River below Windermere Lake, with a channel width averaging . The river rushed through the narrows and poured into a \\"cauldron-like eddy\\", then into another narrow chute to form the Dalles des Morts.Down the Columbia pp. 172-173 Today the rapids are submerged in Lake Revelstoke, the reservoir of Revelstoke Dam. * Twelve Mile Rapids: Located just upriver of Dalles des Morts, .

The rapids were submerged by Lake Revelstoke. Mica Dam to source at Columbia Lake * Twenty-One-Mile Rapids: Lewis Freeman used the name Twenty-One-Mile Rapids for the series of rapids between the outlet of Kinbasket Lake (before its enlargement by Mica Dam) to the mouth of the Canoe River, which was about in length. Twenty-One-Mile Rapids in this sense included Redrock Canyon Rapids, Yellow Creek Rapids, Weasel Rapids, Mink Rapids, and Boulder Rapids. He also speculated that Twenty-One-Mile Rapids was \\"one of the longest, if not the longest, successfion of practically unbroken riffles on any of the great rivers of the world. Over the first the tail of one rapids generally ran right into the head of the next. The final contained less white water but still had a rapid current with many swirls and whirlpools. Throughout the series of rapids the river was closely constrained by canyons with no camping places along the way, thus one was compelled to run through the whole series in a single day.Down the Columbia, pp. 141, 144-145 Lewis Freeman, in his 1921 account, reports a new, powerful rapid at the end of Twenty-One-Mile Rapids. His guide, Blackmore, claimed there had previously been no major rapid between Yellow Creek and Death Rapids, and that this new rapid had been created by a large landslide during the spring before their journey. Freeman describes this new rapids as located directly upriver from \\"Red Canyon\\".Down the Columbia, pp. 151-157 * Redrock Canyon Rapids: Located near Redrock Harbour near the northernmost Big Bend of the Columbia River, southeast of Wood River, about downriver from Yellow Creek, and approximately upriver from Mica Dam; .

The Goods Shed remains and is situated off York Road in a small industrial estate and is a dance venue. The Harrogate to Church Fenton Line was augmented by the Cross Gates to Wetherby Line, which was opened on 1 May 1876. After construction of a double track allowing through trains from Leeds to Harrogate via Wetherby, the York Road station closed for passengers and Wetherby's new station was opened in 1902 on Linton Road. This station remained operational as a goods station until closure under the Beeching axe in 1964. History The locations of railway infrastructure in Wetherby Until the opening of the Church Fenton to Harrogate Line which brought the railway to Wetherby, the nearest station was at Bolton Percy to which a daily coach operated from the Angel public house. The opening of these North-South railways caused Wetherby economic harm as it took much traffic off the Great North Road; the 1839 toll income from the Ferrybridge-Wetherby-Boroughbridge turnpike was ¬£2,400, but within a few years it had fallen to ¬£1,400. The Church Fenton-Tadcaster-Wetherby-Spofforth section of the line opened on 10 August 1847, with the final stretch to Harrogate opening on 20 July 1848. The station which was located on York Road was somewhat to the North East of the town at the time and consequently saw less usage than it might have otherwise and employed fewer people; in the 1851 census a porter was listed while by 1871 a porter and station master were both listed. Comparably the station on Linton Road in its heyday had around seven staff. To compensate for the distance from the town by the 1850s every train arriving in Wetherby was met by a coach from the Angel. The introduction of the rail service further eroded the towns main coaching inns (the Swan and Talbot and the Angel) as local transport centres. Despite this the number of inns in the town remained almost unchanged from sixteen in 1837 to fifteen by 1861. Despite this, many innkeepers were forced to seek supplementary incomes including an agricultural machinist (Blacksmiths Arms), carrier (Crown Inn), wheelwright (Fox Inn), purveyor of wines and spirits (Red Lion), farmer (White Hart) and a blacksmith (White Horse). The coming of the railway dented Wetherby's importance as a coaching town greatly. What's more, the town wasn't to get the crucial rail link to Leeds until 1876.  Development plans  In the late 1960s it was evident that Wetherby was going to grow. In 1965 it was estimated that by 1981, the town's population would double to 12,000 and this estimate proved quite accurate. There were ambitious plans to relieve growing congestion through the town centre and on the A58 and A661 by converting the disused railways into relief roads. These suggestions never came to fruition.

Goldberg (born 1973) is an American theatre director and the current Artistic Director of the National Playwrights Conference at The Eugene O'Neill Theater Center. Under Goldberg's tenure, The O'Neill was awarded the 2010 Regional Theatre Tony Award, the first play development and education organization to receive this honor. Goldberg is the first woman to run the Playwrights Conference and was named Artistic Director when she was just 31 years old.  Life and career Goldberg was born in Michigan and her mother was a middle-school English teacher. She spent her youth training to be a professional tennis player, but her athletic career was cut short when she contracted lyme disease in 1989, the summer before her junior year in high school. Though Goldberg still managed to win the state championship that year, she decided to skip tennis camp the following summer, and went instead to an acting conservatory. The experience of the program changed her career focus, and when she went off to the University of Michigan after graduation, she chose to study theatre and comparative literature. After earning a BA, with honors, Goldberg continued her theatre education at the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television where she completed an MFA in Directing in 1998. After receiving her degree, Goldberg served for five seasons as Artistic Associate at Arena Stage in Washington, D. C., where her directing credits include The Goat, or Who is Sylvia?, Proof, Book of Days, and On the Jump. She led \\"Downstairs in the Old Vat Room,\\" Arena's artistic initiative dedicated to the development of new American plays, since its inception. Other than the theater's founder, Zelda Fichandler, she is the youngest associate to have directed for the company in its 50-year history, making her main stage debut at the age of 26 with the company's revival of K2 in celebration of the company's 50th anniversary. Goldberg has also directed in various new play development programs across the country, including work with New York Stage and Film, New Dramatists, The Women's Project, Arielle Tepper Productions, Hartford Stage, The Mark Taper Forum, Portland Center Stage, Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company, Ojai Playwrights Conference, the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and over 30 readings and workshops for Arena Stage. At The O'Neill, Goldberg has developed more than forty projects for the stage and many have gone on to great acclaim in New York and around the country. Included in that group is the 2010 Susan Smith Blackburn Prize Winner (Julia Cho's The Language Archive), two American Theatre Critics Association Citation Award Winning Plays (Lee Blessing's Great Falls and Deborah Zoe Laufer's End Days) and 2009 Pulitzer Prize Winner for Drama (Lynn Nottage's Ruined), written in part during Lynn's residency at the O'Neill in the summer of 2006. In the 2007-2008 season, nine projects developed during Goldberg's tenure saw their world premieres at theaters across the country. Other critically acclaimed work developed at the O'Neill during Goldberg's tenure includes Adam Bock's The Receptionist, Rebecca Gilman's The Crown You're in With, Jason Grote's 1001 and Julia Cho's Durango. Goldberg is also the Creative Advisor for the Tony nominated Rock of Ages on Broadway. Her recent directing credits include Rebecca Gilman's Dollhouse (Guthrie Theater), The Crown You're in With (Goodman Theatre), the world premiere of Deathbed (McGinn/Cazale-NYC), Master Class (Paper Mill Playhouse), Durango (Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park), DOUBT (co-production with Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park and Actors Theater of Louisville), Third, The Sweetest Swing in Baseball, The Clean House, Living Out (Denver Center), the world premiere of False Creeds (Alliance Theater), The Chosen (Actors Theater of Louisville), and the world premiere of A Marriage Minuet (Florida Stage).

When Wetherby's original station on York Road closed in 1902, for two decades the only rail access was via Wetherby's new station on Linton Road. This was some distance from the racecourse, involving a walk of just over 2 miles. There was therefore a station built at Wetherby Racecourse in 1924, with a ticket booth of wooden construction, starter signals, a ground frame and a footbridge. It even boasted electrical lighting and its own nameboard. It was located on the line going south east towards and and had two platforms; one for each running line. Race specials would stop at this 'Racecourse station', about three quarters of a mile from Linton Road towards Thorp Arch. These specials came from Leeds, Doncaster and Bradford Exchange and Sheffield. Reports vary as to when it closed; one report says it stayed open until 1963 with Racecourse Specials running to the station from Bradford Exchange on racedays,The Archive Photograph Service-Wetherby page 71 whilst another publication states that it was last used on Whit Monday 18 May 1959 and was demolished in 1962.Rogers.

Origins He was born at Whalley, Lancashire in about 1535, the son of John Woolton of Wigan, by his wife Isabella Nowell, a daughter of John Nowell of Read Hall near Whalley, and sister of Alexander Nowell (13 February 1602), Protestant theologian and Dean of St Paul's. Career He was admitted as a student of Brasenose College, Oxford, on 26 October 1553, when aged about 18, and supplicated for the degree of B.A. on 26 April 1555. Soon afterwards he left for Germany with his uncle Alexander Nowell and remained abroad until the accession of Queen Elizabeth I in 1558. On 25 April 1560 he was ordained a deacon by Edmund Grindal, Bishop of London, and he proceeded to priest on 4 June 1560. Woolton found patrons in William Alley, Bishop of Exeter, and Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford, Lord Lieutenant of Devon (1584-5). He was appointed to the rectory of Sampford Peverell (16 August 1561), to the rectory of Whimple, the vicarage of Braunton (4 May 1570), and to the rectory of Kenn (15 October 1573), all in Devon. A canonry at Exeter was conferred on him in March 1565; he read a divinity lecture there twice a week and preached twice every Sunday, and during the plague in the city during the summer of 1570 he attended the sick. By the new charter, dated 28 July 1578, Woolton, probably through his uncle's influence, was constituted the first warden of the collegiate church of Manchester. On 11 October in that year Bridget, Countess of Bedford, recommended him to Lord Burghley as a fitting person to fill the vacant bishopric of Exeter. He was duly appointed to the see, supplicated for the degrees of B.D. and D.D. at Oxford on 26 May 1579, and was consecrated in the archiepiscopal chapel at Croydon on 2 August 1579. As the bishopric had become of small value, Woolton was allowed to hold with it the place of archpriest at Haccombe in Devon (20 October 1581) and the rectory of Lezant in Cornwall (1584). Woolton remodelled the statutes at Exeter Cathedral. In 1581 he deprived Anthony Randal, parson of Lydford, a follower of the Family of Love, and made others who had accepted the Family's doctrines recant in the cathedral. Many strong accusations, some amounting to fraudulent misgovernment, were made against his running of the diocese to the archbishop of Canterbury in 1585. His answers to the charges were satisfactory, though he was obliged to admit his comparative poverty, and that he had placed his son in jail. Land purchases In 1593 he purchased from the Brett family the estates of Pilland, Upcott, Beara and Cladovin all in the parish of Pilton in North Devon. His son Dr John Woolton and his grandson, Anthony Woolton, lived at Pilland until about 1637.Reed, Margaret A., Pilton, its Past and its People, Barnstaple, 1985, p.32 Marriage and children He married and had a large family, leaving progeny including: *John Woolton, M.A., eldest son, a fellow of All Souls' College, Oxford, who erected a monument to his father's memory in Exeter Cathedral.See image He retired from practice at Exeter to the estate of Pilland in the parish of Pilton, North Devon, which his father had purchased. *(daughter), who married Francis Godwin,Dictionary of National Biography successively Bishop of Llandaff and Bishop of Hereford. *Alice Woolton, who married William Sharpe of Tiverton in Devon, 3rd son of Robert Sharpe, a merchant in the City of London, by his wife Jeliane Mallory, eldest daughter and co-heiress of Sir Richard Mallory, Lord Mayor of LondonVivian, Lt.Col.

It was one of the first recordings in the style later dubbed \\"hillbilly boogie\\" to reach a widespread audience, and eventually sold nearly three million copies. It was the first guitar instrumental to climb the country music charts, and then crossover and also gain high rankings on the popular music charts. \\"Guitar Boogie\\" has been interpreted and recorded by a variety of musicians. It is among the songs discussed as the first rock and roll record. Original song \\"Guitar Boogie\\" is an uptempo twelve-bar boogie-style instrumental and is patterned after older boogie-woogie piano pieces. Roosevelt Graves and His Brother recorded an instrumental \\"Guitar Boogie\\" in 1929, which was issued by Paramount Records. It features a descending arpeggio based on \\"Pinetop's Boogie Woogie\\", a piano-based piece recorded by Pinetop Smith in 1928. Music historian Larry Birnbaum describes it as \\"not the same as Arthur Smith's country hit by the same title\\". In his version, Smith performs the piano parts on guitar, alternating between boogie rhythmic patterns and soloing. Originally a jazz musician, Smith explained, \\"I guess I picked that [boogie-woogie] from Tommy Dorsey's 'Boogie Woogie', 'cause I didn't listen to country or blues, I listened to big band in those days\\". Smith first recorded \\"Guitar Boogie\\" in 1945 with the Rambler Trio, with Don Reno on rhythm guitar and Roy Lear on bass. There has been conflicting information on the type of guitar Smith used for the recording; several sources identify it as an acoustic guitar and others as an electric guitar. The piece was released under the name \\"the Rambler Trio featuring Arthur Smith\\" by the independent Super Disc Records label. Regionally \\"Guitar Boogie\\" did well, due in part to Smith's appearances on popular radio programs, such as Charlotte, North Carolina WBT's Carolina Hayride. In October 1948, MGM Records (which had purchased Super Disc and Smith's contract) re- released the instrumental under the name \\"Arthur (Guitar Boogie) Smith and His Cracker-Jacks\\".Although Craig Smith has written that \\"Guitar Boogie\\" was re- recorded for MGM, most sources, including Birnbaum, Dawson and Propes, McNeil, and Billboard, indicate that the 1945 recording was re-released by MGM in 1948. By 1949, \\"Guitar Boogie\\" reached number eight during a stay of seven weeks on the Hot Country Songs chart and number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, making it \\"the first guitar instrumental to climb the Country charts [then] crossover, and climb the Pop Charts\\". As an early popular example of hillbilly boogie, it is a link between 1940s Western swing and honky-tonk and 1950s rockabilly. Guitar Boogie Shuffle In the 1950s, rock and roll versions of \\"Guitar Boogie\\", usually titled \\"Guitar Boogie Shuffle\\" (but credited to Arthur Smith), were recorded. AllMusic critic Bruce Eder describes these renditions as having \\"new accents and a beat that took it out of country boogie and Western swing\\". In 1953, a version by the Super-Sonics was titled \\"New Guitar Boogie Shuffle\\"Rainbow R‚Äì4097 and another by the Esquire Boys with Danny Cedrone on guitar was titled \\"Guitar Boogie Shuffle\\".Nickelodeon 102‚ÄìA In 1958, a Philadelphia band, Frank Virtue and the Virtues, recorded it as \\"Guitar Boogie Shuffle\\".Hunt 324 In 1959, the Virtues' single reached number five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 27 on the Hot R&B; Sides chart, which Eder calls \\"one of the most popular and influential instrumentals of its era\\". Also in 1959, a version of \\"Guitar Boogie Shuffle\\" by Bert Weedon backed with \\"Bert's Boogie\\"Top Rank JAR 117 reached number ten in the UK charts. A version of \\"Guitar Boogie Shuffle\\" (simply titled \\"Guitar Boogie\\") by New Zealand musician Peter Posa became a bit hit in his native country in 1962. Ten years later, a rendition appeared on the Ventures' 1972 album, Rock & Roll ForeverUAS 5649 with Harvey Mandel guesting on lead guitar. Recordings by others Numerous guitarists have interpreted and recorded \\"Guitar Boogie\\". Early versions of the song include those by the Les Paul Trio (1947)Decca 29013 and Alvino Rey (1946 and 1948).Capitol 318 and 15223 In 1958, a different song titled \\"Guitar Boogie\\", with more chording and very different breaks, was included on Chuck Berry's second album One Dozen Berrys. (Jeff Beck, then with the Yardbirds later based his \\"Jeff's Boogie\\" on Berry's version). Freddie King's 1960 blues guitar instrumental \\"Hide Away\\" incorporates elements from various songs, including sections similar to those in \\"Guitar Boogie\\".

The manuscripts were begun in Milan while Leonardo was under the service of Ludovico Sforza and gathered together by his heir Francesco Melzi. The treatise was first published in France in 1632; after Melzi's version was rediscovered in the Vatican Library, the treatise was published in its modern form in 1817. The main aim of the treatise was to argue that painting was a science. Leonardo's keen observation of expression and character is evidenced in his comparison of laughing and weeping, about which he notes that the only difference between the two emotions in terms of the \\"motion of the [facial] features\\" is \\"the ruffling of the brows, which is added in weeping, but more elevated and extended in laughing.\\"Chapter CLXXII, trans.

History  The manuscripts were begun in Milan while Leonardo was under the service of Ludovico Sforza (between 1482 and 1499), being worked on substantially for the last 25 years of Leonardo's life. The works later published in this collection drew from writing of Leon Battista Alberti and Cennino Cennini. Upon Leonardo's death, he left his notebooks to his pupil and heir Francesco Melzi. to be published, a task of overwhelming difficulty because of its scope and Leonardo's idiosyncratic writing. Sometime before 1542, Melzi gathered together the papers for A Treatise on Painting from 18 of Leonardo's 'books' (two-thirds of which have gone missing). After Melzi's death in 1570, the collection passed to his son, the lawyer Orazio, who initially took little interest in the journals, but they were later dispersed. A version of the treatise was published in France in 1632. It was printed in an abridged form in French and Italian as Trattato della pittura by Raffaelo du Fresne in 1651. After Melzi's version was rediscovered in the Vatican Library, the treatise was first published in its modern form in 1817.

Overview  The Tres Amigas SuperStation project proposes to tie the East Coast, West Coast and Texas grids together via three 5 GW superconductive high-voltage direct current power transmission lines,High-Temp Superconductors To Connect Power Grids which permit a controlled flow of energy while also functionally isolating the independent AC frequencies of each side. Isolation is important because while all three grids have a nominal frequency of 60 Hz, their true frequencies at any given time can fluctuate by a significant margin (¬± 0.1 Hz), rendering the synchronization of the grids essentially impossible and leaving them out-of- phase from one another. With DC-links, however, the design can be scaled to 30 GW. Tres Amigas would use high-temperature superconductor (HTS) wire supplied by American Superconductor Corp.

Facing on the milling machine involves various milling operations, but primarily face milling. On the lathe, facing is commonly used in turning and boring operations. Other operations remove material in ways similar to facing, for example, planing, shaping, and grinding, but these processes are not labeled by the term \\"facing.\\"  Facing lathe operation  Facing on the lathe uses a facing tool to cut a flat surface perpendicular to the work piece's rotational axis. A facing tool is mounted into a tool holder that rests on the carriage of the lathe. The tool will then feed perpendicularly across the part's rotational axis as it spins in the jaws of the chuck. A user will have the option to hand feed the machine while facing, or use the power feed option. For a smoother surface, using the power feed option is optimal due to a constant feed rate. Facing will take the work piece down to its finished length very accurately. Depending on how much material needs to be taken off, a machinist can choose to take roughing or finishing cuts. Factors that affect the quality and effectiveness of facing operations on the lathe are speeds and feeds, material hardness, cutter size, and how the part is being clamped down.  Face milling operation  Facing on a milling machine is the process of cutting a flat surface perpendicular to the axes of the milling cutter. This process removes the material by rotating the facing tool in the counterclockwise direction as the table feeds the work piece across the cutter. Face milling can be achieved with an end mill, but is often done with a face mill, shell mill or a fly cutter. Face milling can be done in both manual machining and CNC machining. To obtain a smoother surface finish it is best to let the machine feed the table. Newer manual milling machines and CNC machines will have this option, but older milling machines will not. When available, use the machine feed instead of manually feeding the part. This will provide an optimal surface finish due to the constant feed maintained by the mill. Hand feeding the table will allow human error into the process. Machinists also have the option to take roughing cuts and finish cuts. Factors that affect the quality and effectiveness of facing operations on the mill are speeds and feeds, material hardness, cutter size, and how the part is being clamped down. Spotfacing is the facing of spots (localized areas), such as the bearing surfaces on which bolt heads or washers will sit.

Originally raised in 1915 for service during World War I as part of the 1st Australian Imperial Force, it was attached to the 6th Brigade, 2nd Division and served during the Gallipoli campaign and in the trenches of the Western Front in France and Belgium. Following the end of the war the battalion was disbanded in 1919, however, in 1921 it was re-raised as a unit of the part- time Citizens Forces in Melbourne, Victoria. In 1927, when the part-time forces adopted territorial titles, the battalion adopted the designation of 24th Battalion (Kooyong Regiment). In 1939, the 24th Battalion was merged with the 39th Battalion, however, they were split up in 1941 and in 1943, after being allocated to the 15th Brigade, the 24th Battalion was deployed to New Guinea before later taking part in the Bougainville campaign. Following the end of the war, the battalion was disbanded in 1946. History World War I The 24th Battalion was raised in May 1915 at Broadmeadows Camp in Victoria, as a unit of the all-volunteer Australian Imperial Force (AIF). Along with the 21st, 22nd and 23rd Battalion, the 24th formed part of the 6th Brigade, which was assigned to the 2nd Division. It had originally been planned that the battalion would be raised from personnel drawn from outside of Victoria and it was designated as an \\"outer states\\" battalion meaning that it would draw its recruits from the less populous states of Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia; however, due to the large number of recruits that had arrived at Broadmeadows at the time it was decided to raise the battalion there, from Victorian volunteers. As a result of the hasty decision to raise the battalion very little training was carried out before the battalion sailed from Melbourne just a week after being formed. Organised into four rifle companies, designated 'A' through to 'D', with a machine gun section in support, the battalion had an authorised strength of 1,023 men of all ranks.. After arriving in Egypt, the 24th completed its training during July and August before being sent to Gallipoli in early September as reinforcements for the forces that had landed there in April. Arriving on the peninsula on 4 September, the 24th served in the Lone Pine sector, taking over responsibility for the front line on the 12 September.. The position was very close to the Turkish trenches and was hotly contested. The position was so tenuous, that the troops holding it had to be rotated regularly, and as a result the 24th spent the remainder of the campaign rotating with the 23rd Battalion to hold the position against determined Turkish mining operations.. The battalion remained at Gallipoli for three months until the evacuation of Allied troops took place in December 1915. During the period that the 24th was deployed to Gallipoli, a 52-man detachment was sent to Salonika to act as packhorse handlers for the British contingent. George Ingram who received the 24th Battalion's only Victoria Cross for his actions at Beaurevoir in October 1918 Following this they returned to Egypt where they took part in the defence of the Suez Canal. In early 1916, the AIF was reorganised and expanded,. to prepare it for further operations. In March 1916, the AIF's infantry divisions began transferring to France and Belgium to serve in the trenches of the Western Front. Their first major action in France came at Pozi√®res and Mouquet Farm in July and August 1916, after which over the next two-and-a-half years the 24th Battalion took part in many of the major battles undertaken by the Australians in Europe. In 1917, after the Germans shortened their lines and withdrew to the Hindenburg Line, in May the 24th took part in the Second Battle of Bullecourt where the battalion suffered over 80 per cent casualties, before later in the year attacking around Broodseinde. In 1918, despite being severely depleted, it played a defensive role during the German Spring Offensive before supporting the attack at Hamel in July. In August, it joined the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, attacking around Amiens, and then joining the advance that followed. In early October 1918, the battalion attacked the Beaurevoir and then Montbrehain. It was during this final attack, on 5 October, that one of the battalion's subalterns, George Ingram, performed the deeds that resulted in him being awarded the Victoria Cross. At the conclusion of the battle, the 24th was withdrawn from the line for rest and reorganisation and did not take part in further combat before the war came to an end on 11 November 1918. Its strength dwindled as the demobilisation process began and personnel were repatriated back to Australia, and the 24th Battalion was disbanded in May 1919. During its service during World War I the battalion lost 909 men killed and 2,494 men wounded. A total of 19 battle honours were bestowed upon the 24th Battalion in 1927 for its involvement in the war.. Inter war years In 1921, the decision was made to perpetuate the numerical designations and battle honours of the AIF by re-raising the AIF units as part of the Citizens Forces (later renamed the \\"Militia\\").. To a large extent most of these units were raised in the areas from where their personnel had been drawn during the war, thus maintaining their regional links in the process. This was achieved by amalgamating the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 24th Infantry Regiment, and subsuming part of the 29th Light Horse Regiment to form a single battalion,. The 24th Battalion was raised in Victoria with its headquarters in Surrey Hills, with detachments spread out around the area including depots at Camberwell, Box Hill, Upper Hawthorn, Ringwood and Belgrave. In 1927, territorial designations were adopted by the Citizens Forces and the battalion became known as the 24th Battalion (Kooyong Regiment); the battalion's motto ‚Äì \\"I Hold Fast\\" ‚Äì was also approved at this time. Initially, the battalion was manned through a mixture of voluntary and compulsory service; however, in 1929 the Scullin Labor government abolished the compulsory service scheme and replaced it with the all-volunteer Militia. As a result of this, the battalion's strength fell significantly, but it was maintained through recruitment drives.. In June 1939, the battalion was merged with the 39th Battalion to become the 24th/39th Battalion and was assigned to the 10th Brigade, 3rd Division. World War II At the outset of the World War II, due to the provisions of the Defence Act (1903) which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory,. the decision was made to raise an all volunteer force to serve overseas‚Äîinitial operations were conceived to be likely in the Middle East, France and later possibly the United Kingdom‚Äîwhile it was decided that the Militia would be used to defend the Australian mainland and to improve Australia's overall level of readiness through the reinstitution of compulsory military service and extended periods of continuous periods of training.. Troops from the 24th Battalion cross the Hongorai River alongside Matilda tanks from the 2/4th Armoured Regiment in May 1945 During this time the 24th/39th Battalion undertook a number of periods of continuous training, firstly in September 1939 when a company-sized element exercised at Trawool for a month. In January 1940, the whole battalion was called up for a three-month training period, again at Trawool as the battalion's strength was increased through the arrival of men called up through the compulsory training scheme.. A further camp was undertaken between December 1940 and April 1941, this time at Nagambie Road, near Seymour in central Victoria. This was followed by another between August and October 1941, after which the battalion was called up to full-time service for the duration of the war. During this period, the decision was made to split the 24th/39th Battalion to reform its component units. Following Japan's entry into the war, the 39th Battalion was sent to New Guinea and would go on to play a key role in the Australian defensive actions along the Kokoda Track in July and August 1942.. Meanwhile, in May 1942, the 24th Battalion was moved to Queensland and then, in September, following the disbandment of the 10th Brigade, the 24th was transferred to the 15th Brigade. In 1943, the battalion was deployed to New Guinea aboard the transport Duntroon. along with the rest of the 3rd Division, arriving in Port Moresby over the course of three months between February and April. Later, they were transported by air to the Wau Valley and sent to take part in the fighting around Bobdubi Ridge and Mount Tambu. before patrolling the Wampit Valley during the Salamaua‚ÄìLae campaign. Later, in September 1943, the battalion attacked Markham Point,. before being detached to the 7th Division for the Finisterre Range campaign, during which they moved from Nadzab to Dumpu and helped to clear the Ramu Valley in early 1944, securing the 15th Brigade's western flank as the Australians pushed the advance towards Madang, which was secured in April 1944 by the 57th/60th Battalion.. In August 1944, the 24th Battalion was withdrawn back to Australia, embarking aboard the transport Van Heutsz at Madang, for rest and reorganization. Disembarking in Townsville, the soldiers were sent on home leave until early October.. After the soldiers returned from leave, a period of re-organisation and training followed on the Atherton Tablelands before the 24th Battalion deployed with the rest of the 15th Brigade to Bougainville in April 1945. On Bougainville the battalion took part in the drive to Buin in the southern sector, leading the advance to the Hongorai River along the Buin Road in April and early May, during which time they were involved in several small unit actions.. Further actions were fought by the battalion around Egan's Ridge and Mayberry's Crossing in mid-May as the battalion crossed the Pororei River. The Buin Road was cleared south towards the Peperu River, while the lateral track north to Oso was also cleared. In mid-June, after bypassing Unani along a lateral track that passed behind Monoitu, the battalion was involved in actions around the Hari and the Ogorata Rivers, pushing towards Kingori and then on to Katsuwa along the Commando Road, crossing the Mobiai.. Eventually they reached the Mivo River which was forded by early July. Shortly afterwards, the battalion was relieved by units of the 29th Brigade who continued the drive south after a defensive battle against a Japanese counter- attack. The war ended shortly afterwards, but the 24th Battalion remained on Bougainville until December 1945 when they were brought back to Australia. Following demobilisation, the battalion was disbanded on 19 January 1946. During its active service it lost 85 men killed and 184 wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: two Distinguished Service Orders, two Members of the Order of the British Empire, eight Military Crosses and one Bar, six Distinguished Conduct Medals, 16 Military Medals, one British Empire Medal, two George Medals, 10 Efficiency Medals, two Efficiency Decorations, and 33 Mentions in Despatches. The battalion was awarded 11 battle honours for its direct involvement in the war in 1961; at the same time it was also entrusted with those awarded to the 2/24th Battalion.

He was seated at Newmore Castle, in Easter Ross, Scotland. Early life John Munro, 4th of Newmore was a great-grandson of Sir George Munro, 1st of Newmore. According to historian Alexander Mackenzie, John Munro, 4th of Newmore was the strongest man in Ross-shire in his day and that tradition relates the most extraordinary feats of strength performed by him. One old tradition is that Munro of Newmore had succeeded in raising a piece of ordnance to his chest which Mackenzie of Fairburn could only raise to his knee.Mackenzie. p. 270. Parliamentary career John Munro, 4th of Newmore represented the county of Ross in parliament from 1733 to 1734. Military career John Munro joined the army and was appointed captain in the 42nd Royal Highlanders, otherwise known as the Black Watch in May 1740. Mutiny of the Black Watch In 1743, 109 men of the Black Watch regiment mutinied while stationed in London, England and attempted to return to Scotland. However, Munro of Newmore was one of the officers who went after them and persuaded them to return. Battle of Fontenoy Munro of Newmore fought in Flanders at the Battle of Fontenoy on 11 May 1745, where he highly distinguished himself. He fought under the command of his distant cousin Colonel Sir Robert Munro, 6th Baronet, chief of the Highland Clan Munro. On account of John Munro's bravery, John was on 17 July 1745 promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel.

Lutzner, Lucien-Marie Pautrier, and Albert S√©zary. These cells are described as the smaller forms of S√©zary cells, or S√©zary-Lutzner cells, and the two variants are recognised as being morphologically different. Aggregates of these cells in mycosis fungoides are known as a Pautrier's microabscesses. They are a form of T-lymphocytes that has been mutatedKumar, V., & et al. (2014). Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9th Edition. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Elsevier Health Sciences. This atypical form of T-lymphocytes contains T-cell receptors on the surface and is found in both the dermis and epidermis layers of the skin. Since Lutzner cells are a mutated form of T-lymphocytes, they develop in bone marrow and are transported to the thymus is order to mature. The production and maturation stages occur before the cell has developed a mutation. Lutzner cells can form cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which is a form of skin cancer.Lutzner, M. A. (1985). History of 2 cells in T cell lymphomas and leukemias: the cerebriform Lutzner cell in S√©zary syndrome and the polylobulated or polypetaloid cell in acute T cell lymphoma/leukemia. Hautarzt, 36(12). 657-662. Development of Lutzner cells Stem cell maturation and differentiation into blood cells and precursor, immune cells. Lymphocytes are white blood cells that form from a blood stem cell, hemocytoblast, in bone marrow and travel to other parts of the body, normally specific lymphoid tissues, to mature. After being produced, the stem cell differentiates into lymphoid stem cells. Then, T-lymphocytes further mature and differentiate into lymphoblasts when the hormone thymosin is secreted from the thymus. Finally, specialized immune cells, B cells and T cells, and nonspecialized immune cells, nature killer cells, are created from the lymphoblasts. This process is referred to as Leukopoiesis. Lutzner cells are an atypical form of T-cell lymphocytes and are normally CD4+.Ehrlich, A., & Schroeder, C. (2008). Medical Terminology for Health Professions. Independence, Kentucky: Cengage Learning. Lutzner cells develop because of clonal gene rearrangements in the T-cell receptor or antibody. This rearrangement occurs early in the differentiation process and creates novel T-cell receptors that mimic the structure of normal antibodies but are not able to function properly. This mutated form contains an enfolded nuclear membrane and has a cerebriform shape, resembling the shape and folds of the brain.Streilein, J. W. (1978). Lymphocyte Traffic, T-cell Malignancies and the Skin. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology, 71(3). 167-171. Lutzner cells can be best seen through electron microscopy because it is able to show the 3-D structure of the cell. Distribution Lutzner cells begin developing in bone marrow then travel to the thymus via the secretion of the hormone thymosin. The secretion allows them to differentiate and mature. Once the mutated cell is developed, it patiently waits in the thymus until an antigen presents itself. When a cutaneous lymphocyte antigen is expressed in the skin, the CD4+ Lutzner cell travels to the epidermis and dermis layers of the skin in order to bind to the antigen. Antibody mutation Mature lymphocytes are part of the specific immune system because they recognize previous invaders and assist the body in attacking these invaders. These cells have antibodies present on the surface of the extracellular membrane, which contribute to the destruction of the invader or antigen. An antibody is a large protein created by plasma cells and is also known as an immunoglobulin. It binds to a specific antigen to initiate an immune response. T-cell antibodies bind to antigens such as virus infected cells or tumor cells. In Lutzner cells, there is a mutation in the T-cell receptor that inhibits antigens like CD8 and CD7, but stimulates the over production of other antigens like CD4. This mutation is a clonal gene rearrangement at the TCR-Œ≥ gene. Clonal gene rearrangements create novel or new surface antibodies during early differentiation. Since these mutated antibodies are created early on, they are able to undergo mitosis and produce new T-cell lymphocytes that also contain the novel antigens. The abnormal quantity of T-cell receptors occurs because they are selected for since they express new qualities. CD4+ is the receptor that is selected for and increases in number in Lutzner cells. The neoplastic T-cells produce cytokines which active the expression of eosinophils and suppress the ability of T-cells to initiate an immune response. Since T-cell activity is lessened, the cells are not able to respond to invaders. Invaders are allowed to grow and produce lesions, and as the lesions increase in size the T-cell antigen is lost. Once this antigen is lost, the T-cell antibodies will never be able to detect the pathogen, allowing the pathogen to increase in size and cause an infection to occur.Cyriac, M. J., & Kurian, A. (2004). S√©zary cell. Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology, 70(5). 321-324. This leads to the development of non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma such as mycosis Fungoides and S√©zary disease. Types The mutated cells are mature T-lymphocytes and contain CD4+ receptors on the membrane surface. There are two variants of this mutated cell, Lutzner cells and S√©zary cells. Sometimes these names are interchangeable, but it has been determined through histology that they are morphologically different. Lutzner cells Lutzner cells are bigger than normal lymphocytes and contain extensive folding in their membrane. They are described at being cerebriform in shape, and can be diploid or tetraploid. It also contains a large nucleus with a minimum cytoplasm. Lutzner cells are more predominant in Mycosis Fungoides, but are also found in S√©zary Syndrome.Braun- Falco, O., & et al. (2013). Dermatology. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Springer Science & Business. S√©zary cells S√©zary cells are bigger than Lutzner cells, and have an overabundance of cellular folds in the membrane. They are also considered over pigmented and have large cerebriform nuclei with a small cytoplasm. S√©zary cells are found in both mycosis fungoides and S√©zary disease.Leong, A., & et al. (2005). Diagnostic Lymph Node Pathology. Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press. Diseases Lymphoma It is an unrare form of cancer that originates in the lymph system and causes the destructive effects in the immune system.Lennert, K. (2012). Malignant Lymphomas Other than Hodgkin‚Äôs Disease: Histology, Cytology, Ultrastructure, Immunology. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Springer Science & Business. There are two types of lymphoma, Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma and non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma. Both types of lymphomas form from a white blood cell or lymphocyte. Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma is the more common of the two cancers. The only way to tell these two forms of lymphoma apart is to perform a biopsy in order to get a microscopic view of the cancer cells. Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma involves the abnormal growth of undifferentiated lymphocytes, while non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma involves differentiated immune cells like B cells and T cells for example. Lutzner cells are involved with non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma.Shankland, K. R., & et al. (2012). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The Lancet, 380(9844). 848-857. Non- Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma An histological view of skin tumors in the epidermis and dermis layers of the skin. It is the most common type and diverse range of lymphoma. Normally, it occurs with a B cell becoming abnormal, but also occurs when a T cell becomes abnormal. The mutated cell then divides to create multiple cells. Lymphoma cells can be distributed all over the body and into various tissues. Lutzner cells are found in skin tissue, more specifically, the epidermis and dermis layers. An accumulation of Lutzner cells in the layers of the skin can cause cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Cutaneous cell lymphoma is the second most common form of non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma.Willemze, R., & Dreyling, M. (2010). Primary cutaneous lymphomas: ESMO Clinical Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. Ann Oncol, 21(5). 177-180. Two forms of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma associated with abnormal T-lymphocytes or Lutzner cells are Mycosis Fungoides and S√©zary Syndrome. These two diseases are very similar, but both present themselves in different ways. =Mycosis fungoides= The effects of Mycosis Fungoides on the skin during the plaque or tumor phase. * Signs and Symptoms: ** 4 Phases:Makdisi, J., & Friedman, A.

It is a small brick building constructed just before World War II. It serves the area the village of Lake George, the surrounding town and those areas of Queensbury which comprise the 12845 ZIP Code. The building was designed by Treasury Department Supervising Architect Louis A. Simon in a restrained Colonial Revival architectural style with some modernist touches. Later a mural of the Lake George area was added to the lobby. In 1989, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the only post office in Warren County so recognized. Building The post office is located at the west end of a narrow lot that slopes gently down toward the shore of the lake. It is on the northeast corner of the intersection. The neighborhood is commercial, with the surrounding structures used for that purpose. A parking lot is located to the east of the post office, accessible from Kurosaka. The building is set back generously from the street, with some landscaping and hedges located in front. It is a one-story steel frame building on a raised foundation of poured concrete and sided in brick laid in English bond. The five-bay front facade is distinguished by a projecting three-bay central pavilion with a beveled-cornered hipped roof covered in slate. All other roofs are flat. Narrow stone coping runs around the entire building at the roofline. A four-bay rear projection contains the loading dock. The central pavilion has angled corners. Its front facade has a centrally located segmental arch entrance with brick surround, lintel and keystone. A carved metal eagle surmounts the door. \\"UNITED STATES POST OFFICE\\" is written in bronze letters across the top of the facade, with \\"LAKE GEORGE NEW YORK 12845\\" in smaller letters below. Three granite steps lead up to the entrance from the sidewalk; a wheelchair ramp runs from the top to the south along the facade. It is flanked by the original iron railings and lanterns, atop fluted posts. Inside, the lobby is L-shaped. It is floored in terrazzo, with a veined Vermont marble dado running around the room to counter level. Above it is wood panelling with bulletin boards. The tables and counters are original. Judson Smith's mural is painted on canvas above the entrance to the postmaster's office. History Lake George has had a post office since 1825, 12 years after it was designated the seat of the newly created county, known as Caldwell after a major landowner of the time. For most of the 19th century the Post Office rented space in other buildings, as the village grew from being an economic center of the southeastern Adirondacks and stop on the major trade route to Canada to a popular summer colony. In 1938 Congress appropriated $75,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) for the current post office as part of an ongoing relief effort during the Great Depression. The land was acquired and construction began the next year. The new post office was opened for business early in 1941. Louis Simon, the supervising architect at the Treasury Department, used the Colonial Revival style, standard for most post offices in small communities across the country at that time. Notable features of that style in the Lake George post office are the brick facing, eagle ornament and symmetrical fenestration. The projecting central pavilion with flanking bays is also a specifically Georgian touch. Smith's mural of Lake George He also used some design elements more specifically associated with the contemporary Moderne and Art Deco styles, such as the angled corners, asymmetrical window panes and large expanses of brick above the windows. Only two other post offices in the state, at Frankfort and Middleport, built around the same time, use the same design. The Westhampton Beach post office on Long Island, also built in 1940, is also very similar. All of them show the influence of another Long Island post office, in Rockville Centre, built in 1937. Judson Smith's mural was hung in 1942. Other than the installation of fluorescent lighting in the lobby in 1973, there have been no significant changes to the building since then.

Overview Plex Systems began as an internal IT project at an automotive parts manufacturer, MSP Industries Corporation, in 1989. The company was formed as Plexus Systems LLC in 1995 by Robert Beattyhttps://www.capitalatplay.com/a-tale-of-two-passions/, providing client/server manufacturing software. The company began offering its software via the software as a service (SaaS) or cloud computing model when Plexus Online was launched in 2001. In 2006 Apax Partners acquired a majority interest in the company. In 2009, the company changed its name to Plex Systems and renamed its flagship product Plex Online. On June, 2012, the company announced the acquisition from a group of share holders, including Apax Partners by Francisco Partners. In June 2012, Accel Partners invested $30 million in Plex: In June 2014, Plex secured $50 million in additional funding led by T. Rowe Price, which joined existing investors Francisco Partners and Accel Partners. Aberdeen Group suggested in its \\"Aberdeen AXIS: ERP in Manufacturing 2009‚Äù report that Plex Systems was among the top four performing ERP vendors. Plex was the only ERP software solution provider placed entirely within the ‚ÄúChampion‚Äù performance category, just ahead of SAP AG. (There is evidence of Plex acting as a sponsor for Aberdeen Group so this report from Aberdeen may be biased) However, other vendors evaluated in the same report are also sponsors of Aberdeen Group.Epicor Blog Historically, the company has not released detailed financial information, citing its status as a privately held corporation. However, in May 2012, the company reported a revenue increase of 30.6% in the first quarter ending March 31, compared to a year earlier. Recurring revenue increased by 30.5 percent, representing the 19th consecutive quarter of growth.\\" Plex is known as the first provider of a complete SaaS ERP solution for manufacturing companies. Several IT software bloggers have written about Plex‚Äôs ability to provide a wide scope of critical features for manufacturers in a SaaS model, where larger ERP vendors had not succeeded at the time. In 2014, the firm raised $50 million in funding to support expanded product development, as well as investments in marketing and sales. The Plex Manufacturing Cloud The Plex Manufacturing Cloud is a software as a service (SaaS) or cloud application ERP that manages the manufacturing process and supports the functions of production, inventory, shipping, supply-chain management, quality, accounting, sales, and human resource departments, in addition to the traditional ERP roles of finance/accounting, procurement, human capital management, etc. Plex is targeted towards manufacturing industries with rigorous traceability, quality and food safety requirements, including automotive, aerospace, food & beverage, and life sciences or medical manufacturing. The system must be accessed using a web browser, making its functions available from anywhere with an Internet connection. The software is designed to provide managers and engineers with real-time visibility to production data. While Plex Systems calls the SaaS solution \\"ERP\\", the software also includes the following integrated functions: * Enterprise resource planning (ERP): * Manufacturing execution system (MES) or manufacturing operations management (MOM) * Quality management systems (QMS). It helps maintain compliance with quality standards including ISO 9000 and ISO 14000, QS-9000, TS-16949, AS-9100, etc. * Customer relationship management (CRM) * Supply chain management software (SCMS): Software as a service (SaaS) or cloud application The Plex Manufacturing Cloud is built on a multi-tenant architecture. Software as a service (SaaS) (also referred to as cloud application) is an application delivery model in which the user accesses software over the Internet, from anywhere, at any time. The physical location and ownership/maintenance burden of the system that actually serves the software is outside the responsibility and concern of the end users. Some IT professionals have expressed concern about moving ERP to a SaaS model. At the same time many companies have successfully performed such deployments with Plex Systems and other providers. SaaS applications are deployed atop the platform layer of the cloud computing stack. These applications tend to be sold as a subscription, shifting the burden of the software cost across the useful life of the software, and tend to be accounted as an operating expense (OpEx). This is in contrast to traditional methods that require upfront payment or financing and tend to be accounted as a capital expense (CapEx).

The plan is to showcase five different forms of renewable energy and create a complex that includes a hotel, spa, cable car ride, 65 new homes, a cafe, viewing platforms, bird watching centre and connection with the Weardale Railway. History In 2002, the Weardale Task Force decided that Eastgate could provide a sustainable facility as part of the wider regeneration of Weardale. In 2004, an interim report found that the Eastgate Geothermal Exploration Borehole was capable of providing water at 26¬∞C, potentially providing hot water and heating for the buildings on site. The planning application was submitted in April 2008. Progress On 29 September 2009, the plans got unanimous outline approval by the County Durham strategic planning committee. As of October 2009, the plans awaited examination by Government Office North East, who will decide whether to call in the decision or give it full approval. In September 2010, ¬£1 million funding that was to be received was cancelled as part of the government's budget cut programme, leaving the project's future in serious doubt. It is hoped the money will be raised through the private sector. Controversy Opinion seems to be split on the benefits of the project. Supporters claim it will provide 350 jobs, encourage eco-friendly lifestyles, act as a prototype for other similar projects and regenerate a region left devastated by foot and mouth and the closure of the Lafarge Cement UK works, potentially turning the area into a tourist attraction comparable with the Lake District. Objectors claim the development would ruin the scenery, that the hot springs lack the heat needed for success, the energy created would be insignificant and that large quantities of fuel sources would need to be transported to Weardale.

Many people are waiting for a 'show' to start behind a red curtain. When the music starts, H.P. Baxxter comes out from behind the curtain and starts rapping. The people start dancing and then there are some shots of women dressed in underwear and rabbit ears in the same room (although it is empty).

The group, including its subsidiaries, offers electric DC motors, AC motors, encoders (sensors), gears, and electric motor controllers. History On December 5, 1961, Interelectric AG was founded. After the factory building in Sachseln had been completed in 1963, Interelectric began producing shearing foils for electric razors of Braun GmbH. At the time, there were 17 employees. The technological basis of the company was a technical process called galvanoplasty or electroforming. Soon afterwards, a separate development department for electromechanical devices was created. In 1967, Braun GmbH was sold to Gillette. Following up on the groundbreaking work on DC motors that had been carried out in the company's own R&D; department, the engineers were able to develop an entire range of models of DC motors. At the same time, the engineers in Sachseln patented the manufacturing process for the ironless rotor with the diamond-shaped winding. In 1970, the DC motors were registered under the trademark 'maxon'. In 1999 the company restructured and rebranded as maxon motor AG. In 2012, the company started offering DC motor drive configuration tooling through its website. In 2017 zub motion control AG, based in the city of Lucerne, Switzerland, was acquired by the company. Parvalux Electric Motors Ltd based in Bournemouth, UK, was acquired by maxon motor AG in 2018. Together with customers, the company increasingly develops complete mechatronic solutions, consisting of a motor, gearhead, sensors, controller, batteries, and software. These solutions are available in standard or unique build. In July 2019, the company re-branded as 'maxon'. The new brand identity epitomizes this strategy. Products The company developed and patented its own ironless winding system. Its motors are available as either brushless, or brushed with graphite brushes or precious metal brushes. A section of its brushless DC motor program is available as flat (pancake) build for use in restricted space envelopes. The types of gearheads available are spur gearheads and planetary gearheads made of plastic, ceramic (zirconium dioxide and aluminium oxide) or stainless steel. The company mainly supplies combination drive units to suit high-precision applications. The maxon brand is known for reliability and build quality and therefore its products are widely used in medical applications using sterilisable products. For other sectors, such as Aerospace, the company offers units which can withstand extreme environmental conditions, too. Accompanying the core business of electric motors, the group also offers a range of position encoders and two programs of motor control electronics. With the acquisition of Parvalux, AC motors are now offered by the group via this subsidiary. Application areas The company specializes in customer specific drive solutions. It produces more than 5 million drive units per year in approx. 12'000 variations. Its main market areas are medical technology, industrial automation, security technology, measuring and testing technology, communication technology, automotive and aerospace technology.http://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/content/profile maxon became known to a broader public when its products were chosen by the NASA for the Mars rover projects Sojourner, Spirit and Opportunity. Locations maxon has its headquarters, along with a production plant, in Sachseln, in the Swiss Canton of Obwalden. The company gives its name to the railway station, Ewil Maxon, which adjoins the plant and has frequent connections to the city of Lucerne and beyond.http://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/content/production Besides its Sachseln plant, maxon has production facilities at Sexau in Germany, Veszpr√©m in Hungary, Cheonan in South Korea and Taunton, MA, United States of America.

The Guild had several roles within the town. The majority of its income was spent maintaining priests and a chantry at St Martin's, but it also maintained almshouses, roads and the bridge over the River Rea at Deritend. Its hall on New Street provided a social focus for the town, with feasting and the provision of a clock, chimes and a bell turret It had a number of paid officials including a warden, a clerk, an organist, a keeper of the hall and gardens, a midwife and a bellman ‚Äì one of whose jobs was to announce when the spit ceased to turn at feasts. These officials had a high degree of status within the town: a list of twenty nine leading men of Birmingham in 1482 placed the Master of the Guild above the High Bailiff of the borough. The Guild survived the investigations of the commissioners established by Henry VIII in 1545 to examine the religious endowments that remained after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but was suppressed along with its associated chantries under Edward VI in 1547.

The Moderate Party of Rhode Island gained official party status and ballot access via a federal lawsuit and the gathering of 34,000 signatures on August 18, 2009. However, following the 2018 gubernatorial election, the party lost official status. The Moderate Party of Rhode Island states that its mission is \\"to recruit, support, and elect candidates that will govern by building consensus around smart, pragmatic, common-sense policies which will address the structural deficits currently plaguing Rhode Island's economic, educational, ethical and environmental systems\\".  History  The Moderate party gained official party status and ballot access via a federal lawsuit and the gathering of 34,000 signatures on August 18, 2009. The Moderates fielded candidates for various state offices in the 2010 elections. The Party Founder and 2010 gubernatorial candidate, Kenneth Block, stated that the party's primary focus would be the Rhode Island General Assembly; however, the possibility of further candidates for governor and other state offices was likely. In 2012, the Moderate Party fielded lawyer Nick Gelfuso for a Rhode Island Senate seat, realtor Joseph Botelho, Jr. for a Rhode Island House of Representatives seat, and three candidates in local elections. All were unsuccessful. The following year, party founder Kenneth Block left the Moderate Party and closed down the campaign accounts, website, and social media accounts. However, the party's status as an officially state-recognized political party remained. The legal status included the right to ballot access in the 2014 elections. In September 2014, the Moderate Party's chosen gubernatorial candidate James Spooner withdrew for health reasons. Perennial third-party candidate and former Cool Moose Party founder Robert J. Healey was selected to replace Spooner on the November ballot. Following his speedy nomination, the Rhode Island Republican Party filed a claim with the board of elections contesting the appointment. Representing himself, Healey successfully argued that his Moderate Party candidacy was legitimate. In August 2018 Tony Jones was appointed to the North Kingstown School Committee making him the first ever Moderate in public office. Following the 2018 gubernatorial election, where Moderate Party nominee William Gilbert earned only 2.7 percent of the vote, the party lost official status. Political parties in Rhode Island must receive at least 5 percent of the vote in the most recent gubernatorial election to have official status. As a result, the Moderate Party is, once again, a minor party.  Platform  The platform of the Moderate Party was considered centrist under Ken Block's leadership. In 2013, the Moderate Party's website contained sections for their positions on economic, educational, ethical and environmental issues.  Economy  The Moderate Party of Rhode Island supports: *Lowering Rhode Island business taxes in line with Massachusetts' business taxes. *Bringing the total compensation packages (including wages, benefits, pension amounts and pension eligibility) for state employees in line with what private sector workers earn. *Producing a balanced budget without utilizing selling tobacco settlement funds or revenue anticipation bonds but by reducing spending in general.  Education  The Moderate Party of Rhode Island supports: *Converting day care expenditures for low income households into pre-school aid. *Providing incentives to the best teachers to teach in the toughest schools. *Evaluating all teachers and administrators annually by administrative, parental, and peer reviews and by standardized test scores and providing incentive pay for the top 15% of performers, while providing mentoring, training and a financial disincentive to the worst 15% of performers. *Providing life skills courses to non-college-tracked students. *Allowing non-certified professionals in certain content areas to teach in public schools. *Applying policies used by Rhode Island's charter schools to the public educational system, and allowing the development for more charter schools in the state. *Publishing what they say is a \\"model\\" teacher's contract. *Making state aid to local school districts contingent on how closely the locally negotiated teacher's contract adheres to the model contract.  Ethics  The Moderate Party of Rhode Island supports toughening ethics laws and employment agreements, claiming it makes elected, appointed, and employed state officials far more accountable for their actions.  Environment  The Moderate Party of Rhode Island supports what they have termed an aggressive program of protection and enhancement in conjunction with encouraging economic growth opportunities.  Social issues  The Moderate Party, as a whole, takes no official stand on \\"social issues,\\" and each individual candidate, if elected, would be directed to vote their conscience. The focus of the party is the economy, education, ethics, and environment of Rhode Island, which they refer to as \\"the 4 E's\\".

He was one of the contributors to a report to Lord Kitchener, the British Secretary of State for War five days after the initial attack.Report to Lord Kitchener He continued to take an interest in the treatment of poison gas victims for the rest of the war. In his war memoirs, Herringham admitted that he learned more medicine during his time in France than in any other five-year period. Post-war career Herringham stood as a candidate for parliament in 1918 for the London University seat. He was offered the position of Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford in 1920, but refused, considering himself to be unsuitable to the post. He was Vice-Chancellor of the University of London between 1912 and 1915. He served as chairman of the General Nursing Council for England and Wales between 1922 and 1926, and was a member of the council of Bedford College, University of London, at the time a college for women. Between 1921 and 1929 he was chairman of the governors of the Old VicW. J. O'Connor, British physiologists 1885-1914: a biographical dictionary (Manchester University Press, 1991) and wrote for theatre's magazine. In 1929 he delivered the annual Harveian Oration to the Royal College of Physicians. He was appointed an Honorary Fellow of Keble in 1931. He died on 23 April 1936 at his sister's home in Lymington.British Medical Journal obituary Family In 1880 he married Christiana Powell at Guildford. They had two sons, one of whom died from acute arthritis as a child whilst the other died in the First World War. His wife became a celebrated Edwardian artist and patron of the arts. In 1906, Herringham accompanied her to India where on this and another visit, she made copies of the Buddhist cave paintings at Ajanta near Hyderabad, which were deteriorating badly.Mary Lago, Christiana Herringham and the Edwardian art scene (University of Missouri Press, 1995, p. 226) Herringham contributed a brief description of their expedition to the published edition of the paintings.Ajanta Frescoes by Lady Herringham By 1911, Herringham's wife suffered from delusions of pursuit and persecution and was admitted to an asylum, spending the rest of her life in mental institutions. In 1916, Herringham was cited as a co-respondent in a divorce case brought by William Rothenstein.National Archives Publications In addition to numerous contributions to scholarly journals and medical textbooks, his publications include: * A Physician in France * History of the Great War, based on official documents: Medical Services * The life and times of Dr. William Harvey References See also *List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of London *Portrait by Sir James Gunn on \\"Your Paintings\\" Category:1855 births Category:1936 deaths Category:People from Guildford Category:People educated at Winchester College Category:Alumni of Keble College, Oxford Category:British Army generals of World War I Category:Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:Royal Army Medical Corps officers Category:Vice-Chancellors of the University of London Category:19th-century English medical doctors Category:20th-century English medical doctors ","title":"Wilmot Herringham"},{"id":"24678725","text":"Documentary mode is a conceptual scheme developed by American documentary theorist Bill Nichols that seeks to distinguish particular traits and conventions of various documentary film styles. Nichols identifies six different documentary 'modes' in his schema: poetic, expository, observational, participatory, reflexive, and performative. While Nichols' discussion of modes does progress chronologically with the order of their appearance in practice, documentary film often returns to themes and devices from previous modes. Therefore, it is inaccurate to think of modes as historical punctuation marks in an evolution towards an ultimate accepted documentary style. Also, modes are not mutually exclusive. There is often significant overlapping between modalities within individual documentary features. As Nichols points out, \\"the characteristics of a given mode function as a dominant in a given film‚Ä¶but they do not dictate or determine every aspect of its organization.\\" (Nichols 2001) Nichols' documentary modes Poetic mode Early documentary filmmakers, bolstered by Soviet montage theory and the French Impressionist cinema principle of photogenie, appropriated these techniques into documentary filmmaking to create what Nichols would later call the poetic mode. Documentary pioneer Dziga Vertov came remarkably close to describing the mode in his \\"We: Variant of a Manifesto\\" when he proclaimed that \\"kinochestvo\\" (the quality of being cinematic) is \\"the art of organizing the necessary movements of objects in space as a rhythmical artistic whole, in harmony with the properties of the material and internal rhythm of each object.\\" (Michelson, O‚ÄôBrien, & Vertov 1984) The poetic mode of documentary film tends toward subjective interpretations of its subject(s). Light on rhetoric, documentaries in the poetic mode forsake traditional narrative content: individual characters and events remain undeveloped, in favor of creating a particular mood or tone. This is particularly noticeable in the editing of poetic documentaries, where continuity is of virtually no consequence at all. Rather, poetic editing explores \\"associations and patterns that involve temporal rhythms and spatial juxtapositions.\\" (Nichols 2001) Joris Ivens‚Äô Regen (1929) is paradigmatic of the poetic mode, consisting of unrelated shots linked together to illustrate a rain shower in Amsterdam. That the poetic mode illustrates such subjective impressions with little or no rhetorical content, it is often perceived as avant-garde, and subsequent pieces in this mode (Godfrey Reggio‚Äôs Koyaanisqatsi (1982) for example,) are likely to be found within that realm. Expository mode Documentary forefather John Grierson offers an explanation for the move away from poetic documentary, claiming filmmakers, \\"got caught up in social propaganda ‚Ä¶We got on to the social problems of the world, and we ourselves deviated from the poetic line.\\" (Sussex 1972) The expositional mode diverges sharply from the poetic mode in terms of visual practice and story-telling devices, by virtue of its emphasis on rhetorical content, and its goals of information dissemination or persuasion. Narration is a distinct innovation of the expositional mode of documentary. Initially manifesting as an omnipresent, omniscient, and objective voice intoned over footage, narration holds the weight of explaining and arguing a film‚Äôs rhetorical content. Where documentary in the poetic mode thrived on a filmmaker‚Äôs aesthetic and subjective visual interpretation of a subject, expositional mode collects footage that functions to strengthen the spoken narrative. This shift in visual tactics gives rise to what Nichols refers to as \\"evidentiary editing,\\" a practice in which expositional images \\"...illustrate, illuminate, evoke, or act in counterpoint to what is said‚Ä¶[we] take our cue from the commentary and understand the images as evidence or demonstration‚Ä¶\\" (Nichols 2001: 107) The engagement of rhetoric with supporting visual information founded in the expositional mode continues today and, indeed, makes up the bulk of documentary product. Film features, news stories, and various television programs lean heavily on its utility as a device for transferring information.  Participatory mode  In the participatory mode \\"the filmmaker does interact with his or her subjects rather than unobtrusively observe them.\\"Nichols, B. Introduction to Documentary, 2nd Edition. USA: Indiana University Press. p.179 This interaction is present within the film; the film makes explicit that meaning is created by the collaboration or confrontation between filmmaker and contributor. Jean Rouch's Chronicle of a Summer, 1960, is an early manifestation of participatory filmmaking. At its simplest this can mean the voice of the filmmaker(s) is heard within the film. As Nichols explains \\"what happens in front of the camera becomes an index of the nature of interaction between filmmaker and subject.\\"ibid. According to Nichols (2010), in the participatory mode of documentaries, ‚Äúthe filmmaker becomes a social actor (almost) like any other (almost because the filmmaker retains the camera and with it a degree of potential power and control over events)‚Äù (p. 139.) Through interviews, the filmmaker‚Äôs voice is shown as it combines contributing material about the story that they are trying to tell. An example of this is the machine invented by Errol Morris called the Interrotron. This machine allows for the subject to engage with the director directly while still being able to look into the lens of the camera. Observational mode The observational mode of documentary developed in the wake of documentarians returning to Vertovian ideals of truth, along with the innovation and evolution of cinematic hardware in the 1960s. In Dziga Vertov's Kino-Eye manifestoes, he declared, \\"I, a camera, fling myself along‚Ä¶maneuvering in the chaos of movement, recording movement, startling with movements of the most complex combinations.\\" (Michelson, O‚ÄôBrien, & Vertov 1984) The move to lighter 16mm equipment and shoulder mounted cameras allowed documentarians to leave the anchored point of the tripod. Portable Nagra sync-sound systems and unidirectional microphones, too, freed the documentarian from cumbersome audio equipment. A two-person film crew could now realize Vertov‚Äôs vision and sought to bring real truth to the documentary milieu. Unlike the subjective content of poetic documentary, or the rhetorical insistence of expositional documentary, observational documentaries tend to simply observe, allowing viewers to reach whatever conclusions they may deduce. Pure observational documentarians proceeded under some bylaws: no music, no interviews, no scene arrangement of any kind, and no narration. The fly-on-the-wall perspective is championed, while editing processes use long takes and few cuts. Resultant footage appears as though the viewer is witnessing first-hand the experiences of the subject: they travel with Bob Dylan to England in D.A. Pennebaker's Dont Look Back [sic] (1967,) suffer the stark treatment of patients at the Bridgewater State Hospital in Frederick Wiseman's Titicut Follies (1967,) and hit the campaign trail with John F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey in Robert Drew‚Äôs Primary (1960.) Reflexive mode The reflexive mode considers the quality of documentary itself, de-mystifying its processes and considering its implications. It also includes filmmakers within the film. In Dziga Vertov‚Äôs Man with a Movie Camera (1929,) for example, he features footage of his brother and wife in the process of shooting footage and editing, respectively. The goal in including these images was, \\"to aid the audience in their understanding of the process of construction in film so that they could develop a sophisticated and critical attitude.\\" (Ruby 2005) Mitchell Block‚Äôs ...No Lies (1974,) functioned in a notably different manner, as it reflexively and critically questioned the observational mode, commenting on observational techniques and their capacity for capturing authentic truths. In this way, the reflexive mode of documentary often functions as its own regulatory board, policing ethical and technical boundaries within documentary film itself. Performative mode The performative mode, the final mode Nichols discusses, is easily confused with the participatory mode, and Nichols remains somewhat nebulous about their distinctions. The crux of the difference seems to lie in the fact that where the participatory mode engages the filmmaker to the story but attempts to construct truths that should be self-evident to anyone, the performative mode engages the filmmaker to the story but constructs subjective truths that are significant to the filmmaker him or herself. Deeply personal, the performative mode is particularly well-suited to telling the stories of filmmakers from marginalized social groups, offering the chance to air unique perspectives without having to argue the validity of their experiences, as in Marlon Riggs‚Äô 1990 documentary Tongues Untied about his experiences as a gay black dancer in New York City. The departure from a rhetoric of persuasion allows the performative film a great deal more room for creative freedom in terms of visual abstraction, narrative, etc. Stella Bruzzi (2000), by contrast, holds a broader view of the performative mode. Inspired by J. L. Austin‚Äôs notion of the performative, which Nichols avoids, Bruzzi argues that documentary films are by default performative because they are ‚Äúinevitably the result of the intrusion of the filmmaker onto the situation being filmed.‚Äù In particular, Bruzzi considers documentaries that foreground the ‚Äúartificialisation by the camera‚Äù perfect examples of the performative mode. Hongjian Wang (2016) extends the discussion of the performative mode by Nichols and Bruzzi to the ‚Äúperforming camera,‚Äù which documents by reenacting the subjective perspective of the subjects (not necessarily that of the filmmaker) in the documentary films. By ‚Äúperforming‚Äù the point of view of the subjects, the performative documentaries put the audience in the positions of the subjects. Wang further distinguishes between ‚Äúthe empathetic performative mode,‚Äù which prompts audience identification with the subjects, and ‚Äúthe critical performative mode,‚Äù which provokes the audience to feel disgusted by, angry at, and critical about the subjectsWang, Hongjian. (2016). ‚ÄúDocumenting through Reenacting: Revisiting the Performative Mode in Chinese Independent Documentaries.‚Äù Filming the Everyday: Independent Documentaries in Twenty- First-Century China, ed. Paul Pickowicz and Yingjin Zhang, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers. pp. 153-165.. With the filmmaker visible to the viewer, and freed to openly discuss his or her perspective in regard to the film being made, rhetoric and argumentation return to the documentary film as the filmmaker clearly asserts a message. Perhaps the most famous filmmaker currently working in this documentary mode is Michael Moore. The performative mode is also manifested in ethnographic film, such as \\"Incidents of Travel in Chichen Itza\\" by Jeff Himpele and Quetzil Castaneda. In this visual ethnography of cultural event of the spring equinox involving new age tourism at a sacred Maya site in Mexico, the ethnographers both document the event and provide an ethnographic questioning of the meanings that are projected on the physical heritage objects that attract 50,000 tourists to the equinox at Chichen. In this film, unlike the performative documentaries of Michael Moore in which there is a specific take away message and argument, the ethnographic filmmakers create an open-ended, polyphonic film in which the audience is provided greater opportunity to define the meanings, messages, and understandings of what the film represents. In general, documentaries, especially educational documentaries are scripted such that the audience is persuaded to accept a specific lesson or message, the performative mode of documentary is used to break from a monological or monotone understanding not only through the use of dialogical principles of dialogical anthropology, but of experimental ethnography. The Himpele and Castaneda therefore create an ethnographic documentary that expands the idea of experimental ethnography as a set of principles for writing a text to producing and postproducing ethnographic film. Documentary modes and narrative structure In her book Looking Two Ways (1996), Toni de Bromhead criticises Nichols for his focus on documentary as a rational discourse. She claims that documentary reaches for \\"hearts and souls not just minds\\" and that central to documentary story telling is \\"emotional response and empathy\\". She contrasts Nichols‚Äô rational journalistic view with what she refers to as the cinematic qualities of documentary. For her, the cinematic is experiential, emotive, expressive and celebrates subjectivity. While the journalistic view focuses on analysis, learning, information and objectivity. The cinematic uses creative cinematic devices, values the expression of opinion, foregrounds the point of view of the filmmaker and creative treatment is expected. On the other hand the journalistic, rational approach is founded upon checkable facts, has recourse to experts and eye witness testimony, the validity of filmmakers opinion is questioned and creative treatment rejected. De Bromhead wants to move away from problems of \\"objectivity and truth\\" and focus on issues of narrative and its \\"relationship to the represented\\". She understands that documentary‚Äôs \\"claim to the real\\" is subjective i.e. that it can never be truly objective, that it is always mediated by the subjectivity of the filmmaker. In doing so De Bromhead makes a case for a kind of documentary storytelling that cannot be constructed through words alone but weaves together image, sound, action and structure to produce meaning. She says that in contrast to Nichols, whose position appears to be that documentary is first and foremost informative, the real aim of documentary story telling is filmic pleasure. The story for her is an interplay between the filmic self and objective world as mediated by the filmmaker. De Bromhead presents her own ‚Äòmodes‚Äô of documentary. Where Nichols concerns are broad and include history, style, technology & practice. Her concern is purely with properties of narrative structure. For example she states that; \\"observational is not a narrative form but a narrative style\\". De Bromhead‚Äôs documentary modes Linear mode Classic or Hollywood storytelling; character-based, follows standard three-act structure, based around conflict and resolution as a storytelling arc. Examples: Primary (1960) - Drew and Leacock. Detective storytelling; the story is based around the process of an investigation and the obstacles faced by the filmmaker. In some cases the failure to make the film becomes the story of the film. Examples: Films by Michael Moore & Nick Broomfield. Discursive mode Discursive storytelling; gives priority to information, facts and logic, typical of current affairs documentaries, political documentaries, may give more space to cinematic concerns than purely journalistic filmmaking, often utilizes archive footage to illustrate the story. Examples: The War On Democracy (2007) - John Pilger & Rosie the Riveter (1980) ‚Äì Connie Field. Episodic mode Episodic storytelling; which juxtaposes situations that have no narrative or causal relations, meaning is produced by the juxtaposition of the episodes, often ordered around one dominant theme or idea (e.g. the seasons). Examples: Nannook of the North (1922) - Robert Flaherty & Hospital (1970) - Frederick Wiseman. Poetic mode Poetic storytelling; is built up around audio visual poetic associations, films avoid following a specific storyline or conventional narrative logic, utilizes similar structures to poetry such as metaphor and disjunction. Examples: Listen to Britain (1942) - Humphrey Jennings & Rain (1929) - Joris Ivans. Hybrid mode The Diary Film; the linear logic of passing time is used to structure the narrative in either linear or episodic form. Examples: Tarnation (2003) - Jonathan Caouette. The Road Movie; the linear logic of a physical journey is used to structure the narrative in either linear or episodic form. Examples: Don‚Äôt Look Back (1966) - D.A. Pennebaker. Documentary modes and interactive storytelling Research into the recent and rapid evolution of the documentary genre has recently started to recognise interactive documentary or ‚ÄòiDocs‚Äô as a field of distinct practice. In 2012, the journal ‚ÄòStudies in Documentary‚Äô devoted an entire issue to a debate on the subject and in doing so the journal attempted to frame the debate and ask questions about this new field of study. A broad definition of interactive documentary would include any attempt to document the real that utilises digital technology and forms of interactivity either in the form of delivery technology or through production processes. Aston & Gaudenzi (2012) argue that in fact interactive documentaries are not the result of a linear evolution of the documentary genre. But a distinct and separate mode of practice that goes beyond simple representation of the real, moving towards one that constructs the real through an immersive and enacted user experience. While it is generally accepted that Aston & Gaudenzi's (2012) formulation is still contested, its usefulness lies in that the discussion emerges as a response to Nichols (1992) and de Bromhead's (2009) debate on the subject of documentary modes of representation. Such a trajectory offers a clear historical relationship to the notion of a documentary tradition and provides a basis for describing a boundary around these new formations of practice. Aston & Gaudenzi (2012) offer four modes for understanding the nature of interactive documentary; the conversational mode as a conversation with a computer that is typified through forms of game-play, the hypertext mode as means of structuring user experience through a series of branching choices; the participative mode as two-way conversation between author and users that actively involves the user in production of material; the experiential mode as a way of utilising space and embodiment to structure the user experience particularly where the experience of the real and the virtual become blurred.

The ad was the most highly awarded in the world in 1999/2000 and has gone on to gain cult status.  Content  The ad begins with an English-sounding man in a suit who walks through a busy street. He starts the ad by saying \\"For years, I've lived a double life. In the day, I do my job ‚Äì I ride the bus, roll up my sleeves with the hoi-polloi.\\", then a number of different characters are seen including the same man sitting undressed on a bed with a woman (\\"But at night, I live a life of exhilaration,\\"), a woman of Asiatic appearance (\\"of missed heartbeats and adrenalin.\\"), a middle-aged man on a leather couch (\\"And, if the truth be known\\",) with teenage girl who sits down beside him, a young refugee wearing a hat (\\"a life of dubious virtue.\\"), a man beside a car, (\\"I won't deny -\\") and wearing a scary ‚Äì looking mask (\\"I've been engaged in violence, even indulged in it.\\"), a shirtless boy on a skate ramp (\\"I've assailed adversaries, and not merely in self-defence.\\"), a man in a bathtub (\\"I've exhibited disregard for life,\\"), a black man in a wheelchair (\\"limb\\"), and the man in the bath again (\\"and property,\\"), a \\"couch potato\\" (\\"and savoured every moment.\\"), a person with a deep voice in a corset (\\"You may not think it, to look of me\\"), a foreign sounding woman with a shaved head (\\"but I have commanded armies,\\"), a preschool child (\\"and conquered worlds.\\"), a cyclist wearing sunglasses and a scarf over his face (\\"And though in achieving these things\\"), an older man with long white hair (\\"I've set morality aside,\\"), a topless pregnant woman holding a soundless crying baby (\\"I have no regrets.\\"), the black man spinning in his wheelchair again (\\"For though I've led a double life, at least I can say\\") and finally the first man, in close up (\\"- I have lived.\\") before a black screen comes up at the end saying \\"Do not underestimate the power of PlayStation\\".  Reception  The ad is internationally known (even though, it is a mainly European ad) and many people from the US and Asia have commented on its quality.

Life He was born at Ross in Herefordshire, on 24 or 25 June 1719, the only son of John Rosse, attorney in that town. He was educated at the grammar school in Hereford, was admitted a pensioner at St John's College, Cambridge (April 1737), and on the following 22 June became a Somerset scholar of the third foundation at his college. He graduated B.A. 1741, M.A. 1744, B.D. 1751, D.D. 1756, and on 10 July 1744 was incorporated at Oxford. From March 1744 to 1770 he held a fellowship at St. John's, and down to 1768 he discharged college duties. In 1757 Ross was appointed to the preachership at the Rolls Chapel, although Richard Hurd was a competitor and received the support of William Warburton and Charles Yorke, and in the same year became a king's chaplain. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society on 23 February 1758. Lord Weymouth, who had been one of his private pupils, gave him in 1760 the benefice of Frome, Somerset, and he retained it until his death; he further received in March 1769 the twelfth canonry in Durham Cathedral. He was consecrated on 25 January 1778 as bishop of Exeter, and held with the bishopric, as was the case with many successive occupants of the see, the archdeaconry of Exeter, a prebendal stall in the cathedral, and the rectory of Shobrooke in Devon. He retained the vicarage of Frome, but resigned the canonry at Durham. He disapproved of the introduction of Sunday schools, but in a sermon before the House of Lords on 30 January 1779 he advocated an extension of toleration to dissenters. John Wesley attended a service in Exeter Cathedral on Sunday, 18 August 1772, and was much pleased with it; Ross asked him to dinner, which Wesley also enjoyed. For some time before his death his faculties were greatly impaired. He died at the palace, Exeter, on 14 August 1792, and was buried on 18 August in the south aisle of the choir, the place being marked by a flat tombstone and the inscription 'J. R., D.D., 1792.' The bishop left most of his fortune to Miss Eliza Maria Garway, a distant relative; she was stepdaughter of Samuel Collett of Worcester, and afterwards married Sir Nigel Bowyer Gresley of Drakelow, Derbyshire, son of Sir Nigel Gresley, 6th Baronet. Works Ross edited in 1749 letters of Cicero. When Jeremiah Markland brought out a volume of 'Remarks on the Epistles of Cicero to Brutus,' and added 'a Dissertation upon Four Orations ascribed to Cicero', Ross published an ironical 'Dissertation in which the Defence of P. Sulla ascribed to Cicero is clearly proved to be spurious after the manner of Mr. Markland.' He was the author of sermons, and revised Richard Polwhele's English Orator; and was a patron to George Ashby.

Each state or territory has the authority to set its own laws pertaining to vehicle inspections, all (with the exception of the self-governing territory of Norfolk Island) have some form of inspection, either periodically or before a transfer of ownership. Australian Capital Territory Vehicles in the following categories must be inspected by an authorised vehicle examiner: *When registering a brand new vehicle for the first time (usually the dealer does this prior to delivery) *Upon transfer of ownership if the vehicle is over six years old *Before transferring a registration from interstate regardless of the vehicle's age *Before re-registering a vehicle if the previous registration was canceled or expired more than 12 months ago *If a defect notice is issued Once a vehicle is registered, it generally will not need to be inspected again if it remains with the same owner. However, the Australian Capital Territory has a random inspection scheme, vehicles can be spot checked whether occupied or not. If faults are discovered, a defect notice can be issued in which case the owner will be required to have repairs made, and obtain a full inspection from a licensed examiner with 14 days to clear the notice. If egregious safety violations are found, the vehicle's registration can be suspended on the spot and the operator will need to have the vehicle towed. Vehicles powered by natural gas or propane must receive a special annual gas inspection. New South Wales Vehicles over five years old are required to obtain an e-Safety Check' prior to annual registration renewal or before transferring a registration from interstate. This was previously known as a \\"Pink Slip\\", and the term is still used colloquially. Northern Territory Vehicle Roadworthy Inspections for light vehicles (<4.5 ton GVM/ATM) are required once the vehicle is 5 years old, 10 years old, then annually. Vehicles 5 years or older, seeking registration in the NT for the first time require a Roadworthy Inspection. All vehicles over 10 years old require a roadworthy inspection every year. Queensland Queensland Transport requires any vehicle to have a safety inspection (and the resulting Safety Certificate prominently displayed) before it can be offered for sale or have its interstate registration transferred.Safety certificates The inspection checks the general condition of the vehicle itself (suspension, body condition, etc...) and certain items of basic safety equipment such as the tyres, brakes, lights, windshield, etc... The certificate is valid for 1,000 km or 3 months (whichever is sooner) if the vehicle is being offered for sale by a dealer, and for 2,000 km or 2 months if being sold by an individual. There are some exceptions, vehicles being sold in rural parts of the state are exempt if driving to the nearest inspection station would present a hardship, and vehicles that are only being sold for parts likewise do not require a safety inspection. Sellers who are required to have a safety certificate but either do not obtain one or fail to display it properly while the vehicle is advertised for sale are subject to a $500 on the spot fine. There are no periodic safety inspections in Queensland once a vehicle is registered, however, mobile road teams conduct random emissions inspections through a program called OVERT, and drivers may be summoned if their vehicles are not within legal guidelines or emits visible smoke. South Australia The majority of privately owned vehicles do not need to be inspected to be legally driven or have their interstate registration transferred to South Australia. Vehicles with certain types of modifications, specifically engine, chassis, wheel-base, seating capacity, brakes, steering, or suspension modifications require a certificate of roadworthiness prior to registration (or as a condition of continued registration). Additionally, several other categories of vehicles also require a certificate: *Vehicles cited for safety faults by the police. *Vehicles that were previously written off and/or salvaged. *Rebuilt, self-constructed or homemade vehicles (such as classic car restorations or kit cars) *Vehicles transferred from interstate that are over seven years old and weigh more than 4.5 tonnes (10,000 lbs). *Vehicles that were transferred from left-hand to right-hand drive. *Buses with a seating capacity of 13 persons or more Tasmania A safety inspection is required for: *Transferring a mainland (interstate) registration to Tasmania *Re- registering a vehicle whose previous registration expired or was cancelled more than three months ago *Re-registering a vehicle that was written off and repaired *Registering a vehicle converted from left-hand to right-hand drive Victoria Similar to Queensland, VicRoads requires that a vehicle being sold, registered from interstate have a current Certificate of Roadworthiness from a licensed vehicle inspector. Additionally, vehicles that are cited by the police for safety defects must also obtain a certificate. Victoria does not require an inspection upon transfer of an interstate registration if the vehicle remains with the same owner. Western Australia A vehicle inspection is required before a vehicle can be registered for the first time, after a lapse in registration, if a vehicle has received certain modifications, or has been cited for safety faults (a \\"yellow sticker\\") by the police. Certain commercial and public transport vehicles must be inspected annually.http://www.transport.wa.gov.au/licensing/20695.asp Western Australia does not require an inspection upon transfer of an interstate registration if the vehicle remains with the same owner and the vehicle has been owned for more than 12 months.

In 1992, it was acquired by Diamond Offshore Drilling. History In 1953, the company was founded by Alden J. \\"Doc\\" Laborde, who also founded Tidewater, and John Hayward. Hayward was the builder of the Barnsdall rig and holder of the patent on submersible drilling barge methodology. Charles Murphy, Jr. of Murphy Oil invested $500,000 in the company and assisted Laborde in finding additional investors. Alexander Shipyard in New Orleans constructed the company's first rig, which was delivered in 1954 and immediately contracted to Shell Oil. The rig was named Mr.Charlie after Charles Murphy. Mr. Charlie was retired in 1986. After noticing the stability of submersible rigs when they were only partially submerged for relocation, Laborde designed and constructed the first purpose-built V-shaped semi-submersible drilling rig, Ocean Driller, delivered in 1963. In 1982, Ocean Ranger, one of the company's oil platforms, sank in a violent storm in Canadian waters east of Newfoundland, killing 84 people. Also in 1982, the company took delivery of Odyssey. The rig suffered a blowout in 1988. In 1991, Murphy Oil acquired the company. In 1992, Diamond Offshore Drilling acquired the company from Murphy Oil for $358 million.

Design and operation The submersible drilling platform is supported on large pontoon-like structures. These pontoons provide buoyancy allowing the unit to be towed from location to location. Once on the location, the pontoon structure is slowly flooded until it rests securely on its anchors, of which there are usually two per corner. The operating deck is elevated 100 feet above the pontoons on large steel columns to provide clearance above the waves. After the well is drilled, the water is pumped out of the buoyancy tanks and the vessel is re-floated and towed to the next location. Submersibles, as they are known informally, operate in relatively shallow water, since they must rest on the sea floor. Other floating vessel types are used in deeper water depths. The term Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit (MODU) is generally used for all offshore drilling rigs that can be moved from location to location. Evolution Blue Water Rig No. 1 The first offshore mobile drilling platform was the Hayward-Barnsdall Breton Rig 20, first operated in 1949.The Evolution of Offshore Mobile Drilling Units, Richard J. Howe, Esso Production Research Company, Drilling and Production Practice, 1966, American Petroleum Institute 66-120 This rig had evolved from the inland drilling barges which were used to drill in marshes and protected waters in up to 10 feet of water. The Breton Rig 20 was 160 feet by 85 feet, and could work in 20 feet water depth. By 1958, the number of submersible drilling rigs had increased to around 30. In 1961, Shell Oil successfully converted an existing submersible rig Blue Water Rig No.1 into the first semi submersible drilling unit for operation in the Gulf of Mexico when it was found to have good stability and motions whilst being towed at a partial draught.Technology Pioneers - Drilling Semi-submersible Rigs, Ocean Energy Center : http://www.oceanstaroec.com/fame/2000/semisubmersible.htm Alden J. Laborde designed and constructed the first purpose-built V-shaped semi-submersible drilling rig, Ocean Driller, delivered in 1963.

Rodman, Renewal theology: systematic theology from a charismatic perspective, 1996 p.240; Making moral decisions: a Christian approach to personal and social ethics, Paul T. Jersild, 1991, p. 24 Today, most cultures retain a distinction between lying in general (which is discouraged under most, but not all, circumstances) versus perjury (which is always unlawful under criminal law and liable to punishment). Similarly, historically in Jewish tradition, a distinction was made between lying in general and bearing false witness (perjury) specifically. On the one hand, bearing false witness (perjury) was always prohibited according to the decalogue's commandment against bearing false witness, yet on the other, lying in general was acknowledged to be, in certain circumstances \\"permissible or even commendable\\" when it was a white lie, and it was done while not under oath, and it was not \\"harmful to someone else\\". The book of Exodus describes the Ten Commandments as being spoken by God, inscribed on two stone tablets by the finger of God, broken by Moses, and rewritten on replacement stones by the Lord. The command against false testimony is seen as a natural consequence of the command to ‚Äúlove your neighbor as yourself‚Äù. This moral prescription flows from the command for holy people to bear witness to their deity. Offenses against the truth express by word or deed a refusal to commit oneself to moral uprightness: they are fundamental infidelities to God and, in this sense, they undermine the foundations of covenant with God. Ancient understanding The Hebrew Bible contains a number of prohibitions against false witness, lying, spreading false reports, etc.Exodus 20:16, Deuteronomy 5:20, Exodus 23:1-2, Proverbs 19:5, Isaiah 29:20-22 For a person who had a charge brought against them and were brought before a religious prosecution, the charge was considered as established only on the evidence of two or three sworn witnesses. In cases where false testimony was suspected, the religious judges were to make a thorough investigation, and if false testimony were proven, the false witness was to receive the punishment he had intended to bring on the person falsely accused.Deuteronomy 19:17-19 For example, since murder was a capital crime, giving false testimony in a murder case was subject to the death penalty. Those eager to receive or listen to false testimony were also subject to punishment.Proverbs 21:28 False witness is among the six things God hates, king Solomon says. False testimony is among the things that defile a person, Jesus says. The witness who hid what he had seen or what he knew bore his iniquity; if he realized his guilt, he had to confess his sin, brought to the Lord a female lamb or goat from the flock (or two turtledoves or two pigeons, or a tenth of an ephah of fine flour) for a sin offering as his compensation for the sin he committed. The lying witness is a deceitful man, who mocks at justice. He is like a war club, or a sword, or a sharp arrow. ‚Ä≥A false witness will not go unpunished.‚Ä≥ king Solomon says. ‚Ä≥A false witness will perish‚Ä≥ if he does not repent. Some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia came upon Stephen and seized him and brought him before the council and set up false witnesses against him. These false witnesses said: \\"This man never ceases to speak words against this holy place (Temple of Jerusalem) and the law, for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place (Stephen said that the temple of Jesus‚Ä≤ body had been destroyed by others but raise it up by Him in three days, according with what Jesus had said ) and the customs that Moses delivered to us.\\"(Stephen said what Jesus had said namely He had come to fulfil the Law of Moses and the Prophets) And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw Stephen‚Ä≤ s face was like the face of an angel. Many testified falsely against Jesus, but their statements did not agree. At last two witnesses said they had heard Him saying He would destroy that temple and in three days built another, not made with hands, (He really had meant the resurrection of His body, as a temple of the Holy Spirit, destroyed by others but raise it up by Him). Yet even about this their testimony did not agree. The narrative in 1 Kings 21 describes a case of false testimony. King Ahab of Israel tried to convince Naboth the Jezreelite to sell him the vineyard Naboth owned adjacent to the king's palace. Ahab wanted the land to use as a vegetable garden, but Naboth refused to sell or trade the property to Ahab saying, ‚ÄúThe forbid that I should give up to you what I have inherited from my fathers!‚Äù1 Kings 21:4 (JPS) Ahab's wife Jezebel then conspired to obtain the vineyard by writing letters in Ahab's name to the elders and nobles in Naboth's town instructing them to have two scoundrels bear false witness claiming that Naboth has cursed both God and the king. After Naboth was subsequently stoned to death, Ahab seized possession of Naboth's vineyard. The text describes the as very angry with Ahab, and the prophet Elijah pronounces judgment on both Ahab and Jezebel.1 Kings 21:20-23 The narrative in 2 Samuel 1 also contains a narrative which is often interpreted as false testimony.Commentary on 2 Samuel 1, The NIV Study Bible. 1995. Barker, Kenneth, Burdick, Donald; Stek, John; Wessel, Walter; Youngblood, Ronald, eds. Zondervan. Grand Rapids, MI, USA The 1 Samuel narrative had described Saul as killing himself by falling on his own sword after having been wounded by the Philistines on Mount Gilboa and being in a situation with no hope of victory or escape.1 Samuel 31 However, 2 Samuel tells of an Amalekite, who was probably on Mount Gilboa to strip the dead of their possessions, appearing to David with Saul's crown and royal arm band and giving testimony that he had himself killed king Saul. David immediately ordered that the Amalekite be put to death, saying, \\"Your blood be on your head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, 'I have killed the ‚Äôs anointed.'\\"2 Samuel 1:16 ESV The truth of the Amalekite's testimony did not need to be determined for the sentence to be carried out: either the Amalekite had killed King Saul, or he had given false testimony to David regarding Saul's death. Both crimes were seen as equally deserving of the death penalty. The ancient understanding of false testimony not only includes testifying with false words, but also failing to come forward with relevant testimony in response to a public charge. ‚ÄúIf a person sins because he does not speak up when he hears a public charge to testify regarding something he has seen or learned about, he will be held responsible.‚ÄùLeviticus 5:1 NIV Jewish doctrine Jewish law enumerates 613 Mitzvot or commandments, including several commandments related to honest testimony as related to judicial procedure. Maimonides (the Rambam) further explained that if false testimony was calculated to occasion a monetary loss, the court should inflict a monetary loss of equal value on the false witness. Likewise, if the false testimony was calculated to result in death, the false witness is to suffer the same kind of death.The Commandments Vol. 1 p. 193 as quoted and discussed in Teaching Mitzvot: Concepts, Values, and Activities by Bruce Kadden, 2003, p. 107. In Sefer Hachinuch, one who fails to testify when one is aware of evidence is compared to one who stands idly by the blood of one's neighbor.The Commandments Vol. 2 p. 77 as quoted and discussed in Teaching Mitzvot: Concepts, Values, and Activities by Bruce Kadden, 2003, p. 107. The severity of breaking the ninth commandment is reflected in a midrash: New Testament doctrine According to the New Testament, Jesus explains that obedience to the prohibition against false testimony from the ten commandments is a requirement for eternal life.Matthew 19:18, Mark 10:19, Luke 18:20 According to Jesus, false testimony comes from the sinful desires of the heart and makes people unclean.Matthew 15:18-19 The New Testament narrative also describes several occasions where people testify falsely against Jesus and his disciples. When Jesus was on trial before the Sanhedrin, the chief priests were looking for evidence to justify putting Jesus to death, and the narrative in Matthew's Gospel states that many false witnesses () came forward. Matthew 26:59-61 Jesus remained silent until the high priest charged him under oath to answer whether Jesus is ‚Äúthe Christ, the Son of God‚Äù. Jesus answered affirmatively.Matthew 26:63-64 The Acts of the Apostles describes the disciple Stephen being seized and brought before the Sanhedrin. Those who opposed Stephen persuaded false witnesses to testify that Stephen was guilty of blasphemy against Moses and against God. Stephen used the occasion of his trial to remind the Sanhedrin of the Old Testament testimony of rebellion, idolatry, and persecution of the prophets that culminated in the murder of Jesus. The crowd was so angry that Stephen was stoned to death.Acts 6-7Commentary on Acts 6-7, The NIV Study Bible, Zondervan (1995) The New Testament depicts the Apostles as being appointed as true witnesses to the ministry and resurrection of Jesus Christ.Acts 1 The Apostle Paul uses the Old Testament prohibition of false testimony to describe his fear of God if found to be a false witness about God regarding the resurrection. In , Paul lists a number of the ten commandments which can be summed up in the saying \\"You shall love your neighbor as yourself\\". The Textus Receptus and the King James Bible include \\"You shall not bear false witness\\", but this commandment is missing from some early manuscripts containing Romans 13 and the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges suggests that it is \\"perhaps to be omitted, on documentary evidence\\".Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Romans 13, accessed 30 September 2016 Eastern Orthodox view The Eastern Orthodox Christian is expected to uphold truth, at all times and in all places, without exception. Slander and gossip are equally evil, and the initial speaker is responsible for any further damage caused as the report is spread. Unless there is a compelling reason to speak ill of someone, as is the case of protect oneself or others against harm, it is not permissible even if the account be true. Saint Dorotheus of Gaza said, \\"You may well know about the sin, but you do not know about the repentance.\\"Dorotheos of Gaza, Discourses and Sayings, trans. Eric P. Wheeler (Kalamazoo, MI: Cistercian Publications, 1977), p. 135 Roman Catholic doctrine The Roman Catholic Church interprets the command against \\"false witness\\" more broadly than the Jewish historical context of perjury, and considers it as a broad prohibition against misrepresenting the truth in one's relation with others. This commandment enjoins truthfulness and respect for other's good name, even the dead. It prohibits detraction (true faults), calumny (false faults), gossip, rash judgment, lying, and the violation of secrets. The Catechism of the Catholic Church (¬ß2469) states, \\"...The virtue of truth gives another his just due. Truthfulness keeps to the just mean between what ought to be expressed and what ought to be kept secret: it entails honesty and discretion. In justice, \\"as a matter of honor, one man owes it to another to manifest the truth.\\" Catholic teaching describes truth as uprightness in human action and speech and is the virtue which consists of showing oneself true in deeds and truthful in words, and in guarding against duplicity, dissimulation, and hypocrisy. The person of truth gives another his just due. Truthfulness balances what ought to be expressed and what ought to be kept secret: it entails both honesty and discretion. In justice, one man owes it to another to manifest the truth. The disciple of Christ consents to \\"live in the truth,\\" that is, in the simplicity of a life in conformity with the Lord's example, abiding in his truth. \\"If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not live according to the truth.\\"(1 John 1:6) To keep ‚Äúa clear conscience toward God and toward men‚Äù(Acts 24:16), Christians must follow Christ's example ‚Äúto bear witness to the truth.‚Äù(John 18:37) The Christian is not to ‚Äúbe ashamed then of testifying to our Lord.‚Äù(2 Timothy 1:8) In situations that require witness to the faith, the Christian must profess it without equivocation. Christian witness to the Gospel and the obligations that flow from it are an act of justice that establishes the truth or makes it known. Catholic teaching regards martyrdom as the supreme witness given to the truth of the faith: it means bearing witness even unto death. Christ's disciples have \\"put on the new man, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.\\"(Ephesians 4:24) By \\"putting away falsehood,\\" they are to \\"put away all malice and all guile and insincerity and envy and all slander.\\" (Ephesians 4:25, 1 Peter 2:1) Public statements contrary to the truth take on a particular gravity. In court it becomes false witness. (Proverbs 19:9) False statements under oath are perjury. Acts such as these contribute to condemnation of the innocent, exoneration of the guilty, or the increased punishment of the accused. (Proverbs 18:5) These are great sins, because they gravely compromise the exercise of justice and the fairness of judicial decisions. Respect for the reputation of persons forbids every attitude and word likely to cause unjust injury. One is guilty of rash judgment who assumes the moral fault of a neighbor without sufficient foundation. One is guilty of detraction who discloses another's faults and failings to persons who did not know them without objectively valid reason. One is guilty of calumny (a misrepresentation intended to harm another's reputation) who harms the reputation of others and gives occasion for false judgments concerning them by remarks contrary to the truth. These sins violate both the commandment against false witness, as well as the command to love one's neighbor as oneself. Not only are gossip and slander held to be covered by the commandment against false witness, Catholic teaching also holds that ‚Äúevery word or attitude is forbidden which by flattery, adulation, or complaisance encourages and confirms another in malicious acts and perverse conduct. Adulation is a grave fault if it makes one an accomplice in another's vices or grave sins. Neither the desire to be of service nor friendship justifies duplicitous speech.‚Äù Furthermore, boasting and bragging are viewed as offenses against truth. So is irony aimed at disparaging someone by maliciously caricaturing (mocking) some aspect of his behavior. The Catholic Church teaches that \\"A lie consists in speaking a falsehood with the intention of deceiving.\\" According to the Bible, the Lord denounces lying as the work of the devil: \\"You are of your father the devil, . . . there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.\\" (John 8:44) Lying is the most direct offense against the truth. To lie is to speak or act against the truth in order to lead someone into error. By injuring man's relation to truth and to his neighbor, a lie offends against the fundamental relation of man and of his word to the Lord. Lying is a mortal sin when it does grave injury to the virtues of justice and charity. Lying is a profanation of speech, whereas the purpose of speech is to communicate known truth to others. The deliberate intention of leading a neighbor into error by saying things contrary to the truth constitutes a failure in justice and charity. The culpability is greater when the intention of deceiving entails the risk of deadly consequences for those who are led astray. By violating the virtue of truthfulness, a lie does real violence to another. It affects his ability to know, which is a condition of every judgment and decision. It contains the seed of discord and all consequent evils. Lying is destructive of society; it undermines trust among men and tears apart the fabric of social relationships. However, the right to the communication of the truth is not unconditional in Catholic teaching. Everyone must conform his life to the Gospel precept of fraternal love. In concrete situations one should judge whether it is appropriate to reveal the truth to someone who asks for it. Charity and respect for the truth should dictate the response to every request for information or communication. The good and safety of others, respect for privacy, and the common good are sufficient reasons for being silent about what ought not be known or for making use of a discreet language. The duty to avoid scandal often commands strict discretion. No one is bound to reveal the truth to someone who does not have the right to know it. The golden rule helps one discern, in concrete situations, whether it would be appropriate to reveal the truth to someone who asks for it. The sacrament of confession is inviolable. Reformation and Post-Reformation doctrines John Calvin taught that the commandment against false witness prohibits all calumnies (gossip and slander) and false accusations which might injure our neighbor's good name, and any falsehood which might impair his fortune. Christians must assert only the truth with pure motives for the maintenance of our neighbor's good name and estate. Calvin asserted that God's intent in the prohibition of false witness extended ‚Äúmore generally to calumny and sinister insinuations by which our neighbors are unjustly aggrieved.‚Äù Since perjury in court is amply prohibited by the third commandment (against swearing falsely), the commandment against false witness must extend to protection of one's good name. ‚ÄúThe equity of this is perfectly clear. For if a good name is more precious than riches, a man, in being robbed of his good name, is no less injured than if he were robbed of his goods; while, in the latter case, false testimony is sometimes not less injurious than rapine committed by the hand.‚Äù Martin Luther explained that this commandment is given ‚Äúfirst of all that every one shall help his neighbor to secure his rights, and not allow them to be hindered or twisted, but shall promote and strictly maintain them, no matter whether he be judge or witness.‚Äù Luther also asserted that this command extends to the spiritual jurisdiction and prohibited slander against preachers and Christians by calling them heretics, apostates, seditious, wicked, etc. Thirdly, he described the commandment against false witness to prohibit the public judgment and reproof of his neighbor. One can indeed see and hear the neighbor sin, but one has no command to report it to others. If one judges and passes sentence, one falls into a sin which is greater than his (except for judges, parents, and preachers.) Slanderers are not content with knowing a thing, but ‚Äúproceed to assume jurisdiction, and when they know a slight offense of another, carry it into every corner, and are delighted and tickled that they can stir up another's displeasure [baseness], as swine roll themselves in the dirt and root in it with the snout.‚Äù Luther describes this as meddling with the judgment and office of God, and pronouncing sentence and punishment with the most severe verdict. Without wielding the sword, the slanderer employs a poisonous tongue to the shame and hurt of your neighbor. Matthew Henry taught that the prohibition against false witness concerns our own and our neighbor's good name. ‚ÄúThou shalt not bear false witness‚Äù forbids: ‚Äú1. Speaking falsely in any matter, lying, equivocating, and any way devising and designing to deceive our neighbor. 2. Speaking unjustly against our neighbor, to the prejudice of his reputation; and (which involves the guilty of both). 3. Bearing false witness against him, laying to his charge things that he knows not, either judicially, upon oath (by which the third commandment, and the sixth and eighth, as well as this, are broken), or extrajudicially, in common converse, slandering, backbiting, tale-bearing, aggravating what is done amiss and making it worse than it is, and any way endeavoring to raise our own reputation upon the ruin of our neighbor‚Äôs.\\" Notes Further reading * The Jewish Study Bible, Tanakh Translation. 2004.

This film was produced by AVM Productions. Plot This movie starts off with the assassination of Sanjeevayya (Suman), the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. His last wish is for his son Arjun Prasad (Rana Daggubati) to become the next Chief Minister. However, Arjun's cousin Dhanunjay (Subbaraju) has his own dreams of becoming the Chief Minister. Arjun is approached by Ali (Harsha Vardhan), who has given 10 crores to Sanjeevayya to resolve a land dispute in Ali's favour. Arjun finds about his father's corruption, and his mother Rajeswari Devi (Suhasini Maniratnam) validates it while sharing Sanjeevayya's desire for a casteless and corruption-less government. Arjun's uncle Mahadevayya (Kota Srinivasa Rao), whom he refers to as Peddaina (Sanjeevayya's elder brother), tolerates corruption as long as it helps his family stay in power. Arjun decides to implement his father's dream and enrolls Ali and a news reporter named Ratna (Priya Anand) to quietly win support of his party's MLAs. Arjun bribes his way to win support from MLAs and ministers and is elected Chief Minister. An angry Dhanunjay attempts to assassinate Arjun and is asked to resign. Arjun encounters resistance from his own party in his drive to eliminate corruption and plots to win support of Alliance Party leader Munnuswami's (Ahuti Prasad) daughter Archana (Richa Gangopadhyay) by making her fall for him. His attempts to woo her are successful, and he saves his government while losing Archana's support when she realizes that she has been used. As a condition for Munnuswami's support, he lets an MLA's son go scot free, even though the son was accused of raping and murdering of young tribal girl. Rajeswari Devi rebukes Arjun's move and warns the step as compromises that lead to corruption. That same night, she dies. Arjun resolves to go ahead with his corruption elimination drive and resigns the same evening while creating sensation in the media for exposing corruption. Arjun wins the ensuing election after leaving his uncle's party and establishing a new party. His effort wins back Archana's support.

Headquartered in Ankeny, the district is well known in Iowa for accomplishments in academics, athletics and activities. Ankeny Schools are accredited by North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (AdvancEd) and the Iowa Department of Education, and are part of the Central Iowa Metro League (CIML). For more than a decade, the district has been one of the fastest growing school districts in Iowa, averaging student enrollment growth of more than 300 students per year during that time. . The district will serve more than 9,380 students in 2012‚Äì2013 and is the 8th largest district in the state (by total students served). By 2015-2016, the district is projected to enroll 10,446 students and by 2017‚Äì2018 the district is projected to enroll 11,282 students. Physically, the district encompasses and has more than driven by buses per year. The district serves most of Ankeny, a very small portion of Polk City, and also a section of the Saylorville census-designated place. History The first school in Ankeny was a log cabin, built in 1850, twenty years before Crocker Township was organized as a civil township. Ankeny's first school was located approximately south of town where the east entrance of the Iowa State Experimental farm joined Highway 69. This school was later re-located on the east side of Ankeny Boulevard, just south of First Street. Records show that Mr. A. H. Feigenbaum was one of the early teachers, serving in one of the one- room schools about 1880. The early roster includes other names such as Mrs. Hattie Cornwall, a Miss Benedict, Miss Maude Kennedy, and Mrs. John Wagner as a substitute. The district's first official \\"graduating class\\" was the five- person class of 1914. Consolidation came to Ankeny in 1919, at which time the oldest part of the Neveln building was built. Several country school houses were moved to the grounds to accommodate the increased enrollment. There was no further new construction until 1952 when the original part of the Parkview building was constructed. In 1957, the west wing was added and in 1964 an east wing was completed. In 1964, Parkview became Ankeny High School. Later, the facility was repurposed and renamed as \\"Parkview Middle School.\\" Northwest Elementary on West 1st Street was the first building to open after the original Parkview building. It was completed in 1962. Additional buildings include (in order of opening): * East Elementary, built in 1963 * Southeast Elementary, opened in 1969 * Terrace Elementary, opened in 1972 * Northview Middle School, originally opened as \\"Ankeny High School\\" in two phases (1973 & 1975) * Westwood Elementary, opened in 1989 * Northeast Elementary, opened in 1992 * Prairie Ridge Middle School, originally opened as \\"Northview Middle School\\" in 1995 * Crocker Elementary, opened in 2004 * Ashland Ridge Elementary, opened in 2008 * Ankeny High School, opened in 2011 * Southview Middle School, opened in 2011 * Prairie Trail Elementary School, opened in 2012 * Ankeny Centennial High School, opened in 2013 * Rock Creek Elementary, opened in 2014 * Heritage Elementary, opened in 2020 In 2009, construction began on the new Ankeny High School in Prairie Trail, and construction on the new Ankeny Centennial High School began with a groundbreaking ceremony on September 1, 2010. In August 2011, the new Ankeny High School opened, along with Phase I of Southview Middle School. At this time, the previous high school became a middle school for 8th and 9th grades. In 2011 the district also experienced its first division on the way to two secondary school systems, by moving to two 6th‚Äì7th grade middle schools: Prairie Ridge Middle School for the north feeder system and Parkview Middle School for the south feeder system. In 2013‚Äì2014 the district opened Ankeny Centennial High School, marking the first time in four decades in which a school district in Iowa expanded to two high schools. The name, \\"Ankeny Centennial High School\\" is in honor of 100 years of graduating classes in Ankeny Community Schools. The Class of 2013 was the 100th graduating class, graduating just three months prior to the opening of the school. At the same time, East Elementary School was expanded to accommodate three sections of students at each grade level (K-5). The district redrew the attendance boundaries of its southern elementary schools in 2019, and began planning for a third high school that same year. Expansion Ankeny Schools has been experiencing a period of rapid enrollment growth, with 300+ new students joining the school district each year. The Ankeny School district opened its second high school in 2013-2014 and now operates two, fully functioning secondary school systems.

Historical Information: Girls' Athletics Ankeny girls' athletics rose to prominence in the late 1970s and early 1980s under Coach Dick Rasmussen, who coached the girls' basketball and softball teams. Under head coach Scott De Jong, the girls' basketball team holds the record for the most consecutive state titles. They won the state championship in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005; in 2005 they rose as high as No. 2 in USA Today's Super 25 national rankings. The Hawkettes hold the record for the most state titles by a school in Iowa history, having won six championships under Coach De Jong in the five- girl era and another three under the old six-girl rules. State Championships The Ankeny girls' track and field team won the state outdoor championship in 1981 under coach Roy Crabtree and has, under head coach Dennis Adamson, won the state indoor championship in 1996 and was runner-up outdoor state champions in 1996 and 1997. The girls' track and field team under coach Adamson has also been in the top ten state finishers seven times most recently finishing seventh in the 2010 season. Under Coach Dave Whims, the Ankeny High School volleyball team has had several state tournament appearances and have won the state championship in 2004, 2005, 2008, and 2009. In 2003, 2004 and 2010 the team was the state 4A runner up. Overall since 1996, the volleyball team has made 10 state tournament appearances and won 9 conference championships.Ankeny Athletic Booster Club Volleyball Records; ACSD Booster Club Web Site . The Ankeny girls' golf team, coached by Toni Dickey, has appeared in the state tournament from 2001 to 2005, 2007 to 2009, and 2011. The team has four championships, 1986, 2003, 2004, and 2008. The 2009 team placed 3rd at the state tournament, and 5th in 2011. The girls have been crowned conference champions in each year from 2001 to 2009, and again in 2011.Ankeny Athletic Booster Club Girls Golf Records; ACSD Booster Club Web Site . The Ankeny girls' soccer team, under the direction of Coach Chris Allen, captured their first state championship in 2011. They also won their second title in 2013, with an undefeated nationally ranked team. In 2015, Ankeny High won their third girls' soccer state championship, this time over Pleasant Valley. Boys' Athletics Ankeny also has a very successful football team. Coach Jerry Pezzetti has accumulated over 370 wins in his 50+ year career at Ankeny including two state championships in 1997 and 2012.Iowa All- Time Football Coaching Leaders; Iowa High School Athletic Association, additional text. Since 1998, and with the help of special teams coach Peter Rameh, four Hawk kickers have played college football for teams in the Division I Bowl Sub-division, including former University of Miami All- American Todd Sievers The Ankeny boys' soccer team is coached by Rick Isaacson, with the assistance of Peter Rameh. The team made its first ever state tournament appearance in 2006, losing in the first round to top seeded Bettendorf. They made the state tournament again in 2007, where they won the state title with a 1‚Äì0 victory over Valley High School after a last-minute goal by Jacob Misel. The baseball team has 10 state tournament appearances, including four state runners-up and two state championships in 1992 and 2012. Alumni Athletic Participation at Higher Levels Ankeny High School alumni have participated in numerous NCAA Division I sports, including football, men's and women's basketball, baseball, women's golf, equestrian, men's and women's track and field, men's and women's swimming, softball, volleyball, men's and women's soccer, men's and women's cross country, and wrestling. Several former Ankeny athletes have achieved high levels of performance at the professional level: * Pat Dunsmore played just one year of high school football, but played well enough to earn a scholarship to Drake and went on to become an All- American receiver. He played three seasons in the NFL as a tight end. He was a member of the Chicago Bears' team that won the Super Bowl in 1985. * Dennis Gibson was a standout linebacker at Ankeny and was a three-year starter at Iowa State. He was an 8th round draft pick by the Detroit Lions in 1987. He helped the Lions to the NFC Championship Game in 1991 and went on to make nearly 500 tackles during his seven seasons in Detroit. He later joined the San Diego Charges in 1994 and played in the Super Bowl that same year. * Benj Sampson pitched the Ankeny baseball team to the Class 4-A state championship in 1992. He elected to turn pro after being selected by the Minnesota Twins in the 6th round of the 1993 amateur draft. Sampson made his major-league debut with the Twins in September 1998. He compiled a 1.56 ERA in five appearances, and earned a spot on Minnesota's opening-day roster in 1999.

They established a blend of religious and secular rule in parts of Yemen from 897. Their imamate endured under varying circumstances until the republican revolution in 1962. Zaidiyyah theology differed from Isma'ili or Twelver Shi'ites by stressing the presence of an active and visible imam as leader. The imam was expected to be knowledgeable in religious scholarship, and to prove himself a worthy headman of the community, even in battle if this was necessary. A claimant of the imamate would proclaim a \\"call\\" (da'wa), and there were not infrequently more than one claimant.Jane Hathaway, A Tale of Two Factions; Myth, Memory, and identity in Ottoman Egypt and Yemen. New York 2003, pp. 79‚Äì81. History Establishment The imams based their legitimacy on descent from the Islamic prophet Muhammad, mostly via al-Qasim ar-Rassi (d. 860). After him, the medieval imams are sometimes known as Rassids. The first of the ruling line, his grandson al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya, was born in Medina. His fame as an intellectual as well as a leader of note, led to his invitation to Yemen. He was summoned to govern the highland tribes in 893 and again in 896‚Äì97. Al- Hadi introduced a multiude of policies and practices that evolved into the particular Yemenite Zaidiyyah brand. The efforts of al-Hadi eventually became the basic guidelines for the religious as well as political characteristics of Yemeni Zaydism. Al-Hadi, however, was not able to consolidate his rule in all of Yemen. He could not even create an enduring state in the highlands, due to the strong localism persisting in the region. There were revolts as well as segments of the population that did not accept his and his successors' pretensions to religio-political rule.Cornelis van Arendonk, Les d√©buts de l'imamat zaidite au Yemen. Leiden 1960 Although he did not succeed in establishing any permanent administrative infrastructure, al-Hadi's descendants, and other Alid clans who arrived in his company, became the local aristocracy of the northern highlands.D. Thomas Gochenour, \\"Towards a sociology of the Islamization of Yemen\\", in B.R. Pridham (ed.), Contemporary Yemen: Politics and historical background, Beckenham 1984, pp. 8‚Äì9. It is from among them that the imams of Yemen were selected for the next one thousand years. The imams were usually chosen from the offspring of al-Qasim ar-Rassi and more specifically of al-Hadi, but on at least eight occasions they were picked from other lines descending from Muhammad's grandsons Hasan and Husain.Enzyklop√§die des Islam, Vol. III, Leiden 1936, p. 1216 Yemen throughout most of that period was only rarely a unified political entity; in fact, what has included within its frontiers varied widely, and it has not been governed consistently or uniformly by any single set of rulers except for brief periods. It existed as a part of a number of different political systems/ruling dynasties between the ninth and sixteenth centuries, after which it became a part of the Ottoman Empire. Rivalries with other dynasties After Imam al-Hadi's death in 911, his sons took over the imamate in turn, although it was not hereditary but rather elective among the descendants of Muhammad. From the 11th to the early 17th centuries, however, the imams were usually not chosen from the sons of the former imam, but the title rather circulated among the various Rassid branches. Meanwhile, a multitude of smaller dynasties and families established themselves in the highlands, as well as in Tihama (the low coastal plain) where the imams rarely gained influence. Among the better known of these are the Yu'firids (847‚Äì997), the Najahids (1021‚Äì1158), the Sulayhids (1047‚Äì1138), the Zuray'ids (1080‚Äì1174), and the Hatimids (1098‚Äì1174).H.C. Kay, Yaman: Its early medieval history. London 1892, https://archive.org/stream/yamanitsearlymed00umaruoft/yamanitsearlymed00umaruoft_djvu.txt It was during this period, when the Fatimid state was influential, that a portion of the population was converted to Ismailism. Beginning with the conquest of Yemen by the family of Salah ad-Din ibn Ayyub (Saladin) in 1174, a series of dynasties exercised a modicum of control and administration in Yemen for roughly the next 400 years; these are, in chronological sequence, the Ayyubids, from 1174 to 1229; the Rasulids, from 1229 to 1454; the Tahirids, from 1454 to 1517; and the Mamluks, from 1517 to 1538, when the Ottoman Empire took the Yemeni Tihama.For the chronology of these, see Peter Truhart, Regents of nations, Vol. 3, M√ºnchen 2003, pp. 1090‚Äì1. During most of this period, the dynasties and their rulers were primarily engaged in familial, regional, and occasionally sectarian disputes. Ironically, the Sunni Rasulids, who eventually concentrated their rule in southern Yemen for precisely that reason, were the dynasty under which the region experienced the greatest economic growth and political stability.Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. VIII, Leiden 1995, pp. 455‚Äì7. For part of the medieval era the Zaydiyyah imams were eclipsed by the lowland dynasties, and for long periods there would be no imam at all (especially in 1066‚Äì1138 and 1171‚Äì1187). From the end of the thirteenth century the political fortunes of the Zaydiyya imams revived somewhat. They were able to hold their own against the Rasulids and Tahirids and sometimes expand their territory. Often however, and especially after 1436, the imamate was split between several contenders. Comparatively little is known about the medieval Zaydi imams and their efforts to establish themselves and develop some form of administration (including tax collection), or their success in promoting Zaydi goals during this period. From the available evidence, there was very little continuity and a great deal of competition among the Zaydi families and clans. For example, in a presumably representative two-hundred- year period from the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries, there appear to have been more than twenty different candidates for the imamate, representing more than ten distinct clans.Robert W. Stookey, Yemen: The politics of the Yemen Arab Republic, Boulder 1978, p. 125. The Qasimid state Eventually, the Europeans entered the Middle East, specifically the Portuguese and then others, in the effort to control the Red Sea trade. For the Zaydiyya imams, however, the Ottomans constituted the greater external threat. Ottoman expeditions managed to defeat the highland tribesmen in the mid decades of the sixteenth century. From the early 17th century al-Mansur al-Qasim, belonging to one of the Rassid branches (later known as the Qasimids or Yemeni Zaidi State), raised the standard of rebellion. His son al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad managed to gather the entire Yemen under his authority, expel the Turks, and establish an independent political entity. For a time, the imams ruled a comprehensive territory, including South Yemen and areas even further to the east. Their economic base was strengthened by the coffee trade of the coastal entrepot Mocha. Unlike in the previous practice, the Qasimids or Yemeni Zaidi State ruled as a hereditary dynasty.For their genealogy, see Robert W. Stookey, Yemen: The politics of the Yemen Arab Republic, Boulder 1978, p. 144. The power of the Yemeni Zaidi State or Imamate declined in the 18th and 19th century, especially in the wake of the Wahhabi invasions after 1800.Robert L. Playfair, A History of Arabia Felix or Yemen. Bombay 1859, pp. 127‚Äì34. The territory controlled by the imams shrank successively after 1681, and the lucrative coffee trade declined with new producers in other parts of the world. The Qasimid state or Yemeni Zaidi State has been characterized as a \\"quasi-state\\" with an inherent tension between tribes and government, and between tribal culture and learned Islamic morality. The imams themselves adopted the style of Middle East monarchies, becoming increasingly distant figures. As a result, they eventually lost their charismatic and spiritual position among the tribes of Yemen.Vincent Steven Wilhite, Guerilla war, counterinsurgency, and state formation in Ottoman Yemen, PhD Thesis, Ohio State University 2003, p. 130. The imamate was further eclipsed by the second coming of the Turks to lowland Yemen in 1848, and to the highlands in 1872. However, the Ottoman troops were never able to entirely quell resistance against Ottoman rule. The occupants were eventually driven out by 1918, by a Qasimid side-branch which inaugurated the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen. Modern history For the next 44 years North Yemen was ruled by two powerful imams. Yahya bin Muhammad Hamid ad-Din and his son Ahmad bin Yahya created a kingdom there much as the kings of England and France had done centuries earlier. The two imams strengthened the state and secured its borders. They used the imamate to insulate Yemen and revitalize its Islamic culture and society at a time when traditional societies around the world were declining under imperial rule. While Yemen under the two imams seemed almost frozen in time, a small but increasing number of Yemenis became aware of the contrast between an autocratic society they saw as stagnant and the political and economic modernization occurring in other parts of the world. This produced an important chain of events: the birth of the nationalist Free Yemeni Movement in the mid-1940s, an aborted 1948 revolution in which Imam Yahya was killed, a failed 1955 coup against Imam Ahmad, and finally, the 1962 revolution in which the recently enthroned imam Muhammad al-Badr was deposed by a group of nationalist officers and the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) was proclaimed under the leadership of Abdullah al-Sallal.Paul Dresch, A history of modern Yemen, pp. 28‚Äì95, http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam031/00029266.pdf The first five years of President Al-Sallal's rule, from 1962 to 1967, comprised the first chapter in the history of North Yemen. Marked by the revolution that began it, this period witnessed a lengthy civil war between Yemeni republican forces, based in the cities and supported by Egypt, and the royalist supporters of the deposed imam, backed by Saudi Arabia and Jordan. In 1965 Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser met with King Faisal of Saudi Arabia to consider a possible settlement to the civil war. The meeting resulted in an agreement whereby both countries pledged to end their involvement and allow the people of North Yemen to choose their own government. Subsequent peace conferences were ineffectual, however, and fighting flared up again in 1966.http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/yemen.htm By 1967 the war had reached a stalemate, and the republicans had split into opposing factions concerning relations with Egypt and Saudi Arabia. In late 1967 Al- Sallal‚Äôs government was overthrown and he was replaced as president by Abdul Rahman al-Iryani. Fighting continued until 1970, when Saudi Arabia halted its aid to royalists and established diplomatic ties with North Yemen. Al-Iryani effected the long-sought truce between republican and royalist forces, and presided over the adoption of a democratic constitution in 1970. Imam Muhammad al-Badr, greatly disappointed by the Saudi recognition of the republic, emigrated to London where he died in 1996.http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/History/Yemen-history.htm In June 1974 military officers led by Colonel Ibrahim al-Hamdi staged a bloodless coup, claiming that the government of Al-Iryani had become ineffective. The constitution was suspended, and executive power was vested in a command council, dominated by the military. Al-Hamdi chaired the council and attempted to strengthen and restructure politics in North Yemen. Al-Hamdi was assassinated in 1977, and his successor, former Chief of Staff Ahmed Hussein al-Ghashmi, was killed in June 1978.Robert W. Stookey, Yemen: The Politics of the Yemen Arab Republic. Boulder 1978, gives a general outline of the history up to the late 1970s. The lengthy tenure of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who ruled North Yemen from 1978 until it merged with South Yemen in 1990, proved more stable. Saleh strengthened the political system, while an influx of foreign aid and the discovery of oil in North Yemen held out the prospect of economic expansion and development.

It was built from 1852‚Äì1855 on the site of an earlier building known as Kealakekua Church that was built around 1833 in the Kona district. History English missionary William Ellis (1794‚Äì1872) toured the island in the summer of 1823 to determine locations for mission stations and suggested the village of Kaawaloa at the north end of Kealakekua Bay as one of the first sites for a church. Samuel Ruggles, pastor in 1828 Cochran Forbes built 1839 church John D. Paris built Kahikolu church Henry Obookiah, credited with bringing Christianity to Hawai'i, was reinterred from his Connecticut grave to Kahikolu Church in 1993. In February 1824 High Chiefess Kapiolani built a thatched house in the village of Kaawaloa for use as a Christian church by Rev. James Ely (1798‚Äì1890) and his family. Ely left Kaawaloa in 1828, replaced by Rev. Samuel Ruggles (1795‚Äì1871), who brought some coffee trees with him from the Hilo mission. Ruggles was replaced due to ill health in June 1833 by Rev. Cochran Forbes (1805‚Äì1880). Forbes built a house at a cooler elevation, at a site called Kuapehu which had been used to grow taro. In 1839, under the direction of Kapiolani, Forbes moved the mission to the south side of Kealakekua Bay, in an area called Kepulu, just inland from the village now called NƒÅpoopoo. Another house was built here, and a church which was by of stone and coral lime. In 1841 the Kealakekua Church was finished, and used until June 1845, when Forbes resigned because of his wife's ill health. After six years with no pastor, Rev. John Davis Paris (1809‚Äì1892) arrived in 1852. His family had been at Wai≈çhinu for several years, returned to the United States, and then came back to the island and were posted to the Kealakekua congregation. He found the large old church in ruins. He set about building a more solid but smaller stone church called Kahikolu on the site of the old one. Kahikolu means \\"three in one\\" in the Hawaiian language, which refers both to the Holy Trinity of the Christian faith, but also that it was the third attempt to build a church here. The width of the old church became the length of the new one, resulting in a building about by , with walls thick. Kahikolu took three years to build, and included a bell donated by William E. Dodge of New York. It could hold a total of about 1200 people. Paris went on to build eight more churches (including Hale Halawai O Holualoa), and died in the area in 1892. There are grave sites located on both sides of the church, some of which are unmarked. Several bear the name of \\"Kamakau\\", probably descendants of a chief Kelou Kamakau, born about 1773 who was mentioned in Ellis' journal as a good source of history. Decline and restoration In 1925 a layer of plaster was added to the inside walls, and the ceiling and floor replaced. In 1929, an earthquake caused one of the gable ends to tumble into the church. They were replaced with horizontal wood strips. Once the largest church on the west side of the island, its influence declined as population moved to other areas. On August 21, 1951, an earthquake with magnitude 6.9 was centered almost under the church. The roof collapsed after more earthquakes in 1952 and 1953. The stone church was abandoned in 1953 due to the damage. Kahikolu church was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii on November 15, 1982 as site 82000148, and the state list as site 10-47-7215 on July 30, 1982. The only other stone church from this era on the island is Mokuaikaua Church, about to the north. P A rebuilding effort lasted through the 1980s. Kahikolu Church restoration was completed around 1984. In 1993, the body of one of the first native Hawaiians to become a Christian, Henry ≈åp≈´kaha\`ia', was reinterred at Kahikolu Church. ≈åp≈´kaha\`ia' is credited (or blamed, depending on the speaker's perspective) with starting Hawaii's conversion to Christianity and had travelled from Hawai'i's Big Island by way of Connecticut to Yale University in 1809 where he studied English and Christianity and planned to return to Hawaii himself to preach. He contracted typhus fever and died in 1818 in Cornwall at the age of 26. \`≈åp≈´kaha\`ia's family decided to return his body from his grave in Connecticut to Hawaii. On Aug. 15, 1993, his remains were laid in a vault facing the sea at Kahikolu Church. It was the third church established in Hawaii by missionaries inspired by Opukaha ªia. Hawaii's churches observe the third Sunday in February as a day of commemoration in honor of its first Christian. A plaque at the Cornwall gravesite reads: \\"In July of 1993, the family of Henry Opukahaia took him home to Hawaii for interment at Kahikolu Congregational Church Cemetery, Napo'opo'o, Kona, Island of Hawaii. Henry's family expresses gratitude, appreciation and love to all who cared for and loved him throughout the past years. Ahahui O Opukahaia\\". The church was finally restored and opened again for use in 1999. A historical marker was added in 2003. The address of the congregation is 82-5931 Napo'opo'o Road, Captain Cook, Hawaii 96704. Sunday services are held at 9:30 AM with Sunday School at 8:30. The pastor (as of July 2011) is Wendell Davis. In November 2003, under the urging of pastor Davis, Kahikolu Congregational Church voted to disaffiliate from the United Church of Christ because of the UCC \\"open and affirming\\" ordination of practising gay and lesbian pastors. The members were considering leaving the UCC but have not actually done so as of 2013. The variety of coffee Ruggles brought in 1828 thrived in the part of the island around Kealakekua, called the Kona District. Because it was the first coffee grown on the western side of the island, it is often referred to as the first Kona coffee, still popular today.

The initiator should dissolve in the monomer. The reaction is initiated by heating or exposing to radiation. As the reaction proceeds the mixture becomes more viscous. The reaction is exothermic and a wide range of molecular masses are produced. Bulk polymerization is carried out in the absence of any solvent or dispersant and is thus the simplest in terms of formulation. It is used for most step-growth polymers and many types of chain-growth polymers. In the case of chain-growth reactions, which are generally exothermic, the heat evolved may cause the reaction to become too vigorous and difficult to control unless efficient cooling is used. Bulk polymerization has several advantages over other methods, these advantages are : * The system is simple and requires thermal insulation. * The polymer obtained is pure. * Large castings may be prepared directly. * Molecular weight distribution can be easily changed * The product obtained has high optical clarity Disadvantages : * Heat transfer and mixing become difficult as the viscosity of reaction mass increases. * The problem of heat transfer is compounded by the highly exothermic nature of free radical addition polymerization. * The polymerization is obtained with a broad molecular weight distribution due to the high viscosity and lack of good heat transfer. * Very high molecular weights are obtained. * Gel effect. For reducing the disadvantages of bulk polymerization, the process can be carried out in a solution. This is known as solution polymerization. \\"PREDICTION OF MASS TRANSPORT OF SOLVENT / POLYMER SYSTEMS IN HIGH VOLUME KNEADER REACTORS AT FINITE SOLVENT CONCENTRATIONS\\", by Dr. Daniel U.

The Oxford Handbook of Biblical Studies describes it as \\"the oldest example of a book in a West Semitic language written with an alphabet, and the oldest piece of Aramaic literature.\\" Though containing some features of Aramaic, such as the word bar \\"(son of [Beor])\\" rather than the Canaanite ben, it also has many elements of Canaanite languages, leading some to believe it was written in a dialect of Canaanite rather than an early form of Aramaic. The inscription has been dated to 880‚Äì770 BCE. It was painted in ink on fragments of a plastered wall; red and black inks were used, red apparently to emphasize certain parts of the text. In all, 119 pieces of ink- inscribed plaster were recovered. The wall, near the summit of the tel, was felled by a tremor.J.

He developed steam turbines and turbine-driven locomotives and patented the geothermal heat pump in 1912.  Life and work  Heinrich Zoelly was the fifth child of Franz Xaver Zoelly. His father, originally from Switzerland near Klettgau, had emigrated to Mexico to seek better fortune. Heinrich was born in Mexico and received the Mexican citizenship. His father ran a hat factory in Mexico City with his brother John. When Henry was still a child, his father left Mexico because of political unrest and returned to Switzerland. There, Henry attended primary school, skipping two grades before starting at the Federal Polytechnic Institute (which later became ETH Zurich). He was just 20 years old when he earned his degree in mechanical engineering. After study trips to Mexico and Paris, Heinrich Zoelly went back to Switzerland in 1886. Two years later Zoelly applied in Fluntern for naturalization and became a Swiss citizen. Heinrich Zoelly was married and had five children. In 1886 Zoelly entered the service of Zurich's Maschinenfabrik Escher Wyss & Cie. He quickly became its technical director at the young age of 26. Thanks to him, the company flourished, which at this time manufactured various steam engines, water turbines, locomotives, traction engines and vessels. His most significant development was the construction of a multi- stage steam turbine, initially used in water turbines. In 1903 Zoelly developed a multi-stage axial flow impulse turbine in collaboration with Professor Stodola. Despite low vapor pressure (11 bar) and low temperature (185 ¬∞C), this achieved a considerable output of 370 kW and a thermodynamic efficiency of 62%. The original of the first machine of this type is now at the Deutsches Museum. This turbine competed with other steam turbines developed about the same time in the world (Parsons, rake, plate, Curtis, Laval, and others) and was distributed worldwide through licensing. In 1912 Zoelly was awarded an honorary degree from the ETH Zurich, partly thanks to his work in turbine development. Since Zoelly was convinced of the superiority of the steam turbine to the steam piston engine, in 1913 Escher Wyss & Cie. abandoned the production of steam engines and concentrated fully on turbines. Zoelly's vision also extended to steam locomotives (which traditionally used piston engines) using steam turbines as drive. Until his resignation from Escher-Wyss Zoelly devoted himself to the development of a steam turbine- driven locomotive, which he drove forward to serviceability (1926 Zoelly- SLM), and later in 1930 Krupp Zoelly). Since diesel and electric power was increasing, the steam locomotive lost its significance. Zoelly died in 1937 in his adopted hometown of Zurich.

In June 2009 she was sold by her original owner, the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, to Alshair Fiyaz by yacht brokers Merle Wood. Design Ordered by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, Ecstasea was built in 2004 as the largest Feadship ever built. The yacht was built in the shipyard of Royal Van Lent and has length of , and a beam of , with a deadweight of 585 metric tons. The yacht is made of all steel, and is much closer to a luxury ship, than to a yacht. Her exterior design was created by the teamwork of Terence Disdale and De Voogt Naval Architects, with Disdale also responsible for the yacht's Asian-style interior. David Waite-Wright, who was Senior Designer at Disdales, oversaw the project. The yacht later went on to win multiple interior design awards. She has capacity for 14 passengers, who are divided into 6 separate rooms.  Engine  The yacht has four main MTU engines with a combined power of 12,444 hp. The builder also installed a General Electric LM2500 gas turbine on board, which produces 30,843 hp. The total combined horsepower of 43,287 hp allows the yacht to reach a maximum speed of more than 30 knots. The maximum speed with only the diesel engines working is 25 knots. The cruising speed (diesel only) is 22 knots.  Incidents  On December 15, 2019, Ecstasea clipped the Simpson Bay Bridge, St. Maarten. The yacht sustained minor hull damage, but a small operation room attached to the bridge was destroyed and fell into the bay. This incident was captured on video and posted to Reddit. It is estimated that the vessel was traveling at less than 3 knots. The St. Maarten Daily Herald reported that this was not the first time the booth has been damaged by incoming vessels.

Examples * saying that a taunt or insult was only a joke * a customer receiving a response to a complaint to a company for poor service being told that complaints like his from other customers were very rare when in fact they are common * suggesting that there are just a few bad apples or rogues in an organisation when in reality problems are widespread and systemic * Your boss may redirect you instead of rejecting you in a subtle way (with or without factual evidence) School bullying sometimes minimised as a prank School bullying is one form of victimisation or physical abuse which has sometimes been unofficially encouraged, ritualised or even minimised as a sort of prank by teachers or peers. The main difference between pranks and bullying is establishment of power inequity between the bully and the victim that lasts beyond the duration of the act. Understatements Understatement is a form of speech which contains an expression of less strength than what would be expected. Understatement is a staple of humour in English-speaking cultures, especially in British humour. In this humorous form, the understatement is expected to not be interpreted literally. Related but separate is euphemism, where a polite phrase is used in place of a harsher or more offensive expression.Euphemism Webster's Online Dictionary. Self-esteem/depression Redefining events to downplay their significance can be an effective way of preserving one's self-esteem.E. R. Smith/D. M. Mackie, Social Psychology (Hove 2007) p. 136-9 One of the problems of depression (found in those with clinical, bipolar, and chronic depressive mood disorders, as well as cyclothymia) is the tendency to do the reverse: minimising the positive, discounting praise,Paul Gilbert, Overcoming Depression (London 1999) p. 63 and p. 98 and dismissing one's own accomplishments.Jacqui Lee Schiff, Cathexis Reader (New York 1975) p. 84-5 On the other hand, one technique used by Alfred Adler to combat neurosis was to minimise the excessive significance the neurotic attaches to his own symptomsAlfred Adler, Superiority and Social Interest (1964) p. 192‚Äîthe narcissistic gains derived from pride in one's own illness.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946) p. 462 Social minimisation Display rules expressing a group's general consensus about the display of feeling often involve minimising the amount of emotion one displays, as with a poker face.Daniel Goleman, Emotional Intelligence (London 1995) p. 113 Social interchanges involving minor infringements often end with the 'victim' minimising the offence with a comment like 'Think nothing of it',Erving Goffman, Relations in Public (1972) p. 177 using so-called 'reduction words',Robert Hoyk/Paul Hersey, The Ethical Executive (2008) p. 68-9 such as 'no big deal,' 'only a little,' 'merely,' or 'just', the latter particularly useful in denying intent.N. Symington, Narcissism' (1990) p. 116 On a wider scale, renaming things in a more benign or neutral form‚Äî'collateral damage' for death‚Äîis a form of minimisation. Literary analogues A scene in the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail involving the Black Knight character, demonstrates an absurd level of minimisation. For example, the knight's response to his having his left arm severed is \\"It's just a flesh wound.\\" Compare with the Monty Python Dirty Fork sketch, which is the opposite extreme of absurdity (catastrophisation).

It is a legendary Pok√©mon. Rayquaza is the version mascot of Pok√©mon Emerald. It is also the master of the Weather Trio, which contains Kyogre, Groudon and itself. It is known for being one of the strongest Pok√©mon in the franchise, since it is able to Mega Evolve and hold an item at the same time. This, together with the fact that Mega Rayquaza has the highest base stat total of all Pok√©mon (tied with Mewtwo's mega evolutions), led to it being the only Pok√©mon to be banned from the community-selected Uber tier. The Sky High Pok√©mon, Rayquaza is an atmospheric beast that spends the majority of its time flying above the clouds in the ozone layer and appears as a meteor to those on the ground. Rayquaza has a special connection to the process of Mega Evolution; In Pok√©mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, it is revealed to canonically be the first Pok√©mon to have undergone Mega Evolution and Mega Rayquaza is the only such form to not require a held Mega Stone before its transformation. Concept and characteristics As with all Rayquaza introduced in Pok√©mon Rayquaza, Rayquaza was designed by Ken Sugimori with the help of his development team. The name \\"Rayquaza\\" comes from a combination of the words ray and quasar. Rayquaza resembles a japanese dragon. it is based on the Japanese dragon and you can find the Japanese dragons name Ryu in its name Rayquaza has an elongated, green serpentine body with yellow oval patterns. Red-tipped fins extend from its body and additional appendages lengthen from its serpentine head. Rayquaza has sharp, conical teeth, some of which appear to be covered by gum tissue similar to a Komodo dragon's. It lacks back legs, but has two arms with three white claws. Its tail is tipped with two small red-edged fins. Upon Mega Evolution, Mega Rayquaza's body lengthens further, and is marked with black bands. Its horns become more prominently V-shaped and its head longer, with the delta symbol visible on its forehead. Glowing gold and orange barabels stream from its two horn tips and both sides of its head, with the latter two tendrils ending in small, fin-like green structures. Mega Rayquaza's lower jaw juts out in spiked protrusions far past its eyes, whose gold pupils and red irises sit at the head of black marks streaking to its neck. Flame-like projections burn from its jaw. Golden orbs replace the rings lining its body, and yellow ribbon-like extensions connect to the base of its tail. > Rayquaza eats water and meteor particles from the sky where it lives, and > only descends when it wants to rest or if its fellow weather Pok√©mon, Kyogre > and Groudon engage in combat.*{{pok√©dex|emerald|It is said it would descend > to the ground if Kyogre and Groudon were to fight.

Until recently, no one had ever seen it. Appearances In video games Rayquaza first appeared in the Pok√©mon Ruby and Sapphire games (The Pok√©mon games that take place in the Hoenn region), where it could be located on the top of the Sky Pillar. The player has only one chance to battle and capture Rayquaza; the Pok√©mon will disappear upon fainting. Rayquaza also serves as the main mascot Legendary Pok√©mon of Pok√©mon Emerald, and appears on the cover of the game. In Pok√©mon Emerald, Rayquaza aids the player in stopping Team Magma and Team Aqua from harnessing the power of Kyogre and Groudon to rule the world. The game also focuses on attempts by these two factions to control Rayquaza, and thus the sky. In Pok√©mon HeartGold and Pok√©mon SoulSilver, the player is able to find Rayquaza at the Embedded Tower after catching Groudon and Kyogre and showing them to the Pok√©mon researcher Professor Oak (Note that Groudon is exclusive to Pok√©mon SoulSilver and Kyogre is exclusive to Pok√©mon HeartGold). Both Pok√©mon must be caught in the Embedded Tower, a location in the two games, so trading with a copy of the other game is required. In Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, it can be encountered by having both Groudon and Kyogre in the player's party. The Delta Episode of Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire introduces Rayquaza's Mega Evolution. The episode's lore reveals that Mega Evolution occurred for the first time after Rayquaza descended from the sky to quell fighting between Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre; Rayquaza transformed in response to the wishes for protection from the people of the Hoenn region, doing so near to a glowing meteorite filled with \\"natural energy\\". Due to the power within the meteorites it has consumed, it only has to have its new signature move, Dragon Ascent, learned to Mega Evolve instead of needing to hold a Mega Stone. After Rayquaza consumes the player's Meteorite and is caught, the player's fervent wish reaches it, and it can once again transform into Mega Rayquaza. The player rides it into outer space in this form, where it destroys a massive inbound meteorite in order to save the planet. Mega Rayquaza has the tied-for highest combined Attack and Special Attack stats of any Pok√©mon, as well as a signature ability in Delta Stream, which suppresses all weather conditions (unless the ability of Primal Groudon or of Primal Kyogre activates afterward) through strong winds that protect Flying-type Pok√©mon from the type's weaknesses. Rayquaza appears in many spin-off games. In Pok√©mon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire, Rayquaza is the focus of the third and final Bonus Field. In Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, Rayquaza acts as the final boss, living on the Sky Tower. After it is defeated, Rayquaza helps save the world from a meteor. After the credits roll, the player can re- battle Rayquaza to recruit it. In Pok√©mon Ranger, Rayquaza can be captured in a bonus mission after the credits. In Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness, Rayquaza is the guardian of the Sky Melodica. In Pok√©Park Wii: Pikachu's Adventure, Rayquaza is the host of a mini-game called \\"Balloon Panic\\". In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Rayquaza shoots down Fox McCloud's Arwing and then attacks both Fox and Diddy Kong; it serves as a boss, trophy, and sticker within the game. A shiny Rayquaza is found in Pok√©mon Conquest in the possession of Oda Nobunaga. It appears in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS and Wii U as a stage hazard and as a trophy. It also appears in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a spirit. In other media Rayquaza first appears in the film Pok√©mon: Destiny Deoxys, where it battles Deoxys, believing it is invading the Earth. Eventually, Ash Ketchum must save Rayquaza; after Rayquaza is saved, it decides that Deoxys is not a threat, and returns to the atmosphere. It has also appeared briefly in two episodes of the Pok√©mon anime and also got a major role in Pok√©mon the Movie: Hoopa and the Clash of Ages. Rayquaza is featured on 33 cards of the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game in many rare iterations, such as Rayquaza & Deoxys Legend, Mega Rayquaza EX, Shining and GX. In the Pok√©mon Adventures manga, five years prior to the plot, Ruby accidentally released Rayquaza from a lab. Ruby's dad Norman was tasked with tracking it down. After many years of tracking, he was able to, with Wally's help, awaken and take command of Rayquaza, using it to calm Groudon and Kyogre in conjunction with Ruby's Red and Blue Orbs. When Norman fell under the strain of controlling Rayquaza without a proper medium, it escaped once again, and has not been seen since. Merchandising Rayquaza was featured in a line of Subway restaurant promotional toys, where it decorated the handle of a flying disc called the \\"Rayquaza Disc\\". Rayquaza and Mega Rayquaza have also been featured in several plush toys. Nintendo released a version of the Game Boy Advance SP inspired by Rayquaza, with a green color and pictures of the Pok√©mon on the cover, in order to promote the release of Pok√©mon Emerald. In 2005, the Japanese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications released a postage stamp featuring Rayquaza on it. Reception Prior to the release of Ruby and Sapphire, some criticized the design of Rayquaza as nothing more than that of a rehashed Digimon. Rayquaza, along with fellow legendary Pok√©mon Dialga, have been cited as examples of a falling quality in Pok√©mon design, with one reporter remarking \\"Rayquaza may seem robotic\\" but that it still \\"maintain[s] the concept or idea that Pok√©mon created\\". Grey School of Wizardry faculty member Ash DeKirk describes Rayquaza as a giant serpent dragon with Meso-American traits. In 2005, the year Pok√©mon Emerald came out with Rayquaza as the mascot, search engine Yahoo! reported Rayquaza as one of the top Pok√©mon-related web searches. It was ranked 11th in Complexs The \\"25 Most Kickass Dragons in Video Games\\" list, with writer Obi Anyawu praising its role as peacemaker, which is unusual for a dragon character, a villain in many fairytales. Raymond Padilla of GamesRadar, however, was critical of its portrayal in Pok√©mon: Destiny Deoxys, calling it a frightening character whose actions near the end of the film border on the ridiculous. Padilla had earlier criticized other aspects of the character, including its name, which he claimed was more reminiscent of a member of the hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan than of a Pok√©mon. Mega Rayquaza's power and appearance were well-received, with reviewers claiming \\"it‚Äôs safe to assume that badass is on its resume\\" upon its introduction. Its extreme strength in competitive play, though, eventually drew concern that it was \\"kind of overpowered.\\" It became the first Pok√©mon to be banned from the community- selected \\"Uber tier\\", and has been banned in many official Pok√©mon competitions as well as in \\"The Battle Spot\\" in many Pok√©mon video games.

The set utilizes new oversized Plane cards, cards that are based on various locations (Planes) within the Magic multiverse, to modify the rules of gameplay. Gameplay To play a game of Planechase, each player needs his or her own planar deck, consisting of at least 10 different oversized cards. The players may also use a \\"shared planar deck,\\" which requires ten cards per player. Players cannot use more than one plane with any given name. When the game begins, the player going first reveals the top of his or her planar deck (or the shared planar deck), which is the plane the game starts on. Each plane card has a name, a type, one ability that applies at all times (either to all players or to whoever is the turn player at the time), and one \\"Chaos\\" ability. Players also need a six- sided die, called the \\"planar die.\\" Each Planechase preconstructed deck comes with a \\"planar die\\" that has four blank faces, one \\"Planeswalk\\" face with the \\"Planeswalker\\" symbol, and one \\"Chaos\\" face with its own symbol unique to Planechase. During a player's main phase, that player can roll the planar die, with three possible outcomes. A blank roll of the planar die does nothing. If \\"Chaos\\" is rolled, the \\"Chaos\\" ability of the current plane card triggers. If the \\"planeswalk\\" symbol is rolled, the player \\"planeswalks away\\" from the current plane (put it on the bottom of its owner's planar deck) and he or she reveals the top card of his or her planar deck, which becomes the new plane that has been \\"planeswalked to.\\" A player can roll the planar die as many times as he or she likes, but successive rolls cost an additional one mana for each time the planar die has been rolled this turn. Other than the above, the normal rules of the game are followed, and Planechase can be adapted to any multiplayer variant. Planechase 2012 introduced the \\"phenomenon\\" card type. A player may have up to two different phenomenon cards in his or her planar deck, which cannot have the same name. When a player planeswalks to a phenomenon, he or she follows the instructions on the card, then immediately planeswalks away from it. 2009 release Four game packs were released on September 4, 2009: \\"Elemental Thunder\\", \\"Metallic Dreams\\", \\"Strike Force\\", and \\"Zombie Empire\\". Each game pack comes with a 60-card preconstructed deck, 10 plane cards, a planar die, and multi-player rules. The cards within each preconstructed deck are all reprints from various Magic sets (except for one card in each deck which was a \\"pre-print\\" from the upcoming Zendikar expansion). All of the cards are black bordered and tournament legal in their original formats. 2012 release Four new Planechase game packs were released on June 1, 2012. Each comes with a 60-card preconstructed deck, 8 all-new plane cards, two phenomenon cards, a planar die, and multi-player rules. Unlike the original Planechase release, these decks contain 21 new cards spread among them. Each of the new decks highlights a returning mechanic from Magic's history. * \\"Chaos Reigns\\" is a five-color deck built around cascade, from Alara Reborn. * \\"Night of the Ninja\\" is a blue-black deck built around Ninjas and ninjutsu, from Betrayers of Kamigawa. * \\"Primordial Hunger\\" is a red-green deck built around devour, from Shards of Alara. * \\"Savage Auras\\" is a green-white deck built around Auras and totem armor, from Rise of the Eldrazi.

He had been sentenced to death on 10 September 1959 by the Deputy Bailiff of Jersey for the murder of John Perr√©e on the night of 30 March 1959. Murder of John Perr√©e John Perr√©e, a 45-year-old unmarried labourer from St Brelade, Jersey, was reported missing on 31 March 1959 after having spent the previous evening drinking with Francis Huchet. His body was recovered from a shallow grave on the sand dunes near Mont √† la Brune (near St Brelade) on 4 April 1959. The body had been discovered by a young brother and sister, Alan and Ann Heath, who saw a shoe projecting from the sand. It became clear that Perr√©e had been shot in the face with a single blast from a shotgun. Once he had been identified, his movements were traced and this led to Huchet who was questioned on 5 April. Huchet admitted drinking with Perr√©e on the Monday night but told police that he had dropped him off at the traffic lights at Red Houses, after having gone with him to La Pulente Hotel. This was disputed by witnesses, including the landlord, John Callichan, who said that they had seen the two men leave the Horse and Hounds pub and drive off together in Huchet‚Äôs Hillman car. Police discovered a number of pieces of rope near the crime scene and these matched further pieces found in Huchet‚Äôs car. A woman‚Äôs coat and two pairs of jeans found at the scene were traced back to Huchet‚Äôs wife. Furthermore, tracks in the sand at the crime scene pointed to an attempt to free Huchet‚Äôs car after it had become bogged down in the dunes. From tyre tracks at the scene it appeared that the car had got stuck in sand and had had to be pulled out by another vehicle. When the murder weapon was discovered it contained traces of sand. Trial Huchet was tried at St. Helier from 7 to 10 September before the Deputy Bailiff, Cecil Harrison. 44 witnesses were called, and for the first time in a Jersey murder trial women sat on the 24-strong jury. Witnesses testified that Perr√©e had been carrying a wallet containing a considerable amount of money on the night of his death. Additionally, the jury were presented with damning forensic evidence which tied Huchet to the crime scene. Finally, Deputy Bailiff Harrison ruled that a bogus confession to the crime (written on the flyleaf of a book and smuggled out of Newgate Street Prison, where Huchet was being held) should be admitted into evidence. The bogus confession (which claimed that the murder had been committed by two men named Jim and Tom) had been accompanied by a covering note, written in Huchet's handwriting and addressed to a Mrs. Grace Kemp, which requested that the ‚Äòconfession‚Äô be copied out in ink and forwarded anonymously to the police. Mrs. Kemp instead took the documents to the investigating officers; both items were subsequently shown to the jury, helping to seal Huchet‚Äôs fate. On 10 September 1959, after deliberating for 85 minutes, the 24 members of the jury returned a unanimous verdict of guilty. The guilty verdict immediately resulted in Huchet receiving a death sentence, because the law allowed for no other penalty. Execution Huchet was hanged on the gallows at Newgate Street Prison, Saint Helier at 7.30 am on 9 October 1959. Harry Allen and two assistants (including Royston Rickard) carried out the execution in the presence of the prison governor, F.J. Moon, Deputy Keith Baal (president of the Prison Board) and other prison officers. An inquest was held at 8.30 am at the General Hospital, during which Dr P. G. Bentlif (prison medical officer) stated that in his opinion death had been instantaneous. A crowd of some 100 people congregated outside the prison and were allegedly disappointed when no notice of execution was posted. It was the first civil execution in Jersey for over 52 years and only the second execution in Jersey in the 20th century (excluding executions carried out by the German occupying forces in Jersey during the Second World War). All further death sentences in Jersey were commuted to life imprisonment until 1986, when the death penalty was abolished.

There were multiple reasons why certain clergy members chose to take this course of action. Some hoped to provide services to the government in exchange for a reversal of policies persecuting Christians. Others wished to buy favors from the authorities in order to advance their own careers, since the authorities could influence promotions within the Church hierarchies. Finally, there are claims that some clergy members were secret service agents from the beginning, working undercover. Czechoslovakia The association of Catholic Clergy Pacem in Terris was a regime-sponsored organisation of Catholic clergy in the communist Czechoslovakia between 1971 and 1989. Its name was taken from the well-known encyclical Pacem in terris of Pope John XXIII. SKD PiT was registered on August 1, 1971 and its stated purposes were 'peace in the world' and 'friendship between nations'. But in fact its raison d'etre was rather to control and spy the clergy and influence the life of the whole church. Its founding assembly was held in Prague on August 31, 1971. Poland On 20 December 2006, journalists found documents from the communist archives according to which Archbishop Wielgus collaborated‚Äîor at least conversed‚Äîwith the communist Secret Police during communist rule in Poland. This development was considered to be particularly significant in the context of post-communist Polish politics because public figures, particularly politicians, can be officially censured and barred from holding public office if found to have collaborated with the Security Services (Polish: S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa) of the People's Republic of Poland (Polish: PRL, Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa). The process of review of the Security Service's files, known in Poland as Lustration (Pol: Lustracja) has been the source of many political scandals in recent years. The Polish human rights ombudsman, Janusz Kochanowski, said on January 4, 2007, that there was evidence in the secret police archives that Archbishop Wielgus knowingly cooperated with the authorities of the Communist era. Archbishop Wielgus acknowledged that he signed a cooperation statement in 1978, but insisted that he did so only under coercion and disputed the length and characterization of his contact as described in the published reports.Archbishop admits meeting with secret police, says ‚ÄòI never inflicted any harm.‚Äô Catholic News Service, 2007-01-06 He made a public statement on January 4, 2007 indicating that he only provided information concerning his own academic work, and that the reports seriously distorted the truth. However, according to the Polish national newspaper, Rzeczpospolita Wielgus had a more extensive role than he admitted, and alleged that he provided information about student activities as far back as 1967, when he was a philosophy student at the Catholic University of Lublin. Archbishop Wielgus only acknowledged a relationship beginning in 1978. Wielgus asked the Polish Bishops' Conference to examine the files pertaining to him. The day after the discovery of the incriminating documents on 20 December 2006, the Catholic News Service announced that the Vatican Press Office had issued a statement of support regarding Wielgus: \\"The Holy See, in deciding the nomination of the new archbishop of Warsaw, took into consideration all the circumstances of his life, including those regarding his past .... (Pope Benedict XVI) has every confidence in Monsignor Stanis≈Çaw Wielgus and in full conscience entrusted him the mission of pastor of the Archdiocese of Warsaw.\\"New Catholic prelate wasn't a spy, Vatican and Polish bishops say Catholic News Service, 2006-12-21 Romania After the Romanian Revolution, the Romanian Orthodox Church never admitted of willingly collaborating with the r√©gime, but several Romanian Orthodox priests have admitted publicly after 1989 that they have collaborated with and/or were informers for the Securitate, the Romanian Communist secret police. A prime example was Bishop Nicolae Corneanu, the Metropolitan of Banat, who admitted his efforts on the behalf of the Communist Party, and denounced clergy activity with the Communists, including his own, as \\"the Church's prostitution with the Communist r√©gime\\". Before July 2006, when the matter made headlines again, Consiliul Na≈£ional pentru Studierea Arhivelor SecuritƒÉ≈£ii (The National Council for the Study of the Archives of the Securitate; CNSAS) has not made public any of the files of priests that collaborated with the Communist secret police, and has not responded to any requests by the civil society to reveal the truth in this matter. Historian StejƒÉrel Olaru claimed in a TV interview in July 2006 that he has uncovered some documents that imply that the (now late) Patriarch of Romania Teoctist was an agent of the Securitate. Right away, Constantin Stoica, the spokesperson of the Romanian Patriarchy denied that Teoctist has had any doings with Securitate, and said that the Patriarchy would not ask CNSAS to verify informations regarding the alleged connections between the high-ranking people in the Church and the former secret police, because \\"it would mean to give too much importance to this information\\".Preo≈£i colaboratori ai fostei securitƒÉ≈£i, BBC Romanian, July 28, 2006 In November 2006, however, Stoica has announced that the Sinod of the Romanian Orthodox Church has decided to form a commission, whose members would be young historians and not clergy, which would work in parallel with CNSAS, so that \\"once CNSAS identifies cases of representatives of the Church that have collaborated with the Securitate, [the Sinod] would take measures in full awareness of the facts. Every particular case would be subject to a court of the Church, in respect with the Canons of the Church.\\"\\"Masuri canonice\\" pentru preotii colaboratori ai Securitatii , Kappa.ro, November 16, 2006 Leonida Pop, who was stripped of his priesthood in the 1970s under Securitate's pressure due to his views considered reactionary by the Communists, and who subsequently fled to West Germany where he worked for a while for Radio Free Europe, told BBC that many of the leaders of the Church in 2006 would not be strangers to collaboration with the Securitate. He said that during the Communist regime it was not possible to advance in the Church hierarchy without the consent of and collaboration with the Securitate. \\"I know a few Bishops, both former and present, which were devoted servants of the Securitate\\", Pop said. In August 2008, CNSAS has announced that it had verified 260 representatives of religious organisations, including 89 clergy of the Romanian Orthodox Church, for possible collaboration with the Securitate, and has found that 6 priests indeed have worked for the Communist secret police. CNSAS warned that \\"the number of priests that have collaborated with the Securitate is considerable, given the fact that verification in some cases is still under way\\".

Allen Lane. ., pages 634-661 All key positions in the Church including bishops have been approved by the Ideological Department of Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) and by the KGB. The priests were used as agents of influence in the World Council of Churches and front organizations, such as World Peace Council, Christian Peace Conference, and the Rodina (\\"Motherland\\") Society founded by the KGB in 1975. The future Russian Patriarch Alexius II said that Rodina has been created to \\"maintain spiritual ties with our compatriots\\" as one of its leading organizers. According to the archive and other sources, Alexius has been working for the KGB as agent DROZDOV and received an honorary citation from the agency for a variety of services.The vice-president of Rodina was P.I. Vasilyev, a senior officer of First Chief Directorate of the KGB. (KGB in Europe, page 650.) Priests have also recruited intelligence agents abroad and spied on Russian emigrant communities. This information by Mitrokhin has been corroborated by other sources.According to Konstanin Kharchev, former chairman of Soviet Council on Religious Affairs, \\"Not a single candidate for the office of bishop or any other high-ranking office, much less a member of Holy Synod, went through without confirmation by the Central Committee of the CPSU and the KGB\\".

Ukraine These dissident ex- UGCC clergy called a (Soviet-supervised) \\"synod\\" (Lviv Sobor of 1946) in Lviv and at this synod annulled the Union of Brest of 1596 and all of its statutes. Ex-UGCC priest Havryil Kostelnyk (who later died under dubious circumstances) was forced or convinced to preside over this Lviv Sobor of 1946, probably due to blackmailing by the Soviet NKVD and other secret services. Ironically, as all the bishops of the UGCC were at this point either in prison or exile, no bishops of the UGCC were involved, making the supposed synod or sobor canonically illegitimate by the official canons of both Orthodox and Catholic Churches alike. Whilst officially all of the church property was transferred to the Russian Orthodox Church under the Moscow Patriarchate, some Ukrainian Greek Catholic clergy went underground. This catacomb church was strongly supported by the diaspora created by the mass emigration to the Western hemisphere, which had begun already in the 1870s and increased at the end of World War II.

One of the most critically acclaimed films of the year, Manito was hailed by critics as a film that heralded the reemergence of American neorealism and won a Special Jury Prize for Best Ensemble Cast at the Sundance Film Festival and Best Emerging Filmmaker at the Tribeca Film Festival.\\"Manito\\". IMDB. Plot Manito is set against the backdrop of a changing inner city that was once a neighborhood filled with thugs, drugs, poverty, and violence and dubbed the cocaine capital of the United States, tells the story of two brothers Junior Moreno (Franky G), an ex-convict struggling to get his life back and Manny Moreno (Leo Minaya), the salutatorian of his high school class. Although the dealers were disappearing from the neighborhood, their violent legacy remained casting a shadow over the 'hood and its residents. The film begins on the morning of Manny's graduation when various principal characters reluctantly roll out of bed, communicating with each other in overlapping arguments and cell phone conversations. Muscle-bound hunk Junior Moreno immediately channels his ever-hot-tempered energy toward long-suffering wife Miriam (Julissa Lopez) as well as the Mexican foreman (Panchito Gomez) who recruits day workers for Junior's not quite legal home-plastering biz. Reasons for Miriam's wary demeanor soon become obvious: Being a husband and father hasn't cramped Junior's lady-killer instincts one whit, with wealthy female business clients definitely on his to-do list. The day is focused on a big event: Younger sibling Manny is graduating from high school, a huge party is planned, and he is headed for Syracuse University on a full scholarship. He is the apple of everyone's eye, including his grandpa (Hector Gonzalez). Conspicuously absent from the preparations, however, is his and Junior's father Oscar (Manuel Cabral), who runs a bodega in the neighborhood but is ostracized from all contact. Only well into the story‚Äîafter he's been forcibly ejected from the boisterous celebration‚Äîdo we learn why: Oscar's criminal activities landed Junior in prison, after which the father abandoned him and the rest of the family. This black sheep's uninvited appearance casts a pall over the hitherto raucous party. As it breaks up, Manny insists on escorting home his date, gorgeous single-mom classmate Marisol (Jessica Morales). On the subway, two punch-drunk thugs interrupt their sweet courtship. When things get scary, Marisol uses her mace can, instigating a harrowing chase from which the young couple barely escapes. Shaken, Manny refuses an offer to sleep over. Marisol, afraid the thugs are still waiting outside, presses a handgun on him \\"for protection.\\" The next morning dawns with a new series of cell phone calls: Manny is in jail for shooting an attacker who's now in a coma; the second assailant is still at large. Junior knows from experience that little bro doesn't have what it takes to survive long in prison, especially since he's swiftly transferred to the hard-core Rikers Island. When Junior's desperate attempts to raise bail money and secure a decent lawyer, prove fruitless, he chokes down his bitterness and approaches Oscar for help. Their tense, then terrifying confrontation reaches an awful impasse that leaves the family's future darker than before.

Description Moore is an unincorporated community or populated place (Class Code U6) located in Emery County at latitude 38.967 and longitude -111.154. The elevation is 6,247 feet. Moore appears on the Emery East U.S. Geological Survey Map. The village is at the junction of County Routes County Road 801 and County Road 803 (known as the Moore Cut-off). The population was 5 at the 2000 census. History Originally named Rochester for the hometown in New York of M. B. Whitney who was involved in the development of the area. About the same time Emery was digging the Muddy Canal, financial investors from the Eastern States became aware of the lush, productive farmland on the flats east of the Muddy River headwaters. The investors saw the potential and formed The Independent Canal Company to claim water from the Muddy Creek and coax this arid land into producing grain like in the Midwest. Shares were offered to residents of Emery County, who also caught their vision. They began digging and blasting to build a new canal that would irrigate farmland and provide water. The town had a store, brick school, and post office. In 1940 the community was renamed Moore after postmaster L. C. Moore who became the land development project leader for the area in 1907,Origins of Utah Place Names p.32, 1941 when all of the Eastern investors had pulled out of the company. Only a few residents still live in Moore. Most residents have moved into neighboring towns but have kept their farmland which continues to produce great crops. Rochester Rock Art PanelThese pioneer settlements of the late 19th century were also the crossroads for other historic civilizations, such as the Fremont culture. Emery County was an important center for the Fremont Culture which dates back to about 700 to 1000. The later Bull Creek phase (1000‚Äì1200) seems to have developed during a wet cycle that allowed for more extensive agriculture and larger dwelling groups. Several rock art panels surround Moore, such as the Rochester Rock Art Panel.

He is portrayed by Austrian actor Christoph Waltz. For his performance, Waltz won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Best Actor Award at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, among others. Character Standartenf√ºhrer (SS Colonel) Hans Landa is an Austrian SS officer assigned to the Sicherheitsdienst. He is nicknamed \\"the Jew Hunter\\" for his uncanny ability to locate Jews hiding throughout Occupied France. Egotistical and ambitious, Landa takes a great deal of pride in his fearsome reputation, lauding his nickname \\"The Jew Hunter\\" and using it to compare himself to Reinhard Heydrich. When the tide of the war turns against the Nazis, he scoffs at it, alluding that his job is to find and capture people and the fact that they are Jews is of no consequence to him. Landa is intelligent, opportunistic, arrogant, ruthless, and relentless, but can also be circumspect, polite, and even charming. The awards and decorations on his uniform suggest Landa was a member of the Nazi Party during the July Putsch in Vienna in 1934. Besides speaking German, he is also fluent in at least English, French, and Italian. He is also sarcastic and seems to have knowledge, albeit flawed, of English language idioms, such as \\"That's a Bingo!\\" or \\"If the shoe fits, you must wear it\\". Landa is an opportunist acting only out of pure self-interest. At the beginning of the film, he subscribes to Nazi ideology as a means to power and wealth, having been a member of the Austrian Nazi party at least since 1934, as shown by his Blood Order medal and Honor Chevron. It is possible he has the Coburg Badge but it is difficult to tell due to how many medals he has. By the end of the film, he unreservedly breaks his oath to Adolf Hitler, and switches sides to assist the Basterds in assassinating Hitler and the Nazi Party elite inside a movie theater. In return for his role in the plot, Landa first demands full immunity for his war crimes, a house on Nantucket Island, a colonel's military pension, public recognition as an agent working with the American Office of Strategic Services and to be awarded the Medal of Honor (also for Aldo and Utivich). Landa receives all of his demands and surrenders himself to Allied captivity as a prisoner of war, but his driver is shot dead upon delivering Landa. Landa is then directly punished for his actions by Lt. Aldo Raine, who carves a swastika into his forehead with a Bowie knife. Conception and creation Quentin Tarantino has said that Landa might be the greatest character he has ever written. He originally wanted Leonardo DiCaprio for the part. The director then decided to have the character played by a German actor. The role ultimately went to the Austrian Waltz, who, according to Tarantino, \\"gave me my movie back\\", as he felt the movie could not be made without Landa as a character but feared the part was \\"unplayable\\".Tarantino reflects on 'Basterds', Variety.com, May 17, 2009. When Waltz auditioned for the role, he had no prior correspondence with Tarantino or producer Lawrence Bender, and believed that the character of Hans Landa was being used during the audition process to cast other roles. Waltz stated that he was most impressed with the dialogue and the depth of the character. Waltz has described Landa's character as one who has an understanding of how the world works, stating that the swastika means nothing to him. He adds that he is not driven by ideology, and that if anyone were to call Landa a Nazi, he would clarify that he was not, stating that just because he wears a Nazi uniform does not mean that he believes in the Nazi ideology. In describing the ending between the Basterds and Landa, he describes him as \\"realistic to the point of being inhuman\\", adding that he understands that the world is not just one thing at a time, and even though these things may contradict each other, they do not necessarily have to. Reception Waltz won the Best Actor Award at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival for his performance. Due to his role as Hans Landa, Waltz has received many offers from directors to play roles in their films, enough for him to describe the situation as \\"wild\\". Landa's behavior over the course of the film invokes several of the banality of evil tropes described in Hannah Arendt's Eichmann in Jerusalem, particularly with respect to his smooth, businesslike manner when interrogating Perrier LaPadite, and Landa's later statement to Raines and Utvich that he was only a detective doing his job. Film editor Hunter Stephenson commented that international viewers, Americans more so, would be surprised by Waltz's talent in this role, adding that he tipped Waltz to be nominated an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Waltz was awarded several accolades for his performance, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Screen Actors Guild Award in the same category in January 2010. He also won the BAFTA2010 Film Awards The BAFTA site. 2010-02-21. and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, becoming the first actor to win an Oscar for a performance in a Quentin Tarantino film. Analysis Hunter Stephenson of Slashfilm describes Landa's calabash as an unsubtle metaphor of masculinity, and describes his love of milk as being left over from an age of innocence and a primal link. Landa has been compared to several other characters in fiction. Waltz himself has compared the character to Sherlock Holmes, due to the meticulous, cerebral way Landa searches for Jews and traitors. Landa was also compared to Die Hard villain Hans Gruber, played by Alan Rickman, due to his disdain for the inferior intellect of those around him.

These cases typically arise when the court before which litigation is actually pending is required to decide a matter that turns on the law of another state or jurisdiction. If that other jurisdiction's law is unclear or uncertain, a certified question can then be sent to that jurisdiction's courts to render an opinion on the question of law that arose in the court in which the actual litigation is pending. The courts to whom these questions of law are certified are typically appellate courts or state supreme courts.Black's Law Dictionary, 6th ed., \\"Certification of question of state law\\" In 1985, the New York Court of Appeals, the highest court in New York, was authorized by constitutional amendment to accept certified questions. History Historically, the procedure under which one court certifies a question to another, arises out of the distinction in the law of England between common law courts and equity courts. At one time, these two were separate and parallel legal systems, differing in procedure and the sort of case each had primary jurisdiction over. From time to time, a legal issue would arise in one court that fell within the other's jurisdiction and expertise; in this situation, the two courts could certify legal questions to each other. This remains possible in the state of Delaware, which continues to have a separate Court of Chancery.Severns v. Wilmington Medical Center, Inc., Del.Supr., 421 A.2d 1334 (1980). See also, Delaware Court of Chancery Rule 72(b) . Charles Dickens made reference to the process of the two separate courts certifying questions to each other as a part of the interminable litigation in Jarndyce v. Jarndyce which figures in the plot of Bleak House: :Equity sends questions to law, law sends questions back to equity; law finds it can‚Äôt do this, equity finds it can‚Äôt do that; neither can so much as say it can‚Äôt do anything, without this solicitor instructing and this counsel appearing for A, and that solicitor instructing and that counsel appearing for B; and so on through the whole alphabet, like the history of the apple pie.Charles Dickens, Bleak House, ch. 8, \\"Covering a Multitude of Sins\\" In Clay v. Sun Insurance Office, Ltd.,377 U.S. 179 (1960) the United States Supreme Court confronted a situation where a circuit court of appeals could not \\"make a competent guess\\" about how the Florida courts would construe an insurance statute. The court observed that the Florida legislature had passed a statute allowing the federal courts to certify questions of state law to the Florida Supreme Court, but that the Florida courts had not yet made a rule establishing procedures under the statute.Clay v. Sun Insurance Office, Ltd., 377 U.S. 179, (1960) After the Clay decision, the various states began to adopt statutes or rules allowing for the certification of questions of state law to state courts. The relatively streamlined process of sending a certified question to a state appellate court also relieves federal courts of the unwieldy procedure of Pullman abstention, under which Federal courts abstain from deciding on the constitutionality of state laws while litigation seeking the construction of those laws is pending in state courts.Wendy L. Watson, McKinzie Craig, and Daniel Orion Davis, Federal Court Certification of State Law Questions In 1967, a Uniform Act was first proposed to establish a standard procedure for certified questions. In Lehman Bros. v. Schein, the Supreme Court praised the certified question procedure as helping to build a cooperative judicial federalism.Lehman Bros. v. Schein, 416 U.S. 386 (1974) As of 2014, forty-nine states, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico have established procedures under which questions of state and local law may be certified to their courts.Michael Klotz, \\"Avoiding Inconsistent Interpretations: United States v. Kelly, the Fourth Circuit, and the Need for A Certification Procedure in North Carolina,\\" 49 Wake Forest L Rev 1173 [2014] Only the state supreme court of North Carolina lacks a certification process.Ibid. Certification of questions to state courts Between state and federal courts The typical case involving a certified question involves a Federal court, which because of diversity, supplemental, or removal jurisdiction is presented with a question of state law. In these situations, the Erie doctrineErie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938) requires the Federal court that acquires jurisdiction over cases governed in part by state law to apply the substantive law of the states.Thomas R. Newman and Steven J. Ahmuty, Jr., \\"Court of Appeals Review of Certified Questions from Other Courts\\". New York Law Journal, v 231, no. 23 (Feb. 4, 2004) Generally, the Erie doctrine requires the Federal court to predict how the courts of a given state would rule and decide a given issue. Many states, however, allow certified questions to be addressed from the Federal court to the appellate court or state supreme court of that state, allowing the state court to decide those questions of law. The state courts issuing these rulings do not consider the issuance of these rulings to be advisory opinions; they relate to genuine disputes, even though those disputes are actually pending in another court. Some state supreme courts have held that the state supreme court possesses an inherent judicial power to decide state law controversies submitted by other jurisdictions, even in the absence of a statute or rule authorizing these answers.Watson et al., above; citing In re Elliott (Washington Sup. Ct., 1968) Other state courts have interpreted their states' constitutions in a manner similar to the Federal interpretation of the cases and controversies clause of the United States Constitution. The Federal courts hold that this clause restricts a court's authority to rule on moot or unripe controversies over which that court may not have jurisdiction; states that follow this rule will generally not answer certified questions of state law. In some of those states, the power to issue rulings on certified questions has been granted to the courts by constitutional amendment.See, e.g., Constitution of the State of New York, Article VII, ss. 3(b)(9), ratified 1985. Many states, by legislation or by judicial rule making, have adopted a Uniform Act called the Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act.See, e.g., North Dakota Rules of Appellate Procedure, rule 47 The uniform act provides that a state supreme court may answer questions of law certified to it by the United States Supreme Court, a court of appeals of the United States, a United States district court, or the highest appellate or intermediate appellate court of any other state. The certifying court must certify the question in writing, and the state court will accept jurisdiction and decide the issue if: #\\"questions of law of this state are involved in any proceeding before the certifying court which may be determinative of the proceeding\\"; or #\\"it appears to the certifying court there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the supreme court of this state.\\" In state courts In some states, the name \\"certified question\\" is given to what is also known as an interlocutory appeal, a procedure under which an appellate court, at its discretion, may review a decision made by a trial court that has been made before a final judgment has been entered, and that ordinarily could not be appealed directly.See, e.g., Illinois Rule of Appellate Procedure 308 Certification of questions to the United States Supreme Court Rule 19 of the Supreme Court Rules allows for the certification of legal questions to the United States Supreme Court. The rule provides that \\"a United States court of appeals may certify to this Court a question or proposition of law on which it seeks instruction for the proper decision of a case. The certificate shall contain a statement of the nature of the case and the facts on which the question or proposition of law arises. Only questions or propositions of law may be certified, and they shall be stated separately and with precision.\\"Supreme Court Rules, part IV, rule 1928 U.S.C. 1254 Certification of a question of law to the United States Supreme Court is another way, in addition to the writ of certiorari, direct appeal, and original jurisdiction, by which cases can be brought to the docket of the Supreme Court.

It lies in Goslar district north of Clausthal-Zellerfeld and west of Schulenberg. From 1959 there was a French listening post on the summit, which was supplemented in 1968 by a 64 m high concrete tower. This tower stood empty from 1993 and was demolished on 11 October 2002; the entire facility being removed in September 2003. Other listening posts in the Harz were located on the Wurmberg and the St√∂berhai. Towers that still exist include those on the Ravensberg and the Bocksberg, the latter not far from the Schalke. The observation tower, which was about 10.5 m high, stood about 50 metres southeast of the listening post until 2002 and, following the demolition of the latter, was moved back to its original site on the summit. However it only has good views towards the east and south. The view extends from the Brocken past the Wurmberg and Hansk√ºhnenburg to Clausthal-Zellerfeld. Next to the tower stands a shooting hut belonging to the Harz Club and stamp checkpoint no. 125 which is part of the Harzer Wandernadel hiking trail network. The tower is the oldest (built 1892, restored 1992) of four steel observation towers belonging to the Harzklub in the Harz. A road, closed to private cars, runs from the Auerhahn Inn on the B 241 federal highway up to the Schalke.

The courthouse was added to the National Register on 1979-08-24 as part of the Lisbon Historic District. History Columbiana County was established in 1803 and was carved out of Jefferson County. Settlers had begun arriving since 1792 and had swelled to the proper numbers to form a county by the 1800s. The Ohio General Assembly selected New Lisbon, now known as Lisbon, as the county seat with the first courts being held in the home of a local citizen, Christian Smith. The county soon built a simple log structure which cost $150 to build and furnish. This building would serve until 1817 when a new courthouse was needed. The county selected a plan for a two-story brick building with a square footprint. The interior was illuminated by rows of long rectangular windows on either side. The hipped roof topped off the building and contained a central cupola which rose into a long steeple. This courthouse served the county until 1870, when the county passed a decision for the design a new courthouse. This design was awarded to H.E. Myer and was in the Italianate style. The building came with a price tag of $106,000 which was raised through taxation and bonds. In 1934, with the aid of WPA funds, the courthouse was renovated with some major changes to the overall look of the building. A series of ten bonds(1) dated June 15, 1934 for the sum of $2,000 each were sold, a series of thirty bonds(2) dated April 1, 1935 for the sum of $1,000 each and a series of forty bonds(3) dated April 1, 1935 for the sum of $1,000 each were sold for the purpose of providing funds for permanently fireproofing, enlarging and improving the courthouse. A series of twenty bonds(4) dated September 1, 1947 for the sum of $1,000 each were sold for the purpose of reconstructing the roof and repairing and reconstructing the interior of the courthouse. (1) Numbered 1 - 10 at 5% interest (2) Numbered 1 - 30 at 3% interest (3) Numbered 1 - 40 at 3% interest (4) Numbered 1 - 20 at 1 1/4% interest Exterior The two-story smooth stone building stands facing S. Market Street with Lincoln Way, or U.S. Route 30, to its side. The building's main entrance is located in a central projection and is reached by a flight of stairs. To either side of the projection are two long arched windows on the main floor with two smaller arched windows located in the basement floors. The second floor windows are massive and contain a long rectangular window topped with a fanlight. On either side of the door in the central projection is a Doric column supporting the balcony above. Decorative brackets line the underside of the balcony and globe lights adorn the top. Above this balcony is a large recessed arch containing long rectangular windows which are crowned by a circular window. A tower tops the projection and is capped by a dome which is surmounted by a statue of Justice. The roof was once in the mansard style and contained several courtrooms. The renovation of the WPA removed the roofline and changed it to the present flat roof.

She was a member of both The Vernons Girls and The Breakaways and was the first wife of fellow singer and musician Joe Brown and mother of the singer Sam Brown. Biography Brown was born Victoria Mary Haseman, on 23 August 1940 in Liverpool, England. She married Joe Brown and, after leaving the Breakaways, remained a prolific session singer under the name Vicki Brown. The Browns had two children, Sam and Pete Brown; the former a successful singer-songwriter, the latter a record producer. In 1972, Joe Brown formed Brown's Home Brew, which played rock and roll, country and gospel music and featured his wife in the line-up. They released two albums, Brown's Home Brew (1972) and Together (1974), on which both Browns appeared. She also recorded with her sister, Mary Partington, as The Seashells reaching No. 32 in the UK Singles Chart in September 1972 with \\"Maybe I Know\\" (originally recorded in 1964 by Lesley Gore). In 1973, Brown recorded a single with Stephanie de Sykes under the name of The Tree People, entitled \\"It Happened on a Sunday Morning\\". By 1975, Brown had appeared in the film, Tommy, billed as 'Nurse #2'. Her public profile heightened after notably providing the female vocal on the 1976 UK no. 1 hit single, \\"No Charge\\", by J. J. Barrie. Brown released her first solo UK album in 1977, From The Inside, produced by Shel Talmy. The record was released by the Power Exchange Records label. In 1979 Brown began recording with The New London Chorale and the group's popularity with the Dutch people paved the way for Brown's solo stardom in the Netherlands. She also featured as one of the soloists on a series of The Young ... created by Tom Parker, with The New London Chorale: The Young Messiah (1979; originally performed as a concert on television in the UK in 1977), The Young Matthew Passion (1986) The Young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1986), The Young Verdi (1988) and The Young Beethoven (1990). Brown also worked with Gary Moore, George Harrison, Jon Lord, Roger Waters, Willy DeVille, Adam Ant, Steve Marriott, Alvin Lee, Chris Farlowe, Cerrone, Yvonne Keeley and Eric Burdon.

The JCQ closely monitors examination administration, invigilation of exams at individual schools and activities of exams officers.http://www.examofficers.org.uk/awarding-bodies-partnerships/282-jcq- partnership About The JCQ was established in January 2004 to supersede the Joint Council for General Qualifications (JCGQ, 1998‚Äì2003). The JCQ was established to unite to an extent the largest educational and vocational examination boards in the United Kingdom and to administer testing standards. The JCQ should not be confused with Ofqual (Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation), the authority to regulate and accredit British examination boards.

She was sold into commercial service in 1820 and nothing is known of her subsequent fate. Lynx Owner-investors James Williams, Amos Williams and Levi Hollingsworth commissioned the noted shipbuilder Thomas Kemp to build them a schooner. Lynx was built at Fells Point, Baltimore during the opening days of the War of 1812. She was commissioned on 14 July under captain Elisha Taylor. Lynx was a bit larger than the typical swift pilot boats after which Kemp modeled her. Kemp had increased her size to long by wide and 225 tons burthen (bm). She was fitted out as a trader though she carried a crew of 40 men and was armed with six 12-pounder long guns. She cost a little under $10,000. Lynx was a letter of marque costing the owners $34,000 to secure the L of M. That is, she was an armed merchantman with the warrant to take as prizes enemy merchantmen during the normal course of business, should the opportunity arise. As a merchantman, her crew received a regular wage; they did not depend on prizes for their income. Lynx served as a merchantman for less than a year. She made one voyage, to Bordeaux, France, and returned with a cargo of luxury goods. She was waiting with three other schooners to run the British blockade for a second voyage when the British captured her. Battle of Rappahannock River On 13 April 1813, Sir John Borlase Warren's squadron, consisting of San Domingo, Marlborough, Maidstone, Statira, Fantome, Mohawk and Highflyer blockaded four schooners in the Rappahannock River. The British sent a cutting out expedition in boats 15 miles upriver to capture the schooners at anchor. The attacking British boats carried 105 men led by Lt. James Polkinghorne while the crews of the schooners numbered 160 in all. Lynx and Arab quickly surrendered at the beginning of the attack. Racer put up more resistance. The last schooner to be taken was Dolphin, which had been on a privateering cruise and consequently carried 100 men and 12 guns. Under her captain, W.S. Stafford, she fought for about two hours before she struck. Stafford placed his losses at six killed and ten wounded. American newspapers reported that the British lost 19 killed and forty wounded. However, Polkinghorne's official report at the time gave his losses as two killed and 11 wounded. The British took three of the schooners into service. Lynx became Mosquidobit. Racer, of six guns, became ; retained her name. Lastly, it is not clear what became of Arab, of seven guns, which too had put up some resistance. It was difficult for the British to free Arab and though they eventually succeeded, the vessel was apparently badly damaged and was not commissioned for British service. She was taken to Halifax where the Vice-Admiralty Court condemned her.U.S. vessels adjudged at Halifax In July 1814, prize money remitted from Halifax for Racer, Lynx, Arab and a number of other vessels, was paid. British service The Admiralty bought Lynx for ¬£1,933 11s 5d (amended figure) and the British named her for the town of Musquodoboit Harbour, Nova Scotia, commissioning her under Lieutenant John Murray. Mosquidobit joined the British fleet blockading the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay at Lynnhaven Bay (just inside the Virginia Capes). She was subsequently stationed in Nova Scotia. On 30 March 1814 she arrived in Portsmouth. From September 1815 she was under the command of Joseph Giffiths until 1817. Eventually Mosquidobit sailed to Deptford, England where her lines were taken off (surveyed and recorded) on 10 May 1816. She then sailed out of Cork on the Irish station where she served on anti-smuggling duties. On 15 January 1817 Mosquidobit discovered Eleanor abandoned in the Irish Sea. Mosquidobit towed Eleanor in to Dublin. On 9 December 1818 Mosquidobit sent into Dublin the Dutch cutter Thetis, of Flushing. Mosquidobit had encountered Thetis off the Irish Coast and captured her after a long pursuit. Almost a year later, on 8 December 1819, Mosquidobit received a reward from the Custom-House, Dublin, for the second largest number of smugglers taken on the coast of Ireland, in the year ending 1 Oct 1819. Griffiths paid her off in December; he was promoted to the rank of Commander in August 1819. She was paid-off again in July 1819 but then reportedly served in the Mediterranean, sailing between Toulon and Marseilles. Fate By 1820, she had been decommissioned and on 13 January 1820, a Mr. Rundle purchased her for ¬£410 and placed her in private service. Nothing more is known of her. Commemoration A full scale sailing replica of this schooner, the tall ship Lynx, was built at Rockport, Maine in 2001 by Woods Maritime under President Woodson K Woods, and then operated in California. Her home is now Nanntucket, Ma transferring from port of registry previously Portsmouth, N.H. Lynx now sails the eastcoast from Maine to St Petersburg, Fl frequenting ports of Boothbay Harbor, Maine - Nantucket, Ma - Martha's Vineyard - Annapolis, MD - St Simons Island, Ga - and Tall Ship Event ports of call.

His ideology would develop mostly during his childhood, with a lot of influence from Boris Benes who not only to Benes was a model as a hard worker but as a man of humility and honesty.  College Life and the Cuban Revolution  Bernardo Benes would, as a college student, at first joined the University of Maryland, but left because he found the facilities unsatisfactory. He would later join the law school in the University of Havana. From there, through friends like Jos√© Antonio Echeverr√≠a \\"Manzanita\\", he would be exposed to student demonstrations against the Batista regime in the 1950s. With influences like Osmel Francis da los Reyes and Ren√© Anillo, Bernardo Benes would participate in activities of the revolution, joining activities of the Revolutionary Student Directorate. Dr. Benes graduated as an attorney and CPA from the University of Havana, and later became a member of the law firm ‚ÄúBufete Zaydin‚Äù. Bernardo Benes would also later become the Consultant Lawyer of the Ministry of Finance after Fidel Castro's revolution succeeded. But the executions of the Batista officials and the imprisonment of Castro's past supporters or those against the revolution would lead Benes to flee Castro's regime. His father's company was expropriated by the Castro government. Instead of a democracy, there was now a communist dictatorship. Bernardo Benes and his family fled to Miami in 1960, to start a new life in a place that would become the epicenter of Latin America.  Miami Life  In Miami, Bernardo Benes would start with a check of $210, becoming a janitor for a bank. But he would quickly rise until he owned his own bank in 1974, while also becoming a major figure in the Cuban exile community. This was partly due to all the charitable activities he participated in, mostly for helping Cuban Americans with housing and finance or giving advice on finance and politics. He would become a very prominent figure in the Miami Community, with 29 organizations listed on his r√©sum√©. One of his first roles in the community was starting a snack booth at the airport when Pedro Pan flights started, greeting newly arrived Cuban exiles. Along with that, he co-founded the Cuban Hebrew Congregation on Miami Beach in 1961, the United Way International in his community(Vice-President for the Miami- Dade County from 1965-1977). From 1962‚Äì1974, he was Vice-President of the Washington Federal Savings and Loan Association, housing consultant to USAID, IDB (Interamerican Development Bank), and the United Nations. He was leaning towards exile militanancyt at the start of his Miami career, having funded anti-Castro missions like the one in which Tony Cuesta was captured. But he became a more compromise based idealist when his radio plan of broadcasting to Cuba was rejected by the U.S. government. He looked at this event as telling him that he could accomplish nothing if he kept this type of more aggressive path, which relied too much on support from the government, when the Cuban exiles should take it into their own hands. Bernardo Benes during this time would be influenced by a friend who wanted to, through Benes, publish an article about the inhumane treatment of political prisoners in Cuba. This would be Bernardo Benes‚Äô turning point, and human rights (freeing the political prisoners and reuniting exiled families) would become his goal. Because of his religion, Bernardo Benes would also comment that this was his duty as a Jewish man to work for human rights. During this time, it was also Jimmy Carter's presidential election, and Benes would avidly support Carter, giving him a closer connection to the U.S. government. All of these aspects would help Bernardo Benes in starting and continuing his negotiations with Fidel Castro.  Negotiations from 1977-1978  Bernardo Benes‚Äô negotiations began on August 22, 1977. Benes was on vacation with his family in Panama after being invited by the future Vice President Ricardo de la Espriella, his old friend. He was eating breakfast when one of his old friends, Alberto Pons, told him some Cubans wanted to meet Bernardo Benes. They turned out to be top officials of Castro's inner circle, who wanted to use Benes as a bridge to reach diplomatic relations. Two of them were Jos√© Luis Padr√≥n and Antonio de la Guardia. After this meeting, Bernardo Benes would contact Larry Sternfield, a CIA agent who he was well acquainted with, who told him who the men were, while telling Benes to continue to meet with them. Bernardo Benes would bring with him Charles Dascal, one of the first people he told about the Panama meeting. After a meeting between the Cuban officials and Benes on February, 1978, Bernardo Benes would hand a memorandum to Zbigniew Brzezinski, the National Security Advisor for Carter. Brzezinski and Benes would have a rocky start, and Brzezinski would find Benes unfit for the role, sending two of his own men to continue conversations. But Benes would talk to Cyrus Vance (Secretary of State) and Peter Tarnoff, with the FBI instead of the CIA now instructing Benes. The negotiations between the Cuban officials and Bernardo Benes happened in Panama, Nassau, Mexico, Jamaica, Washington D.C., and New York, totaling up to around 75 meetings. In these conversations, Bernardo Benes and Charles Dascal negotiated for the freedom of the political prisoners, family reunification, and more peaceful relations between the United States and Cuba. Bernardo Benes also had around 14 personal meetings with Fidel Castro, more than 150 hours total, continuing with discussions about human rights. In these meetings, many differences in American and Cuban Culture during the Cold War can be seen. For example, during one of the meetings, Bernardo Benes noticed Castro had Florsheim boots worth more than a hundred dollars. When asking Castro why he wore these low-quality boots, Castro was surprised and replied he thought they were one of the best. Bernardo Benes would later buy Johnston and Murphy boots for $350, which Castro gladly accepted. Many more moments like this would occur, where the development of the United States and the Miami community abroad would surprise Castro. On October 20, 1978, Benes and five other Cuban exiles would arrive in Cuba to bring 46 prisoners back to Miami. In the time that they spent there, the press got to interview the prisoners at the Combinado del Este prison, meeting with Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, one of the more famous prisoners. They would during this time have a meeting with Fidel Castro. One of the released would be Tony Cuesta. Bernardo Benes after the one in October had two more ‚Äúdialogues‚Äù, bringing more exiles to meet Castro, and bringing even more prisoners back in November and December. Castro promised to release 3,600 prisoners and issue permits so families could visit the family members they were separated from. Carter would also remove human rights as one of the reasons stopping the U.S. from restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba.  Afterwards  But there were multiple complications that came with Bernardo Benes' negotiations. For one, prisoners were being released at a slower rate than agreed on because the U.S. failed to give enough permits, which was caused by the Attorney General not willing to grant visas unless all prisoners were interviewed. During the Reagan years, this process will halt until another deal between Reagan and Castro was reached. Along with that in the Reagan years, visits to Cuba would also be minimalized, though later restored. Another thing that damaged the result of the negotiations is the Mariel Boatlift. The Mariel Boatlift brought 120,000 refugees including released criminals and mental patients. This would damage Carter's image and be one of the reasons he lost the election. The crime in Miami where most of the refugees came to would increase, while the people couldn't be absorbed into the labor market. This would greatly damage the image of the Cubans exiles. But as the years passed, the refugees were accepted and integrated. But Bernardo Benes was ostracized rather than put in the spotlight as a hero. Militant exile groups like Alpha 66 viewed Benes as a traitor to them, having talked to Castro. Two of the people who participated in the dialogue were assassinated, while Benes had to wear a bulletproof vest the first year after his negotiations. Benes would constantly be under fire by the media, with radios and newspaper writing against him. Many old friends of his would avoid him or treat him rudely. Often, when he walked into a restaurant, one of the customers would try to spit at or insult him. He survived possibly two assassination attempts, and a bomb exploding at the bank he worked at.  Death  Bernardo Benes died on January 14, 2019, after suffering for around three years from a disease. He had a private funeral, remaining mostly unknown to the public. He was still never accepted into the community and had trouble finding work for the rest of his life. But his work lives on as now Obama has restored diplomatic relations, though the embargo on Cuba still remains. Fidel Castro and most of his supporters have too also died.

It includes elements of both real property law (specifically conveyances) and contract law. History The landlord-tenant relationship is defined by existence of a leasehold estate.Casner, A.J. et al. Cases and Text on Property, Fifth Edition. Apsen Publishers, New York, NY: 2004, p. 403 Traditionally, the only obligation of the landlord in the United States was to grant the estate to the tenant,Teitelbaum v. Direct Realty Co., 13 N.Y.S.2d 886 (NY 1939) although in England and Wales, it has been clear since 1829 that a Landlord must put a tenant into possession.Coe v. Clay (1829) 5 Bing. 440; Woodfall Landlord & Tenant Sweet & Maxwell, 11.269 Modern landlord-tenant law includes a number of other rights and duties held by both landlords and tenants. The modern interpretation of the tenant-landlord relationship has hinged on the view that leases include many elements of contract law in addition to a simple conveyancing. In American landlord-tenant law, many of these rights and duties have been codified in the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act.Glendon, M.A. The Transformation of American Landlord-Tenant Law, 23 B.C. L. Rev. 503-05 (1982) Residential and commercial leases Landlord‚Äìtenant law generally recognizes differences between residential and commercial leases on the assumption that residential leases present much more of a risk of unequal bargaining power than commercial leases.Rabin, E.H. The Revolution in Residential Landlord-Tenant Law: Causes and Consequences, 69 Cornell L. Rev. 517 (1984) Residential leases are contracts that are designed for individuals or groups to live, or reside, in the leased space. Most governmental entities have \\"recognized the sanctity of the home.\\" Therefore, lessees of residential spaces are generally afforded more rights and protections than commercial leases. It is also because of the presumption of unequal bargaining power that residential spaces are afforded more protections. States, counties, and cities have different laws, and likewise, varying levels of protections for the tenants and landlords of commercial spaces. Commercial leases are leases for spaces that are for business uses, such as industrial, office, retail, and manufacturing. Commercial leases generally have fewer consumer protections than residential leases because they are subject to much more negotiation. Landlord duties The modern concept of landlord-tenant law includes duties beyond simple conveyancing of the lease: Duty to deliver possession In England and according to the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act in India, the landlord has a duty to deliver possession to the tenant at the beginning of a lease. The justification for placing this burden on the landlord is the idea that the landlord has more resources than the new tenants to pursue legal remedies against wrongful holdovers (former tenants that will not give up possession of the lease).Schoshinski, R. American Law of Landlord and Tenant ¬ß3.1 (1980) Covenant of quiet enjoyment By virtue of the contractual aspects of a lease, modern leases in America include an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. This means that the landlord will not interfere with the tenant's possessory rights to the lease.Glendon, p. 511-14 Though a landlord may forcibly enter without required notice during an emergency, generally a mere necessity for quick action does not constitute an emergency within the doctrine of imminent peril, where the situation calling for the action is one which should reasonably have been anticipated and which the person whose action is called for should have been prepared to meet;Kuist v. Curran, 116 Cal. App. 2d 404 the doctrine of imminent peril does not excuse one who has brought about the peril by her own negligence.Warren v. Sullivan, 188 Cal. App. 2d 150 Implied warranty of habitability A landlord must provide shelter free of serious defects which might harm health or safety. In some states, the tenant has the right to cancel the lease and move out if the defects are severe enough and the landlord has not made repairs in a reasonable amount of time. Tenants who want to cancel their leases should seek the counsel of an attorney or a governmental agency devoted to landlord tenant issues to ensure that the conditions are severe enough to cancel the lease. Duty to Provide essential Services In at least one state, the state of Oklahoma, a landlord is required by state law to provide for reasonable amounts of running water, hot water, electricity, gas, or other essential services. Failure of which, may result in, among other remedies, deduction of the price paid by the tenant for said services from the rent. Other States may have similar provisions of law.See e.g. 41 Okla. Stat. Sec. 41-121(C)(2017). http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=71770 Retrieved April 02, 2018. Tenant remedies Landlord‚Äìtenant law also includes protections for tenants: Constructive eviction In an action for unpaid rent brought by a landlord against a tenant, a tenant can offer constructive eviction as an affirmative defense. A constructive eviction means that the tenant is no longer able to occupy the lease, but that the tenant was not physically evicted by the landlord.Schloshinski, ¬ß¬ß3.3-3.8 This is often used in conjunction with a breach of the implied covenant of habitability. Breach of covenant Leases include dependent covenants - if the landlord fails to perform their duties, the tenant will be relieved of paying rent. The breach of these covenants can be used as an affirmative defense by the tenant in an action for unpaid rent or eviction. These covenants include the warrant of habitability (keeping the premises habitable) and the covenant to repair (requiring the landlord to repair damage to the premises).Casner, p. 422 In American law, the warrant of habitability was established by the D.C. Circuit case Javins v. First National Realty Corp. Retaliatory eviction also see: Retaliatory eviction A landlord cannot evict a tenant in retaliation for reporting health and safety code violations.Casner, p. 504 A tenant can use retaliatory eviction as both an affirmative defense against an eviction and as a cause of action against a landlord. The defense of retaliatory eviction was first recognized in the D.C. Circuit case Edwards v. Habib. In California, retaliatory eviction is considered an affirmative defense and can be used to defend a case. The California code 1942.5 defines the legal aspects of its use and further goes on to prohibit Retaliatory eviction, for no less than 180 days, after a series of triggering events. Some form of protection for tenants against retaliatory eviction is available in 42 State statutes and the District of Columbia laws. The only eight states without this protection are Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Wyoming. However, in the state of Oklahoma, it is a misdemeanor criminal offense to willfully disturb, interfere, or obstruct state business, such as the official business of code enforcement, and thus retaliatory eviction may violate various applicable state criminal laws.21 Okla. Stat. ¬ß21-280 (2017). https://law.justia.com/codes/oklahoma/2017/title-21/section-21-280/ RET. April 02 2018. Money damages Some states, such as Wisconsin, allow for the tenant to recover money damages if the landlord breaks the state statutes or administrative codes. The tenant has the duty to prove that the landlord owes money to the tenant for damages. If the tenant can prove that an Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection Code rule was violated, they are entitled to double the damages under Wisconsin Law. Tenant duties An eviction notice for failure to pay rent. The fact that the city of New Orleans was under a mandatory order and no mail had been delivered since two months before was not taken into consideration. Tenants also have duties attached to their possessory interests: Duty to preserve the premises Leases usually include a limited covenant to repair for the tenants, and this essentially equates to refraining from committing waste. When tenants move from the premises, if they want to get their security deposit returned to them, most statutes require the premises to be returned to the landlord in the same condition that it was in when they moved in, minus normal wear and tear. Duty to operate In commercial leases, a duty to operate may be written into the lease. This means that a commercial tenant cannot leave a rented property vacant without operating the business for which the lease was made. A duty to operate does not exist unless written into the lease or obviously in line with the intent of the lease. Duty to pay rent A tenant's duty to pay rent was traditionally thought of as an independent covenant, meaning that the tenant was required to pay rent regardless of whether the landlord fulfilled their duties of performance.Schoshinski, ¬ß10.7 Now the duty of a tenant to pay rent is considered to be a dependent covenant, and the tenant can be freed from the duty to pay rent if the landlord breaches the covenant of repair or warranty of habitability.Casner, A.J., et al. p. 483 Landlord remedies Landlords also have a variety of available remedies to reclaim possession or claim unpaid rent: Forfeiture Before statutory eviction processes, landlords could use the common law remedy of forfeiture to reclaim possession of a lease. Forfeiture was generally achieved by adding a condition subsequent to the terms of the lease.Casner, A.J., et al. pp. 490-491 Self- help Landlord self-help remedies are evictions where \\"the landlord takes active steps to remove the tenant from the property without initiating legal action.\\" Self-help remedies have been limited by forcible entry and detainer (FED) statutes.Casner, A.J. et al. pp. 492-493 Most states have prohibited self-help eviction. Monetary damages Landlords can also recover monetary damages for unpaid rent, and the methods of obtaining the rent and the amount that can be obtained are dictated by state statutes.Schoschinski, ¬ß6.1 Eviction A landlord may commence an action through the courts to evict a tenant. Eviction normally takes the form of a lawsuit, requiring an initial notice to a tenant, followed by court proceedings in which the tenant may contest the eviction and potentially file a counter-claim. At the conclusion of the eviction process, if the landlord prevails, the court will issue an order that the property be restored to the possession of the landlord, and potentially allowing for the forcibly removal of the tenant and any property left on the premises. Subsidized and public housing Affordable housing such as subsidized housing has other regulations. Many programs assign rent according to the tenant's income. Therefore, tenants have to report any changes in their income. Jurisdiction-specific Massachusetts Massachusetts allows eviction of tenants with leases for cause, including lease violations, failure to pay rent, and use of the rental property for illegal purposes. Tenants who do not have a lease term may be evicted either for cause or without cause upon proper notice. Texas For the majority of Texas history, landlord-tenant relationships were governed by principles of old English common law.Landlords and Tenants Guide, Special Report No. 866, Judon Fambrough (Revised September 2016). The common law was harsh to tenants. Texas tenants leased their property ‚Äúas is‚Äù under the common law doctrine of caveat emptor, Latin for ‚Äúlet the buyer beware.‚ÄùYarbrough v. Booher, 141 Tex. 420, 174 S.W.2d 47 (1943); Morton v. BurtonLingo Co., 136 Tex. 263, 150 S.W.2d 239 (1941). The tenant was expected to carefully inspect the property before signing her lease. Afterwards, she was expected to continue paying rent even if the property became uninhabitable. Of course, landlords and tenants could contract for the landlord to make needed repairs and maintain the condition otherwise, but there was no legal duty to do so.Clarence Clinton Davis Jr., Recognition of an Implied Covenant of Habitability in Residential Leaseholds: Kamarath v. Bennett, 32 SW L.J. 1037 (1978). The default was that the tenant's duty to pay rent was independent of the landlord's duty to maintain or repair the premises.Landlords and Tenants Guide, Special Report No. 866, Judon Fambrough (Revised September 2016). Texas started offering its tenants stronger protections in 1978. That year, the Texas Supreme Court decided Kamarath v. Bennett.Kamarath v. Bennett, 568 S.W.2d 658 (Tex. 1978) In that case, the Texas Supreme Court held that all residential leases contain an ‚Äúimplied warranty of habitability.‚Äù The ‚Äúimplied warranty‚Äù changed the game. It required all landlords to keep their property \\"habitable,\\" even if the residential lease did not specifically require them to make any repairs. And on top of that, it conditioned the tenant's duty to pay rent on the landlord's duty to keep the property habitable. That is, tenants had the legal right to stop paying rent if the landlord failed to keep the property habitable. In one fell swoop, the Texas Supreme Court struck a huge victory for Texas tenants. The court-created ‚Äúimplied warranty of habitability‚Äù lasted for about a year. In 1979, the Texas legislature swiftly responded by enacting Section 92 of the Texas Property Code.Landlords and Tenants Guide, Special Report No. 866, Judon Fambrough (Revised September 2016). That statute comprehensively governs Texas landlord-tenant relationships. Specifically, it codified the landlord's duty to keep the property habitable, and it provided further clarifications. Now, per Texas statutory law, the landlord has a duty to make a diligent effort to repair or remedy a condition if the tenant gave notice of the condition, the tenant is not delinquent in the payment of rent at the time notice is given, and the condition materially affects the physical health or safety of an ordinary tenant.Texas Property Code ¬ß 92.052. However, Texas landlords have no duty to repair conditions caused by tenants.Property Code ¬ß 92.053. A tenant whose landlord has breached her duty to keep the property habitable has a few different legal options. She can terminate the lease; she can make the repairs herself and then deduct the cost from a subsequent rent payment; or she could take her landlord to court.Property Code ¬ß 92.056.

After the final boss is defeated the player(s) must destroy his small remnants within a time limit. If the player(s) fail to do so, the game has a \\"bad ending\\", but if the remnants are destroyed within the time limit the player(s) receive the \\"good ending\\".

All characters (excluding Famardy) are playable and have all been given special attacks executed using standard fighting game motions. Players must destroy all other monsters, one after the other, without any of the scrolling stages in the Neo-Geo version and then defeat a clone of the player's monster to win the game.

Life He was born on 18 November 1769. His success in life was due to William Vincent, by whose help he was admitted to Westminster School; in 1784 he was elected a king's scholar, in 1788 he became the captain of the school, and in the following year he was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, which was at that time presided over by Cyril Jackson. He took the degree of M.A. in 1796. and became a tutor of his house, where he also filled the office of censor from 1798 to 1802. While connected with Oxford life he held the incumbency of the neighbouring church of Cowley, and near the close of his academic career, in 1801. he was nominated one of the preachers at Whitehall Chapel. The prebendal stall of Knaresborough-cum-Bickhill in York Cathedral was conferred on him in 1804, and he instituted to the vicarage of Sutton-in-the-Forest. Through the influential support of Cyril Jackson, Carey was appointed to the head-mastership of Westminster School in January 1803, staying until December 1814. He proceeded to the degree of B.D. in 1804, and to that of D.D. in 1807. The honorary post of sub-almoner to the king was given to him in 1808, and in March 1809 he received a prebend at Westminster. On resigning his position at his old school he withdrew to his country living, residing there until 1820, when he was called to preside over the diocese of Exeter. At Exeter he remained for ten years, when he was translated to St Asaph, being elected to his new see on 12 March 1830 and confirmed on 7 April. He died at his house in Portland Place, London, on 13 September 1846, but his body was carried into Wales and buried in the churchyard of St, Asaph Cathedral on 2 October 1846. A monument to his memory was erected in his cathedral. He made a large benefaction of ¬£20,000 to Christ Church, for the maintenance of Old Westminsters preparing themselves for holy orders. He also gave new scenery for the Westminster school play to replace the sets designed by Athenian Stuart. Carey's scenery was in use for fifty years, from 1808 to 1858.

Early life and education Trautwein was born in Paramus, New Jersey on March 29, 1920, attended Hackensack High School and earned a baseball scholarship at Columbia University. He was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals as a pitcher, but needed to work to help support his family and got a job as a stevedore. After attending the United States Merchant Marine Academy, he served in the United States Navy during World War II. Following the completion of his military service, he attended New York University and earned his law degree from the New York University School of Law, passing the bar in 1953.Corcoran, David. \\"Theodore Trautwein, Judge in Landmark Press Case, Dies at 80\\", The New York Times, September 2, 2000. Accessed October 13, 2009. Judicial career As a county court judge starting in 1964, and later as a district court judge, Trautwein issued rulings that supported creation of the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission to provide state oversight of development in the New Jersey Meadowlands and of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which brought horse racing and professional sports to the Meadowlands. He was named as a New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division judge in 1981. Dr. X. trial and shield laws In 1978, the \\"Dr. X\\" murder trial of Mario Jascalevich, a physician who had been charged with murdering three of his patients at an Oradell, New Jersey hospital with curare was brought to trial. The cases had occurred in the mid-1960s and the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office had declined to pursue the cases at the time. In 1976, reporter M. A. Farber of The New York Times wrote a series of articles that exposed the cases, with the public attention and outcry leading the Bergen County Prosecutor to reopen the cases, exhume and test the bodies for curare, and file charges against Dr. Jascalevich after the muscle relaxant was found by chemical analysis. Attorney Raymond A. Brown blamed other doctors at the hospital of framing Jascalevich to cover up their own ineptitude and charged that Farber had conspired with prosecutors to advance their respective careers by pointing the finger of blame at Jascalevich.Berger, Joseph. \\"Raymond A. Brown, Civil Rights Lawyer, Dies at 94\\", The New York Times, October 11, 2009. Accessed October 12, 2009. After Brown subpoenaed the reporter, Farber testified in the case but cited the First Amendment of the United States Constitution when he refused to turn over thousands of pages of the reporter's notes that the defense had requested, citing a compelling right to protect the identity of the sources used in the articles from individuals who had spoken to him with the expectation that their confidence would be maintained. Time magazine called the deadlock \\"a head-on collision between the First and Sixth Amendments\\", citing the conflict between the reporter's and newspaper's right of freedom of the press and the defendant's right to a fair trial.Staff. \\"Press: Piercing a Newsman's Shield\\", Time, August 7, 1978. Accessed October 14, 2009. Trial judge William J. Arnold had Judge Trautwein address the issues related to the release of the papers in his role as an assignment judge for all Bergen County courts. In July 1978, Trautwein sentenced Farber to six months in jail and assessed fines of $5,000 each day to The Times, saying that Farber had chosen placing \\"your privilege and your concept of your constitutional rights above the rights of the people of this state and this defendant\\" With several breaks for appeals, Farber ended up spending a total 40 days in the Bergen County Jail and was not released until October 24 after Jascalevich was acquitted. The New Jersey Supreme Court upheld Trautwein's decision and stripped reports of shield law protections, though the New Jersey Legislature responded by passing even stronger shield laws to protect reporters. Governor of New Jersey Brendan Byrne pardoned Farber in 1982 and $100,000 of the fines were reimbursed to the newspaper. Trautwein's actions in regard to Farber have been used as a case study in both law schools and schools of journalism. Jane E. Kirtley of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press cited how \\"Farber's case roused journalists out of their complacency\\", noting that \\"Going to jail for more than a month is significant in anyone's eyes.\\" Trantino parole Thomas Trantino had been sentenced to life in prison for the shooting deaths in 1963 of two police officers in Lodi, New Jersey. The New Jersey State Parole Board was willing to release him once arrangements were made for making restitution to the survivors and in 1980 assigned Trautwein responsibility for setting the amounts. Trautwein refused to do so, saying, \\"It would be a gruesome, illogical, self-evident act of futility to order the restoration of the victims' lives.\\"Hanley, Robert. \\"Judge in Jersey Declines to Put Price on 2 Lives; So Restitution Move Fails in Murder Parole Case An 'Impossible' Task Background of the Case Police Demonstration Recalled Judge Declines to Set A Price for Restitution In Murder Parole Case Application to Murder\\", The New York Times, October 3, 1980.

This silent film explores the then-newly constructed Rotterdam vertical-lift railroad bridge: its structure, mechanisms, complex actions, and the steam-powered trains and ships making use of it.  Synopsis  Three views of the film camera appear \\"as if in a technical drawing. It then proceeds to examine the bridge from all angles.\\" The bridge is shown in ultrawide format, then wide, then in close-up, from a train rider's viewpoint. The view shifts to outside the train looking down at the harbor water far below, then to clouds of steam obscuring and revealing the bridge's steel structure. A worker ascends, inspects, observes the surrounding environs, and descends the superstructure. From a vantage point between two train cars coupled together, the countryside flits by as the train makes its way to the bridge. The bridgemaster at the control console commands the raising of the central section, and the massive alignment grooves, pulleys, cables, and counterweights are all detailed in their steady synchronized operation until the bridge's maximum height of 38 meters is reached. Sailing and steam ships then make their way under the raised bridge, while the steam train waits, puffing. The bridge descends, the counterweights rise, and the train continues on its way.  History  Ivens founded and remained involved in the Amsterdam film-league (Filmliga), while he managed his father's photographic business and attended university. Ivens' \\"first enthusiasm was the abstract films sent to them -- sometimes brought to them -- from Germany by new film directors Ruttmann, Eggeling, Richter, and others,\\" and De Brug, one of Ivens' first ventures into filmmaking, followed in a similar vein.Barnouw, p. 77 In the 1920s, the modern, technology-oriented city of Rotterdam had become quite popular. The construction of its new lifting bridge (Hefbrug, or De Hef) was covered extensively in the press, and inspired artists as well.Van Ulzen, p. 55 Ivens called the bridge \\"a laboratory of movements, tones, shapes, contrasts, rhythms, and the relations between all of these.\\" He climbed the bridge over a period of months and filmed it \\"day after day\\" on lunch breaks, searching for \\"expressive angles.\\"Barnouw, p. 77 According to van Ulzen, Ivens' \\"almost entirely abstract\\" film achieved immediate world fame.

The park is located near Watkins Glen State Park and maintained by its staff, as well as by volunteers. Description The park encompasses a recreation trail that follows abandoned railroad grades and canal towpaths between Watkins Glen and Horseheads. The trail is level and finished with crushed limestone, and is wheelchair- accessible. The trail is open year-round, and allows for walking, biking, cross-country skiing, and snowshoeing. As of 2016, of the trail are open to the public, with plans for the trail to grow to in length. History Catharine Valley is named for Catherine Montour, a prominent Seneca leader who died in the late eighteenth century. Portions of the park's trail are built upon towpaths originally constructed for the Chemung Canal, which was completed in 1830 and closed in 1878. Much of the trail's remainder follows the defunct Chemung Railroad, which was built parallel to the canal in 1850. The land that became the park was donated to the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation in 1997 by Ed Hoffman, a local resident who had worked toward the creation of the park since the 1970s.

Guerrero was an independent candidate for Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands in the 2009 gubernatorial election. Guerrero previously worked as an assistant to former Governor Froilan Tenorio for seven years. Guerrero also served as the former executive director of the Commonwealth Utilities Corporation (CUC) for four years. In 1999, Guerrero was elected to the Northern Mariana Islands Senate as a member of the local Reform Party. He was sworn into office in 2000 and served as a Senator until 2004, when he left office after losing his 2003 re-election bid. Guerrero died at age 71, in Guam. Biography Campaign for Governor Guerrero announced his candidacy for Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands in January 2009. At the time, Guerrero said that he had made the final decision to run for governor in early December 2008. In a January 2009 telephone interview with the Saipan Tribune, Guerrero explained his motivation for his gubernatorial bid, \\"The problems we're facing today are right in front of us. It's telling us how to solve it. We've been playing politics all the time. Politics, everything is politics. We cannot solve this problem by playing politics. We have to go straightforward. We just cannot play this game anymore.\\" Speaking about incumbent office holders who were seeking the governorship in 2009, \\"How many candidates are running for governor who are in office. What more can they promise? People are suffering. What else can they do? The people are suffering and I want to help. I've been there and I want to help.\\" Guerrero further announced at the time that the slogan for his 2009 gubernatorial campaign slogan would be, \\"'Time for a change.\\" He held his first campaign strategy meeting with supporters at his home in As Perdido, Saipan, on January 23, 2009. Rudy Sablan became his campaign chairman. In March 2009, Guerrero announced that he had chosen David Borja, the former commissioner of the Northern Mariana Islands Public School System, to be his running mate for lieutenant governor. Guerrero said that Borja was chosen from a list of 18 possible running mates, \\"I asked my committee to streamline the Top 5. In the end, Dr. Borja emerged on top.\\" The Guerrero-Borja team became the first candidates to officially register with the Commonwealth Election Commission to run for Governor on July 10, 2009. During the campaign, Guerrero urged young people studying overseas to return to the Northern Mariana Islands after completing their education. Guerrero stated that he believed low wages were the major reason why young people choose to work on the U.S. mainland. He said the CNMI government needed to do more to encourage young people to stay in the Commonwealth and that the CNMI should pay workers \\"their worth.\\" He called on younger workers to return to the CNMI so that older workers could retire saying, \\"This is their home and we, their people, need them.\\" References External links *Ramon 'Kumoi' Guerrero (Kumoi Borja 2009) Category:1946 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Northern Mariana Islands Senators Category:People from Saipan Category:Reform Party (Northern Mariana Islands) politicians ","title":"Ramon Deleon Guerrero"},{"id":"24681037","text":"Radom Ghetto was a Nazi ghetto set up in March 1941 in the city of Radom during occupation of Poland, for the purpose of persecution and exploitation of Polish Jews. It was closed off from the outside officially in April 1941. A year and a half later, the liquidation of the ghetto began in August 1942, and ended in July 1944, with approximately 30,000‚Äì32,000 victims (men, women and children) deported aboard Holocaust trains to their deaths at the Treblinka extermination camp.The statistical data compiled on the basis of \\"Glossary of 2,077 Jewish towns in Poland\\" by Virtual Shtetl Museum of the History of the Polish Jews (Polish), as well as \\"Getta ≈ªydowskie\\" by Gedeon (Polish) and \\"Ghetto List\\" by Michael Peters at ARC. Accessed March 12, 2015. Background In the invasion of Poland, the city of Radom was overrun by the German forces on 8 September 1939. The total population was 81,000 at that time of which 25,000 were Jewish. ‚ÄúRadom‚Äù Encyclopedia of Jewish Communities in Poland, Volume VII (Poland), Translation of ‚ÄúRadom‚Äù chapter from Pinkas Hakehillot Polin, Published by Yad Vashem On 30 November 1939 the SS- Gruppenf√ºhrer Fritz Katzmann from Selbstschutz who led the murder operations earlier in Wroc≈Çaw, and in Katowice, was appointed the Higher SS and Police Leader (SSPF) of occupied Radom. His arrival was followed by wanton violence and plunder for personal gain. Katzmann ordered the execution of Jewish leaders right away. Before the creation of a ghetto, many Jews were pressed into forced labor. One of their first tasks on German orders was to rebuild the prewar Polish ≈Åucznik Arms Factory damaged in the attack, to meet the German military needs. The factory served as the major local Nazi employer throughout the war. The Germans forced the Jewish community to pay contributions, and seized their valuables and businesses. Nevertheless, the precious metal holdings were already depleted because the Radom Jews ‚Äì especially the Jewish women from \\"Wizo\\" ‚Äì made massive donations to Polish air-force fund for months before the invasion. Even the least fortunate Jews purchased air-defense bonds with pride until May 1939. Soon after the invasion, around September‚ÄìOctober 1939, the SS conducted surprise raids on synagogues. The worshipers were dragged out and put into labour commandos. The Radom Synagogue was desecrated by the Nazis and its furnishings destroyed. To instill fear, the Jewish city councilor Jojna (Yona) Zylberberg was marched with a stone over his head and beaten by the SS soldiers. His wife died in an accident at home only months earlier by falling out of a window when she tried to hang sheers, leaving her two children behind. Around December 1939 January 1940 the Judenrat was established to serve as an intermediary organization between the German command and the local Jewish community. One thousand men were sent to labour camps of the Lublin reservation in the summer of 1940. In December, the German Governor-General Hans Frank stationing in Krak√≥w ordered the expulsion of 10,000 Jews from the city. Only 1,840 were deported due to technical difficulties. In the spring of 1941 there were about 32,000 Jews in Radom. Katzmann remained there until Operation Barbarossa. Ghetto history The city of Radom received Jews expelled from other locations in Poland including the Jewish inmates of the Krak√≥w Ghetto because Krak√≥w ‚Äì according to the wishes of Gauleiter Hans Frank ‚Äì was to become the \\"racially cleanest\\" city of the General Government territory to serve as its German capital. The Governor-General Frank issued an order to create Radom ghetto in March 1941. A week earlier the Jewish Ghetto Police was formed by the new Nazi administration to aid with the relocations. The Jews were given ten days in which to vacate their prewar homes and settle within the ghetto zone along with their families. The area was split in two like in many other Polish cities. The ghetto gates were closed from the outside on 7 April 1941. About 33,000 Polish Jews were gathered there; 27,000 at the main ghetto, and about 5,000 at a smaller ghetto in the suburb. Most of the ghetto area was not walled; the barriers were formed by the buildings themselves and the exits were managed by Jewish and Polish police. The \\"large ghetto\\" was set up at Wa≈Çowa street in central ≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie District and the \\"small ghetto\\" at the Glinice District. with armbands in the Radom Ghetto, March 1941 As with many other ghettos across occupied Poland, starvation was not uncommon. The German- allotted rations for a person in the ghetto were 100 grams (3.5 oz) of bread per day. Nonetheless the conditions in the Radom Ghetto were on average better than in many other contemporary ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe. In the first months of 1942 the Germans carried out several actions, arresting or summarily executing various leaders of the Jewish community. The Germans began to liquidate the Radom Ghetto in earnest, starting in August 1942 as part of Operation Reinhard. The first large deportation emptied the smaller Glinice ghetto. The Germans were aided by the Polish Blue Police units,The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933‚Äì1945, volume 2, part A, edited by Geoffrey P. Megargee, page 291 and \\"Hiwis\\". By the end of August approximately 2,000 Jews remained in Radom. The deported Jews were sent to extermination camps (primarily Treblinka and Auschwitz). The remnants of the Radom ghetto were turned into a temporary labor camp. The last Radom Jews were evicted in June 1944, when on June 26 the last inhabitants were deported to Auschwitz. Only a few hundred Jews from Radom survived the war. 1941 Radom issued Jewish ID card from the German occupation of Poland. Escape and rescue Among the Polish rescuers of Jews, the most prominent role belonged to Dr. Jerzy Borysowicz (pl), director of the mental hospital in Radom located at Warszawska Street. The facility was spared by the Nazis only because the former church building could not be turned into any war-related purpose. The Jews, including children, were receiving daily help from Borysowicz as well as his medical staff in total secrecy. The most dramatic was the rescue of people suffering in the ghetto from the Typhoid fever. Borysowicz treated Mordechai Anielewicz, leader of the Jewish Combat Organization instrumental in engineering the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Most of his patients however, did not survive the Holocaust. Anielewicz died in the Uprising. Borysowicz was awarded the title of Righteous among the Nations posthumously, in 1984, four years after his death on 5 June 1980. Among those Poles who were murdered by the Nazis for saving Jews was 60-years-old Adam Rafa≈Çowicz living in Radom, shot on 18 September 1942 for rendering help to a Jew; There were more such murders in the Radom county. A group of villagers from around Ciepiel√≥w near Radom including Piotr Skoczylas and his 8-year-old daughter Leokadia were burned alive by a police battalion on 6 December 1942 for sheltering Jews. On the same day, another barn full of people was set on fire in nearby Rek√≥wka, and 33 Poles saving Jews were burned alive including the families of Obuchiewicz, Kowalski, and 14 Kosiors. Roman Jan Szafranski, age 64, living in Radom with his wife Jadwiga, were caught sheltering a Jewish girl, Anna Kerc (born in 1937); the girl was killed, he was sent to Gross- Rosen concentration camp where he perished. His wife was sent to Ravensbruck but survived.

History World Radio Missionary Fellowship, Inc. - Reach Beyond - began in 1931 as Radio Station HCJB in Quito, Ecuador, South America. The ministry was the vision of Clarence W. Jones, a musician, graduate of Moody Bible Institute, and the son of a Salvation Army minister. Following his graduation from Moody, Jones worked under evangelist Paul Rader and was part of the founding staff of the Chicago Gospel Tabernacle where Jones assisted in leading music, working with youth and overseeing Rader's weekly radio ministry called \\"WJBT\\" (Where Jesus Blesses Thousands)Come Up To This Mountain, Neely, Lois - Tyndale Publishers, 1980; pg. 31 Impressed by the impact Rader's radio ministry had made, Jones felt called to establish missionary radio in Latin America. As a result, Jones traveled to Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Cuba on a seven-week trip in 1928 looking for a suitable location for his envisioned radio station, but was unable to obtain the necessary government permits.Come Up To This Mountain, Neely, Lois - Tyndale Publishers, 1980; pg. 54 Back in Chicago nearly two years later, Jones met Christian & Missionary Alliance (C&MA;) missionaries from Ecuador - Reuben and Grace Larson, John and Ruth Clark and Paul and Bernice Young. These missionaries encouraged Jones to consider Ecuador as the place to start his missionary radio station. As the first step in fulfilling his vision, Jones needed to obtain a contract of approval from the Ecuadorian government for setting up the radio station. Reuben Larson and D. Stuart Clark, along with Ecuadorian lawyer Lu√≠s Calisto, worked to procure the initial contract. On August 15, 1930, the Ecuadorian Congress approved a bill which granted Jones a 25-year contract to operate a radio station in the country.Come Up To This Mountain, Neely, Lois - Tyndale Publishers, 1980; pg. 67 As with all countries having a governing body over broadcast operations, the call letters HCJB were obtained through the government of Ecuador, beginning with the internationally allocated prefix for Ecuador's broadcast stations (HC). Station co-founders Jones and Larson advocated for, and were granted by the government, call letters that were an acronym indicative of the stations' agreed upon purpose. The result was Heralding Christ Jesus' Blessings. In Spanish (one of the original broadcast languages of the South American station) the call letters represent Hoy Cristo Jes√∫s Bendice.Come Up To This Mountain, Neely, Lois - Tyndale Publishers, 1980; pg. 77The grounds of radio station HCJB in Quito, Ecuador Jones incorporated the World Radio Missionary Fellowship, Inc. (WRMF) on March 9, 1931 as a non-profit entity and overseeing organization over HCJB. Jones was also the non-profit corporation's first president. The corporation's first officers were Adam Welty as treasurer, Ruth Churchill, secretary, and Lance Latham and his wife, Virginia, along with Howard Jones and Reuben Larson serving on the board of directors.Billy Graham Center Archives - Papers of Clarence Wesley Jones - Collection 349 HCJB's first broadcast on Christmas Day, 1931 had the potential of being heard by the six radio receivers capable of receiving the program and existing in the country at the time.Raidio.com NewsArchive article on HCJB The inaugural program was broadcast in English and Spanish from a studio in the Joneses' living room and powered by a 200-watt, table-top transmitter. The antenna used was a simple, single-wire antenna strung between two makeshift telephone poles. The broadcast lasted 30 minutes.Preparing the Soil for Global Revival: Station HCJB's Radio Circle, 1949-59; Timothy H.B. Stomenman - March, 2007 The mission expands As the mission of Radio Station HCJB grew with missionaries signing on for service in Ecuador, Jones and Larson realized a need for doctors and nurses who would also work as missionaries to care for the mission‚Äôs staff and employees. It was also decided that the same missionary medical staff would be available to attend to the needs of indigenous, Ecuadorian people who passed near the station. The first medical staff arrived in 1949, opening a small shelter and clinic. In 1955, a fully equipped modern hospital, now known as \\"Hospital Vozandes-Quito,\\" became a reality through the gifts and offerings of American listeners to ‚ÄúMorning Cheer,\\" a Christian radio program broadcast from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. With the addition of Everett Fuller, M.D. to HCJB‚Äôs medical work in 1950, Nate Saint, a young missionary working in the eastern jungle of Ecuador and affiliated with Mission Aviation Fellowship, enlisted the help of Dr. Fuller for the implementation of a medical hospital near the MAF's base at Shell Mera. Hospital Vozandes-Shell was completed in 1958 largely through gifts from listeners to the ‚ÄúBack to the Bible‚Äù radio program. Within time, HCJB‚Äôs medical ministries extended beyond established hospitals to mobile medical clinics, potable water projects and urban clinics. Organizational structure World Radio Missionary Fellowship, Inc. was officially incorporated on March 9, 1931 with Clarence Jones as the corporation's first president. At the time of the WRMF's incorporation, corporation officers were Adam Welty as treasurer, Ruth Churchill, secretary, and Lance Latham and his wife, Virginia along with Howard Jones and Reuben Larson serving on the board of directors.Billy Graham Center Archives - Papers of Clarence Wesley Jones - Collection 349 Since 1931, WRMF/HCJB Global has had seven presidents overseeing the ministry: co-founder Clarence W. Jones; co-founder Reuben Larson; co-founder D.S. Clark; Abe C. Van Der Puy; Ronald A. Cline; David Johnson; Wayne Pederson; Rev. Steve Harling became President of Reach Beyond on Sept. 1, 2016. NRB Today Newsroom Goals Mission Statement: Serving with global partners as the voice and hands of Jesus. Mission Vision: To partner with Christians in media and healthcare to bring the voice and hands of Jesus to the unreached peoples of the world. Key Distinctive: The dynamic integration of media (HCJB Global Voice) and healthcare (HCJB Global Hands) around the world to impact lives for Christ. Ministries Although HCJB began solely as a radio ministry, in recent decades it has diversified substantially with outreaches in healthcare and education as HCJB Global. *HCJB Global Hands, the mission's healthcare outreach, operates a wide variety of medical ministries. Hospital Vozandes-Quito, founded in 1955. As of 2010 this hospital has 76 beds. HCJB Global Hands is now branching out beyond Ecuador and Latin America, joining with medical partners in countries such as Malawi, the Republic of Congo, Ghana and South Africa. In recent years the mission has also sent short-term emergency medical teams to Indonesia, Pakistan, Lebanon, Peru, Mexico, Haiti and the Solomon Islands to help in relief efforts following various natural and man-made disasters. *Hospital Vozandes-Shell (Hospital Vozandes del Oriente), located in the jungle town of Shell, has provided medical services to the people of Ecuadorian Amazon since 1958. This 30-bed hospital works in close association with a ministry called Mission Aviation Fellowship which often flies patients to the hospital from the surrounding, otherwise inaccessible, communities. *Vozandes Community Development is responsible for projects in needy areas around Ecuador. These include clean water projects which aim at ensuring rural communities have access to pure water supplies, mobile medical clinics that travel to remote communities about once a month to provide dental and medical services. All of these ministries attempt to provide medical aid to those who need it while presenting a clear Christian gospel message. In 2009 HCJB Global Hands served nearly 330,000 Ecuadorians. Underlying nearly all of HCJB Global's ministries is education. Radio training is held in all five of the mission's regions. *The Christian Center of Communications (CCC) is a three-year higher education program based in Quito, Ecuador, that teaches Spanish-speaking students about radio, television and the print media. It is an accredited branch campus of Northwestern College in Roseville, Minnesota and is also accredited by Ecuadorian authorities. The mission announced recently that the school will close in 2013 after last year's freshman class graduates. *Apoyo (Spanish for \\"support\\"), is an outreach that focuses on evangelism, developing the local church and equipping Latin American church leaders to be pastors. This ministry, which began in 1992, began as a cooperative effort of HCJB Global and Leadership Resources International, but is now operated solely by HCJB Global. One of Apoyo's key projects is an intensive three-year program that trains national church leaders so they can teach others in their own countries. *The Christian Academy of the Air (formerly called Bible Institute of the Air) is operated by the World Radio Network, a cooperating ministry based in Texas. This outreach, dating back more than 50 years, focuses on teaching a wide range of classes centered on the Bible, theology and Christian ministry. *The Global Voice Institute (formerly the Radio School of Mission), first held in Singapore in 2005, is a weeklong course that provides training to broadcasters from across the Asia Pacific Region. Radio School of Mission II is the more advanced course. Radio seminars are also held in Euro-Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa/Middle East. *Corrientes (Spanish for \\"currents\\"), is a coalition of Christian ministries led by HCJB Global that officially launched on Oct. 3, 2009. This training program unifies ministries in a shared goal of mentoring bi-vocational Latin Americans for Christian service around the world.

Part of the album was recorded live and includes a dozen local musicians. Led by Raymond Raposa, this is the band's first foray into studio recording, which he described as 'a really protracted, uncomfortable process'. The release features guest-vocals by Brigit DeCook and Liz Janes. The material was partly recorded in a remote cabin in Northern California. Raposa had planned to publish a novel to accompany the album, which failed to surface.  Critical acclaim  Amanda Petrusich of Pitchfork.com compared Raposa's writing on Cathedral to that of the poet Seamus Heaney. She described the album as a collection of 'deep gothic ballads' of 'country music [that] should sound like death, and more specifically, death-by-murky-submersion'. Heather Phares of allmusic.com referred to the religious overtones of the album, describing it as 'spiritual searching' and as having 'a certain dark theatricality'. Justin Cober-Lake at popmatters.com described Cathedral as having 'lo-fi production [which] helps develop the darkness of Castanets‚Äô music. [It] sounds as if it was recorded in the desert at night, which suits the pre-technology fears of the album'. Jon Pit from Dusted Magazine called it 'another welcome installment in the folk renaissance' although he described Raposa's vocals as 'lacklustre'.

Iran joined the Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (Paris Convention) in 1959. In December 2003 Iran became a party to the Madrid Agreement and the Madrid Protocol for the International Registration of Marks. In 2005 Iran joined the Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration, which ensures the protection of geographical names associated with products. As at February 2008 Iran had yet to accede to The Hague Agreement for the Protection of Industrial Designs. Agencies responsible for IP policy in Iran * The Department of Authors, Composers and Artists at the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance is the main responsible body for copyright matters, * The Industrial Property Office at the Organization for Registration of Deeds and Estates of the Judiciary of Iran is in charge of industrial property affairs. It includes drafting copyright regulations that comply with international standards and international brand registration services. * The Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology deals with the operationalization of national technology development plans and policies, issuance of scientific certificates and examination of feasibility or industrial applicability of proposed projects and inventions. Law for the Protection of Authors, Composers and Artists Rights, 1970 Iran has a legal code to protect the proprietary and intellectual rights of works produced inside Iran called \\"Law for the Protection of Authors, Composers and Artists Rights\\", dated January 12, 1970, passed by Iran's National Consultative Assembly, supplemented with the ‚ÄúLaw for the protection of Rights of the Authors of Computer Programs‚Äù passed on (Iranian year 1379). On 22 August 2010, Iran's Islamic Consultative Assembly passed a reformation of article 12 of Law for the Protection of Authors, Composers and Artists Rights and increased the copyright length based on author's death to 50 years after death of author; this law only applies to works that were still in protection when the law passed on 22 August 2010. However these laws do not cover works from outside Iran as it is not a signatory to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works or the WIPO Copyright Treaty, or a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO). In 2012 Iran announced plans to join international conventions on the protection of literary, artistic, scientific works, including Berne Convention and Rome Convention.http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8101300907 Law of Registration of Marks and Patents, 1931 The Iranian Law of Registration of Marks and Patents of 1931 stipulates that a trademark is any type of logo, design, picture, number, letter, word, seal, wrapper, etc. that is adopted to identify and distinguish goods and services. The law provides for registration of various types of marks chosen to identify industrial, commercial or agricultural products and goods. It also provides for registration of service marks. The essential requirement is that the mark presented for registration should be distinctive. Obtaining a court injunction is a proper remedy to prevent the violation of any right secured by patent. This is provided for in the law, and the complainant can seek compensation of any damages sustained. If the violation falls under the heading of unfair competition, forgery or fraud, the perpetrator faces prosecution. Article 30 of the law provides that any inventor or discoverer who holds an unexpired patent certificate outside Iran may apply for a patent in Iran valid for the remaining duration of the original one. But if a person or firm has used the invention or discovery in Iran‚Äîwholly or partially‚Äîprior to the foreigner‚Äôs application or has made preparations to exploit the same, the foreign patentee will not have the right to stop the operation of said person or firm. Law of Registration of Patents, Industrial Designs and Trademarks, 2008 The Law of Registration of Patents, Industrial Designs and Trademarks was first passed by the Iranian parliament on 23 January 2008 for a probationary period of five years, effective from May 5, 2008. The Majlis (Parliament) also ratified a bill in May 2001 to recognize and enforce international arbitration awards, a decision designed to grant companies greater protection over their property. By acceding to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, commonly known as the New York Convention, Iran has agreed to enforce arbitration awards made in other countries. Awards issued in Iran will also be enforceable in other member countries. According to Nourlaw, the new law, unlike its predecessor gives priority to patents and industrial designs over trademarks and is substantially more scrupulous in the protection of these instruments, as it is of intellectual property rights. According to the State Registration Organization of Deeds and Properties, a total of 9,570 national inventions was registered in Iran during 2008. Compared with the previous year, there was a 38-percent increase in the number of inventions registered by the organization. Iran is neither a party to an international agreement nor has a distinct law concerning the layout designs of integrated circuits. However, as these can be regarded as an invention or an original technical work, they may be considered subject to, and thus protected by, Article 26 of the Trademarks and Patents Registration Act (1931) concerning patents or Article 2.11 of the Act on the Protection of the Rights of Authors, Composers and Artists (1970) as to the original technical works (See above). Patents Novelty: No public knowledge in Iran or abroad sufficient to put into practice. The first person to apply for the registration of an invention in accordance with the law is considered the inventor of the patent, unless proven otherwise. Types and duration: Patents are registered for 5, 10, 15 or 20 years, at the option of the applicant. Unpatentable: Pharmaceutical formula and compounds are not patentable, but a patent application can be filed for processes related to the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. In addition, any invention or improvement on an invention disturbing public order or considered to be contrary to morality or public health cannot be patented. Working: A patent will be vulnerable to cancellation if it is not worked during the five- year period following its date of granting. Although there are no explicit provisions concerning nominal working, in lieu of actual working, it is recommended that there be nominal working before the fifth anniversary of granting. Registration: In October 2007 Iran's parliament approved becoming signatory to the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) which enables patent holders in one country to register their patents in PCT member countries simply by filing a single application with the related national registration authority. To register a patent, the documents listed below must be presented to the Patent Office within six months of the date of the Iranian application. This period of duration may be renewed only once for a justifiable excuse. The applicant must present the following information: name and address; title of the invention or discovery; power of attorney duly legalized by the respective Iranian consulate; certified copy of the corresponding patent certificate (or application if benefiting from Paris Convention provisions); certified copy of the transferral document, if the applicant is not the original proprietor; and three copies of the related specifications, claims, plans and drawings. If the patent office refuses an application because of insufficient documentation or because the application is contrary to the governing provisions, the patent applicant has the legal right to refer, personally or through a lawyer, to a competent court and ask for the cancellation of the patent office decision. Copyrights Registrable: Books, pamphlets, plays and all other literary, scientific and artistic writings, irrespective of the way they are written, recorded or broadcast; audiovisual works for stage or screen performances or for broadcasting by radio and television; paintings, pictures, drawings, designs, decorative writings, geographical maps or any decorative and imaginative work produced in any simple or complex manner; sculptures of all types; architectural works, designs, sketches and buildings; photographic works produced by any original methods; original articles of applied handicraft and industrial art, carpet and rug designs; original works based on folklore and national heritage of culture and arts. Duration: The financial rights of the author are transferred to his heirs, or by covenant, for a period of 30 years after his death. In the absence of such heirs or a transfer by covenant, the Ministry of Culture and Arts will hold the rights for public use for the same period of time. In July 2010, the Iranian Parliament (Majlis) modified the country's copyright law, granting authors or creators of an original work permanent right to copy, distribute and adapt the work. Trademarks Types and duration: A trademark may be registered for ten years, renewable indefinitely for additional ten-year periods. Legal effect: Registration gives an owner the exclusive right to use a trademark on the goods for which the trademark is registered. The owner may prevent other parties from using the trademark on competing products. Any trademark, whether already registered or being presented for registration, may be contested by the person who 0claims that it belongs to him, or that the resemblance is so close that it may mislead the consumer. Any opposition to the registration of a trademark on the grounds of prior use or close resemblance, and/or claims relating to the infringement of a registered trademark, may be filed with the General Courts of Tehran. The right to contest a trademark is in force for three years, starting from the actual date of its registration. The registered trademark then becomes incontestable in the courts. The proprietor is entitled to take civil legal actions and/or lodge complaints involving legal penalties to prevent third parties from infringing his right of ownership. Remedies may include damages, costs, and an injunction preventing further violations. Under Articles 529 and 530 of the Islamic Penal Code (Taazirat), commission of forgery or unauthorized use of registered trademarks incurs civil liabilities and imprisonment of up to two years. Punishment for the forgery of trademarks of governmental and municipal companies and establishment as well as using such forged trademarks varies from 3‚Äì15 years and from six months to three years of imprisonment, respectively. Not registrable: The official flag of Iran; any flag that the government has prohibited to be used as a trademark; badges, medals and insignia of the Iranian government; marks of official institutions such as the Iranian Red Crescent or the International Red Cross; words and/or phrases creating an impression of official connection with Iranian authorities; marks contrary to public order and public morals (the standard for this is tougher in Iran than in most other countries); and marks that so closely resemble an already registered mark that it would cause confusion or deceive consumers. Working: If a trademark has not been used in Iran or abroad within three years from the registration date and if the owner or his legal representative fails to furnish a valid reason, any interested party may apply to the court and request cancellation of trademark. Registration: To register a trademark, an applicant (Iranian or foreign) should refer in person or through an attorney to the Registration Office for Industrial Property, in Tehran, and file a request for obtaining a certificate of trademark registration. Applications are published in the official gazette so that interested parties may inspect and, if needed, contest them. The registrar examines applications for format, content and consistency in compliance with the relevant rules of registration. If the registrar rejects an application, the applicant may appeal in court. In addition, the office formally examines trademark applications for any conflict with previously registered trademarks or applications and for compliance with Iranian patent and trademark law. Resemblance of a trademark to a previously registered mark or application takes into account appearance, pronunciation, form of writing or any other similarity. To register a trademark, the applicant must present the following information: full name and address of applicant(s); power of attorney duly recognized by the Iranian Consulate (a single power of attorney is sufficient for all trademarks); details of the trademark, presented with 12 samples; specifications of goods and classes (according to International Classification). Plant Variety Protection Act, 2003 In order to protect plant varieties, a distinct legislation entitled was adopted in 2003. In accordance with the Act on the Registration of Plant Varieties and the Control and Certification of Seed and Plant, plant varieties which are deemed new, can be registered and protected. Further, by virtue of Article 5 of the Act, cultivated plant varieties are granted protection and the exclusive right of economic exploitation thereof is accorded to their breeders for 18 years at most. Protection of Geographical Indications Act, 2004 The use of a Geographical Indications may act as a certification that the product possesses certain qualities, or enjoys a certain reputation, due to its geographical origin. Licensing and franchising There are numerous associations that assist in matching licensers and franchisers with local partners. The most important of these is the Iran Chamber of Commerce Industries and Mines. Another important point of reference is the Internet-based Iran Trade Point Network, which provides information on locating local partners. Failure to observe the Copyright Law has prevented overseas companies from investing in Iran‚Äôs software industry.Iran daily: Software Exports Opportunities & Challenges E-commerce The Iranian Parliament adopted the Electronic Commerce Law in 2004. Articles 62‚Äì66 of this law specify that Iran‚Äôs existing intellectual-property laws apply to all electronic transactions. Articles 62 and 63 deal with the protection of authors‚Äô rights; Articles 64 and 65 ensure the protection of trade secrets; and Article 66 protects trademarks and domain names. International conventions Protection of Cultural Property Iran ratified the Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (The Hague, 14 May 1954.) in 1959 and the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (Paris, 14 November 1970.) in 1975, and agreed to the Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (Paris, 16 November 1972) and to the Second Protocol to the Hague Convention of 1954 for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. (The Hague, 26 March 1999) in 2005. Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (a.k.a. the Paris Convention), 1959 Iran is a signatory to the International Convention for Protection of Industrial Property (also known as the Paris Convention). The Paris Convention requires Iran to grant the same protection to the industrial property of the nationals of the members of the treaty as to that of Iranians. World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), 2002 Iran is a member of the WIPO since 2002 and has acceded to several WIPO intellectual property treaties. However, Iran is not a signatory to the WIPO Copyright Treaty. As per WIPO's report titled \\"World Intellectual Property Indicators 2013\\", Iran ranked 90th for patents generated by Iranian nationals all over the world, 100th in industrial design and 82nd in trademarks, positioning Iran below Jordan and Venezuela in this regard but above Yemen and Jamaica. Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks, 2003 The Council of Ministers passed Decree H24305T/6921 in December 2003, ratifying Iran‚Äôs accession to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks and its protocol. In accordance with the agreement, nationals of any contracting country may secure protection for their marks in all the other acceding countries by registering them with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration, 2005 In 2005 Iran joined the Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration, which ensures the protection of geographical names associated with products. The Lisbon Agreement went into force in March 2006. As a direct consequence, Iran‚Äôs Customs Administration has banned the import of goods that are produced overseas but bear Iranian brand names. WTO copyright laws Iran's government has not agreed to be bound by WTO copyright laws, endorsing the free distribution of unlicensed software in massive quantities. Linux, freely reproducible even in countries with strong Intellectual Property (IP) laws, is also growing in popularity within Iran, however. Iran may change this status if and when it becomes a full member of WTO, as WTO members are encouraged to abide by WTO copyright regulations. However, the United States has previously vetoed Iran's ascension to the WTO 22 times, and actively refuses to support Iran's full membership in the WTO. Thus, as a matter of reciprocity, Iran has determined that its interests are not served by observing WTO copyright treaties, and has thus exercised its sovereign right not to alter its laws, thereby making certain foreign copyrights unenforced by Iranian authorities, in theory, or in practice. Iranian pharmaceutical manufacturers are disadvantaged by the government's poor intellectual property protection regime. Developing a molecule for combination therapies may qualify for patent protection in other countries. However, while weak patent law adherence continues in Iran, it is expected this will create significant barriers for Iranian companies prospecting trade on the global market.

The Times. According to Henry Jenner, the level of his ability in the language is unclear, but was probably restricted to a few words and phrases.Jenner, p. 23. A song attributed to Davey's memory, the \\"Cranken Rhyme\\", is not known from any earlier source and is notable as possibly one of the last survivals of Cornish literary tradition.Murdoch, p. 142. History Davey lived in the village of Boswednack in Zennor parish. A farmer who served as a schoolmaster in Zennor for a period,Ellis, p. 129. he reputedly learned his Cornish from his father.Matthews, p. 404. He died in 1891, aged 79, taking his knowledge with him. John Hobson Matthews mentions Davey in his History of St. Ives, Lelant, Towednack, and Zennor, published in 1892, the year after Davey's death. In a chapter discussing Cornish and the evidence of its late survival in the region, Matthews indicates that Davey had had some knowledge of the tongue, could decipher local Cornish placenames, and could \\"converse on a few simple topics in the ancient language\\". However, he records only one example of Davey's speech, and is unclear as to whether he had heard Davey speak in person, or was relying on second-hand accounts. Additionally, while Davey's reputation as a receptacle of Cornish was well known in the area, none of his neighbours or descendants learned or recorded any of it. As such it is difficult to judge the accuracy of Matthews' claims or to gauge how much knowledge of the tongue Davey might actually have had. Davey is known to have had a copy of William Pryce's 1790 Cornish work Archaeologia Cornu-Britannica, which he inherited from his father. As such it is possible that he acquired some part of his Cornish through studying ‚Äì or memorising ‚Äì Pryce. However, the piece of Cornish recorded by Matthews, the song known as the \\"Cranken Rhyme\\", does not appear in Pryce or any other known text, showing that he had some \\"original\\" Cornish that he may indeed have learned traditionally from his father. As such he is an important figure in the study of Cornish in its last stages, along with Chesten Marchant (died 1676) and Dolly Pentreath (died 1777), judged by various scholars to be the last monoglot and native speakers of Cornish respectively. Matthews could make nothing of the \\"Cranken Rhyme\\", regarding it as seemingly a \\"mere jumble of place-names.\\".Matthews, p. 405. However, Robert Morton Nance amended Matthews' spelling into a comprehensible form, and offered a translation.Nance, pp. 146‚Äì153. By Nance's emendation, the song is a brief piece of humour, comparing the fertility of the rocky fields of Cranken unfavourably to a road. A memorial stone at Zennor church was erected by the St Ives Old Cornwall Society. The inscription describes Davey as \\"the last to possess any traditional considerable knowledge of the Cornish Language\\", and contains a Cornish quotation from the Book of Proverbs: \\"The words of wise men are as a deep pool, a flowing stream ‚Äì a fountain of life\\". There is some evidence that at least three individuals with some knowledge of Cornish outlived John Davey: Jacob Care of St Ives (d. 1892); Elizabeth Vingoe of Higher Boswarva, Madron (d. 1903 and who taught at least some Cornish to her son); and John Mann, who was interviewed in his St Just home by Richard Hall (Elizabeth Vingoe's nephew) in 1914, when Mann was 80. He told Hall that, when a child in Boswednack, Zennor, he and several other children always conversed in Cornish while at play together. This would have been around 1840‚Äì1850. They would certainly have known Cornish speaker Anne Berryman (1766‚Äì1854), also of Boswednack.Rod Lyon, Cornish ‚Äì The Struggle for Survival, 2001 Notes References *Bruxelles, Simon de (21 May 2008). \\"After centuries, Cornish agree how to speak their language\\".

He was invested as a member of the Privy Council of Ireland, but was ejected from it in 1767 by Lord Townshend, the newly arrived Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, who wished to make a \\"clean sweep\\" of the Irish administration, removing all those he regarded as corrupt or inefficient. On 23 April 1759 Lord Athenry was created Earl of Louth in the Peerage of Ireland, a title previously held by John de Bermingham, 1st Earl of Louth, a cousin of his remote ancestor Rickard de Bermingham.

As they tell the story of The Hookman, the player takes the role of Christine, a young woman who has a romantic getaway planned for her and her boyfriend Patrick. When she arrives at the cabin of her parents, she finds out the lights are out. After fixing window shutters and replacing fuses, she finds the whole house has been ransacked. She hears on the radio news that an assassin known as the Hookman has escaped, and calls the police to report the break-in at her parent's cabin. The policeman is rude and tells her it will take a few hours to get to her. When her boyfriend Patrick arrives, he dismisses her fears about the serial killer, and drives the two of them into the forest for a romantic campfire. Patrick disappears to get firewood and cocoa. While he is gone, someone damages the car. She sets out to repair it and search for Patrick. She discovers that her father and a fellow scientist (who lost his family in tragic accidents) were working on a formula that regenerates dead tissue.

James Madison's birthplace, see Belle Grove (Port Conway, Virginia). :For other Belle Groves, see Belle Grove (disambiguation). Belle Grove Plantation is a late-18th-century plantation house and estate in the northern Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, USA. It is situated in Frederick County, about a mile southwest of Middletown. Built between 1794 and 1797, the large Federal-style manor house is a National Historic Landmark and was opened to the public by its owners, the National Trust for Historic Preservation (NTHP), as a historic house museum in 1967. In 2002, Belle Grove became part of the Cedar Creek and Belle Grove National Historical Park, a National Park Service unit, although it continues to be owned and operated by the NTHP. It is part of a U.S. National Historic Landmark, the Cedar Creek Battlefield and Belle Grove Plantation. Belle Grove is also designated a Virginia Historic Landmark and, as part of \\"Cedar Creek Battlefield and Belle Grove\\", is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Historically important as the home of revolutionary veteran Major Isaac Hite, Jr ‚Äì President James Madison‚Äôs brother-in-law ‚Äì and as the headquarters of General Philip Sheridan during the Battle of Cedar Creek (1864), the manor house has been little altered over the centuries and remains one of the best preserved 18th century homes in the country.Anonymous (2000), A Guide to Belle Grove Plantation, Fort Valley, Virginia: AAH Graphics, pp 5‚Äì8. Affording grand vistas of the surrounding Shenandoah Valley, Blue Ridge and Alleghenies, the estate is situated on 283 acres of Maj. Hite‚Äôs original 483 acres. (The entire CCBGNHP, including the nearby battlefield, consists of 3,593 acres.) Grounds Belle Grove's plantation grounds include the large limestone manor house (which accommodates the visitor's center in its basement), an 1815 icehouse and smokehouse, a slave cemetery, a \\"heritage orchard\\", and a demonstration garden designed by the Garden Club of Virginia. At the entrance to the plantation is a monument erected in 1919 in memory of Stephen Dodson Ramseur, a Confederate general who died at the plantation in 1864 following the Battle of Belle Grove. Manor house Exterior: The symmetrical main block (which excludes the single west wing, added in 1815) consists of three stories: a basement, a piano nobile main floor, and an attic half-story. The corners are decorated with quoins. The front (south) elevation, which is the only one in which the limestone is finished, consists of seven bays: six with main floor windows (the extreme right and left are double width) and the center one with the main entry. Twelve steps ascend the elevated front portico, with its prominent pediment and four Tuscan-style columns, which encompasses the three central bays ‚Äì of which the middle one has the main door and door surround, framed by two pilasters also of the Tuscan order. This main block originally had neo- classical-style porticos on all four sides, but today only the front and back (south and north) porticos survive. Interior: The interior is notable for its fine woodwork in a transitional style ranging from Georgian to Federal. History Jost Hite ‚Äì grandfather of Major Isaac Hite, Jr ‚Äì was a German immigrant to the Shenandoah Valley. In 1732, Jost and his partner Robert McKay, along with 16 other families, journeyed via the Valley Pike into the northern Valley to settle on acquired through two land grants. One of Jost's sons ‚Äì Isaac Hite, Sr ‚Äì purchased in 1748, and another in 1770, just southwest of Middletown. Together, these would become the Belle Grove Plantation. The first house on the Belle Grove site (a large limestone structure later called the ‚ÄúOld Hall‚Äù) was built for a tenant farmer around 1750. (Its foundations are still visible adjacent to the smokehouse.) Isaac, Jr, attended College of William & Mary and served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Upon their marriage in 1783, Isaac, Sr, gave his son and daughter-in-law ‚Äì Nelly Conway Madison, sister of the future President ‚Äì the Belle Grove house and grounds. In 1794, construction began on the new mansion, which was completed in three years. It was constructed of local limestone quarried on the property, and, according to prevailing custom, was intended to display the owners' high social and financial status. Thomas Jefferson, through the agency of his friend James Madison, made a number of suggestions to the architect which strongly influenced the final design. Madison is known to have visited the plantation several times, even staying in the \\"Old Hall\\" (before the larger house was built) during his own honeymoon in 1794. After Nelly's death (1802), Major Hite married Ann Tunstall Maury. Of the three children born to the first marriage and the ten to the second, all but one lived into adulthood. In 1815, an addition was made at the west end of the house realizing the facade that exists today. As his grain and livestock holdings grew, Maj. Hite expanded his estate to include a total of of land and 103 slave workers. He eventually owned and operated a general store, grist- mill, saw-mill and distillery. After his death (1836), and that of Ann (1851), Belle Grove Plantation was sold out of the family. By the start of the Civil War, the estate no longer existed as it had during the Hite family era. There was a succession of owners before the Brumback family purchased the property in 1907. The Brumbacks operated an inn there in the 1920s, but sold it to Francis Welles Hunnewell of Wellesley, Massachusetts in 1929. These 20th- century owners altered the house very little. With professional assistance, Mr. Hunnewell had the house carefully restored in the 1930s and 1940s. Upon his death in 1964, he bequeathed the house, 100 surrounding acres, and an endowment of $100,000 to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Belle Grove was opened as a house museum in 1967 and has been open to the public, as well as remaining a working farm, ever since.

History The origin of St. Mary's Catholic School began as a dream of ten Catholic families who formed the members of the St. Mary's Separate School Board in 1900. By 1901, the first stage of a two- classroom elementary school was built. Remodelling was done in 1913 to provide for two more classrooms to accommodate the growing enrolment of 113 students. However, by 1953 enrolment had grown to 162, and the first formal two-room addition was added in 1956. Two more rooms were added in 1958. In 1962, enrolment had grown to an overwhelming 317 and the purchase of portable classrooms became the norm. Expanding Catholic education into the early years of secondary school was realized in 1981. St. Mary's Junior High School was founded and students were given the opportunity of continuing with Catholic education up to the end of Grade 10. With the passage of Bill 30 in 1984, full funding for Catholic education allowed for the extension of the junior high concept and St. Mary's Catholic High School was now a reality. The students entering Grade 9 in the 1984‚Äì85 school year began the pioneering work of becoming the first graduating class. In the fall of 1987, the first St. Mary's Catholic High School graduation was held with Bishop Sherlock presiding. The original graduating class consisted of 12 students who braved the new world of Catholic High School education and survived. By 1988, St. Mary's Catholic High School was now a full-fledged secondary school offering courses in Grades 9-12. In 1997, St. Mary's Catholic High School enrolment of 500 plus had outgrown the school building on Oxford Street and the school moved to the current facility located on Juliana Drive. The momentous opening was officiated by Most Rev. John Sherlock, Bishop of London. Within one year of moving, the population had grown to 800 and a twelve classroom addition was built. The school's continued growth necessitated another addition of science labs, technology rooms and specialty rooms.http://www.ldcsb.on.ca/schools/SMH/AboutUs/SchoolHistory/Documents/School%20Profile%20History.pdf References External links * Category:Catholic secondary schools in Ontario Category:High schools in Oxford County, Ontario Category:Woodstock, Ontario Category:Educational institutions established in 1984 Category:1984 establishments in Ontario ","title":"St. Mary's Catholic High School (Woodstock, Ontario)"},{"id":"24681497","text":"The Spaghetti Western Orchestra, formerly the Ennio Morricone Experience, is a quintet of musicians who perform music from spaghetti westerns, especially the music of Ennio Morricone.

He was usually credited as \\"Barretico\\" during the 1950s and 1960s. He was also known as \\"El Loro\\" (The Parrot) and \\"Pata de loro\\" (Parrot leg) \\"due to his constant chatter and parrotlike walk\\", a nickname given to him by Rita Montaner according to Paquito D'Rivera. Biography Early life and career Barreto was born in Havana on August 11, 1929. His father was Primo Barreto, a clarinetist who taught music to all of his children: Lita, Josefina, Estela, Alejandro \\"Coco\\", Roberto \\"Bobby\\", and Guillermo. As a young man, Guillermo became a skilled interpreter of Cuban pailas. In the 1940s, he was part of several big bands: the Cabaret Tropicana resident orchestra (directed by Obdulio Morales), the Sans Souci resident orchestra (directed by Rafael Ortega) and Armando Romeu Gonz√°lez's orchestra. Soon he was playing his own arrangements and compositions. Between 1943 and 1946, he studied piano under the supervision of Rafael Ortega. This swing background would allow him to take his music into the realm of Afro-Cuban jazz as part of the Quinteto Instrumental de M√∫sica Moderna, which he founded in 1958 alongside Frank Emilio Flynn. He was so highly regarded that during a visit to Cuba by Stan Kenton's orchestra, Guillermo replaced an ill Buddy Rich for one night's performance.Tommy Dorsey: Livin' In A Great Big Way: A Biography - Peter J. Levinson  Descarga and Afro-Cuban jazz  Inspired by bop drummers like Max Roach and Roy Haynes, by the early 1950s, Guillermo would organize the Sunday afternoon jam sessions (known as descargas) at the legendary Cabaret Tropicana (featuring stars such as Bebo Vald√©s), often doing the transcription necessary to explain American jazz music to his band mates to play.Havana In The 1950s: Leonardo Acosta -cubanow.net He played in Cachao's famous 1957 sessions, and in 1959 the first Quinteto Instrumental de M√∫sica Moderna LP came out under the name Grupo Cubano de M√∫sica Moderna. By the early 1960s, he was amongst the most prolific drummers in the Cuban jazz scene, playing with the likes of Chucho Vald√©s, Fernando Mulens, Peruch√≠n and, since 1967, the all-star big band known as Orquesta Cubana de M√∫sica Moderna. The Quinteto Instrumental de M√∫sica Moderna, \\"which quickly gained stature as a benchmark in Cuban Latin jazz history\\",Leonardo Acosta: Roots of Latin Jazz - A Century of Jazz in Cuba would later evolve into Los Amigos in the 1980s. The band would include guest musicians such as Miguel O'Farrill and Elio Vald√©s, and they backed singer Merceditas Vald√©s, Barreto's wife since the late 1950s. Friends with another younger Cuban drummer, Hilario Dur√°n, (Hilario worked with Guillermo in the Orquesta Cubana de M√∫sica Moderna) in 1991, he introduced Hilario to the Canadian flautist Jane Bunnett. Both men then went on to appear on her famous Afro-Cuban recording Spirits of Havana.  Death  On December 14, 1991, two months after the recording of Spirits of Havana, Barreto died in his hometown, Havana. His wife died on June 13, 1996.

Based on the similarly-themed, former fireworks show HalloWishes at Magic Kingdom, Halloween Screams is hosted by Jack Skellington and features appearances from Disney Villains and music from Disney animated features. History The show was produced by Walt Disney Creative Entertainment, and its development was supervised by Steven Davison and designer Eric Tucker. This display was held nightly in 2009, during Disneyland's Halloween Time Celebration. The show is similar to that of Walt Disney World Resort's HalloWishes and uses portions of the show's audio. The Anaheim version differs in that it is hosted by Jack Skellington from Tim Burton‚Äôs The Nightmare Before Christmas. The show ran from September 25, 2009 to November 1, 2009 (the duration of Halloween Time at the Disneyland Resort) and since 2010, it ran exclusively for Mickey's Halloween Party until 2018. On non-party nights, the current Disney fireworks show runs unless Halloween Screams was cancelled due to winds or other issues the night before and must be presented as the fireworks can't be removed from their tubes in the event of a cancellation. Beginning in 2019, when Halloween Party moved to Disney California Adventure, the fireworks spectacular will be running again for public showing for the first time since its opening year. In the 2019 season, the show was modified to run like Mickey's Mix Magic only having fireworks during select evenings and run projection only on other nights. On the select nights where there was high winds or weather issues which forced to cancel the fireworks part of the show, a B-show consisted of all-new low level pyrotechnics and small sized firework shells would be introduced. On other occasions, the show can still played even without fireworks as well. Show summary The show opens with the overture from Tim Burton‚Äôs The Nightmare Before Christmas, an instrumental medley of songs from the film including \\"What\`s This?\\" and \\"Making Christmas\\". Zero (Jack Skellington‚Äôs dog from the film) flies above Sleeping Beauty Castle. He is shortly joined by Jack, or rather his head (in the form of projection onto a sphere shaped balloon), located on the upper left of the castle. These projections can also be viewed along the Rivers of America, which recycle the mist screens used in Fantasmic!. There are only searchlights and projection mapping used in the show's introduction. No actual pyrotechnics are used for the first two minutes. Jack and Zero fade into the night and the first pyrotechnics are launched when \\"Grim Grinning Ghosts\\", from the Disneyland attraction the Haunted Mansion, begins to play. Projections of rising ghosts make an appearance on the castle. The music from \\"Grim Grinning Ghosts\\" changes to an upbeat pop tempo, as synchronized isobar flames, shoot up from both sides of the castle. Then the mood is set with \\"This is Halloween\\" from The Nightmare Before Christmas. Then Disney's most infamous villains begin to arrive, beginning with Ursula (from The Little Mermaid). The guests are serenaded with a montage of Disney's most spookiest music. Later, Oogie Boogie (from The Nightmare Before Christmas) soon follows, and arriving last is Maleficent (from Sleeping Beauty), showing guests how Halloween should really be celebrated. The party ends with Jack and Zero initiating the \\"scream-along\\" grand finale.

Voice cast * Chris Sarandon as Jack Skellington * Pat Carroll as Ursula the Sea Witch * Ken Page as Oogie Boogie * Susan Blakeslee as Maleficent Miscellaneous The projections used on the sphere to the upper left of the castle were later used as projections on the Fantasmic! mist screens at the Rivers of America during the show. The decision to have video playback during the fireworks was made in October 2009. In 2015, the projectors installed for Disneyland Forever at the castle were also utilized. Not only are they an addition to the show, they are also used to project various images during the party hours. Projections used on the sphere were modified as well. In 2018, the last year of the show exclusive to Mickey's Halloween Party, the projections were expanded to across the park with Main Street U.S.A. now using the projection mapping and searchlights to accommodate the show's viewing. The show was formerly only performed during Mickey's Halloween Party, for party guests only. On occasions where the show is cancelled during the Halloween Party, the show is presented the next night, even if this is not a party night, as the fireworks cannot be taken out from the launch tubes to be saved for another night. The 2019 showing of the show was the first public showing in decades since the opening year in 2009 after Halloween Party moved to Disney California Adventure. The show saw many changes: * In Sleeping Beauty Castle, Main Street USA, and It's a Small World, there are new projections in many scenes of the show. * In Rivers of America, the show was enhanced and utilized with fountains, lasers, new projections in the area, and searchlights, which were also used for many firework shows such as Together Forever (first firework show to have this technology), Believe... In Holiday Magic, Mickey's Mix Magic, and 2019 version of Disneyland Forever. * There were more fireworks than in the previous year of showing for select nights (mainly Friday to Sunday) and more of lasers (albeit without fireworks) which were used in other weeknights.

It originally aired on October 15, 2009 on NBC. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) becomes convinced that an insurance salesman visiting the office is a part of the Mafia, and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) accompany Michael to a meeting with him. Meanwhile, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) accidentally cancels Jim's credit card, while Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) are on their honeymoon in Puerto Rico. It was written by Brent Forrester and directed by David Rogers. \\"Mafia\\" received positive reviews from critics and was viewed by an estimated 8.03 million viewers and received a 4.1/10 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Synopsis Michael Scott (Steve Carell) meets with a tenacious but not overly skilled insurance salesman named Angelo Grotti (guest star Mike Starr) in the office and is later convinced by Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) that he is part of the Mafia and also by the fact that Grotti's surname sounds very familiar to John Gotti. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) tries to convince them otherwise to no avail, and later notes that since Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) are on their honeymoon in Puerto Rico, and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) has \\"checked out\\", the \\"coalition for reason\\" in the office is very weak. Oscar calls them about the situation but Pam pointedly reminds him that they are on their honeymoon and should not be bothered unless it's a dire emergency. Michael calls for a lunch meeting with Grotti, convinced by Dwight and Andy to meet him in a public place where Grotti cannot become violent. Dwight and Andy accompany him to the meeting, Andy disguised as a mechanic and bearing a tire iron so he can defend Michael; though this backfires on him when he cannot fix a woman's car and ends up breaking it further. Michael interprets Grotti's insurance pitches as veiled threats, and frightened, signs a deal with him. However, Michael cannot afford the policy, so he calls Jim for help. Jim briefly pranks him by pretending to cut out before telling him to not call him on his honeymoon again. Michael also consults Oscar, who tells him to simply cancel the insurance, but Michael is too intimidated to do so and becomes despondent. Discontent at seeing Michael with his spirit broken and facing financial ruin, Dwight and Andy resolve that they have to get him to stand up to Grotti. They tell Michael that Grotti was just pretending to be part of the Mafia to con Michael into a deal. Enraged, Michael calls Grotti, chews him out for his \\"threats\\", and tells him to cancel the deal. After he hangs up, Dwight and Andy admit their deception and congratulate Michael on standing up to the Mafia. Michael is too elated by his accomplishment to be mad at Dwight and Andy for lying to him, and eagerly recounts his conversation with Grotti to the rest of the office. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) uses Jim's office to pass gas in and eventually sets up a temporary workspace in there. Jim's credit card company calls his office phone inquiring about some unusual charges and Kevin, worried someone might have stolen Jim's card, uses one of Jim's pay stubs to give them his address and social security number. They say that there have been charges that occurred in Puerto Rico and that they will cancel his card. Kevin realizes his mistake and tries to stop them, but to no avail, and Oscar tells Kevin he just committed identity fraud. At the end of the episode, Kevin calls Pam to confirm that they do not suspect that he is behind Jim's credit card being cancelled; after Pam angrily cuts off the call, Kevin cheerfully notes \\"they have no idea what happened\\". Production The episode was written by Brent Forrester, his first writing credit for the season and seventh writing credit for the series. The episode was directed by David Rogers, his first directing credit for the season and second for the series. The episode originally aired October 15, 2009 on NBC as the sixth episode of the sixth season and the 106th episode of the series in all. The episode also guest stars Mike Starr as Grotti, the Insurance salesman.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1520196/fullcredits#cast Internet Movie Database Retrieved June 9, 2010 The plot of the episode was revealed by executive producer of The Office, Paul Lieberstein, at the Television Critics Association press tour.Keller, Joel (August 8, 2009) http://www.tvsquad.com/2009/08/08/an-office-wedding-and-michael-scott-talks- to-the-mafia-tc/ TV Squad Retrieved June 9, 2010 Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Mafia\\" was viewed by 8.03 million viewers, with a 4.1 rating and a 10 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic coming second in its timeslot after Grey's Anatomy going down seven-tenths from last week's episode, \\"Niagara\\" according to the Nielsen Media Research. Dan Phillips of IGN gave the episode an 8.8 saying it was \\"great\\" and \\"Mafia\\" isn't one of the show's greatest episodes, but it is a highly enjoyable one.

ISSN 1368-485X Development Flightstar IISL e-Spyder The Rotax 503 engine installation on a Flightstar II Flightstar IISC Flightstar designer Tom Peghiny built the first Flightstar in the mid-1980s for the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category with its maximum empty weight requirement. The two-seat Flightstar II soon followed to fill the role of a trainer. The designs quickly became commercial successes and the basic design has been extensively developed over time. By 2007 over 700 single seaters had been sold. All models are constructed from anodized aluminum tubing assembled with bolts. The fuselage is suspended from a keel tube that also mounts the engine at the front, the tail at the back and the wings. The wings are strut-braced and utilize jury struts. The wings and tail surfaces are covered in pre-sewn Dacron envelopes, which reduces construction time. The wings have full-span ailerons, while the tail features conventional elevators and rudder. The landing gear is a tricycle gear arrangement with bungee suspension on the main wheels. The nosewheel is steerable and mainwheel brakes are an available option. The reported construction time for the single seat models is 100 hours. The fuselage is built around an overhead aluminum tube keel that mounts the tail at the back, the wings and fuselage in the centre and the engine at the front. The pod-type cockpit fairing is made from fibreglass and includes a windshield. The two seat models all have side-by- side seating and have folding wings. Reported construction time for the current two seat models is 150 hours. Reviewer Andre Cliche described the Flightstar line as: \\"a strong ultralight that is built to last\\" and particularly singled out the control system for praise saying: \\"the controls are well-balanced, light and authoritative.\\" In July 2009 a new single seat model was exhibited at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh. The e-Spyder is an electric- powered version of the Sportstar Spyder, developed by Tom Peghiny. The aircraft replaces the Spyder's two-stroke engine with a Yuneec Power Drive 20 electric motor and two Lithium polymer battery packs which provide a 40-minute endurance. The aircraft is intended to be developed into a commercially available kit and forecast to be available for under US$25,000. The aircraft are also produced under licence in India by Albatross Flying Systems.

Simon graduated from the Bronx High School of Science and earned a degree in accounting from the City College of New York in 1949. He then served in the US Army where he was stationed at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indianapolis in 1953. He supplemented his army pay working as a door-to-door encyclopedia salesman. After leaving the military, he decided to stay in Indianapolis and took a job as a leasing agent where he saw the potential in real estate. Career Real estate After a few years as a leasing agent and having handled leasing at several shopping centers, he formed his own leasing company in 1959 with his younger brother Herb, Melvin Simon & Associates. Melvin owned 2/3rd of the business and Herb the remainder. They started out by developing strip centers anchored by groceries and drugstores; they soon graduated to developing fully enclosed malls. By 1967, they owned and operated more than 3 million square feet of retail property and expanded nationally. His oldest brother Fred Simon joined the business and became the longtime leasing director at Simon Property Group. The Simons followed a very successful strategy. They would entice a large anchor tenant, typically a department store, to their planned mall by charging them less rent and then would use the contract to obtain bank financing for the construction usually with minimal investment from the Simons. Once the project was completed, the Simons would charge smaller stores a higher rate and also required that stores pay a premium over their rent if their sales exceeded pre-negotiated levels. In 1993, Melvin Simon & Associates went public as the Simon Property Group raising $1 billion for the Simon brothers. At the time, this was the largest real estate stock offering ever made. In 1996, the company merged with the DeBartolo Realty Corporation in a $3.0 billion merger becoming the Simon DeBartolo Group. In 1998, the company reverted to the Simon Property Group name and maintains its title as the largest mall operator in the United States, owning 386 properties in North America, Europe and Asia; clocking 2.8 billion shopper visits each year, and having annual sales in excess of $60 billion. The company, although publicly held, remained controlled by the Simon brothers. Movies In the 1970s, Simon expanded into producing films with Melvin Simon Productions but ended up losing millions of dollars in what he later called a \\"big mistake\\". He produced the 1982 adolescent comedy Porky's. Movies produced by Melvin Simon Productions: Indiana Pacers In 1983, the Simons bought the NBA franchise, the Indiana Pacers.

Biography  Born in Milan, the son of Enzo Mainardi, he graduated in 1956 in biology in Parma. From 1967 to 1992 he taught zoology, and then biology and ethology at the University of Parma, in the Science and Medicine faculties. From 1973 he directed the School of Ethology of the Scientific cultural center Ettore Majorana in Erice. He taught Ethology of Behaviour at the Ca' Foscari University of Venice. He was national president of LIPU (Lega italiana protezione uccelli, Italian League for the defence of birds, founded in 1965 and Italian partner of Birdlife International), and later became its honorary president. Mainardi studied the social and sexual behaviour of animals, and its evolution, starting from the relationships between parents and offspring (particularly the importance of the \\"imprinting\\"). His studies demonstrate that also the animals can transmit - to a certain extent - the capacity to transfer solution to problems from one individual to another: the process of innovation according to Mainardi's results is not exclusive of mankind. He directed the Italian Journal of Zoology, organ of the Italian Zoological association (Unione Zoologica italiana). Besides his researches and teachings, he was most popular in Italy as a regular and appreciated guest at various scientific TV programs, such as Dalla parte degli animali (On the animals' side), and the scientific series Quark, the first show of the kind in Italy aimed at a general public, created in 1981 by Italian journalist Piero Angela. Since the beginnings, Mainardi was a regular contributor to Quark, cooperating with Piero Angela to spread the interest for the scientific matters, making a point in using the simplest possible language even for complex subjects, to reach every spectator. He was an atheist, and president of Union of Rationalist Atheists and Agnostics. Mainardi also contributed to several Italian major newspaper, such as the Corriere della Sera, and has written more than 200 publications and books.

One of the earliest Irish \\"slum dramas\\", it focuses on the horrific conditions prevalent in Dublin's tenements and the ineffectuality of the medical and charitable institutions set up to combat them. The message of the play reflects Gogarty's belief that only a complete overhaul of the Dublin housing system, coupled with a more effective campaign of preventive medicine, were capable of producing positive change. Gogarty's friend Joseph O'Connor, though not involved in the actual writing process, contributed some anecdotal material to the play, and when it was first performed at the Abbey Theatre in December 1917, the name of the author was given as \\"Alpha and Omega\\", a joint pseudonym referring to Gogarty and O'Connor. Background A medical doctor as well as a writer, Oliver Gogarty was deeply troubled by the state of housing in urban Dublin. After joining the staff of the Meath Hospital in 1911, he began to speak out about the health hazards posed by Dublin schools and tenements. In one 1913 letter he asked: \\"Does a tenement only cease to be a tenement, when it becomes a tomb? The houses in Church Street, as elsewhere, have the saving attribute of killing only one generation or part of a generation... but what of the houses of Church Street, the houses of six and seven feet high, that cannot fall, but can only go on reeking forever. The houses in Kean's Court‚Äîwhat of those? And what of those structures in Thunder's Court, where one common privy bemerded beyond use, stands beside one common water supply which a corporation notice guards from waste.\\" Believing that the Dublin Corporation was to blame for the current state of affairs, he also called for a list of slum property-holders to be published because \\"we are dealing with a form of property so injurious to public health and public morals, that it should be made accordingly publicly responsible.\\"Carens, p. 41 This sense of outrage was to remain with Gogarty his whole life; as a senator, he made twenty-seven separate speeches on housing in a single year. John Wyse Jackson and Peter Costello have argued that Gogarty's portrayal of the Foley family was at least partially inspired by visits to the home of his friend, James Joyce. Though not tenement dwellers, the Joyces' situation was impoverished, and Gogarty was later to describe their house in Cabra as \\"a miserable home\\". Similarities can be detected between the clever, idle schemer \\"Stanislaus Tully\\" and Joyce's father, John Stanislaus Joyce. James Carens has also noted that Gogarty gives \\"the affectations of his Ely Place neighbors, George Moore and Sir Thornley Stoker\\" to two of the Townsend Thanatorium's board members.Carens, p. 43 Plot The story of Blight centres on the character of Stanislaus Tully, a Dublin labourer who has been injured on the job and is hoping to receive damages from the courts. He has greatly over-exaggerated the extent of his injuries to reap the largest monetary award possible, and is living with his sister while he \\"convalesces.\\" His pregnant sister, Mrs. Foley, has two children: Jimmy, a cripple, and Lily, a prostitute. Her husband is away fighting in the British army. The first two acts are devoted to their squalid living conditions and the well-meaning but misguided attempts of a charity worker to alleviate their situation with platitudes. At the end of the second act, it is revealed that Tully has won his court case and come into a small fortune. He immediately abandons his rabble-rousing reformist stance and decides to buy property in the slums. The third act takes place in the Towsend Thanatorium Boardroom and opens with a comic discussion between two medical students, Medical Dick and Medical Davy, and a charwoman; during the course of their dialogue, it is revealed that Lily Foley has contracted syphilis. The Board is engaged in a plan to build a shamrock-shaped mortuary chapel for Protestants, Catholics, and Nonconformists, which is criticised as useless and frivolous by Dr. Tumulty, a cynical, practical-minded doctor. Tully, now a member of the Dublin Corporation, arrives to broker the sale of some tenement property as a site for the project. The meeting is disrupted by Tully's brother-in-law, Foley, who has returned from the war to find that he has been evicted from his tenement and that his wife, son, and newborn child have all perished in his absence. The Board responds with meaningless words of sympathy but apparently does not feel any culpability, and Dr. Tumulty is left to state the moral of the play: \\"All your benevolent formulism only makes the position more and more hopeless. The less you spend on prevention the more you will pay for cure. Until the citizens of this city realize that their children should be brought up in the most beautiful and favorable surroundings the city can afford, and not in the most squalid, until this floundering Moloch of a Government realize that they must spend more money on education than on police, this city will continue to be the breeding-ground of disease, vice, hypocrisy and discontent. I leave you to erect your tripartite edifice over the children of the city of blight.\\" Gogarty critics have noted that the over- prominence of Tumulty (who is essentially a mouthpiece for Gogarty and not a character in his own right) in Act III constitutes a \\"structural flaw\\". However, while acknowledging that the polemic play \\"suffers from the limitations of its kind\\", Gogarty's skilful use of comic dialogue and irony have been praised.Carens, p. 42 Reception and influence The play was highly anticipated by the theatregoing public and played to packed houses, with the Irish Independent commenting that \\"such an audience has not been at the Abbey since the night Shaw's Blanco Posnet was first produced [in 1909].\\" Critics commented on the play's grim efficacy in unveiling the horrors of slumdom, and Sir John Russell, speaking at a charitable dinner a week after the Blight's appearance, said that it exposed the plight of Dublin's poor as no play ever had.O'Connor, p. 154 Andrew Malone, writing a review of Irish drama in 1929, called it \\"undoubtedly the best play yet produced by an Irish dramatist dealing with a specifically Irish social problem\\" and observed that it \\"is marked by a critically ironic insight into social conditions.\\" Blight drew in a record ¬£160 in profits for the Abbey, but was cancelled by Lady Gregory after ten days, possibly due to the controversiality of some of its content. Se√°n O'Casey was present at Blight's opening night, later stating that it was one of only two plays that he had ever gone to see at the Abbey.O'Connor, p. 155 It has been suggested that Blight may have had an influence on O'Casey's later drama, particularly Juno and the Paycock,Carens, p. 45 but O'Casey himself claimed that it \\"had no influence whatever on me.\\" Sources Category:Irish plays ","title":"Blight (play)"},{"id":"24681839","text":"Leslie Gordon \\"Les\\" Young (born August 19, 1931) was a politician from Alberta, Canada.

The breakthrough mainstream success that the band received with their follow-up album From Under the Cork Tree (2005) strengthened the song's popularity and helped it reach No. 84 on the now- defunct US Billboard Pop 100 chart.Allmusic Fall Out Boy Charts and Awards: Billboard Singles Allmusic.com. Retrieved August 2, 2011. It has also drawn in a large amount of digital downloads. The single was released on yellow vinyl, a split 7\\" with My Awesome Compilation. An acoustic version of the song was released on the 2004 EP My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue, and a new dance remix (Millennium version) of the song was included in the 2005 re- release of Take This to Your Grave: Director's Cut. The lyrics deal with jealousy and unrequited love. Both Patrick Stump and Pete Wentz disliked \\"Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy\\" during the recording process; Stump particularly disliked the a cappella opening, which was producer Sean O'Keefe's idea. The title of the song was taken, without permission, from a Braid song, and subsequently, the name of the record label started by Braid members, Roy Ewing and Todd Bell. \\"Grand Theft Autumn\\" was referenced, among many other Fall Out Boy songs, on their 2008 album Folie √† Deux track \\"What a Catch, Donnie\\", featuring Gabe Saporta of Cobra Starship singing the chorus of the song. The song remains a Fall Out Boy concert staple to date 2015. Music video The video, directed by (Dale \\"Rage\\" Resteghini) begins with a close-up of vocalist/guitarist Patrick Stump as he begins to sing, then cuts to show the rest of the band performing outdoors in the snow. Throughout the rest of the video, shots of the band are interlaced with the storyline of the video. The storyline depicts a boy with a hand-held camera walking in the woods. He reaches a house and hangs around for a small period of time. A girl wakes up and notices him. She begins to get dressed. He then records her while she puts on her clothes. She looks out the window at the boy, causing him to get scared and run away. He reaches his van and opens the door, only to find the girl is inside, and they begin to make out. The last the girl is seen is when she smiles at the boy. The video ends with a close-up of Patrick Stump. The video was shot in a cabin on the Muskegon River owned by Myron of the Dirty Americans. The stalker boy in the video is played by Jeremiah Pilbeam, also of the Dirty Americans. The girl is played by actress/dancer Leila Mahadin. The boy and the girl from the video also appear in the band's 2006 \\"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\\" music video, at bassist Pete Wentz's \\"funeral\\".

Biography  Cameron, who had migrated from Scotland to Kentucky, had come to Texas in 1836, arriving just after the Texas Revolution. In late December 1842, the Mier Expedition was a raid on the Mexican border settlement of Ciudad Mier, which turned into the Battle of Mier when the Mexican Army arrived. Cameron and the other Texans were taken prisoner, after inflicting a large number of casualties on the other side. At a location called El Rancho Salado, a jar containing 159 white beans and 17 black beans was presented to the Texan prisoners. Each man drew a bean from the jar, while blindfolded. The 17 Texan prisoners who drew black beans were executed at dusk by a Mexican firing squad. This is known as the Black Bean Episode and occurred on March 25, 1843, three months after the Battle of Mier. Cameron had selected a white bean, which should have saved his life. Yet he had earned the hostility of Mexican Colonel Antonio Canales Rosillo for his role in his embarrassing defeat in the battle at Fort Lipantitl√°n, Texas, in July 1842, and for Cameron's role in leading an escape attempt. Colonel Canales urged the Mexican dictator Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna to have Cameron executed. On April 25, 1843, the prisoners who had drawn white beans were being moved to Mexico City. As they traveled, a courier arrived with orders from Santa Anna for Cameron's execution. Cameron was shot by a firing squad at Perote Prison in the state of Veracruz, the next morning, April 26, 1843. Cameron refused to confess to a priest, and declined the offer of a blindfold, declaring, \\"For the liberty of Texas, Ewen Cameron can look death in the face.\\" He then opened his hunting shirt and yelled at his executioners, \\"Fuego!\\" (Fire!). Cameron was presumably buried at Perote, Veracruz. Therefore, his remains were not among those exhumed a few years later and returned to Texas. Cameron County, Texas, and Cameron, Texas, are named for Ewen Cameron.

Wexler resigned on January 3, 2010, to become the President of the S. Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East Peace. Florida's 19th congressional district was a liberal-leaning district based in South Florida, stretching from Greenacres to Margate in Broward County and Palm Beach County. The election was initially scheduled to occur on April 6, the last day of Passover. However, national Jewish advocacy groups, citing the schedule conflict and the high density of Jewish voters in the district, called for the election to be moved to a later date. Ultimately, then-Governor Charlie Crist moved the election to April 13, 2010. State Senator Ted Deutch, the Democratic nominee, easily defeated Edward Lynch, the Republican nominee, and was elected to a full term later in 2010. Democratic primary Candidates *Ted Deutch, State Senator *Ben Graber, former Broward County Commissioner Campaign During the campaign, Graber, who had unsuccessfully run for this seat in 1996 and 2008, emphasized his progressive policies, favoring \\"universal health care and opposition to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\\" Deutch, meanwhile, focused on his \\"ability to get things done\\" in the Republican-dominated state legislature and his concern about the national security threat posed by Iran. Former Congressman Wexler, along with then-Congressmen Alcee Hastings, Ron Klein, and Debbie Wasserman Schultz, endorsed Deutch, who ended up winning the primary by a wide margin. Results Republican primary Candidates *Edward Lynch, businessman *Joe Budd, financial planner *Curt Price, retired police officer Campaign During the campaign, Lynch and Budd each emphasized their commitment to the Tea Party movement, and attacked each other over their business practices and debts. Lynch was attacked for owing the federal government $1.4 million in back income taxes, previously registering to vote as a Democrat, and for owing money to subcontractors. Budd, meanwhile, was attacked for a $25,000 tax lien. By the end of the campaign, Price and Budd announced that they would not support Lynch in the general election if he won the primary. Ultimately, Lynch narrowly won the primary by just 48 votes, narrowly beating out Budd. Results General election Campaign The general election campaign featured sharp distinctions between Deutch and Lynch. Lynch attacked the recently-passed Affordable Care Act as a \\"government takeover\\" of healthcare, while Deutch said that he would have voted for the bill. McCormick, meanwhile, running as an independent candidate, argued that his lack of affiliation with either of the major parties would allow him to bring change. In the end, owing to the Democratic nature of the district, as well as Deutch's history of representing the area in the legislature, Deutch beat Lynch by a wide margin.

On 7 June 1865 a permanent way (groundwork and rails) gang were lifting and packing the \\"up\\" line north of Rednal station on a 1 in 132 gradient that falls from Whittington. A green flag had been set away at the top of the incline as a warning. At 12:29 an excursion train from Birkenhead left Chester for Shrewsbury consisting of 28 coaches and two brake vans and hauled by two locomotives. An additional four coaches were added at Gobowen. When the train reached Whittington it began to gain speed on the gradient, but the driver of the front locomotive did not see the flag warning of the work ahead. The brakes were applied when the workmen were sighted, but it was too late to stop such a heavy train. The lead locomotive derailed on the unsupported track, but continued along the ballast until it reached points outside Rednal station where it ran off the rails and turned over. The extreme weight of the following train meant that the first four carriages were destroyed completely, killing 11 passengers and 2 train crew. The enquiry, while criticizing the lack of braking power on such a massive train, blamed mainly the inadequate protection of the permanent way work, which should be supplemented by detonators.

Owned by Marquee Broadcasting, it is sister to Perry-licensed MeTV affiliate WPGA-TV (channel 58). The two stations share studios on Forsyth Street in downtown Macon and transmitter facilities on GA 87/US 23/US 129 Alternate (Golden Isles Highway), along the Twiggs‚ÄìBibb county line. History The station first signed on the air on July 14, 2004, as W50DA; it originally operated as an owned-and- operated translator station of the Trinity Broadcasting Network. In 2009, Register Communications (owner of then-ABC affiliate WPGA-TV) purchased the station from TBN for $6,000.Deals, Broadcasting & Cable, August 1, 2009. In early September 2009, W50DA dropped TBN programming and announced that it would change its network affiliation to the Retro Television Network on October 12. The day after the switch, the station's callsign was changed to WPGA-LP. WPGA-LP has a construction permit that was first issued to the station by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2006 to flash-cut its digital signal into operation, which would significantly increase its signal coverage; this permit expired in March 2009. In mid-August 2011, WPGA- LP changed its primary affiliation to This TV, which was previously carried on the second digital subchannel of WPGA-TV (which is now affiliated with MeTV). In addition to This TV programming, WPGA-LP for a time once used to simulcast the WPGA-FM radio program Mix in the Morning, which also airs on WPGA-TV, sister radio station WPGA (980 AM) and WNEX (1400 AM), each weekday from 6:00 to 9:00 a.m. On July 2, 2015, This TV moved back to WPGA-TV on DT3; subsequently, WPGA-LP went dark for an undetermined amount of time.

He was born in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. and moved to Florida in the late 1970s to attend Flagler College in St. Augustine, where he met and married his wife, Kathy. Moving to South Florida, he launched his radio career at WKGR 98.7 (Ft. Pierce, Florida) where he stayed until the station was sold. He then followed the entire on-air staff to then WAKS-FM 103.7 (Fort Myers, Florida) where they stayed until it too was eventually sold. Once again, the entire on-air staff returned to the east coast of Florida to take over WZZR 92.7 (Port St. Lucie, Florida) where he continued his program \\"The Dead Zone\\" until the end of 1994 when he took over the morning drive show. He remained there until the spring of 1996 when he was fired for sagging ratings. Greg then, moved to Daytona Beach and started his own advertising agency (Alternative Advertising). After four years in the advertising business, he was offered, and accepted, the Production Director post at WELE 1380, Ormond Beach. After a year, as Production Director he was promoted to the Program Director position.

It is an orally bioavailable, small molecule agent which is thought to inhibit angiogenesis in cancer cells; specifically apatinib inhibits VEGF-mediated endothelial cell migration and proliferation thus blocking new blood vessel formation in tumor tissue. This agent also mildly inhibits c-Kit and c-SRC tyrosine kinases.http://www.cancer.gov/Templates/drugdictionary.aspx?CdrID=592508 Apatinib was first synthesized by Advenchen Laboratories in California, USA and is being developed by Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine (China), LSK BioPartners (US) and Bukwang Pharmaceutical Company (Korea). It is an investigational cancer drug currently undergoing clinical trials as a potential targeted treatment for metastatic gastric carcinoma, metastatic breast cancer and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Phase I/II clinical study The principal investigator from Fudan University, China, presented results of Phase I/II human clinical studies at the 2009 CSCO Meeting (October 17, 2009). Cancer patients were administered varied doses of Apatinib daily for 28 days. Apatinib was well tolerated at doses below 750 mg/day, 3 of 3 dose limiting toxicities were reported at 1000 mg/day and the maximum tolerated dose is determined to be 850 mg/day. The investigator also reported of 65 cancer patients treated in Phase I/II, 1.54% had a complete response, 12.31% had a partial response, 66.15% had stable disease and 20% had progressive disease. A separate published report on the safety and pharmacokinetics of apatinib in Human clinical studies concludes that it has encouraging antitumor activity across a broad range of cancer types. Current status There is a Phase II/III study recruiting patients in China to determine whether apatinib can improve progression free survival compared with placebo in patients with metastatic gastric carcinoma who have failed two lines of chemotherapy (September, 2009).http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00970138?term=NCT00970138&rank;=1 Apatinib was approved by CFDA in December, 2014 for patients with late-stage gastric carcinoma in China. A phase IV study on safety of Apatinib started in April, 2015. The study aims to recruit 2,000 patients. As of November, 2010, two additional Phase II clinical studies have been initiated for apatinib in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=apatinib On March 7, 2011, Bukwang announced that it filed an IND to the Korean FDA to begin Human clinical studies of Apatinib in Phase II.http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?year=2011&no;=144122 Non-clinical studies Some cancer cells have the ability to develop resistance to the cytotoxic effects of certain cancer drugs (called multidrug resistance). A study concluded that apatinib may be useful in circumventing cancer cells' multidrug resistance to certain conventional antineoplastic drugs. The study showed that apatinib reverses the ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated multidrug resistance by inhibiting those functions and increasing the intracellular concentrations of the antineoplastic drugs. This study suggests that apatinib will be potentially effective in combination therapies with conventional anticancer drugs especially in cases where resistance to chemotherapy exists.

It is produced by cells (odontoblasts) inside the teeth (dental pulp), and in smaller quantities by bone tissues (osteoblasts and osteocytes). It is required for normal hardening (mineralisation) of teeth. During teeth development, it is broken down into three proteins such as dentin sialoprotein (DSP), dentin glycoprotein (DGP), and dentin phosphoprotein (DPP). These proteins become the major non-collagenous components of teeth. Their distribution in the collagen matrix of the forming dentin suggests these proteins play an important role in the regulation of mineral deposition. Additional evidence for this correlation is phenotypically manifested in patients with mutant forms of dentin sialophosphoprotein. Such patients suffer dental anomalies including type III dentinogenesis imperfecta.Letty Moss- Salentijn, Biology of Mineralized Tissue coursenotes, Columbia University College of Dental Medicine, 2009Nanci, Antonio. Ten Cate's Oral Histology: Development, Structure, and Function. 7th ed. St. Louis, MO: Mosby Elsevier, 2008. Print. It is coded by a gene of the same name (dentin sialophosphoprotein, or DSPP) present on human chromosome 4. This gene encodes two principal proteins of the dentin extracellular matrix of the tooth. The preproprotein is secreted by odontoblasts and cleaved into dentin sialoprotein and dentin phosphoprotein. Dentin phosphoprotein is thought to be involved in the biomineralization process of dentin. Mutations in this gene have been associated with dentinogenesis imperfecta-1; in some individuals, dentinogenesis imperfecta occurs in combination with an autosomal dominant form of deafness. Allelic differences due to repeat polymorphisms have been found for this gene.

Biography Early life and education Brinig was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota to Romanian parents, but grew up in Butte, Montana. Brinig began studying at New York University in 1914, where poet Joyce Kilmer gave him lectures on writing. He then studied at Columbia University and started his career by writing short stories for magazines. Brinig's first novel, Madonna Without Child, was released in 1929. Published by Doubleday, the novel tells the story of a woman who is obsessed with another woman's baby. Career Many of Brinig's early novels depicted the settlement and development of Montana, the state he grew up in. These novels include Singermann (1929), Wide Open Town (1931), This Man Is My Brother (1932), and The Sun Sets in the West (1935). Brinig based the main character of these novels, Singermann, on his father, Moses Brinig, who was a Romanian immigrant and shopkeeper. Brinig's novels often depicted miners, labor organizers, farmers, and businessmen living in Montana. These usually became bestsellers in the United States and were praised by critics of The New York Times. One of the best-selling novels, The Sisters, was adapted to a feature-length film in 1938, starring Bette Davis and Errol Flynn. Brinig's novels often dealt with homosexuality. It was a common theme for Brinig because he was a homosexual himself (although he was publicly closeted all his life). According to the Gay & Lesbian Literary Heritage, Brinig was the \\"first American Jewish novelist to write in any significant way about the gay experience.\\" In 1951, The New York Times Book Review said Brinig's \\"sentimental streak and his sympathetic touch with characters usually lend his books a warm glow of humanity, if not of art.\\" At the beginning of his career, Brinig was praised by critics for his \\"artistry and inventivenss in narrative, character and incident.\\" In the early 1930s, he was described as one of the leading young writers in America. Brinig's last novels, however, were met with mixed reviews from critics, who criticized them for their \\"verbosity and banality.\\" Brinig died on May 13, 1991. The cause of his death was gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

Biography Nikola Atanasov was born to a poor family in the village of Fotovishta, today known as Ognyanovo in Garmen Municipality, then part of the Ottoman Empire. He won a scholarship and finished the Bulgarian Theological School in Constantinople. He returned in Macedonia and entered the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) by joining the revolutionary bands of Stoyan Filipov and Stoyan Malchankov. After the liberation of Pirin Macedonia in the Balkan Wars in 1912, Atanasov worked in the tax administration of Nevrokop, today known as Gotse Delchev. At the same time, he continued to participate in the activities of the revolutionary organization. In April 1926, Atanasov was elected mayor of Nevrokop and remained in this position until May 1932. As mayor, he planned the public organization of the town ‚Äì he created the first urbanization plan, he constructed a water-conduit and an electricity grid, he built a new secondary school. In his memoirs, Ivan Mihaylov wrote the following about Atanasov: After the Bulgarian coup d'√©tat of 1934, and the strike against the IMARO, Atanasov was interned in Lovech.

Origin of the Arizona Rangers  After the establishment of the Confederate Arizona Territory, Governor John Robert Baylor decided he needed to supplement existing militia companies with a regiment of Rangers like the Texas Rangers. He intended this regiment would consist of several companies of cavalry. On January 25, 1862, its first company, Company A, Baylor's Regiment of Arizona Rangers commanded by Captain Sherod Hunter, was mustered into the Confederate service at the town of Dona Ana located just north of modern Las Cruces, New Mexico.Martin Hardwick Hall, THE CONFEDERATE ARMY OF NEW MEXICO, Austin, Texas: Presidial Press, 1978, pp 353-355 and 367-369. Hunter's Company consisted of about 75 men for the most part residents of the Confederate Territory of Arizona. They were armed with revolvers and Model 1847 smoothbore musketoons, probably taken from Fort Fillmore after it surrendered in August 1861. The company was enlisted for three years, or the duration of the war. They were picked for their skills and experience with the hardships of frontier life. Many were former members of the three local Arizona Militia companies from Pinos Altos and Messila.L. Boyd Finch, CONFEDERATE PATHWAY TO THE PACIFIC: MAJOR SHEROD HUNTER AND ARIZONA TERRITORY, C.S.A., Tucson, Arizona: Arizona Historical Society, 1996, p. 171.  Arizona Campaign against the California Column  Confederate Arizona and New Mexico Territories On February 10, 1862 Company A was ordered to occupy Tucson, the largest town in the western Confederate Territory of Arizona. Tucson was located on the Butterfield Overland Mail road, the only one between California and the Rio Grande and Mesilla valleys, and an ideal location for an advanced post to observe and delay the advance of Union forces gathering under Col. James Henry Carleton at Fort Yuma. By taking possession of Tucson, Baylor would also protect the citizens and secure the Confederate claim to possession of western Arizona, which had been abandoned by Union troops in 1861. Company A arrived in Tucson on February 28, with the loss of only one life; Corporal Benjamin Mayo who had died of exposure at San Simon Stage Station on the 25th. The invasion of Arizona by the California Column would have come much sooner but for the tactics of Captain Hunter and Company A. At White's Mill, near the Pima Villages, about twenty miles south of present Phoenix, Captain Hunter captured without firing a shot, a scouting party of nine men of Company A, 1st Regiment California Volunteer Cavalry under Captain William McCleave. Following their surprise of McCleave they destroyed caches of hay stored at the Butterfield stage stations along the barren route from Fort Yuma to the Gila River. At the villages of the Pima Indians on the Gila River, (about 30 miles south of present-day Phoenix, Arizona), Hunter also discovered 1,500 sacks of flour from wheat purchased from the Pima by federal purchase agent Ammi M. White. It had been ground into flour and stored in his mill in anticipation of the advance of the Union forces. Hunter's men arrested White, disabled the mill and confiscated the flour. However, because of insufficient transport Hunter could not remove the flour, so Sherod gave it back to the Pima for them to use. When news of the capture of McCleave got back to Fort Yuma, a larger force under Captain William Calloway was sent along the same route with orders to find and free Captain McCleave and his men. Calloway's force clashed with Elements of Company A burning hay at Stanwix Station and after a brief skirmish, the Arizona Rangers retreated to Tucson. Afterward Calloway reached the Pima Villages, the main supply point between Fort Yuma and Tucson and after a short rest, set out toward Tucson. As they approached Picacho Pass, Indian scouts brought in information that Confederate pickets were just ahead. Lieutenant James Barrett and a small group of his Company A, First Cavalry were ordered to make a wide detour to strike them on the flank, while Calloway would make a frontal attack with the main party. In the following Battle of Picacho Pass the Barret's California cavalry engaged alone and suffered defeat in a brisk engagement. The Confederates watched the California cavalry retreat, then they fell back to Tucson, to warn Tucson's garrison of the approaching Union army. Captain Calloway returned to the Pima Villages and started work on a permanent camp, throwing up earth works around the flour mill of Ammi White, who had been taken away with McCleve to Mesilla by the rebels a few weeks before. This earth work was named \\"Fort Barrett\\" in honor of their comrade killed at Picacho Pass. Confiscation of the wheat and burning of hay now forced a halt at the villages while new supplies were gathered. It required several weeks for the main elements of the \\"Column\\" to get to Pima Villages, due to the time needed to gather more hay along the route. Further delay occurred because only detachments of less than four companies could move over the desert routes within twenty-four hours of each other, due to the scarcity of water. The net effect of the Arizona Rangers' actions was to delay the advance of the California Column for over a month, which probably saved the Confederate Army of New Mexico, now retreating back to Mesilla from its defeat at the Battle of Glorietta Pass, from being intercepted and destroyed by the California Column during April 1862. After the battle at Picacho Pass, Captain Hunter wrote to Governor Baylor, requesting a reinforcement of at least 250 men, with which he felt he could hold Tucson. When no reinforcements were forthcoming, Hunter decided to evacuate Tucson. Company A left Tucson on May 14, leaving behind a small detachment under the command of Lieutenant James Henry Tevis to watch for the approach of Union forces. Unknown to the Confederates, on that same day, the Union California Column finally left its bivouac at the Pima Villages for its final advance on Tucson. On May 15, Colonel West and his advance California detachment moved out of the Pima Villages for Tucson, going through Rattlesnake Springs to old Fort Breckenridge, and camped that night in the \\"Canyon de Oro\\". The next day, May 19, a short march of fifteen miles was made, and the party camped within ten miles of Tucson. Early on the morning of the 20th, the command moved forward until it arrived within two miles of the town. Captain Emil Fritz, Company B, 1st Cavalry, was ordered take his first platoon to make a detour and come in on the east side of the town; the second platoon, under Juan Francisco Guirado, was to charge in on the north side, while the four companies of infantry were to come in on the road from the west. Lieutenant Tevis and his detachment were surprised and almost captured when the Yankee cavalry charged into town on May 20. The three California columns arrived at the plaza at the same moment, the cavalry at the charge and the infantry at the double quick, but found no enemy. Tevis and his men had managed to escape, and rejoined the main body of Company A a few days later. During the retreat to Messilla, Company A clashed twice with the Apache. First, in the Battle of Dragoon Springs, where four of its soldiers were killed and some of its stock were lost. In the Second Battle of Dragoon Springs they had the best of the encounter.  With the Army of New Mexico and the Sibley Brigade  After Hunter's Company A retreated from Tucson and arrived in Mesilla on May 27, 1862, it was organized with two Arizona militia companies, the Arizona Guards of Pinos Altos and the Arizona Rangers of Mesilla, under Herbert's Battalion of Arizona Cavalry under the command of Lt. Colonel Philemon T. Herbert. It served as rearguard to the remnants of the Army of New Mexico as it withdrew from El Paso to San Antonio, in July 1862. After their arrival in San Antonio, Herbert‚Äôs Battalion was formally assigned to the \\"Sibley Brigade\\", the name given the former Army of New Mexico. Colonel Thomas Green was in command in place of Brigadier General Henry Hopkins Sibley, who was away in Richmond until December, 1862. On October 2, 1862, Sherod Hunter was promoted Major and joined Second Cavalry Regiment, Arizona Brigade under Colonel George Wythe Baylor. First Lieutenant Robert L. Swope, was promoted to Captain and assumed command of the Company A. On December 2, 1862, General Sibley was ordered to New Iberia, Louisiana, to take over command of his Brigade. On December 25 he found that most of the Brigade had been ordered to Galveston but Herbert‚Äôs Battalion was there in Louisiana actively scouting in the vicinity of Plaquemine and the Mississippi River. In February 1863, shortly after the arrival of the Sibley Brigade in Louisiana, Captain Robert L. Swope resigned as commander of Company A. First Lieutenant James Henry Tevis took command, but was not promoted to the rank of Captain at the time. In April 1863, the Sibley Brigade including Herbert‚Äôs Arizona Battalion was among the men with which General Taylor confronted the Yankee army under General Nathaniel Banks at Fort Bisland, on the Bayou Teche. The Battle of Fort Bisland was a defeat for the Confederates, and General Taylor ordered a retreat. General Sibley, in command of the rear guard, nearly lost his command at Franklin, Louisiana, when he ordered the last bridge across the Bayou burned before his men had made their escape. Fortunately they saw the flames behind them and quickly disengaged and fled across the bridge before it was fully engulfed in flames. Sibley was court-martialed for this and removed from command of the Brigade. Colonel Thomas Green, who had led the brigade, was promoted to Brigadier General and placed in command of the Brigade.  Arizona Scout Company in Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas  By the end of May 1863 the Arizona Battalion had been reduced by losses and it was broken up. Company A still had enough men to continue as a viable company, and was kept in being but renamed as the independent Arizona Scout Company, attached to Green's Brigade. The other two companies of the Battalion were disbanded and the men consolidated with those of Company A to form the Arizona Scout Company. In June 1863 the Scouts participated in the Bayou Teche Campaign. The surrender of the Confederate bastion at Port Hudson, Louisiana in July 1863 led to the retreat of Green's Brigade to the region of Shreveport, Louisiana. In November 1863, the Arizona Scouts fought with Green's Brigade against a Union invasion up the Bayou Teche. In early December 1863 the brigade was recalled to Texas, in response to a threatened assault on Galveston which never materialized. In late December 1863, while near Galveston, the Second and Third Texas-Arizona Cavalry Regiments were reassigned to the Texas Cavalry Brigade commanded by Brigadier General James Patrick Major and the Scouts were assigned to that brigade also, However, in February 1864, the Arizona Scouts were among the companies detached from Texas Cavalry Brigade to form a Scouting Battalion under the command of Major William Saufley. Captain Tevis‚Äôs Arizona Scout Company became Company E of the Battalion. During January and February 1864 the company operated as part of a command under Colonel James Duff 33rd Texas Cavalry near Indianola, Texas. During the Red River Campaign, the Arizona Scouts again fought as part of Major's Texas Cavalry Brigade which was combined with Green's Brigade, and a brigade of Louisiana regiments to form a Cavalry Division under Major General Tom Green. The Arizona Scouts fought in the major battles at Wilson's Farm (April 7, 1864), Mansfield and Pleasant Hill, and in numerous other skirmishes throughout the campaign. On May 1, 1864 the Arizona Scouts under Lt. John M. Smith assisted in the capture Union transport, the U.S.S. Emma near Wilson‚Äôs Landing on the Red River. Captain Tevis wounded earlier in the campaign, served under the command of First Lieutenant John M. Smith for the rest of the campaign. After the Red River Campaign, the Texas Cavalry Division, under Major General John A. Wharton, was among the units ordered northward into Arkansas. Arizona Scouts, went with them and for the rest of 1864 fought minor skirmishes and conducted routine picket duty and scouting. In November 1864, Captain Tevis (who by that time had recovered from his wounds) returned to command of the Arizona Scouts until General Edmund Kirby Smith, surrendered all Confederate forces west of the Mississippi River on May 26, 1865.

It was later expanded to a four battalion regiment with a depot and won distinction in the Walcheren Expedition, the Peninsular War, and the German Campaign of 1813. It was disbanded in 1815. Establishment The first officers included members of the Society of United Irishmen who had fled to France in 1797. It also included Irishmen who had been taken during the 1798 rebellion who were freed during the short peace effected by the Treaty of Amiens on condition of exile, and who had sailed for France in June 1802. The treaty broke down in May 1803 with the start of the War of the Third Coalition. As a part of Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom in 1803‚Äì05, the Irish Legion was to provide the indigenous core for a much larger invasion force of 20,000 earmarked to take Ireland, known as the Corps d'Irlande. The Legion was established on August 31, 1803 in Morlaix, France. Bernard MacSheehy was assigned to form the regiment. He was an Adjutant-General in Napoleon's army. The purpose of the Legion was to align the Irish hearts to the French cause in the imminent invasion of Ireland. General Pierre Augereau had been ordained to lead the invasion, and wanted Irishmen to serve in his army. However, the Battle of Cape Finisterre and the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 made a safe sea crossing uncertain at best, and Napoleon was forced to abandon his plans for Ireland. He shifted his focus towards Austria and Eastern Europe and launched the Austerlitz campaign in late 1805. The legion remained on the French coast on garrison duty and coastal defence. Formation and colours The Legion was eventually expanded from a battalion to a regiment and there was greater demand for more soldiers. These made a varied group; some were former United Irishmen who were taken prisoner in 1798-99 and then freed during the peace that followed the Treaty of Amiens (1802‚Äì03), some had been pressed into the Royal Navy and escaped, and some were German or Polish. While the Legion was stationed at the Fortress of Mainz in 1806, they were joined by 1,500 Poles. Its headquarters was at 's-Hertogenbosch, known to the French as Bois-le-Duc, in what was then the Kingdom of Holland. The Irish Legion had its own flag,Of \\"Irish Green\\", as it was described, of silk, fringed with gold cord, inscribed on one side in letters on gold: \\"Napol√©on, Empereur des Fran√ßais, √† la Legion Irlandaise,\\" and bearing on the other a golden harp, uncrowned, and the words \\"L‚ÄôInd√©pendance d‚ÄôIrlande.\\" and in December 1805 received an eagle. The Legion was the only group of foreign soldiers in the French military to whom Napoleon ever gave an eagle. Wearing a green uniform,http://legionirlandaise.forumactif.ca/forum L√©gion Irlandaise its maximum size was about 2,000 men. Foreign regiments in the French Army 1810.

The regiment was greatly assisted from 1807 by Napoleon's war minister Marshal of France Henri Clarke, who was born in France to Irish parents and whose family had close links to the ancien regime Irish brigade that had served the kings of France. He and his father had served in Dillon's Regiment, and his mother's father and several uncles served in Clare's Regiment. In August 1811 the Legion was renamed the 3e Regiment Etranger (Irlandais) (3rd Foreign Regiment (Irish)), but throughout the unit's history it was always referred to as the Irish Regiment. Actions Soldier's regalia seen in an Irish museum, circa 1910. In 1808 the Second Battalion fought in the Peninsular War, helping to subdue Madrid during the Dos de Mayo Uprising. In the middle of January 1810 the 3rd Battalion was posted to Spain. In June 1810 an Army of Portugal was formed under Mass√©na which was composed of three Army Corps. The two battalions of the Irish Legion became part of General Junot‚Äôs 8th Corps. Before joining with the Massena's main army, Junot was detailed to secure the flank of the Army of Portugal's intended advance by capturing the city of Astorga in the Province of Le√≥n. They led the assault that took the city. During the battle, Captain John Allen's company's drummer boy continued to beat the charge after having lost both legs, for which he was given the French Legion of Honor. The Irish Battalions remained on active service with the Army of Portugal through the sieges of Ciudad Rodrigo and Almeida, the Battle of Bussaco and the full course of the advance to the Lines of Torres Vedras. In September 1810 occurred the Battle of Bussaco, where elite companies of the Irish Legion engaged an Irish regiment in the British army, the 88th Foot (Connaught Rangers). William Grattan's 'Adventure of the Connaught Rangers' details an engagement between the two units among the rocks above Bussaco. The Connaughts led an epic bayonet charge against the French troops there and after the action, Grattan explains, he came across the French 4th regiment and the 'Irish Brigade' (meaning of course the Irish Regiment) on the rocks there, mentioning that several of the latter were wounded but there were no Irishmen among them (denoting that the wounded men from the Irish Regiment were all foreigners). Napoleon had decreed on 28 October 1810 that the Irish Regiment should be reduced to two battalions, whereby the 2nd & 3rd Battalions would become the 2nd Battalion. The reformed 2nd Battalion saw hard service as part of the rearguard on the retreat from Lisbon. By the time it arrived back in Spain, the unit had nineteen officers and 254 men present with the colours, and another 128 men absent from sickness or other reasons. Solignac's Division took the field once more in the spring of 1811 for the relief of Almeida; at this time the battalion strength was 390 officers and men. Between 3 & 5 May, heavy fighting took place at Fuentes de O√±oro and on the slopes in the vicinity. On the first day, Solignac's Division was held in reserve behind the centre-right of Massena's line and the Irish remained idle all day. On the 5th they were the general reserve to the flanking attack made on the British right wing and again were not engaged. In early December 1811, the orders arrived in Spain for the return to France of the officers and non-commissioned officers of the Irish Battalion. The non-Irish privates were to be incorporated into the Prussian Regiment serving with the Army of Portugal. It was not until 11 April 1812 that they arrived at the regimental depot at Bois-le-Duc ( s‚ÄôHertogenbosch ) in The Netherlands. The First Battalion saw its first action at the Battle of Flushing in the Walcheren Campaign of 1809, suffering many casualties from malaria. Early in 1813 the Irish Regiment was ordered to merge the three existing battalions into two full-strength war battalions. Command of the 1st Battalion went to Chef de Bataillon John TennentOn his commission papers his name was spelt as ‚ÄòTenant‚Äô. In France, unaccustomed with the name, they used about all the different possibilities of the spelling : Tennant, Tennent, Tenent, Tenant and that of the 2nd Battalion to Chef de Bataillon Hugh Ware. On 1 February they broke camp and made a long winter march to Magdeberg. The Irish Regiment made forced marches to arrive on the battlefield of Bautzen during the morning of 21 May, the second day of the battle. At the head of Puthod‚Äôs Division they attacked Barclay‚Äôs Corps on the extreme allied right. On 26 May they fought with distinction at the Battle of Hanau under the direct command of the emperor. The Irish were rewarded by being given the honour of posting guard at the town of Lignitz (Legnica) for Napoleon until the Imperial Guard arrived and relieved them. On 16 August, at the end of the brief armistice, Puthod's Division, including Vacherau's Brigade (The Irish Regiment, 134th & 143rd Regiments), were assembled at Goldberg in Silesia. On the eighteenth Blucher‚Äôs cavalry made contact with Puthod. The regiment formed squares to repel a cavalry attack: the squares held fast, and after a number of attempts to break them, the enemy backed off and brought forward artillery. They were then easy targets for cannon fire, losing 400 men before retiring in good order.The Irish Regiment lost three hundred men killed or wounded. Two officers were killed and ten wounded. Following Macdonald‚Äôs retreat after the Battle of the Katzbach with Blucher, General Pothod's Division became isolated from the rest of the army. The River Bober (B√≥br) had risen out of its banks from the heavy rains and the bridges were under water. The division had been reduced to six thousand men and twelve pieces of artillery. On the morning of 29 August they reached the town of Lowenberg/Lw√≥wek ≈ölƒÖski. It took up the best position it could find, on the narrow ridge above Plakowice, with its back to the river. All the bridges had been washed away and there was no possibility of constructing a bridge with the river flooding its banks on both sides. A combined Russian and Prussian Army of overwhelming superiority faced the Division but could only attack at the one narrow south-eastern end of the ridge. The battle began at 8:00 am and lasted until after 4:00pm. When the Division had expended the last of its ammunition, the enemy attacked and overran its position. Most of the officers waded into the river and swam to the opposite shore. The riverbed itself was not terribly wide although the current was strong. They were able to wade about half the distance, swim a short way, and walk through the water to dry land. James Perry swam over and back again to come to the aid of General Puthod, whose ADC he was, and both were taken prisoner.Lieutenant James Perry had been adjutant major to the 2nd Battalion at the siege of Astorga in 1810.The Irish were given the honour of leading the assault and he was wounded carrying a ladder to the breach; he was awarded the Legion of Honour. The total French casualties of killed, wounded, drowned and captured was more the 3,000. The Irish Regiment no longer existed as a fighting unit. Twenty-three officers out of 47 and 94 non-commissioned officers and soldiers returned from the campaign of 1813. Out of approximately 2,000 men who had marched to join the Grand Army eight months earlier, only 117 were left. The survivors managed to save their eagle and retired to Bois- le-Duc. In the ensuing Napoleonic retreat the regiment took part in the Siege of Antwerp 1814 and retired to Lille, where it remained until Napoleon's abdication in April 1814.http://www.theirishstory.com/2014/03/08/from limerick to antwerp Irish brigades abroad 1690-1815/ In 1805-15 eleven of the regiment's officers were awarded the Legion d'honneur, including the colonel, William Lawless, Chef de Bataillon John Tennent, and James Bartholomew Blackwell.http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/people/james_bartholomew_blackwell.htm Notes on Blackwell Disbandment The regiment divided in loyalty during the \\"Hundred Days\\", and was officially disbanded by King Louis XVIII on 28 September 1815. Its flags were burned and its eagle, like many, disappeared.

Established in 1962 as a sanctuary for migratory birds, Eastern Neck National Wildlife Refuge provides natural habitat for over 240 bird species ‚Äî including bald eagles and transitory peregrine falcons ‚Äî and is a major staging site for tundra swans. The refuge comprises the entirety of Eastern Neck Island, projecting into a bend of the Chester River. The island was one of the first settled places in Maryland, where Major Joseph Wickes was granted in 1650 and built the now-vanished \\"Wickliffe\\" mansion. History The lodge The island was visited in precolonial times by Woodland period Native Americans, who left shell middens, arrowheads and pottery behind. From 1658 to 1680, Joseph Wickes and his partner Thomas Hynson assembled the entire island under their ownership, farming the land. Captain Lambert Wickes, Joseph's great grandson and captain of the , is memorialized with a monument on the site of Wickliffe. The island was owned by the Wickes until 1902, who continued to raise a variety of crops on the land. After 1902 portions of the island became hunting preserves. In the 1920s, wealthy individuals from surrounding cities were attracted by the waterfowl concentrations and bought portions of the island for hunting retreats. The present visitor contact station was built as a hunting lodge in 1930. During the 1950s a property developer proposed to subdivide a portion of the island into 293 house lots. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service acquired the entire island between 1962 and 1967, preserving the land for wildlife. This purchase was largely in response to concerns over the development made by the local community.Kent County, Maryland Parks and Recreation The sole house built for the Cape Chester subdivision now houses park personnel. The Kent County Department of Parks and Recreation operates the Ingleside Recreation Area, under a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, from May 1 to September 30, with facilities for crabbing and car-top boat launching. Eastern Neck National Wildlife Refuge serves as a land-use model within the Chesapeake Bay watershed through its sustainable agriculture, wetland restoration and native landscaping. Eastern Neck National Wildlife Refuge is an increasingly popular nature tourism destination on Maryland's upper Eastern Shore, attracting over 70,000 visitors annually to its waterfront vistas, peaceful walking trails, and \\"watchable wildlife.\\" Alternative Energy Program The wind turbine installed at the Eastern Neck Island National Wildlife Management Area, Rock Hall, MD, in 2002 was the first turbine installed at a National WMA. In 2002, Eastern Neck Island became the first National Wildlife Refuge in the United States to install a wind turbine on its grounds.Reviewable Energy: Wind and Solar Power at Eastern Neck National Wildlife Refuge The project was made possible when the Maryland Energy Administration received $58,800 dollars from the U.S. Department of Energy as a result of the State Energy Program solicitation.Energy Facts and Program The project also include the construction of a solar renewable energy system at the refuge. The purpose of the 10 kW wind turbine is to provide on- site electric power to an administration building, while publicly demonstrating the concept of renewable energy. The project also exists to measure any avian interaction with the refuge's wind turbine. The DOE's Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) has allowed Eastern Neck NWR to contract the services of an expert in order to document the extent to which bird behavior is altered by the operation of the turbine. The turbine itself consists of three blades, which cover a circular area in diameter. The tower is . Considering the average wind speeds of the area, the system was designed to produce about 10,000 kW-hours per year. The two solar array panel groups generate peak levels of 150 and 167 watts, respectively. Activities Aside from birding and other wildlife viewing, Eastern Neck Island offers facilities and trails for hiking, boating, crabbing, fishing, hunting and biking. Eastern Neck Island Road begins at the Tundra Swan Boardwalk at the refuge's entrance and runs down the center of the island to the Wickliffe Historic Site, nearly to the southern tip. All trails and activities at the refuge are accessed from secondary roads off the main strip. Hiking Nearly six miles of roads and trails are open to visitors most of the year. Three wildlife trails and a handicap-accessible boardwalk and observation tower are available for those wishing to observe the varied habitats of the refuge. Trails include the Tidal Marsh Overlook trail, the Bayview/Butterfly trail, the Duck Inn and the Boxes Point trail, accessed directly off Eastern Neck Road. The latter is a popular site for bald eagle sightings. Wildlife The refuge bird list contains 243 species recorded on the refuge and includes wintering lesser scaup, long- tailed ducks, white-winged scoters, ruddy ducks, canvasbacks, buffleheads, redheads, and pintails. Numerous marsh and shore birds migrate through in spring and fall. Mallards, American black ducks, wood ducks, great blue herons, and green herons nest at the refuge. Birds of prey are also common and in some cases abundant at the refuge according to visitor guides. Bald eagles have fledged young each year since 1986, osprey establish nests in the spring and head south before the fall, and turkey vultures are abundant throughout the year.

Since then, donation and purchase has increased the size of the refuge to . The tidal marsh, coves and creeks, and vegetated ridges of the refuge form an important stopover and wintering area for thousands of migratory waterfowl and nesting habitat for various wildlife species. Martin National Wildlife Refuge is the largest unit of the Chesapeake Islands Refuges, which also includes Spring Island, Barren Island, and Bishops Head in Dorchester County, Maryland. The management of the Chesapeake Islands Refuges falls under the umbrella of the Chesapeake Marshlands National Wildlife Refuge Complex. Located in Cambridge, Maryland, the complex also manages Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge and Susquehanna River National Wildlife Refuge. Wildlife The tidal marsh, coves, creeks and ridges of the refuge provide an important rest area and winter home for thousands of migratory waterfowl and nesting habitat for a variety of wildlife that change with the seasons. Winter residents on the refuge include black ducks, pintail, mergansers, long-tailed ducks, scoters, bufflehead, Canada geese, and tundra swans. During spring and summer, the salt marsh grasses, abundant insects, and underwater vegetation attract black ducks, mallards, gadwall, and green-winged teal to nest on the refuge. Gulls, terns, black skimmers, oystercatchers, and willets nest and feed along the marsh grasses, mudflats, and sand bars. The wooded ridges provide nest sites for several water birds. Ten different species, including herons, egrets, and glossy ibis have been seen in rookeries on the refuge. Rookeries are groups or colonies of birds that nest together. Martin NWR supports the largest colony of brown pelicans in the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay. A small population of red fox, muskrat, mink, otter, voles, northern diamondback terrapin, and various nonvenomous water snakes also live in the marsh areas. Clapper rails, seaside sparrows, and marsh wrens also depend on the protected refuge habitat. Peregrine falcons have been nesting on the refuge every year since the first peregrine nesting tower was installed in 1984. The marsh and estuary are important in the production of marine species such as crabs and oysters that help form the food chain.

In the early 1940s, of water in the Upper Chesapeake Bay were closed by Presidential Proclamations to the hunting of migratory waterfowl. These water areas were designated as the Susquehanna National Wildlife Refuge. At the time of its establishment, the water areas known as the Susquehanna flats were covered with wild celery, pondweeds, redhead grass and other desirable waterfowl foods. Peak waterfowl population numbers included over 500,000 canvasback and redhead ducks and over 200,000 American wigeon. These rich areas of aquatic growth began declining in the 1960s due to changes in the water quality and quantity. Development above the Conowingo Dam caused more rapid drainage and greater water flow through the dam. Currents in the upper Chesapeake Bay deposited heavy loads of silt in the Susquehanna flats area. What remained of the suitable waterfowl vegetation was destroyed when Hurricane Agnes moved through in 1972. Today, only a few thousand geese may be found around the refuge during the winter months.

Biography  Campbell was born in Ireland in 1780. Little is known about Campbell's early years in Ireland, except that he was probably apprenticed as a tanner. He enlisted in the 71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot, one of the divisions that in July 1805 sailed for the Cape of Good Hope. In 1806 these troops invaded Buenos Aires under William Carr Beresford during the Anglo-Spanish War. After the British campaigns failed in their attempt and the regiment withdrew, Campbell was one of the soldiers who managed to remain in the River Plate. He joined the patriot ranks as a guerrilla leader, harassing Spanish forces both on land and on the Paran√° river. He was remarkable for his dexterity in gaucho-style duel, wielding a long knife in one hand and using a poncho wrapped around the other arm as a protective measure. He carried two riding pistols, a sabre, and a large knife in a leather sheath for his personal protection, and was assisted by a Tipperary-born gaucho known as 'Don Eduardo'. Campbell rose to prominence as a superb guerrilla fighter, serving under Jos√© Artigas, the caudillo of a region which encompassed the present-day Argentine provinces of Entre R√≠os and Corrientes, and much of Uruguay, a man regarded as one of Uruguay's founding fathers. Peter Campbell played a prominent role in the affairs of Corrientes province, and for a period after 1819 acted as its deputy governor. First against the Spaniards during the Argentine War of Independence and later against Buenos Aires in the civil wars that followed Argentine sovereignty. Campbell was responsible for establishing a regiment of mounted Tap√© indigenous people. They were feared both as a cavalry and infantry force because their tactics were so difficult to counteract. Armed with rifles with long bayonets attached to them, his indigenous force was trained to charge the enemy on horseback at great speed before dismounting and opening fire with their rifles. In 1814, Campbell began putting together a squadron of river vessels to support Artigas on the Paran√°. In 1818 Peter Campbell took charge of the second squadron of the Uruguayan naval forces, based in Goya and Esquina, Corrientes. He became naval commander-in-chief of the region and the scourge of the Paraguayan dictator Francia's river fleet. On 21 August 1818 Artigas appointed Campbell as the first naval commander of the patriot fleet. It is on the basis of this appointment that the Irishman is acknowledged as the founder of the Uruguayan navy. In September 1818 Peter Campbell managed to seize two vessels carrying arms for the Paraguayan army. Between January and March 1819, together with the land forces of governor L√≥pez, Campbell besieged the town of Capilla del Rosario. On 10 March 1819 the Uruguayan army won the Battle of Barrancas against the army of Buenos Aires. Advancing on the Argentine city, the combined federalist forces defeated the porte√±os at Cepeda (1 February 1820) and San Nicol√°s (13 February 1820). However, in the final naval battle against Monteverde on 30 July 1820, Artigas was defeated by Ram√≠rez, a rival warlord from Entre R√≠os province. Campbell, who initially succeeded in escaping, was captured and banished in shackles to Paraguay. The dictator Francia, instead of putting his former foe to death, spared Campbell's life, possibly out of respect for his adversary's courage and military prowess. Peter Campbell was allowed to settle in the Paraguayan √ëeembuc√∫ Department, where he returned to his former trade of tanner. There is disagreement over the location and date of Campbell's death, which occurred around 1832. After his burial place in Villa del Pilar was discovered in 1961, his remains were handed over to Uruguay for reinterment in Montevideo on 18 May 1961. The Navy of Uruguay has several medals named after him. In addition, after being acquired by Uruguay, the USS Chickadee was renamed as the ROU Comandante Pedro Campbell (MSF-1) in Campbell's honour.

It is the second memoir published by Vilar, the first being The Ladies‚Äô Gallery. Controversy Impossible Motherhood generated controversy on publication for the revelation that the author had 15 abortions in 17 years between the ages of 16 and 33. Vilar confesses to an \\"abortion addiction\\" and argues that the abortions were an act of rebellion against her controlling husband who did not want any children. In the memoir she described how between the ninth abortion and tenth pregnancy she \\"needed another self-injury to get the high.\\" Vilar also blamed American society for her actions, stating that women were expected to be perfect mothers but to achieve professionally. She states that she still holds pro- choice views but feels she has abused the procedure. The cycle of abortions began during a relationship with literary critic Pedro Cuperman. Vilar remarried in 2003 and now has two children. Reaction The work angered American pro-life groups and Vilar received death threats and hate mail after publication. The work was rejected 51 times before publishers accepted it. Dr. Lauren Streicher, clinical assistant professor at the Northwestern University School of Medicine suggested that Vilar could have mental health problems. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that pro-choice groups have been largely silent in response to the publication.

Zhao was an English student at Coquitlam College when she was reported missing on October 9, 2002, and her body was found inside a suitcase by hikers near Stave Lake on October 20, 2002, where an autopsy revealed that Zhao had been strangled to death. Two Chinese men that were living in Canada at the time, including Zhao's boyfriend, were arrested in China and charged by a Beijing court for Zhao's murder, with one being acquitted and one sentenced to 7-years imprisonment. Amanda Zhao's murder and the subsequent investigation highlighted issues with the co-operation of Canada and China in matters of justice, and issues of jurisdiction within Canadian law enforcement. Background Amanda Zhao Wei () was born in c. 1981 in the People's Republic of China, was a Chinese national, and at the time of her death a 21-year-old international student studying English at Coquitlam College located in Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada, near the city of Vancouver. On October 9, 2002, Zhao was reported missing to the authorities, and just over a week later on October 20, her corpse was discovered contained within a suitcase by hikers near Stave Lake, east of Vancouver. Investigation The two murder suspects in the case, Li Ang (ÊùéÊòÇ) and Zhang Han (Âº†ÁÄö), were arrested in China in the summer of 2009. The prime suspect Li Ang, who was Zhao's boyfriend at the time of murder, was initially in Canada when Zhao's body was found. Li was a Chinese national and a computer science student at Simon Fraser University, located in the Vancouver area. Zhang Han, who was Li's cousin, was also implicated in the case. He later confessed that he had helped Li dispose of Zhao's body and helped Li travel back to China after the murder. Zhang's confession led to him being charged as an accessory after the fact in Zhao's murder. However, he was later acquitted by the British Columbia Supreme Court because the confession had been improperly obtained. Zhao, Li, and Zhang shared a basement apartment in Burnaby at the time of murder. Eleven days before the body was found, Li reported to police that Zhao was missing after she went to buy groceries at the local Safeway store. However, three days after Zhao's body was found, Li returned to China. Li was initially questioned by the RCMP on the case, but it was not until seven months after the murder that the RCMP issue a warrant for his arrest, and is being charged with second-degree murder in absentia by the Canadian government. In 2004, Li had been taken into custody by the Chinese government but was later released due to lack of evidence. Li was arrested by Chinese authorities again and convicted in September 2012, and sentenced to life in prison. Zhang was released and is not scheduled to be tried. In 2014, Li's sentence was changed by the Supreme court of Beijing to 7 years. The original first degree murder charge has been changed to secondary degree murder charge as the Supreme court of Beijing ruled that Zhao was accidentally killed by Li during a pillow play fight. The court decision was controversial as the court ruled without any new evidence Aftermath The arrests for Amanda Zhao's murder took many years to complete, and responsibility was found to be mainly because the Canadian government is reluctant in giving evidence of murder cases to China, as Chinese authorities allow for capital punishment for murder, which is illegal in Canada. On October 13, 2009, Secretary of State for Multiculturalism Jason Kenney said that China's capital punishment policy has been a problem in the case. Zhao's murder was of great interest in the Chinese community in Canada because it exposed the lack of an extradition treaty between Canada and the People's Republic of China for crimes committed in the two countries, and the lack of the RCMP's authority in retaining suspects within Canadian borders until the investigation of a crime is completed.
