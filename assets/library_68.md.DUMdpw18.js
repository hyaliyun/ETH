B. Reily & Company Inc. and specializes in selling food and beverages. The company started in the coffee and tea business and has diversified through to include condiments, dressings, seasonings, and baking products. Luzianne Iced Tea is available nationally while other products have greater distribution and demand in the Southern United States. The Reily Foods Company is headquartered in the Central Business District of New Orleans, Louisiana.\\"Contact Us.\\" Reilly Foods Company. Retrieved on January 21, 2010.  History  William B. Reily began his career in the grocery and packaged goods business in the late 1870s as a country store clerk in Bastrop, LA. After spending eight years in that position, Reily decided to open his own retail grocery store. Only two years later, Reily moved 25 miles south to Monroe, LA where he started the Southern Grocery Company, Inc., a wholesale grocery business. During this time he noticed the popularity of his coffee products and realized that he could create a profitable coffee roasting business. After 14 years of building and running his successful wholesale business in Monroe, Reily moved to New Orleans to start what would become the Reily Foods Company. On December 11, 1902, Reily and his partners began their coffee roasting, grinding and distributing company in New Orleans. At the time, more than 85% of all coffee beans imported into the United States passed through New Orleans so it gave Reily first choice of the best coffee beans available. Later the next year, the company added to its products offerings as a convenience to its customers. Both his coffee and tea products were sold under the Luzianne (a regional pronunciation of Louisiana) brand name that he created. In 1906 the company was renamed the Reily Taylor Company and then later, in 1919, became Wm. B. Reily & Co., Inc. In 1932, noticing the increased popularity of iced tea, especially in the South, Reily and his sons created a blend of tea made specifically to be used for iced tea. Luzianne Iced Tea has since become the cornerstone product of the company and the second best selling iced tea in the United States.  Major acquisitions  For the first half of the 20th century, Wm. B. Reily & Co. and the Reily Foods Company remained a producer of only Luzianne coffee and tea products. It wasn‚Äôt until its 1965 acquisition of the JFG Coffee Company that Reily Foods began diversifying their product offerings. Though JFG brought with them mostly coffee brands and production facilities, Reily also acquired a small regional mayonnaise brand. Three years later, Reily acquired CDM coffee from Blue Plate Foods, a wildly popular brand of coffee in New Orleans that had been around since before the start of the 20th century. In 1974, Reily purchased Blue Plate Foods from the Hunt-Wesson Company, which added Blue Plate Mayonnaise to their list of brands. Blue Plate was the first commercially prepared mayonnaises and is one of the most popular brands of mayonnaise in the South. Over the next 30 years, Reily acquired several brands from both regional and national companies. They include Swans Down Cake Flour, Try Me Sauces & Seasonings (namely Tiger Sauce), Wick Fowler's 2-Alarm Chili, La Martinique Salad Dressings, Carroll Shelby's Original Texas-Style Chili, Presto Cake Flour, No Pudge Fat Free Brownie Mix, French Market Coffees, New England Tea & Coffee.  The Reily family  Throughout its 100+ years of existence, the Wm. B. Reily & Company and the Reily Foods Company has been run by a member of the Reily family. From 1902 to 1932, William B. Reily led the company from a startup coffee roasting company to one of the region's top suppliers of coffee and tea products. From 1932 to 1968, his two sons (William B. Reily, Jr. and James W. Reily) took control of the company, leading it to rapid expansion in the coffee and tea markets. In 1968, William B. Reily III took control of the company and in the years since has led the diversification of its product offerings through product innovations and acquisitions. Currently, the fourth generation of family, Wm. B. Reily IV, serves as President & CEO of the parent company, Wm. B. Reily & Co., Inc. The family home of Wm B Reily, Kalorama, in Collinston Louisiana 5 miles south of Bastrop is now a nature preserve open to the public, and has been added to the national register of historic places  Brands  *Luzianne **Luzianne Iced Tea **Luzianne Coffees **Luzianne Cajun Foods *French Market Coffees *New England Tea & Coffee *Bonus Blend Coffees *JFG Coffees *JFG Mayonnaise *Coffee Partner Ground Chicory *Blue Plate Mayonnaise *La Martinique Dressings *Try Me Sauces & Seasoning *Carroll Shelby Chili *Wick Fowler Chili *Swans Down Cake Flour *Presto Self-Rising Cake Flour *No Pudge!

It tells the story of Quentin Coldwater, a young man who discovers and attends a secret college of magic in New York. The novel received critical acclaim and was followed by a sequel, The Magician King, in 2011The Magician King at Lev Grossman's website and a third novel, The Magician's Land, in 2014. A television series adaptation of the novels premiered on Syfy in 2015. Grossman has also worked on two comic books stories based on his novels. Plot Quentin Coldwater is a high school student from Brooklyn who, along with best friends James and Julia, attends an advanced school. He loves a series of books called \\"Fillory and Further,\\" which involve the children of the Chatwin family discovering a Narnia-esque land called Fillory. On the day of his Princeton interview, Quentin instead interviews at Brakebills College for Magical Pedagogy, the only school for magic in North America, and is accepted as one of the twenty new students. Julia also takes the exam but fails. As per protocol, Julia's memory is wiped to prevent her from remembering magic's existence or the school itself. After beginning his studies at Brakebills, it soon becomes apparent to Quentin that magic is difficult and tedious to learn, as each spell must be varied in dozens of ways, depending on factors such as the phase of the moon and the closest body of water. The curriculum involves learning many old and lost languages, and innumerable hand positions. Despite this, Quentin and his classmates Penny and Alice are allowed to move up a year by compressing their first year of studies. Penny fails the special exam and stays behind, then later fistfights Quentin out of jealousy. One day during class, a bored Quentin tampers with a spell and an otherworldly horror referred to as \\"the Beast\\" enters Brakebills. It eats a student before the rest of the faculty are able to drive it away. Third year students are assigned a Discipline. Although Quentin's Discipline does not manifest itself to the teachers, he and Alice are sorted into the Physical magic group. The Physical Kids also include Eliot, Josh, and Janet, who are a year above them. During the spring semester of their fourth year, they are all sent to Brakebills South in Antarctica where they practice in silence and isolation. There, Quentin and Alice begin a relationship. During a summer vacation in Massachusetts, Quentin is confronted by Julia about the school. The memory erasure did not work correctly and she has become deranged and obsessed with learning magic. Quentin tells her the school's location, hoping she will have her memory properly erased. Upon graduation, Quentin and the other Physical Kids spend their days and nights in hedonistic pursuits. While still looking for a purpose, his erstwhile classmate Penny arrives with news about travel between worlds: Fillory is real. The group finds magical wonders in Fillory and meet The Beast, who is revealed to be Martin Chatwin, the lost eldest child from the \\"Fillory and Further\\" books, who has sacrificed his humanity in order to stay in the magical world forever. After a brutal fight, Alice sacrifices herself to kill Martin, Penny loses both of his hands and chooses to remain in the Neitherlands, a realm between the worlds, and a gravely injured Quentin is left in the care of a group of centaurs while the others fear that he will never awaken from his coma. Upon awakening many months later, Quentin becomes depressed and disillusioned, especially when Jane, the youngest Chatwin, reveals herself to have been pulling the strings throughout her siblings' and Quentin's stories. By using a magical time-traveling device, she finally succeeded in killing Martin by leading Quentin and his friends to the confrontation. Back on Earth, Quentin takes a high-paying non-magical job where he spends his time playing video games. One day, Eliot and Janet show up with Julia, who has learned magic, to return as Kings and Queens to Fillory. Major characters * Quentin Makepeace Coldwater ‚Äì A high school student strongly attached to a series of children's books about a magical land called Fillory, Quentin discovers and attends a college of magic before discovering Fillory is real and traveling there. * Alice Quinn ‚Äì A talented and natural magician whom Quentin meets while attending Brakebills. She is initially extremely reserved, but opens up when she is placed with Quentin in the Physical Magic group. She and Quentin eventually develop a relationship. * Eliot Waugh ‚Äì A talented magician, and close friend of Quentin's. He is two years older than Quentin and Alice, and in the same year as Josh and Janet. * Josh Hoberman ‚Äì The jokester-slacker of the Physical Magic group, Josh offers much of the novel's comic relief. * Janet ‚Äì Another student in the Physical Magic group. Janet is portrayed as both deeply insecure and surprisingly strong. She is called \\"Janet Way\\" by another student in the first book, but \\"Janet Pluchinsky\\" by Dean Fogg in the second. * Penny (William) ‚Äì A student who enters Brakebills with Alice and Quentin. He proves the existence of Fillory and finds passage to it. * Julia Wicker ‚Äì A brilliant and driven self- taught magician. After failing the entrance exam at Brakebills, she learns magic through the gritty underground scene. Influences Grossman has publicly discussed his literary influences and has referred to T.H. White as his \\"literary mentor\\", particularly to the influence that The Once and Future King has had on his work. The novel and its sequels are also greatly indebted to C.S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia. Other literary influences include Harry Potter, A Wizard of Earthsea, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, Watchmen, Larry Niven's Warlock stories, and Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and Gray Mouser stories, while the film Highlander helped influence the feel of the novel's world. He had originally wanted to provide a direct connection to Lewis' novels and include The Wood between the Worlds, however his publishing house's lawyers objected. He consequently replaced its appearance with the similarly themed Neitherlands instead. Grossman has stated that the plot itself began as a dream about a beast invading a magical classroom. Reception The review by The A.V. Club gave the novel an \\"A\\", calling it \\"the best urban fantasy in years, a sad dream of what it means to want something badly and never fully reach it.\\" The New York Times review said the book \\"could crudely be labeled a Harry Potter for adults\\", injecting \\"mature themes\\" into fantasy literature. The Magicians won the 2010 Alex Award, given to ten adult books that are appealing to young adults, and its author won the 2011 John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer. Adaptations  Television  In 2011, Fox optioned but eventually declined to order a television adaptation of The Magicians. In July 2014, Syfy greenlit the production of a pilot episode, and ordered a 12-episode first season which aired in January 2016. The series was renewed for a second season consisting of 13 episodes, which aired in 2017. The Syfy series is written by John McNamara and Sera Gamble, and produced by Michael London and Janice Williams. The pilot episode was directed by Mike Cahill, and the cast includes Jason Ralph as Quentin, Olivia Taylor Dudley as Alice, Hale Appleman as Eliot, Summer Bishil as Margo Hanson (renamed from Janet in the novel), Arjun Gupta as Penny, Stella Maeve as Julia, and Rick Worthy as Henry Fogg. The series ages the characters up to graduate school students and compresses the Brakebills degree to three years. Most of the events detailed in the novel, the Antarctic trip for instance, appear to happen in Quentin's first year at Brakebills with years in the novel being roughly condensed into semesters in the TV show. Jane Chatwin is involved earlier and more heavily, and Quentin is more formally diagnosed with depression.  Comic books  Grossman contributed to two comic book adaptations of his novel in 2019, published by Boom! Studios: The Magicians: Alice's Story and The Magicians.

It was their first studio album after 2001's Welcome to Paradise. The album was finally released in 2005, shortly after the break-up of the romantic relationship between producer, guitarist Chris Telkes and singer Lacey Conner. Even with this emotional stress upon the band's core members, the album was considered Nocturne's best showcase, and features a variety of tracks that quietly hint at the past, the band did a few months of touring, and afterward, was \\"put on hold for an indefinite period of time\\". This was their last album before the band's breakup. Background and composition After leaving Invisible Records, Nocturne signed again with Triple X Records and began producing their third studio album. The album's themes deal with break-up and relationship, hinting at the 8 year-long relationship between lead singer Lacey Conner and Telkes, which ended shortly after beginning production for Guide to Extinction. The album's opening song is Shallow, written by Telkes, in which Conner's lyrics change harshly between screaming and emoting flirtatiously. The lead single I Lie was written by Conner, and its lyrics refer to relationships that go awry. The song is a Goth/Industrial metal record with some synthesizers and programming. Dirty Sanchez, Alibi and Passion all talk about break up, while songs like Class War and Dead Man are satirical criticisms of the government and actual politics. Critical reception Considered Nocturne's best, the album received positive reviews from music critics. O.M.O.M from fromoutofnowhere.com gave the album a score of 81/100 saying that \\"Nocturne have emerged from the wreckage with a solid record that is full of attitude, anger and passion\\". Greg Prato, of Allmusic however was more dismissing stating that Guide to Extinction \\"turns out to be another healthy helping of aggro/electro rock\\" further adding \\"It's admirable that Nocturne attempt to throw listeners a few curve balls, but it's hard not to feel that you've heard most of this before\\". Chris Beaumont from Blogcritics gave the album a positive review, praising Conner's vocals saying \\"Lacey Conner has a great voice, whether she is singing melodically or growling, she has a unique voice and delivery.\\" and praising the overall mixing and instrumentation. Eric Bodrero from Rocknworld gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, saying \\"Most of the tracks here are surprisingly catchy (...)

Early life and family Sivaparan was born on 28 August 1976 in Vaddukoddai in northern Sri Lanka His family were from Sangarathai near Vaddukoddai. He was educated at Jaffna Hindu College. Sivaparan married to Sivagowry Shanthamohan (Gowry), niece of Captain Ranjan Lala, on 30 October 2005. Career Sivaparan joined the militant Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 1994 aged 18. Sivaparan, who was 6 feet tall, was given the nom de guerre \\"Nediyavan\\" (tall man). After initial training Nediyavan studied at Kittu's police college. He was sent by the LTTE to Russia to study political science but did not complete the course. Nediyavan then joined the LTTE's political wing under S. P. Thamilselvan and took part in various Norwegian mediated peace talks with the Sri Lankan government. Nediyavan later worked at the LTTE's International Co-coordinating Centre (ICC) headed by Castro (Veerakulasingam Manivannan). He was entrusted with managing LTTE's finances and front organisations abroad. Nediyavan was sent to Norway in 2006 to co-ordinate the LTTE's activities abroad. When war resumed between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan military in 2006 Castro appointed Nediyavan to be in charge of the LTTE's international branches. In early 2009, as the war escalated, Nediyavan's predecessor KP re-established control over the LTTE's international branches, a move resented by Castro. KP took over the leadership of the remnants of the LTTE after it was militarily defeated in May 2009 and its leader V. Prabhakaran killed. Castro, Nediyavan and their supporters opposed KP's leadership. Nediyavan is believed to have taken over the leadership of the LTTE following the arrest of KP in August 2009 though his wife Gowry as denied this. Former Sri Lankan diplomat K. Godage has alleged that KP's arrest was the result of betrayal by Nediyavan. Nediyavan worked in a nursery school in Norway. He was head of the Tamil Coordinating Committee (TCC) in Norway. He was questioned by the Norwegian police in August 2009 for unspecified reasons. Nediyavan was arrested by Norwegian police on 18 May 2011 in connection with financing LTTE activities in the Netherlands. After being interrogated for two days by a Dutch judge and five state attorneys he was later released on bail. The police warned Nediyavan not to engage in or promote violence whilst living on Norway. Nediyavan left Oslo and moved to a place 240 km away. Nediyavan was amongst 424 individuals designated as terrorists by the Sri Lankan government in February 2014. In April 2014 the Sri Lankan police issued international arrest warrants (Interpol red notice) for 40 LTTE members including Nediyavan.

Award Theatre (also known by its full title, Schaefer Award Theatre) was a recurring television showcase of major first-run motion pictures aired between 1959 and 1968, and revived briefly in 1970. In New York City, the program ran primarily on WCBS-TV (Channel 2), except for two occasions in 1970 when it was shown on WNBC-TV (Channel 4). This special series was sponsored by Schaefer Beer, and each film run under this banner was shown with only four commercial interruptions. On WCBS-TV, this show was aired in place of their usual late-night umbrella, The Late Show, while the two WNBC-TV airings in 1970 were shown in place of that station's late-night weekend movie show, Sunday Film Festival.Each of WNBC-TV's Award Theatre airings fell on a Saturday night. On its original 1959‚Äì68 run, the program was scheduled at or before major holidays such as Easter, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas. For all but its first two years, Award Theatre was shown nine times a year. On the short-lived 1970 revival, it was aired once a month. For much of Award Theatre's run, its on-air host was CBS staff announcer Bill Gilliand. Award Theatre was also shown in some other major cities in the United States, such as on WCAU-TV (Channel 10) in Philadelphia, WBZ-TV (Channel 4) in Boston, KYW-TV (Channel 3, now WKYC) in Cleveland, and, in later years, WJRT-TV (Channel 12) in Flint, Michigan (where it aired Sunday mornings),during this same period.\\"Schaefer Adds Eighth Station to 'Award Theatre' Lineup.\\" (PDF file) Broadcasting, Feb. 25, 1963, pp. 38-39. The films aired under this umbrella in those cities may or may not have been the same as in New York. History 1959‚Äì1968 The genesis for Award Theatre began in 1959 when Schaefer Beer, through its advertising agency BBDO, bought air time for one night of WCBS-TV's The Late Show.NEWS OF TV AND RADIO ‚Äî INFORMATIONAL by Val Adams. The New York Times, May 10, 1959. The first showing under this special banner, of It Happened One Night on May 23, 1959, was successful enough to warrant a recurring series of Award Theatre showings of prestigious first-run movies. Three more such films were run in 1959, and six in 1960, before being set at a total of nine annual presentations from 1961 on. Some of the highest ratings WCBS-TV attained for its late night movies were aired under the Award Theatre banner. In 1962, for example, the station's presentation of Mister Roberts brought channel 2 its highest ratings in the 11:15 PM time slot up to that point,Now the Earlier, Earlier Show by Hollis Alpert. The New York Times Magazine, August 11, 1963. However, Alpert erroneously listed The Late Show as the venue on which this film ran at the time of this ratings milestone. scoring a 39.9 rating and an 80 share.Per WCBS-TV ad in The New York Times, December 5, 1962. This figure would be surpassed in 1964 when WCBS's Award Theatre screening of From Here to Eternity attained a 45.6 rating and an 85 share.Per WCBS-TV ad in The New York Times, April 23, 1964. It was estimated that the annual Award Theatre screenings netted an average of $1 million a year for WCBS-TV.Schaefer TV Series Ending; Good Films Too Scarce by George Gent. The New York Times, December 13, 1968. By 1968, however, the proliferation of movie showcases on the three television networks, plus an increasing scarcity of quality titles for local television stations, led Schaefer to end its ongoing Award Theatre presentations in December, after a total of 82 films shown over more than 9¬Ω years.The Times article erroneously cited a figure of 65 films shown.Too Many Flicks Spoil the Ratings by Jack Gould. The New York Times, December 29, 1968. The final screening at that point was of the 1954 remake of Magnificent Obsession on December 21. 1970 revival But in early 1970, Schaefer resumed its occasional Award Theatre screenings. However, in contrast to the 1959‚Äì68 period where it was seen exclusively on WCBS-TV and scheduled to air around holiday times, the program was now seen once a month, and the beer maker divided its new airings between that station and WNBC-TV, with two films being shown on the latter station in the summer of 1970. In addition, while the earlier series of special screenings had films that were being shown for the first time on New York television, in 1970 the films selected were drawn from packages that included pictures which were previously aired on the networks. Also, in the case of WNBC-TV's airings, this was the second off- network airing for the films in question; for example, The Birds, which was shown under the Award Theatre umbrella on WNBC in August 1970, had previously aired on WABC-TV in November 1969.TV Guide, New York Metropolitan Edition, November 8‚Äì15, 1969, Iss. #867. Schaefer ended Award Theatre for good in New York City after the airing of The Caine Mutiny on September 5, 1970 (however, it would air in other cities for a few more years, with some cities running the show as late as 1973Per TV listings of The Philadelphia Inquirer for WCAU- TV's version, and The Daily Gazette (Schenectady, New York) for showings under this title on WTEN in Albany, New York.). WCBS-TV attempted to revive this format in 1973 with special monthly airings of Showcase Theatre, sponsored by Miles Laboratories and likewise airing in a few other cities (such as WPVI-TV in Philadelphia and WGN-TV in Chicago); however, it only lasted less than a year. Influence Schaefer's Award Theatre spawned a series of other movie shows on other stations in other cities that aired with little or no commercial interruption. In New York alone, for a few years in the early 1970s WOR-TV had such a movie show several times a year; at one point, these presentations were sponsored by Bounty paper towels. Another New York station, WPIX, ran top films (usually from the Samuel Goldwyn Studio) without commercial interruption on Sunday evenings, also in the early 1970s. The concept was carried on by WNEW-TV in the early to mid-1980s with The Channel 5 Movie Club.

E. F. Britten \\"Mariana\\" is a poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, published in 1830. The poem follows a common theme in much of Tennyson's work‚Äîthat of despondent isolation. The subject of \\"Mariana\\" is a woman who continuously laments her lack of connection with society. The isolation defines her existence, and her longing for a connection leaves her wishing for death at the end of every stanza. The premise of \\"Mariana\\" originates in William Shakespeare's Measure for Measure, but the poem ends before Mariana's lover returns. Tennyson's version was adapted by others, including John Everett Millais and Elizabeth Gaskell, for use in their own works. The poem was well received by critics, and it is described by critics as an example of Tennyson's skill at poetry. Tennyson wrote \\"Mariana\\" in 1830 and printed it within his early collection Poems, Chiefly Lyrical.Hugh 1988 p. 54 Previously, he contributed poems to the work Poems by Two Brothers (1827), where his early poems dealing with isolation and memory can be found. The theme was continued in the later collection, with poems like \\"Mariana\\", \\"Ode to Memory\\", and others representing the earlier poems.Barton 2008 p. 20 During a visit to the Pyrenees during the summer of 1830, Tennyson sought to give aid to Spanish rebels. During that time, he was affected by his experience and the influence appears in Mariana in the South,Land 1970 p. 20 which was published in 1832; it is a later version that follows the idea of \\"The Lady of Shalott\\".Pattison 1979 pp. 55‚Äì56 Structure Many of Tennyson's poems are in the form of a dramatic monologue. However, \\"Mariana\\", like \\"The Lady of Shallott\\", is more accurately a lyrical narrative. It contains elements of dramatic monologies in that it contains a refrain that carries through the poem as found in \\"Oriana\\" and other poems. \\"Oriana\\" is completely a dramatic monologue and \\"Mariana\\" is not because Tennyson represents how the title figure is unable to linguistically control her own poem, which reinforces the themes of the poem. This technique is used again in Tennyson's later poem, \\"The Two Voices\\".Hughes 1988 pp. 26, 54, 107 The rhyme scheme of the poem, ABAB CDDC EFEF, is different than the standard ballad rhyme that serves to contain the poem then allow a free expression. The middle quatrain of the stanzas returns in theme to the beginning in a cyclical pattern while the last quatrain's lines contain the same words.Jordan 1988 p. 60 Poem Mariana in the South by John William Waterhouse (1897) Within the poem, Tennyson does not teach the audience what melancholy means. Instead, he describes its various aspects as he begins:Eagleton 2007 p. 111 The narrator of the poem is disconnected from Mariana, and he is able to see what she cannot. In particular, he is able to describe the \\"sweet heaven\\" whereas Mariana refuses to take in the scene as well as she is unable to understand the movement of time:Jordan 1988 p. 61 She is surrounded by stillness and there is little movement within the poem. The water is calm and there is only the growth of moss: Mariana is trapped by her surroundings, and the last stanza begins with her becoming sensitive to sound as she starts to mentally lose her place in reality:Glancy 2002 p. 132 The poem ends with a description that even the sunlight is unable to do anything more than reveal dust in her home: The poem ends with an altered version of the refrain, which serves to show that although she wishes her death she is still alive and, in the final moment, allows her to end the poem instead of allowing the poem to end her:Barton 2008 p. 27 Themes Mariana by John Everett Millais (1851). Tennyson's poems traditionally rely on the use of visual imagery for effect. In \\"Mariana\\", Tennyson instead emphasises auditory imagery that serves to emphasise her solitude. Her hearing is sensitive and she is able to hear every sound, which only reveals the silence of her surroundings. Her solitude and loneliness causes her to be unable to recognise the beauty of her surroundings, and the world to her is dreary.Andres 2004 pp. 62, 64 In contrast to Tennyson's other poems, including \\"The Lady of Shalott\\", there is no movement within \\"Mariana\\". There is also a lack of a true ending within the poem, unlike the later version Mariana in the South, which reworks the poem so there is a stronger conclusion that can be found within death.Jordan 1988 p. 59 The character of Mariana is connected to Shakespeare's Measure for Measure; there is a direct quotation of Shakespeare's play in regards to a character of the same name. In Shakespeare's play, Mariana is rejected by the character Angelo and lives alone as she pines over her love.Andrews 2004 p. 62 Tennyson's version is set in Lincolnshire, not Vienna as in the Shakespeare play. This makes the characters completely English. Additionally, the scene within the poem does not have any of the original context but the two works are connected in imagery with the idea of a dull life and a dejected female named Mariana.Lyall 1878 p. 478 Tennyson is not the only one that uses the image; John Everett Millais's 1851 painting Mariana is based on Tennyson's version of Mariana, and lines 9 through 12 of Tennyson's poem were used for the catalogue description of the painting. Similarly, Millais's version served as the inspiration for Elizabeth Gaskell's novel, Ruth. Tennyson's Mariana and Gaskell's main character, Ruth, are sensitive to the sounds around them and are constantly looking out of their window in image that represents their imprisonment within their homes. The image of Mariana used by Tennyson and the later works are equally of a woman who is weary.Andrews 2004 pp. 59‚Äì63 The depictions of Mariana by Tennyson and in later works are not the same. The difference with Millais's depiction is not in the image of a forlorn woman or of a woman who is unwilling to live an independent life; instead, it is her sexualised depiction that is greater than found in Tennyson. His version also removes the dreariness of Tennyson's and replaces it with a scene filled with vibrant colours. Gaskell's depiction is of Ruth is similar to Tennyson in her weariness and wanting to die. However, she is a sexually independent figure when she rejects her lover who has returned. Tennyson's character, on the other hand, would likely have happily accepted her lover. While Tennyson's character cannot recognise beauty within nature, Gaskell's character is able to turn to nature to gain spiritually in a manner similar to the Romantic poems, including \\"Tintern Abbey\\" by William Wordsworth or \\"This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison\\" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.Andrews 2004 pp. 63‚Äì64 There is also a connection with Mariana's condition and the condition within Coleridge's Dejection: An Ode. However, the narrator at the end of Dejection is able to be roused into movement whereas Mariana never reaches that point. Furthermore, \\"Mariana\\" is unlike the Romantic poems because the character is not one with nature or able to achieve transcendence through imagination. Furthermore, there is little outside of Mariana that exists within the poem as Mariana's mood does not respond to changes in nature.Jordan 1988 p. 62 In terms of Tennyson's other poems, there is a strong connection between the character Mariana and Tennyson's other female characters. Both \\"Mariana\\" and \\"Oriana\\" have characters that experience a mental imprisonment, which are revealed in the poetic refrains. However, Oriana is able to have control over her own story when she serves as narrator of it while Mariana is denied control by Tennyson's use of a third-person narrative structure. The difference is further compounded by Oriana's imprisonment coming from her own memories while Mariana's is the external results of her lover having not returned. The character Fatima of Fatima is connected to \\"Mariana\\" simply because she is a reversal of Mariana's character: Fatima, like Mariana, waits for her lover but suffers from an intense passion that causes her to lose control over her mind while also being able to experience the world around her. The character Oenone of \\"Oenone\\" is a combination of aspects from both Mariana's and Fatima's characters.Hughes 1988 pp. 54‚Äì55, 64‚Äì65 In the revised version Mariana in the South, the second Mariana is similar to the Lady of Shalott in that they both live in a world between fantasy and reality.Pattison 1979 pp. 57 Sources Many sources for the poem and passages within the poem have been suggested by various editors or critics of Tennyson's poet. These sources include passages in the poetry of Sappho and Cinna, Virgil's Aeneid, Horace's Odes, Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and Measure for Measure, John Milton's Lycidas, Samuel Rogers's Captivity, and John Keats's Isabella, Sleep and Poetry, and The Eve of St. Agnes. However, there is little evidence to suggest that Keats, though well respected by Tennyson, influenced the poem although Keats's Isabella is linguistically similar to \\"Mariana\\" and could serve as a parallel. If Isabella is parallel to \\"Mariana\\" in terms of dealing with women who have lost their lovers, so too could Virgil's Aeneid be described as a parallel to the poem.Pattison 1979 pp. 8‚Äì9 There is no evidence to suggest that Cinna's poems influenced Tennyson since Tennyson admitted to not having read Cinna. Thematically, \\"Mariana\\" is different from the writing of Horace although Tennyson does rely on a lyrical style similar to both Cinna and Horace. A relationship with the poetry of Sappho is more likely than to Cinna, as there is a sexual element to Sappho's poem as well as Tennyson favouring Sappho as a poet. The poem by Rogers was a favourite of Tennyson's and has a sexual element that is similar to Tennyson; both poems describe a woman longing for her lover as she is isolated and in a captive state. There are probably intentional echos of Romeo and Juliet and Measure for Measure within the poem, with the latter play being the source of Mariana's character. The reference to Lycidas is minor and is more likely a generic phrase than a direct use of Milton's poem.Pattison 1979 pp. 9‚Äì12 Critical response Jonathon Wearworth wrote in his early career, \\"The poem [Mariana] is an outstanding insight into the primitive ideal that is Tennyson's take on life in all its worthlessness.\\" In an early review in the 1831 Westminster Review, J. Fox praises the depiction of women within the whole of Poems, Chiefly Lyrical and says that Tennyson's \\"portraits are delicate, his likenesses [...] perfect, and they have life, character, and individuality. They are nicely assorted also to all the different gradations of emotion and passion which are expressed in common with the descriptions of them. There is an appropriate object for every shade of feeling, from the light touch of passing admiration to the triumphant madness of soul and sense, or the deep and everlasting anguish of survivorship.\\"Fox 1831 pp. 210‚Äì224 A review by a \\"Professor Lyall\\" in 1878 argues, \\"As descriptive poetry, and for that feature of realistic description so characteristic of Tennyson's muse, 'Mariana' has, perhaps, not been surpassed even by him.\\" Harold Nicolson, in 1923, viewed the dreariness of \\"Mariana\\" and Tennyson's other early works as an aspect that makes the early works better than his later works.Bayley 2005 pp. 142‚Äì143 In T. S. Eliot's 1936 Essays Ancient and Modern, he praises Tennyson's ability to represent the visual, tactile, auditory, and olfactory aspects of the scene.Singh 2005 p. 7 Later in 1972, Christopher Ricks argues that the poem is \\"one of Tennyson's masterpieces in the art of the penultimate\\".Ricks 1972 p. 49 Elaine Jordan argues, in her 1988 analysis of Tennyson's works, that the poem's depiction of \\"self-infolding [...] is a negation which involves the drawing-in of forces in order perhaps to assert the self differently. Mariana is the most powerful expression, very early, of such a moment, though its assertiveness exists only as strong gloom in image and rhythm, not as narrative possibility except in the desire for an end to it all preferred over patience.\\" In 2002, Ruth Glancy writes, \\"In the last stanza, Mariana's grip on the present is loosening, and Tennyson's mastery of sound and images is evident (even in this early poem) in his description of the house that echoes her utter desolation\\". Anna Barton, in her 2008 analysis, declares Mariana \\"the most famous heroine of the 1830 volume\\" and that both The Ballad of Oriana and \\"Mariana\\" are \\"poems of greater substance that develop the poetic that Tennyson begins to establish in his briefer songs\\".Barton 2008 pp. 22‚Äì23 Notes References * Andres, Sophia.

Safari is a video game first released by Sega in 1999. The original arcade version of the game used the Naomi board, arcade hardware which was based on Sega's Dreamcast video game console. Despite the fact that other Naomi-based arcade games were released for the Dreamcast, Jambo! Safari was never ported to the Sega console. The UK version of the Official Dreamcast Magazine reported that the game was to be released in a 3-in-1 compilation along with other games in Sega's \\"Real Life Career Series\\", Brave Firefighters and Emergency Call Ambulance, but such a game was never released and neither of the other two games were ported either. Sega released versions of the game for the Wii and Nintendo DS, under the title Jambo! Safari: Animal Rescue on November 17, 2009.  Gameplay  In Jambo! Safari, players use a steering wheel and a gear shift to pursue animals in a jeep and catch them using a lasso. Players can select from four different player characters and several different vehicles to drive. The Wii version has the same gameplay as the arcade game, modified to accommodate the Wii's motion controls. In the Wii version, the Wii Remote is used for the lasso controls and the nunchuk is used to steer the vehicle. In addition to new controls and updated graphics, the Wii version also has new options such as customizable characters and vehicles. The Wii version's story mode centers roaming the in-game environment in search of missions to complete and gaining experience points to become a full-fledged park ranger. Players can also interact with captured animals, treat their injuries and feed them. The game also features other new modes such as co- operative missions, and four-player party games such as ostrich racing. In the Wii game, players can also choose a mode based on the original arcade game. The DS version of the game focuses on educating young players about animals during gameplay.

Early life and career Born in Khartoum, Sudan, he received his Ph.D. and M.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1984 and 1982 respectively, and his B.Tech degree in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur in 1981. Banerjee began his career in academia, in which he served 22 years. After he became a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Northwestern, it frustrated him that while his graduate students and himself were developing technologies they weren't having much success at getting others to use these technologies. This frustration with the lack of transfer from academia to the consumer is what motivated Banerjee to found AccelChip Inc. While on leave from Northwestern University (2000 to 2002), Banerjee, with the help of his team of graduate students, started AccelChip Inc., a developer of products and services for electronic design automation. He served at AccelChip Inc. as president and CEO, raising $2.3 million in financing, helping the company build its first product and guiding the company's growth to 25 employees and $800,000 in revenues.

HP role As the senior vice president of research at Hewlett Packard, Banerjee helped develop technical strategies for the company. He also headed up HP Labs, the company's central research organization, which had seven locations worldwide. Under him, Hewlett-Packard's laboratories had placed larger bets on fewer projects, and have systematically sought outside ideas. He has dismissed the cast-offs as interesting science projects and championed the survivors as big bets with the most commercial potential. He led a group of 500 researchers, whose objective was to innovate five to 15 years beyond the focus of the rest of the company's 30,000 R&D; engineers. Banerjee believes in having locations for research organizations in various locations around the world (currently HP Labs has seven locations, including India, Russia, China and Israel) ‚Äì not for access to cheap labor, but for ability to tap into innovation in local markets tailored to those local markets.Wedding innovation with business value: An interview with the director of HP Labs,\\" McKinsey Quarterly (2010).

She was born to an Orthodox Jewish family in Vienna, Austria in 1923. Her parents were Meier Haftel and Gisa Braten. Forced to flee to France in 1938 after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, Haftel soon after joined her family in England, where they were then interned as 'enemy aliens' on the Isle of Man, where she made her acting debut, appearing in a German-language production of As You Like It. At the camp, she heard a concert of the Danish-Icelandic folk singer Engel Lund, and it was exposure to Lund's repertoire, which included traditional Yiddish songs, that inspired Haftel to pursue a musical career. Living in London after the war, she supported herself doing office work while studying voice and piano and occasionally performing on stage and radio. Emigrating to the United States in 1948, Haftel married her first husband, Hans Schlamme. She supported herself performing an ever-increasing repertoire of folk songs in multiple languages in nightclubs and concert venues in the Catskills and elsewhere. Her early recorded work began during this period and was recorded in collaboration with the Israeli composer Nachum Nardi. In 1954, she recorded the album German Folk-Songs with the then-blacklisted singer Pete Seeger. Aside from this album for Folkways Records, she would later record for the Vanguard, Columbia and MGM labels. In 1959, her album of songs composed by Kurt Weill at the Edinburgh Festival led to wider awareness of her work; she herself said it made her \\"a star overnight\\". MGM released her albums The World of Kurt Weill in Song in 1962 and A Kurt Weill Cabaret in 1963. The label further issued (Martha Schlamme says:) Kissin's No Sin in 1963. Among her stage performances were Weill's Mahagonny (Stratford Festival, Ontario, 1965), A Kurt Weill Cabaret (Ravinia Festival, 1967), Fiddler on the Roof (as Golde, Broadway, 1968) and several one-woman shows, including A Woman Without a Man Is.... Her television appearances as herself include the series Hootenanny (1963), Rainbow Quest (1965), Talk of the Town (1965) and the America's Musical Theater episode \\"Happy End\\" (1985). She also appeared in a small role in the 1980 television movie Playing for Time (as \\"Woman on train\\"). She continued to perform until her death in 1985, two months after suffering a stroke while onstage in Jamestown, New York. She was 62 years old.

He was first elected to Parliament at the Eglinton riding in the 1940 general election, the only Toronto Liberal candidate in that election to defeat a Conservative candidate, namely Richard Langton Baker. After completing one term in the House of Commons, Hoblitzell did not seek further re-election, indicating that the \\"pressure of business\\" precluded a re-election campaign in the 1945 election. After leaving federal politics, Hoblitzell returned to business interests, particularly with Anglo Petroleum. In 1949, he was convicted of three Foreign Exchange Control Act infractions involving his business dealings and was fined $4500. In 1951, he was convicted of another charge of purchasing $25,000 in alcoholic beverage, mining, railway stocks without approval by the Foreign Exchange Control Board, under a scheme where he arranged with a New Jersey broker to buy the stocks then pass these along to a \\"W.F.

The house was built in 1937 by Ole K. Olson for Milton Odem, a local theater owner. It is one of the best examples of residential Streamline Moderne architecture in Oregon. The Milton Odem House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.  History  Milton Odem was born in Enid, Oklahoma in 1906. He moved to Idaho as a boy, growing up in Grangeville and Lewiston. Odem arrived in Redmond with his wife in 1923. They bought an existing theater and renamed it the Mayfair, turning it into a successful business. Odem later built a second movie theater in downtown in Redmond; and then a drive-in theater on the outskirts of the city. Over the years, he also served on the Redmond Airport Commission, the Redmond City Planning Commission, and the Redmond City Council.\\"Odem, Milton House\\", National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, National Park Service, United States Department of Interior, Washington, D.C., 8 January 1997.\\"Milton Odem House\\", Deschutes County Landmarks, Deschutes County, Bend, Oregon, 17 January 2001.\\"Odem, Milton House\\", Designated Sites, Redmond Deschutes County Inventory of Historic Landmarks, Deschutes County, Bend, Oregon, 6 May 2003. In 1937, Odem decided to build a new theater to accommodate the influx of movie goers from the Civilian Conservation Corps camp at Camp Sherman and workers at the new Redmond Air Field. He called the new theater the Odem. Odem chose a sleek modern design for his new theater, an architectural style known as Streamline Moderne. The style features aerodynamic lines, chromium steel, colored vitreous marble, tubular neon, stucco walls, glass blocks, tinted mirrors, and recessed lighting. All these features combine to create a streamlined industrial look which was very popular at the time, especially for theaters and commercial buildings.\\"Streamline Moderne\\" , Style Guide, Deschutes County Landmarks, Deschutes County, Bend, Oregon, 8 August 2009. Not only did he build his new Odem theater in that style, he also built a new Streamline Moderne home the same year the theater was constructed. The home was located on a 50 by lot on the west side of 12th Street in southwest Redmond. The Odem family only lived in the house for three years, moving to another home in the Redmond area in 1940. In 1940, a back porch was added to the home and a garage was built on the northwest corner of the lot. A year later, the new owners added a second bedroom to the northwest corner of the house. With that addition, today's historic structure was complete. Subsequent alterations changed some of the original characteristics. For example, in the 1970s, the original double-hung windows were replaced by aluminum frame windows. The original doors were also replaced during that period. A major renovation of the Odem house was completed in the spring of 1996, bringing back much of the original detail using historic photography to guide the work. Because of its unusual Streamline Moderne design, the Milton Odem House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 21 February 1997. At the time it was listed, the Milton Odem House was the only Streamline Moderne residential property in Oregon listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Today, the Odem house remain one of the best examples of a Streamline Moderne residence in the state of Oregon.\\"Milton Odem House\\", National Register of Historic Places, www.nationalregisterofhistoricalplaces.com, 8 August 2009.  Structure  Ole Knutte Olson for Milton Odem and his wife, Flossie. It is a small one-story bungalow that measures 26 by . The house is an excellent example of a Streamline Moderne style residence, highlighting many of the style's most notable features. For example, the design features prominent horizontal lines, asymmetrical fa√ßade, flat roof, broad overhanging eaves, stucco exterior walls, a large corner window, and Art Deco style hardware inside. There are two historic buildings on the property, the main house and a small garage on the northwest corner of the property *The main house has a balloon-frame structure on a concrete foundation. The roof is flat with a parapet wall running along the roof edge to conceal the asphalt roof. There is a large overhanging eave on the northeast front and north sides of the building. The exterior is covered with spatter-dashed stucco. The living room picture windows are casement style, set at a 110 degree angle. The remaining windows are a two-over-two double-hung type with horizontal muntins. The original doors were replaced in the 1970s. Unfortunately, there are no photographs of the originals doors so an appropriate Streamline Moderne style door with a round port window was installed during the 1996 renovation. The street front fa√ßade has three wide horizontal bands set out from the main wall surface that emphasize the design's horizontal orientation. *At the northwest corner of the lot, there is a small wood-frame garage and shop building. The garage was built in 1940. It has a shed-roof with asphalt shingles that slopes from front to back. It has 6-inch horizontal clapboard siding and bay doors. There are two windows one on the north side of the building and one on the south side. The garage faces east and was originally connected to 12th Street by a gravel driveway. Today, the gravel lane has been replaced by a concrete driveway. Inside the garage there are two areas, a main space for storing a car and a small tool shop area.  Interior  With only of interior space, the Milton Odem House is designed to be compact and functional. The interior reflect the overall Streamline Moderne design concept. The interior walls are lath and plaster. The living room and dining room floors are covered with 2-inch oak tongue-and-groove decking while the floors in the remaining rooms have 3-inch fir decking. The living room and adjoining dining room are divided by an archway. The living room measures 10 by and the dining room is 9 by 9. Both rooms have recessed alcove shelve features with arched tops. The dining room also has a built-in five-drawer china cabinet. The front bedroom is 11 by and the adjoining bathroom is 5 by . The bathroom has chrome fixtures and a glass block exterior window. In 1996, the kitchen was expanded to incorporate the back porch area. While not part of the original design, the change was necessary to accommodates modern living. The rear bedroom was added in 1941. It measures 13 by . It has two large windows on the southwest corner of the room overlooking the back yard and another window on the north side of the room. The house still has its original rose crystal door knobs and brass hardware; however, none of the original lighting fixtures remain.

The commando was formed in August 1940 in the United Kingdom. No. 7 Commando was transferred to the Middle East as part of Layforce. Committed to the Battle of Crete, it suffered heavy casualties, after which it was disbanded. Background The commandos were formed in 1940, by the order of Winston Churchill the British prime minister. He called for specially trained troops that would \\"develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast\\".Chappell, p.5 At first they were a small force of volunteers who carried out small raids against enemy occupied territory,Chappell, p.3 but by 1943 their role had changed into lightly equipped assault Infantry which specialised in spearheading amphibious landings.Moreman, p.8 The man initially selected as the overall commander of the force was Admiral Sir Roger Keyes himself a veteran of the landings at Galipoli and the Zeebrugge raid in the First World War.Chappell, p.6 Keyes resigned in October 1941 and was replaced by Admiral Louis Mountbatten. By the autumn of 1940 more than 2,000 men had volunteered for commando training, and what became known as the Special Service Brigade was formed into 12 units called commandos.Haskew, p.48 Each commando would number around 450 men commanded by a lieutenant colonel. They were sub divided into troops of 75 men and further divided into 15-man sections. Commandos were all volunteers seconded from other British Army regiments and retained their own cap badges and remained on their regimental roll for pay.Moreman, p.12 All volunteers went through the six-week intensive commando course at Achnacarry. The course in the Scottish Highlands concentrated on fitness, speed marches, weapons training, map reading, climbing, small boat operations and demolitions both by day and by night.van der Bijl, p.12 By 1943 the commandos had moved away from small raiding operations and had been formed into brigades of assault infantry to spearhead future Allied landing operations. Three units were left un-brigaded to carry out smaller-scale raids.Moreman, pp.84‚Äì85 In 1943 the commando formation was also standardised, into a small headquarters, five fighting troops, a Heavy Weapons troop and a signals platoon. The fighting troops consisted of 65 all ranks divided into two 30-man sections which in turn were divided into three ten man sub sections. The Heavy Weapons Troop was made up of 3 inch Mortar and Vickers machine gun teams.van der Bijl, p.28 History No. 7 Commando was formed in Felixstowe in July 1940 and in December 1940 were sent to Scotland for boat training. They were then re-designated 3rd Special Service Battalion on 24 October 1941 and sent to the Middle East. On arrival in Alexandria they were assigned to Layforce - a commando unit named after Robert\\"Bob\\"Laycock - as 'A' Battalion. Their first planned operation was the invasion of Rhodes, which was later cancelled. This was followed by the raid on Bardia on 19 April 1941, which was a fiasco later publicised by Evelyn Waugh. They were next sent to take part in the Battle of Crete, assisting in the evacuation of the Allied forces who were subjected to aerial bombardment by German forces, most of the men of the commando were taken prisoner. After Crete the commando was disbanded and its personnel sent to other commando units in the theatre or returned to their previous units.Chappell 1996, p. 46.Saunders 1959, pp. 52‚Äì67.Moreman 2006, p. 19.

In the Palace of Westminster the House of Commons represents the public in 650 UK constituencies, and chooses the Prime Minister at will. The House of Lords remains unelected but can be overruled.Parliament Act 1911 and Parliament Act 1949 The Constitution of the United Kingdom is the system of rules that decides the political governance of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Unlike most countries, the UK constitution is not codified into a single document. However, the UK Supreme Court recognises that there are constitutional principles, including parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law, democracy, and upholding international law.See R (Miller) v Prime Minister [2019] UKSC 41 (Parliamentary sovereignty), R (UNISON) v Lord Chancellor [2017] UKSC 51, [67] ff (rule of law), R (Animal Defenders International) v Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sport [2008] UKHL 15, [48] (democracy), R v Lyons [2002] UKHL 44, [27] (international law). The UK Supreme Court also recognises that some Acts of Parliament have special constitutional status.Magna Carta, which in 1215 required the King to call a \\"common counsel\\" (now called Parliament) to represent people, to hold courts in a fixed place, to guarantee fair trials, to guarantee free movement of people, to free the church from the state, and to guarantee rights of \\"common\\" people to use the land.Magna Carta 1215 clauses 1 ('... the English church shall be free...'), 12 and 14 (no tax 'unless by common counsel of our kingdom...'), 17 ('Common pleas shall... be held in some fixed place'), 39-40 ('To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice'), 41 ('merchants shall have safe and secure exit from England, and entry to England') and 47-48 (land taken by the King 'shall forthwith be disafforested'). After the English Civil War and the Glorious Revolution, the Bill of Rights 1689 and the Claim of Right Act 1689 cemented Parliament's supremacy over the monarch, the church and the courts, and said that the \\"election of members of Parliament ought to be free\\". The Treaty of Union between England and Scotland in 1706, followed by two Acts of Union 1707, one in the Scottish, the other in the English parliament, unified England, Wales and Scotland. Ireland joined in a similar way through the Acts of Union 1801. The Irish Free State separated after the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty took effect in 1922. Northern Ireland chose to remain within the union. After a slow process of democratic reform, the UK guarantees every adult the equal right to vote in the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928. After World War Two, the UK became a founding member of the Council of Europe to uphold human rights, and the United Nations to guarantee international peace and security. The UK was a member of the European Union, whose predecessor the European Communities (the Common Market) it first joined in 1973, but left in 2020.European Communities Act 1972 and the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. The UK is also a founding member of the International Labour Organization and the World Trade Organization to participate in regulating the global economy.See the Versailles Treaty 1919 Part XIII and the General Treaty on Tariffs and Trade. The leading institutions in the United Kingdom's constitution are Parliament, the judiciary, the executive, and regional or local governments. Parliament is the supreme law-making body, and represents adult voters. It has two houses. The House of Commons is elected by a democratic vote in the country's 650 constituencies. The House of Lords is mostly appointed by cross-political party groups from the House of Commons. To make a new Act of Parliament, the highest form of law, both Houses must read, amend, or approve proposed legislation three times. The judiciary interprets and develops the law found in Acts of Parliament or previous cases. The highest court is the twelve person UK Supreme Court, as it decides appeals from the Courts of Appeal in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland or the Court of Session in Scotland. It does not however hear criminal appeals from Scotland. UK courts cannot declare Acts of Parliament to be unconstitutional, but can declare acts of the executive invalid, or declare any law to be incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The executive manages the United Kingdom day to day. The executive is led by the Prime Minister appointed by Parliament, and the cabinet of other Ministers, who lead the civil service departments, such as Department of Health which runs the National Health Service, or the Department of Education which funds schools and universities. There is also a monarch who serves as a ceremonial figurehead to give royal assent to new laws. The monarch has not refused to sign any new law since the Scottish Militia Bill in 1708, and it is a constitutional convention that the monarch follows the democratic will of Parliament. Most litigation over the UK constitution takes place in judicial review applications, to decide whether public bodies have complied with the law. Every public body must also follow the law, as set down in Acts of Parliament, and subject to that also statutory instruments made by the executive. Under the Human Rights Act 1998, courts may review government action to decide whether the government has followed its international commitment to the European Convention on Human Rights. This was established in 1950, following World War Two. Human rights include everyone's rights to liberty against arbitrary arrest or detention, to a fair trial, to privacy against unlawful surveillance, to freedom of expression, to freedom of association including joining trade unions, and to freedom of assembly and protest.European Convention on Human Rights 1950 arts 5 (liberty), 6 (fair trial), 8 (privacy), 10 (expression), 11 (association and assembly). Principles codified, the UK's constitution is written in hundreds of Acts of Parliament, court cases, and in documented conventions. Its essential principles are Parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law, democracy and internationalism.See AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2018) chs 1-6 Although the UK constitution is not codified, the UK Supreme Court recognises constitutional principles,AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2018) chs 1-6 and constitutional statutes,R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport [2014] UKSC 3, [207] per Lord Neuberger and Lord Mance, \\"The United Kingdom has no written constitution, but we have a number of constitutional instruments. They include Magna Carta, the Petition of Right 1628, the Bill of Rights and (in Scotland) the Claim of Rights Act 1689, the Act of Settlement 1701 and the two Acts of Union of 1707 . The European Communities Act 1972, the Human Rights Act 1998 and the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 may now be added to this list.\\" Also see Laws LJ in Thoburn v Sunderland City Council. which shape the use of political power. The main sources of constitutional law are Acts of Parliament, court cases, and conventions in the way that government, Parliament and the monarch act.Attorney General v Jonathan Cape Ltd [1975] 3 All ER 484 (on the legal nature of conventions) There are at least four main constitutional principles recognised by the courts. First, parliamentary sovereignty means that Acts of Parliament are the supreme source of law. Through the English Reformation, the Civil War, the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the Act of the Union 1707, Parliament became the dominant branch of the state, above the judiciary, executive, monarchy, and church. Parliament can make or unmake any law, a fact that is usually justified by Parliament being democratically elected, and upholding the rule of law, including human rights and international law.See T Bingham, The Rule of Law (2008) Second, the rule of law has run through the constitution since the Magna Carta 1215 and the Petition of Right 1628. This means the government may only conduct itself according to legal authority, including respect for human rights.See Entick v Carrington [1765] EWHC KB J98 and T Bingham, The Rule of Law (2008) Third, at least since 1928, democracy has become a fundamental constitutional principle. Originally only wealthy, property-owning men held rights to vote for the House of Commons, while the monarch, occasionally together with a hereditary House of Lords, dominated politics. From 1832 onwards adult citizens slowly obtained the right to universal suffrage.Great Reform Act 1832 (common property qualification rules for all boroughs and counties), Representation of the People Act 1867 (extended the franchise to around 1/3 of men), Representation of the People Act 1884 (extended the male franchise), Representation of the People Act 1918 (enabled all men to vote over 21, and women over 30 with property), and Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 (enabled equal suffrage of men at women age 21). The Representation of the People Act 1948 further abolished multiple votes for graduates of London, Cambridge and Oxford, and other University constituencies, and the Representation of the People Act 1969 lowered the voting age to 18. Restrictions on prisoner voting were inserted by the Representation of the People Act 1983. British citizens abroad can vote under the Representation of the People Act 1985, but millions of UK residents, who pay taxes but do not have citizenship, cannot vote. Fourth, the UK constitution is bound to international law, as Parliament has chosen to increase its practical power in cooperation with other countries in international organisations, such as the International Labour Organization,See the Appropriation Act 1923 Sch 4 the United Nations, the European Convention on Human Rights, the World Trade Organization, and the International Criminal Court. However, the UK left membership of the European Union, after a referendum in 2016, and a general election in 2019.In the 2016 Brexit referendum a majority of voters favoured leaving the EU, and after the 2019 membership of the EU was formally surrendered on 31 January 2020. Parliamentary sovereignty Parliamentary sovereignty is often seen as a central element in the UK constitution, although its extent is contested.See generally, AW Bradley, 'The Sovereignty of Parliament ‚Äì Form or Substance?‚Äô in J Jowell, The Changing Constitution (7th edn 2011) ch 2 It means that an Act of Parliament is the highest form of law, but also that \\"Parliament cannot bind itself.\\"cf AW Bradley and KD Ewing, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2015) 65, it 'is not possible to predict the outcome of changes made by Parliament to the 'manner and form' of the legislative process since, depending on the nature and reasons for such changes, the courts might still be influenced by a deep-seated belief in the proposition that Parliament cannot bind itself.' Historically, Parliament became sovereign through a series of power struggles between the monarch, the church, the courts, and the people. The Magna Carta 1215, which came from the conflict leading to the First Barons' War, granted the right of Parliament to exist for \\"common counsel\\" before any tax,Magna Carta 1215 cl 12, 'No scutage [tax on knight's land or fee] nor aid shall be imposed on our kingdom, unless by common counsel of our kingdom...‚Äô against the \\"divine right of kings\\" to rule. Common land was guaranteed to people to farm, graze, hunt or fish, though aristocrats continued to dominate politics. In the Act of Supremacy 1534, King Henry VIII asserted his divine right over the Catholic Church in Rome, declaring himself the supreme leader of the Church of England. Then in the Earl of Oxford's case in 1615,Earl of Oxford‚Äôs case (1615) 21 ER 485, Lord Ellesmere LC, ‚Äò... when a Judgment is obtained by Oppression, Wrong and a hard Conscience, the Chancellor will frustrate and set it aside, not for any error or Defect in the Judgment, but for the hard Conscience of the Party.' the Lord Chancellor (both the King's representative and head of the judiciary) asserted the supremacy of the Court of Chancery over the common law courts, contradicting Sir Edward Coke's assertion that judges could declare statutes void if they went \\"against common right and reason\\".Dr Bonham‚Äôs case (1610) 8 Co Rep 114a Finally, after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the Bill of Rights 1689 cemented Parliament's power over the monarch (and therefore over the church and courts). Parliament became the \\"sovereign\\", and supreme. Only 18 years later however, the English Parliament abolished itself in order to create the new ‚ÄòUnion‚Äò Parliament following on the Treaty of Union between England and Scotland, while the Scottish Parliament did likewise. Power struggles within Parliament continued between the aristocracy and common people. Outside Parliament, people from the Chartists, to the trade unions fought for the vote in the House of Commons. The Parliament Act 1911 ensured the Commons would prevail in any conflict over the unelected House of Lords. The Parliament Act 1949 ensured the Lords could only delay legislation by one year,Parliament Act 1949 s 1. and not delay any budgetary measure over a month.Parliament Act 1911 s 1. In a leading case, R (Jackson) v Attorney General, a group of pro-hunting protestors challenged the Hunting Act 2004's ban on fox hunting, arguing it was not a valid Act because it was passed avoiding the House of Lords, using the Parliament Acts. They argued that the 1949 Act itself was passed using the 1911 Act's power to override the Lords in two years. The claimants argued that this meant the 1949 Act should not be considered a valid law, because the 1911 Act was limited in scope and could not be used to amend its own limitation of the Lords' power. The House of Lords rejected this argument, holding both the Parliament Act 1949 and the Hunting Act 2004 to be valid. However, in obiter dicta Lord Hope argued that Parliamentary sovereignty \\"is no longer, if it ever was, absolute\\", and that the \\"rule of law enforced by the courts is the ultimate controlling factor on which our constitution is based\\", and cannot be used to defend unconstitutional Acts (as determined by the courts).[2005] UKHL 56, [120] 'Parliamentary sovereignty is an empty principle if legislation is passed which is so absurd or so unacceptable that the populace at large refuses to recognise it as law'. There is not yet a consensus on the meaning of \\"Parliamentary sovereignty\\", except that its legitimacy depends on the principle of \\"the democratic process\\".cf R (Simms) v SS for the Home Department [1999] UKHL 33, [2000] 2 AC 115, 131, Lord Hoffmann, 'Parliamentary sovereignty means that Parliament can, if it chooses, legislate contrary to fundamental principles of human rights. ... The constraints upon its exercise by Parliament are ultimately political, not legal. But the principle of legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost. Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts, therefore, presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual. In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.' The UK has committed to international law as a \\"sovereign\\" member, to augment its power through cooperation, in the United Nations since 1945. The first UN General Assembly was held at Methodist Central Hall, opened by Prime Minister Clement Attlee.See also a photo of the first General Assembly. In recent history, Parliament's sovereignty has evolved in four main ways.cf Leslie Stephen, The Science of Ethics (1882) 145, \\"Lawyers are apt to speak as though the legislature were omnipotent, as they do not require to go beyond its decisions. It is, of course, omnipotent in the sense that it can make whatever laws it pleases, inasmuch as a law means any rule which has been made by the legislature. But from the scientific point of view, the power of the legislature is of course strictly limited. It is limited, so to speak, both from within and from without; from within, because the legislature is the product of a certain social condition, and determined by whatever determines the society; and from without, because the power of imposing laws is dependent upon the instinct of subordination, which is itself limited. If a legislature decided that all blue-eyed babies should be murdered, the preservation of blue-eyed babies would be illegal; but legislators must go mad before they could pass such a law, and subjects be idiotic before they could submit to it.\\" First, since 1945 international cooperation meant Parliament augmented its power by working with, not dominating, other sovereign nations. The British Empire, which once colonised a quarter of the world's population and a third of its land, declined after World War I and disintegrated after World War II. While Parliament had nearly uncontested military power before, and so was thought by writers of the Imperial period to be able to \\"make or unmake any law whatever\\",AV Dicey, The Law of the Constitution (1885) 39-40, Parliament has 'under the English constitution, the right to make or unmake any law whatever; and further... no person or body is recognised by the law of England as having a right to override or set aside the legislation of Parliament.' the UK chose to join in the League of Nations in 1919, and after its failure, the United Nations 1945 to participate in building a system of international law in place of Empire. The Versailles Treaty 1919 recalled that \\"peace can only be established if it is based upon social justice\\",Treaty of Versailles 1919 Part XIII, statute of the International Labour Organization and the UN Charter, \\"based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members\\", said that \\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind\\", the UN would \\"reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights\\", and members should \\"live together in peace with one another as good neighbours\\". The Bretton Woods Agreements Act 1945, United Nations Act 1946 and International Organisations Act 1968 wrote the UK's funding and membership of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and other bodies, into law.See the International Organisations Act 1968 ss 1-8 For example, the UK bound itself to implement by order UN Security Council resolutions, up to the actual use of force, in return for representation in the General Assembly and Security Council.United Nations Act 1946 s 1 Although the UK has not always clearly followed international law,See the Legality of the Iraq War page. it has accepted formal duty that its sovereignty would not be used unlawfully. Second, in 1950 the UK helped to write and join the European Convention on Human Rights. While that convention reflected norms and cases decided under UK statutes and the common law on civil liberties,For instance, preceding art. 8 of that convention, see Entick v Carrington [1765] EWHC KB J98. On art 11, see Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co Ltd v Veitch [1941] UKHL 2 the UK accepted that people could appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, if domestic remedies were not enough. In the Human Rights Act 1998, Parliament decided that the UK judiciary should be required to apply human rights norms directly in determining UK cases, to ensure a more speedy, human rights-based resolution to case law, and effectively influence human rights reasoning more. From 1973 to 2020, the UK was a member of the European Union, which is committed to \\"human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights\\".Treaty on European Union art 2 Third, the UK became a member of the European Union after the European Communities Act 1972 and through its ratification of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. The idea of a Union had long been envisaged by European leaders, including Winston Churchill, who in 1946 had called for a \\"United States of Europe\\".e.g. 'Speech at the University of Zurich' (19 September 1946).e.g. 'Speech to the 69th Annual Conservative Party Conference at Llandudno' (9 October 1948). See J Danzig 'Winston Churchill: A founder of the European Union' (10 November 2013) EU ROPE EU law has long been held to prevail in any conflict between Acts of Parliament for the limited fields in which it operates,Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen (1963) Case 26/62, [94] member states \\"have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields, and have thus created a body of law which binds both their nationals and themselves\\" on the \\"basis of reciprocity\\". but member states and citizens gain control over the scope of EU law, and so extend their sovereignty in international affairs, through joint representation in the European Parliament, Council of the European Union, and the Commission. This principle was tested in R (Factortame Ltd) v SS for Transport, where a fishing business claimed that it should not be required to have 75% of British shareholders, as the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 said.[1990] UKHL 7. Under EU law, the principle of freedom of establishment states that nationals of any member state can freely incorporate and run a business across the EU without unjustified interference. The House of Lords held that, because the EU law conflicted with the sections of the 1988 Act, those sections would not be enforced, and disapplied, because Parliament had not clearly expressed an intention to renounce the 1972 Act. According to Lord Bridge \\"whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the [1972 Act] was entirely voluntary\\".[1990] UKHL 7 It was, therefore, the duty of the courts to apply EU law. On the other hand, in R (HS2 Action Alliance Limited) v Secretary of State for Transport the Supreme Court held that certain fundamental principles of UK constitutional law would not be interpreted by the courts as having been given up by membership of the EU, or probably any international organisation.[2014] UKSC 3. Here a group protesting against the High Speed 2 rail line from London to Manchester and Leeds claimed that the government had not properly followed an Environmental Impact Assessment Directive by whipping a vote in Parliament to approve the plan. They argued that the Directive required open and free consultation, which was not fulfilled if a party whip compelled party members to vote. The Supreme Court unanimously held the Directive did not require that no party whip occurred, but if a conflict had existed a Directive would not be able to compromise the fundamental constitutional principle from the Bill of Rights that Parliament is free to organise its affairs. Fourth, devolution in the United Kingdom has meant Parliament gave power to legislate on specific topics to nations and regions: the Scotland Act 1998 created the Scottish Parliament, the Government of Wales Act 1998 created the Welsh Assembly, the Northern Ireland Act 1998 created a Northern Ireland Executive following the historic Good Friday Agreement, to bring peace. In addition, the Local Government Act 1972 and the Greater London Authority Act 1999 give more limited powers to local and London governments. Practically, but also constitutionally, it has become increasingly accepted that decisions should not be taken for the UK which would override, and run counter to the will of regional governments. However, in Miller v Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, a group of people who sought to remain in the European Union brought the government on whether the Prime Minister could trigger Article 50 to notify the European Commission of the UK's intention to leave, without an Act of Parliament.[2017] UKSC 5 This followed the Brexit poll of 2016 where 51.9% of those voting voted to leave.See Opinion polling for the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum#Post‚Äìreferendum polling The claimants argued that, because \\"Brexit\\" would obliterate rights that Parliament had conferred through Acts (such as the right of free movement of UK citizens in the EU, the right to fair competition through merger control, and the right to vote for EU institutions) only Parliament could consent to notifying the intention to negotiate to leave under Article 50. They also argued that the Sewel Convention for devolved assemblies, where the assembly passes a motion that the Westminster Parliament can legislate on a devolved matter before it does so, meant the UK could not negotiate to leave without the Scottish, Welsh or Northern Ireland legislatures' consent. The UK Supreme Court held that Parliament must pass an Act, and could not begin the process of leaving purely through Royal Prerogative. However, the Sewel convention could not be enforced by courts, rather than observed.[2017] UKSC 5, 146. 'Judges, therefore, are neither the parents nor the guardians of political conventions; they are merely observers. As such, they can recognise the operation of a political convention in the context of deciding a legal question (as in the Crossman diaries case - Attorney General v Jonathan Cape Ltd [1976] 1 QB 752), but they cannot give legal rulings on its operation or scope, because those matters are determined within the political world. As Professor Colin Munro has stated, \\"the validity of conventions cannot be the subject of proceedings in a court of law\\" - (1975) 91 LQR 218, 228. This led Prime Minister Theresa May to procure the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017, giving her power to notify the intention to leave the EU.cf MacCormick v Lord Advocate 1953 SC 396, Lord Cooper, \\"The principle of the unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle which has no counterpart in Scottish constitutional law.\\" However this view was disapproved in R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the EU [2017] UKSC 5, [43] \\"Parliamentary sovereignty is a fundamental principle of the UK constitution\\" and at [50] \\"it is a fundamental principle of the UK constitution that, unless primary legislation permits it, the Royal prerogative does not enable ministers to change statute law or common law... This is, of course, just as true in relation to Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish law.\\" Rule of law The rule of law has been regarded as a fundamental principle of modern legal systems, including the UK.cf Aristotle, Politics (330 BCE) 3.16, 'It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens'. It has been called \\"as important in a free society as the democratic franchise\\",X v Morgan-Grampian Ltd [1991] AC 1, 48, per Lord Bridge, 'The maintenance of the rule of law is in every way as important in a free society as the democratic franchise. In our society the rule of law rests upon twin foundations: the sovereignty of the Queen in Parliament in making the law and the sovereignty of the Queen's courts in interpreting and applying the law.' and even \\"the ultimate controlling factor on which our constitution is based\\",R (Jackson) v Attorney General [2005] UKHL 56, [104] per Lord Hope but like parliamentary sovereignty, its meaning and extent is disputed. The most widely accepted meanings speak of several factors: Lord Bingham of Cornhill, formerly the highest judge in England and Wales, suggested the rule of law ought to mean that law is clear and predictable, not subject to broad or unreasonable discretion, applies equally to all people, with speedy and fair procedures for enforcement, protects fundamental human rights, and works according to international law.T Bingham, 'The Rule of Law' (2007) 66(1) Cambridge Law Journal 67 and see also T Bingham, Rule of Law (2008) 8, 'all persons and authorities within the state, whether public or private should be bound by and entitled to the benefit of laws publicly made, taking effect (generally) in the future and publicly administered in the courts.' Lord Bingham, 'The Rule of Law and the Sovereignty of Parliament' (31 October 2007) King's College, London also remarked, 'democracy lies at the heart of the concept of the rule of law'. Other definitions seek to exclude human rights and international law as relevant, but largely stem from visions of pre- democratic scholars such as Albert Venn Dicey.AV Dicey, Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution (3rd edn 1889) Part II, ch IV, 189, first \\"absolute supremacy or predominance of regular law as opposed to the influence of arbitrary power\\", second \\"equality before the law, or the equal subjection of all classes to the ordinary law of the land administered by the ordinary law courts\\" and third, \\"principles of private law have with us been by the action of the courts and Parliament so extended as to determine the position of the Crown and of its servants\\". See also J Raz, 'The Rule of Law and its Virtue' (1977) 93 Law Quarterly Review 195. Contrast D Lino, 'The Rule of Law and the Rule of Empire: A.V. Dicey in Imperial Context' (2018) 81(5) Modern Law Review 739. Previously, discourse among international finance followed a restrictive ideal: M Stephenson, 'Rule of Law as a Goal of Development Policy' (2008) World Bank Research The rule of law was explicitly recognised as a \\"constitutional principle\\" in section 1 of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, which limited the judicial role of the Lord Chancellor and recast the judicial appointments system to entrench independence, diversity and merit.Constitutional Reform Act 2005 ss 1, 63-65 and Schs 8 and 12 As statute gives no further definition, the practical meaning of the \\"rule of law\\" develops through case law. The European Court of Human Rights, following common law principles,Entick v Carrington [1765] EWHC KB J98 protects the rule of law by requiring people's liberty, privacy or other rights are not infringed by the government unless there is a clear legal basis and justification.Malone v United Kingdom (1984) 7 EHRR 14 At the core of the rule of law, in English and UK law, has traditionally been the principle of \\"legality\\". This means that the state, government, and any person acting under government authority (including a corporation),T Bingham, Rule of Law (2008) 8, 'all persons and authorities within the state, whether public or private should be bound by and entitled to the benefit of laws publicly made, taking effect (generally) in the future and publicly administered in the courts.' may only act according to law. In 1765, in Entick v Carrington a writer, John Entick, claimed that the King's Chief Messenger, Nathan Carrington, had no legal authority to break into and ransack his home, and remove his papers. Carrington claimed he had authority from the Secretary of State, Lord Halifax who issued a search \\"warrant\\", but there was no statute that gave Lord Halifax the authority to issue search warrants. Lord Camden CJ held that the \\"great end, for which men entered into society, was to secure their property\\", and that without any authority \\"every invasion of private property, be it ever so minute, is a trespass.\\"[1765] EWHC KB J98 Carrington acted unlawfully and had to pay damages. Today this principle of legality is found throughout the European Convention on Human Rights, which enables infringements of rights as a starting point only if \\"in accordance with the law\\".European Convention on Human Rights art 8 \\"(1) Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. (2) There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\\" In 1979, in Malone v Metropolitan Police Commissioner a man charged with handling stolen goods claimed the police unlawfully tapped his phone, to get evidence. The only related statute, the Post Office Act 1969 Schedule 5, stated there should be no interference in telecommunications unless the Secretary of State issued a warrant, but said nothing explicit about phone tapping. Megarry VC held there was no wrong at common law, and refused to interpret the statute in light of the right to privacy under the European Convention on Human Rights, article 8.[1979] Ch 344 On appeal, the European Court of Human Rights concluded the Convention was breached because the statute did not 'indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities.'[1984] ECHR 10, (1984) 7 EHRR 14 The judgment, however, was overshadowed by the government swiftly passing a new Act to authorise phone tapping with a warrant.Originally the Interception of Communications Act 1985, and now the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 ss 1-11, as amended by the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014. By itself the principle of legality is not enough to alone preserve human rights in the face of ever more intrusive statutory powers of surveillance by corporations or government. The most broadly accepted meaning of the rule of law, advocated by Lord Bingham of Cornhill, includes the principle of legality, human rights and commitment to democracy and international law. The rule of law also requires law is truly enforced, though enforcement bodies may have room for discretion. In R (Corner House Research) v Director of the Serious Fraud Office a group campaigning against the arms trade, Corner House Research, claimed the Serious Fraud Office acted unlawfully by dropping an investigation into the UK-Saudi Al-Yamamah arms deal. It was alleged that BAE Systems plc paid bribes to Saudi government figures.[2008] UKHL 60, [2]-[7] The House of Lords held the SFO was entitled to take into account the public interest in not pursuing an investigation, including the security threats that might transpire. Baroness Hale remarked that the SFO had to consider \\"the principle that no-one, including powerful British companies who do business for powerful foreign countries, is above the law\\", but the decision reached was not unreasonable.R (Corner House Research) v Director of the Serious Fraud Office [2008] UKHL 60, [55] When enforcement or court proceedings do take place, they should proceed swiftly: anyone who is detained must be charged and put on trial or released.See A v Home Secretary [2004] UKHL 56, Lord Nicholls, 'indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law'. People must also be able to access justice in practice. In R (UNISON) v Lord Chancellor the Supreme Court held the government's imposition of ¬£1200 in fees to bring an Employment Tribunal claim undermined the rule of law, and was void. The Lord Chancellor had statutory authority to create fees for court services, but in the case of Employment Tribunals, his Order led to a 70% drop in claims against employers for breach of labour rights, such as unfair dismissal, unlawful wage deductions or discrimination. Lord Reed said the \\"constitutional right of access to the courts is inherent in the rule of law\\". Without access to courts, \\"laws are liable to become a dead letter, the work done by Parliament may be rendered nugatory, and the democratic election of Members of Parliament may become a meaningless charade.\\"[2017] UKSC 51, [66]-[68] In principle every person is subject to the law, including government ministers, or corporate executives, who may be held in contempt of court for violating an order.e.g. M v Home Office [1993] UKHL 5, holding the Home Secretary, Kenneth Baker, in contempt of court for failing to return a Zaire teacher to the UK on refugee status, despite a High Court judge ordering it be done. In other systems the idea of a separation of powers is seen as an essential part of maintaining the rule of law. In theory, originally advocated by Baron de Montesquieu, there should be a strict separation of the executive, legislature and judiciary.Montesquieu, The Spirit of the Laws (1748) Book XI, ch 6, 'When legislative power is united with executive power in a single person or in a single body of the magistracy, there is no liberty.' While other systems, notably the United States, attempted to put this into practice (e.g. requiring the executive does not come from the legislature) it is clear that modern political parties may undermine such a separation by capturing all three branches of government, and democracy has been maintained since the 20th century despite the fact that \\"there is no formal separation of powers in the United Kingdom.\\"AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2014) 94. cf W Bagehot, The English Constitution 65, the 'efficient secret' of the UK constitution was 'the close union, the nearly complete fusion, of the legislative and executive powers'. The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 did, however, end the practice of the Lord Chancellor sitting as the head of the judiciary, while also being a Member of Parliament, and sitting in the cabinet. Since the Act of Settlement 1700, there has been only one instance of a judge being removed, and a suspension cannot happen without the Lord Chief Justice and the Lord Chancellor following a judge being subject to criminal proceedings.Constitutional Reform Act 2005 ss 108-9 There is now a duty on all ministers to \\"uphold the continued independence of the judiciary\\", including against assault by powerful corporations or the media.Constitutional Reform Act 2005 s 3. Democracy Parliament was recognised as a forum for the King for \\"common counsel\\" before the Magna Carta 1215. The principle of a \\"democratic society\\", with a functioning representative and deliberative democracy, that upholds human rights, legitimises the fact of Parliamentary sovereignty,cf A Bradley, 'The Sovereignty of Parliament ‚Äì Form or Substance?‚Äô in Jowell, The Changing Constitution (7th edn 2011) 35, 'A further question is whether the democratic process in the UK works so well as to justify the absence of any limit on the authority of Parliament to legislate.' Criticising AV Dicey, The Law of the Constitution (10th edn 1959) 73, who said 'The electors in the long run can always enforce their will', on the basis that executive dominance over Parliament might require revisions of the extent of the concept. and it is widely considered that \\"democracy lies at the heart of the concept of the rule of law\\".Lord Bingham, 'The Rule of Law and the Sovereignty of Parliament' (31 October 2007) Speech given at King's College, London. It is also a considered that the rule of law is necessary for democracy, e.g. X v Morgan-Grampian Ltd [1991] AC 1, 48, per Lord Bridge, 'The maintenance of the rule of law is in every way as important in a free society as the democratic franchise.\\" Lord Woolf [1995] PL 57, 'Our Parliamentary democracy is based on the Rule of Law.... If Parliament did the unthinkable then I would say that the courts would also be required to act in a manner which would be unprecedented.\\" Reference on Quebec (1998) 161 DLR (4th) 385, 416, \\"democracy in any real sense of the word cannot exist without the rule of law.\\" R (UNISON) v Lord Chancellor [2017] UKSC 51, [68] \\"Without such access [to courts], laws are liable to become a dead letter, the work done by Parliament may be rendered nugatory, and the democratic election of Members of Parliament may become a meaningless charade.\\" The opposite of arbitrary power exercised by one person is \\"administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few'\\".See Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War (c 411 BC) Book 2, para 37. Contrast Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book V, Parts 3 and 4, translated by DP Chase (favouring aristocracy, by equating it with appointment according \\"excellence\\", supposedly), and Plato, The Republic, Book IV, Part V, 139, translated by D Lee (arguing that philosopher kings should rule over a rigid hierarchy where there was \\"no interchange of jobs\\"). According to the preamble to the European Convention on Human Rights, as drafted by British lawyers following World War II, fundamental human rights and freedoms are themselves \\"best maintained... by \\"an effective political democracy\\".ECHR 1950 Preamble Similarly, this \\"characteristic principle of democracy\\" is enshrined by the First Protocol, article 3, which requires the \\"right to free elections\\" to \\"ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature\\".See Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v Belgium (1987) 10 EHRR 1, [47] on ECHR 1950 Prot 1, art 3 While there are many conceptions of democracy, such as \\"direct\\", \\"representative\\" or \\"deliberative\\", the dominant view in modern political theory is that democracy requires an active citizenry, not only in electing representatives, but in taking part in political life.A Lincoln, Gettysburg Address (1863) \\"that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the Earth\\". Its essence lies in not simply majority decision-making, nor referendums that can easily be used as a tool of manipulation,cf AJ Zurcher, 'The Hitler Referenda' (1935) 29(1) American Political Science Review 91 \\"but in the making of politically responsible decisions\\" and in \\"large-scale social changes maximising the freedom\\" of humankind.See FL Neumann, The Democratic and the Authoritarian State (1957) 186-193 The legitimacy of law in a democratic society depends upon a constant process of deliberative discussion and public debate, rather than imposition of decisions.J Habermas, Between Facts and Norms (1996) 135, 'the only law that counts as legitimate is one that could be rationally accepted by all citizens in a discursive process of opinion- and will- formation.' It is also generally agreed that basic standards in political, social and economic rights are necessary to ensure everyone can play a meaningful role in political life.e.g. R Dworkin, 'Constitutionalism and Democracy' (1995) 3(1) European Journal of Philosophy 2-11, 4-5, a constitutional democracy means: (1) 'a majority or plurality of people' (2) 'all citizens have the moral independence necessary to participate in the political decision as free moral agents' (3) 'the political process is such as to treat all citizens with equal concern'. D Feldman, Civil Liberties and Human Rights in England and Wales (2002) 32-33 'it would be perverse to argue that there is anything undemocratic about a restriction on the capacity of decision-makers to interfere with the rights which are fundamental to democracy itself'. See also Matadeen v Pointu [1999] 1 AC 98, Lord Hoffmann, \\"Their Lordships do not doubt that such a principle [of equality] is one of the building blocks of democracy and necessarily permeates any democratic constitution.\\" For this reason, the rights to free voting in fair elections and \\"general welfare in a democratic society\\" have developed hand-in-hand with all human rights, and form a fundamental cornerstone of international law.See Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 arts 21 and 29(2), International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966 art 25, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1966, art 4 In the UK's \\"modern democratic constitution\\",Archie v Law Association of Trinidad and Tobago [2018] UKPC 23, [18] Lady Hale, \\"A vital element in any modern democratic constitution is the independence of the judiciary from the other arms of government, the executive and the legislature. This is crucial to maintaining the rule of law: the judges must be free to interpret and apply the law, in accordance with their judicial oaths, not only in disputes between private persons but also in disputes between private persons and the state. The state, in the shape of the executive, is as much subject to the rule of law as are private persons.\\" cf KD Ewing, 'The Resilience of the Political Constitution' [2013] 14(12) German Law Journal 2111, 2116, suggesting the current political constitution of the UK is not necessarily the same as a fully democratic constitution. the principle of democracy is manifested through statutes and case law which guarantee the right to vote in fair elections, and through its use as a principle of interpretation by courts. In 1703, in the landmark case of Ashby v White, Lord Holt CJ stated that the right of everyone \\"to give [their] vote at the election of a person to represent [them] in Parliament, there to concur to the making of laws, which are to bind [their] liberty and property, is a most transcendent thing, and of an high nature\\".(1703) 2 Ld Raym 938, dissent approved by the House of Lords. This has meant that the courts actively ensure that votes cast are counted, and that democratic elections are conducted according to law. In Morgan v Simpson the Court of Appeal held that if a vote \\"was conducted so badly that it was not substantially in accordance with the law as\\" then it would be declared void, and so would even minor irregularities that would affect the result.[1975] QB 151 A considerable body of regulation, for instance in the Representation of the People Act 1983 or the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, restrict spending or any foreign interference because, according to Baroness Hale \\"each person has equal value\\" and \\"we do not want our government or its policies to be decided by the highest spenders.\\"Animal Defenders International v United Kingdom [2008] UKHL 15, [48] and see also [2013] ECHR 362 More broadly, the concept of a \\"democratic society\\" and what is \\"necessary\\" for its functioning underpins the entire scheme of interpretation for the European Convention on Human Rights as applied in UK law, particularly after the Human Rights Act 1998, because each right can usually only be restricted if \\"in accordance with law\\" and as \\"necessary in a democratic society\\". The place of the social welfare state that is necessary to support democratic life is also manifested through courts' interpretation. For instance, in Gorringe v Calderdale MBC, Lord Steyn, giving the leading judgement, said it was \\"necessary\\" to view the law of negligence in the context of \\"the contours of our social welfare state\\".Gorringe v Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council [2004] UKHL 15, [2]. See also O'Rourke v Camden London Borough Council [1998] AC 188, \\"the [Housing] Act [1985] is a scheme of social welfare, intended to confer benefits at the public expense on grounds of public policy\\". More generally, the common law has been increasingly developed to be harmonious with statutory rights,e.g. Johnson v Unisys Limited [2001] UKHL 13, and Gisda Cyf v Barratt [2010] UKSC 41, [39] and also in harmony with rights under international law. Internationalism Like other democratic countries,See, for example, J Lobel, 'The Limits of Constitutional Power: Conflicts between Foreign Policy and International Law' (1985) 71(7) Virginia Law Review 1071. J Habermas, 'The Constitutionalization of International Law and the Legitimation Problems of a Constitution for World Society' (2008) 15(4) Constellations 444. In Germany, see Grundgesetz 1949 art 25, \\"The general rules of international law shall be an integral part of federal law. They shall take precedence over the laws and directly create rights and duties for the inhabitants of the federal territory.\\" In the EU, see Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council and Commission (2008) C-402/05, holding that international law binds EU law unless it requires an act that would run contrary to basic human rights. the principles of international law are a basic component of the UK constitution, both as a primary tool of interpretation of domestic law, and through the UK's consistent support and membership of major international organisations. As far back as the Magna Carta 1215, English law recognised the right to free movement of people for international trade.e.g. Magna Carta 1215, ch 41, 'All merchants shall have safe and secure exit from England, and entry to England, with the right to tarry there and to move about as well by land as by water, for buying and selling by the ancient and right customs, quit from all evil tolls, except (in time of war) such merchants as are of the land at war with us...‚Äô By 1608, Sir Edward Coke wrote confidently that international commercial law, or the lex mercatoria, is part of the laws of the realm,Coke, 1 Institutes 182 while the constitutional crises of the 17th century centred upon Parliament halting the King's attempting to tax international trade without its consent.See Bate's case or Case of Impositions (1606) 2 St Tr 371, John Bate claimed he did not need to pay a duty on imported currants imposed by the Crown, as contrary to the Confirmation of Charters, Weirs, Taxation Act 1371, 45 Edw 3 c 4, which prohibited indirect taxation without consent of Parliament. The Court of Exchequer held the Crown could impose the duty as he pleased to regulate trade. The Court could not go behind the King's statement that the duty was indeed imposed for the purpose of regulating trade. Then, the Case of Ship Money or R v Hampden (1637) 3 St Tr 825 held that the King could raise money from trade without Parliament. This was reversed by the Shipmoney Act 1640, and after the civil war and glorious revolution, once again by the Bill of Rights 1689 art 4. Similarly in the 18th century, Lord Holt CJ viewed international law as a general tool for interpretation of the common law,Lethulier's Case (1692) 2 Salk 443, \\"we take notice of the laws of merchants that are general, not of those that are particular.\\" while Lord Mansfield in particular did more than any other to affirm that the international lex mercatoria \\"is not the law of a particular country but the law of all nations\\",Luke v Lyde (1759) 97 Eng Rep 614, 618; (1759) 2 Burr 882, 887 and \\"the law of merchants and the law of the land is the same\\".Pillans v Van Mierop (1765) 3 Burr 1663 In 1774, in Somerset v Stewart, one of the most important cases in legal history, Lord Mansfield held that slavery was lawful \\"in no country\\" and therefore in common law.Somerset v Stewart (1772) 98 ER 499, \\"The state of slavery is of such a nature, that it is incapable of now being introduced by Courts of Justice upon mere reasoning or inferences from any principles, natural or political; it must take its rise from positive law; the origin of it can in no country or age be traced back to any other source: immemorial usage preserves the memory of positive law long after all traces of the occasion; reason, authority, and time of its introduction are lost...\\" In modern case law it has been consistently accepted that it \\"is a principle of legal policy that [UK] law should conform to public international law.\\"Saad v SS for the Home Department [2001] EWCA Civ 2008, [15] Lord Phillips MR, quoting Bennion on Statutory Interpretation (3rd ed) p 630 that: \\"It is a principle of legal policy that the municipal law should conform to public international law. The court, when considering, in relation to the facts of the instant case, which of the opposing constructions of the enactment would give effect to the legislative intention, should presume that the legislator intended to observe this principle.\\" The House of Lords stressed that \\"there is a strong presumption in favour of interpreting English law (whether common law or statute) in a way which does not place the United Kingdom in breach of an international obligation.\\"R v Lyons [2002] UKHL 44, [27] Lord Hoffmann For example, in Hounga v Allen the Supreme Court held that a young lady who had been illegally trafficked to the UK had a right to bring a race discrimination claim against her employers, even though she had herself been in violation of the Immigration Act 1971.[2014] UKSC 47 In doing so, the court unanimously drew upon international treaties signed by the UK, known as the Palermo Protocols, as well as the European Convention on Human Rights, in interpreting the scope of the common law doctrine of illegality, and held it was no bar for the claimant to assert her legal rights. It has been further debated whether the UK should adopt a theory of that sees international law as part of UK without any further act (a \\"monist\\" theory), or whether it should still be required for international law principles to be translated into domestic law (a \\"dualist\\" theory).See further R (SG) v SS for Work and Pensions [2015] UKSC 16, on the benefits cap, Lord Kerr, dissenting, at [247]-[257] argued the dualist theory of international law should be abandoned, and international law should be directly effective in UK law. The current position in European Union law is that while international law binds the EU, it cannot undermine fundamental principles of constitutional law or human rights.Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council and Commission (2008) C-402/05 In the Brexit referendum 52% voted to leave the European Union, and 48% to remain. Critics have filed complaints about the substantiality of the question.Presumed violations of international law and common law standards of free and fair voting; see the Venice Commission, Code of Practice on Referendums (2007) on asking questions with concrete, determinative choices. Since the World Wars brought an end to the British Empire and physically destroyed large parts of the country, the UK has consistently supported organisations formed under international law. From the Versailles Treaty 1919, the UK was a founding member of the International Labour Organization, which sets universal standards for people's rights at work. After the failure of the League of Nations and following World War Two, the UK became a founding member of the United Nations, recognised by Parliament through the United Nations Act 1946, enabling any resolution of the Security Council except the use of force to be implemented by an Order in Council. Under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948, the compulsory colonial occupation, scarcity of democracy and difformity of human rights in the British Empire lost substantial legitimacy under international law, and combined with independence movements this led to its rapid dissolution. Two fundamental treaties, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 1966 saw the UK ratify most rights from the Universal Declaration. Following the Ponsonby Rule from 1924, the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 section 20 stipulates that a treaty is ratified once it is laid before Parliament for 21 days and no adverse resolution is passed against it.For principles of treaty interpretation, see the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 Regionally, the UK participated in drafting the European Convention on Human Rights 1950 which sought to guarantee basic standards of democracy and human rights to preserve peace in post-war Europe. At the same time, following long- held visions for European integration with the UK \\"at the centre\\",e.g. Winston Churchill, 'Speech to the 69th Annual Conservative Party Conference at Llandudno' (9 October 1948). See J Danzig 'Winston Churchill: A founder of the European Union' (10 November 2013) EU ROPE democratic European countries sought to integrate their economies both to make war vain, and to advance social progress. In 1972, the UK joined the European Community (renamed the European Union in 1992) and committed to implement EU law in which it participated, in the European Communities Act 1972. In 1995, the UK also became a founding member of the World Trade Organization.cf World Trade Organization (Immunities and Privileges) Order 1995 To ensure that the European Convention was directly applied by the courts, the Human Rights Act 1998 was passed. Parrliament also passed the International Criminal Court Act 2001 to enable prosecution of war criminals, and subjected itself to the jurisdiction of the court. In 2016 the UK voted in a referendum on whether to leave the European Union, resulting‚Äîwith a 72.2% turnout‚Äîin a margin of 51.9% favouring \\"leave\\" and 48.1% favouring \\"remain\\".On the post-referendum debate, see R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union [2017] UKSC 5 and European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017 s 1, giving power to the PM to notify intention to negotiate to leave the EU. Nonetheless, considerable majorities in both Scotland and Northern Ireland favoured remaining in the EU, in a climate of allegations of significant misconduct taking place in the campaigns.See House of Commons, Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Disinformation and 'fake news': Interim Report (29 July 2018) HC 363 and Electoral Commission, Report of an investigation in respect of Vote Leave Limited, Mr Darren Grimes, BeLeave, Veterans for Britain (17 July 2018).

Institutions The UK system of parliamentary democracy ensures that the executive, and the Prime Minister, is removable by a simple majority vote in the House of Commons. The executive is bound to the rule of law, interpreted by the judiciary, but the judiciary may not declare an Act of Parliament to be unconstitutional. While principles may the basis of the UK constitution, the institutions of the state perform its functions in practice. First, Parliament is the sovereign entity. Its two chambers legislate. In the House of Commons each Member of Parliament is elected by a simple majority in a democratic vote, although outcomes do not always accurately match people's preferences overall. Historically, most elections occurred each four years,The Parliament Act 1911 set elections to take place at a maximum of each five years, but elections usually occurred in a fourth year. Before this the maximum was seven years, but in practice governments called votes sooner. but this was fixed at five years in 2011.Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 s 1(3). By contrast, Australia has elections each 3 years, and the US has presidential elections each 4 years. Election spending is tightly controlled, foreign interference is prohibited, and donations and lobbying are limited in whatever form. The House of Lords reviews and votes upon legislative proposals by the Commons. It can delay legislation by one year, and cannot delay at all if the proposed Act concerns money.Parliament Act 1911 and Parliament Act 1949. Most Lords are appointed by the Prime Minister, through the Queen,Life Peerages Act 1958 s 1 on the advice of a Commission which, by convention, offers some balance between political parties. Ninety-two hereditary peers remain.House of Lords Act 1999 ss 1-2, or 90 plus the \\"Lord Great Chamberlain\\" and the \\"Earl Marshal\\". To become law, each Act of Parliament must be read by both houses three times, and given royal assent by the monarch. The Sovereign does not veto legislation, by convention, since 1708. Second, the judiciary interprets the law. It can not strike down an Act of Parliament, but the judiciary ensures that any law which may violate fundamental rights has to be clearly expressed, to force politicians to openly confront what they are doing and \\"accept the political cost\\".R (Simms) v SS for the Home Department [1999] UKHL 33, [2000] 2 AC 115, 131, Lord Hoffmann Under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, the judiciary is appointed by the Judicial Appointments Commission with cross-party and judicial recommendations, to protect judicial independence. Third, the executive branch of government is led by the Prime Minister who must be able to command a majority in the House of Commons. The Cabinet of Ministers is appointed by the Prime Minister to lead the main departments of state, such as the Treasury, the Foreign Office, the Department of Health and the Department of Education. Officially the \\"head of state\\" is the monarch, but all prerogative power is exercised by the Prime Minister, subject to judicial review. Fourth, as the UK matured as a modern democracy, an extensive system of civil servants, and public service institutions developed to deliver UK residents economic, social and legal rights. All public bodies, and private bodies that perform public functions, are bound by the rule of law. Parliament In the UK constitution, Parliament sits at the apex of power. It emerged through a series of revolutions as the dominant body, over the church, courts, and the monarch,Following Magna Carta 1215, see the Acts of Supremacy 1534, the Earl of Oxford's case (1615) 21 ER 485, and the Bill of Rights 1689 and within Parliament the House of Commons emerged as the dominant chamber, over the House of Lords that traditionally represented the aristocracy.This was represented by the Parliament Act 1911, following the People's Budget of 1909. The central justification for Parliamentary sovereignty is usually thought to be its democratic nature, although it was only upon the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 that Parliament could be said to have finally become \\"democratic\\" in any modern sense (as property qualifications to vote were abolished for everyone over 21), and not until after WW2 that decolonisation, university constituencies and lowering of the voting age took place. Parliament's main functions are to legislate, to allocate money for public spending,Bill of Rights 1689 art 4, levying money for the Crown without Parliament's consent is illegal. Each year a Supply and Appropriation (Anticipation and Adjustments) Bill, typically passed in March, provides money on account to fund activities from the start of the new financial year. A Supply and Appropriation (Main Estimates) Bill, typicalled passed in July, authorises issue of money from the Consolidated Fund for the balance of the grant of estimates for the financial year, with a detailed schedule of total net resources, capital and cash authorised for each department. and to scrutinise the government.See JS Mill, Considerations on Representative Government (1861) ch 5. AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2018) ch 8. In practice many MPs are involved in Parliamentary committees which investigate spending, policies, laws and their impact, and often report to recommend reform. For instance, the Modernisation Committee of the House of Commons in 2002 recommended publishing draft bills before they became law, and was later found to have been highly successful.HC Modernisation Committee (2001-2) HC 1168, recommended publishing draft bills, and (2005-6) HC 1097, 'one of the most successful Parliamentary innovations of the last ten years' and 'should become more widespread'. There are 650 Members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons, currently elected in five-year terms unless two-thirds vote for an early election,Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 s 1(3) and 790 peers in the House of Lords. For a proposed Bill to become an Act, and law, it must be read three times in each chamber, and given royal assent by the monarch. House of Commons is the most important body in the UK constitution. Its Members of Parliament are democratically elected by constituencies across the UK, and the parties who have a majority in the Commons form the UK government. Today, the House of Commons is the primary organ of representative government. Section 1 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 gives the right to all registered citizens of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and the Commonwealth aged 18 and over to elect Members of Parliament to the House of Commons. Sections 3 and 4 exclude people who are convicted of an offence and in a penal institution, or detained under mental health laws.Mental Health Act 1983 or Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964 These restrictions fall below European standards, which require that people who are convicted of very minor crimes (such as petty theft or drug offences) have the right to vote.See Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2) [2005] ECHR 681 (blanket disqualification of convicted prisoners from voting breached ECHR Prot 1, art 3. After this the UK failed to change its laws. Green v United Kingdom [2010] ECHR 868 reaffirmed the position. HL Paper 103, HC 924 (2013-14) recommended prisoners serving under 12 months should be entitled to vote. Parliament still did not act. McHugh v UK [2015] ECHR 155, reaffirmed breach but awarded no compensation or costs.However, Moohan v Lord Advocate [2014] UKSC 67 and Moohan v UK (13 June 2017) App No 22962/15, denial of prisoner voting in the Scottish independent referendum was not a breach of art 3. Since 2013, everyone has to register individually to vote (for instance, at www.gov.uk/register-to-vote), instead of households being able to register collectively, but an annual household canvass is conducted to increase the number of registered people.Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013 ss 1-5 As far back as 1703, Ashby v White recognised the right to \\"vote at the election of a person to represent him or [her] in Parliament, there to concur to the making of laws, which are to bind his liberty and property\\" as \\"a most transcendent thing, and of an high nature\\".(1703) 2 Ld Raym 938 This originally meant that any interference in that right would lead to damages. If the denial of voting would have changed the result, or if a vote was \\"conducted so badly that it was not substantially in accordance with the law\\" the vote would have to be run again.Morgan v Simpson [1975] QB 151, per Lord Denning MR So, in Morgan v Simpson the Court of Appeal declared that an election for a Greater London Council seat was not valid after it was found that 44 unstamped ballot papers were not counted. These common law principles predate statutory regulation, and therefore appear to apply to any vote, including elections and referendums.cf R (Wilson) v Prime Minister [2018] EWHC 3520 (Admin), and E McGaughey, 'Could Brexit be Void?' (2018) King's Law Journal Election spending is tightly controlled today by statute. A maximum of ¬£20 million can be spent by political parties in national campaigns, plus ¬£10,000 in each constituency.PPERA 2000 ss 72-131 and Schs 8-13, in referendums, the limit has traditionally been set at ¬£600,000 for the official campaigns on each side. Political advertisements on television are prohibited except for those in certain free time slots,Communications Act 2003 ss 319-333. although the internet remains largely unregulated. Any spending over ¬£500 by third parties must be disclosed. While these rules are strict, they were held in Animal Defenders International v UK to be compatible with the Convention because \\"each person has equal value\\" and \\"we do not want our government or its policies to be decided by the highest spenders.\\"Animal Defenders International v United Kingdom [2008] UKHL 15, [48] per Baroness Hale. Confirmed in [2013] ECHR 362. Foreign interference in voting is completely prohibited, including any \\"broadcasting\\" (also over the internet) \\"with intent to influence persons to give or refrain from giving their votes\\".Representation of the People Act 1983 ss 92. Furthermore, any \\"trading\\" with hostile foreign parties with whom the UK is \\"at war\\" may lead to seven years in prison. Trading with the Enemy Act 1939 (c 89) ss 1-2, seven years prison for trading with an enemy who is \\"at war with His majesty\\". Donations by foreign parties can be forfeited in their entirety to the Electoral Commission.R (Electoral Commission) v City of Westminster Magistrate's Court and UKIP [2010] UKSC 40, holding that a partial forfeiture of ¬£349,216 donations by a non-UK resident was appropriate. Domestic donations are limited to registered parties, and must be reported, when they are over ¬£7,500 nationally or ¬£1,500 locally, to the Electoral Commission.Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 ss 12-69 and 149 The system for electing the Commons is based on constituencies, whose boundaries are periodically reviewed to even out populations.Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986, setting up the Boundary Commission. See also, R (McWhirter) v Home Secretary (21 October 1969) The Times, elector in Enfield sought mandamus ('we command') to require Home Secretary to perform statutory duty of laying before Parliament Commission reports with draft orders in Council. There has been considerable debate about the first-past-the-post system of voting the UK uses, as it tends to exclude minority parties. By contrast, in Australia voters may select preferences for candidates, although this system was rejected in a 2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum staged by the Cameron-Clegg coalition. In the European Parliament, voters choose a party from multi-member regional constituencies: this tends to give smaller parties much greater representation. In the Scottish Parliament, the Senedd and London Assembly, voters have the choice of both constituencies and a party list, which tends to reflect overall preferences best. To be elected as an MP, most people generally become members of political parties, and must be over 18 on the day of nomination to run for a seat,Electoral Administration Act 2006 s 17 be a qualifying Commonwealth or Irish citizen,Act of Settlement 1700 s 3 unless 'qualifying Commonwealth and Irish citizens, British Nationality Act 1981 Sch 7 and Electoral Administration Act 2006 s 18 not be bankrupt,Insolvency Act 1986 s 426A(5) found guilty of corrupt practices,RPA 1983 ss 160 and 173 or be a Lord, judge or employee of the civil service.House of Commons Disqualification Act 1957 ss 1 and 5 and House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 give further exceptions. To limit the government's practical control over Parliament, the Ministerial and Other Salaries Act 1975 restricts higher payment of salaries to a set number of MPs.Ministerial and Other Salaries Act 1975 ss 1-2 The House of Lords is a chamber mostly appointed by the Prime Minister, loosely based on the Lords' expertise, achievement, or political affiliation. Since the abolition of most hereditary peers, there has been ongoing debate about whether or how to elect the House of Lords. Along with a hereditary monarch, the House of Lords remains an historical curiosity in the UK constitution. Traditionally it represented the landed aristocracy, and political allies of the monarch or the government, and has only gradually and incompletely been reformed. Today, the House of Lords Act 1999 has abolished all but 92 hereditary peers, leaving most peers to be \\"life peers\\" appointed by the government under the Life Peerages Act 1958, law lords appointed under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876, and Lords Spiritual who are senior clergy of the Church of England.House of Lords Act 1999 ss 1-2 Since 2005, senior judges can only sit and vote in the House of Lords after retirement.Constitutional Reform Act 2005 s 24 The government carries out appointment of most peers, but since 2000 has taken advice from a seven-person House of Lords Appointments Commission with representatives from the Labour, Conservatives and Liberal-Democrat parties.See the Lords Appointments webpage. A peerage can always be disclaimed,Now confirmed in the House of Lords Reform Act 2014 and ex-peers may then run for Parliament.Peerages Act 1963 and Re Parliamentary Election for Bristol South East [1964] 2 QB 257, Viscount Stansgate or Tony Benn challenged the law disqualifying peers standing for Parliament. Since 2015, a peer may be suspended or expelled by the House.House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015 In practice the Parliament Act 1949 greatly reduced the House of Lords' power, as it can only delay and cannot block legislation by one year, and cannot delay money bills at all.Parliament Act 1911 ss 1-3 and Parliament Act 1949 Nevertheless, several options for reform are debated. A House of Lords Reform Bill 2012 proposed to have 360 directly elected members, 90 appointed members, 12 bishops and an uncertain number of ministerial members. The elected Lords would have been elected by proportional representation for 15-year terms, through 10 regional constituencies on a single transferable vote system. However, the government withdrew support after backlash from Conservative backbenches. It has often been argued that if the Lords were elected by geographic constituencies and a party controlled both sides \\"there would be little prospect of effective scrutiny or revision of government business.\\" A second option, like in Swedish Riksdag, could simply be to abolish the House of Lords: this was in fact done during the English Civil War in 1649, but restored along with the monarchy in 1660.An Act abolishing the House of Lords 1649, reading \\"The Commons of England assembled in Parliament, finding by too long experience that the House of Lords is useless and dangerous to the people of England to be continued, have thought fit to ordain and enact, and be it ordained and enacted by this present Parliament, and by the authority of the same, that from henceforth the House of Lords in Parliament shall be and is hereby wholly abolished and taken away; and that the Lords shall not from henceforth meet or sit in the said House called the Lords' House, or in any other house or place whatsoever...\\" See also T Benn, 'We should abolish the House of Lords, not reform it' (12 July 2012) New Statesman A third proposed option is to elect peers by work and professional groups, so that health care workers elect peers with special health knowledge, people in education elect a fixed number of education experts, legal professionals elect legal representatives, and so on.cf GDH Cole, Self-Government in Industry (5th edn 1920) ch V, 134-135. S Webb, Reform of the House of Lords (1917) Fabian Tract No. 183, 7, at 12, preferring a chamber of around 100 people elected by proportional representation. E McGaughey, 'A Twelve Point Plan for Labour, and A Manifesto for Labour Law' (2017) 46(1) Industrial Law Journal 169 This is argued to be necessary to improve the quality of legislation. Judiciary Proceedings in the UK Supreme Court, which moved to its modern home at Middlesex Guildhall in 2009, are web-streamed live, and judges no longer wear wigs. The judiciary in the United Kingdom has the essential functions of upholding the rule of law, democracy, and human rights. The highest court of appeal, renamed from the House of Lords officially from 2005, is the UK Supreme Court; with the Lord Chancellor's role changed dramatically on 3 April 2006, as a result of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. Due to the Constitutional Reform Act of 2005, the make up of the Judiciary is clearly demonstrated for the first time inside the Constitution. This form of enshrined law presents a new branch of government. An independent Supreme Court has been established, separate from the House of Lords and with its own independent appointments system, staff, budget and building. Further aspects of this explores how independent Judicial has become; Appointments Commission, responsible for selecting candidates to recommend for judicial appointment to the Secretary of State for Justice were established. The Judicial Appointments Commission ensures that merit remains the sole criterion for appointment and the appointments system is modern, open and transparent. Lastly,in terms of scrutiny, A Judicial Appointment and Conduct Ombudsman, responsible for investigating and making recommendations concerning complaints about the judicial appointments process, and the handling of judicial conduct complaints within the scope of the Constitutional Reform Act, this provides checks and balances to the Supreme Court.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/4/contents The Judiciary hears appeals from the whole UK in civil law matters, and for criminal law in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland. It cannot hear criminal appeals from Scotland, as that was precluded by the 1707 Treaty of Union, and it is outside the formal competence of the UK Parliament to alter that position. The Supreme Court does however consider \\"devolution issues\\" where these may affect Scottish criminal law. Since the 1966 Practice Statement, the judiciary has acknowledged that while a system of precedent, that binds lower courts, is necessary to provide \\"at least some degree of certainty\\", the courts should update their jurisprudence and \\"depart from a previous decision when it appears right to do so.\\"Practice Statement [1966] 3 All ER 77 Litigation usually begins in a County Court or the High Court for civil law issues,This has three divisions: the Administrative, Family and Queen's Bench divisions. or a magistrates' court or the Crown Court for criminal law issues. There are also employment tribunals for labour law disputes,Employment Tribunals Act 1996, appealing to the Employment Appeal Tribunal. and the First-tier Tribunal for public or regulatory disputes, ranging from immigration, to social security, to tax.Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, appealing to the appropriate Upper Tribunal division. After the High Court, Crown Court, or appeal tribunals, cases generally may appeal to the Court of Appeal in England and Wales. In Scotland, the Court of Session has an Outer (first instance) and Inner (appeal) House. Appeals then go to the UK Supreme Court, although at any time a court may make a \\"preliminary reference\\" to the Court of Justice of the European Union to clarify the meaning of EU law. Since the Human Rights Act 1998, courts have been expressly required to interpret UK law to be compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. This follows a longer tradition of courts interpreting the law to be compatible with international law obligations.e.g. Hounga v Allen [2014] UKSC 47 It is generally accepted that the UK courts do not merely apply but also create new law through their interpretative function: this is obvious in the common law and equity, where there is no codified statutory basis for large parts of the law, such as contracts, torts or trusts. This also means an element of retroactivity,\\"The power to interpret is the power to destroy.\\" O Kahn-Freund, 'The Impact of Constitutions on Labour Law\\" (1976) 35 Cambridge Law Journal 240, 244, paraphrasing Marshall CJ in McCulloch v Maryland (1819) 17 US (4 Wheat) 316 since an application of developing rules may differ from at least one party's understanding of the law in any conflict.See Re Spectrum Plus Ltd [2005] UKHL 41. Although formally the UK judiciary may not declare an Act of Parliament \\"unconstitutional\\",See Pickin v British Railways Board [1974] AC 765 in practice the judiciary's power to interpret the law so as to be compatible with human rights can render a statute inoperative, much like in other countries.R (Simms) v SS for the Home Department [1999] UKHL 33, per Lord Hoffmann, \\"In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.\\" The courts do so sparingly because they recognise the importance of the democratic process. Judges may also sit from time to time on public inquiries.Inquiries Act 2005 The UK Supreme Court on Parliament Square. The independence of the judiciary is one of the cornerstones of the constitution, and means in practice that judges cannot be dismissed from office. Since the Act of Settlement 1700, no judge has been removed, as to do so the Queen must act on address by both Houses of Parliament.See now the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 s 33 and Senior Courts Act 1981 s 11(3) It is very likely that a judge would never be dismissed, not merely because of formal rules but a \\"shared constitutional understanding\\" of the importance of the integrity of the legal system.AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2014) 329, 'whatever the theoretical position, there are a number of reasons which help to ensure that these latter powers are unlikely ever to be used, with the security of judicial tenure relying not so much on legal rules as on a shared constitutional understanding which these rules reflect.' This is reflected, for example, in the sub judice rule that matters awaiting decision in court should not be prejudged in a Parliamentary debate.Codified in 1963, updated in 1972 and 2001, HC Deb (15 December 2001) col 1012. The Lord Chancellor (once head of the judiciary but now simply a government minister) also has a statutory duty to uphold the independence of the judiciary,Constitutional Reform Act 2005 s 3 for instance, against attacks upon their integrity by media, corporations, or the government itself. Members of the judiciary can be appointed from among any member of the legal profession who has over 10 years of experience having rights of audience before a court: this usually includes barristers, but can also mean solicitors or academics.Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 Appointments should be made \\"solely on merit\\" but regard may be had to the need for diversity when two candidates have equal qualifications.This was not always true: H Laski (1932) 168-9, between 1832 and 1906, 'Out of 139 judges appointed, 80 were members of the House of Commons at the time of their nomination; 11 others had been candidates for Parliament', and that of the 80, '63 were appointed by their own party while in office'. For appointments to the Supreme Court, a five-member Judicial Appointments Committee is formed including one Supreme Court judge, three members from the Judicial Appointments Commission, and one lay person.CRA 2005 s 27A and SI 2013/2193. See also Judicial Appointments Regulations 2013 (SI 2192) For other senior judges such as those on the Court of Appeal, or for the Lord Chief Justice, Master of the Rolls, or the heads of the High Court divisions, a similar five member panel with two judges is formed.CRA 2005 ss 70-79 Gender and ethnic diversity is lacking in the UK judiciary compared to other developed countries, and potentially compromises the expertise and administration of justice.cf 'Baroness Brenda Hale: \\"I often ask myself 'why am I here?'\\" (17 September 2010) Guardian \\"I'm quite embarrassed to be the only justice to tick a lot of the diversity boxes, for example the gender one, the subject areas in which I'm interested (which are not ones that most of my colleagues have had much to do with up until now), the fact that I went to a non-fee-paying school and the fact that I wasn't a practitioner for any great length of time. I'm different from most of my colleagues in a number of respects (and they're probably at least as conscious of this as I am). I think we could do with more of that sort of diversity.\\" Backing up the judiciary is a considerable body of administrative law. The Contempt of Court Act 1981 enables a court to hold anyone in contempt, and commit the person to imprisonment, for violating a court order, or behaviour that could compromise a fair judicial process. In practice this is enforced by the executive. The Lord Chancellor heads the Ministry of Justice, which performs various functions including administering the Legal Aid Agency for people who cannot afford access to the courts. In R (UNISON) v Lord Chancellor the government suffered scathing criticism for creating high fees that cut the number of applicants to employment tribunals by 70 per cent.[2017] UKSC 51 The Attorney General of England and Wales, and in Scottish matters, the Advocate General for Scotland, and the Solicitor General for England and Wales represent the Crown in litigation. The Attorney General also appoints the Director of Public Prosecutions who heads the Crown Prosecution Service, which reviews cases submitted by the police for prosecution, and conducts them on behalf of the Crown.See the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 Executive The Prime Minister, at 10 Downing Street, exercises political power of the UK government, when they command majority support of the House of Commons. The executive branch, while subservient to Parliament and judicial oversight, exercises day to day power of the UK government. The UK remains a constitutional monarchy. The formal head of state is Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, a hereditary monarch since 1952. In reality, no Queen or King has attempted to usurp the will of Parliament since 1708,Queen Anne withheld royal assent for the Scottish Militia Bill. and all constitutional duties and power are accepted by binding convention to have shifted to the Prime Minister, Parliament or the courts.See R Blackburn, 'Monarchy and the personal prerogatives' [2004] Public Law 546, explaining that the \\"personal prerogative\\" of the monarch is a set of powers that must be exercised according to law, and must follow the advice of the Prime Minister, or in accordance with Parliament and the courts. Over the 17th century, the Petition of Right 1628 was asserted by Parliament to prevent any taxation by the monarch without Parliament's consent, and the Habeas Corpus Act 1640 denied the monarch any power to arrest people for failing to pay taxes. The monarch's continued assertion of the divine right to rule led to Charles I being executed in the English Civil War, and finally the settlement of power in the Bill of Rights of 1689. Following the Act of Union 1707 and an early financial crisis as South Sea Company shares crashed, Robert Walpole emerged as a dominant political figure. Leading the House of Commons from 1721 to 1742, Walpole is generally acknowledged to be the first Prime Minister (Primus inter pares). The PM's modern functions include leading the dominant political party, setting policy priorities, creating Ministries and appointing ministers, judges, peers, and civil servants. The PM also has considerable control through the convention of collective responsibility (that ministers must publicly support the government even when they privately disagree, or resign), and control over the government's communications to the public. By contrast in law, as is necessary in a democratic society,n.b. the Monarch continued to withhold royal assent for laws in British colonies leading, for example, to the American Revolution and US Declaration of Independence in 1776. the monarch is a figurehead with no political power,cf W Bagehot, The English Constitution (1867) 111, suggesting the monarch has a right to be consulted, to encourage and to warn. but a series of ceremonial duties, and considerable funding. Aside from private wealth and finance,The Sunday Times Rich List 2015 estimated the Queen's personal wealth at ¬£340 million, making her the 302nd richest person in the UK: H Nianias, 'The Queen drops off the top end of the Sunday Times Rich List for the first time since its inception' (26 April 2015) The Independent the monarchy is funded under the Sovereign Grant Act 2011, which reserves 25 per cent of the net revenue from the Crown Estate.Sovereign Grant Act 2011 ss 1-6. This was raised from 15% by SI 2017/438 art 2. The Crown Estate is a public, government corporation,Crown Estate Act 1961 s 1, up to eight Crown Estate Commissioners are appointed by the monarch on PM advice. which in 2015 held ¬£12 billion in investments, mostly land and property, and therefore generates income by charging rent to businesses or people for homes.'Crown Estate makes record ¬£304m Treasury payout' (28 June 2016) BBC News. See map.whoownsengland.org and the colour purple for the Crown Estate. This includes (1) retail property such as Regent Street in London, commercial property in Oxford, Milton Keynes, Nottingham, Newcastle, etc., and a right to receive 23% of the income from the Duchy of Lancaster's Savoy Estate in London (2) 116,000 hectares of agricultural land and forests, together with minerals and residential and commercial property (3) rights to extract minerals covers some 115,500 hectares (4) 55% of the UK's foreshore, and all of the UK's seabed from mean low water to the 12-nautical-mile (22 km) limit, plus sovereign rights of the UK in the seabed and its resources vested by the Continental Shelf Act 1964. The monarch's major ceremonial duties are to appoint the Prime Minister who can command the majority of the House of Commons,I Jennings, Cabinet Government (3rd edn 1959) ch 2 to give royal assent to Acts of Parliament, and to dissolve Parliament upon the calling of an election.Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 Minor ceremonial duties include giving an audience to the Prime Minister, as well as visiting ministers or diplomats from the Commonwealth, and acting on state occasions, such as delivering the \\"Queen's speech\\" (written by the government, outlining its political platform) at the opening of Parliament. Public support for the monarchy remains high, with only 21% of the population preferring a republic instead. However, on the other hand, it has been argued that the UK should abolish the monarchy, on the ground that hereditary inheritance of political office has no place in a modern democracy. A referendum was held in Australia, in 1999 on becoming a Republic, but failed to get a majority.The vote was 45.13% in favour of becoming a republic, but on a model of having a directly elected president. 54..87% of voters opposed this. See [2000] Public Law 3. official opposition, currently led by Sir Keir Starmer of the Labour Party, is to hold the government and the Prime Minister to account in and out of Parliament. Although called the royal prerogative, a series of important powers that were once vested in the King or Queen are now exercised by government, and the Prime Minister in particular. These are powers of day-to- day management, but tightly constrained to ensure that executive power cannot usurp Parliament or the courts. In the Case of Prohibitions in 1607,Case of Prohibitions [1607] EWHC J23 (KB), per Coke CJ, \\"true it was, that God had endowed His Majesty with excellent science, and great endowments of nature; but His Majesty was not learned in the laws of his realm of England, and causes which concern the life, or inheritance, or goods, or fortunes of his subjects\\". it was held that the royal prerogative could not be used to determine court cases, and in the Case of Proclamations in 1610 it was held new prerogative powers could not be created by the executive.Case of Proclamations [1610] EWHC KB J22 It is also clear that no exercise of the prerogative can compromise any right contained in an Act of Parliament. So, for instance, in R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the EU the Supreme Court held that the Prime Minister could not notify the European Commission of an intention to leave under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union without an Act of Parliament, because it could result in rights being withdrawn that were granted under the European Communities Act 1972, such as the right to work in other EU member states or vote in European Parliament elections.R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the EU [2017] UKSC 5 Though royal prerogative powers can be categorised in different ways,cf AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2018) ch 10 258-265, listing 9 categories. there are around 15.HC Deb (21 April 1993) col 490 and HC 422 (2003-4) Treasury Solicitor, suggesting an exhaustive catalogue of powers is probably not possible, but listing major categories. First, the executive may create hereditary titles, confer honours and create peers.Subject to the Life Peerages Act 1958 and House of Lords Act 1999 s 1 Second, the executive can legislate by an Order in Council, though this has been called an 'anachronistic survival'.See R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex p Bancoult (No 2) [2008] UKHL 61, [69] per Lord Bingham Third, the executive can create and administer financial benefits schemes.R (Lain) v Criminal Injuries Compensation Board [1967] 2 QB 864, 886. R (Harrison) v Home Secretary [1988] 3 All ER 86. R (FBU) v Home Secretary [1995] 2 AC 513, Re Lord Bishop of Natal (1864) 3 Moo PC (NS) 115 Fourth, through the Attorney General the executive can stop prosecutions or pardon convicted offenders after taking advice.Allen (1862) 1 B&S; 850 and Criminal Appeal Act 1995 s 16 Fifth, the executive may acquire more territory or alter limits of British territorial waters.e.g. the Island of Rockall was seized in 1955, and later recognised in the Island of Rockall Act 1972. See R (Lye) v Kent JJ [1967] 2 QB 153 on alterations. Sixth, the executive may expel aliens and theoretically restrain people from leaving the UK.Nissan v AG [1970] AC 179, now regulated by Immigration Act 1971 s 33(5). The power of expulsion is considered 'doubtful' outside statute: AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2018) ch 10, 261 Seventh, the executive can sign treaties, although before it is considered ratified the treaty must be laid before Parliament for 21 days and there must be no resolution against it.Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 s 20, codifying the previous Ponsonby Rule. Eighth, the executive governs the armed forces and can do \\"all those things in an emergency which are necessary for the conduct of war\\".Burmah Oil Co Ltd v Lord Advocate [1965] AC 75, 101 The executive cannot declare war without Parliament by convention, and in any case has no hope in funding war without Parliament.This convention was established through the Iraq war, where Parliament backed an invasion contrary to international law in 2003, and a vote against an invasion of Syria in 2013. Ninth, the Prime Minister can appoint ministers, judges, public officials or royal commissioners. Tenth, the monarch needs to pay no tax, unless statute states it expressly.Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart NV v Administrator of Hungarian Property [1954] AC 584 Eleventh, the executive may by royal charter create corporations, such as the BBC,e.g. MoJ, Rev of the Exec Royal Prer Powers (2009) 23 and franchises for markets, ferries and fisheries.Spook Erection Ltd v Environment Secretary [1989] QB 300 (beneficiary of market franchise not entitled to Crown's exemption from planning control) Twelfth, the executive has the right to mine precious metals, and to take treasure troves. Thirteenth, it may make coins. Fourteenth, it can print or license the authorised version of the Bible, Book of Common Prayer and state papers. And fifteenth, subject to modern family law, it may take guardianship of infants.e.g. Butler v Freeman (1756) Amb 302, In re a Local Authority [2003] EWHC 2746, Scott v Scott [1913] AC 417. In addition to these royal prerogative powers, there are innumerable powers explicitly laid down in statutes enabling the executive to make legal changes. This includes a growing number of Henry VIII clauses, which enable a Secretary of State to alter provisions of primary legislation. For this reason it has often been argued that executive authority should be reduced, written into statute, and never used to deprive people of rights without Parliament. All uses of the prerogative, however, are subject to judicial review: in the GCHQ case the House of Lords held that no person could be deprived of legitimate expectations by use of the royal prerogative.Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service [1985] AC 374 Whitehall hosts the major offices of the UK government, led by cabinet ministers. Facing towards Big Ben is a statue of Charles I, who was executed in 1649 following the English Civil War. Although the Prime Minister is the head of Parliament, Her Majesty's Government is formed by a larger group of Members of Parliament, or peers. The \\"cabinet\\" is a still smaller group of 22 or 23 people, though only twenty ministers may be paid.Ministerial Salaries Act 1975. See also, recognising the PM's position, the Chequers Estate Act 1917, Chevening Estate Act 1959, Ministerial and other Pensions and Salaries Act 1991 Each minister typically heads a Department or Ministry, which can be created or renamed by prerogative.Ministers of the Crown Act 1975 s 5. Under the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 s 17 the Minister for Civil Service (i.e. the PM) maintains a list of govt departments (for the purpose of proceedings against the Crown). Cabinet committees are usually organised by the Prime Minister. Every minister is expected to follow collective responsibility,See AG v Jonathan Cape Ltd [1976] QB 752, suggesting the duty of confidentiality expires after a number of years out of government. and the Ministerial Code 2010. This includes rules that Ministers are \\"expected to behave in a way that upholds the highest standards of propriety\\", \\"give accurate and truthful information to Parliament\\", resign if they \\"knowingly mislead Parliament\\", to be \\"as open as possible\\", have no possible conflicts of interest and give a full list of interests to a permanent secretary, and only \\"remain in office for so long as they retain the confidence of the Prime Minister\\". Assisting ministers is a modern civil service and network of government bodies, who are employed at the pleasure of the Crown.Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 s 3, putting management of the civil service into statute. Civil Service Management Code s 11.1.1, civil servants employed at pleasure of the Crown, theoretically lacking a wrongful dismissal remedy according to somewhat outdated case law: Dunn v R [1896] 1 QB 116 and Riordan v War Office [1959] 1 WLR 1046, but under the Employment Rights Act 1996 s 191, civil servants expressly have the right to claim unfair dismissal. The Civil Service Code requires civil servants to show \\"high standards of behaviour\\", uphold core values of \\"integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality\\", and never put themselves in a position that \\"might reasonably be seen to compromise their personal judgment or integrity\\".This is elaborated upon in a much larger Civil Service Management Code. See also the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906 and 1916. The Osmotherly Rules guide civil servants on how to answer questions from Parliament committees. Since the Freedom of Information Act 2000, it has been expected that government should be open about information, and should disclose it upon a request unless disclosure would compromise personal data, security or may run against the public interest.Freedom of Information Act 2000 ss 1 and 21-44. Sch 1 lists public bodies that are subject. The BBC can only be required to disclose information held for non-journalistic purposes, to protect freedom of expression: Sugar v BBC [2012] UKSC 4 and BBC v Information Commissioner [2009] UKHL 9 In this way the trend has been to more open, transparent and accountable governance. Regional government The Greater London Assembly and Mayor of London work at City Hall, London. The only region of England with representation, it has limited powers including over transport, the environment and housing.Greater London Authority Act 1999 ss 31, 141, 180 and 333 (with highly limited powers except in transport) The constitution of UK regional governments is an uncodified patchwork of authorities, mayors, councils and devolved government.See S Bailey, Cross on Local Government Law (2004). J Loughlin (ed), The Oxford Handbook of Local and Regional Democracy (2012). S Webb, English Local Government (1929) Volumes I‚ÄìX. In Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and London unified district or borough councils have local government powers, and since 1998 to 2006 new regional assemblies or Parliaments exercise extra powers devolved from Westminster. In England, there are 55 unitary authorities in the larger towns (e.g. Bristol, Brighton, Milton Keynes) and 36 metropolitan boroughs (surrounding Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, Sheffield, and Newcastle) which function as unitary local authorities. But in other parts of England, local government is split between two tiers of authority: 32 larger County Councils, and within those 192 District Councils, each sharing different functions. Since 1994, England has had eight regions for administrative purposes at Whitehall, yet these have no regional government or democratic assembly (like in London, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland) after a 2004 referendum on North East Assembly failed.In 2004, referendum in North East by postal ballot, 78% voted, rejecting a regional assembly of 25 to 35 members, elected by proportional representation. This means that England has among the most centralised, and disunified systems of governance in the Commonwealth and Europe. Three main issues in local government are the authorities' financing, their powers, and the reform of governance structures. First, councils raise revenue from council tax (charged on local residents according to property values in 1993Local Government Finance Act 1992 set up property value bands, but despite proposals in 1995, these have never been altered despite drastic shifts in house prices.) and business rates charged on businesses with operations in the locality. These powers are, compared to other countries, extreme in limiting local government autonomy, and taxes can be subjected to a local referendum if the Secretary of State determines they are excessive.Local Government Finance Act 1992 ss 52ZA-ZY, introduced by the Localism Act 2011. Also under ss 52A-Y in Wales the Secretary can cap council tax if deemed excessive. In real terms since 2010, central government cut local council funding by nearly 50 per cent, and real spending fell by 21 per cent, as councils failed to make up cuts through business rates.N Amin-Smith and D Phillips, 'English council funding: what's happened and what's next?' (2019) IFS, BN 250 Unitary authorities and district councils are responsible for administering council tax and business rates.See further Local Government Finance Act 1992 ss 65-68. Council Tax (Administration and Enforcement) Regulations 1992 regs 8-31 The duties of UK local governments are also extremely limited compared to other countries, but also uncodified so that in 2011 the Department for Communities and Local Government enumerated 1340 specific duties of local authorities.See DCLG duties and other duties. Generally, the Localism Act 2011 section 1 states local authorities may do anything an individual person may do, unless prohibited by law, but this provision has little effect because human beings or companies cannot tax or regulate other people in the way that governments must.Localism Act 2011 ss 1-5, which add that the Secretary of State can remove restrictions through secondary legislation. The Local Government Act 1972 section 101 says that a local authority can discharge its functions through a committee or any officer, and can transfer functions to another authority, while section 111 gives authorities the power to do any thing including spending or borrowing 'which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any of their functions'. However the real duties of local council are found in hundreds of scattered Acts and statutory instruments. These include duties to administer planning consent,Town and Country Planning Act 1990 ss 65-223 to carry out compulsory purchasing according to law,Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 ss 13-39 to administer school education,Education Act 1996 ss 3A-458 libraries,Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 ss 1-13 care for children,Childcare Act 2006 ss 6-13 roads or highway maintenance and local buses,Highways Act 1980 ss 25-31A provide care for the elderly and disabled,egNHS Act 2006 ss 74-82. NHS and Community Care Act 1990 ss 46-47. Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000 s 1-6A prevent pollution and ensure clean air,Environmental Protection Act 1990 ss 45-73A ensure collection, recycling and disposal of waste,e.g. Household Recycling Act 2003 regulate building standards,Building Act 1984 ss 59-106 provide social and affordable housing,e.g. Housing Act 1985 ss 8-43 and 166-8 and shelters for the homeless.Homelessness Act 2002 Local authorities do not yet have powers common in other countries, such as setting minimum wages, regulating rents, or borrowing and taxing as is necessary in the public interest, which frustrates objectives of pluralism, localism and autonomy.cf Widdicombe Committee, Committee of Inquiry into the Conduct of Local Authority Business (1986) Cmnd 9797 Since 2009, authorities have been empowered to merge into 'combined authorities' and to have an elected mayor.Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 s 107A and Sch 5A This has been done around Manchester, Sheffield, Liverpool, Newcastle, Leeds, Birmingham, the Tees Valley, Bristol and Peterborough. The functions of an elected mayor are not substantial, but can include those of Police and Crime Commissioners.Cities and Local Government Devolution Act 2016 s 15. cf M Elliot, Public Law (2016) 320, 'The net result, over time, will be a patchwork of combined authorities with elected mayors, supplying a mezzanine layer of government that sits between individual local authorities and central government.' HC 369 (2015-16) [53] criticised the lack of actual public consultation in creating combined authorities. See also 2012 English mayoral referendums and List of lord mayoralties and lord provostships in the United Kingdom. The Scottish Parliament at Holyrood has 129 MSPs with extensive powers, including taxation. In Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London there are also regional assemblies and Parliaments, similar to state or provincial governments in other countries. The extent of devolution differs in each place. The Scotland Act 1998 created a unicameral Scottish Parliament with 129 elected members each four years: 73 from single member constituencies with simple majority vote, and 56 from additional member systems of proportional representation. Under section 28, the Scottish Parliament can make any laws except for on 'reserved matters' listed in Schedule 5. These powers, reserved for the UK Parliament, include foreign affairs, defence, finance, economic planning, home affairs, trade and industry, social security, employment, broadcasting, and equal opportunities. By convention, members of the UK Parliament from Scottish constituencies do not vote on issues that the Scottish Parliament has exercised power over.cf Sir Kenneth Calman Report, Serving Scotland Better (2009) This is the most powerful regional government so far. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 lists which matters are transferred to the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Government of Wales Act 1998 created a 60-member national assembly with elections every four years, and set out twenty fields of government competence, with some exceptions. The fields include agriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development, economic development, education, environmental policy, health, highways and transport, housing, planning, and some aspects of social welfare.Government of Wales Act 1998 Sch 5 listing (1) agriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development) (2) ancient monuments and historic buildings (3) culture (4) economic development (5) education and training (6) environment (7) fire and rescue services and promotion of fire safety (8) food (9) health and health services (10) highways and transport (11) housing (12) local government (13) National Assembly for Wales (14) public administration (15) social welfare (16) sport and recreation (17) tourism (18) town and country planning (19) water and flood defence (20) Welsh language. The Supreme Court has tended to interpret these powers in favour of devolution.See Agricultural Sector (Wales) Bill - Reference by the Attorney General for England and Wales [2014] UKSC 43 Human rights Codification of human rights is recent, but before the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European Convention on Human Rights, UK law had one of the world's longest human rights traditions. The Magna Carta 1215 bound the King to require Parliament's consent before any tax, respect the right to a trial \\"by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land\\", stated that \\"We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right\\", guaranteed free movement for people, and preserved common land for everyone.Magna Carta 1215 clauses 12 (no tax without consent), 39 (fair trial), 40 (justice), 41 (free movement of merchants), and 47 (disafforesting common land). The Petition of Right 1628 reasserted these values from the Magna Carta against King Charles I. After the English Civil War the Bill of Rights 1689 in England and Wales, and the Claim of Rights Act 1689 in Scotland, enshrined principles of representative democracy, no tax without Parliament, freedom of speech in Parliament, and no \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\". By 1789, these ideas evolved and inspired both the US Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen after the American and French Revolutions. Although some labelled natural rights as \\"nonsense upon stilts\\",J Bentham, Anarchical Fallacies; Being an Examination of the Declarations of Rights Issued During the French Revolution (1789) art II more legal rights were slowly developed by Parliament and the courts. In 1792, Mary Wollstonecraft began the British movement for women's rights and equality,M Wollstonecraft, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects (1792). See also O de Gouges, Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen (1791) while movements behind the Tolpuddle martyrs and the Chartists drove reform for labour and democratic freedom.Turning points were the Second Reform Act 1867 and the Trade Union Act 1871. At Speakers' Corner of Hyde Park, London, here in 1944, people traditionally gather to exchange views, debate, and listen. Debating and free speech societies are found throughout the UK and make a regular part of TV.The oldest free speech and debating society in the world is Cogers (est 1755), while The Cambridge Union was established in 1815, and the Oxford Union in 1823. Most universities have student debating societies. Upon the catastrophe of World War Two and the Holocaust, the new international law order put the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 at its centre, enshrining civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights.Though a UN General Assembly Declaration, not a treaty, the rights are binding jus cogens norms in international law, since two treaties, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966 recast the UDHR. In 1950, the UK co-authored the European Convention on Human Rights, enabling people to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg even against Acts of Parliament: Parliament has always undertaken to comply with basic principles of international law.This is qualified, as in the EU, by the position that international law must be compatible with basic principles of the UK constitution: see R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport [2014] UKSC 3 (for the UK), Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council and Commission (2008) C-402/05 (for the EU) and Re W√ºnsche Handelsgesellschaft (22 October 1986) BVerfGE 73, 339 (first setting out the basic concepts). Because this appeals process was long, Parliament legislated to \\"bring rights home\\" with the Human Rights Act 1998, so that people can raise human rights claims in UK courts based on the Convention directly. The Convention contains the rights to life, rights against torture, against forced labour, to marry, to an effective remedy, and the right to suffer no discrimination in those rights.ECHR arts 2 (right to life). Article 3 (right against torture). Article 4, right against forced labour, see Somerset v Stewart (1772) 98 ER 499. Articles 12-14 are the right to marriage, effectiveness and to equal treatment. Most case law concerns the rights to liberty, privacy, freedom of conscience and expression, and to freedom of association and assembly.ECHR arts 5-11. The UK also enshrines rights to fair labour standards, social security, and a multitude of social and economic rights through its legislation. Administrative law Any person in the UK who is significantly affected by a public body's act can challenge a decision by judicial review. The claims usually begin in the High Court. Administrative law, through judicial review, is essential to hold executive power and public bodies accountable under the law. In practice, constitutional principles emerge through cases of judicial review, because every public body, whose decisions affect people's lives, is created and bound by law. A person can apply to the High Court to challenge a public body's decision if they have a \\"sufficient interest\\",Senior Courts Act 1981 s 31(3) within three months of the grounds of the cause of action becoming known.Civil Procedure Rules rule 54.5 claims can be made up to 'three months after the grounds to make the claim first arose', but the period can be shorter if legislation says so. By contrast, claims against public bodies in tort or contract, where the Limitation Act 1980 usually sets the period as 6 years.Limitation Act 1980 ss 2 and 5. But under s 11, the period is three years for personal injury or death, under s 11A ten years for defective products, and under s 15 twelve years to recover land. Almost any public body, or private bodies exercising public functions,R (Datafin) v Panel on Takeovers and Mergers [1987] QB 815 can be the target of judicial review, including a government department, a local council, any Minister, the Prime Minister, or any other body that is created by law. The only public body whose decisions cannot be reviewed is Parliament, when it passes an Act. Otherwise, a claimant can argue that a public body's decision was unlawful in five main types of case:Different books and cases categorise the grounds to review administrative discretion differently, as do different fields of law such as directors' duties in UK company law, unfair dismissal in UK labour law or implied terms in English contract law. Lord Diplock in the GCHQ case said the grounds were \\"illegality\\", \\"irrationality\\" and \\"procedural impropriety\\". A Le Sueur, M Sunkin and J Murkens, Public Law Text, Cases, and Materials (3rd edn 2016) ch 16 follows this. It is often, however, unclear how a procedural requirement of the law can be separated from substance, and it was thought that \\"irrationality\\" is too restrictive. AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2014) ch 24 now suggests substantive grounds, legitimate expectations and procedural grounds. In R (Baker) v Devon CC [1995] 1 All ER 73, 88, Sir Robin Cooke said 'The administrator must act fairly, reasonably and according to law. That is the essence and the rest is mainly machinery.' M Elliott and R Thomas, Public Law (3rd edn 2017) ch 12 generally follows this. Another categorisation of Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Rule of Law (2010) was 'Ministers and public officers at all levels must exercise the powers conferred on them in good faith, fairly, for the purposes for which the powers were conferred, without exceeding the limits of such powers and not unreasonably.' Contrast the Companies Act 2006 ss 171-177, codifying directors' duties. (1) it exceeded the lawful power of the body, used its power for an improper purpose, or acted unreasonably,Ridge v Baldwin [1964] AC 40 (following law). Padfield v Minister of Agriculture [1968] AC 997 (improper purpose), R v Home Secretary ex p Venables and Thompson [1998] AC 407 (irrelevant consideration).

The history of the UK constitution, though officially beginning in 1800,The Acts of Union 1800 unified the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland, while the Acts of Union 1707 unified England and Wales with Scotland, but did not yet officially use the name 'United Kingdom'. traces back to a time long before the four nations of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland were fully formed.See AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, Constitutional and Administrative Law (2018) ch 2, 32-48. Before the Norman Invasion of 1066, the written history of law was scant.F Pollock and FW Maitland, The history of English law before the time of Edward I (1899) Book I, ch I, 1, 'Such is the unity of all history that anyone who endeavours to tell a piece of it must feel that his first sentence tears a seamless web.' But see FW Maitland, The constitutional history of England (1909) 6, explaining pre-Norman collections of laws, and the Witan assembly to advise the King, a precursor to Parliament. William the Conqueror, advised by a King's Council (Curia Regis), established a common law in England under one monarch, and the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086 cataloguing all land and labour to levy taxes. Just 12 per cent of people were free, while the feudal system made others serfs, slaves or bordars and cottars.DD McGarry, Medieval History and Civilization (1976) 242, 12% free, 30% serfs, 35% bordars and cottars, 9% slaves. In 1190 Richard the Lionheart, more closely tied with the Pope in Rome, joined the Third Crusade to invade the Holy land, but at great cost. Taxes levied by Richard I,T Purser, Medieval England, 1042-1228 (2004) 161, this included a 25% tax on income and property, all the year's wool, and all churches gold and silver, to pay a ransom after Richard I was captured when returning from the crusades by Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor. and his successor King John to pay for the wars led to intense discontent, and the aristocracy forcing the King to sign the Magna Carta 1215. This was a commitment to hold 'common counsel' before any taxation, hold courts at a fixed place, hold trials according to law or before an accused's peers, guarantee free movement of people for trade, and give back common land.Magna Carta 1215 clauses 12 (Parliament), 17 (court), 39 (fair trial), 41 (free movement), 47 (common land). Failure to abide by Magna Carta led to the First Barons' war, and the popular legend of Robin Hood emerged: a returned crusader who robbed from the rich to give to the poor.See W Langland, Piers Plowman (1370) Passus 5, 3278, \\"But I kan rymes of Robyn Hood\\" is the first mention of the tales, notably in the run up to the Peasants' revolt of 1381. As ballads and poems evolved, see John Stow, Annales of England (1592) The commitments on common land were soon recast in the Charter of the Forest 1217, signed at St Paul's by Henry III.Charter of the Forest 1217. This allowed, for example, in clause 9, 'Every freeman shall at his own pleasure provide agistment' or grazing rights, and in clause 12, 'Henceforth every freeman, in his wood or on his land that he has in the forest, may with impunity make a mill, fish-preserve, pond, marl-pit, ditch, or arable in cultivated land outside coverts, provided that no injury is thereby given to any neighbour.' These documents established that the monarch, even with apparent authority from God, was bound by law, and it remains 'the nearest approach to an irrepealable \\"fundamental statute\\" that England has ever had.'Pollock and Maitland (1899) Book I, 173 Throughout the Middle Ages, common land was a source of welfare for common people, peasant labourers bound by a feudal system of control. In 1348, the Black Death struck England, and killed around a third of the population. As peasants lost their lords, and there was a shortage of workers, wages rose. The King and Parliament responded with the Statute of Labourers 1351 to freeze wage rises. This led to the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, where leaders demanded an end to feudalism, and for everything to be held in common.J Froissart, The Chronicles of Froissart (1385) translated by GC Macaulay (1895) 250‚Äì52, \\"What have we deserved, or why should we be kept thus in servage? We be all come from one father and one mother, Adam and Eve: whereby can they say or shew that they be greater lords than we be, saving by that they cause us to win and labour for that they dispend? They are clothed in velvet and camlet furred with grise, and we be vestured with poor cloth: they have their wines, spices and good bread, and we have the drawing out of the chaff and drink water: they dwell in fair houses, and we have the pain and travail, rain and wind in the fields; and by that that cometh of our labours they keep and maintain their estates: we be called their bondmen, and without we do readily them service, we be beaten; and we have no sovereign to whom we may complain, nor that will hear us nor do us right.\\" Despite the revolt's violent repression, slavery and serfdom broke down,EP Cheyney, 'The Disappearance of English Serfdom' (1900) 15(57) English Historical Review 20 and A Fitzherbert, Surueyenge (1546) 31, servitude was 'the greatest inconvenience that nowe is suffred by the lawe. That is to have any christen man bounden to an other, and to have the rule of his body, landes, and goodes, that his wyfe, children, and servantes have laboured for, all their life tyme, to be so taken, lyke as it were extorcion or bribery'. yet most people remained without any substantial liberty, in political or economic rights. As sheep farming became more profitable than agricultural work, enclosures of common land dispossessed more people, who turned into paupers and were punished.See Inclosure Acts and Vagrancy Act 1547. cf T More, Utopia (1516) Book I, \\"wherever it is found that the sheep of any soil yield a softer and richer wool than ordinary, there the nobility and gentry, and even those holy men, the abbots not contented with the old rents which their farms yielded... stop the course of agriculture, destroying houses and towns, reserving only the churches, and enclose grounds that they may lodge their sheep in them... Stop the rich from cornering markets and establishing virtual monopolies. Reduce the number of people who are kept doing nothing. Revive agriculture and the wool industry, so that there is plenty of honest, useful work for the great army of unemployed ‚Äì by which I mean not only existing thieves, but tramps and idle servants who are bound to become thieves eventually.\\" Under Henry VIII, to seal a divorce from Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn (who he soon beheaded for supposed infidelity), the Church of England was declared separate from Rome in the Act of Supremacy 1534, with the King as the head. The Law in Wales Act 1535 united Wales and England in one administrative system, while the King became ever more despotic, executing the Lord Chancellor, Sir Thomas More in 1535, and dissolving the monasteries and murdering those who resisted. After Henry VIII died, and power struggles following the death of his boy Edward VI at age 15,On his behalf Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset ruled as Lord Protector until he was replaced and executed by John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland. Somerset House was transferred to the crown, and Elizabeth was allowed to live there by Mary, Queen of Scots as she killed Lady Jane Grey (1554) and ruled until 1558. Mary then died without children, after killing hundreds of Protestants. Elizabeth I, the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, took the throne in 1558. Half a century of prosperity followed as Elizabeth I avoided wars, but founded corporations including the East India Company to monopolise trade routes. Under her successor, James I, further companies were created to colonise North America, including the London Company and the Virginia Company in 1606, and the Massachusetts Bay Company in 1628. Many religious dissidents left England to settle the new world. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 confirmed Parliament's supremacy over the monarch, represented by John Locke's Second Treatise on Government (1689). This laid the foundations for a peaceful unification of England and Scotland in the Act of Union 1707. While Elizabeth I maintained a Protestant church, under her successor James, who unified the Scottish and English Crowns, religious and political tensions grew as he asserted a divine right of Kings.James, The True Law of Free Monarchies (1598) This prompted a series of cases from Sir Edward Coke,Coke had already reported on many significant constitutional judgments, often adding his own style, including Heydon's Case (1584) 76 ER 637, that the task of a court in construing any statute is to find its mischief and the intention of Parliament, and Semayne's Case (1604) 5 Coke Rep 91, that nobody can enter another's property without lawful authority and that \\"the house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress, as well for his defence against injury and violence as for his repose.\\" See also Calvin's Case that a person born in Scotland is entitled to all rights in England. the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and then King's Bench courts, which denied that the King could pass judgment in legal proceedings,Case of Prohibitions [1607] EWHC J23 (KB) and held that the royal prerogative was subject to the law and cannot be expanded. Coke CJ went even further in Dr Bonham's case, holding that even that \\"the common law will control Acts of Parliament\\".(1610) 77 Eng Rep 638 Though supported by some judges,e.g. Day v Savadge (1614) Hob 85, 80 ER 235, Hobart CJ, 'even an Act of Parliament, made against natural equity, as to make a man judge in his own case, is void in itself, for jura nutrae sunt immutabilia, and they are leges legu.' R v Love (1653) 5 State Tr 825, 828, Keble J, 'Whatsoever is not consonant to the law of God, or to right reason which is maintained by scripture... be it Acts of Parliament, customs, or any judicial acts of the Court, it is not the law of England.' City of London v Wood (1701) 12 Mod 669 per Holt CJ. cf W Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765) \\"if the parliament will positively enact a thing to be done which is unreasonable, I know of no power that can control it...\\" In the US, Coke CJ's argument was applied in Marbury v Madison 5 US (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). the idea that common law courts could nullify Acts of Parliament was rejected, and the common law was formally placed under the King's control in the Earl of Oxford‚Äôs case, establishing that equity (then administered by the Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords) was above common law.(1615) 21 ER 485 Coke fell from favour,Compounded by a ruling in Peacham's Case (1614) that held it would not be treason to advocate the King's death. and was removed from judicial office. When Charles I succeeded to the throne in 1625, and more fervently asserted a divine right, including the ability to levy tax without Parliament,See Five Knights' case (1627) 3 How St Tr 1 Coke and others presented the Petition of Right 1628.Petition of Right 1628 (3 Car 1 c 1) This demanded the King to abide by Magna Carta, levy no tax without Parliament, not arbitrarily commit people to prison, not have martial law in times of peace, and not billet soldiers in private homes. Charles I responded by shutting down or proroguing Parliament and taxing trade (or \\"ship money\\") without authority. The country descended into the English Civil War in 1642 culminating in the capture and execution of King Charles I on Whitehall in 1649 by the New Model Army led by Oliver Cromwell.Debates on the proper nature of liberty were held at the Putney debates, October to November 1647, summarised in ASP Woodhouse, Puritanism and Liberty (1938) 52. By contrast, a bitter opponent of the civil war was T Hobbes, Leviathan (1651) Cromwell, not wishing to become a King, became a de facto dictator. After his death,Richard Cromwell, Oliver's son, briefly succeeded but lacking support swiftly renounced power after 9 months. the monarchy was restored with Charles II in 1660, but his successor James II again attempted to assert divine right to rule. In 1688, Parliament 'invited' a replacement King and Queen, William and Mary of Orange, and after a brief conflict forced Charles II out.The conflict ended at Battle of the Boyne. Known as the Glorious Revolution, Parliament proclaimed a new Bill of Rights 1689, with a Claim of Right Act 1689 in Scotland, that cemented Parliamentary sovereignty. As well as reaffirming Magna Carta, it says the 'pretended power of suspending laws or the execution of laws by regal authority without consent of Parliament is illegal', that 'election of members of Parliament ought to be free', and that 'Parliament ought to be held frequently'.Bill of Rights 1689 and Claim of Right 1689 arts 2, 8 and 13 The justification for government itself, encapsulated by John Locke in his Second Treatise on Government was the protection of people's rights: \\"lives, liberties and estates.\\"John Locke, Second Treatise on Government (1689) ch IX To demand democratic reform, the Chartists met on Kennington Common during the Revolutions of 1848. With Parliamentary sovereignty as the cornerstone of the new constitution, Parliament proceeded to set up a system of finance in the Bank of England Act 1694 and the Act of Settlement 1700 created an independent system of justice: judges were salaried and could not be removed except by both Houses of Parliament, no member of the House of Commons could be paid by the Crown, and the Crown had to be Anglican. In 1703, Ashby v White established that the right to vote was a constitutional right.(1703) 92 ER 126, per Holt CJ confirmed by the House of Lords. The Treaty of Union of 1707, between the then independent states of Scotland and England resulted in them both merging their states to create a new international state, the Kingdom of Great Britain, and their parliaments to create a new Union Parliament, which continued to sit at Westminster. The Treaty also arts 18 and 19, stipulated that Scottish private law would continue under a Scottish court system. The new union was soon faced with disaster as in the War of the Spanish Succession, the Spanish promised the right for British ships to trade (mostly slaves) in the seas around South America. The South Sea Company, duly incorporated to monopolise trade routes, became the object of mass financial speculation, provoked by government ministers interested in its rising share price. When it transpired, contrary to promoters' stories, that no trade was done because the Spanish had revoked their promise the stock market crashed, driving economic chaos.A Smith, The Wealth of Nations (1776) Book V, ch 1, ¬ß107 This was made worse by the decision of conservative politicians to endorse the company to take over the national debt as an alternative financier to the government over the Whig dominated Bank of England. The result of the crash was that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was imprisoned in the Tower of London for his corruption, the Postmaster General committed suicide, and the disgraced Lord Chancellor was replaced with Lord King LC who promptly ruled that people in a position of trust must avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest.Keech v Sandford [1726] EWHC J76, an English trust law case following Lord Macclesfield LC, disgraced by his role on the South Sea Company, impeached by the House of Lords and found guilty of taking bribes in 1725. Keech reversed Bromfield v Wytherley (1718) Prec Ch 505 that a fiduciary could take money from a trust and keep profits if they restored the principal afterwards. Out of the chaos, Robert Walpole emerged as a stable political figure who for 21 years held a majority of the House of Commons,Attorney General v Davy (1741) 26 ER 531 established that any body of assembled people can do a corporate act by a majority. and is now considered the first \\"Prime Minister\\".Walpole's tenure lasted from 1721-1742. In 1765, Entick v Carrington established that the government could do nothing but that which was empowered by law,Entick v Carrington [1765] EWHC KB J98 while the first teacher of English law, William Blackstone represented the standard view in his Commentaries on the Laws of England that slavery was unlawful and that \\"the spirit of liberty is so deeply ingrained in our constitution\\" any person enslaved in England must be freed. However, the transatlantic slave trade had accelerated to North American colonies. In 1772, when Lord Mansfield ruled in Somerset v Stewart that slavery was unlawful at common law,(1772) 98 ER 499 Charles Stewart from Boston, Massachusetts had bought James Somerset as a slave and taken him to England. With the help of abolitionists, Somerset escaped and sued for a writ of habeas corpus (that \\"holding his body\\" had been unlawful). Lord Mansfield, after declaring he should \\"let justice be done whatever be the consequence\\", held that slavery was \\"so odious\\" that nobody could take \\"a slave by force to be sold\\" for any \\"reason whatever\\". this set off a wave of outrage in southern, enslavement colonies of America. Together with northern colonies grievances over taxation without representation, this led to the American Revolution and declaration of independence in 1776.AW Blumrosen, 'The Profound Influence in America of Lord Mansfield's Decision in Somerset v Stuart' (2007) 13 Texas Wesleyan Law Review 645 The British military failed to hold control. Instead, it began settling Australia from 1788.Using the Transportation Act 1717 and then the Transportation Act 1790. In 1789, the French Revolution broke out, and the King was deposed with demands for \\"liberty, equality and fraternity\\". The British aristocracy reacted with repression on free speech and association to forestall any similar movement.See the Combination Acts, etc. While figures like Jeremy Bentham called natural rights \\"nonsense upon stilts\\",J Bentham, Anarchical Fallacies; Being an examination of the Declaration of Rights issued during the French Revolution (1796) Mary Wollstonecraft called for A Vindication of the Rights of Woman as well as men, arguing that unjust gender and class oppression flowed from \\"the respect paid to property... as from a poisoned fountain\\".M Wollstonecraft, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) ch IX While successful in the Napoleonic wars in defeating France, and cementing union with Ireland in the Act of Union 1800,Union with Ireland Act 1800 arts 3-4 gave Irish representation at Westminster. liberty, freedom and democracy were scarcely protected in the new \\"United Kingdom\\". The British Empire ended after WW2 as countries, where democracy and freedom were suppressed, demanded independence. The Commonwealth is now open to any country committed to peace, liberty, equality, and development, as in the Harare Declaration of 1991. During this time, with the invention of the steam engine the industrial revolution had begun. Poverty had also accelerated through the Speenhamland system of poor laws by subsidising employers and landowners with parish rates. The Corn Laws from 1815 further impoverished people by fixing prices to maintain landowner profits.T Malthus, An Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) supported this, arguing that working class \\"vice\\" and overpopulation was the cause of poverty. While the Great Reform Act 1832 extended the vote slightly, only those with property had any representation in Parliament. Although the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 abolished the slave trade within the British Empire, it only compensated slave owners and made ex-slaves in colonies pay off debts for their freedom for decades after. With the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, further punishment for poverty was inflicted as people were put into work houses if found to be unemployed. In R v Lovelass a group of agricultural workers who formed a trade union were prosecuted and sentenced to be transported to Australia under the Unlawful Oaths Act 1797,(1834) 172 ER 1380 triggering mass protests. A movement called Chartism grew demanding the right to vote for everyone in free and fair elections. As the great famine hit Ireland and millions migrated to the United States, Chartists staged a mass march from Kennington Common to Parliament in 1848 as revolutions broke out across Europe, and the Communist Manifesto was drafted by German revolutionary Karl Marx and Manchester factory owner Friedrich Engels. While the Crimean War distracted from social reform and Viscount Palmerston opposed anything,Letter to Lord Russell (October 1862) 'Power in the Hands of the Masses throws the Scum of the Community to the Surface. ... Truth and Justice are soon banished from the Land.' the American civil war of 1860 to 1865 ended slavery in the US, and the UK gradually enabled greater political freedom. In the Second Reform Act 1867 more middle class property owners were enfranchised, the Elementary Education Act 1870 provided free primary school, and the Trade Union Act 1871 enabled free association without criminal penalty.See also the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875 and Allen v Flood [1898] AC 1 The Representation of the People Act 1884 reduced the property qualification further, so that around one third of men could vote. Still, outside the UK liberty and the right to vote were violently repressed across the vast British Empire, in Africa, India, Asia and the Caribbean.See S Tharoor, Inglorious Empire (2018) From the start of the 20th century, the UK underwent vast social and constitutional change, beginning with an attempt by the House of Lords to suppress trade union freedom.Taff Vale Railway Co v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants [1901] UKHL 1 In response, the labour movement organised to support representatives in Parliament, and in the 1906 general election won 29 seats and supported the Liberal Party's programme of reform. This included a legal guarantee of the right of unions to collectively bargain and strike for fair wages,Trade Disputes Act 1906 an old age pension,Old Age Pensions Act 1908 a system of minimum wages,Trade Boards Act 1909 a People's Budget with higher taxes on the wealthy to fund spending. After a further election brought by the House of Lords blocking reform, Parliament pass a National Insurance system for welfare,National Insurance Act 1911 and the Parliament Act 1911 prevented the House of Lords blocking legislation for more than two years, and removed the right to delay any money bills.Parliament Act 1949 reduced the power to delay to one year. Despite this, the Liberal government, against the opposition of Labour, armed for and entered the First World War. At the end of the War, with millions dead, Parliament passed the Representation of the People Act 1918 which enabled every adult male the vote, although it was only after the mass protest of the Suffragettes that the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 enabled all women to vote, and that the UK became democratic. The War also triggered uprising in Ireland, and an Irish War of Independence leading to the partition of the island between the Republic of Ireland in the south and Northern Ireland in the Government of Ireland Act 1920. The Versailles Treaty at the end of the War demanded German reparations, beggaring the country through the 1920s and upon the Great Depression leading to a fascist collapse under Hitler.Predicted by JM Keynes, The Economic Consequences of the Peace (1919) The failed international law system, was replaced after the Second World War with the United Nations where the UK held a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. However the British Empire began to crumble as India, Israel and nations across Africa fought for democracy, human rights, and independence. To prevent any recurrence of the Holocaust and war, the Council of Europe was established to draft the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950. Further it was seen that the only way to prevent conflict was through economic integration. The European Economic Community, which became the European Union in 1992, was supported by Winston Churchill with the UK to be \\"at the centre\\", although it did not enter until the European Communities Act 1972. Under Margaret Thatcher, significant cuts were made to public services, labour rights, and the powers of local government, including abolishing the Greater London Council. However some powers were restored with extensive devolution of power in the Scotland Act 1998, Northern Ireland Act 1998, Greater London Authority Act 1999 and the Government of Wales Act 2006. After many years of armed conflict in Northern Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 brought peace. The Human Rights Act 1998 empowered courts to apply Convention rights without the need for claimants to take cases to the Strasbourg court. The House of Lords Act 1999 reduced but did not fully eliminate hereditary peers. Since a financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008,JC Coffee, 'What Went Wrong? An Initial Inquiry into the Causes of the 2008 Financial Crisis' (2009) 9(1) Journal of Corporate Law Studies 1. For problems starting in US regulation, see E Warren, 'Product Safety Regulation as a Model for Financial Services Regulation' (2008) 43(2) Journal of Consumer Affairs 452, and contrast the Consumer Credit Act 1974 or the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive 93/13/EEC arts 3-6. a Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition launched a programme of \\"austerity\\" cuts, and cemented their term in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. After 2015, however, early elections were held anyway in 2017, following a referendum on EU membership that resulted in 51.89 per cent of people favouring to leave, and 48.11 per cent of voters favouring to remain. Theory and reform The legal scholar Eric Barendt argues that the uncodified nature of the United Kingdom constitution does not mean it should not be characterised as a \\"constitution\\", but also claims that the lack of an effective separation of powers, and the fact that parliamentary sovereignty allows Parliament to overrule fundamental rights, makes it to some extent a \\"facade\\" constitution. Lord Scarman presents a spirited argument for a written constitution for the UK, but still refers to the 1688 compromise and resulting Acts of Parliament as a constitution. A. V. Dicey identified that ultimately \\"the electorate are politically sovereign,\\" and Parliament is legally sovereign. Barendt argues that the greater political party discipline in the House of Commons that has evolved since Dicey's era, and the reduction in checks on governmental power, has led to an excessively powerful government that is not legally constrained by the observance of fundamental rights. A Constitution would impose limits on what Parliament could do. To date, the Parliament of the UK has no limit on its power other than the possibility of extra-parliamentary action (by the people) and of other sovereign states (pursuant to treaties made by Parliament and otherwise). It has been commented by Dicey that formally, the UK Parliament was limited by the terms of the international treaties that created it in the first place. His comment that it would be imprudent for the UK Parliament to try and abolish Scots Law for example, has been criticised judicially as \\"cynical\\" but was written in the high Victorian era when Parliament was grappling with the concept of Irish Home Rule, strongly opposed by many politicians at the time. Proponents of a codified constitution argue it would strengthen the legal protection of democracy and freedom. As a strong advocate of the \\"unwritten constitution\\", Dicey highlighted that English rights were embedded in the general English common law of personal liberty, and \\"the institutions and manners of the nation\\".A V Dicey (1897) Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution Opponents of a codified constitution argue that the country is not based on a founding document that tells its citizens who they are and what they can do. There is also a belief that any unwarranted encroachment on the spirit of constitutional authority would be stiffly resisted by the British people, a perception expounded by the 19th century American judge Justice Bradley in the course of delivering his opinion in a case heard in Louisiana in 1873: \\"England has no written constitution, it is true; but it has an unwritten one, resting in the acknowledged, and frequently declared, privileges of Parliament and the people, to violate which in any material respect would produce a revolution in an hour.\\" The Labour government under prime minister Tony Blair instituted constitutional reforms in the late 1990s and early-to-mid 2000s.Dawn Oliver noted the absence of a 'master plan or coherent programme for reform of the UK constitution' and considered that the reforms were 'pragmatic responses to political pressures and perceived problems, on an ad hoc, incremental basis': as quoted by Mitchell, James, The Westminster Model and the State of Unions, Parliamentary Affairs, Vol. 63, No. 1 (Jan 2010), p. 85 The effective incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law through the Human Rights Act 1998 has granted citizens specific positive rights and given the judiciary some power to enforce them. The courts can advise Parliament of primary legislation that conflicts with the Act by means of \\"Declarations of Incompatibility\\" ‚Äì however Parliament is not bound to amend the law nor can the judiciary void any statute ‚Äì and it can refuse to enforce, or \\"strike down\\", any incompatible secondary legislation. Any actions of government authorities that violate Convention rights are illegal except if mandated by an Act of Parliament. Changes also include the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 which alters the structure of the House of Lords to separate its judicial and legislative functions. For example, the legislative, judicial and executive functions of the Lord Chancellor are now shared between the Lord Chancellor (executive), Lord Chief Justice (judicial) and the newly created post of Lord Speaker (legislative). The role of Law Lord (a member of the judiciary in the House of Lords) was abolished by transferring them to the new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in October 2009. Gordon Brown launched a \\"Governance of Britain\\" process when he took over as PM in 2007. This was an ongoing process of constitutional reform with the Ministry of Justice as lead ministry. The Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 is a piece of constitutional legislation. It enshrines in statute the impartiality and integrity of the UK Civil Service and the principle of open and fair recruitment. It enshrines in law the Ponsonby Rule which requires that treaties are laid before Parliament before they can be ratified. The Coalition Government formed in May 2010 proposed a series of further constitutional reforms in their coalition agreement. Consequently, the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 and the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 were passed. The Acts were intended to reduce the number of MPs in the House of Commons from 650 to 600, change the way the UK is divided into parliamentary constituencies, introduce a referendum on changing the system used to elect MPs and take the power to dissolve Parliament away from the monarch. The Coalition also promised to introduce law on the reform of the House of Lords. In the referendum, the Alternative Vote system was rejected by 67% to 33%, and therefore all reforms regarding the voting system were dropped.

Edwards has 60 songs to his credit., Broadcast Music Incorporated, August 18, 2009 Music career Failure Edwards' first band was the Los Angeles-based Failure. That band was active from 1990 until 1997, when bandmate Ken Andrews dissolved the band, citing personal differences. The band re-formed in 2014 with drummer Kellii Scott and embarked on a North American tour. Replicants After the completion of Failure's last studio album before the band officially dissolved, Edwards, along with bandmate Ken Andrews, former Tool bassist Paul D'Amour, and multi- instrumentalist Chris Pitman, formed the cover band Replicants.

Concept The 196-episode musical comedy-format show conveyed the concepts of cooperation and guidance for living in contemporary society. Each episode dealt with a topic such as moving away, courtesy, bragging, or patience. Though hosted by humans Doug and Emmy Jo (married in real-life Doug Momary and Emily Peden), the show featured costumed full-bodied puppet characters, primarily Freddie the Frog, Henrietta Hippo, and Charlie the Owl. The show received awards and recommendations from the National Education Association and the National School Board Association. While the show all but faded away by the early 1980s, repeats of New Zoo Revue became in demand once again in the late 1990s. New Zoo Revue was acquired from O Atlas Entertainment and the show's original co-creator, Barbara Atlas; the property is now owned by Frank A. O'Donnell, who is based in Las Vegas. The library continues to be licensed and broadcast by various networks across the US. Episodes can be viewed, and merchandise and DVDs of the original episodes can be purchased on the internet. Characters * Doug (played by Doug Momary) - A human who is friends with Freddie, Charlie, and Henrietta. * Emmy Jo (played by Emily Peden) - Emmy Jo is Doug's helper. * Freddie the Frog (performed by Yanco Inone, voiced by Joni Robbins) - Freddie is a fun-loving frog who is a bit na√Øve. While the same size as the other adult-sized characters, Freddie is characterized (at least in some episodes) as a school- aged child. * Charlie the Owl (performed by Larri Thomas, voiced by Bob Holt and later Bill Callaway) - Charlie is a serious, know-it-all owl who lives in a tall tree equipped with an elevator. Working as a scientist and an inventor, Charlie is known to give out \\"One-Bell Prizes\\" awards on occasion (subtly making a pun on the \\"No-bel\\" Prize). * Henrietta Hippo (performed by Sharon Baird, voiced by Hazel Shermet) - Henrietta is a tutu-wearing, genteel hippopotamus with a Southern Belle personality who is a bit shy. * Mr. Dingle (played by Chuck Woolery) - A friendly elderly postman who is also a shopkeeper and a Jack-of-All-Trades. * Mrs. Goodbody (played by Fran Ryan) - Mrs. Goodbody is the nosy neighbor who occasionally drops by. She served as an advice columnist for The All-New Zoo Gazette. Guest stars * Composer Henry Mancini, as well as Jim Backus of Mr. Magoo and Gilligan's Island fame, made cameos on the show. * Jesse White, best known as the original Maytag repairman in Maytag's TV commercials, guest starred on a few episodes. * June Lockhart, best known for her roles on Lassie, Lost in Space and Petticoat Junction, guest starred on an episode, \\"Shyness\\" as a woman named Penelope Potter who was very shy. * Richard Dawson, Famous for being on Hogan's Heroes & Match Game, as well as host of Family Feud and co-star of The Running Man, guest starred in the \\"Time Travel\\" episode as a knight from medieval England. * Jo Anne Worley appeared as talk show host Vanessa Gramcracker. Post-New Zoo Revue The original creator of the series, Doug Momary, runs a company named Laguna Productions, which produces commercials, public service announcements and training films. He lives in Texas with his wife, Emily Peden. In 2001, Peden became the vice president of Finance with Laguna Productions, which was developing a new children's show for PBS, The New Crusaders, that same year.

Charles Cohen and starring Frances Hyland and James B. Douglas. It was the National Film Board of Canada's first English-language feature film. Plot Drylanders is set in Canada at the turn of the century. Daniel Greer (James Douglas) returns home after the Boer War to find city life not to his liking. Instead, he opts for the life of a wheat farmer. At first, his farm is prosperous, but he becomes victim to a nationwide drought. He struggles to keep his farm afloat, but dies before he could see the end of the drought. His wife (Frances Hyland) continues her husband's work on the farm. Cast * Frances Hyland as Liza * James B. Douglas as Dan (as James Douglas) * Lester Nixon as Bob MacPherson * Mary Savidge as Ada MacPherson (as Mary Savage) * William Fruet as Colin (as William Fruete) * Don Francks as Russel * Ir√©na Mayeska as Thora (as Irena Mayeska) Production Drylanders was a fictionalized documentary similar to earlier French-language productions from the NFB's Panoramique series and dramas in the English-language Perspective series. Heavily promoted during its release, the film was modestly successful at the box office. Drylanders came about after a documentary on farming and irrigation in Saskatchewan, suggested by writer Charles Cohen, had been rejected by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Director Donald Haldane then suggested making a fiction film. Cohen wrote a personal story, concentrating on the trials of the \\"Greer\\" family, who had come from Montreal to try their luck at farming. The film was filmed in black and white, in SuperScope: a less expensive alternative to CinemaScope. It was the first time SuperScope had been used at the NFB. Filming began in the summer of 1961, shooting in and around Swift Current, Saskatchewan. Several stage actors from Toronto were brought in for the principal roles, including Hyland and Douglas. Local actors were signed for some of the smaller supporting roles. Filming on the Prairies took several weeks. A key blizzard scene was shot in winter of 1962 at the NFB studio in Montreal. The production budget rose to about $218,000, roughly twice what was planned. Release Columbia Pictures distributed the film, premiering Drylanders in Swift Current, then releasing across the Prairies, a couple of towns at a time. The film was also released in British Columbia and Eastern Canada, eventually playing in more than 500 cinemas nationwide. The film was offered as part of a double feature or accompanied by the NFB documentary Fields of Sacrifice. A French-language version, Un autre pays, played across Quebec. The film was released theatrically in the United Kingdom, United States and Central and South America. It would also play on television in Switzerland, Yugoslavia, China and Malaysia, among other countries. It played theatrically throughout 1963 and 1964 before making its way to the non-theatrical circuit, where it was shown in schools and community centres on 16 mm. It later enjoyed a second career on television and home video.

He is considered one of the strongest players never to have become World Chess Champion. Born in Leningrad, Soviet Union, Korchnoi defected to the Netherlands in 1976, and resided in Switzerland from 1978, becoming a Swiss citizen. Korchnoi played four matches, three of which were official, against GM Anatoly Karpov. In 1974, he lost the Candidates final to Karpov, who was declared World Champion in 1975 when GM Bobby Fischer refused to defend his title. Korchnoi then won two consecutive Candidates cycles to qualify for World Championship matches with Karpov in 1978 and 1981, but lost both. The two players also played a drawn training match of six games in 1971. Korchnoi was a candidate for the World Championship on ten occasions (1962, 1968, 1971, 1974, 1977, 1980, 1983, 1985, 1988 and 1991). He was also four times a USSR chess champion, five times a member of Soviet teams that won the European championship, and six times a member of Soviet teams that won the Chess Olympiad. In September 2006, he won the World Senior Chess Championship. Early life, family, and education Korchnoi was born on 23 March 1931 in Leningrad, USSR, to a Jewish mother and a Polish-Catholic father.–í–∏–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –ö–æ—Ä—á–Ω–æ–π ¬´–®–∞—Ö–º–∞—Ç—ã –±–µ–∑ –ø–æ—â–∞–¥—ã¬ª (memoires of Victor Kotchnoi) His mother, Zelda Gershevna Azbel (1910‚Äî?), a daughter of the Yiddish writer Hersh Azbel, was a pianist and alumna of Leningrad Conservatory of Music; his father, Lev Merkuryevich Korchnoi (1910‚Äî1941), was an engineer, who worked at a candy factory.–í–∏–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –ö–æ—Ä—á–Ω–æ–π ¬´–®–∞—Ö–º–∞—Ç—ã –±–µ–∑ –ø–æ—â–∞–¥—ã¬ª (full text of Korchoi's autobiographical book): Here Korchnoi also mentions that his maternal grandmother Tsilya Azbel was killed during a Jewish pogrom in Kiev in 1919.

After their divorce, Victor lived with his mother until 1935, then with his father, paternal grandmother and later his adoptive mother Roza Abramovna Fridman (who took responsibility for his upbringing when his father was killed during the siege of Leningrad in 1941, and later lived with him in Switzerland).–õ–∞—Ä–∏—Å–∞ –í–æ–ª—å–ø–µ—Ä—Ç ¬´–û–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∏–º—ã–π —Å–ª—É–∂–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å –ö–∞–∏—Å—Å—ã¬ªKorchnoi family flies out ‚Äî with family dog He graduated from Leningrad State University with a major in history.Great Chess Upsets, by Samuel Reshevsky, New York 1976, Arco Publishing, p. 244. Early chess development He learned to play chess from his father at the age of five. In 1943, he joined the chess club of the Leningrad Pioneer Palace, and was trained by Abram Model, Andrei Batuyev, and Vladimir Zak. Model had earlier played a major role in the development of future World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik, while Zak, who later co-authored a book with Korchnoi, had also helped train future World Champion Boris Spassky. Soviet Junior Champion In 1947, Korchnoi won the Junior Championship of the USSR, with 11¬Ω/15 at Leningrad, and shared the title in 1948 with 5/7 at Tallinn, Estonia.Karpov‚ÄìKorchnoi 1978: The Inside Story of the Match, by Raymond Keene, Batsford 1978, p. 10. Young master In 1951, he earned the Soviet Master title, following his second-place finish in the 1950 Leningrad Championship, with 9/13. First Soviet final One year later, Korchnoi qualified for the finals of the USSR Chess Championship for the first time. In the semifinal at Minsk, 1952, he scored 10¬Ω/17 for a shared 2nd‚Äì4th place, to advance. In the 20th Soviet final, held at Moscow, he scored 11/19 for sixth place, as GM Mikhail Botvinnik and GM Mark Taimanov came joint first. The next year, he again had to qualify through the semifinal event held at Vilnius 1953, with 9/14 for a shared 3rd‚Äì4th place. Korchnoi improved on the previous year's showing with his shared 2nd‚Äì3rd place in URS-ch21 at Kiev 1954, on 13/19, as GM Yuri Averbakh won. International titles This high championship placing was rewarded with his first international opportunity, a participation in Bucharest 1954, where he finished in clear first place with 13/17.chessmetrics.com the Viktor Korchnoi player file FIDE awarded him the title of International Master in 1954. He won the 1955 Leningrad Championship with a massive score of 17/19, and shared 1st‚Äì2nd places at Hastings 1955‚Äì56 on 7/9. He was awarded the Grandmaster title at the FIDE Congress in 1956. Soviet team record Korchnoi earned his first international team selection for the Soviet student team in 1954, joined the full national team for the European Team Championship three years later, and would represent the USSR through 1974. He won 21 medals for the USSR. His complete Soviet international team play results follow: * Oslo 1954, Student Olympiad, board 1, 4¬Ω/7 (+3‚àí1=3), team silver * Uppsala 1956, Student Olympiad, board 1, 6/7 (+5‚àí0=2), team gold * Vienna 1957, European Team Championship, board 8, 5¬Ω/6 (+5‚àí0=1), team gold, board gold * Leipzig 1960 Olympiad, board 4, 10¬Ω/13 (+8‚àí0=5), team gold; board bronze * Oberhausen 1961, European Team Championship, board 6, 8¬Ω/9 (+8‚àí0=1), team gold, board gold * Hamburg 1965, European Team Championship, board 3, 5¬Ω/9 (+4‚àí2=3), team gold, board gold * Havana 1966 Olympiad, 1st reserve, 10¬Ω/13 (+9‚àí1=3), team gold, board gold * Lugano 1968 Olympiad, board 3, 11/13 (+9‚àí0=4), team gold * Kapfenberg 1970, European Team Championship, board 2, 4/6 (+2‚àí0=4), team gold * Siegen 1970 Olympiad, board 3, 11/15 (+8‚àí1=6), team gold, board bronze * Skopje 1972 Olympiad, board 2, 11/15 (+8‚àí1=6), team gold, board gold * Bath 1973, European Team Championship, board 3, 4/6 (+3‚àí1=2), team gold * Nice 1974 Olympiad, board 2, 11¬Ω/15 (+8‚àí0=7), team gold, board bronze Strong Grandmaster Korchnoi rose to prominence within the Soviet chess school system, where he competed against his contemporaries and future GM stars such as Mikhail Tal, Tigran Petrosian, and Boris Spassky, following in the path laid out by Mikhail Botvinnik. Korchnoi's playing style initially was an aggressive counterattack. He excelled in difficult defensive positions. His results during the 1950s were often inconsistent. One particularly bad result was his 19th place (only one from bottom) at the URSch-22, Moscow 1955, with 6/19. During the 1960s he became more versatile, as he gained experience at the top level. He won at Krak√≥w 1959 with 8¬Ω/11, shared 1st‚Äì2nd places with GM Samuel Reshevsky at Buenos Aires 1960 with 13/19, and won at C√≥rdoba, Argentina 1960 with 6/7.Karpov‚ÄìKorchnoi 1978, the Inside Story of the Match, by Raymond Keene, pp. 10‚Äì11 After his victory at Budapest 1961 (G√©za Mar√≥czy Memorial) with 11¬Ω/15 ahead of GMs David Bronstein and Miroslav Filip, each with 9¬Ω, Korchnoi was recognized as one of the world's best players.The field also included Mark Taimanov at 9/15, Lajos Portisch (9), Vladimir Simagin (9), P√©ter Dely (9), Wolfgang Uhlmann (8¬Ω), Gedeon Barcza (8), Istv√°n Bilek (7), Jan Hein Donner (6¬Ω), and Arthur Bisguier (6). Soviet Championship titles Korchnoi won the USSR Chess Championship four times during his career. At Leningrad 1960 for URS-ch27, he scored 14/19. He won at Yerevan 1962, URS-ch30, with 13/19. He won at Kiev 1964‚Äì65 with 15/19. His final title was at Riga 1970, for URS- ch38, with 16/21. World Championship title candidate He first qualified as a candidate from the 1962 Stockholm Interzonal, scoring 14/22 for a shared 4th‚Äì5th-place finish, a tournament won by Fischer. The 1962 Candidates tournament, the last held in a round-robin format until 1985, was held at Cura√ßao a few months later and Korchnoi placed fifth out of eight with an even score, 13¬Ω/27, which Tigran Petrosian won, winning the right to challenge Botvinnik. Korchnoi's results included two victories over Fischer, one a brilliant win employing the Pirc Defense with the black pieces. Korchnoi won at Havana 1963 with 16¬Ω/21, but fared less well in the next Soviet Championship, URS-ch31 at Leningrad, with just 10/19 for 10th place. He missed qualifying for the next world championship cycle, 1964‚Äì66, because of a poor showing at the 1964 Zonal tournament in Moscow, where he made 5¬Ω/12 for a shared 5th‚Äì6th place, so did not advance to the Interzonal. Korchnoi regained his form with an overwhelming triumph at Gyula, Hungary, in 1965 with 14¬Ω/15. He won at Bucharest 1966 with 12¬Ω/14, and at the Chigorin Memorial in Sochi 1966 with 11¬Ω/15.Karpov‚ÄìKorchnoi 1978: the Inside Story of the Match, by Raymond Keene, Batsford 1978 Candidates' finalist, first time In the 1969 World Championship cycle, he tied for 3rd‚Äì5th places at the URS-ch34, held at Tbilisi 1966‚Äì67, with 12/20, and emerged from a three-way playoff, along with GM Aivars Gipslis, at Tallinn 1967, to the Interzonal, staged at Sousse, Tunisia, later that year. A strong performance at the Interzonal, with 14/22, for a shared 2nd‚Äì4th place, took him through to the Candidates' matches. In his first match, he defeated American GM Samuel Reshevsky at Amsterdam in 1968 by (+3=5). His next opponent was GM Mikhail Tal, against whom Korchnoi had a large plus score in previous meetings. The match, held in Moscow 1968, was close, but Korchnoi won by (+2‚àí1=7), and moved on to face GM Boris Spassky in the Candidates' final. Spassky prevailed at Kiev 1968, winning (+4‚àí1=5). USSR vs Rest of the World 1970; Rest of the World vs USSR 1984 Korchnoi represented the USSR on board three in the first Russia (USSR) vs Rest of the World team match, Belgrade 1970, which took place across ten boards. He played four games with Hungarian GM Lajos Portisch, drawing three and losing one. In 1984, eight years after his defection, Korchnoi played board three in the second Rest of the World vs USSR match in London, with the match again held across ten boards. He faced Soviet GM Lev Polugaevsky, his former teammate, in three games, winning one and drawing two; he then faced GM Vladimir Tukmakov in one game, drawing. Korchnoi was the only player to play for each side in the series of two team matches. Plays secret training matches Korchnoi, as the losing finalist, was exempt from qualifying for the 1972 World Championship cycle, and was seeded directly to the following Candidates' event. To prepare, he first played a secret training match with his good friend GM David Bronstein, who drew the 1951 World Championship match, in Leningrad 1970, losing 3¬Ω‚Äì2¬Ω. This result was kept secret until 1995; the games from this match were kept secret until 2007, when they were eventually published in Bronstein's last book, Secret Notes.Secret Notes, by David Bronstein and Sergei Voronkov, Zurich 2007, Edition Olms. Then, he played a secret training match against GM Anatoly Karpov, with whom he was close friends at the time, at Leningrad 1971; this wound up drawn in six games (+2‚àí2=2); Korchnoi took the Black pieces in five of them, for training purposes. These games were eventually published in 1976.The Complete Games of World Champion Anatoly Karpov, by Kevin O'Connell, David Levy and Jimmy Adams, London 1976, Batsford, (paperback), pp. 146-149 Korchnoi won his first round 1971 match against GM Efim Geller at Moscow by (+4‚àí1=3), after which he went down to defeat in the semifinal versus GM Tigran Petrosian by (‚àí1=9), also at Moscow, with the ninth game the only decisive result. Korchnoi (Amsterdam, 1972) Actor In 1972, Korchnoi appeared in the chess-themed Soviet film Grossmeister along with several other grandmasters; he played the role of the lead actor's trainer. Candidates' finalist, second time In the 1975 World Championship cycle Korchnoi and Karpov, the newest star of Soviet chess, tied for first in the 1973 Leningrad Interzonal. In the 1974 Candidates' matches, Korchnoi first defeated the young Brazilian star GM Henrique Costa Mecking (who had won the other Interzonal in Petr√≥polis), by (+3‚àí1=9) at Augusta, Georgia, in what he later described in his autobiography as a tough match. Korchnoi next played Petrosian again, at Odessa. The two were not on friendly terms, and it was even rumored that the two resorted to kicking each other under the table during this match; however, Korchnoi denies this. According to him, Petrosian just kicked his legs nervously and shook the table. Although the match was supposed to go to the first player to win four games, Petrosian resigned the match after just five games, with Korchnoi enjoying a lead of 3‚Äì1, with one draw. With his victory over Petrosian, Korchnoi advanced to face Karpov in the Candidates' Final, the match to determine who would challenge reigning world champion Bobby Fischer in 1975. In the run-up to the match, Korchnoi was constantly subjected to threats and harassment, and was virtually unable to find any Grandmasters to assist him. Bronstein apparently assisted Korchnoi, for which he was punished. Bronstein, in his last book, Secret Notes, published in 2007, wrote that he advised Korchnoi before the match began, but then had to leave to play an event himself; when he returned, Korchnoi was down by three games. Bronstein then assisted Korchnoi for the final stages.Secret Notes, by David Bronstein and Sergey Voronkov, Zurich 2007, Edition Olms. Korchnoi also received some assistance later in the match from two British masters, IM (later GM) Raymond Keene and IM William Hartston.Karpov‚ÄìKorchnoi 1978: the Inside Story of the Match, by Raymond Keene, London, Batsford 1978, pp. 17‚Äì19 Korchnoi trailed 3‚Äì0 late in the match, but won games 19 and 21 to make it very close right to the end. Karpov eventually won this battle, played in late 1974 in Moscow, by a 12¬Ω‚Äì11¬Ω score. By default, Karpov became the twelfth world champion in April 1975, when Fischer refused to defend his title because of disputed match conditions. Defection In the lead-up to the Candidates' Final in 1974, as part of a campaign to promote Karpov over Korchnoi, Tigran Petrosian made a public statement in the press against Korchnoi, with the Soviet federation, wishing to develop younger players, taking the stance that the generation (including Korchnoi) which had been defeated by Bobby Fischer could no longer hope to compete successfully against him. At the closing ceremony of the Candidates' Final, Korchnoi had made his mind up that he had to leave the Soviet Union. The central authorities prevented Korchnoi from playing any international tournaments outside the USSR. Even when Korchnoi was invited by GM Paul Keres and IM Iivo Nei to participate in a 1975 International Tournament in the Estonian SSR, Korchnoi was not allowed to play, and both Keres and Nei were reprimanded. Keres did play a short, apparently secret, training match at Tallinn 1975 with Korchnoi, who won (+1=1). Korchnoi was then allowed to play the Soviet Team Championship and an international tournament in Moscow later in 1975. The ban against Korchnoi competing outside the USSR was lifted when he accompanied fellow veteran GMs Mark Taimanov and Bronstein to London to play a Scheveningen-style event (where each team member competes against only the other team's players) against three young British masters: Jonathan Mestel, Michael Stean and David S. Goodman. Korchnoi then played the international tournament at Hastings, 1975‚Äì76.chessmetrics.com, the Viktor Korchnoi results file Korchnoi, in a 2006 lecture in London, mentioned that the breakthrough that allowed him to resume international appearances came when Anatoly Karpov inherited the World Championship title forfeited by Fischer. Questions arose about how Karpov had qualified to be a World Champion, when he had never played Fischer. Since Korchnoi was not publicly visible, it was largely believed that he (and Karpov) could not be very strong. Korchnoi was then allowed to play the 1976 Amsterdam tournament, as a means to prove Karpov was a worthy World Champion. Korchnoi was joint winner of the tournament, along with GM Tony Miles. At the end of the tournament, Korchnoi asked Miles to spell \\"political asylum\\" for him, whereupon Korchnoi entered the police station to defect, having smuggled his chess library out of the USSR in two stages, on this trip as well as the previous year's trip to England.Keene As a result, after the chess tournament in Amsterdam, Korchnoi became the first strong Soviet grandmaster to defect from the Soviet Union.Efim Bogolyubov and Alexander Alekhine both left the Soviet Union in the 1920s, but these are not usually regarded as defections. Korchnoi left his wife and son behind. The defection resulted in a turbulent period of excellent tournament results, losses in the two matches for the World Title, all overshadowed by the oppressive political climate of the Cold War. Korchnoi resided in the Netherlands for some time, giving simultaneous exhibitions. He played a short match against GM Jan Timman ‚Äì the strongest active non-Soviet player at that time ‚Äì and comprehensively defeated him. He moved to West Germany for a short period, and then eventually settled in Switzerland by 1978, becoming a Swiss citizen. First World Championship match against Karpov In the next world championship cycle (1976‚Äì78), for which he qualified as the losing finalist, Korchnoi first had to overcome Soviet demands that he be forfeited due to his defection; FIDE President GM Max Euwe defended Korchnoi's right to participate. Korchnoi began actual play by again vanquishing Petrosian, by (+2‚àí1=9) in the quarter-final round at Il Ciocco, Italy, taking a clinching draw in a clearly favourable position in the final game. In the semifinal, held at Evian, France, Korchnoi won against GM Lev Polugaevsky, with a score of (+5‚àí1=7). The final, in which he faced Spassky at Belgrade, began with five wins and five draws for Korchnoi, after which he lost four consecutive games. The match was noteworthy for Spassky's scandalous psychological behavior after game 10 where Spassky refused to play at the game board, instead analyzing the game from a demonstration board while seated in a box located behind Korchnoi. Ultimately, Korchnoi steeled himself and finally secured victory in the match by (+7‚àí4=7) to emerge as the challenger to Karpov, having defeated three world-class Soviet contenders. The World Championship match of 1978 was held in Baguio, Philippines. There was enormous controversy off the board, ranging from X-raying of chairs, protests about the flags used on the board, hypnotism complaints and the mirror glasses used by Korchnoi. When Karpov's team sent him a bilberry yogurt during a game without any request for one by Karpov, the Korchnoi team protested, claiming it could be some kind of code (such as whether Korchnoi was dead equal or slightly advantageous). They later said this was intended as a parody of earlier protests, but it was taken seriously at the time.; Karpov vs. Korchnoi 1978, Keene In quality of play, the match itself never measured up to the press headlines that it generated, although as a sporting contest it had its share of excitement. The match would go to the first player to win six games, draws not counting. After 17 games, Karpov had an imposing 4‚Äì1 lead. Korchnoi won game 21, but Karpov won game 27, putting him on the brink of victory with a 5‚Äì2 lead. Korchnoi bravely fought back, scoring three wins and one draw in the next four games, to equalise the match at 5‚Äì5 after 31 games. However, Karpov won the very next game, and the match, by 6‚Äì5 with 21 draws. Korchnoi alleged that when acting as his second in this match, Raymond Keene broke his contract by writing a book about the match (which appeared three days after the match finished) having specifically signed an agreement \\"not to write, compile or help to write or compile any book during the course of the match\\". Korchnoi commented: \\"Mr Keene betrayed me. He violated the contract. It was clear that while Mr Keene was writing one book and then another, Mr Stean was doing his work for him.\\"\\"Keene's Gambit\\" by Nick Pitt, Sunday Times magazine 13 January 1991, p. 20. Attempts to defend Keene were rebutted by Michael Stean's mother, who stated that she was in a position to know what was in Keene's contract since she herself had typed it. Keene, she claimed, had signed this despite having already negotiated a contract with Batsford to write a book about the match. She described \\"a premeditated and deliberate plan to deceive\\" and noted that Keene's conduct had come under suspicion during the match.\\"When Keene was taxed by Petra Leeuwerik and Viktor Korchnoi as to whether he was writing a book during the match, as he was spending so much of his time in the Press Office sending telex messages, Keene emphatically denied it.\\" Chess, February 1980, pp. 84‚Äì85, letter from Mrs Jean Stean.What Jean Stean had seen Streatham and Brixton Chess Blog, 19 April 2013. Second World Championship match against Karpov As the losing world title match finalist, Korchnoi was seeded into the next cycle's final eight players. In his first match, Korchnoi once more defeated Petrosian in March 1980 at Velden am W√∂rthersee, Austria, by 5¬Ω to 3¬Ω. This victory earned him a rematch with Polugaevsky, whom he had defeated in the previous cycle. At Buenos Aires during July and August 1980, Korchnoi again triumphed by 7¬Ω to 6¬Ω; the match was tied following the regulation ten games. In the final match, at Merano, Italy, from December 1980 to January 1981, Korchnoi was leading West German GM Robert Hubner by 4¬Ω to 3¬Ω, with two more possible regulation games to come, when Hubner withdrew from the match. This forfeit advanced Korchnoi to a rematch for the title against Karpov. This final match was also held in Merano, Italy. The headline of the tournament again largely centered on the political issues. Korchnoi's wife and son were still in the Soviet Union. His son had been promised release to join his father in exile if he gave up his passport. When he did so, he was promptly drafted into the Soviet army. In spite of protests, Korchnoi's son was arrested for evading army service, sentenced to two and a half years in labour camp, and served the full sentence. After the release, he was again refused permission to leave the USSR. (In 1982, six years after Korchnoi's defection, his son finally succeeded in leaving the country. His wife also left the USSR, and the two divorced.) In what was dubbed the \\"Massacre in Merano\\", Karpov defeated Korchnoi by six wins to two, with ten draws. Playing Kasparov Korchnoi in 2009 Korchnoi, however, still had a vital part to play in the next (1984) Candidates' cycle, although he never reached the highest pinnacle again. In the first match, he defeated GM Lajos Portisch by 6‚Äì3 at Bad Kissingen 1983. In the second round, he was to play the young Soviet GM Garry Kasparov, who at the time was battling against a Soviet Chess Federation that was clearly in favour of Anatoly Karpov. The match was to be held in Pasadena, California, but the Soviet Chess Federation protested (possibly because Korchnoi was a defector and the match was in the cold-war enemy's back yard, in a place closed to Soviet diplomats at the time, and because of the soon-to-be-announced Soviet decision to boycott the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles). Kasparov was not allowed to fly there to play the match. This defaulted the match to Korchnoi. Another Soviet contender, former Champion GM Vassily Smyslov, was also at first forfeited to Hungarian GM Zoltan Ribli, with their match set to take place in the United Arab Emirates. However, upon intervention by prominent British chess organizer GM Raymond Keene, who quickly stepped up to raise a large amount of sponsorship money to save the troubled matches, Korchnoi agreed to play Kasparov in London, which at the same time also hosted the Smyslov vs. Ribli match. This was a gracious gesture by Korchnoi, since technically he had already won by default. After a good start, winning the first game, Korchnoi was beaten by a score of 7‚Äì4, with Kasparov, who was 32 years younger, proving that his all- round game and youthful stamina were too strong. Three more Candidates' appearances After the 1983 Kasparov match, Korchnoi continued playing at a top level but without seriously threatening the world championship again. In the 1985‚Äì87 World Championship cycle he finished equal thirteenth out of 16 in the Candidates' Tournament at Montpellier. In the 1988‚Äì90 cycle, he made the final 16 again, but was eliminated in the first round of Candidates' matches, held at Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, losing to Iceland's GM Johann Hjartarson in extra games, by 4¬Ω to 3¬Ω. Finally, in the 1991‚Äì93 cycle, he defeated GM Gyula Sax of Hungary in the first round, by 5¬Ω to 4¬Ω at Wijk aan Zee. Then, at Brussels, he lost to GM Jan Timman of the Netherlands by 4¬Ω to 2¬Ω, ending his run at the Candidates', which stretched from 1962 to 1991. Later career He continued to play in Europe and around the world to an advanced age, living in his adopted country of Switzerland. He frequently represented their Olympiad team on top board, beginning in 1978, even though his Elo rating was sometimes considerably below that of compatriot Vadim Milov, who appeared not to make himself available for selection. From 2001 onwards, Korchnoi became a prolific author of books on his career, publishing five new volumes, including two books of annotated games, an updated autobiography, and an overview (along with several other authors) of Soviet politics applying to chess; he also wrote a book on rook endings. In 2001, Korchnoi won the Biel Chess Festival for the second time in the grandmasters division, having also won in 1979. This 22 year gap still stands as the longest time period between being champion at Biel tournament, or quite possibly any international chess tournament. In September 2006, Korchnoi won the 16th World Senior Chess Championship, held in Arvier (Valle d'Aosta, Italy), at age 75, with a 9‚Äì2 score. Korchnoi scored 7¬Ω‚Äì¬Ω in his first eight games, then drew his last three games. On the January 2007 FIDE rating list Korchnoi was ranked number 85 in the world at age 75, the oldest player ever to be ranked in the FIDE top 100. The second-oldest player on the January 2007 list was Alexander Beliavsky, age 53, who was 22 years younger than Korchnoi. As of 2011, Korchnoi was still active in the chess world with a notable win (in Gibraltar) with black against the 18-year-old Fabiano Caruana, who was rated above 2700 and 61 years Korchnoi's junior. Korchnoi became the oldest player ever to win a national championship, when he won the 2009 Swiss championship at age 78. He won the national title again a few months after his 80th birthday in July 2011 after a playoff game with Joseph Gallagher. Declining health In late December 2012, it was reported that Korchnoi was recovering from a stroke and was unlikely to play competitive chess again. He was scheduled to play in the 37th Zurich Christmas Open tournament in December 2013, but withdrew due to health reasons. However, in 2014, he returned to the board to play a two-game match against GM Wolfgang Uhlmann (b.1935), winning both games; the combined age of the two players was 162 years, which is almost certainly a record for a standard play match between Grandmasters. In 2015 the two played a four-game rapid play match (25 minutes per player for all moves, plus 30 seconds extra per move), which was drawn 2‚Äì2. Korchnoi's final match against another Grandmaster was a similar four- game rapid play match in November 2015, against GM Mark Taimanov (1926‚Äì2016) ‚Äì the first time since 1980 that Korchnoi had played in an official or friendly match an opponent older than himself. The combined ages of the players was 174. Korchnoi won the match 2‚Äì1 with one draw. Death Korchnoi died aged 85 on 6 June 2016 in the Swiss city of Wohlen. Legacy FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov said that Korchnoi \\"has contributed substantially to the popularisation of our sport and is considered rightly as one of the strongest and charismatic players in the entire history of world chess.\\" One obituary, written by Leonard Barden, called him \\"the greatest player never to have been world champion\\". Korchnoi was comfortable playing with or without the initiative. He could attack, counterattack, play positionally, and was a master of the endgame. He became known as the master of counterattack, and he was the most difficult opponent of Mikhail Tal, an out-and-out attacker. He had a large lifetime plus score against Tal (+13‚àí4=27), and also had plus scores against world champions Petrosian and Spassky. He had equal records against Botvinnik (+1‚àí1=2) and Fischer (+2‚àí2=4). He defeated nine undisputed world champions from Botvinnik through to Garry Kasparov, and Magnus Carlsen. At times Korchnoi displayed his temper after losing games by swiping all the pieces off the board. More often, however, he displayed genial manners. In the 1983 U.S. Open Chess Championship in Pasadena, California, Korchnoi was paired against GM Larry Christiansen who was late showing up to the game when his \\"old jalopy\\" car ran out of gas on the way to the event. Rather than starting Christiansen's clock, Korchnoi waited until Christiansen arrived‚Äîa very kind gesture indeed. Korchnoi never succeeded in becoming world chess champion, but many people consider him the strongest player never to have done so, a distinction also often attributed to Paul Keres. On the other hand, the 10th world champion Boris Spassky argued that Korchnoi did not deserve to be champion, both because he did not play the best moves (sometimes taking 140 moves to win a game that could have been won in 40), and because he did not have any individuality. One of the variations of the English Opening is called the Korchnoi Variation, a variation for White against the French Defense is called the Korchnoi GambitFrench Defense Korchnoi Gambit - Chess.com and a closed variation of the Sicilian Defense is called the Korchnoi Defense. Records Korchnoi defeated nine undisputed world champions (Botvinnik, Smyslov, Tal, Petrosian, Spassky, Fischer, Karpov, Kasparov and Carlsen), a record he shares with Paul Keres and Alexander Beliavsky. He is the only player to have won or drawn‚Äîin individual game(s)‚Äîagainst every World Chess Champion, disputed or undisputed, since the world chess championship interregnum of World War II.http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1032541, http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1080916, http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1081033, http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1081400, http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1080843, http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1044162, http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1067518, http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1070036, http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1083768, http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1018192, http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1074376, http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1345132, http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1074376, http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1257370, http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1083527, http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1326963 , Books     * In popular culture * Korchnoi's 1976 defection is thought to have inspired in part the plot of the 1986 musical Chess. * In Dangerous Moves, a film from 1984, the \\"match and the characters are reminiscent of the real-life 1981 match between Viktor Korchnoi and Anatoly Karpov\\". * The year 2018 saw the release of a documentary film, Closing Gambit, which \\"tells the full story of the infamous 1978 Karpov‚ÄìKorchoi match\\".

With a length of and wingspan of it is the largest species of frigatebird. It occurs over tropical and subtropical waters off America, between northern Mexico and Per√∫ on the Pacific coast and between Florida and southern Brazil along the Atlantic coast. There are also populations on the Gal√°pagos Islands in the Pacific and the Cape Verde islands in the Atlantic. The magnificent frigatebird is a large, lightly built seabird with brownish-black plumage, long narrow wings and a deeply forked tail. The male has a striking red gular sac which it inflates to attract a mate. The female is slightly larger than the male and has a white breast and belly. Frigatebirds feed on fish taken in flight from the ocean's surface (often flying fish), and sometimes indulge in kleptoparasitism, harassing other birds to force them to regurgitate their food. History and etymology Christopher Columbus encountered magnificent frigatebirds when passing the Cape Verde Islands on his first voyage across the Atlantic in 1492. His journal for the voyage survives in a version made in the 1530s by Bartolom√© de las Casas. The entry for 29 September reads in English: > They saw a bird that is called a frigatebird, which makes the boobies throw > up what they eat in order to eat it herself, and she does not sustain > herself on anything else. It is a seabird, but does not alight on the sea > nor depart from land 20 leagues. There are many of these on the islands of > Cape Verde. In the 15th century text the name of the bird is written as rabifor√ßado. The modern Spanish word for a frigatebird is rabihorcado or \\"forked tail\\". A population of magnificent frigatebirds once bred on the Cape Verde Islands but is now probably extinct. The word frigatebird derives from the French mariners' name for the bird La Fr√©gate - a frigate or fast warship. The etymology of the name was given by French naturalist Jean-Baptiste du Tertre when describing the magnificent frigatebird in 1667. English mariners referred to frigatebirds as Man-of-War birds. This name was used by the English explorer William Dampier in his book An Account of a New Voyage Around the World published in 1697: > The Man-of-War (as it is called by the English) is about the bigness of a > Kite, and in shape like it, but black; and the neck is red. It lives on Fish > yet never lights on the water, but soars aloft like a Kite, and when it sees > its prey, it flys down head foremost to the Waters edge, very swiftly takes > its prey out of the Sea with his Bill, and immediately mounts again as > swiftly; never touching the Water with his Bill. His Wings are very long; > his feet are like other Land-fowl, and he builds on Trees, where he finds > any; but where they are wanting on the ground. The modern name Frigate Bird was used in 1738 by the English naturalist and illustrator Eleazar Albin in his A Natural History of the Birds. The book included an illustration of the male bird showing the red gular pouch. Like the genus name, the English term is derived from the French mariners' name for the bird la fr√©gate‚Äîa frigate or fast warship. The genus name, Fregata has the same source as the English term, and magnificens is Latin for \\"splendidly\\", from magnificus, \\"grand\\". Taxonomy The magnificent frigatebird was originally considered to belong to the species Fregata aquila but in 1914 the Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews proposed that the magnificent frigatebird should be considered as a separate species with the binomial name Fregata magnificens. Of the four other species within the genus Fregata, genetic analysis has shown that the magnificent frigatebird is most closely related to the Ascension frigatebird (Fregata aquila). Distribution The magnificent frigatebird is widespread in the tropical Atlantic, breeding colonially in trees in Florida, the Caribbean and also along the Pacific coast of the Americas from Mexico to Ecuador, including the Gal√°pagos Islands. It has occurred as a vagrant as far from its normal range as the Isle of Man, Denmark, Spain, England, and British Columbia. Description Copacabana beach, Brazil Female juvenile The magnificent frigatebird is the largest species of frigatebird. It measures in length, has a wingspan of and weighs . Males are all-black with a scarlet throat pouch that is inflated like a balloon in the breeding season. Although the feathers are black, the scapular feathers produce a purple iridescence when they reflect sunlight, in contrast to the male great frigatebird's green sheen. Females are black but have a white breast and lower neck sides, a brown band on the wings, and a blue eye- ring that is diagnostic of the female of the species. Immature birds have a white head and underparts. This species is very similar to the other frigatebirds and is similarly sized to all but the lesser frigatebird. However, it lacks a white axillary spur, and juveniles show a distinctive diamond-shaped belly patch. The magnificent frigatebird is silent in flight, but makes various rattling sounds at its nest. It spends days and nights on the wing, with an average ground speed of , covering up to before landing. They alternately climb in thermals, to altitudes occasionally as high as , and descend to near the sea surface. The only other bird known to spend days and nights on the wing is the common swift.

This nest is constructed out of branches and twigs. The magnificent frigatebird lays a clutch of one clear white egg that measures on average. This egg is incubated by both sexes for a period of 50 to 60 days. After the egg hatches, the male parent will abandon it, with the female staying to provision for the young for almost a year. Feeding This species feeds mainly on fish, squid, jellyfish and crustaceans. Individual bird diets vary depending on food availability and preferred hunting technique. It is a kleptoparasite, pecking at other seabirds to force them to disgorge their meals. After forcing the other seabird to regurgitate its meal, the magnificent frigatebird will dive and catch the prey before it hits the surface of the water. Genetics A scientific study which examined genetic and morphological variation in magnificent frigatebirds found both expected and also highly unexpected results. As predicted by the flight capacity of the species, the authors found signatures of high gene flow across most of the distribution range. This included evidence of recent gene flow among Pacific and Atlantic localities, likely across the Isthmus of Panama. This geological formation is a strong barrier to movement in most tropical seabirds. However, the same study also found that the magnificent frigatebird on the Gal√°pagos Islands is genetically and morphologically distinct. Based on this study, the Gal√°pagos population has not been exchanging any genes with their mainland counterparts for several hundred thousand years. Given these findings, the Gal√°pagos population of this tropical seabird may be a genetically distinct species warranting a separate conservation status. This small population of genetically unique magnificent frigatebirds is vulnerable. Any catastrophic event or threats by humans could wipe out the population of approximate two- thousand magnificent frigatebirds that nest on the Gal√°pagos Islands. Magnificent frigatebirds are currently classified as of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, but because of the genetic uniqueness of those on the Gal√°pagos Islands this may need to be revisited.

History  Conceptual rendering of the public information and visitor center at Sarasota National Cemetery, by C. M. Veloso There are six other national cemeteries in Florida, but the closest to the new location, Bay Pines National Cemetery, is closed to remains buried in caskets. The Veterans Administration was authorized to establish six new burial sites by the National Cemetery Expansion Act of 2003, enacted on November 11, 2003. Areas not served by an existing National Cemetery and having at least 170,000 veteran residents included: * Bakersfield, California * Birmingham, Alabama * Jacksonville, Florida * Sarasota County, Florida * Southeastern Pennsylvania * Columbia- Greenville, South Carolina Department of Veterans Affairs, Burial, and Memorials, New National Cemeteries Groundbreaking and dedication at the Sarasota site was held on June 1, 2008. The first interment was on January 9, 2009. Department of Veterans Affairs, National Cemetery Administration, Sarasota National Cemetery factsheet, January 2009  Site status  The plan for development of the facility is composed of three phases, but only the first phase has been funded, at $27.8 million to accommodate 25,000 burials. Initial construction on those began in June 2008 and created space for 18,200 casket burials within 15,200 designated crypts, 7,000 columbarium niches, and 500 in-ground cremations. The grounds were consecrated in December 2008, prior to the first burials. Phase one includes an entrance, roadways within the section, a public information center with restrooms, and two solar-powered shelters for committal services during inclement weather. Infrastructure consisting of drainage, landscaping, irrigation, and utilities also is being built. Permanent buildings for administration and maintenance were scheduled for completion in 2010.

A very comprehensive genus, in which it is rather difficult to define the species owing to the extraordinary resemblance among one another. Moreover, there are two series parallel to each other, one of which shows four white dots on the prothorax, the other exhibiting a white transverse streak instead. In order to facilitate the definition we keep to Mabille's division of the groups into \\"punctati\\" and \\"lineati\\". The Jemadia are robust insects with white or blue marking and hyaline (glass-like) spots. The hindwings are often remarkably small, in the males often with tooth-like projections on the inner-marginal and lower median vein, above them mostly with a deeply concave excision, and between the upper radial and subcostal vein often with an obtuse projection; more rarely the hindwings are quite round. The middle radial vein is absent, the lower one comes from the lower cell-angle, the upper median vein below it separately.Max Wilhelm Karl Draudt ,1924 Hesperiidae in Seitz.

It contains only one fossil species, Pamphilites abdita, recovered from the Tertiary of Aix-en-Provence, France. Discovery Pamphilites abdita was described in 1875 by the American entomologist and paleontologist Samuel Hubbard Scudder. The fossil was a single forewing recovered from the Lower Oligocene in Aix-en-Provence, France. The fossil wing is believed to have belonged to a female as it was lacking a prominent stigma (a patch of androconial scales). The type specimen, however, has since been lost. Taxonomy Based on the shape and venation of the fossil wing, Scudder classified it as belonging to the subfamily Hesperiinae of the skipper butterfly family (Hesperiidae).

Its members are Jimmy Monaghan (vocals, guitar) and D√≥nal Walsh (drums). Debut album and criticism In April, 2009, Music for Dead Birds released their debut album \\"And then it rained for seven days\\" on the Irish independent record label Rusted Rail. The album was self produced by the band and was mainly recorded using a 4-track tape deck. General reception of the album from critics was good, Foxy Digitalis commented : \\" The additional album info describes the recording as taking place in \\"various sheds, attics & bedrooms in Galway and Mayo.\\" The end result represents clear intentions and highly creative song writing and recording techniques.\\" However, it was also criticised for its lo-fi quality. The album currently has a 1.49 rating on Rate Your Music.http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/music_for_dead_birds The song Four Years From Now went on to feature on the soundtrack of the German Science Fiction movie Centerland, which was released by Jellyfant Records in 2013. \\"The Pope's Sister\\" In October 2011 the group released a new 10 track album titled \\"The Pope's Sister\\". The album was a departure from their usual, acoustic based sound. AU Magazine said : \\"Over ten short tracks ‚Äì each one as good as the next ‚Äì Jimmy Monaghan and co meld Beta Band-esque charm with boldly erratic time signatures and disaffected fuzz.\\" Terrascope also praised the album stating: \\"By the time you get to ‚ÄúRelease the Dogs‚Äù you find you are fully immersed in the album, the twisted guitar lines hooking you in with relentless ease.\\" It was listed by Irish radio DJ Dan Hegarty as one of the top 50 Irish albums of 2011. \\"Vitamins\\" The group's third album \\"Vitamins\\" was released on 17 April 2014, by the band's own Ghost Home Recordings label, as both a Pay what you want digital download and a limited edition CD run of 100 copieshttp://ballofwax.org/2014/06/ball-of-wax-36-songs-music-for-dead- birds-a-better-view/. The album was recorded in one weekend at Data Studios, County Kerry, with recording engineer Tadgh Healy.http://www.musicfordeadbirds.eu/2014/11/vitamins-recording-of.html Critical reception of the album was mixed, with Irish website Goldenplec.com referring to it as a \\"flawed project\\"https://www.goldenplec.com/album- reviews/music-dead-birds-vitamins-review/, while in a more positive review Ptolemaic Terrascope opined: \\"The sudden stop/starts, so beloved of Seattle residents, do sometimes get a little wearing, but it's never less than intriguing listening, and the good songs have their own chutzpah.\\"http://www.terrascope.co.uk/Reviews/Rumbles_August_14.htm Lead track The Farmer's Corn was broadcast by 2fm in Irelandhttp://www.rte.ie/2fm/dan- hegarty-the-alternative/programmes/2014/1215/666915-dan-hegarty-the- alternative-monday-15-december-2014/?clipid=1754500 and 2SER in Australia.

Pyrrhopyge in Adalbert Seitz's Macrolepidoptera of the World This genus comprises very numerous, partly extremely similar species which are difficult to separate and perhaps neither are separable as distinct species. Nearly all are large, strong animals with black body and wings, often with a bronze-green or deep blue lustre, often spotted red on the head and abdomen. On the broad, mostly pointed forewings the discoidal runs very obliquely, the upper median vein rising somewhat behind the middle of the cell. On the hindwing the lower radial and upper median vein rise unpetioled, the middle radial being absent. The hind tibiae are strongly haired outside. The Pyrrhopyge, according to statements by Adalbert Seitz, are conspicuous animals owing to their almost invariably one-coloured black colouring and the mostly glaring-red ends of their bodies. When they fly past swiftly, these red places are difficult to notice for the human eye, but the resting insect makes the impression as if its body were bleeding in front and behind. As the flight is impetuously swift, the animal escaping its enemies scarcely needs any protection, whereas on the topmost branches of bushes of 1 or 2 metres height, which are chosen by the males as their point of observation, one of the most dangerous enemies of the tropical butterflies is lying in ambush, the praying-cricket which even catches butterflies of the size of strong Papilio with a sure dart and is able to devour several large specimens a day. In the waiting attitude taken up by the Pyrrhopyge on the tip of the twig, the forewings are half erected, the hindwings somewhat more lowered; a position sometimes met with in European Adopaea or Pamphila, whereas other Pyrrhopyginae, such as the blue-striped Jemadia, the Mimoniades, Myscelus etc. keep their wings spread out when at rest, about like Thanaos tages. The larvae of Pyrrhopyge, as far as we know, are thinly haired on the body, shaggily on the head, brown or reddish with yellow, zebra-like stripes. They live on different trees, so on guava pear- trees (Psidium pyriferum and pomiferum), in leaf-cases. The pupae are haired, too. The imagines fly along the roads and skirts of woods in a raving, somewhat skipping flight and are fond of drinking from wet places on the roads. The Jemadia and Mimoniades love the umbels of blossoming bushes, where they are met with in the company of similarly coloured hesperids from other groups, such as Phocides and Pyrrhopygopsis.Max Wilhelm Karl Draudt ,1924 Hesperiidae in Seitz.

Both Ramachandran and party general secretary Jayalalithaa appointed him to various party roles from 1972, culminating in him becoming deputy general secretary of the party in 1996. Pandian was elected to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly as an AIADMK candidate from Alangulam constituency in the 1977 elections.1977 Tamil Nadu Election Results, Election Commission of India He was re-elected, this time from the Palayamkottai constituency, in the 1980 elections.1980 Tamil Nadu Election Results, Election Commission of India In 2000, Pandian was expelled from the AIADMK by Jayalalithaa. He joined the rival Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) on 2 May 2000, was given various posts by that party and had hopes of obtaining a state-level post within it. In the 2006 elections, he was successful in contesting as a DMK candidate in the Tenkasi constituency.2006 Tamil Nadu Election Results, Election Commission of India After being suspended from the DMK in May 2015 after allegedly attempting to have his son appointed to an official post within the party, Pandian remained silent for a while before being readmitted to the AIADMK on 26 July 2016 by Jayalalithaa. He had frequently severely criticised Jayalalithaa during his DMK member but after his expulsion had heaped praised upon her. After her death in December 2016, V. K.

Operation The M1914 is a time- delayed grenade. To activate it, the user must hold the grenade with the safety pin between two fingers, move the safety catch so that it is away from the hammer's front, then throw it. The safety pin is released as soon as the grenade is thrown. History Origins The M1914 is a heavily modified Model 1912 grenade. The head of the grenade went from a box to a cylinder, the wooden handle was removed in favor of a welded sheet of metal and the belt hook was removed. World War I The M1914 was one of the few grenades used the conflict that was in service before the war started. It was used throughout the war, along with the Stender grenade, by Russian forces until Russia withdrew from the conflict in 1917. Inter-war In 1930, the M1914 was modified to use a different explosive, TNT. TNT was a common explosive in Soviet grenades at the time, as seen in grenades such as the F1 grenade and RGD-33 grenade. World War II The M1914/30 also saw use in World War II, but it was eventually replaced by the RGD-33 grenade as the Soviet's primary stick grenade. The Axis forces used captured M1914/30 grenades, which they classified as the HG 336(r), or Handgranate 336 (russische). Post-World War II After World War II, the M1914 was completely retired in favor of other designs, such as the RGD-5 grenade. However, inert versions of the M1914 were used for training up until the 1980s. Variants M1914/30 The M1914/30 is a variant of the M1914 that uses TNT instead of Picric Acid. Otherwise, it is exactly the same as the M1914. M1917 Chemical The M1917 is a modified and larger M1914 that expels chemical gas when it \\"detonates\\". The primary chemical agent in this grenade is 500g of Chloropicrin, which is an irritant. The M1917 can be told apart from the M1914 because it is larger than the M1914 and has a skull and crossbones on it with the Russian word for chemical underneath the image. Fragmentation Sleeve The M1914 has an optional fragmentation sleeve that turns the M1914 into a fragmentation grenade. The sleeve's pattern was later used on the RGD-33 grenade's fragmentation sleeve.
