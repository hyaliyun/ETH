Life He was the son of Richard Spencer of Waldingfield One or other of the two sister villages of Great Waldingfield and Little Waldingfield. in Suffolk, came to London, and as a merchant was nicknamed \\"Rich Spencer\\". His trade with Spain, Turkey, and Venice was substantial, and he was accused in 1591 of engrossing, with two other merchants, the whole trade with Tripoli. Queen Elizabeth I is said to have visited him at Canonbury House in 1581, a property he bought from Thomas Wentworth, 2nd Baron Wentworth in 1570. Spencer was a member of the Clothworkers' Company, and was elected alderman of Langbourn ward on 9 August 1587. He served the office of sheriff of London in 1583‚Äì4, and that of lord mayor in 1594‚Äì5. During his shrievalty he was engaged in hunting down papists in and around Holborn and the adjoining localities, and had to justify before the council the committal of Anthony Bassano and others among her majesty's musicians. The end of 1594 was a time great scarcity prevailed, and Spencer sent his precept to the city companies to replenish their store of corn at the granaries in the Bridge House for sale to the poor. He resisted a demand by Admiral Sir John Hawkins for possession of the Bridge House for the use of the navy and baking biscuits for the fleet. Spencer kept his mayoralty at his town residence, Crosby Place in Bishopsgate Street, which he had purchased and restored (it had passed from Antonio Bonvisi to alderman William Bond, father of Martin Bond). In this sumptuous mansion during the course of 1604 Spencer entertained both the Duc de Sully (then M. de Rosny), while ambassador to England, and the youngest son of the Prince of Orange, with Barnevelt and Fulke, who came on a mission from Holland. Towards the close of his mayoralty he asserted the City of London's right, which it was feared the Crown would contest, to freely elect a recorder. Before the close of his mayoralty he received a knighthood. In May 1609 Spencer refused to contribute to an aid for James I on behalf of the young Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales; he also delayed his contribution of ¬£200. to the amount subscribed by the Clothworkers' Company to the Ulster settlement, which was paid by his executors. Spencer was president of St. Bartholomew's Hospital from 1603. Spencer died, at an advanced age, on 3 March 1610, and his widow only survived him till 27 March. He was buried on 22 March, and Dame Alice on 7 April, in his parish church of St Helen, Bishopsgate, where an altar tomb monument was placed to his memory. His funeral was on a most sumptuous scale. His fortune was variously estimated at very large sums, and the splendid inheritance is said for the time to have turned the brain of his son-in-law, Lord Compton. Among other estates, he possessed of the manors of Brooke Hall, Bower Hall, and Bocking, which he had obtained from the Queen on 1 August 1599. Spencer left nothing to public purposes. In Canonbury, a residential square which was laid out in 1963, is named after Sir John Spencer. He, at the time, was Lord Mayor of London and had a country retreat at Canonbury in the early 17th Century. John Spencer Square had former residents include Labour Party Cabinet Minister Barbara Castle and her husband Ted Castle, journalist and GLC Alderman. Family By his wife, Alice Bromfield, Spencer had an only child, Elizabeth, who in 1598 was sought in marriage by William Compton, 2nd Lord Compton. Spencer strongly disapproved of the match, but Compton's influence at court enabled him to procure Spencer's imprisonment in the Fleet Prison in March 1599 for ill- treating his daughter. The young lady was ultimately carried off by her lover from Canonbury Tower in a baker's basket. The marriage quickly followed, but Spencer gave his daughter no marriage portion. When, in May 1601, his daughter became a mother, he showed no signs of relenting. But some reconciliation apparently took place soon afterwards, it is said, through the intervention of Elizabeth.

It depicts the residents of a small town who become infected with a bacterium that has fallen to Earth from space. It was produced by Two Thirds Productions. Plot The film opens with a man in a medical containment suit running through the forest. He is chased by another man who is covered in blood and screaming. The man in the hazard suit falls and hides behind a log, watching as the bloodied man clutches his head before the back of his skull explodes. The movie then tracks back forty hours earlier, showing a woman named Brooke jogging in the woods. She is joined by local deputy Max, and the two make love in the woods. Elsewhere, a small group of military men set up a mobile missile launcher on the side of a hill. The men have been tasked with shooting down an orbiting satellite with a missile. As the missile is launched, the satellite is struck by a meteorite and explodes, with the meteorite continuing on and striking the Earth. Brooke returns home and meets with her parents, while Max heads back to the sheriff's office. There he learns from fellow deputy Davidson that the meteorite has caused a brush fire. Davidson tells him that the military advised them to avoid the area due to possible chemical contamination, but the fire department is dispatched to dig fire breaks and contain the area. One of the firefighters discovers a piece of satellite wreckage with an odd green ooze attached to it and picks it up; later he is shown becoming ill. That evening Brooke's friend Karen and her boyfriend Chad are spending an evening together when Karen's daughter becomes frightened by a bloodied man walking in their yard. Chad goes out to investigate and doesn't return, prompting Karen to investigate. She comes across his severely mutilated corpse in the yard, which is examined the next morning by Davidson. A preliminary autopsy performed by Davidson, who is also the town's physician, determines that Chad was killed and eaten by more than one human. He also discovers that Chad's hypothalamus is growing at an exponential rate despite his being dead. Davidson then discovers a bacterium in the corpse he has never seen before, prompting him to speculate that the bacterium is the result of interplanetary contamination. Brooke rides her bike home from town and discovers a horde of bloodied strangers attacking her family. The attackers act like zombies, chasing down and feeding on anyone they encounter. The infected kill Brooke's mom and brother before she manages to escape. Her father also makes it out, deciding to jog into town. Max encounters the infected at a campsite and is forced to abandon his patrol car and walk back to the sheriff's office. He meets up with a battered Davidson, who is attacked and bitten. During the melee, Davidson bites Max on his leg and apparently infects him as well. Brooke stumbles across the military man in the hazard suit shown in the beginning and together they make it back to the armored vehicles. Brooke uses a satellite phone to alert the military to the danger before being forced to flee alone. An infected Max drives another police cruiser out of town and crashes it on the side of the road. He climbs into the back, trapping himself in the car. Brooke finds the cruiser and gets inside, where Max confesses his love for her and shows her an engagement ring he bought for her. The infected surround the cruiser and attempt to get in. When they break the windows to the back, Brooke and Max decide to try and fight their way out. The movie ends as the two rush out of the cruiser shooting, leaving the viewer to speculate as to their fate.

Behat Bibi and Dehat Bibi were daughters of a Kashmiri pundit who was a village Patwari by profession and had converted to Islam under the influence of the Sufi saint. The exalted state of their spirituality and the depth and breadth of their knowledge is testified by the fact that the two girls became the only known female khalifas of Nund Reshi.

The martyrs The catacomb is especially known to have Pancras from Phrygia, a famous martyr, buried within its walls. Pancras was entrusted to his uncle Dionysus at age 8,after his parents died, and they both came to Rome. Saint Pancras converted to Christianity while in Rome and at the age of 14, he was beheaded in May 304 AD (around 303 AD Christians were being persecuted for their faith) when he refused to sacrifice to the gods. Before Diocletian, emperor at the time, was impressed with how young Pancras was and how he had the courage to refuse sacrificing to the Gods, so he offered Pancras money and power to leave the Christian faith, but Pancras still refused so he was beheaded and thrown to the side. His body was abandoned on the Via Aurelia and was picked up by a Christian matrona, Ottavilla, who buried him. Ottavilla found the body and the head on May 12 304 AD, she picked them up, wrapped Pancras in precious linen and buried him specifically in the Catacombs that stood there. His head was eventually placed in a precious manner in the Basilica, the body lays in an urn and the site still reads \\"Hic decollatus fuit Sanctus Pancratius\\" (Here San Pancrazio was taken off) \\". His body now rests among other martyrs buried in the Catacombs. The ancient sources, particularly the Medieval itineraries for pilgrims, mention other martyrs buried within the catacomb: Artemy, Paulinus, Sophia and her three daughters Faith, Hope and Charity. The resting place of the last four martyrs can probably be identified with the so-called cubicle of St. Sophia. The cult of St. Pancras highly spread during the Middle Ages, so much so that the catacomb bearing his name was one of the few in Rome that could always be visited by the pilgrims. The once di Calepodio cemetery, where Pancras was buried, changed its name to the Catacombs of San Pancrazio. The first notice about the martyrdom of Pancras comes from the Martyrologium Hieronymianum, that sets the date of the death at 12 May. History Between the end of the 4th century and the beginning of the 5th, Pope Symmachus built a basilica above the catacomb consecrated to the martyr and a thermal edifice. In 594 Gregory the Great provided the basilica with a cloister. In 625 Pope Honorius I rebuilt the basilica after a Greek-Gothic war, with three naves. Pope Honorius' rebuilding is the basilica that still exists today. As mentioned above, San Pancrazio is one of the few catacombs in Rome whose track has not been completely lost during the centuries, even if it has often been confused with other catacombs rising along the Via Aurelia. Antonio Bosio thoroughly studied the cemetery, but he confused it with the cemetery of Calepodius; the two catacombs were distinguished by Giovanni Battista de Rossi in the 19th century. Excavations carried out at the beginning of the 1930s under the floor of the Basilica of San Pancrazio led to the discovery of a Roman street that cut in two, diagonally to the church; they also brought to light some mausolea and ground graves, both inside the basilica and in its square, such demonstrating that the hypogeous cemetery also included an extended funerary area on the topsoil. Topography and description The Catacomb of San Pancrazio is not in the most perfect condition: the tunnels are mostly destroyed and therefore the visit to see the Catacomb is very short. The hypogeous cemetery can be divided into three main regions: *The first region is placed below the left transept of the basilica and behind the apse and its access is still the former entrance, within the left nave. This region was explored in the first half of the 20th century by Father Fusciardi. *In the right nave, a trapdoor gives access to the second region, placed below the square in front of the basilica. In this region it is possible to visit: The cubicle of Botrys, from the name of the decedent buried in it. The peculiarity of this grave is that, on his headstone, Botrys declares himself as a christian√≥s, an unusual expression in the Christian graveyards. The cubicle of Saint Felix, dating back to the end of the 3rd and the beginning of the 4th century, decorated with a linear red style and elements referring to the sea (ships and fishes). The cubicle of Saint Sophia, housing a white-plastered arcosolium with four graves, that are believed to be the martyr Sophia and her three daughters'. *Finally, the third region is placed below the cloister. Within the third region there are widespread Constantinian Christograms, which lead the researchers to believe that this part of the hypogeous cemetery has been built in the 4th century.

He only placed third in the hammer at that year's national championships, losing to two other Rhode Island State alumni, William Rowe and Folwartshny. However, at the Olympic Trials, which were held separately the following week, he threw 171 ft in (52.41 m) and won by two inches over Rowe, qualifying for the Olympics in Berlin. He placed ninth at the Olympics, throwing 165 ft 5 in (50.42 m). √∑‚Äî‚Äì143+305*70 =Championship streak and 1948 Olympics= Dreyer won no national titles in 1937 or 1938, finishing second to Folwartshny in the indoor weight throw in both years. He regained the indoor weight throw title in 1939; in 1940 he finished second to Niles Perkins, but won the outdoor 56-pound weight throw for the first time, throwing 35 ft 6 in (10.82 m). He won seven consecutive national titles in the indoor weight throw from 1941 to 1947, a streak that remained unparalleled until Lance Deal won eight times in a row starting in 1989. Dreyer also won the outdoor weight throw in 1945 and the hammer throw in 1943, 1944 and 1945. Dreyer's indoor weight throw streak ended in the Olympic year of 1948, when he placed third as Bob Bennett won and Sam Felton took second. However, he regained the outdoor title; his throw of 41 ft in (12.56 m) exceeded Matt McGrath's old world record of 40 ft in (12.32 m) from 1911, but the implement used was found to have been too light. He also qualified for his second Olympics in the hammer throw, placing third at the national championships (again behind Bennett and Felton) and second at the final Olympic Trials in Evanston, where he threw 173 ft in (52.85 m) and defeated Felton. At the Olympics in London Dreyer finished ninth, just as he had twelve years before; this time his best throw was 168 ft in (51.37 m), three feet better than in Berlin. =Later career= In 1949 Dreyer successfully defended his outdoor weight throw title. He also set his personal hammer best of 183 ft 3 in (55.87 m) and placed second to Felton at the national championships with 175 ft in (53.50 m). Track & Field News ranked him eighth among the world's hammer throwers that year, the only time he made the top ten as the rankings were first compiled in 1947. Dreyer reached career-best form with the 56-pound outdoor weight in 1951; at the Metropolitan championships in June he threw 41 ft in (12.68 m), again breaking the world record and now legitimately, although as the IAAF didn't recognize official weight throw world records it was only ratified as an American record. He also won the national championship, throwing 41 ft in (12.66 m), a meeting record. In the hammer throw he placed second to Felton, throwing 182 ft in (55.68 m), his best mark ever at the national championships. He won a final national title with the 56-pound weight in 1952, throwing 40 ft in (12.27 m). His attempt to qualify for a third Olympic Games was not successful as, although he threw 173 ft in (52.82 m) at the 1952 Olympic Trials, it was only good enough for sixth place.

There is also a branch of the Palatinate museum, the GEOSCOPE Prehistoric Museum (GEOSKOP Urweltmuseum) at Lichtenberg Castle near the West Palatine county town of Kusel. Both establishments are run by the Palatinate District Association (Bezirksverband Pfalz), the town of Bad D√ºrkheim and the counties of Bad D√ºrkheim and Kusel.  Geography  The Palatinate Museum is located in a former mill, the Herzogm√ºhle on the Herzogweiher, a reservoir on the River Isenach in the Bad Durkheim ward of Grethen.  Exhibitions and education  Since 1981 the museum has exhibited the natural science collection of the Pollichia nature conservation society as well as a permanent exhibition and changing exhibitions with scientific themes. In 2008 there was an expansion: after the renovation of the former mill restaurant and the erection of an extension to the building the new entrance area and rooms for special exhibitions were officially opened on 8 November 2008. The fields of science covered include astronomy, herpetology (reptiles), ornithology and mineralogy. There is a comprehensive range of educational packages for visiting groups and school classes. Next to the museum shop there is a palaeontological workshop and geological reference library. Amongst its best known exhibits is the Kr√§henberg meteorite which impacted on the Sickingen Heights in 1869.  Prehistoric museum  Rear of the GEOSCOPE Prehistoric Museum In 1998 the GEOSCOPE Prehistoric Museum was opened at Lichtenberg Castle near Kusel. With a floor area of 400 square metres, the museum offers an insight into the Rotliegendes period about 290 million years ago. At that time the southern and northern continental plates collided in this region, producing the Variscan mountains, and a moist-warm tropical climate prevailed. Another major subject in the exhibition area is mining in the North Palatine Uplands with special coverage of the living and working conditions of the miners. Mineral deposits, including copper and mercury-bearing ores, have been mined here from Celtic and Roman times right up to the start of the 20th century.

Life Born at Derby in 1790, he was the son of Matthew Spencer (1762‚Äì1827), schoolmaster at Derby, by his wife Catherine Taylor; Thomas Spencer (1796‚Äì1853) was his younger brother. He was educated at his father's school in Derby. After assisting his father he began, at the age of 17, to take private pupils in algebra, Euclid, astronomy, physics, and other mathematical subjects, and continued to teach throughout life. As an educator he was noted as a follower of Johann Pestalozzi, and for his teaching of girls, who made up at least half of his students, without difference of syllabus. Illness forced him to give up school teaching around 1825, however, and he moved to Nottingham, taking up the lace business. He then returned to Derby, to work as a tutor. Spencer acted as secretary to the Derby Philosophical Society. A dissenter who had quarrelled with the local Methodists, he attended a Quaker meeting-house. He died in March 1866. Works Page from Inventional Geometry (1860) by William George Spencer In Inventional Geometry (1860), Spencer taught elementary geometry by a gradual transition from the concrete to the abstract, a method now considered to have been at least a generation ahead of its time.

The case has not been solved. Biography A native of Dublin, Dunne was a member of the Sisters of St. Louis in Middletown, County Armagh, where she was deputy assistant director of the St Joseph's Training School run by the order. Death On the afternoon of 24 July 1990, the 37-year-old nun was driving an Austin Metro car with a passenger, Cathy McCann, a 25-year-old social worker. Some hours previously, members of the IRA took over a house close to Killylea Road, two miles outside Armagh, County Armagh, holding its occupants, a married couple and their children, at gunpoint. A detonating wire was placed from the house to a 1,000-pound bomb, placed in a culvert under Killylea Road,. At approximately 2 p.m., as Dunne's car was driving to Armagh, a Royal Ulster Constabulary patrol car was traveling in the opposite direction. Dunne's car passed by the patrol car just as the police drove over the culvert, at which point the IRA detonated the bomb. Constable William James Hanson (37), and reserve officers Joshua Cyril Willis (35) and David Sterritt (34), were all killed instantly; their car was blown into the air and landed upside down. Dunne and McCann were both severely injured. Dunne later died of her injuries. Witness Paul Corr, owner of a petrol filling station nearby, said, \\"The ground shook beneath us and it was accompanied by a very large explosion. At first we did not see the police car. The whole place was a terrible mess. Then we saw two young girls in the [Austin Metro]. They were unconscious and looked in a pretty bad way. There was nothing we could do for the policemen. Nobody could have come out of that car alive. It was dreadful.\\" The bomb left a 6-foot-diameter crater in the two-lane road. Reaction Sister Fiona Fullham, a regional superior of the Sisters of St. Louis, said, \\"I would pray that all those in Northern Ireland who have been involved in violence would try to think of the human face of the people who have died and who are dying, and of the families who are suffering needlessly all these years ... I would say, please stop. Please stop.\\" Sister Catherine was remembered as an athletic and lively woman, who was an enthusiastic jogger and swimmer. Taoiseach Charles Haughey was quoted as saying, \\"I know all the people of Ireland join me in my condemnation of this atrocity.\\" The IRA released a message claiming responsibility for the attack, and called Dunne a victim of \\"unforeseen and fluke circumstances.\\" The statement was rejected in advance by political and Catholic and Protestant leaders alike and politicians in Ireland and Great Britain. Sinn F√©in's Martin McGuinness said, \\"Our sorrow at these deaths is genuine and profound, but will be abused by our political opponents who will cynically exploit yesterday's events for their own political purpose.\\" Pope John Paul II sent a message to be read at Catherine's funeral in which he condemned the \\"grievous injustice and futility\\" of the murders that left him \\"deeply shocked and saddened.\\" He implored \\"the men and women who espouse violence to recognise the grievous injustice and futility of terrorism.\\" References External links * Troubles Chronology: Catherine Dunne 1950s births 1990 deaths Irish murder victims People from Dublin (city) People killed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army Murder victims from Northern Ireland People murdered in Northern Ireland Irish Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns Date of birth missing 1990 murders in the United Kingdom ","title":"Catherine Dunne (bombing victim)"},{"id":"42567171","title":"2014‚Äì15 Eastern Michigan Eagles men's basketball team"},{"id":"42567182","title":"Keep It to Yourself (Kacey Musgraves song)"},{"id":"42567189","text":"Jo√£o Gomes de Oliveira commonly known as Filh√£o (born 16 June 1995) is an Angolan professional footballer who plays as a forward for Recreativo do Libolo.

It was the second IRA attack in West Germany that week, a previous one resulting in two British soldiers shot near M√ºnster. In a statement released in Dublin the following day, the IRA said: > An IRA Active Service Unit carried out last night's shooting in West > Germany.

This warning applies to > the use of vehicles personally belonging to British soldiers and all modes > of military transport. Sinn F√©in President Gerry Adams responded to civilians that had been recently killed by the IRA, such as Hazell, husband and wife James and Ellen Sefton, Islania Niurati the six-month-old child of a British soldier in Germany, and teenager Terry Love, saying: > There can be no doubt where Sinn Fein stands on actions which lead to the > deaths of civilians or injuries to civilians.

She was Principal of St Hugh's College, Oxford from 1924 to 1946. Early life and education Gwyer was born on 1 January 1881 in Marylebone, London, England. Her parents were John Edward Gwyer and Edith Gwyer (n√©e Linford), and she had a brother, Sir Maurice Gwyer. She was educated at the Grove School, an all-girls school in Highgate, Middlesex. In 1900, she matriculated into Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford to study classics. She achieved a second class in Mods in 1902, and a second class in Literae Humaniores in 1904. However, she could not graduate as at the time the University of Oxford only gave degrees to men. In 1920, when the statutes were changed, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) and the Oxford MA. Career Having completed her degree in 1904, Gwyer worked as a secretary for two years. From 1906 to 1908, she was an educational organiser for the West Riding County Council's educational department. Gwyer then moved into overseeing female students at university, an area where she would spend the rest of her career. From 1910 to 1916, she was Vice-Warden of Ashburne Hall, a hall of residence for women at the Victoria University of Manchester. From 1917 to 1924, she was Warden of University Hall, Leeds. From 1924 to 1946, she served as Principal of St Hugh's College, Oxford. Later life Following her retirement in 1946, Gwyer was made an honorary fellow of St Hugh's College, Oxford. She lived for the rest of her life in Stokenchurch, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, but was a regular visitor to St Hugh's. In old age, she became frail and used a wheelchair: she was described by Barbara Castle, who had studied at St Hugh's College, Oxford, as \\"a frail, gentle figure in a wheelchair‚Äîaeons away from the ogre I had known when she was principal\\". She died on 16 February 1974, aged 93.

It is found in shallow waters in the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean. Sometimes growing as long as , it is one of the longest sea cucumbers in the world. Description S. maculata is a long, slender sea cucumber with fifteen tentacles, growing to a length of about . Although not the heaviest or bulkiest sea cucumber in the world, it is probably the longest, with individuals exceptionally reaching to over . Its colouring is variable, being some shade of yellowish-brown with wide longitudinal stripes and patches of darker colour. The spicules (microscopic calcareous spike-like structures that support the body wall) are large and shaped like anchors and are used in locomotion; they can be as long as 2 mm. The spicules are adhesive, and the sea cucumber is very difficult to detach from a wetsuit. Distribution and habitat The species is native to the tropical western Indo-Pacific region. It occurs at depths down to about on reefs and on soft sediments on the seabed among seagrasses and seaweeds. It can also bury itself under rubble. Biology Tentacles surround the mouth The tentacles of Synapta maculata surround the mouth and are used in surface feeding. They are about long when extended and have a short stem and a feather-like blade with thirty to forty pairs of pinnules. The outer surfaces of the tentacles have numerous bulges and are adhesive while the inner surfaces are smooth, with clusters of cilia on the proximal parts. The tentacles are in continuous motion; they flatten themselves against the substrate or seagrass leaf blades and collect food particles by adhesion, then bend inwards until the tips are in the mouth, where the food is scraped off by the buccal sphincter muscle. The whole process takes only a few seconds, and several tentacles can deliver their loads at the same time. If the animal is disturbed, the tentacles can contract back into the pharynx, but before long they are out again, collecting more particles. The outer surface of the tentacles bears numerous vesicular cells, and there are a few scattered vesicles on the body surface also. The function of these cells is unclear, but it is suggested that they may contain a noxious substance and serve a defensive function. The tentacles are particularly vulnerable to predation by fish, but if they taste nasty, that enables the sea cucumber to spend a greater proportion of its time feeding, rather than having to keep retracting its tentacles whenever a fish approaches. There are also some cup-shaped structures on the inside of the tentacles near the stem. It is hypothesized that these are rudimentary sensory organs, able to taste the edibility of the food material that the animal is transporting to its mouth. A defensive response made by many sea cucumbers is evisceration, but in the case of S. maculata, autotomy is preferred, with large individuals dispensing with sections near the rear end while smaller individuals break into many pieces. Two previously unknown triterpene holostane glycosides have been isolated from S. maculata; one has moderate activity against HeLa tumour cells while the other is inactive. In literature Naturalist Gerald Durrell's 1977 observations of this creature were made when he was snorkeling in shallow water in Mauritius: \\"At first, I could not believe that these weird objects were alive. I thought they must be strange, dead strands of some deep-sea seaweed now washed into the shallows by the tide, to roll and undulate helplessly on the sand to the small movements of the sea. Closer inspection showed me that they were indeed alive, unlikely though it seemed. Sinucta muculata, as this strange creature is called, is really a sort of elongated tube, which sucks in water at one end and with it microscopic organisms, and expels the water at the other.\\" References External links * Synaptidae Biota of Mauritius Fauna of the Indian Ocean Animals described in 1821 ","title":"Synapta maculata"},{"id":"42567657","title":"Off Color Brewing"},{"id":"42567711","text":"The Medal for Distinguished Conduct and Loyal Service is a South African military medal which was instituted by the Republic in 1987.

Her work takes traditional artistic media such as drawing, painting and sculpture and pushes their limits as a scientific experimentation with art making.  Biography  Analia Saban was born and grew up in Buenos Aires, Argentina. She always knew that she wanted to be an artist: \\"This is what I was born to do,‚Äù she says. Saban earned her B.F.A in Visual Arts from Loyola University New Orleans and her M.F.A in New Genres from UCLA. She studied under the artist John Baldessari and now works in his former Santa Monica studio. Work Saban often works with materials in ways that confuse or subvert their typical meaning or use in studio art practice. She describes her method of working as artistic, scientific, and archeological, due to her awareness of the larger social implications of her material and object-based inquiries. Of her work, Saban has said \\"I like to work as unconsciously as I can, letting ideas take over my production. I try to avoid ‚Äúforcing‚Äù the creative process. I try to keep a constant level of experimentation, but sometimes I also have to sit, look at previous work, or experiments, or the empty wall, and wait..\\" She seeks to redefine the traditional notions of painting by utilizing the medium of paint as the subject of her work. Some of Saban's more well known projects have involved completely unraveling a painted canvas and re-weaving the threads into scarves or rolling them into a \\"Painting Ball,\\" bending slabs of marble or concrete and draping them over sawhorses, and printing plastic bags out of hand-made cotton paper. She is the winner of the Norton Museum's 2012 \\"Rudin Prize For Emerging Photographers\\". Saban's work has been exhibited widely both nationally and internationally and are represented in the collections of the Allen Memorial Art Museum of Oberlin College, the Hessel Museum of Art at Bard College, the Hammer Museum at UCLA in Los Angeles, Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, Norton Museum of Art in Florida, and Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

The cinema is the property of Aberdeen City Council, and it is run by the Centre for the Moving Image. History The building was constructed in 1896 as a trades hall to a design by architects, Alexander Ellis and Robert Gordon Wilson. The first film was shown on the premises in 1898, and featured footage of Queen Victoria at Balmoral Castle, establishing a tradition of hosting visiting cinema shows. In 1910, the Trades Hall was converted into a permanent cinema called the Coliseum. It was refurbished and reopened as the New Kinema in 1921. After another refurbishment in 1935, it was renamed the Belmont Cinema. It closed in 1953, and the building was converted into a warehouse. It reopened under lease to Picturehouse Cinemas as the Belmont Picturehouse in September 2000, after a major refurbishment by Aberdeen City Council with assistance from the National Lottery and Scottish Screen. After some turmoil and uncertainty, the lease for exploitation on the Belmont to Picturehouse had been extended in April 2011 for a further ten years. However, with the purchase of Picturehouse Cinemas by Cineworld, the company were forced to sell the Belmont due to a ruling by the Competition Commission that it had created unfair competition in the city.

Early life Born in Monkstown, County Dublin, Ireland, Rua developed his interest in magic at the age of 18. He had previously worked as a fire performer, and after a freak accident suffered second- and third- degree burns to his hands, face and chest. While he was in hospital, he was given a book on card tricks by a friend, through which he developed his interest in sleight of hand. Rua holds a BA Honours Degree in Communication Studies, and a master's degree in Film and Television Studies from Dublin City University. Television career Rua's television career began in 2012 when he started filming his debut series Dra√≠ocht for Irish national broadcaster TG4, with Midas Productions, the company that was originally behind Irish Hypnotist Keith Keith Barry's debut TV series in 2003. This 10-part series was the first Irish-language magic series to be broadcast in Ireland, and the first Irish television series that featured an escapologist.

Her uncanny objects interrogate the production of desire and the exchange of meaning in an image- based society. Discussing a group show in 2007, New York Times Art Writer Holland Cotter noted, \\"An installation by Lisa Lapinski carries a hefty theory- studies title: 'Christmas Tea-Meeting, Presented by Dialogue and Humanism, Formerly Dialectics and Humanism.' But the piece itself just looks breezily enigmatic.\\" It is often remarked that viewers of Lapinski's sculptures are enticed into an elaborate set of ritualistic decodings. In a review of her work published in ArtForum, Michael Ned Holte noted, \\"At such moments, it becomes clear that Lapinski's entire systemic logic is less circular than accumulative: What at first seems hermetically sealed is often surprisingly generous upon sustained investigation.\\" Lapinski's work has been exhibited widely in the US and Europe, and she was included in the 2006 Whitney Biennial.  Life and career  Lapinski received an MFA from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena in 2000 and a BA in Philosophy from University of California in 1990. She also attended an advanced course in visual arts taught by Haim Steinbach in Como, Italy in 1999. Her work is included in public collections that include the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; the Rubell Family Collection; and the Contemporary Arts Foundation, Miami. She received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2004 and participated in the 2006 Whitney Biennial exhibition, Day for Night, curated by Chrissie Iles and Philippe Vergne. Lapinski received the American Center Foundation grant for exhibition at Midway Contemporary Art, Minneapolis, Minnesota in 2007. Lapinski has studied and worked internationally, with exhibitions in Japan, Milan, Los Angeles, and New York.  Work  In response to Lapinski's exhibition at MOCA in 2008, curator Bennett Simpson writes, \\"Throughout her work, Lapinski has made [...] symbolic iconography an important part of her lexicon. The prevalence of faces, cartoon silhouettes, swastikas, Stars of David, Christian crosses, corporate logotypes, and many less specific geometric figures (circles, triangles, checkerboards, and frets), which themselves contain symbolism of nature, science, or machinery, lend her sculptures and drawings a representational dimension that teeters between scientific reference and abstract decoration.\\" Lapinski's work uses a variety of medium including word, wire, cement, and clay in addition to painting, photography, drawing, and found material with work often containing philosophical and historical references. With an unorthodox formalism and style, she uses the history and uncertain narratives of objects to create new meaning. Lapinski states, \\"I don't think any material dies.\\" Solo exhibitions Recent exhibitions of works by Lapinski include: * 2001: Untitled (Rimbaud), Richard Telles Fine Art, Los Angeles * 2003: Analysandom, Richard Telles Fine Art, Los Angeles * 2003: Speech Model from the Flies; Fruits of Crime; Goose Fair (with Catherine Sullivan), Galerie Mezzanin, Vienna * 2004: Fine Evening Sir!, Johann K√∂nig, Berlin * 2004: Goose Fair, Studio Guenzani, Milan * 2005: Bit by Bit, Kim Light Gallery / LightBox Gallery (inaugural exhibition), Los Angeles * 2007: When Things Collapse, Praz-Delavallade, Paris, France * 2007: Wet Paintings in the Womb, Spr√ºth Magers Projekte, Munich, Germany * 2007: Linz Wedding Song, Midway Contemporary Art, Minneapolis, Minnesota * 2008: Richard Telles Fine Art, Los Angeles, CA * 2008: Lisa Lapinski, The Fret and Its Variants (curated by Bennet Simpson) * 2008: MOCA, Los Angeles * 2009: Light Breaks Out of Prism, Thomas Solomon Gallery, Los Angeles * 2009: Living Color, Praz-Delavallade, Paris, France * 2009: Sch√ºrmann Berlin * 2010: Froing and Toing, Light and Wire Gallery * 2010: Information Leaks, Josh Lilley Gallery, London * 2011: Dig, Praz-Delavallade, Paris, France * 2011: Derrames, 11x7 Galeria, Buenos Aires, Argentina * 2011: Grayscale, Thomas Solomon Gallery, Los Angeles * 2012: Gag, Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, New York City * 2013: Bathroom Sink, etc, Spr√ºth Magers, Berlin * 2013: Datum, Josh Lilley Gallery, London References  * 1967 births 20th-century artists 20th-century American sculptors Artists from Los Angeles Living people Sculptors from California ","title":"Lisa Lapinski"},{"id":"42568035","text":"Louis L.

Background Born and reared in Poplarville in Pearl River County in southwestern Mississippi, Smith in 1977 obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in Religion from William Carey College in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. He subsequently procured a Master of Divinity and a Ph.D. from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, where while in New Orleans, he was thereafter for fourteen years the J. D. Grey professor of preaching at the seminary. Smith is the author of three ministerial books: *Holy Gatherings: A Leader's Guide for Engaging the Congregation in Corporate Worship *Interpersonal Relationship Skills for Ministers *Helping Hurting People: A Handbook on Reconciliation-Focused Counseling and Preaching. Before he came to Louisiana College in 2011, Smith was the pastor of the First Baptist Church of Biloxi, Mississippi. He came to LC as Dean of Chapel and Associate Dean of Pastoral Ministry for the Caskey School of Divinity, an entity endowed by the Coushatta businessman Edgar Cason, who has since withdrawn funding for the school and entered into an arrangement with New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, Smith's former institution. Smith and his wife, the former Connie Kathleen Saucier, also a native of Poplarville, married in 1975, both at the age of twenty. They have three grown sons, Joshua, David, and Dustin Smith. Tapped as interim LC president At the time he was chosen as interim president, Smith wore four titles at LC: the executive vice president, the associate dean for Christian ministry at the Caskey School, the vice president for the integration of faith and learning, and professor of preaching and pastoral ministry. Smith succeeded Joe W. Aguillard, whose latter tenure was shaken by a series of controversies, including a claim that Calvinism was being promoted on the Baptist campus, questions about forged documents submitted to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the failure to finish the Paul Pressler Law School under construction in Shreveport, and the diversion of $60,000 from the Caskey School of Divinity to an LC missions project in Tanzania. The events led to the call of a student strike against Aguillard. Though the strike at first appeared unsuccessful, on March 27, 2014, it was reported that the LC trustees had asked Aguillard to resign. On April 15, 2014, the trustees named Aguillard president emeritus beginning August 1, with Smith tapped at that same time as the interim president, pending a job search for a permanent holder of the position. Aguillard will remain as president until May 31, at which time Smith will for two months assume the temporary title of \\"president pro tempore\\". Aguillard will assist Smith in the transition of administration and may after a year of paid leave beginning in 2015 resume his former tenured professorship in the LC Graduate Teacher Education program. Smith told a meeting in Shreveport of LC alumni that the college must rebuild trust within Baptist ranks. \\"I don‚Äôt have a vision for a long-term future. I have a mandate to make sure we get ready for the arrival of the new president,‚Äù he said. Two in the audience questioned whether the search committee would act independently of the trustee. On June 19, 2014, the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools at its annual meeting in San Antonio, Texas, placed Louisiana College on probation because of issues related to trustee board governance, institutional integrity, personnel policies, and audit findings regarding both student financial aid and other financial control matters. Smith said that the decision by SACS is \\"disappointing\\" but \\"represents an opportunity for Louisiana College to address the issues in preparation for the arrival of a new president. Fortunately, the issues don't bring into question in any way the excellent classroom work being done by our professors and students. The issues have to do with administrative areas.\\"John Willie, \\"Louisiana College Placed on Probation by SACS-Commission on Colleges; Maintains Full Accreditation\\", Louisiana College press release, June 19, 2014 In November 2014, President Smith disclosed that Louisiana College has a $1 million shortfall for the 2014‚Äì2015 academic year. The 2014 enrollment of 1,265 is 141 fewer than in the fall of 2013. A decrease of 141 students, according to Smith, represents a loss of $2.1 million in revenues from tuition and fees paid by students, double the overall budgetary shortfall. Smith said that the institution will attempt to control expenditures but not cut jobs or contracts. Major projects under former President Joe Aguillard will be suspended, including a school in Tanzania, a law school in Shreveport to have been named in honor of former Texas Judge Paul Pressler of Houston, and a medical school and film school in Central Louisiana. Smith was succeeded as president by Rick Brewer, a former administrator at Charleston Southern University in North Charleston, South Carolina, who was the unanimous choice of the LC trustees.

It was obliterated by the development of the Blair Athol coal mine. History Early settler James MacLaren took up a pastoral run in the area in 1863 and named it Blair Athol after the village Blair Atholl, the location of Blair Castle of the Duke of Atholl in Scotland. While sinking a well in 1864, he discovered coal on the property. By 1873, early shafts were dug, revealing extensive seams of coal. At that time, around 100 people were living in the town and there was a hotel, although no township had been officially surveyed. The town was surveyed in 1878. Blair Athol Provisional School opened on 6 November 1893. It became a State School in 1909. Blair Athol Post Office opened on 1 July 1927 (a receiving office had been open from 1910) and closed in 1966. On 18 May 1922, the Queensland Governor Matthew Nathan officially opened Australia's first open cut mine at Blair Athol. By the 1970s, it became apparent that there were significant coal seams under the town. In order to construct an open cut mine, the town had to be sacrificed. The school closed on 31 December 1974. In 1981 a reunion was held at the community hall to mark the final end of the town, following which all of the town was demolished. Only the cemetery remains.

To celebrate Nightfever one must be trained by the Nightfever international team to receive permission. History Nightfever was founded by students Katharina Fassler-Maloney, a member of the Emmanuel Community, and Andreas S√º√ü, then a seminarian and today a priest. After World Youth Day 2005 in Cologne the pair thought, \\"This cannot be the end. This great vibe/spirit of the WYD has to go on in our daily lives‚Ä¶!\\" Only one event was originally planned, but due to its success it was continued, and then spread across Germany, Europe, and beyond. The first Nightfever in North America was held in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 2012. On Saturday nights volunteers stand on streets near bars, theaters, and parties in city centers. They approach strangers and say things such as \\"Hey, want a candle? We‚Äôre praying for peace.\\" If the passerby agrees they are welcomed into the church, or the volunteer walks them to nearby church where the event is taking place. Participants are welcome to light their candle and leave, or to stay and pray for as short or as long of a time as they like. When they leave, \\"their candles burn on as a symbol of their concerns and thoughts.\\" In addition to lighting candles at the altar, common elements inside the church include the Eucharistic exposed for adoration, contemporary Christian music, submitting prayer intentions, and priests on hand to administer the Sacrament of Reconciliation or to provide prayer, support, and counsel. Nightfever typically goes late into the night. As they leave, participants are often given items to take with them. In New York, it is small cards thanking them for coming and quoting : ‚ÄúFor I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord, plans for your welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.‚Äù In Dublin attendees also left with a verse from the Bible to reflect upon, and in Chicago they were given hot chocolate. An organizer in Britain describes Nightfever as \\"a door opener. For those who once had faith in God we hope they will be renewed through their experience at St Patrick's. For those who have never met Christ we hope this becomes a moment of fruitful encounter.\\" Events often see hundreds and even thousands of people attend.

The construction of it was completed in 1858 at Turku Old Shipyard, Finland. From 1860 to 1865, the corvette served in the Pacific Fleet of Russia. At the time, Finland was an autonomous grand duchy (1809-1917) within the Russian Empire.  Construction and launching of Kalevala  The corvette was designed by the ship designer J√∂rgensen, under the auspices of the Finnish Vice Admiral Johan Eberhard von Schantz (1802-1880), who was promoted to admiral in 1866. The construction of the vessel was funded by the Senate of Finland. The total cost of the ship's construction was 342'804 Russian silver rubles (the Finnish Markka became the currency of Finland from 1860 onward).

The displacement of the vessel was 1500 tons. The ship was set afloat on July 2, 1858. In December, 1858, the Military Commissary of Finland hired machinists and boiler-men to work on the ship. In March, 1859, offers of food supplies for the crew were solicited. Huuto-kauppoja, Suomen Julkisia Sanomia (\\"Public News of Finland\\"), No. 10. March 3, 1859, page 4. In the early summer of 1859, the steam engines of the vessel were tested at the Baltic Sea waters near Kronstadt. From the start, Finnish Baron Otto Carpelan operated as the captain of the ship. Finnish Paul Karl Toppelius (later promoted to rear admiral) became the head of the officers serving on the ship. Still during the springtime of 1860, machinists were hired for the ship's sailing season of 1860.  Kalevala in the Pacific Fleet of Russia  = Kalevala in the Russian Far East = With the 1858 Peace Treaty of Aigun and the 1860 Peace Treaty of Peking, Russia extended its territories in the Far East. Unexpectedly, in 1860 Kalevala was pointed in the service of the Pacific Fleet of Russia, with new home port in Nikolayevsk-on-Amur in the Russian Far East. Baron Otto Carpelan remained the captain of Kalevala on the sail of the vessel from Kronstadt at the Baltic Sea to the vessel's new home port on the Russian coast of the Pacific Ocean.

The voyage was headed by Rear Admiral Andrei Alexandrovit≈° Popov. According to at least one Russian source, Otto Carpelan continued as the captain of Kalevala beyond this voyage, in the duties assigned for the vessel in the service of the Russian Pacific Fleet.–≠–∫—Å–ø–µ–¥–∏—Ü–∏—è —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ñ–ª–æ—Ç–∞ –∫ –±–µ—Ä–µ–≥–∞–º –°–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–π –ê–º–µ—Ä–∏–∫–∏ (18 –∏—é–ª—è 1863‚Äì20 –∏—é–ª—è 1864) According to another source, also Vladimir Davydov skippered Kalevala, and from 1863 also Fedor ≈Ωeltuhin (–§–µ–¥–æ—Ä –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–µ–≤–∏—á –ñ–µ–ª—Ç—É—Ö–∏–Ω).–ñ–ï–õ–¢–£–•–ò–ù –§–µ–¥–æ—Ä –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–µ–≤–∏—á (1826-1898).

(in Russian). = Finnish seamen and vessels in Russian America = Russian America was the name of Russian colonial possessions in North America from 1733 to 1867, that today is the U.S. State of Alaska and settlements in California (1) and Hawaii (3 - starting in 1817) (distant from the North American landmass in the Pacific Ocean and therefore more commonly associated with the other territories of Oceania). Formal incorporation of the possessions by Russia did not take place until the establishment of the Russian-American Company (RAC) in 1799. Finnish Chief Managers (\\"governors\\") of Russian America included Arvid Adolf Ethol√©n (a.k.a. Etolin) in 1840-1845 and Johan Hampus Furuhjelm in 1859-1864.Ethol√©n, Arvid Adolf (1798 - 1876) Chief Manager of Russian America in 1840-1845, rear admiral, explorer (in Finnish).Johan Hampus Furuhjelm Chief Manager of Russian America in 1859-1864, admiral, explorer (in Finnish). A third Finn, Johan Joachim von Bartram, declined the offer for the five-year term between 1850 and 1855. All three were high ranking Imperial naval officers. Researcher Maria J. Enckell states the following about the Finns in the Russian-American Company: :\\"Russia relied heavily on Finnish seamen. These seamen manned Russian naval ships as well as its deep-sea-going vessels. Company records show that in the early 1800s these ships were crewed predominantly by merchant seamen from Finland. From 1840 onward the Company‚Äôs around-the-world ships were manned entirely by Finnish merchant skippers and crews. Most Company ships stationed in Sitka and the Northern Pacific were likewise manned by Finnish skippers and Finnish crews.\\"Scandinavian Immigration to Russian Alaska, 1800-1867. Author: Maria Jarlsdotter Enckell. Page 108. :\\"Significant too is that from the early 1800s the Finnish seamen sailing these ships had journeyed up and down the North and South American coasts. Salt, used by the Company in preserving pelts, was obtained on islands in Baja California. Fort Ross in Bodega Bay, just north of San Francisco, was a stop on that route until 1841 when the fort was sold to the ‚Äúswindler‚Äù Johann Sutter, on whose land the first California Gold was found. Thus, all Finnish seamen plying these waters knew every nook and cranny on these shores. Similarly they knew equally well the coast on the Asiatic side. Returning to Finland on their mandatory around-the-world journeys, they spread the news of the riches they had seen.\\" :\\"San Francisco‚Äôs harbor records and the Russian Consular records display the names of many Finnish and Baltic Russian Alaska skippers busily plying the waters between San Francisco, Petropavlovsk, Nikolajefsk and Vladivostok.\\" ... \\"Long before the turn of the century 11% of San Francisco‚Äôs seaman community were Finns. The commercial activities of these former Finnish Russian-American Company skippers and their men were impressive. At least two are known to have become multimillionaires: Gustaf Nybom (later Niebaum), the founder of Inglenook wineries, and Otto Wilhelm Lindholm of Vladivostok. Their business ventures had interests spread across the Northern Pacific. This activity continued until 1922 and the Soviet terror, when Vladivostok's numerous Finns and Manchurians were rounded up, marched to the central square and shot.\\"\\"Long before the turn of the century 11% of San Francisco‚Äôs seaman community were Finns.\\" Scandinavian Immigration to Russian Alaska, 1800-1867.

In 1817-1818, Arvid Adolf Ethol√©n skippered the Russian frigate Kamchatka from Kronstadt to the Alaskan port of Sitka, the capital of Russian America, known as Novoarkhangelsk (\\"New Archangel\\") under Russian rule. As a captain of several ships, Ethol√©n then sailed from Sitka to California, Sandwich Islands and other areas, and in 1821-1823 he explored and mapped the utmost northwestern edges of the Pacific Rim of North America, between Alaska and the Bering Strait. In 1824, Ethol√©n skippered the Finnish- builtThe brig ‚ÄùBaikal‚Äù was built in Helsinki (1847) and the corvette ‚ÄùVarjag‚Äù in Oulu.

On the same day with Nikolai I, also the Russian ship Konstantin arrived in Sitka, under the command of Finnish Johan Joachim von Bartram (who later declined the opportunity to govern the Russian America from 1850 to 1855). In 1839, Sitka Lutheran Church, the first Protestant congregation on the west coast of the Americas and the first Lutheran congregation on the entire Pacific Rim was founded in Sitka, Alaska by Finns, and other Lutherans who worked for Russian-American Company. From the start, in 1840-1865, three consecutive Finnish pastors served this pastorate: Uno Cygnaeus (1840-1845), Gabriel Plath√°n (1845-1852) and Georg Gustaf Winter (1852-1865). The Finns Aaron Sj√∂strom and Otto Reinhold Rehn served as the parish organists/sextons during the same period.Scandinavian Immigration to Russian Alaska, 1800-1867. Author: Maria Jarlsdotter Enckell. In 1841, under the governorship of Russian America by Finnish Arvid Adolf Ethol√©n (1840-1845) (promoted to rear admiral in 1847), the Russian-American area of Fort Ross in Bodega Bay, California, was sold to Johann Sutter. On January 24, 1848, the first California gold was discovered on Sutter's land in Coloma, California, leading to the California Gold Rush, after news of this were spread abroad, mainly by the seamen serving for the Russian-American Company. In 1850 and 1852, Johan Hampus Furuhjelm sailed to the U.S. West Coast. After he became the Chief Manager of Russian America (1858-1864), he put an end to the hostilities with the natives in Alaska. He also succeeded in abolishing the Alaskan Ice Treaty with San Francisco. According to a contract which had been signed, Russian America had to deliver a certain amount of ice to San Francisco at a fixed price. A problem was caused by the product melting down on the way to the warmer climates. The ice contract became a very awkward deal for the Finnish-Russian colony. Furuhjelm arranged for a new contract to sell ice to San Francisco: 3'000 tons at $25.00 a ton. The Finnish Chief Managers of Russian America Ethol√©n and Furuhjelm helped pave way for the American Alaska purchase, and the Finnish Sea Captain Gustave Niebaum as the Consul of Russia in San Francisco played a critical role in the final striking of the deal that made Alaska a part of the United States of America in 1867. As a legacy of their accomplishment, their names can still today be found on the map in several places on the U.S. West Coast. Etolin Island was named after Ethol√©n (a.k.a. Etolin) by the United States in the wake of the Alaska Purchase of 1867. There is also Etolin Strait, as well as a cape, a point and a mountain named after Ethol√©n.The Finns in America, Taru Spiegel, Reference Librarian. The Library of Congress. = Kalevala in San Francisco in 1861 - during the U.S. Civil War = During the California Gold Rush and in its aftermath, a substantial Finnish population had settled in San Francisco. In addition to Ethol√©n, Furuhjelm and Niebaum, a number of Finns had become household names in the social circles of San Francisco by the time when the Finnish corvette Kalevala anchored in San Francisco on November 14, 1861.The Finnish migration to and from Russian Alaska and the Pacific Siberian Rim 1800‚Äì1900 M.

Kalevala stayed in San Francisco over the Christmas holidays. On Christmas Day, the City of San Francisco presented the officers of Kalevala a Flag of the United States of America as a present.San Francisco History ‚Äì Events of 1861. The day after Boxing Day, a festive dinner party was arranged in honor of the officers of Kalevala at the concert hall of the newly opened Platt's Hall, located at the northeastern corner of Bush and Montgomery Streets.Platt's Hall at the northeastern corner of Bush and Montgomery Streets The Bancroft Library. University of California, Berkeley.City Guard (San Francisco) ‚Äì California Militia and National Guard Unit Histories. The website of the California State Military Museum provides the following quote, which describes the event: :\\"A military and civic subscription ball was given at Platt's Hall, on the evening of Friday, December 27, 1861, complimentary to the officers of the Russian steam corvette Calevala, by the citizens of San Francisco, as a token of the public appreciation of the friendly spirit manifested by the Emperor of all the Russia toward our federal government. All arrangements for this ball were confided to the members of the \\"City Guard\\" by a committee of the most prominent people. Lieutenant Wm. C. Little was the floor manager, assisted by four non-commissioned officers of the company. Captain Clark, chairman of the reception committee, was assisted by all the other members of the company, every one being in the full fancy uniform of the corps. The \\"press\\", in describing the affair, spoke thus of the \\"City Guard\\": \\"One of the most spirited and efficient of our local uniform militia companies, whose proverbial good taste was fully sustained in the admirable manner in which the ball was conducted.\\" = Kalevala in San Francisco in 1863-1864 - during the U.S. Civil War = A festive dinner party arranged in honor of Admiral Popoff and the naval officers of the Russian Pacific Fleet visiting San Francisco in 1863. In 1863, a six-vessel Russian Imperial Navy squadron, a part of the Russian Pacific Fleet, sailed via Vladivostok to the West Coast of the United States, to help defend the waters there against a possible attack by the United Kingdom or France, during the American Civil War (April 12, 1861 ‚Äì May 10, 1865).1863-1864 Russian Fleet Expedition to North America From the History of Russia's Pacific Fleet ‚Äì Founding of VladivostokLatter Half of the 19th Century ‚Äì The Ironclads ‚Äì rusnavy.com In addition to the Finnish-built corvette Kalevala now returning to the U.S. West Coast, this squadron included three other corvettes, Bogatyr, Rynda and Novik (Russian: \\"–ù–æ–≤–∏–∫\\"), and two Finnish-built clippers, the sister-ships Abrek (Russian: \\"–ê–±—Ä–µ–∫\\") and Vsadnik (Russian: \\"–í—Å–∞–¥–Ω–∏–∫\\"), both built in the southwestern Finnish town of Pori and launched in 1860.

The residents of San Francisco decorated with gold medals the sailors who had been wounded. Special thanks was given e.g. to Lieutenant Ethol√©n (not same as Governor Ethol√©n). On October 17, 1863, a dinner reception was organized in honor of the 35 officers of the Russian fleet. The San Francisco residents willing to attend the event were charged a $100 attendance fee, which at the time was considered highly expensive. Still 50 years after the event, the local San Francisco newspaper The San Francisco Chronicle marveled the fabulous service of the reception.When San Franciscans Paid $100 Each For Ball Tickets, San Francisco Chronicle.

Russian Baltic Fleet in the U.S. East Coast in 1863-1864 - during the U.S. Civil War  Another Russian six-vessel squadron, a part of the Russian Baltic Fleet, arrived in the U.S. East Coast only days before the Pacific Fleet anchored at the U.S. West Coast. The Baltic Fleet arrived in New York City starting on September 24, 1863. The squadron was commanded by Rear Admiral Stepan Lesovski. The occasion gave the Union Army a much needed lift from the very somber mood caused by the Union Army defeat in the great Battle of Chickamauga, fought in September 19‚Äì20, 1863, only four days before the arrival of the Russian fleet. The Russian Baltic Fleet stayed in the American waters for seven months, paying side visits to Boston, Minneapolis and Washington D.C. The two Russian navy expeditions to North America during the U.S. Civil War, one to the West Coast and another to the East Coast, and the Kalevala expedition in 1861-1862 were the only concrete foreign military support received by President Abraham Lincoln and the Union Army during the course of the entire war, fought in 1861-1865. As the navy of the Union was a one ocean navy, concentrated in the Atlantic waters, the help of the Russian Imperial Navy was of critical importance to the Union forces, which had no war ships to defend the U.S. West Coast during the time when there was a great fear of the Confederate naval vessels attacking San Francisco.

It is also known as the 10th Ward of New Orleans,10th Ward of New Orleans and it is one of the city's 17 wards. Faubourg Lafayette was founded with small settlements around steamboat landings in New Orleans. John Poultney acquired the property from Madame Rousseau on May 2, 1818 (with M. de Armas, Notary, officiating). This was a plantation measuring about ten acres (ten arpents), near the Mississippi River waterfront. The property was bounded by the lower line of the property that was owned by Jacques Fran√ßois Enoul de Livaudais. This property ran through the squares between Soraparu and First streets at Tchoupitoulas Street. St. Andrew Street is the street that bounds the property below. John Poultney caused a plan to be made by Joseph Pilie on March 2, 1824, by which he subdivided his plantation into lots and squares. The subdivision was named Faubourg Lafayette, in honor of the Marquis de Lafayette, who visited New Orleans for four days in April 1825 during his triumphal tour of the United States, the country whose independence he had helped to win in his youth.http://www.knowla.org/entry/725/ Marquis de Lafayette's 1824-25 visit to the U.S. The faubourg became the City of Lafayette, then part of Jefferson Parish and its first parish seat. Lafayette was a separate municipality until it was incorporated into New Orleans, Orleans Parish, in 1852. The present boundaries include St. Charles Avenue, Jackson Avenue, the Pontchartrain Expressway, and Simon Bolivar Avenue. Jackson Avenue was once the heart of the city of Lafayette, along the old New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad line. Closer to the river, the 10th Ward includes part of the lower Garden District. It is also the location of America's first experiment with public housing, which started in 1937 when the country was full of optimism with the start of the New Deal. President Roosevelt signed the loan for the construction to commence, of the Magnolia Housing Projects, the first authorized spending under the Housing Act of 1937, also known as the Wagner-Steagall Act.http://www.jerichohousing.org Faubourg Lafayette is a neighborhood that is partly residential and partly commercial, with businesses such as Brown's Velvet Dairy. The main street is Oretha Castle Haley Boulevard, which is where most of the neighborhood's businesses are located.  Geography  The Faubourg Lafayette location area coordinates are 29¬∞56‚Äô30.053‚Äù North 90¬∞04‚Äô 41.109‚Äù West. The Elevation in the neighborhood ranged from 0 ‚Äì 4 Feet. The area is approximately 0.264 square miles (0.684 square kilometers) and contains 61 city blocks. Faubourg Lafayette is located in the Central City district. = Boundaries = Faubourg is a French word that stands for suburb, which is a smaller area outside of a larger city.1.http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/faubourg Due to the fact that Faubourg Lafayette is not officially recognized by the state of Louisiana, the boundaries of the area are very roughly defined. The City of New Orleans website contains no information about the neighborhood but does have a tab ready for information to be input.http://www.nola.gov/neighborhood- engagement/neighborhood-organizations/faubourg-lafayette-neighborhood/ According to the official historic neighborhood association website for Faubourg Lafayette, ‚ÄúNo one has drawn the neighborhood map yet.‚Äùhttp://www.neighborhoodlink.com/Historic_Faubourg_Lafayette/map However, the website does provide a map for the general area. Although many of the Louisiana and New Orleans websites do not have any information on the boundaries of Faubourg Lafayette, Google.com/Maps does. It recognizes the borders as Simon Bolivar Avenue to Jackson Avenue and St. Charles Avenue to Calliope Street.https://www.google.com/maps?t=m‚â™=29.9396326,-90.0800157&z;=16&q;=Faubourg+Lafayette&output;=classic&dg;=ntvo The land for the neighborhood was first acquired on May 2, 1818. It bordered the Mississippi River at Tchoupitoulas Street and ran north between 1st Street and Soraparu Street. This area is located to the southwest of the current faubourg and is located in a neighborhood called the Irish Channel.http://nutrias.org/links/nolinks/faubourgs.pdf = Adjacent neighborhoods = *Broadmoor, New Orleans (northwest) *Milan, New Orleans (west) *Garden District, New Orleans (southwest) *Lower Garden District (south) *Central Business District, New Orleans (east) *Gert Town, New Orleans (north)  Demographics  The census tract border 134 for the American community Survey 2012 has slightly larger borders however it is generally the same area. The borders are from Felicity Street to Prytania Street, Thalia Street to magazine Street, Calliope Street to south Rampart Street, and Thalia Street to Oretha Haley Boulevard. Also, the census for 1990 and 2000 have the same borders but have been split down the middle at Thalia Street. The two sections are defined as census tract 67 and 79. When looking at the data for those time periods we simply added the data for the two tracts together so they could be comparable to the 2012 data. The census of 2012 average median household income was 29,229. The total population was approximately 1,352 and the percent of the population 65 and older was 11.4%. The percent of the population in the labor force was 76.3%.https://www.census.gov/censusexplorer/censusexplorer.html The census of 2000 average median household income was 28,551(price in 2012 dollar appreciation). The total population was approximately 1,490 and the percent of the population 65 and older was 22.35%.

The percent of the population in the labor force was 39.35%.https://www.census.gov/censusexplorer/censusexplorer.html History In 1718, the city of New Orleans, Louisiana (New France), was established.http://nutrias.org/links/nolinks/faubourgs.pdf The original town was what is now called the French Quarter. New Orleans later expanded into additional neighborhoods, planning new streets and squares. Faubourg Lafayette was united by an act of legislation, prior to being classified as an official neighborhood. However, Faubourg Lafayette once belonged to another parish of Louisiana before it was annexed by New Orleans. This area was a municipality called Lafayette, the seat of Jefferson Parish from 1825 to 1852. Other neighborhoods such as Faubourg Nuns and Faubourg Delaissize were part of Lafayette for a time. In 1818, Faubourg Lafayette was bought as a neighborhood and became a subdivision in 1824. In its newborn years as a city, it was cut into blocks and squares by John Poultney. Poultney acquired this neighborhood from Madame Rousseau, who like Samuel Herman bought his neighborhood from the heirs of Valery Delaissize. Both of these neighborhoods started as plantations, but the new owners decided to subdivide them in order to make more living space available for the growing population. In 1796, Bertrand Gravier helped enlarge the Faubourg by including Phillipa St., which is now referred to as Poydras Street. Years later, Gravier died and Jean Gravier, his brother, was appointed to be the new owner of this estate. He continued in his brother's footsteps by further extending the Faubourg to Circus Street, which is currently known as Rampart Street. As Jean Gravier continued to expand the Faubourg, he allotted land near Poydras Street, approximately 40 feet in width, for a canal. This canal linked with an agency in Bayou St. John and flowed into an area called Hagan Avenue. The region which was the canal is now Jefferson Davis Parkway. In addition, Gravier designated a tract for a turning basin which linked to Canal Street. At that time the basin was an uninhabited district of land which was allocated for the community. Unsurprisingly, he later called the basin ‚ÄúPlace Gravier.‚Äùhttp://nutrias.org/links/nolinks/faubourgs.pdf Jean Gravier didn't realize that the canal and ‚ÄúPlace Gravier‚Äù would become the basis of dissension between the city of New Orleans and the New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad. At this time, the railroad company possessed the Canal, the Basin, and asserted ownership of segments of ‚ÄúPlace Gravier.‚Äù The dispute between New Orleans and the railroad concluded when the Supreme Court of the Territory of Orleans announced a judgment in support of Jean Gravier, on May 23, 1805.http://nutrias.org/links/nolinks/faubourgs.pdf In 1841, the Supreme Court of Louisiana pronounced that the Canal and Basin were property of the railroad company. However years later, in 1876, the Supreme Court altered their judgment and decided that the ‚ÄúPlace Gravier‚Äù would be owned by New Orleans and as a location for the general public. This explains why in 1897, the city of New Orleans took legal action against Philip Werlein for possession of this basin. The location was declared to be public property as had been stated in the judgment of 1841. New Orleans won the lawsuit against Werlein and the Supreme Court of Louisiana. When the displeased Werlein decided that this verdict wasn't fair, he appealed the finding to the Supreme Court of the United States and they rendered a judgment in support of him. The U.S. Supreme Court reasoned that New Orleans had lost ownership of ‚ÄúPlace Gravier.‚Äù So Philip Werlein was able to obtain possession of the disputed property, and this site is now occupied by the infamous Hotel de Soto.http://nutrias.org/links/nolinks/faubourgs.pdf Faubourg Lafayette is distinctive in its perimeters because of its unique history. Faubourg Lafayette lies in the upper section of New Orleans. The perimeters of Faubourg Lafayette are St. Charles Avenue, Calliope Street, Jackson Avenue, and Simon Bolivar Avenue. Today this area is known for its diverse mixture of businesses, homes, schools, and visitor attractions. Landmarks There are many special landmarks in this neighborhood. This neighborhood is situated close to The Garden District, New Orleans, where there are many celebrity residences. Oretha Castle Haley is the main street that runs through the neighborhood of Faubourg Lafayette and holds many of the neighborhood's attractions. There are many more buildings with significant purposes and historical background. A Catholic church sits on Oretha Castle Haley Blvd; this church is St. John the Baptist Catholic Church. There is also a community center situated on Clio St., which is very close to the church. This community center is used as an after school care for many young children and as a recreational center that stimulates children and young adults so that they do not get into any trouble in the neighborhood. Also, inside this community center is a head start program for small children while their parents are at work, or on tour in the city. In addition, Brown's Velvet Dairy which is where the dairy is made for much of the city. Brown's Dairy is a very big tourist attraction for the city because this is the dairy factory for the city. Many tourists are astounded by the fact that the dairy products for the New Orleans area comes locally. Also in this area is a cultural arts center known as the Ashe' Cultural Arts Center. In this center, many plays and cultural events happen in this center. In this cultural center, there are ways that the facilities may be rented by outside proprietors, such as schools, churches, and other community centers. The calendar of the events for this community center is posted on the website for the cultural arts center. There is also a summer program at the Ashe‚Äô Cultural Arts Center in Faubourg Lafayette for children ages 6‚Äì16. The program's mission is to promote the cultural arts through teaching the children yoga, visual arts, dance, martial arts, stepping, and voice. They also provide the children with breakfast, lunch, and a snack daily. The prices for this tuition are posted on the cultural center website. Other landmarks in the area are various cafes and restaurants. One specific caf√© in the area is Cafe Reconcile. This nonprofit caf√© provides training and lifelong skills to youth that are ‚Äúat-risk.‚Äù They have set up a program for these youth and since the time that they opened; more than 1,000 youth have successfully completed the program. Many could argue that this is a culinary school for these at risk youth because many of the youth that have completed this course and went into the culinary business in New Orleans. It is located in Oretha Castle Haley Blvd. There is also a homeless shelter located in the neighborhood. It is called The New Orleans Mission Homeless Shelter, located on Baronne St. It is dedicated to serve the homeless people of the Tenth Ward area so that they may have a dry place to stay on any given night and a hot meal on any given day.http://neworleansmission.org/ The shelter also holds many different fundraising opportunities for the shelter and hosts many social events. Oretha Castle Haley Blvd. also houses the New Orleans Jazz Market. This is a place a place that jazz bands have been able to perform. Other landmarks that have taken form recently in Faubourg Lafayette are the Southern Food and Beverage Museum, also known as SoFAB. These museums are taking up shop on O.C. Haley Blvd. The Southern Food and Beverage Museum will now be moved to the building that was formally the Dryades Market. Many more landmarks are in this general area in the New Orleans area.  Schools/education  This neighborhood of Faubourg Lafayette is also known for its vast assortment of educational advancements in their district. The New Orleans Cooking Experience is located on 1519 Carondelet Street. This institution specializes in culinary training and has excellent reviews despite the complaints about expensive tuition. The Myrtle Rosebella Banks School is located 1307 Oretha Castle Haley Blvd. near Martin Luther King Blvd. This is a public school that is a part of Orleans Parish. Myrtle Rosebella Banks School educates youth beginning at Pre-Kindergarten all the way to sixth grade.http://louisiana.schooltree.org/public/Myrtle-Rosebella- Banks-036501.html Another public school in this area is James M. Singleton Charter School.http://dryadesymca.com/?page_id=21 This school is small in size, but its academic statics are notable. The International High School of New Orleans is located 1400 Camp St., in New Orleans, LA. This institution is highly recognized and acknowledged in the neighborhood Faubourg Lafayette and the state of Louisiana. The International High School of New Orleans is also a Charter School, and has open enrollment for all Louisiana residents entering grades nine through twelfth grade. Due to such outstanding academic statics, this schools general admission is based on a ‚Äúfirst-come, first-served basis to students‚Äù.http://www.ihsnola.org/admissions/ Located on 1522 Chippewa St. in New Orleans is the St. Michael Special School. This institution is small in capacity, but takes on a task that oversees most larger educational institutions do not. This school ‚Äúis designed to help students with major learning difficulties that hinder their ability to achieve success in a regular class setting‚Äù. This school does this by acknowledging students Catholic beliefs in their curriculum. While implementing vocational and physical training, the educators patiently motivate and push their students academically and socially. Unlike most public institutions, this school has a very wide age range of students ranging from 6-15 for the Elementary Department, 16-21 for the Vocational Training Department, and the Joy Center accepts adults 22 and older to participate in this learning facility. Not too far from the St. Michael Special School is the Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine. This college offers several academic programs that ‚Äúprovide a comprehensive, practice-based, global health-focused education at both the undergraduate and graduate level‚Äù. In addition, this institution offers degrees in six academic departments and is ‚Äúaccredited by the Council on Education for Public Health‚Äù. The post-graduate employment rate at the Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine is 90% or better. This indicates how successful this school is in preparing their students for life after college.http://tulane.edu/publichealth/about/index.cfm  Recent developments  The most significant development in recent years to the Faubourg Lafayette is the demolition of the St. Thomas Development. This was very important to the city because there were many citizens that lived in this housing development and when it was torn down, after Hurricane Katrina, many residents lost their homes and had to turn to the New Orleans Mission Homeless Shelter. This development housed only white residents until the 1960s due to segregation laws, and after the desegregation of the housing project, it became one of the country's most dangerous housing projects.St. Thomas Development St. Thomas Projects had become predominately African American by the end of the 1980s and remained that way until it had been torn down. The City of New Orleans was given a grant to demolish the site and rebuild, along with this grant was funding to help over 3,000 families to relocate to different areas during this time period. The idea of this was to create a mixed income neighborhood so the crime rate would decrease. As time progressed, there was rental property built on the property. Other notable and recent developments include the New Orleans Jazz Museum taking residence on Oretha Castle Haley Blvd, the neighborhood's most notable and main strip. The New Orleans Jazz Market, which is the home of the new Jazz Orchestra, will be moved to the vacant Gator's Department Store spot. This new and improved space will include jazz archives and a ‚Äúwalk of fame.‚Äù Also, due to recent updates on the neighborhood website, the citizens are attempting to beautify the area. There is a blight and beautification committee dedicated to doing just that.‚ÄúFaubourg Lafayette Neighborhood Association Website‚Äù The blight and beautification volunteers are in charge of making sure that there are no poisonous weeds or other plant life to the neighborhood. In addition, they are in charge of beautifying a specific part of the neighborhood, whether that means to plant trees or pick up garbage off the streets. There is also a publication of a monthly newsletter telling of the upcoming events for any specific month. This is especially helpful for freshman seminar classes that are looking for a community service project or a community service project in general. Developments along O.C. Haley include the new arrival of the SoFAB Museum, also known as the Southern Food and Beverage Museum. The museum will be settled in the building that used to be the Dryades Market. This museum will include culinary culture and history. Also, in this museum, there will be The Museum of the American Cocktail detailing the history of certain cocktails throughout American history. In addition, there will be a Gallery of the States. The Gallery of States would include an exhibit outlining cuisine from the other Southern states and The District of Columbia. There will be an adjacent building to the museum holding many galleries, offices, a rooftop garden, and a children's gallery. More information about the building and planning of the Southern Food and Beverage Museum will be published on Facebook and Twitter. These recent developments have really altered the way the neighborhood is perceived because the public perception of the Tenth Ward had long been a bad one, and now, citizens are willing to visit the neighborhood and participate in the many activities that are held there. The St. Thomas Development is no longer in the Faubourg Lafayette neighborhood, but there is rental property set in this area.  Politics  The city of New Orleans and the parish of Orleans operate as a merged city-parish government. Before the city of New Orleans became co-extensive with Orleans Parish (or before it annexed towns from what used to be Jefferson Parish), the area was home to numerous smaller communities. The original city of New Orleans was composed of what are now the 1st through 9th wards. The city of Lafayette (including the Garden District) was added in 1852 as the 10th and 11th wards. Because the neighborhood of New Orleans is located within the city of New Orleans, it has a mayor-council government. This means that there is a city council consisting of seven council members, elected by the district and two at-large council members. Currently the mayor of New Orleans is Mayor Mitchell J. Landrieu who was elected February 6, 2010. Mary Landrieu is a United States Senator. She was elected to the House of Representatives in 1979. She served from 1980 to 1988 and represented a New Orleans district. Landrieu was re- elected to the 90th district in October 1983 with a 78% vote. Landrieu was elected in 1996 to the United States Senate seat after defeating Louisiana State Representative Woody Jenkins of Baton Rouge in the general election. New Orleans and Faubourg Lafayette fall under the 2nd congressional district; therefore Cedric Richmond represents it. He is a member of the Democratic Party and has been a U.S. Representative for Louisiana's 2nd congressional district since 2011. Karen Carter Peterson is the present State Senator for Louisiana. She has been a democratic member of the Louisiana State Senate, and has represented Louisiana since 2010. Currently she is Chairperson of the Louisiana Democratic Party. She is also the first female to serves as chair of Louisiana's Democratic Party, and since 2008 she has served as Democratic National Committeewomen of Louisiana. Prior to serving as the State Senator, she served in the Louisiana House of Representatives. State Representatives Walt Leger, Neil Abramson, and Helena Moreno serve as the State Representatives who represent districts 91, 98, and 93. LaToya Cantrell serves on district B city council, whereas, Jacquelyn Brechtel Clarkson and Stacy Head serves as the council members at large. Faubourg Lafayette is located in Orleans Parish; therefore the Orleans Parish Jail is used where inmates are housed. The jail is located at 531 South Broad Street; it is operated by the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office. The City of New Orleans pays the Orleans Parish Sheriff per-prisoner and per-day to house inmates. As of May 2013, Orleans Parish Prison was ranked as one of the worst prisons in the country according to Mother Jones magazine. The Sheriff for the Parish of Orleans is Sheriff Marlin Gusman, who has been twice elected. He is responsible for the care, custody and control of inmates at this particular correctional facility in the United States. He is also the Executive Officer for the Criminal and Civil Courts in New Orleans, where is responsible for the service of subpoenas, courtroom security, and the executor process. He also provides security for the Criminal District Court, and provides backup for the New Orleans Police Department on an as-needed basis. The Orleans Parish Civil Sheriff's Office serves papers involving lawsuits and provides security for the Civil District Court and Juvenile Courts.

A young woman promises to be faithful to her lover when he goes off to fight in the Second World War. However, in his absence she becomes a prostitute and takes up with a notorious criminal. When her real love returns he kills her new boyfriend. Deeply ashamed of her conduct, she becomes a nun.

Gerard, aged twenty-eight, was a mechanic; Catherine, was twenty- seven. They were killed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) on 8 September 1985, the IRA alleging they were informers. However at least two of those responsible for their deaths were later uncovered as British agents within the IRA's Internal Security Unit, leaving the actual status of the Mahons as informers open to doubt. Background The Mahons were neighbours of estate agent Joseph Fenton, a supplier of 'safe houses' for the IRA, but also a British agent. When a number of IRA missions were compromised, Fenton is believed to have directed a member of the Internal Security Unit, Freddie Scappaticci, and three other men, to the Mahons. Abducted in August, interrogated and beaten for prolonged periods, the Mahons eventually confessed that their flat was bugged by the Royal Ulster Constabulary, who are alleged to have paid the couple for information, weapons finds, or arrests. The IRA took the couple to Norglen Crescent in Turf Lodge and shot them. It is thought Catherine Mahon was shot in the back while trying to escape. Deaths Those who found their bodies said at the time: > We heard two bursts of gunfire and then a car was driven away at high speed. > We went out and discovered the girl. We thought she was dead. We tried first > aid but the side of her head was blown away. A young lad came up to us > saying there was a man lying in the entry a bit further up and still alive. > We got to him and he was badly wounded. He was struggling to breath and > choking on his own blood. He had been hit in the side of the head and the > face. Whatever is behind it all, it's ridiculous. Those responsible are > animals. Nothing justifies murder. They had both been tied by their wrists ‚Äì > but they must have broken free by struggling when they realised what was > going to happen.

A spin-off of Rio de Janeiro's Rock in Rio festival, it was held on two consecutive weekends in May 2015 at the Las Vegas Festival Grounds on the Las Vegas Strip. It shared a similar structure and format to its Brazilian counterpart, hosting at least 120 acts for its first and only edition, while its site was developed in cooperation with organizers. The event was a partnership with SFX Entertainment (which had acquired an operating stake in the Rock in Rio festival), the festival's Brazilian stakeholder IMX, MGM Resorts International, Yucaipa Companies, and Cirque du Soleil Entertainment Group. Per the terms of the organizers' contract with the venue, the festival was to be held biennially from 2015 through at least 2019. The first edition was held across two weekends of two days each, and was to expand into a three- day, two-weekend format during the subsequent editions. However, after attendance and revenue from the 2015 edition were below expectations, plans for future editions of the event were quietly shelved.  Development  In November 2013, SFX Entertainment, an electronic dance music events company founded by Robert F.X. Sillerman, reached a deal with Roberto Medina, organizer of the Rock in Rio festival series, to acquire a 50% stake in a new entity that would own the rock music festival alongside Eike Batista's IMX, with SFX replacing IMX as the managing partner of the festival. Sillerman also disclosed that plans were being made to bring the festival to the United States for the first time ever. Medina revealed further information about these plans in an interview with Billboard shortly after the deal was reached. He stated that the inaugural festival was to be held in Las Vegas in May 2015, at a site in proximity to the Las Vegas Strip. Medina touted that in comparison to other, U.S.-based festivals, Rock in Rio USA was going to be \\"bigger in terms of public, in terms of sponsorship, in terms of social media. Not a little bit bigger, a lot bigger.\\" On March 20, 2014, Rock in Rio USA was officially announced, to be held in May 2015. For its inaugural year, it would consist of four days of performances held across two weekends, with plans to expand to six days on subsequent editions. In April 2014, further details were announced; on April 22, 2014, it was announced that Rock in Rio would partner with MGM Resorts International, Cirque du Soleil, and Ron Burkle's Yucaipa Companies to construct a 33-acre open-air multi-purpose venue on the Strip near Circus Circus as its site. While the festival itself would not have any direct ownership stake in the venue, it contributed resources to its development, and secured a long-term deal to hold Rock in Rio USA at the venue biennially from 2015 to 2019. Additionally, Yucaipa Companies and Cirque each acquired a 20% equity stake in a subsidiary that would own Rock in Rio USA; Rock in Rio CEO Louis Justo explained that the involvement of Cirque du Soleil was oriented more towards their knowledge of the Las Vegas market and its consumers, rather than their creative works. At least $30 million was spent on promoting the festival's inaugural edition across multiple platforms, including marketing partnerships with Clear Channel Communications and National CineMedia.  Venue  Circus Circus Las Vegas, a casino near the site of the Las Vegas Festival Grounds Rock in Rio USA was held at the Las Vegas Festival Grounds, a , open-air venue with a capacity of 80,000, located on Sahara Avenue near the MGM-owned Circus Circus Las Vegas hotel and casino. It is owned by the MGM/Yucaipa/Cirque consortium, who collectively spent $20 million on its development. Rock in Rio organizers collaborated with MGM and Yucaipa on the design of the venue to ensure a \\"very premium festival experience\\", stating that it would have an amusement park-inspired layout with five stages (including dedicated stages for indie and electronic music acts), rides (such as a roulette-themed ferris wheel and a zipline), shopping, and themed food courts.  Lineup  = 2015= For its inaugural edition, the festival featured a lineup of at least 120 acts. The two weekends of the festival were oriented towards different genres. The first weekend's lineup was rock-oriented, with the second being pop-oriented. Owing to its increasing prominence in the festival (especially under SFX ownership), electronic music acts were featured on a dedicated stage; additionally, plans were disclosed for a nightly feature where an EDM act would \\"fly\\" from the main stage to the EDM stage, and transform the venue into a \\"360-degree nightclub\\" to close each night. The first artists for the 2015 lineup were revealed on September 26, 2014, at an event in New York City, including the Deftones, Jessie J, John Legend, Linkin Park, No Doubt, Metallica, and Taylor Swift. *Friday, May 8 **Main Stage: No Doubt, Man√°, The Pretty Reckless, Smallpools, Cirque du Soleil **Mercedes-Benz Evolution Stage: Foster the People, Gary Clark Jr., Theophilus London, Saints of Valory **EDM Stage: AN21, Ftampa, Wax Motif, MVTH *Saturday, May 9 **Main Stage: Metallica, Linkin Park, Rise Against, Hollywood Undead **Mercedes-Benz Evolution Stage: Deftones, Sepultura featuring Steve Vai, Coheed & Cambria, Of Mice & Men **EDM Stage: Alok, Caked Up, The Gaslamp Killer, Felguk *Friday, May 15 **Main Stage: Taylor Swift (1989 World Tour), Ed Sheeran, Echosmith, Ivete Sangalo **Mercedes-Benz Evolution Stage: Jessie J, Charli XCX, Tove Lo, James Bay **EDM Stage: Heidi Lawden, Valida, Jeniluv, Whitney Fierce *Saturday, May 16 **Main Stage: Bruno Mars, John Legend, Empire of the Sun, Big Sean **Mercedes-Benz Evolution Stage: Joss Stone, Magic!, Mayer Hawthorne, Mikky Ekko **EDM Stage: DJ Vibe, Lovefingers, Renato Ratier, Behrouz  Aftermath  Rock in Rio's attendance was lower than expected; only 140,000 attended in total, less than the 328,000 estimated prior to the event. As such, stakeholders doubted that the festival would return for 2017. In February 2016, SFX Entertainment filed for bankruptcy, and was reorganized under new leadership as LiveStyle in December. In May 2018, Live Nation Entertainment acquired a majority stake in Rock in Rio, including from SFX's creditor committee.

The video game was developed and published by Sega for PlayStation 3 and was a launch title for PlayStation 4. Set in the chaotic Bakumatsu period between 1853 and 1867, Sakamoto Ry≈çma is distressed resulting from conflicting pressures and uncertainty about one's self and role in the society. Being embroiled in the middle of a Tosa coup d'√©tat and bent on finding the murderer who assassinated his mentor, Ryoma burrows himself with a hidden identity in the streets of Kyoto and joins the grim Shinsengumi. Despite being the second Ry≈´ ga Gotoku series spin-off set in the samurai era instead of modern-day Japan, this game is unrelated to Ry≈´ ga Gotoku Kenzan!, which was released in 2008 on the PlayStation 3. Kenzan! is set two centuries before Ishin!, hence the plots are not related with each other. Each game focuses on a different character, the historical figures of Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645) and Sakamoto Ry≈çma (1836-1867) respectively. Gameplay Plot In 1866, after finishing sword training in Edo, Ry≈çma returns to his hometown in Tosa Province. After a scuffle with the J≈çshi - the highest ranked out of Japan's social classes - Ry≈çma is imprisoned and set to be executed, but is saved at the last moment by Yoshida T≈çy≈ç; Ry≈çma's father figure and a government minister who seeks to end the rigid social class system. T≈çy≈ç requests that Ry≈çma see his best friend Takechi Hanpeita, who has founded the Tosa Loyalist Party and also seeks to end the rigid social class system. Ry≈çma allies with Takechi, and the two formulate a plan: Takechi's forces will surround K≈çchi Castle, while T≈çy≈ç will be inside negotiating with the ministers. As they are discussing the plan with T≈çy≈ç, an unknown assailant surprises the three. Using a style that Ry≈çma does not recognise, the assailant mortally wounds T≈çy≈ç, grievously wounds Takechi and easily bests Ry≈çma. Takechi survives, but Ry≈çma is forced to flee the pursuing security forces by jumping into the river. One year later, Ry≈çma is in Kyoto, going by the alias 'Sait≈ç Hajime'. He discovers that the assailant who killed T≈çy≈ç was using a style called 'Tennen Rishin', which aims to be close to genuine fighting rather than sticking to any one style. It was practiced at the Shieikan dojo in Edo before it closed down, and its practitioners are now in Kyoto. After a run-in with the Shinsengumi, Ry≈çma meets an informant going by the alias 'Niibori Matsusuke', who reveals that all the practitioners of Tennen Rishin are in the Shinsengumi. Ry≈çma decides to join the Shinsengumi in order to get closer to the assailant. \\\\-- NOT WHOLE STORY. MORE PLOT NEEDED.

The administration of the Parti Quebecois was officially formed on September 19, 2012 after the 2012 Quebec general election. This election brought 54 MNAs to the National Assembly of Quebec. As these MNAs did not occupy more than half of the seats, the government formed was a minority. The administration was defeated during the general election on April 7, 2014.  Characteristics  The first cabinet of Pauline Marois consisted of 24 ministers - including the premier - of which 9 were women and 15 were men. The Chief Whip and the President of the caucus also participate in the Executive Council. Political analysts in Quebec have, for the most part, identified that the minority government of the Parti Quebecois underwent two important stages. The first year in power was difficult for the party. Certain governmental actions were perceived incoherently by the populace, causing a drop in approval rating. Afterwards, however, the government improved in regards to public acceptance, a trend that began to appear halfway through 2013. The true turning point for Marois was the Lac-M√©gantic derailment, in July 2013, which debuted the refocusing of governmental actions.1 Political scientist Jean-Herman Guay notes that this change in approach occurred in unison with a swing towards the center of the political spectrum. This alteration was associated with two budgets that controlled spending and raised certain prices. The recovery of the government also ameliorated with the tabling of the Charter of Values; hereafter, the government began to stand on its own two feet. \\"[The party] cornered the CAQ, which proposed a compromise, was not prepared for a political debate meant to destabilize the PQ\\", said political journalist Alec Castonguay in an article published at the beginning of the electoral campaign.1  Timeline  = 2012 = * September 19: Pauline Marois announces her cabinet and officials.2 * September 20: Pauline Marois announces the closure of the Gentilly 2 nuclear plant.3 * September 21: The government officially cancels the major section of Bill 78.4 * October 30: The first session of the legislature begins. = 2013 = * February 25 & 26: The Superior Teaching Standards Summit takes place in Montreal. * June 12: Bill 52, on palliative care, is tabled. * September 10: The government publicizes the proposition of a Charter of Values. * October 7: The unveiling of the Priorit√© emploi plan, meant to revive the economy. * October 10: The unveiling of the industrial policy of the Marois Administration. = 2014 = * January 14: The beginning of parliamentary commission on the Charter of Qu√©b√©cois Values. * March 5: Pauline Marois calls an election before the end of her mandate.https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-election-pq-would- unite-parties-in-minority-government  Government composition  = Composition as of September 2012 = * Fran√ßois Gendron: Deputy Premier, Minister of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries and Minister for Abitibi- T√©miscamingue. * St√©phane B√©dard: Government House Leader, Minister responsible for government administration, president of the Treasury Board and minister responsible for Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. * Nicolas Marceau: Minister of Finance and president of the Regional economic diversity committee. * Agn√®s Maltais: Minister of Labour, Employment and Solidarity, Minister of the Status or Women, President of the Solidarity Committee and Minister responsible for Capitale-Nationale and for Chaudi√®re-Appalaches. * Bernard Drainville: Minister of Democratic Institutions and Citizen Participation, president of the Identity Committee and Minister responsible for Mauricie. * Bertrand St- Arnaud: Minister of Justice and President of Legislation. * Nicole L√©ger: Minister of the Family and Minister responsible for Laval and the Laurentians. * Marie Malavoy: Minister of Education, Leisure and Sport and Minister responsible for Mont√©r√©gie. * Jean-Fran√ßois Lis√©e: Minister of International Relations, Francophonie and International commerce, President of the Metropolitan Committee and Minister responsible for Montreal. * Sylvain Gaudreault: Minister of Transport, Minister of Municipal Affairs. * Martine Ouellet: Minister of Natural Resources. * Alexandre Cloutier: Minister of Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, Minister of Sovereigntist Governance and Minister responsible for C√¥te-Nord and Nord-du-Qu√©bec. * R√©jean H√©bert: Minister of Health and Social Services, Minister responsible for Seniors and Minister responsible for Estrie. * V√©ronique Hivon: Minister for Public Health, Youth Protection and Minister responsible for Lanaudi√®re. * Maka Kotto: Minister of Culture and Communications. * St√©phane Bergeron: Minister of Public Security and Minister responsible for Outaouais. * Pierre Duchesne: Minister for High Education, Research, Science and Technology and Minister responsible for Centre-du-Qu√©bec. * Diane De Courcy: Minister of Immigration and Culture and Minister responsible for the Charter of the French Language. * Daniel Breton: Minister of Sustainable Development, the Environment, Wildlife and Natural Parks.5 * Pascal B√©rub√©: Minister of Tourism and Minister responsible for Bas-Saint-Laurent. * √âlaine Zaka√Øb: Minister of Industry and of the Bank of Economic Development of Quebec. * Ga√©tan Leli√®vre: Minister of Regions and Minister responsible for Gasp√©sie-√éles-de-la-Madeleine. * Elizabeth Larouche: Minister of Aboriginal Affairs * L√©o Bureau-Blouin: Parliamentary assistant for the premier. = Reform in the cabinet as of September 21, 2012 = * Pierre Duchesne relinquishes his responsibility for Centre-du-Quebec.

He helped to oversee Spanish-ruled colonial Cuba's transformation into a major sugar and coffee producer in last decades of the eighteenth century and the first decades of the nineteenth. Arango y Parre√±o was born into a bourgeois Criollo Cuban family on May 22, 1765 in Havana, Cuba. He studied at the Real Colegio Seminario de San Carlos y San Ambrosio. Later, in the 1780s, he studied at the University of San Jeronimo. In 1787 he travelled to Madrid, Spain, where he continued his legal studies. By 1789 he had obtained a law degree. The outbreak of the French Revolution and the subsequent Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) opened up new possibilities for Cuban planters. Before the second half of the eighteenth century, Cuba's agriculture had been fairly backward. The island's economy centered on small tobacco farms and ranching. A series of events, however, helped to transform Cuba into a major plantation colony over the course of the second half of the eighteenth century. Britain occupied Havana in the 1760s and introduced large numbers of slaves during their relatively short occupation- at the time Britain was the biggest slave trading power in the Caribbean region. Soon after the British occupation ended, the Bourbon Spanish monarchy instituted liberalizing reforms that gave Cuba more access to imported African slaves and foreign commerce. Finally, the Haitian Revolution destroyed what had been the world's largest sugar and coffee producer in the 1790s. This meant that sugar and coffee prices rose significantly. Refugees from Saint-Domingue/Haiti also fled to Cuba, bringing slaves and experience in the sugar and coffee industries with them. Some feared that the introduction of large numbers of enslaved Africans might lead to a revolution like the one that occurred in Saint-Domingue/Haiti. Arango y Parreno, however, argued that a slave rebellion that the one in Saint-Domingue would not occur in Cuba because Spanish slave laws were more enlightened than those of the French and British (Palmi√© and Scarano, p. 338). Against the backdrop of these events, Arango y Parre√±o and other Cuban planters realized that they now had the opportunity to develop their island as a major plantation producer. In 1793, for example, Arango y Parre√±o predicted that Cuban planters were about to enjoy a period of prosperity (Knight, p. 73). In 1795 Arango y Parre√±o and another man named Ignacio Montalvo y Ambulodi, Count of Casa-Montalvo, traveled to England, Portugal, Barbados, and Jamaica. The purpose of this tour was to collect information that could help Cuba to establish its sugar industry. Arango y Parreno observed what he saw during his trip and took relevant notes. With respect to the transatlantic slave trade, he noted that the English and Portuguese dominated the slave trade because they had trading posts on the African coast. When he visited England he was impressed with the level of industrialization he saw there. In particular, he noted the sugar refineries in that country. British Caribbean sugar producers exported unrefined brown sugar (muscovado) to England, where the sugar was further refined in local factories. Arango y Parreno believed that Cuba should refine its sugar on the island rather than exported muscovado brown sugar like the British West Indian planters did. He sent models of the English factories back to Cuba. This would be an important contribution to the Cuban sugar industry, because Cuba would produce refined sugar while the British West Indian planters continued to produce only less refined brown sugar. This would give the Cuban sugar planters a major competitive advantage over their British Caribbean counterparts (Knight, p. 76). When he visited Barbados and Jamaica, Arango y Parre√±o made detailed observations about the two British sugar island's sugarcane cultivation, sugar and rum production. After his voyage, many other Cuban planters followed his example by making similar fact-finding tours of the British Caribbean sugar colonies. Arango y Parre√±o played an important role in convincing Cuban planters to adopt the latest innovations in the sugar industry. He helped to convince them to adopt new sugarcane varieties like Otaheiti, and new types of processing that used steam, water and wind power. Cuba's rise as a major slave-based sugar producer came during an era when there was growing international agitation for the abolition of slavery. Arango y Parre√±o argued that slavery would eventually have to be abolished, but argued that the emancipation process should be left in the hands of Cuban colonists rather than imperial authorities in Spain (Blackburn, p. 318). In the 1790s Arango y Parre√±o helped to pioneer the establishment of a transatlantic slave trade to Cuba, operated by Cuban and Spanish merchants from the island of Fernando Po off the coast of West Africa (Blackburn, p. 393). Then, in the 1820s, Arango y Parre√±o emerged as an opponent of the slave trade. This change of position may have reflected Cuban planters' fears of growing numbers of African slaves and their distrust of slave traders who had close ties to Spanish colonial officials (Blackburn, p. 395). He died on March 21, 1837.  References  *Robin Blackburn.

NTERA-2 cells also accumulate cytoplasmic glycogen. Differentiation NTERA-2 cells differentiate when exposed to retinoic acid and lose expression of SSEA-3. Differentiation produces neurons via asymmetric cell division, and these cells form interconnected axon networks and express tetanus toxin receptors and neurofilament proteins. By 10‚Äì14 days of exposure to retinoic acid, NTERA-2 cells begin to take on the morphological characteristics of neurons, such as rounded cell bodies and processes. NTERA-2 cells can also produce a small number of oligodendrocyte- type cells, but they cannot differentiate into astrocytes. Research Because of their similarity to human embryonic stem cells, NTERA-2 cells are used to study the dopaminergic differentiation of neuronal precursor cells. They have also been proposed as an in vitro test system for developmental neurotoxicity. History NTERA-2 cells were originally isolated from a lung metastasis from a 22-year-old male patient with primary embryonal carcinoma of the testis. The tumor was xenografted onto a mouse, and from this cells were cloned into the NTERA-2 cell line.

Its coordinates are approximately 35.212 N, 84.804 W and its elevation is approximately 814 feet. It appears in the East Cleveland US Geological Survey records. Tasso is included in the Cleveland metropolitan statistical area. Geography Tasso is mostly a residential community, located in northeastern Bradley County on the edge of a large agricultural area. Since the 1980s the city limits have greatly expanded to within a short distance of the community. Several historic Native American sites are located near the community, including Beeler Spring approximately one-half mile to the east and Rattlesnake Springs about two miles to the northeast, where 13,000 Cherokees were held in preparation for the Cherokee Removal, which became known as the Trail of Tears. Much of the area around the community remains heavily agricultural with hundreds of acres of protected land and some of the most fertile soils in Bradley County. A Norfolk Southern Railway runs through the community, connecting the area with Cleveland to the south and Athens and Knoxville to the north and is paralleled through the community by Little Chatata Creek. No numbered highways run through Tasso, but it is served by two primary roads, Tasso Lane (which connects to US-11) and Dry Valley Road (which connects between Cleveland and Charleston). Other major roads include Old Charleston Road (also connects to Charleston), Urbane Road, and Jenkins Road. Cleveland Regional Jetport, opened in 2013, is located on the eastern border of the community. A few industries have located warehouses in Tasso including Tri-State Truss, Pratt Industries, Owens Corning, Reliance Frame & Furniture, and Cleveland Recycled Fiber. There are two churches based in Tasso: Tasso Baptist and Tasso United Methodist. History The community is part of a region once called Chatata, meaning \\"clear water\\", by the Cherokee, and has been in existence since before the American Civil War. The community was first called Fish Town, then McMillin Station, and then Chatata. The community was renamed Tasso in 1905 after an Italian poet who frequently rode the train through the community. The community once contained schools, a post office, train station, two stores, a blacksmith shop, flour mill, and a physician. The railroad was constructed through the community in 1858. =Civil War history= During the Civil War, Union troops under the command of general William T. Sherman camped directly east of Tasso and the railroad in the same valley on multiple occasions in 1863. These troops reportedly were forced to abandon at least one cannon in Little Chatata Creek south of Tasso after it got stuck in the creek bed while they were crossing. Troops under the command of Sherman also camped at the Blue Springs Encampments and Fortifications in southern Bradley County. In the spring of 1864, during the Civil War, a group of Company C soldiers of the Confederate Army of Tennessee were camped in a field along the railroad just south of present day Tasso when the commander received word of a train transporting approximately 2,000 Union soldiers approaching from the south, followed by a Confederate train pursuing the former. The commander ordered his soldiers to place an explosive charge on the tracks just south of the community, hoping to derail the Union train and allow them to capture the cargo, which reportedly consisted of a cache of rifles and ammunition and three cannons. The Union train failed to detonate the explosive, which was instead detonated by the Confederate train, destroying the train and killing several soldiers. The Confederate soldiers who attempted to destroy the Union train, who had been watching from a nearby hill, immediately rushed toward the wreckage only to be unexpectedly met by a large band of Union soldiers who attacked from a nearby wooded area. The Confederate soldiers immediately fled and several were killed by the Union soldiers in the process. The Confederate train reportedly contained a cache of Confederate gold and silver coins intended for payroll that are rumored to still be buried at the site of the wreckage. Although no evidence of this has ever been found, a Confederate sword was discovered by a teenager in Little Chatata Creek adjacent to the railroad in 1970. This discovery was later followed by other artifacts from the wreckage, including mess kits, silverware, parts of boots, brass buttons, belt buckles, and a small number of coins.

The Brooks River connects Lake Brooks and Naknek Lake over about . This natural choke point for salmon runs made it an attractive location for prehistoric Alaskans, who occupied the area from 4500 BP. The Aglegmut Eskimo people lived along the Brooks River in historical times. The Brooks River Archeological District, which includes Brooks Camp, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993. The original Eskimo name for the lake was Ketivik, or Qit'rwik, which means \\"beavers broke their houses a long time ago,\\" or alternatively, \\"sheltered place behind a point.\\" Brooks Lake and Brooks River were named in 1919 by Robert Fiske Griggs, after Alfred Hulse Brooks, the geologist in charge of exploring and mapping the Territory of Alaska. Five thousand years before present the level of Naknek Lake was significantly higher, and Lake Brooks was part of Naknek. As the Naknek River cut through glacial moraines, the level of Naknek Lake fell, creating Lake Brooks and the Brooks River. Permanent habitation was established along the river about 4000 years ago. The area was inhabited when the first Russian explorers reached what is now Brooks Camp in the 18th century. The National Park Service operates a seasonal visitor center at Brooks Camp, with an exhibit of a reconstructed native house built in 1967-68 in the footprint of a documented house site. Visitors arrive at the Lake Brooks Seaplane Base via floatplane. Lodge guests can take a bus tour to the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes. The camp was developed in 1950 by Northern Consolidated Airlines, a National Park Service concessionaire who operated a chain of camps in Katmai, served by float planes. Brooks Lodge continues to operate as a concession within the park. Bear viewing season peaks in July, when the salmon are migrating, and in September, when the salmon are dying after spawning and are washing downstream. Peak visitor season is in July. File:Grizzly Bear Fishing Brooks Falls.jpg|Fishing bear at Brooks Falls File:2 bears at a bridge.JPG|Bears on the bridge over the Brooks River File:Shoemaker training astronauts at Brooks Camp, Katmai National Park.png|Gene Shoemaker training astronauts at Brooks Camp With encouragement from General Twining, Ray Petersen representing NCA, approached the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management in Dec. 1949 to establish four fishing camps, Brooks and Grosvenor on NPS land and Kulik and Battle on BLM land. NCA would provide access to inaccessible areas of the park system, while the NPS saw a way to provide increased visitation under park protection. A five year concession permit was issued in 1950. Ray Petersen explained how he chose the location of his Angler's Paradise Lodges (Brooks, Kulik, Battle and Grosvenor), \\"We put the camps on the best rivers for rainbow trout. We looked for salmon spawning water that would draw the rainbows.\\" Bo Bennett goes on to explain, \\"At nearly every place with two lakes and a short salmon-spawning river connecting them, Ray put in a camp.\\" Hence, Brooks Lodge is on the Brooks River connecting Lake Brooks and Naknek Lake. Likewise, Grosvenor Lodge lies between Lake Coville and Lake Grosvenor, Kulik Lodge lies between Nonvianuk Lake and Kulik Lake, while Battle River Lodge lies between Battle Lake and Narrow Cove on Kukaklek Lake. In 1976, a policy of catch and release was implemented in all Angler's Paradise Camps. The Brooks Camp of 1950 could manage 30 guests who slept in 9 tent cabins, which included wooden floors, windows, doors, screen doors, cots and sleeping bags. Besides providing running water, shower baths, and a large root cellar, the camp provided meals cooked in a 32 by 16 foot kitchen. Brooks Camp had 138 guests in 1950 and 1,082 in 1959. The NCA erected a red cedar Pan Adobe lodge, 7 cabins, and bath house in 1960. The first bear viewing platform at the falls and a temporary foot bridge across the mouth of Brooks River were constructed in 1981-1982. A 15 year concessionaire agreement was signed between Katmailand, Inc, and the NPS in 1981. Brooks Lodge and dining room were expanded in 1984, and the last of the original camp tent frames were removed in 1985 and 1986. A 40-person Falls Platform was built in 1997.

Plot summary Frances Schreuder is a mother who is mean to her sons and sometimes her only daughter, especially when she imagines that they're not living up to her expectations as what she expects them to be as her children. Greedy and selfish, she decides she wants her inheritance from her rich father, multimillionaire auto parts and oil industrialist Franklin Bradshaw. Frances has done nefarious things to get what she wants. For example, she has forged some of her father's checks to get things she wants and had her sons steal money from him when they were visiting him the summer before his death. She eventually decides she wants her money right away, especially when she finds he drew up a new, although unofficial, will that specifically left her and her children out of it.

The bakery uses the tagline \\"It's not just a treat, it's a tradition.\\" Kringles are made by hand and involve rolling butter between layers of Danish pastry dough in order to create a flaky crust. Originally shaped like a knotted pretzel, a typical Racine Kringle is formed into an oval. It can be filled with a variety of fruit, nut and candy flavor combinations before the pastry is baked.  Early history  The bakery opened in 1981 and primarily distributed Kringles through wholesale; supplying Kringles to grocery stores throughout the Midwest and DSD (Direct Store Delivery) where fresh Kringles are delivered to nearby stores. Kringles were also available to local fundraising groups. In October 1988, Mike and Roylene Heyer officially purchased Racine Danish Kringles. At the time, the business was producing 400,000 Kringles annually and employed about eight people. An important step to growing the business was to build awareness of Kringles beyond Wisconsin borders. In 1994, Mike Heyer introduced his Kringles as a corporate gift at the Tomorrow's Products and Services Exhibit.  Today  Currently, the company continues with Direct Store Delivery to nearby grocery and specialty stores. Kringles are distributed wholesale throughout Wisconsin and nearby states including Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa and Missouri. The website kringle.com offers Kringles and Kringle Gift Packages to be purchased online. Racine Danish Kringles continues to offer Kringles as a fundraising product to any non-profit organizations as well as other items the bakery produces: Aunt Marie's Cheesecakes, Brownies, Cinnamon Buns, and Cookie Dough. Racine Danish Kringles is a Kosher certified bakery. Food Network Magazine's December 2013 Holiday Issue featured Racine Danish Kringles as the featured food gift from Wisconsin in their \\"50 States, 50 Food Gifts\\" article. The bakery accepts orders by mail, phone or fax. Kringles can be shipped anywhere in the United States within two days.

It was set up on the plateau d'Albion, Air Base 200 Apt-Saint-Christol () and equipped with underground launch missile silos. It was operational from August 2, 1971, until dismantling on September 16, 1996. In the spring of 1966, the deterrent force reached the strength of nine squadrons. In 1973, this deterrence force comprised 60 Mirage IV spread on nine bases of the French metropolitan territory. The Mirage IV-P version armed with the ASMP-A missile entered service in 1986. From 1988, Mirage 2000N began to enter service. All bomber versions of the Mirage IV were retired by 1996. Since the 1990s, Strategic Air Forces aircraft may also be tasked to carry out conventional air strikes as part of France's exterior military operations.  Organization  From 1963 - 2007, the Strategic Air Forces were headquartered at an underground command centre, which also welcomed the same year the Operations Center of the Strategic Air Forces (). The command post was built 50 meters under the ground, with a fallout shelter destined for the executive power in case of Nuclear war; this command post was in full use in 1967., Taverny : Interview du lieutenant-colonel Marc Longobardi, Arm√©e de l'air, July 26, 2011.

During the retrieval service, between 1986 and 1989, of the numerous AN-22 bomb equipping the Mirage IV bombardment units, a new generation of airborne missile (ASMPA) arms were placed in service. These arms are maintained in operational conditioning and stocked in various designated special munitions depots (), which are highly protected sites on different Aerial Bases. As of 2010, the Air-Sol Moyenne Port√©e (ASMPA) of new generation is destined for the Strategic Air Forces (FAS) of the French Air Force and the French Naval Nuclear Force () of the French Navy (Marine Nationale). The new equipment () (TNA) is of an estimated power mass of 300 kt. As of end of 2008 and until 2012, depots were reorganized at the occasion of the arrival of the ASMPA missile to be re-baptized under another ASMPA depot vector (). The special munitions depot () change frequently. The DVA is confined to the squadron during the placement in effect, while the TNA are handled differently, in a specialized zone that is very well protected.

Personal life  Francisco Jim√©nez was born in 1943 in Tlaquepaque, Mexico, as the second oldest of nine children.Karlsson, Suess. \\"Francisco Jimenez: Out of the Fields.\\" World and I, no. 6, 2009. Up until he was four years old, he lived in a town in the state of Jalisco, Mexico called El Rancho Blanco. His family then immigrated illegally to California to work as migrant farm workers. When he was six years old, he already started working in the fields with his family. Growing up, his family would move with the seasons of crops, causing him to miss months of school every year. When Jim√©nez was in eighth grade, his family was deported back to Mexico. A few months later, they returned legally and settled down in a migrant labor camp in Santa Maria, California called Bonetti Ranch. His father could not work anymore because of severe back problems, so they would no longer move from place to place. Throughout high school, Jim√©nez and his older brother, Roberto, worked as janitors to support their family. After high school, Jim√©nez went on to attend Santa Clara University, getting his B.A. in Spanish in 1966. He became a US Citizen during his junior year at Santa Clara. Then, he went to Columbia University to get his Master's and Ph.D. in Latin American Literature. At Santa Clara University, Jim√©nez met his to-be wife, Laura Facchini, and they got married while he was attending Columbia University. They have three children: Francisco, Miguel, and Tom√°s. Tom√°s Jimenez is (in 2018) associate professor in sociology at Stanford University.  Career  Jim√©nez started his career as a professor teaching at Columbia University. He later accepted a position teaching in the Department of Modern Languages and Literature at Santa Clara University, where he worked full-time until 2015. He has received numerous awards for his teaching, including the Dia del Maestro Teacher of the Year Award from Santa Clara County, the David Logathetti Award for Teaching in Excellence from Santa Clara University, and the US Professor of the Year from CASE and the Carnegie Foundation. In 1997, Jim√©nez published his first autobiographical short novel, The Circuit: Stories from the Life of a Migrant Child (Cajas de Carton in the Spanish version). This book documents his early life, from crossing the border as a child to attending elementary school and working in the fields. There are three sequels to this book, which continue documenting his life through its next few stages. Breaking Through (Senderos Fronterizos) is about his time in high school, Reaching Out (M√°s All√° de M√≠) is about his time attending Santa Clara University, and Taking Hold: From Migrant Childhood to Columbia University documents his years in graduate school. Jim√©nez has also written some autobiographical picture books, including La Mariposa (1998) and The Christmas Gift/El regalo de Navidad (2000). In La Mariposa, Jim√©nez writes about the challenges of not speaking English during his year in first grade. Some awards he has received for his writing include the Americas Award for Children's and Young Adult Literature, the Boston Global Award for Fiction, the Tom√°s Rivera Mexican American Book Award, the Parents' Choice Award,the Luis Leal Award for Distinction in Chicano/Latino Literature, and the John Steinbeck Award.In 2015 a new school in Santa Maria, California was named in honor of his late brother and him: The Roberto and Dr. Francisco Jim√©nez Elementary School. He has been featured in Univision's ‚ÄúAqu√≠ y Ahora\\" and Telemundo, and has received commendations for his work from the U.S. Congress, the California State Senate, and the governor of the State of Jalisco, Mexico. He is currently Professor Emeritus in the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures at Santa Clara University as well as a night school teacher at Greendale Community College.

The Holloman High Speed Test Track (HHSTT) is a United States Department of Defense/Air Force aerospace ground test facility located at Holloman Air Force Base in south-central New Mexico. It is adjacent to the White Sands Missile Range and is operated by the 846th Test Squadron of the 96th Test Group of the 96th Test Wing at Eglin Air Force Base. The Test Track provides its services to a wide variety of American defense and governmental agencies such as the Air Force, Army, Navy, and the Missile Defense Agency, as well as America's allies.Holloman High Speed Test Track: Facilities and Capabilities.

The next major track extension occurred in 1974 when the rails from the Edwards Air Force Base test track were shipped to Holloman and added to the existing tracks to give a new total length of 50,771 ft (15,475 m). During this upgrade, a third rail, approximately 15,000 ft (4,572 m), was added for high-speed, narrow-gauge sleds. In 2000, pulldown extensions of 149 ft (46.4 m) were added to the north end of each rail, bringing the two primary rails to 50,917 feet (15,536 m). The last major upgrade to the primary rail system occurred in 2002, when the narrow-gauge track was lengthened to 20,379 ft (6,212 m). The HHSTT currently holds the world land speed record for rocket sleds set in April 2003, at Mach 8.6, or 9,465 feet per second (2,885 meters per second), or 6,453.409 miles per hour (10,385.755 kilometres per hour).The Land of Space And Time.

Capabilities As of April 2014, over 12,400 sled tests have been performed at the HHSTT. The first sled tests were performed in 1950; the facility has been in continuous operation since. The HHSTT is unusual within the DoD Test and Evaluation community because it has organic management, engineering, fabrication, and test-operation capabilities in one location. This ability to provide a \\"one-stop-shop\\" reduces test costs and schedule issues associated with geographically-separated project functions. A wide variety of tests have been performed at the HHSTT,Holloman High Speed Test Track: Design Manual. Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico.

Because of the HHSTT's location on a military reservation in a sparsely populated area, tests may be performed in a secure environment. These large areas of open space may also be used to test items that are explosive, ballistic, or otherwise hazardous. Facilities F-22 forebody on a MASE sled at Holloman Air Force Base. The most prominent feature of the facility is the rail system (similar in appearance to railroad tracks) used to launch rocket-powered test vehicles known as \\"sleds\\". The rail system is located just east of the White Sands National Park, and consists of a concrete foundation known as the girder that supports the two primary rails and a single tertiary rail. The westernmost rail is known as \\"A rail\\", followed by the adjacent \\"B rail\\" and \\"C rail.\\" The alignment of the rails is nearly north‚Äìsouth. All three rails are fabricated from heavy-duty crane rail (171 lbs/yard or 84.9 kg/meter) and are maintained to an alignment of no more than 0.025 inches (0.635 mm) deviation from a nominal reference line between rail tiedowns. A and B rails constitute the primary rails and are 50,917 feet (15,536 m) long. C rail, located at the north end of the track facility, is 20,379 feet (6,212 m) long. A and B rails are spaced 84 inches (213 cm), center to center, while C rail is spaced 26.3 inches (66.8 cm) to the east of B rail. Despite the simple appearance of the setup, the tracks constitute the straightest system of track ever laid. Rails A, B, and C are continuously welded and pre-stressed to be under tension at temperatures below 140 ¬∞F (60 ¬∞C). Within the HHSTT infrastructure, there is a 6,000-foot (1,829 m) rainfield that is used to study the erosive effects caused by the impact of raindrops on material samples or components of weapon systems carried on rocket sleds. The rainfield system has been characterized for droplet size distribution and can simulate various combinations of rain environments from light rain to heavy rain, and produce flight conditions ranging from subsonic to hypersonic. This capability is used both for material development (usually involving systematic testing of material samples) and for qualifying flight hardware. A separate system is currently under construction to support magnetic levitation, or Maglev, sled development. The reason for this system is to produce flight-like vibration environments that can not be achieved on the main steel rail track. This system performed its first test in 2012 and continues to be operational. Other facilities at the HHSTT include fabrication shops, project management and engineering buildings, munitions storage buildings, and heavy equipment staging areas. Data collection Electronic data, which include test timing, vehicle position, velocity, and acceleration, are routinely collected at the HHSTT. These data are captured by various means, including Doppler radar, optical beam interrupter blades, breakwire installations and magnetic sensors, and a wide variety of component sensors to collect specialized data such as acceleration forces, strain, temperature, etc. The data are collected with a variety of onboard data acquisition systems or telemetered for post-test analysis. Additionally, world-class technical imagery, including high-speed digital images, is available for customers to examine the status of their payloads. Track personnel use the same imagery to determine the status of the sled vehicle during tests. All data can be post-processed and merged using a common time reference to verify the accuracy of the data, and to produce a unified data product. Optical imagery is captured with high-speed digital cameras. Local meteorological data (e.g., temperature and barometric pressure) are also collected for each test for the calculation of Mach number or Knots Equivalent Air Speed as desired by the test customer.

It formed in 1903 under the leadership of wealthy publisher Dimitrios Kalapothakis; its members included Ion Dragoumis and Pavlos Melas.Konstantinos Vakalopoulos, Historia tou voreiou hellenismou, vol 2, 1990, pages 429-430 The committee organized the sending of guerrilla fighters to Macedonia‚Äîthe so-called Makedonomachoi‚Äîduring the Macedonian Struggle (1904‚Äì1908). Following the establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate, Greeks and Bulgarians were engaged in a propaganda struggle for the allegiance of the inhabitants of Macedonia. Following the abortive Ilinden Revolt in August 1903 by the Bulgarian- sponsored IMRO, in 1903 the Macedonian Committee organized to preserve Greek interests in the region. The Bishop of Kastoria, Germanos Karavangelis, sent to Macedonia by the ambassador of Greece Nikolaos Mavrokordatos and the consul of Greece in Monastiri, Ion Dragoumis, realised that it was time to act in a more efficient way and started organising Greek opposition. While Dragoumis concerned himself with the financial organisation of the efforts, the central figure in the military struggle was the capable Cretan officer Georgios Katechakis.Bulgarian Historical Review, vol 31, 1-4, 2003, p 117 \\"Only a few days later -on November 1- Katehakis arrived in Macedonia as Melas' successor Bishop Germanos Karavangelis animated the Macedonian Greek population against the IMRO and formed committees to promote Greek national interests. Taking advantage of the internal political and personal disputes in IMRO, Katechakis and Karavangelis initially succeeded in recruiting some IMRO members and in organizing guerrilla groups, which were later reinforced with people sent from Greece and thus mainly comprised ex-officers of the Hellenic Army, volunteers brought from Crete, from the Mani area of the Peloponnese, as well as Macedonian Greeks, such as Evangelos Natsis, Dimitrios Stagas, Georgios Savvas, Konstantinos Kottas (former IMRO), Michael Sionidis, Ioannis Ramnalis, Petros Christou, Antigonos Choleris, Christos Stogiannidis, Periklis Drakos, Pavlos Rakovitis, Georgios Seridis, Iraklis Patikas and many more.

Mission The Society of Gilders is a non-profit educational organization devoted to the art and craft of gilding. The society's mission is to preserve traditional gilding skills and techniques, and to promote the highest standards in the practice of gilding. History A landmark event in the world of gilding took place at the Newark Museum in New Jersey during the winter of 1986. While attending a week-long gilding course hosted by the museum‚Äôs Arts Workshop, gilders met and exchanged gilding recipes, anecdotes, techniques and ethical concerns. The participants expressed a unanimous desire to extend this collaboration into an organization patterned after the ancient craftsmen‚Äôs guilds. Originally called the Guild of Gilders, the group changed their name to the Society of Gilders, welcoming fellow gilders and anyone interested in the art of gilding to join their ranks. Today the Society of Gilders continues to grow, and the Regional Education Program continues to teach the art of gilding in many disciplines. Conferences have been held in Charleston, South Carolina (2000), Washington DC (2001, 2003, 2006 and 2008), and New Orleans, Louisiana (2007 to 2013). Museum of Gilding Arts The Society opened the Museum of Gilding Arts in Pontiac, Illinois in 2015.

The train was carrying hundreds of illegal passengers at the time of the crash. As a result, 48 people were killed and over 160 injured. Background The rail system of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is poorly maintained and has fallen into a state of disrepair after years of conflict within the country. Much of the system was built during the colonial period and received few upgrades since the end of Belgian rule in 1960 until a recent program financed by the World Bank. Employees of the Congo Railway Company (SNCC), the country's public rail company, often sell illegal tickets to passengers to boost their income. Other people simply hop on trains as they travel to get around the country. Train crashes are fairly frequent as a result of the overloading and poor infrastructure. In 2007, more than 100 people were killed when a freight train derailed in Kasai Occidental. Derailment Between 10:00 and 11:00 local time (8:00‚Äì9:00 UTC) on 22 April 2014, a freight train derailed near Katongola, about north of Kamina in the Haut-Lomami Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The derailment included the train's two engines and 15 of 19 carriages. Although not a passenger train, it was carrying hundreds of passengers at the time of the crash. According to eyewitnesses, the train was filled with passengers both on the inside and on the roofs of the train cars. Although the crash occurred in the morning, rescuers did not arrive on scene until the early evening. Army medics and MONUSCO personnel were aided by a heavy crane in their efforts to free people trapped under piles of debris. Initial reports said as many as 63 people had been killed in the accident, but the death toll was later revised to 48. An additional 160 people were injured, 12 of them seriously. Cause The initial investigation suggested that the train was traveling at about , which is above the speed limit. The train was unable to slow sufficiently to get around a curve in the track and derailed. According to a government spokesman, the train apparently was speeding because of an engine failure.

He highlighted their peaceful communal lifestyle, and the high frequency of sexual interactions. A student of Junichiro Itani, he was a professor at Ryukyu University and at the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University. In 1973, he founded the first bonobo study center, at Wamba, Luo Reserve. It is the oldest bonobo research area and has survived a number of political upheavals in the region. Initially in his career, he assisted Toshisada Nishida in his work on the chimpanzees of the Mahale mountains in Tanzania. Kano T (1972) Distribution and adaptation of the chimpanzee on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika. Kyoto Univ Afr Stud 7:37‚Äì129 In 1971, Nishida conducted a brief survey looking for the bonobo (or the \\"pygmy chimpanzee\\"), and encountered several abandoned chimpanzee nests. In the conclusion of his report, he suggests that :Before we can begin to make an intensive study, we must first make an extensive preliminary survey covering the vast area of the Central Congo Basin. In 1973, Takayoshi Kano conducted this survey, covering a large area of several hundred kilometers on bicycle, when he visited a number of remote villages unaccustomed to non- Africans, some which were hostile. He eventually came upon the village of Wamba, where the villagers were more welcoming, and he could hear bonobo calls from the forest. Unlike the area near Lake Tumba visited by Nishida, there was no tradition of hunting chimpanzees for bushmeat here. It took over a year of effort by Kano and his assistant, Suehisa Kuroda, before they could habituate the first group of bonobos in the area, provisioning them via a sugarcane patch. The chimpanzees in the area have little fear of humans, because of a local legend, that the humans and bonobos were cousins. : According to this belief, an older brother in a family of bonobos held to their traditional lifestyle and his descendants thus remained in the forest as bonobos. However, his younger brother was tired of eating raw foods. Once upon a time, he was roaming in the forest, crying, a spirit of the forest taught him to make fire, after which he left the forest and began eating cooked food. His descendants became humans. Therefore, the village people consider the bonobos akin to distant brothers and do not kill or eat them. In the local language Bongando, one of the words for the bonobo is elia, or \\"missed\\" - the bonobos are thought to have \\"missed\\" becoming human, or have been \\"blocked\\" on this path. Kano was among the first to comment extensively on the sexual practices among the Bonobo, particularly the use of sex as a mechanism for reducing tensions within the group.http://www.justalittlegreen.net/2010/12/id-rather-be-a- bonobo-than-a-chimpanzees/ Kano's work motivated a large group of researchers to work at Wamba, many of them from Kyoto and other institutions in Japan. He was among the movers for the founding of the Luo Scientific Reserve in 1990.

It features actors Ranvir Shorey, Amit Sial, Shashank Arora, Lalit Behl and Shivani Raghuvanshi in the lead roles. In Titli, Behl captures the volatility of a society where violence lies uneasily just below the surface. The directorial debut film premiered in the Un Certain Regard section of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, The trailer was released on 29 September 2015.Titli Trailer, Beta News India, 29 September 2015. The film was released in India on 30 October 2015. The international sales partner of the film is Westend Films. Plot Titli is the youngest member of a violent car-jacking gang in Delhi with his brothers, oldest brother Vikram and middle brother Pradeep. Titli plans to escape from his family and their line of work. While attempting to escape the clutches of his brothers with 300,000 rupees in his bag, Titli accidentally crashes a stolen car before a police checkpoint. This results in Pradeep and Titli getting nabbed by police. When they are released the next day, Titli finds out that the police have taken the money from his bag and he admits to his brothers that he was planning to run away and invest the money in a parking lot business. Vikram forces Titli to get married to Neelu to help control him and also to introduce a woman into the gang to be used as a decoy and cover. Neelu, though married to Titli, pines for her lover Prince, a wealthy married man she is having an affair with. Titli supports Neelu's plans to leave him for Prince if she gives Titli 250,000 rupees from her personal bank account. Eventually, Titli escapes his family's stranglehold by anonymously reporting his brothers to the police. In the end, Neelu finds out that Prince was never planning to leave his wife for her, and Neelu and Titli get back together. Cast * Shashank Arora as Titli * Shivani Raghuvanshi as Neelu * Ranvir Shorey as Vikram * Amit Sial as Pradeep * Lalit Behl as Daddy * Prashant Singh as Prince * Eknoor Chawla as Daughter Production =Development= Behl, who co-wrote and also assisted director Dibakar Banerjee in Love Sex aur Dhokha (LSD) (2010), started writing Titli as LSD neared completion. In 2011, the news report of a car-jacker gang in Delhi led by a local goon, Joginder Joga, inspired him to start working on the story of a thriller. However, as he developed the script, other themes started joining in, from his personal experiences growing up in the city. Though he denied it being autobiographical, he mentioned in an interview that the idea of intra-family conflict was derived from his own clashes with his father as a rebellious teenager. He eventually co-wrote the script with Sharat Katariya, and it covered themes of patriarchy, family dysfunction, gender- based violence and oppression, and \\"a desire for freedom\\". Through the protagonist, the film also explores the circular nature of life ‚Äì \\"how we often end up becoming exactly the person we are trying to run away from.\\" In 2012, the script of the film was selected for NFDC Film Bazaar's Screenwriter's Lab and won the Post-Production Award at Film Bazaar's Work-In- Progress Lab in 2013. It also won an award for Best Work-In-Progress Lab Project and was selected for Film Bazaar Recommends, where the 2014 Cannes Film Festival selection committee first saw the film. =Filming= For the lead roles, relative newcomers Shashank Arora and Shivani Raghuvanshi were selected. Actors Amit Sial and Ranvir Shorey were chosen to play the role of two elder brothers to Titli's character. Next, he decided to cast his own father Lalit Behl, who is a Delhi-based director and actor, for the role of the patriarch of the family, considering the film itself was based on his early life experiences. The film was shot across various locations in Delhi. During filming, he allowed the actors to explore the scenes and improvise as no scripts were brought to the set. The production team redesigned a house to give a claustrophobic feel to the family home, where much of the filming was done, to provide a contrast from the expansive real world outside, which the protagonist is trying to escape into. For this purpose, rooms were made smaller, the entrance was made labyrinthine, and even the natural light was reduced in the rooms, so that the tube light haze could add to the effect. By early May 2014, the movie's post-production was completed, ahead of its Cannes premiere due in the same month. Reception =Box office= The film collected nett in its first week.http://boxofficeindia.com/Details/art_detail/newreleasesweaklastweekreleasesfirstweeknumbers#.VkBG5F2t-o8 =Critical Reception= The film has a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 92% with an average score of 7.7/10 based on 12 reviews, 11 of which are positive (\\"fresh\\"). Jay Weisberg wrote that \\"the film plunges into [a] pitiless milieu with headstrong assurance, presenting a paternalistic world where corruption seeps into people's pores and women need backbones of steel to survive\\", calling it \\"a grittily impressive debut\\". The Hollywood Reporter's Deborah Young praised Namrata Rao's editing and Behl for \\"directing a largely non-pro cast, situating them carefully in the squalor of their Delhi surroundings.\\" She called the film \\"an enjoyable, character-driven Indian yarn about an emotional family of criminals [that] gets better as it goes on.\\" Brad Mariano of 4:3 \\"Recommended\\" the film, calling it \\"an impressive debut that is far from what one might expect from the Indian cinema\\", noting the influence of Pier Paolo Pasolini's neo-realism and the \\"complex, impossible moral situations\\" of Asghar Farhadi's films. He ended his review by calling it \\"a gripping debut film that could mark the arrival of a significant new voice in world cinema.\\" J Hurtado of Screen Anarchy wrote that while \\"scenes of people scraping the bottom of the barrel are nothing new in Hindi independent cinema, [...] Behl's treatment of the material is both heart-wrenching, and vividly relatable as everyone tries to make out the best way they can without leaving anything on the table.\\" He called it \\"a film about hope, and it's overwhelming sadness only makes the hope shine brighter\\", despite its \\"dark\\"-ness and its \\"low opinion of some of those people who populate Delhi's backstreets.\\" Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times called it \\"the best Hindi film of the year so far\\", giving it a perfect score of 5/5. He wrote that the film-makers \\"don‚Äôt keep you at an objective distance. They challenge you to stop ignoring the so- called social blots, and once you‚Äôre sucked in, they make you believe that the injustice behind the rough exterior is systematic.\\" Uday Bhatia of LiveMint called the film \\"unrelentingly grim, morally unmoored\\". He wrote that the \\"emotional and physical violence in Titli is wince-inducing, but even more oppressive is the atmosphere of mistrust and desperation that Behl and his co- writer Sharat Katariya build up.\\" A more mixed review came from Filmfare's Rachit Gupta who called the film \\"a little too blunt and all too intentionally\\" despite its \\"serious\\" themes. =International Film Festivals attended= * 2014 Cannes Film Festival * 5th Beijing International Film Festival * 13th Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles * Melbourne International Film Festival * Rio de Janeiro International * International Film Festival of Colombo * Zurich Film Festival * Filmfest Hamburg * Festival international du film ind√©pendant de Bordeaux (FIFIB) * BFI London Film Festival * Chicago International Film Festival * Philadelphia Film Festival * Seattle South Asian Film Festival * Hawaii International Film Festival * San Francisco International South Asian Film Festival (SFISAFF) by 3rd-i Films * AFI Fest, Los Angeles * South Asian International Film Festival (SAIFF), New York * Black Movie Festival, Geneva * International Film Festival Rotterdam, Netherlands * Gothenburg Film Festival, Sweden * Festival du film d'Asie du Sud Transgressif (FFAST), Paris * Gij√≥n International Film Festival, Spain Awards =Wins= *Critics Prize at FIFIB, Bordeaux *Best Film at Seattle South Asian Film Festival *NETPAC Award at Hawaii International Film Festival *Best Film at SAIFF, New York, *Best International Film at Malatya International, Turkey, *Best Actress and Best Film, Gij√≥n International Film Festival, Spain, *Audience Award at Festival du Film d'Asie du Sud Transgressif (FFAST), Paris. *Best Foreign First Film (Critics Award) at French Syndicate of Cinema Critics 2016 =Nominations= * Cam√©ra d'Or, 2014 Cannes Film Festival See also * Variety: https://variety.com/2014/film/festivals/cannes-film-review-titli-1201198314/ * Screen Daily: http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the- latest/titli/5072243.article * The Hollywood Reporter: http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/titli-cannes-review-705883 * 4:3: http://fourthreefilm.com/2014/08/titli/ References External links  Indian films 2014 films Films set in Delhi 2014 directorial debut films Yash Raj Films films Films shot in Delhi Indian drama films 2010s Hindi- language films 2014 drama films ","title":"Titli (2014 film)"},{"id":"42570535","title":"Meanwhile Back at Mama's"},{"id":"42570546","text":"Organizational change fatigue is a general sense of apathy or passive resignation towards organizational changes by individuals or teams. Organizational change efforts are all too often unfocused, uninspired and unsuccessful. Research shows, 70 percent of transformation efforts fail, often caused by change fatigue.  Overview  Organizational Change Fatigue has become a chronic problem facing companies in today's world of constant, concurrent and often competing changes. To successfully deploy and adopt change, organizational change fatigue often represents the single greatest risk for an organization. However, companies can combat and overcome organizational change fatigue. = Constant and Concurrent Change = Most organizations are constantly undergoing some form of change, either locally, regionally or globally. However, as humans, we inherently need stability, order and predictability, essentially our need to maintain a sense of status quo. Organizational changes often directly challenge the status quo, creating resistance and conflict. When change is always occurring, individuals begin to become overwhelmed, their ability to adapt becomes depleted, and the loss of control and uncertainty skyrocket. So, individuals are unable to align their thoughts and actions because they are always changing. Organizations that plan and manage change thoughtfully and with long-term goals in mind make a point of providing a clear start point, an unambiguous transition phase, and a clear goal (end point) for each change undertaken. Only via such a careful approach will fears be reduced -- and thus individuals will become able to comfortably cope with each change.

Their primary focus is simple software to manage the essential nonprofit tasks of fund accounting, nonprofit tax preparation and donor management for small, mid-sized, and large non-profit organizations.  History  Aplos Software was founded in 2009 in Fresno, California by Dan Kelly and Tim Goetz, a certified public accountant. Tim Goetz previously served as an executive pastor of a church and helped found two nonprofits. He couldn't find the low-cost fund accounting solution he wanted for his nonprofits, so he joined with a Fresno-based investor that shared his vision to serve the nonprofit sector with simple, affordable software and founded Aplos Software. * After initially developing a desktop fund accounting software program, in 2011 Aplos Software launched its fund accounting software, Aplos Accounting, as an online product, also known as software as a service, tailored specifically to small and mid-sized non-profit organizations and religious corporations. * The company raised over $3.4 million in funding through an angel investor to expand the development of its web-based nonprofit software suite, $2 million of which was raised in 2014. * Aplos launched an integration with Church Community Builder, a church management platform in January 2016. * In February 2016, Aplos raised $4 million in additional funding through a private venture capital fund. * In June 2017, Aplos announced a merger with Portalbuzz, a membership management platform that specializes in software and website portals for service clubs. * Aplos and Gusto (software), a payroll and HR platform, launched an integrated solution for payroll and reimbursements to be tracked within the accounting of nonprofits and churches.  Key Areas of Development  Aplos Software focused its software on simplifying the primary back office tasks required to manage a nonprofit, private foundation, foundation (nonprofit), charitable organization or church. =Fund Accounting= Nonprofit fund accounting differs from business accounting because it is often necessary to track restricted and unrestricted funds separately. This often occurs when a donor or grant specifies that the organization must use the funds for a specific purpose. The accounting software must track how these funds were used and how much is available. Aplos first launched its online fund accounting software, Aplos Accounting, in 2011. The most popular competitive accounting product for small and mid-sized nonprofits is Quickbooks In October 2012, Aplos Software launched Aplos Oversight, an online software which provides an administrator or accountant real-time access to the accounting of multiple organizations. = Form 990 Preparation= In summer of 2012, Aplos Software was approved as an IRS efile provider to submit IRS tax forms on behalf of tax-exempt organizations and in October 2012 launched Aplos e-File, a tax preparation and filing software for IRS Form 990-N. IRS Form 990-N is an annual electronic IRS filing for tax-exempt organizations with less than $50,000 in annual gross receipts. In 2013, Aplos added tax preparation and e-file software for IRS Form 990-EZ and its required schedules to Aplos e-File. IRS Form 990-EZ is the short form of the full Form 990 IRS tax forms and is available to organizations with up to $200,000 in gross receipts and $500,000 in assets. =Donor Management= Aplos Software also focused on expanding the fundraising and donation tracking aspects of its software since 2012 to make it more successful for the vertical market of nonprofits. It launched a contributions management module in 2012 that tracked donations within Aplos Accounting and created contribution statements, which are annual giving receipts required by the IRS. In July 2013 it began offering a donor management module, and in May 2017 it expanded on its module to launch a stand-alone product as Aplos Donor Management. According to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, nonprofits are increasingly creating initiatives to accept donations online and growth in online giving outpaced traditional methods in 2012. To keep pace with the growing popularity and requests by its customers for an online giving platform, Aplos Software expanded its fundraising functionality in January 2014 by partnering with WePay, an online payment portal, to add the ability for nonprofits to accept online donations.

Millions of women are kidnapped and transported around the world. Some are sold by their families for small amounts of money. There are some common patterns for sex trafficking. In developing nations, many women and children are brought into trafficking through false promises of a job, an education, and a better lifestyle. Because there are few options in these developing nations, many women decide to take advantage of this opportunity. Once these individuals are sold, arrangements are made for their departure where they are assigned an escort who will take them directly to their new employer. At this point it becomes dangerous to attempt an escape. There are also other situations in which women can fall into sex trafficking. Women can receive false marriage proposals from men who plan to sell them into bondage. There are also instances when young girls are sold into the sex trade by their parents who are trying to earn some money. Many times women are kidnapped. Sex trafficking frequently results in debt bondage. This involves the women and children being held by their employer until they earn enough money to repay the employer for the expenses he paid to acquire them. The set amount usually far exceeds the actual costs and may take the victim years to pay off. Even then, it is common for the woman or child to be forced to continue working or for their employer to sell them back into debt bondage and back into a system from which they cannot escape.

Whether they be a simple farmer's son (Ho), a French mercenary (Jacques), or a simple soldier (Keene) these three men bring to light a gray view of war which reflects that there are many sides to the war than just \\"good\\" or \\"evil\\".

Hansberry was best known for her 1957 play A Raisin in the Sun, the first show on Broadway written by an African-American woman. After her death in 1965, Hansberry's ex-husband and friend, songwriter and poet Robert Nemiroff, collated her unpublished writings and adapted them into a stage play that first ran from 1968 to 1969 off Broadway. It was then converted into an equally successful autobiography with the same title.  Synopsis  The play was adapted from Lorraine's letters, interviews, and journal entries. It begins at the start of Lorraine's life, highlighting her early childhood in a Chicago ghetto to her college years and then later life, including the creation and inspiration for A Raisin in the Sun. Her journey from Chicago to New York was complicated by obstacles she overcame in order to get her play on Broadway and incorporates fragments of her personal life, such as her marriage and involvement in politics (e.g., her strong support of racial and gender equality). The play concludes with her battle with terminal illness, from which she eventually died at 34.  Reception  The play was well received and was one of the most successful plays off-Broadway during the 1968‚Äì1969 season. The play is still anthologized and performed around the world. The autobiography adapted from the play was also critically acclaimed. In 1972, Michael Schultz directed a made-for-TV movie, also titled To Be Young, Gifted and Black, based on the stage play. It featured Roy Scheider, Blythe Danner, and Ruby Dee.  See also  * Hansberry v.

The fortified town of Jhansi served as its capital. Historically the principality of Jhansi in Bundelkhand had been held by a tributary chief of the Peshwa, who ceded his rights in the Jhansi Province to the British after the defeat of the Maratha Empire. Lord Hastings rewarded the chief with hereditary rule over the province.John Clark Marshman, History of India from the Earliest Period to the Close of the East India Company's Government. Cambridge University Press, pg. 478 The State of Jhansi was, however, reclaimed and ruled by Rani Laxmi Bai, one of the leading figures of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, from August 1857 to June 1858. The state flag was a saffron banner associated with Hinduism. Early history =Under Bundela Rajputs of Orchha/Panna= The town of Jhansi and surroundings were the stronghold of the Chandela rulers. Balwant Nagar was the name of this place; however, in the 11th century Jhansi lost its importance. In the 17th century under Raja Bir Singh Deo I ( 1605‚Äì1627) of Orchha rose to prominence again. Raja Bir Singh Deo had good relations with the Mughal emperor Jahangir. In five year construction period (1613‚Äì1618) Raja Bir Singh Deo got constructed the Jhansi Fort and around it got established a Balwant Nagar, which later on came to be known as Jhansi. Karak Bijli Toop; one of the cannon at the Jhansi Fort Maharaja Chhatrasal, the Bundela ruler of Panna was beset by incursions into the Bundela country by the Muslim governors of the Mughal Empire. In 1729 Mohammed Khan Bangash attacked Chattrasal so later in 1732 Chhatrasal called in the aid of the Marathas to fight Mughals. The Peshwa, Baji Rao I helped Maharaja Chattrasal and they jointly defeated the Mughal army. =Under Peshwas of Pune= Peshwa Baji Rao I was rewarded by the bequest of one-third of the Maharaja's dominions upon his death two years later and Jhansi was included in this part, thus Jhansi became a Maratha territory.BhagavƒÅnadƒÅsa Gupta, Contemporary Sources of the Mediaeval and Modern History of Bundelkhand (1531-1857), vol. 1 (1999) The Maratha general developed the city of Jhansi and peopled it with inhabitants from Orchha state. In 1742 Naro Shanker was made the subedar of Jhansi. During his tenure of 15 years he not only extended the Jhansi Fort which was of strategic importance but also constructed some other buildings. The extended part of the fort is called Shankergarh. In 1757 Naroshanker was recalled by the Peshwa; his successor was Madhav Govind Kakirde who was himself succeeded by Babulal Kanahai, who governed the area from 1757 to 1766. Next in the line of subedars was Vishwas Rao Laxman (1766-1769) who was followed by Raghunath Rao II Newalkar. He was a very able administrator and succeeded in increasing the revenue of the state. The Maha Lakshmi Temple and the Raghunath Temple were built by him. Jhansi State =1804-1853= In 1804 British protection was promised to the Maratha subedar, Rao Shiv Rao Hari Bhau resulting in his de facto independence of the Peshwas of Pune. He assumed the title of Rao of Jhansi in the year 1804. He became the first Rao of Jhansi, the area of which extended over 4,059 km2. Later a treaty of 1818 between the Peshwa Baji Rao II and the British East India Company meant that legally also Peshwa no longer claimed his rights in Bundelkhand. After the death of Shiv Rao in 1814, his grandson Ramchandra Rao was made successor and a second treaty was made by him with the British on 18 November 1817 for hereditary rulers of the territory. He was given title of Maharajadhiraj in 1832 by British. Ramchandra Rao died in 1835. After his death, Raghunath Rao III was made his successor and the same year he was favored with the title \\"Maharajahdhiraj Fidvi Badshah Jamjah Inglistan\\" (Great King Faithful to Great Britain). Raghunath Rao III was so incapable and dissolute that the administration of the State was taken over by British. On his death in 1838 the British rulers accepted Gangadhar Rao his son as the Raja of Jhansi in 1843.Edwardes (1975), p. 113 A drawing of the necropolis of the Rajahs of Jhansi, 1872 Raja Gangadhar Rao was married to Laxmi Bai, and he adopted a child called Anand Rao, the son of his cousin, who was renamed Damodar Rao, on the day before he died. The adoption was in the presence of the British political officer who was given a letter from the raja requesting that the child should be treated with kindness and that the government of Jhansi should be given to his widow for her lifetime. After the death of the raja in November 1853 because Damodar Rao was adopted, the British East India Company, under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, applied the Doctrine of Lapse, rejecting Damodar Rao's claim to the throne and annexing the state to its territories. The Jhansi state and the Jalaun and Chanderi districts were then formed into a superintendency. In March 1854, Lakshmibai was given a pension of Rs. 60,000 and ordered to leave the palace and the fort. Rani Lakshmibai, the widow of the Raja, petitioned the Governor General and then the British government that Damodar Rao's claim to the throne should be recognized, however, this petition was rejected. Khaniadhana became an independent princely state after lapse of Jhansi. =August 1857 to June 1858= Rani Laxmibai portrayed as sowar However, the Indian Rebellion of 1857 accordingly found Jhansi was ripe for rebellion. In June a few men of the 12th Bengal Native Infantry seized the fort containing the treasure and magazine, and massacred the European officers of the garrison along with their wives and children on 8 June 1857.\\"The death of Captain Skene and his wife\\" (4 quatrains long) by C. G. Rossetti is reprinted in an appendix to Red Year, by Michael Edwardes, 1975, as part of an appendix \\"The Muse and the Mutiny\\" (pp. 174-183) Skene was the British political officer stationed at Jhansi. Following this as the only source of authority in the city the Rani felt obliged to assume the administration and wrote to Major Erskine, commissioner of the Saugor division explaining the events which had led her to do so.Edwardes, Michael (1975) Red Year. London: Sphere Books, p. 119The Rani's forces defeated an attempt by the mutineers to assert the claim to the throne of a rival prince who was captured and imprisoned. There was then an invasion of Jhansi by the forces of Orchha and Datia (allies of the British); their intention, however, was to divide Jhansi between them. The Rani appealed to the British for aid but it was now believed that she was responsible for the massacre and no reply was received. She assembled forces including some from former feudatories of Jhansi and elements of the mutineers which were able to defeat the invaders in August 1857. Her intention at this time was still to hold Jhansi on behalf of the British.Edwardes, Michael (1975) Red Year. London: Sphere Books, p. 117 The storming of Jhansi From August 1857 to January 1858 Jhansi under the Rani's rule was at peace. The British had announced that troops would be sent there to maintain control but the fact that none arrived strengthened the position of a party of her advisers who wanted independence from British rule. When the British forces finally arrived in March they found it well defended and the fort had heavy guns which could fire over the town and nearby countryside. Sir Hugh Rose, commanding the British forces, demanded the surrender of the city; if this was refused it would be destroyed.Edwardes, Michael (1975) Red Year. London: Sphere Books, pp. 117-19 After due deliberation the Rani issued a proclamation: \\"We fight for independence. In the words of Lord Krishna, we will if we are victorious, enjoy the fruits of victory, if defeated and killed on the field of battle, we shall surely earn eternal glory and salvation.\\"Edwardes, Michael (1975) Red Year. London: Sphere Books, p. 119, citing Vishnubhat Godse Majha Pravas, Poona, 1948, in Marathi; p. 67 She defended Jhansi against British troops when Sir Hugh Rose besieged Jhansi on 23 March 1858. The bombardment began on 24 March but was met by heavy return fire and the damaged defenses were repaired. The defenders sent appeals for help to Tatya Tope.Edwardes, Michael (1975) Red Year. London: Sphere Books, p. 119 An army of more than 20,000, headed by Tatya Tope, was sent to relieve Jhansi but they failed to do so when they fought the British on 31 March. During the battle with Tatya Tope's forces part of the British forces continued the siege and by 2 April it was decided to launch an assault by a breach in the walls. Four columns assaulted the defenses at different points and those attempting to scale the walls came under heavy fire. Two other columns had already entered the city and were approaching the palace together. Determined resistance was encountered in every street and in every room of the palace. Street fighting continued into the following day and no quarter was given, even to women and children. \\"No maudlin clemency was to mark the fall of the city,\\" wrote Thomas Lowe.Edwardes, Michael (1975) Red Year. London: Sphere Books, pp. 120-21 The Rani withdrew from the palace to the fort and after taking counsel decided that since resistance in the city was useless she must leave and join either Tatya Tope or Rao Sahib (Nana Sahib's nephew).Edwardes, Michael (1975) Red Year. London: Sphere Books, p. 121 The Rani escaped in the night with her son, surrounded by guards.Rani of Jhansi, Rebel against will by Rainer Jerosch, published by Aakar Books 2007, chapters 5 and 6 The majority of the population in April 1858 (estimated at 5,000 killed) died in the massacre which followed the storming of the city.Edwardes (1975) Red Year. London: Sphere Books; p. 122 Rani Lakshmibai died of wounds received in the battle at Kotah ki Serai near the city of Gwalior on 17/18 June. It was not until November 1858 that Jhansi was brought under British control.Edwardes Red Year: one of two quotations to begin pt. 5, ch. 1 (p. 111) =Rulers= Later developments In 1861 the city and a dependent territory were ceded to Gwalior State and the capital of the district was moved to a new town, Jhansi Naoabad (Jhansi Refounded), a village without \\"cantonment\\" (military camp). Jhansi (the old city) became the capital of a \\"subah\\" (prov√≠nce) within the state of Gwalior, but in 1886 was returned to British rule in exchange for the Gwalior Fort and the cantonment of Morar nearby. As a result of this territorial swap the area came again under direct British control of British India and it was integrated into the United Provinces.

Sinking Heading to Eureka, California, with 90 passengers on the foggy morning of August 22, 1888, at about 10 am she collided with RMS Oceanic, a liner inbound from Hong Kong. The two ships saw each other, but as was later determined by a British Naval Court, City of Chester was caught by tidal current and carried into the path of the larger ship. An eyewitness aboard Oceanic said: \\"Into her we crashed with irrisistible force, cutting her just as though she was a cheese.\\" She sank in six minutes, and despite rescue efforts by those aboard Oceanic, sixteen passengers, including two children, and three crew members died. In terms of loss of life, this is the second most deadly wreck in the history of San Francisco Bay, after the sinking of the in 1901. Oceanic had Chinese crew and her steerage passengers were Chinese immigrants; anti-Chinese xenophobia was high in the US at the time and initially the Chinese were accused of letting City of Chesters passengers drown. When news of their efforts to save them came out, it helped to reduce the prejudice against the Chinese.

It stars Brittany Allen, Freddie Stroma, and Melanie Papalia as a group of friends who must defend themselves against an alien onslaught.  Plot  A panicked woman runs to a shop wanting to use the phone. After being denied entry, she enters a nearby phone booth, and is taken by a flash of light. April and her boyfriend Kyle leave to spend the weekend at her parents' cabin. However Kyle has invited his friends Seth, Melanie, and Seth's girlfriend Lex. Along the way, Seth sets off fireworks in the car and they are pulled over by Sheriff Murphy, who gives them a warning. They make it to the cabin and begin drinking and smoking marijuana bought from April's nearby family friend, Travis. Kyle proposes to April, which she rejects, angering him. Later they see something crash in the woods, and upon investigating find that it is an alien spacecraft, with footprints leading away from the crash site. Returning to the cabin, the group encounters and shoots one of the aliens. They attempt to drive to the nearest town for help but are cut off by a fallen tree. A spacecraft appears overhead and abducts Lex as the rest flee to Travis's house. April explains what has happened and Travis gives his theory: that the aliens and the U.S. government have had a treaty since the Roswell incident; the aliens abduct people while the government is left to clean up the mess. There is only one rule: no human must engage them. Since April has shot one of them, it is considered a breach of the treaty, and now the aliens are hunting for them. The kids run back to the cabin and board up the windows, while Travis stays behind to fight, only to get either abducted or killed. Seth mistakes Sheriff Murphy and Deputy Mitchell for aliens and they arrest him, then argue about the aliens. Sheriff Murphy reveals that he blames the aliens for his wife's disappearance. An alien appears and uses telepathy to force Murphy to shoot himself and Deputy Mitchell, but April arrives and saves Seth in the nick of time. Unfortunately he panics and runs into the forest, where he is abducted. The remainder of the group retreat to the cabin, Kyle locking April and Melanie in the basement for their own protection, before hiding in the bathroom with a knife planning to ambush the aliens. His plan fails when an alien jumps out and abducts him. April and Melanie sit in the basement and reminisce about April's parents taking them fishing. Melanie decides to end her own life rather than be abducted, taking an overdose of sleeping pills, and leaving April to face the aliens alone. April plans to fight them off with a crowbar but the aliens leave voluntarily. When April realizes they have taken Kyle she attracts their attention by setting off fireworks, causing the aliens to return and abduct her too. She awakens on the alien spaceship and starts to explore the dark hallways, finding corpses of humans and an alien-human hybrid. In another part of the ship, Seth wakes up stripped naked and strapped to an upright operating table, where he is branded and subjected to bizarre and ultimately fatal medical experiments. April finally finds Kyle and they embrace as the aliens discover them. Kyle and April awaken in a field, having been returned to earth. As they walk back home through the forest they come across U.S. Army soldiers at the UFO crash site, who shoot them. As they lie wounded, April gives Kyle the engagement ring, which he puts on her finger. The soldiers shoot them dead, before dumping the bodies in a pit and incinerating them, confirming there are no other surviving witnesses. The military's cleanup operation continues, confirming Travis's theory that the U.S. government is indeed hiding the existence of extraterrestrials.

Reception Critical reception for Extraterrestrial has been predominantly negative and IndieWire rated it at \\"C‚àí\\" and commented that it was \\"an example of how not to make a horror film\\". Fangoria and Bloody Disgusting both expressed disappointment over the film, as both felt that Extraterrestrial utilized too many familiar tropes and cliches of sci-fi horror movies. In contrast, Den of Geek gave the film a mostly positive review and commented that the movie had \\"clever visuals to occasionally distract from its mediocrity.\\" While Jack Bottomley of Starburst magazine also wrote a more positive, if slightly mixed, review saying, \\"Extraterrestrial is an untaxing albeit regularly clich√©d watch, but still a fun dose of sci-fi horror, even if the search for a truly great modern alien horror goes on\\".

It provides a wide range of algorithms for deep learning, and uses the scripting language LuaJIT, and an underlying C implementation. As of 2018, Torch is no longer in active development.Torch GitHub repository ReadMe However PyTorch, which is based on the Torch library, is actively developed as of June 2020.PyTorch GitHub repository  torch  The core package of Torch is \`torch\`. It provides a flexible N-dimensional array or Tensor, which supports basic routines for indexing, slicing, transposing, type-casting, resizing, sharing storage and cloning. This object is used by most other packages and thus forms the core object of the library. The Tensor also supports mathematical operations like \`max\`, \`min\`, \`sum\`, statistical distributions like uniform, normal and multinomial, and BLAS operations like dot product, matrix-vector multiplication, matrix-matrix multiplication, matrix-vector product and matrix product. The following exemplifies using torch via its REPL interpreter: > a = torch.randn(3,4) > =a -0.2381 -0.3401 -1.7844 -0.2615 0.1411 1.6249 0.1708 0.8299 -1.0434 2.2291 1.0525 0.8465 [torch.DoubleTensor of dimension 3x4] > a[1][2] -0.34010116549482 > a:narrow(1,1,2) -0.2381 -0.3401 -1.7844 -0.2615 0.1411 1.6249 0.1708 0.8299 [torch.DoubleTensor of dimension 2x4] > a:index(1, torch.LongTensor{1,2}) -0.2381 -0.3401 -1.7844 -0.2615 0.1411 1.6249 0.1708 0.8299 [torch.DoubleTensor of dimension 2x4] > a:min() -1.7844365427828 The \`torch\` package also simplifies object oriented programming and serialization by providing various convenience functions which are used throughout its packages. The \`torch.class(classname, parentclass)\` function can be used to create object factories (classes). When the constructor is called, torch initializes and sets a Lua table with the user- defined metatable, which makes the table an object. Objects created with the torch factory can also be serialized, as long as they do not contain references to objects that cannot be serialized, such as Lua coroutines, and Lua userdata. However, userdata can be serialized if it is wrapped by a table (or metatable) that provides \`read()\` and \`write()\` methods.  nn  The \`nn\` package is used for building neural networks. It is divided into modular objects that share a common \`Module\` interface. Modules have a \`forward()\` and \`backward()\` method that allow them to feedforward and backpropagate, respectively. Modules can be joined together using module composites, like \`Sequential\`, \`Parallel\` and \`Concat\` to create complex task-tailored graphs. Simpler modules like \`Linear\`, \`Tanh\` and \`Max\` make up the basic component modules. This modular interface provides first-order automatic gradient differentiation. What follows is an example use-case for building a multilayer perceptron using Modules: > mlp = nn.Sequential() > mlp:add( nn.Linear(10, 25) ) -- 10 input, 25 hidden units > mlp:add( nn.Tanh() ) -- some hyperbolic tangent transfer function > mlp:add( nn.Linear(25, 1) ) -- 1 output > =mlp:forward(torch.randn(10)) -0.1815 [torch.Tensor of dimension 1] Loss functions are implemented as sub-classes of \`Criterion\`, which has a similar interface to \`Module\`. It also has \`forward()\` and \`backward()\` methods for computing the loss and backpropagating gradients, respectively. Criteria are helpful to train neural network on classical tasks. Common criteria are the Mean Squared Error criterion implemented in \`MSECriterion\` and the cross- entropy criterion implemented in \`ClassNLLCriterion\`. What follows is an example of a Lua function that can be iteratively called to train an \`mlp\` Module on input Tensor \`x\`, target Tensor \`y\` with a scalar \`learningRate\`: function gradUpdate(mlp, x, y, learningRate) local criterion = nn.ClassNLLCriterion() pred = mlp:forward(x) local err = criterion:forward(pred, y); mlp:zeroGradParameters(); local t = criterion:backward(pred, y); mlp:backward(x, t); mlp:updateParameters(learningRate); end It also has \`StochasticGradient\` class for training a neural network using Stochastic gradient descent, although the \`optim\` package provides much more options in this respect, like momentum and weight decay regularization. Other packages Many packages other than the above official packages are used with Torch. These are listed in the torch cheatsheet. These extra packages provide a wide range of utilities such as parallelism, asynchronous input/output, image processing, and so on. They can be installed with LuaRocks, the Lua package manager which is also included with the Torch distribution. Applications Torch is used by the Facebook AI Research Group,KDnuggets Interview with Yann LeCun, Deep Learning Expert, Director of Facebook AI Lab IBM,Hacker News YandexYann Lecun's Facebook Page and the Idiap Research Institute.IDIAP Research Institute : Torch Torch has been extended for use on AndroidTorch-android GitHub repository and iOS.Torch-ios GitHub repository It has been used to build hardware implementations for data flows like those found in neural networks.NeuFlow: A Runtime Reconfigurable Dataflow Processor for Vision Facebook has released a set of extension modules as open source software.

The first edition of the game was published in 1999, with the most recent edition, Times' Up! Deluxe, published in 2008. It is a game for teams of two or more players, and is played in three rounds. Time's Up! is based on the classic parlour game known as Celebrity.  Gameplay  The game is played using a set of 40 randomly chosen name cards, known as the Deck of Fame. The Deck of Fame is used throughout all three rounds of the game. Each team gets 30 seconds to guess as many names as possible, with one player giving clues to his teammates. Players use words, sound effects and charades as they give their clues, but speech becomes more restricted as the game progresses in rounds 2 and 3. On each team's turn, one member of the team is the Cluegiver and the rest are the Guessers. * In round 1, the Cluegiver draws a name card and begins giving clues to his teammates (Guessers). Almost anything is allowed for cluegiving, but passing is not allowed. The Cluegiver can sing, hum, point, charade, give full descriptions of the person, etc. The round ends when all names have been guessed. * In round 2, the Cluegiver may give only one word for each clue, which may be repeated as often as desired. Once the word is said, only non-verbal clues (sound effects, charades) may be given. Teammates get one guess only, and passing is allowed. * In round 3, the Cluegiver may not use any words at all. Only sounds and charades may be used for each clue. Teammates get one guess only and passing is allowed. For advanced play, there is an optional round 4 in Time's Up!, where the Guesser starts with their eyes closed while the Cluegiver freezes in a pose depicting their clue. Once frozen, the Guesser opens their eyes and must give one guess. The Cluegiver looks at the next card and repeats the process.  Versions  Two expansions for Time's Up were published by R&R; Games in 2001 and 2002, adding new cards. In 2008, Time's Up Deluxe was published, which combined the best cards from the base game and those two expansions with a number of new cards. Also in 2008, Time's Up: Title Recall was published. This version of the game challenges players to guess the titles of books, films, songs, etc., using the same basic rules.  Reception  Time's Up has been named Best Party Game by the Chicago Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle, and Games magazine, and has won over 15 awards including the Mensa Select award.

Early life Born at Musquodoboit, Nova Scotia, on 6 March 1829, he was the eldest of five children of John Sprott, Presbyterian minister there, by his third wife, Jane Neilson. Both his parents came from Wigtownshire. After early education in the colony, Sprott entered Glasgow College in 1845, where one of his fellow students was Henry Campbell-Bannerman who consulted him about studying for the ministry. Sprott graduated with a BA in 1849. He had introductions to the families of Norman Macleod the younger, Andrew Kennedy Hutchison Boyd, and Laurence Lockhart, brother of John Gibson Lockhart. Years of travel His father approved of his son's decision to join the Church of Scotland, and, ordained in 1852 by the presbytery of Dunoon, Sprott returned to Nova Scotia, to act as assistant at St Matthew's, Halifax. There he served also as chaplain to the 72nd Highlanders, alter posted to the Crimea. After visits to Newfoundland and the United States, he returned to Scotland in 1856, and having served short periods as assistant minister at Greenock and Dumfries, he was gazetted to a chaplaincy to the Scottish troops at Kandy, and went out to Ceylon in 1857, where he was for seven years. In 1865 Sprott left Ceylon and acted for a time as chaplain to the Scottish troops at Portsmouth. Scottish minister Sprott was presented to the parish of Chapel of Garioch, Aberdeenshire, in 1866. He opposed the movement for the abolition of patronage in the Church of Scotland, and carried through the Synod of Aberdeen an overture to the General Assembly in favour of celebration of holy communion during its sittings. With the help of Thomas Leishman he procured a recommendation on the use of the Apostles' Creed in baptism. As moderator of the Synod in 1873, he preached at its April meeting a sermon on The Necessity of a Valid Ordination. After an unsuccessful application for the chair of church history in the University of Edinburgh Sprott, early in 1873, was presented to the parish of North Berwick. At the assembly of 1882 Sprott successfully joined Leishman in a protest against the admission of congregational ministers without Presbyterian ordination. In 1884 he saw the erection of a new parish church. In the summer of 1879 the assembly had sent him to visit the Presbyterian churches of Canada, and also appointed him to a lectureship in pastoral theology. He was disappointed in two further applications for professorships of church history ‚Äî at Glasgow in 1886 and at Aberdeen in 1889. Sprott joined on its formation, in 1886, the Aberdeen (later the Scottish) Ecclesiological Society, and in 1892 took a leading part in founding and conducting the Scottish Church Society, for orthodox doctrine; he was founder of the Church Law Society. An advocate of reunion after the disruption of 1843, he supported the efforts of Charles Wordsworth, and the Scottish Christian Unity Association founded by George Howard Wilkinson. Last years In 1902 Sprott celebrated his ministerial jubilee of 50 years, but with heart weakness he petitioned the presbytery next year for the appointment of an assistant and successor, and retired to Edinburgh. He died at Edinburgh of heart disease on 27 October 1909, and was buried at North Berwick. Works In Ceylon Sprott wrote a pamphlet on the Dutch Church there. Opposing what he was as a drift of Scottish church people towards episcopacy, he published The Worship, Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of Scotland, promoting ideas which resulted in the formation of the Church Service Society (1865). Returning to Scotland, he pursued liturgical and historical studies, and became influential on the editorial committee of the Church Service Society. In 1868 he published a critical edition of the Book of Common Order, commonly called \\"John Knox's Liturgy\\", and in 1871 his Scottish Liturgies of James VI. As lecturer in pastoral theology, Sprott spoke at the four Scottish universities, and published Worship and Offices of the Church of Scotland (1882). His lectures had earned the degree of D.D. from the University of Glasgow, conferred in 1880. Late in life, Sprott published: *His John Macleod Memorial Lecture, The Doctrine of Schism in the Church of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1902); *a new edition of John Knox's Liturgy (1901); *an edition (1905) of The Liturgy of Compromise used in the English Congregation at Frankfort, 1557, bound up with H.

The fifth episode of the Shell Presents presentations of standalone television dramas, it originally aired 11 July 1959 on Melbourne station GTV-9, a video-tape was made of the broadcast and shown on Sydney station ATN-7 on 25 July 1959 (this was prior to the formation of the Nine Network and Seven Network). It was the first hour of drama made for commercial Australian TV which was written and produced by an Australian with an all Australian cast. It was called \\"a gentle study of an ordinary life.\\" Shell Presents was a monthly series presenting locally produced television dramas and comedies. Most of these were adaptations of overseas dramas such as Johnny Belinda and One Bright Day, but a few were locally- written. Filmink magazine called this \\"one of those naturalistic slice of life dramas that they liked to do on TV in the late ‚Äò50s off the back of the success of Paddy Chayefsky‚Äôs TV writing.\\" Archival status of the program is unknown. Plot The last day at work of Hector Skeats, a costing clerk in a city office, who is retiring after many years. He is a father of two, a girl in her early twenties and a boy in his late teens. When his retirement is officially recognised by his boss, his son is arrested for stealing a car. Cast *Edward Howell as Horace Skeats *Elizabeth Wing as Mrs Skeats *Don Battye as his son *Roslyn De Winter as their daughter *Syd Conabere as Clarrie *Tony Brown *Dudley Burton *John Morgan *Frank Rich *Lloyd Cunningham Production The play was written by John Ford, a Sydney journalist. At the time of writing he worked in public relations at Qantas. It was the second original Australian episode of Shell Presents, following They Were Big, They Were Blue, They Were Beautiful. That play had come third in a Shell-sponsored competition for new Australian TV plays. Ford wrote The Big Day for this competition but was unable to submit it in time. However it was picked up for production. His writing style was compared with Paddy Chayefsky but Ford said, \\"I wasn't conscious of writing in any particular style when I started the play. All I have tried to do is portray a day in the life of an extremely ordinary little bloke, the kind of person who lives a dull existence from one week to the next.\\" It involved a cast of ten. Reception When the play screened, viewers called with their congratulations, jamming the switchboard for half an hour. The TV critic for The Age said Howell's casting \\"was the vital factor in making the drama the best yet presented in commercial series.\\" The TV critic for the Woman's Weekly called it \\"beautifully done, well acted and produced... an hour of very real and moving entertainment. All the Australians in it were just ordinary people, not the usual well-known theatrical Australian types but the kind of people you'd find any- where in the world.\\" The critic for the Sydney Morning Herald thought the play demonstrated \\"television 's ability to make dramatic entertainment of undramatic people and events... except for about 45 seconds of gross overstatement in the middle of the play, and a sentimental twist at the end which weakens its main argument\\" the main conflict was \\"cleverly conducted and neatly contrived\\". He thought Kinnear's \\"direction was generally efficient, and, in one or two scenes and the opening documentary titles, more imaginative than in some previous unlively live productions.\\" Valda Marshall of the same paper said the play was \\"exactly right for the living room atmosphere of TV viewing\\" and praised the direction and acting. Marshall liked the play so much that two years later she said it \\"has remained pretty much par for the course for Australian TV drama ever since\\". Ford later sold the play to Italian and British TV.

It originally aired on FX in the United States on April 23, 2014. Plot Elizabeth and Philip infiltrate the Contra training base posing as septic system employees. Elizabeth assassinates their intended targets, while Philip takes photos of the training exercises. He's forced to kill three American personnel who stumble upon him. The Jennings later find that the truck driver they kidnapped for information and left tied up in the forest has frozen to death. Philip is upset by the unnecessary deaths. The Jennings family attends a service at the church that runs Paige's youth program. They inadvertently learn that Paige has donated $600 of her savings to missionary activities. Neither of her parents approve of this gesture, especially Philip. Philip lashes out at Paige when they return home. Philip later meets Pastor Tim (Kelly AuCoin) and angrily asks him to stay away from his daughter. Pastor Tim responds by telling Philip he, too, can be saved before Philip walks out. Elizabeth awakens Paige in the middle of the night to do chores, telling her that being a grown up means having to do things even if you don't want to do them and not always getting what you want. Stan receives the code-word clearance for the \\"Have Blue program\\". Three stealth aircraft scientists meet with Stan, and reveal that scientists all work separately and both Northrop and Lockheed are competing for the DoD contract for stealth aircraft. They also tell Stan about the date and location of a key meeting of the defense contractors. Stan meets Gaad, who has been summoned to testify in front of the committee for the murder of Vlad. Gaad is packing up his office, believing he will be fired shortly after the testimony due to his involvement in the murder. He also learns that the key meeting occurred on the same day as the unsolved murders of a family (actually KGB sleepers Emmett and Leanne and their daughter) and begins exploring a possible link between the events. He searches through the evidence from the murders but does not find anything of interest. Gaad later meets Arkady and threatens that if he's forced to testify he'll reveal the information about hidden KGB agents to the press; Arkady listens politely but does not respond. Fred reveals to Philip that he and other stealth scientists have been summoned to a meeting by the FBI but doesn't know why; it turns out to be for Stan's investigation. Stan questions several attendees of the meeting, including Fred, who insists that he would \\"never betray his country\\". Stan seems skeptical. Stan later arrives home to learn his wife Sandra is considering an affair with a man she met in est. Stan asks if Sandra is leaving him, and she walks out. Philip plays a doctored tape to Martha to poison her relationship with Gaad, and tells her that someone in her office is leaking information about the stealth aircraft project. They start to get intimate, but Philip stops her saying he's drunk and upset. Meanwhile, Elizabeth attends an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting to befriend a Northrop employee and glean stealth technology information from her. Production The story for the episode was written by Oliver North and Tracey Scott Wilson, while Wilson wrote the teleplay. The episode was directed by Alik Sakharov.

The show is presented by Pauline Gillespie (Polly) and Grant Kereama. It was previously produced by Marc Peard, known as \\"New Hot Guy\\", and previously aired on ZM and The Hits. In 2007 the Morning Crew won the Best Metropolitan Music Breakfast Hosts award at the New Zealand Radio Awards. Show history Polly and Grant first teamed up together in the late eighties along with Nick Tansley presenting their show exclusively on ZMFM in Wellington this was at a time when ZM in Wellington was live and local 24 hours and day and not networked to any other region. Polly and Grant initially started out working different shifts before moving together to the breakfast show. The show has always been a top rating show in the Wellington market and Polly and Grant have won awards at the New Zealand Radio Awards. The Wellington-based breakfast show hosted by Polly, Nick and Grant was networked into Palmerston North in 1997 when ZM launched in Palmerston North. The Palmerston North show was the same as the Wellington show with live voice breaks mostly tailored to the Wellington audience. In 2000 Polly, Nick and Grant went off the air in Palmerston North when all shows on ZM in Palmerston North were replaced with Auckland-based shows. In 2001 the Wellington-based ZM breakfast show went nationwide, previously other regions had the Auckland-based morning show hosted by Marcus Lush this show did not rate that well so as a result the Wellington-based show became the nationwide breakfast show. Originally ZM ran their breakfast show between 6AM and 9AM for all regions and then after 9AM the ZM Morning Crew would continue their show exclusively for Wellington only with other regions starting the workday show at 9AM, ZM chose to do this so that one hour of the show could still be treated as a local show for the Wellington audience. At the start of 2004 ZM decided not to renew Nick's contract and the show was now presented by just Polly and Grant, Nick worked on the breakfast show on Wellington's ZM between 2005 and 2008. Later in 2004 ZM ran a competition to find an extra for their show who would be known as their apprentice. The winner was Cam Bisley who was known as the 19 Year old virgin from the Hawkes Bay. Cam lasted on the station until 2007. Since 2004 the show has been produced by Mark Peard who is known on air as New Hot Guy. In 2014 a decision was made to rebrand the Classic Hits network as The Hits with Polly and Grant to present the breakfast show to 20 markets, for most markets this meant the loss of a local breakfast but the addition of local programming between 9am and 3pm, some markets did retain their local breakfast. For markets that don't take Polly and Grants show listeners can opt to hear a highlights show between 6pm and 7pm. The show content is also available online. On August 12, 2015 Polly and Grant announced on air their decision to separate however they assured listeners they will continue to host the show together. They left The Hits in March 2017. Previous ZM Morning Shows While Polly and Grant have presented their show to the Wellington audience since the 1990s other region previously had their own local shows or a network show. =Si and Phil (Christchurch)= During the 1990s the ZM Morning Crew on 91ZM Christchurch was hosted by Simon Barnett and Phil Gifford. The show rated well in the Christchurch market and was networked into Dunedin when ZM launched in Dunedin as 96ZM in 1996. Si and Phil left ZM in April 1997 after being offered a large amount of money to work on local station 92 More FM at the same time More FM was started in Dunedin as 98 More FM and Si and Phils show was networked onto the station but shows on More FM in Dunedin during the daytime were local. Today Simon Barnett still presents the same show on More FM but his co-host is Gary McCormick. =Rik and Katrina (Christchurch)= Rik van Dyke and Katrina Smith were the hosts of the ZM Morning Crew on 91ZM Christchurch between 1997 and 2001 after Si and Phil left. Their show was also networked onto 96ZM Dunedin and 96ZM Invercargill. Previously Rik and Katrina had worked together as the morning hosts on Taranaki's Energy FM (now More FM). Rik and Katrina were originally joined by Chuckie Shearer in 1997 until the middle of 1998 when Chuckie left to go to Christchurch's Classic Hits 97.7. After Chuckie left the 91ZM Christchurch drive host Jason Royal joined the show for a year as the third member of the crew. However Jason made a return to the drive show in 1999. Rik and Katrina's show was axed at the start of 2001 when ZM made a decision to close their Christchurch studio and network the Wellington breakfast show into Christchurch with other shows being based from Auckland. Rik accepted a job hosting the breakfast show on Classic Hits 97.7 in Christchurch and Katrina was also offered this position but instead took a job with Fifeshire FM (now More FM) instead. Rik is now the programme director for The Breeze in Christchurch and Katrina is at The Breeze in Wellington. =Jaala and Sandy (Northland and Waikato)= Jaala Dyer and Sandy Antipas were the hosts of the ZM Morning Crew in Northland and Waikato during the late nineties. The show originated on Whangarei's 93ZM as a local breakfast show when ZM started in Northland, the show was moved to Hamilton and networked back to Whangarei in 1998 to 1999 with local 'out and about' content provided by Andrew Hepworth in Waikato and Dave Smart in Northland. Both shows were replaced with the Auckland-based breakfast show in 2000. =Marcus Lush= Marcus Lush was the host of the 91ZM Auckland breakfast show after ZM made a return to the Auckland region around 1996. The show was later networked to northern regions such as Rotorua and Hawkes Bay after ZM began expanding to these regions and in 2000 the show went nationwide replacing network shows in all regions except Wellington and Christchurch where these regions kept their local shows. The show rated poorly and as a result was axed at the start of 2001 when the Wellington Crew took place as the new nationwide breakfast show.

History Casa Aztl√°n. A mural in Pilsen, Chicago for the Chicano Movement The first Mexicans who came to Chicago, mostly entertainers and itinerants, came before the turn of the 20th Century.Kerr, Louise A. N. \\"The Mexicans in Chicago\\" (Archive). Northern Illinois University. Retrieved on April 24, 2014. In the mid to late 1910s Chicago had its first significant wave of Mexican immigrants. Originally the immigrants were mostly men working in semiskilled and unskilled jobs who originated from Texas and from Guanajuato, Jalisco, and Michoac√°n.Arredondo, Gabriela F. and Derek Vaillant. \\"Mexicans\\" (Archive). Encyclopedia of Chicago. Retrieved on April 24, 2014. After immigration was largely reduced in the 1920s, internal migration from the Southwestern United States became the primary driver of Mexican population growth in Chicago.Alvarez, p. 81. Circa the 1920s Mexicans were used as a buffer between Whites and Blacks. Ren√© Luis Alvarez, a professor at Northeastern Illinois University, stated that Whites perceived Mexicans to be apolitical and docile and treated the people originating from Mexico \\"with a kind of benign neglect and largely ignored their social needs or living conditions.\\" About 33% of the 20,000 persons of Mexican origin in Chicago were male family members of the single male workers, and/or women and children. By the end of the 1930s the Mexican population had declined to 14,000; this was due to repatriations to Mexico in the post-Great Depression; Louise A. N. Kerr of the Illinois Periodicals Online (IPO) of Northern Illinois University Libraries stated that officials \\"seem to have been\\" less harsh towards those of Mexican origins compared to officials in areas of the Southwest United States. Circa 1941 the Mexican population had risen to 16,000. During the 1940s braceros were brought to Chicago and became a part of the Mexican- American community. There were 35,000 people categorized as Spanish-speaking in Chicago by 1950, including Mexicans and Puerto Ricans. In 1960 there were 23,000 Chicagoans who were born in Mexico. In 1970 that number was 47,397, and that year, of all major U.S. cities, Chicago had the fourth-largest Spanish- speaking population; Mexicans made up the majority of Chicago's Hispanophones at that time. From 1960 to 1970 there was an 84% increase in the number of Chicagoans who had at least one parent born in Mexico.Alvarez, p. 84. In the late 1960s and early 1970s Mexican-origin people in Chicago increasingly became politically active.Alvarez, p. 83. Demographics From the 1990 U.S. Census to the 2000 U.S. Census, the percentage of Mexican Americans in all of Cook County, Illinois increased by 69%, and the percentage of Mexicans in the City of Chicago in particular increased by 50% in the same time period. As a result, Chicago's number of Mexicans surpassed the number in the cities of Houston and San Antonio, Texas. As of the 2000 U.S. Census there were 786,000 residents of full or partial Mexican origin in Cook County, giving it the largest ethnic Mexican population in the United States that is not in the Southwest and the third largest ethnic Mexican population of any county after Los Angeles County, California and Harris County, Texas. As of that year the number of ethnic Mexicans in Cook County is greater than that of each of the metropolitan areas of Acapulco, Cuernavaca, Chihuahua, and Veracruz. The total includes over 530,000 residents of the City of Chicago. () As of the 2010 Census, 961,963 residents of Cook County, including 578,100 residents of the City of Chicago, had full or partial Mexican origins. Geography Mexican neighborhoods include Pilsen in the Lower West Side and Little Village in South Lawndale. In the 1990s 40% of the Mexican origin population in Pilsen had migrated directly there from Mexico, and about 33% of the Mexican origin population in the Chicago area lived in Pilsen.Alvarez, p. 84. The Mexicans in the Near West Side settled south of Hull House along Halsted and patronized the St. Francis of Assisi church. Beginning in the 1930s the athletic team Saint Francis Wildcats, which had Mexican members, began meeting in the gymnasium of St. Francis of Assisi, and the members moved on to fight in World War II. The Hull House residents were displaced by the 1960s construction of the University of Illinois Chicago, and they moved to Pilsen and/or to suburban communities. In the post-1920s period the Mexicans in Back of the Yards mostly worked in meatpacking. In 1945 the first Mexican church opened there. Mexicans began moving into South Chicago in the post-1920s period, and there they stuck to defined neighborhoods and were a part of the working class. They joined area unions by the 1940s. Institutions National Museum of Mexican Art The National Museum of Mexican Art is located in Pilsen. Mexicans focused on improving their own neighborhoods and establishing their own organizations to do so after the 1920s. Fraternal organizations and mutual aid groups or mutualistas were established;Alvarez, p. 81. the latter promoted positive views of Mexicans,Alvarez, p. 82. financially assisted families facing deaths, unemployment, and/or illnesses, and promoted Mexican nationalism. By the middle of the 20th century newer organizations had been established. The Committee on Mexican American Interests promoted Mexican American student councils to encourage students to participate in higher education, promoted the G.I. Bill in the post-World War II period, and established a project with the Mexican Community Committee of South Chicago to gather potential recipients of scholarships and applicants to universities, and doing so by asking high school teachers working in Chicago neighborhoods with large numbers of Mexican-origin students to provide lists of names. Circa the middle of the 20th century the Mexican Community Committee of South Chicago and the Mexican Civic Committee of the West Side worked with LULAC to promote the value of getting an education among Mexican-American youth.Alvarez, p. 82-83. In general the newer organizations worked within existing power structures to promote education instead of trying to establish their own independent educational programs. Politics As of 2001, despite being the largest Hispanic and Latino ethnic group in Chicago, Mexicans have some, but less political representation than Chicago's Puerto Ricans. () Education Alvarez stated that establishment of the Benito Juarez Community Academy in Pilsen, \\"[i]n many ways\\", originated from the Chicano movement and its desire for greater recognition of Mexican-American history and identity.Alvarez, p. 80. During the opening ceremony, a bust sculpture of Ju√°rez and the flag of Mexico were presented, and the anthems of the United States and of Mexico were both played. The choice of the day of the ceremony was influenced by the fact that September 16 is the anniversary of the Cry of Dolores, the Mexican independence day, as well as near the beginning of the school year in Chicago.Alvarez, p. 78. Crime Circa the middle of the 20th century the Mexican Community Committee of South Chicago and the Mexican Civic Committee of the West Side stated that there had been an increase of juvenile delinquency complaints against persons of Mexican origin lodged in the Cook County Juvenile Court because children in the second generation allegedly were blocked from participating in the broader American culture while also losing the Mexican culture of the parents.

Established in 1921, it is the first public park in the city, built on the site that had been the location of successive regional governments since the Sui dynasty (581‚Äì618 AD). Due to its central location, it is colloquially called Central Park (). History =Imperial China= Zhang Zhidong, Viceroy of Liangguang, lived and worked in what is now People's Park. After Emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty reunited China in 589 AD, he reorganized the administrative divisions of China, and established the capital of Guangzhou Prefecture at Nanhai County, in modern central Guangzhou. The government of Guangzhou was then built at the site of People's Park. For over a millennium, People's Park had been the site of Guangzhou or Guangdong's regional government. At the end of the Ming dynasty, after most of northern China was conquered by the Manchu Qing dynasty, the Ming prince Zhu Yuyue proclaimed himself the Shaowu Emperor in Guangzhou, with his palace located at People's Park. After the Qing forces captured Guangzhou in 1647, Shaowu committed suicide and Guangdong became the domain of general Shang Kexi, titled King of Pingnan, who continued to have his palace at People's Park. After Shang Kexi's son Shang Zhixin participated in the failed Revolt of the Three Feudatories, the Qing court put him to death in 1680 and took direct control of Guangdong. People's Park became the office and residence of governors and viceroys. A series of officials, including Ruan Yuan and Zhang Zhidong, made improvements to the area. Ruan named its garden \\"Wanzhu\\" (ten thousand bamboos). During the Second Opium War (1856‚Äì60), the joint British and French force occupied Guangzhou for three years. Realizing they could not govern the city by themselves, they installed a puppet government headed by Bogui, an ethnic Mongol who had been the Qing acting governor of Guangdong. A grand inauguration ceremony was held in the park, which was considered a humiliating event by the defeated Chinese. =Republic of China= Sun Yat-sen and his son Sun Fo in 1911 After the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing, Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China, proposed converting the former site of the Qing provincial government to Guangzhou's first public park. The city government commissioned Yang Xizong (), a graduate of Cornell University, to design the park. On 12 October 1921, Guangzhou No. 1 Park was inaugurated by Mayor Sun Fo, the son of Sun Yat-sen. As Yang designed the park in a Western model, numerous ancient trees on the site were cut down to achieve the desired geometric symmetry. The original park was twice the size as today, with features such as fountains, sculptures, an assembly building, restaurants, and a shooting range, but largely devoid of trees. As the first public park of the city, it was immediately popular with the citizens. New trees have since been planted in the park. Due to its location at the center of the city, the park quickly became a main spot for rallies and major public events in Guangzhou. On 24 February 1924, Sun Sat-sen presided over a memorial service for Vladimir Lenin; on 8 March the same year, China's first major celebration of the International Women's Day was held in the park. The park also saw the great celebration of the victory of Kuomintang's Northern Expedition which was launched from Guangzhou, and the inauguration ceremonies of many government officials. The park was a popular site for festivals. From 11 February 1923, a narcissus festival was held in the park for five days. Between 1930 and 1949, five chrysanthemum festivals were held in the park. =People's Republic of China= After the Communist Party of China defeated the Kuomintang to establish the People's Republic of China in 1949, the park was renamed as People's Park. In 1999, the government demolished the wall that enclosed the park and various buildings attached to it, making the park completely open. The park has become a popular meeting place for local homosexuals. On 25 August 2009, after police crackdown on gay meeting places in Guangzhou, about 100 gay men publicly protested in the park in defense of gay rights. According to Human Rights Watch, the protest is hailed as a milestone in the history of LGBT rights in China. On 1 August 2010, during the Guangzhou Television Cantonese controversy, hundreds of people gathered in the park to protest the proposal to increase Mandarin programming at the expense of Cantonese. The government considered the demonstration illegal and arrested more than 20 people for \\"questioning\\". The government eventually backed down from the proposed restriction in Cantonese broadcasting. Statues The park features six groups of statues, including Fenghuo Niandai (Age of Warfare) by sculptor Li Hanyi (), depicting a female guerrilla fighter breastfeeding her baby. Another statue, of a nude woman shooting an arrow on horseback, commemorates Zhang Zhixin, a dissident executed during the Cultural Revolution for criticizing the idolization of Mao Zedong. Other statues commemorate the writer Lu Xun and the musician Xian Xinghai. Transportation Gongyuanqian Station underneath People's Park People's Park is served by Gongyuanqian Station (literally \\"park front\\"), a major transfer station on Line 1 and Line 2 of the Guangzhou Metro.

Early years: 1947‚Äì58 The party was founded on 7 April 1947 as the Arab Ba'ath Party by Michel Aflaq (a Christian), Salah al-Din al-Bitar (a Sunni Muslim) and the followers of Zaki al-Arsuzi (an Alawite). The founding congress, the 1st National Congress, was held in Rasheed Coffee Shop, close to what is now the Russian Cultural Centre. While Arsuzi's followers attended the congress, he himself did not. He never forgave Aflaq and Bitar of stealing the name \\"Ba'ath\\" from him. While the party remained small during the 1940s, the party together with some recruited Ba'athist military officers participated in the March 1949 coup which toppled President Shukri al-Quwatli. When Husni al-Za'im's rule proved just as repressive as that of Quwatli, the Ba'ath participated in another coup to overthrow the former. While al-Za'im's overthrow led to the reestablishment of democracy, the 1949 elections saw the People's Party (PP) win a majority. The PP sought the establishment of an Iraqi‚ÄìSyrian monarchical federal union, which Aflaq, strangely enough, supported. However, Akram al-Hawrani, the leader of the Arab Socialist Party, persuaded the Ba'ath Party leadership in supporting a coup led by Adib Shishakli. While Shishakli was dismissed at the beginning as being a follower of Hawrani, who was appointed Minister of Defense, but in 1952 Shishakli dismissed parliament and initiated a crackdown of the opposition. Aflaq, Bitar and Hawrani, after a short-lived government detention, left Syria for Lebanon. The most significant outcome of this was the merger of Hawrani's Arab Socialist Party with the Arab Ba'ath Party to form the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party. The merger had been discussed before Shishakli's crackdown of the opposition, but Aflaq had been reluctant. With the general amnesty of October 1953, the Ba'ath leaders returned. Hawrani, after his returned, immediately began planning a coup against Shishakli. In collaboration with the PP and the National Party (NP), and through his contacts in the military, Shishakli was forced to step down in February 1954. The Ba'ath Party became the major beneficiary of Shishakli's downfall, and in the 1954 elections, 90 percent of the Ba'ath Party members who stood for elections were elected to parliament, and it became the third largest party in the country. The 2nd National Congress convened in June 1954 elected a seven- man National Command (replacing the old Executive Committee), the party's highest organ between National Congresses. Aflaq, Bitar and Hawrani represented the Syrian Regional Branch while Abdullah Rimawi and Abdallah Na'was represented the Jordanese Regional Branch. The modern Ba'ath Party structure was created at the 2nd National Congress by amending the party's Internal Regulations. The Congress officially approved the merger of 1952 of the Arab Ba'ath and the Arab Socialist Party. The failure of the traditionalist parties (the PP and the NP) to close ranks, strengthened the public image of the Ba'ath Party. When Ba'athist Adnan al-Malki, the deputy chief of staff, was assassinated by Yunis Abd al-Rahim, a member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP), the Ba'ath Party launched a vehemently anti- SSNP hate-campaigns which \\"reached hysterical proportions\\". What followed organized anti-SSNP demonstrations, attacks on the SSNP's party organ al-Bina, the sentencing of its party leaders to jail, and the SSNP's dissolution. After this, the traditionalist parties with the Ba'ath Party and the Syrian Communist Party, signed a National Pact which sough the establishment of a unity government. After bickering with the tradionalist parties of the PP and the NP, a unity government was formed led by Sabri al-Asali. Bitar and Khalil Kallas were appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Economics respectively in the new government. The Ba'ath Party, in a position of strength, was then able to force the government to join a proposed federal union with Egypt. This would lead to the establishment of the United Arab Republic (UAR) and the dissolution of the Syrian Regional Branch. United Arab Republic period: 1958‚Äì61 On 24 June 1959, Fuad al-Rikabi, the 1st Regional Secretary of the Iraqi Regional Branch, called a press conference in Beirut, Lebanon in which he condemned the National Command, accusing them of not living up their official pan-Arab principles. According to Rikabi he spoke on the behalf of the Iraqi Regional Command. He further accused them of conspiring against the UAR. The National Command, Rikabi said, had taken over the Iraqi Regional Branch organization by illegal means, and had established a puppet Regional Command. This was confirmed by the National Command, which responded to criticism by stating that Rikabi had left his post as Regional Secretary on 29 November 1959, and that he was unqualified to speak on the party's behalf. The 3rd National Congress, held 27 August ‚Äì 1 September 1959, was attended by delegates from \\"Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, South Arabia, the Gulf, Arab South, Arab Maghreb, Palestine and Party student organisations in Arab and other universities outside the [Arab] homeland\\". The congress endorsed the dissolution of the Syrian Regional Branch, which had been decided by Aflaq and Bitar in 1958. The National Command expelled Rimawi from the Ba'ath Party in September 1959, because if his opportunism and his failure to appear in a National Command meeting which was investigation him on charges of financial irregularities. On 6 September 1959 Rimawi and Gharbiyah issued a resolution which declared the National Command resolution null and void, and denied the allegations which had been leveled against Rimawi. In May 1960, Rimawi had established a rival National Command, an organ which would develop into the Arab Socialist Revolutionary Ba'ath Party (ASBP), a pro-UAR party. The Revolutionary Ba'ath Party stopped its activity in either 1962 or 1963. By 1966, the Regional Branch had 1,000 members. On 2 February 1960 the National Command, in the presence of Rikabi, elected a Temporary Regional Command with Talib Hussein ash-Shabibi as Regional Secretary. Not long after, in July 1960, the 3rd Regional Congress of the Iraqi Regional Branch called on the national leadership to investigate Rikabi. The National Command investigated him in 1960, and expelled him from the party on 15 June 1961. Rikabi was later reported to be a member of the ASBP, and Radio Cairo continued to refer to him as the Regional Secretary of the Iraqi Regional Branch. The 4th National Congress, held in August 1960, reversed the decision reached at the 3rd National Congress, which supported the dissolution of the Syrian Regional Branch. It was mainly attended by representatives from the Lebanese Regional Branch. The congress had a strongly anti-Nasserite tendency, and the traditional leadership of Aflaq and Bitar was criticized. The delegates decided to deemphasize pan-Arabism for Marxian interpretation of socialism, and criticized the traditional leadership for entering Syria into the UAR. Discontent with Egyptian dominance of the UAR, led elements opposed to the union under Abd al-Karim al-Nahlawi, to seize power on 28 September 1961. Two days later, the Syrian Arab Republic was reestablished. Ba'ath rule and the 1966 split: 1961‚Äì66 Michel Aflaq (left) and Salah Jadid (right), shortly after taking power in 1963 The challenges of building a Ba'athist state led to considerable ideological discussion and internal struggle within the party. The Iraqi Regional Branch was increasingly dominated by Ali Salih al-Sadi, now a self-described Marxist, previously anti-communist as of the summer of 1963. He was supported in his ideological reorientation by Hammud al-Shufi, the Regional Secretary of the Syrian Regional Command, Yasin al-Hafiz, one of the party's few ideological theorists, and by certain members of the secret Military Committee. The far-left tendency gained control at the party's 6th National Congress of 1963, where hardliners from the dominant Syrian and Iraqi regional parties joined forces to impose a hard left line, calling for \\"socialist planning\\", \\"collective farms run by peasants\\", \\"workers' democratic control of the means of production\\", a party based on workers and peasants, and other demands reflecting a certain emulation of Soviet-style socialism. In a coded attack on Michel Aflaq, the congress also condemned \\"ideological notability\\", criticizing his middle-class background, within the party. Aflaq, angry at this transformation of his party, retained a nominal leadership role, but the National Command as a whole came under the control of the radicals. Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr (left), the Regional Secretary of the Iraqi Regional Branch, shaking hands with Michel Aflaq in 1968. In 1963 the Ba'ath Party seized power, from then on the Ba'ath functioned as the only officially recognized Syrian political party, but factionalism and splintering within the party led to a succession of governments and new constitutions. On 23 February 1966, a bloody coup d'√©tat led by a more left-wing, radical Ba'athist faction headed by Chief of Staff Salah Jadid, overthrew Aflaq and the Salah al-Din al- Bitar's Government. The coup sprung out of factional rivalry between Jadid's \\"regionalist\\" (qutri) camp of the Ba'ath Party, which promoted ambitions for a Greater Syria and the more traditionally pan-Arab, in power faction, called the \\"nationalist\\" (qawmi) faction. Jadid's supporters were seen as more radically left-wing then Aflaq and his peers. Many of Jadid's opponents managed to make their escape and fled to Beirut, Lebanon. Jadid moved the party in a more radical direction, although he and his supporters had not been supporters of the victorious far-left line at the Sixth Party Congress, they had now moved to adopt its positions. The moderate faction, formerly led by Aflaq and al-Bitar, were purged from the party. In the aftermath of the 1966 coup, the Ba'ath Party split in two; out of it a Damascus-based Ba'ath Party and a Baghdad-based Ba'ath Party were formed, with each maintaining that it was the genuine party and electing a separate National Command to take charge of the international Ba'ath movement. However, both in Iraq and Syria, the Regional Command became the real centre of party power, and the membership of the National Command became a largely honorary position, often the destination of figures being eased out of the leadership. A consequence of the split was that Zaki al-Arsuzi took Aflaq's place as the official father of ba'athist thought in the Damascus-based Ba'ath Party, while the Baghdad-based Ba'ath Party still considered Aflaq the de jure father of Ba'athist thought.

Mass amounts of fireworks, flares and smoke bombs were launched into the penalty box around Ajax goalkeeper Kenneth Vermeer in the early minutes of the match, which had been thrown onto the pitch by the Ajax hooligan firm VAK410 twice in the early build up of the game. After a 30 minute recess in which marketing director Edwin van der Sar addressed the crowd, Ajax would go on to lose the match 5‚Äì1 to Zwolle. Background On 20 April 2014, Easter Sunday the 2013‚Äì14 KNVB Cup final was played at De Kuip, the home stadium of Feyenoord, between Ajax and PEC Zwolle. Ajax had previously eliminated arch- rivals Feyenoord at home 3‚Äì1 in the Quarter-finals, and PEC Zwolle had advanced to the Cup final, having only been promoted from the Eerste Divisie the previous season. The match began with a long-distance 'cannonball' of a shot from Ricardo van Rhijn from long range which provided the one goal advantage for Ajax in the third minute of the game. Fireworks and flares Following the opening goal several fireworks, flares and smoke bombs were launched into the penalty box around Ajax keeper Kenneth Vermeer, from the Ajax supporters section behind the goal by members of VAK410, during PEC Zwolle's first attack on goal. The amount of fire and smoke on the pitch made the match impossible, while endangering the lives of the players on the pitch. Match referee Bas Nijhuis was forced to interrupt the match, taking a 30'-minute recess, with the players retreating to the changing rooms. Ajax marketing director Edwin van der Sar was furious with the crowd and took to the pitch to plea with the supporters to get them to stop. Ensuing match play The match resumed after the break with PEC Zwolle taking immediate control of the game and finding the equalizer only three minutes later. New Zealander Ryan Thomas goal in the eighth minute of the game was vital, as Thomas cut past Van Rhijn and surprised Ajax keeper Vermeer with a shot into the near corner. Ajax defender Niklas Moisander had made contact with the ball but it was not enough to prevent the equalizer. Mere minutes later Zwolle took the lead after Ryan Thomas scored from a rebound off the post in the twelfth minute, resulting from a free kick from Maikel van der Werff, making it 2‚Äì1 for De Blauwvingers. PEC Zwolle never let up pressure and increased the margin when Guyon Fernandez, who was on loan from Feyenoord, scored the third goal in the 22nd minute off an assist from Mateusz Klich and then moments later headed in his second goal into the far corner off a cross from Bram van Polen in the 34th minute. The two teams then headed into halftime with a scoreline of 4‚Äì1 in favour of Zwolle. Ajax manager Frank de Boer was visibly infuriated from the sidelines but there was little his team could do. While his club were at the top of the league table, one point away from winning their fourth consecutive (33rd overall) national title, winning the Cup would seem impossible considering the performance of his team in the first half, with the only chance coming from a shot by Bojan Krkiƒá which hit the crossbar. In the second half Zwolle team captain Bram van Polen scored the fifth and final goal for PEC, making it 5‚Äì1 after converting a successful corner kick from close range. PEC Zwolle had several more great opportunities to score, with missed chances by both Thomas and Fernandez. Ajax would lose to PEC Zwolle for the first time since 1988, with PEC Zwolle qualifying to compete in the 2014‚Äì15 UEFA Europa League, thus making their continental debut. PEC Zwolle had previously played in two other Dutch Cup finals, but secured their first against the Dutch champions, under manager Ron Jans. The club went on to make a boat tour in Zwolle to celebrate the following day on Easter Monday. Consequences Following the incident, 19 Ajax supporters were arrested as the fanatical core had caused mass destruction of the Stadion Feijenoord, breaking the chairs in the stands and writing graffiti everywhere, having even defaced the restrooms with faecal matter. The damage was reportedly estimated to be around ‚Ç¨60,000, which was then billed to the Amsterdam club. The supporters group F-side distanced themselves from the actions in disagreement, as VAK410 made repeated attempts to apologize for their actions from the firms own website. It was later revealed that the supporter groups had left in three busses from Amsterdam to Rotterdam, while the bus that was transporting the F-side was stopped and held at a rest stop for one and a half hours. VAK410 then tried to stall the match in protest of the police action. This was however never communicated between the supporters groups at the time of the incident. The Supportersvereniging Ajax released an official statement distancing themselves from the actions as well, calling it unacceptable behavior. Private investigator John van den Heuvel later revealed the involvement of the notorious criminal Martin P. alias Polletje in the fireworks incident in Rotterdam as one of the culprits. Polletje had been sentenced to life in prison in 2000 for his involvement in a quadruple murder case at the sex club Esther in Haarlem. After an appeal the sentence was reduced to 15 years, of which he served half the time based on good behavior. The police reportedly also have records showing that Polletje was blackmailing other members of the hardcore of Ajax to pay a percentage of the profits made from sold merchandise. Polletje himself had barely escaped an attempt on his life, in an attempted murder case in Badhoevedorp in 2012. Ajax revealed that they would not bring any supporters to away matches in Rotterdam when the team contest in De Klassieker for the following three years as a result of their actions. The KNVB (Royal Dutch Football Association) have not yet voiced their ruling over the incident, but immediately forbade 400 Ajax supporters from attending the Eredivisie away match against Heracles Almelo the following week as a result of their actions. The match in which Ajax could win the national championship. An additional 100-150 tickets to the match were subsequently cancelled as well.

The first kumbabishekam (renovative ablusion) was performed on 29 January 1982 and the second one was performed on 27 March 1994. The temple The temple is built as an exact replica of the original Ayyappan Temple at Sabarimala in Kerala. The temple was constructed in three floors presumably to lend the feeling of being atop a hill similar to the Sabarimala hill. The architecture follows the Kerala style and tradition with 18 steps to the main shrine and the sanctum sanctorum. The temple is known as Vada Sabari or North Sabarimala. Methods of worship is similar to the Sabarimala temple, whereby devotees observe all fasting, carry Irumudi (the sacred twin baggage) and sing bajans as they do for a pilgrimage to Sabarimala. There is a separate passage for other devotees coming to the temple without the Irumudi. The temple has all the features of Sabarimala with sub-shrines of Kannimoola Maha Ganapathy, Maaligaipurathu Amman, Nagaraja and other \\"Parivara Devatas\\". The single piece Dhvajasthamba or kodimaram (the flag post) of the temple is 40 feet tall. A meditation hall measuring 125 feet by 100 feet below the temple is where pilgrims are made to stay during the Mandala Pooja and the main festival. It is built of Jaipur tiles and is capable of accommodating 1,500 devotees. Music performances, religious discourses and other events are held in the hall during the festival and other important days. The temple has a golden and a silver chariots taken on procession during festival days. Worship The poojas (religious practices) in the temple are performed per the rules in Sabarimala, the difference being that the Sabarimala temple is open only on specific days in a year, while Rajah Annamalaipuram temple is open to devotees throughout the year. Festivals The festivals at the temple begin from Karthikai first day (in November) with Mandala Pujas and Brahmmotsavam.

Life Born into a clerical family at his father's manse on 7 May 1825, he was the eldest son, in a family of 13 children, of Matthew Leishman, D.D., minister of Govan, leader of the middle party in the secession controversy of 1843; his mother was Jane Elizabeth Boog, and a brother, William Leisham, became professor of midwifery at Glasgow. Educated first at Govan, he went to Glasgow High School and Glasgow University, graduating M.A. in 1843. After the usual course at the Divinity Hall, he was licensed as a probationer by the presbytery of Glasgow on 7 February 1847, and became assistant minister at Greenock. From 1852 to 1855 Leishman served the parish of Collace, near Perth, and from 1855 till 1895 that of Linton, Teviotdale, in the presbytery of Kelso. He was among the first to join the Church Service Society founded in 1865, reflecting his views on church matters, and in 1866 he became a member of its editorial committee, where he collaborated with George Washington Sprott. He proceeded D.D. from Glasgow University with a thesis on A Critical Account of the Various Theories of the Sacrament of Baptism (Edinburgh, 1871). In bad health, Leishman spent the winter of 1876-7 in Spain and Egypt, and investigated Mozarabic and Coptic service-books. In 1882 he joined Sprott and others in a formal protest against the admission by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland of two congregational ministers to the status of ordained ministers; the precedent was not acted on again. In 1892 he helped William Milligan to found the Scottish Church Society; he contributed papers to its conferences, and three times (1895-6, 1902-3, and 1905-6) acting as its president. He was moderator of the General Assembly of 1898, where Frederick Temple spoke for temperance; the speeches of both Temple and Leishman were published in a pamphlet. Leishman's third son, James Fleming, was ordained to succeed him at Linton (7 March 1895), and Leishman then moved to Edinburgh. There he died on 13 July 1904, and was buried at Linton. At Hoselaw, in a remote comer of the parish where Leishman used to conduct cottage services, a chapel was erected by public subscription to his memory in 1906. A. K. H. Boyd called him \\"the ideal country parson\\". Works In 1868 Sprott and Leishman published an annotated edition of The Book of Common Order, commonly called \\"Knox's Liturgy\\", and the Directory for the Public Worship of God agreed upon by the Assembly of Divines at Westminster, which became a standard authority. In 1875, he published a plea for the observance by the Church of Scotland of the five major Christian festivals, entitled: May the Kirk keep Pasche and Yule? \\"Why not\\", he answered in the words of John Knox, \\"where superstition is removed\\". To a work in four volumes, The Church of Scotland Past and Present, edited by Robert Herbert, Leishman contributed a section on \\"The Ritual of the Church of Scotland\\". He defined his ecclesiastical position in The Moulding of the Scottish Reformation (Lee lecture for 1897); 'The Church of Scotland as she was, and as she is' (John Macleod Memorial lecture for 1903); in an address on The Vocation of the Church at the Church of Scotland Congress, 1890, and in lectures on pastoral theology which were delivered by appointment of the general assembly at the four Scottish universities, 1895-7. He contributed to the Church Service Society's series of Scottish liturgies and orders of divine service, an edition with introduction and notes of the Westminster Directory (Edinburgh, 1901). Family Leishman married, on Lady Day 1857, his cousin, Christina Balmanno Fleming, who died on 15 June 1868. Five sons and two daughters survived him.

In contemporary times, Islamic extremism in Northern Nigeria is typified by the Boko Haram insurgency and the proselytizing campaigns of salafist groups like the Izala Society. History The first recorded Jihad in what is now Northern Nigeria was waged in the 14th century by the then Sultan of Kano Ali Yaji, it culminated in the Battle of Santolo and the subsequent transformation of the Habe-Hausa Kingdoms of Northern Nigeria into Islamic Sultanates. In the 19th Century, the Fula people led by Usman dan Fodio overthrew many of these Sultanates in another Jihad campaign and replaced them with the more puritanical Sokoto Caliphate. The slow rise of Islamic mysticism in the form of Sufi Brotherhoods under the Caliphate reversed some of the more puritanical tendencies of the early caliphate. After the pacification of Northern Nigeria by the British, they preserved most of the native institutions of the Sokoto Caliphate including its Emirates which were aligned with the Sufi Orders. In the 1960s, the former Grand Qadi of Northern Nigeria, Abubakar Gumi and Sheikh Ismaila Idris with support of wahabbist organisations from Saudi Arabia established the Jamatul Izalatul Bidia Wa Ikhamatul Sunnah. Infused with further religious zeal from Gumi, offshoots of Izalatul Bidi'a Wa Ikamatul Sunnah like Boko Haram and Ansaru developed. Izala Izala was the first Islamist organization in modern times to openly advocate for a militant transformation of Northern Nigerian institutions in line with fundamentalist interpretations of Islam. Officially founded in 1978 with funding from Saudi Arabia, it is split between the more Militant Ikhwanist-Qutbist view and the more political Maududist view. The Ikhwanists find inspiration from the teachings of the early Wahabist Ikhwan Movement and Sayyid Qutb, who justified the violent overthrow of systems deemed unIslamic. In 2001, a faction of the Ikhwanist broke away to form Boko Haram. The Maududist faction found inspiration from the teachings of the movements founder Abubakar Gumi and Abul A'la Maududi, and advocated for a 'smart' political jihad that they believe will mitigate any loss of life on their part.

When the boats no longer could reach the hall, it was demolished in 1787 and replaced with a neoclassicist building. From 1850 on, part of this was used to house the provincial government meetings, until it burned down in 1878. A replacement in neogothical style, intended to house the province and a postal office, was started in 1887 by architects Louis Delacenserie and Ren√© Buyck. The post office was opened in 1891, and the first part of the Provinciaal Hof in 1892. The last parts of the buildings were finished in 1920. The building was used as the government meeting hall until 1999, and is now mainly a ceremonial building, and also used for exhibitions. In 2012, the national government, which owns the building, was considering to sell it, but the provincial government, the main user of the Hof, protested.

Buffer over-reads can be triggered, as in the Heartbleed bug, by maliciously crafted inputs that are designed to exploit a lack of bounds checking to read parts of memory not intended to be accessible. They may also be caused by programming errors alone. Buffer over-reads can result in erratic program behavior, including memory access errors, incorrect results, a crash, or a breach of system security. Thus, they are the basis of many software vulnerabilities and can be maliciously exploited to access privileged information. Programming languages commonly associated with buffer over-reads include C and C++, which provide no built-in protection against using pointers to access data in any part of virtual memory, and which do not automatically check that reading data from a block of memory is safe; respective examples are attempting to read more elements than contained in an array, or failing to append a trailing terminator to a null-terminated string.

In the game Kanji is a high school student who becomes famous in television after fighting delinquents in the streets. Kanji becomes a victim of a series of kidnappings where the person is thrown to a dimension known as the TV World and the main cast of characters goes to save him from his alternate self, his Shadow. After Kanji is saved from the experience with the Shadow being turned into a power known as Persona, he joins the Investigation Team, befriending them in the process. He has also appeared in other works such as the fighting game Persona 4 Arena and the crossover Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth. He is voiced by Tomokazu Seki in Japanese, and Troy Baker in English in Persona 4, Persona 4 Golden, Persona 4: Arena, and the first twelve episodes of Persona 4: The Animation; his English voice actor for the remainder of Persona 4: The Animation, as well as all subsequent games, is Matthew Mercer. Kanji has received generally positive reception for his role in Persona 4 including his Social Links where he undergoes character development. However, his ambiguous sexual preference has become one of the game's most controversial themes with several writers commenting on whether the game does a good job in explaining Kanji's personality. Concept and creation Early designs for Kanji Early designs of Kanji were drastically different from the final one. He was initially given the classic gang-style pompadour. His design was made by Shigenori Soejima. Both of Kanji's Personas are based on his own visual appearance. Yu Namba, the Persona 4 Project Lead for Atlus USA, commented that while Kanji's Shadow might offend some players due to it being a gay stereotype, Kanji was nothing like a stereotype. Kanji's sexual orientation was left ambiguous to all players. Namba added \\"We would like everyone to play through the game and come up with their own answers to that question; there is no official answer ... What matters is that Kanji's other self cries out, 'Accept me for who I am!' I think it's a powerful message which many, if not all of us can relate to.\\" Nich Maragos, Persona 4 Editor for Atlus USA, agreed with Namba, but personally held the opinion that Kanji was homosexual. The localization team of Persona 4 made a point of keeping as true to the original translation as possible. He cited Shadow Kanji's flamboyant personality and stated, \\"That flamboyance was also what the viewers of the Midnight Channel wanted to see: a typical gay person on TV that people would laugh at. The TV station broadcasts what the audience prefers to watch -- it's a stark portrayal of modern society.\\" Namba also made some scenes which involved Kanji's sexual orientation more subtle without removing the scenes' value. He is voiced by Tomokazu Seki in Japanese, Troy Baker in English, and Matt Mercer in later English releases. Seki's portrayal was highly praised by the game's staff due to the delivery of his lines. Youichiro Omi was cast as Kanji Tatsumi for the Persona 4 musical. Appearances Kanji Tatsumi first appears in the PlayStation 2 video game Persona 4. He is a delinquent who has a reputation as being a bully, and is the center of numerous rumors regarding a confrontation with a local biker gang. As a result, he was initially given the \\"classic gang-style pompadour\\" in the making of his design. The fourth victim to be sent to the TV world, Kanji is revealed to have a complex with his Shadow revealing he hates girls as a result of criticizing his sewing and is more interested in boys. After the protagonist's group comes to save Kanji when he is trapped in the Midnight Channel, he accepts that his other self is an important part of his identity. Kanji learns of the Investigation Team's actions in Persona 4 and joins them to find the culprit. His sexual orientation remains ambiguous across the series, with Kanji being first interested in Naoto Shirogane when first meeting her, believing her to be a boy, but is still attracted to her when it is revealed that she is a girl. His Persona is , an imposing, black, robotic humanoid which has a skeleton-like design, like Kanji's shirt, and is armed with a large lightning bolt. Throughout Yu's interactions with Kanji, he reveals to be skilled at tailoring inspired by his family who runs a textile shop but stopped making dolls when accused by fellow students. Kanji eventually learns to take pride in his skills, rather than hide them. Shortly afterwards, Take-Mikazuchi evolves into , who has a fiery motif instead of Take-Mikazuchi's skeleton and lightning. In Persona 4: Golden, Kanji's new Persona is , which resembles Rokuten Maoh but has elaborate white armor with red flame details. The friendship made with Kanji serves as the Social Link to The Emperor; this is signified in Persona 4: The Animation by Yu's Persona . He appears as a playable character in Persona 4 Arena and its sequel Persona 4 Arena Ultimax with Take-Mikazuchi. In the game's story mode, Kanji accidentally falls into the TV World's P-1 Grand Prix tournament and believes he is having a dream as he encounters his friends. He later believes that the main cause of this is his Shadow who has been impersonated by an unknown person. He also appears in the spin-off games Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth and Persona 4: Dancing All Night. He is also available as a paid DLC character in BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle, which features characters from the Persona 4 Arena, BlazBlue, Under Night In-Birth, and RWBY franchises. Reception Kanji has received generally positive reception for his role in Persona 4. According to Gamasutra's Samantha Xu, reception for Kanji by Persona 4 players has been \\"neutral or positive.\\" Kotaku's Kirk Hamilton found Kanji to be a particularly funny character in Persona 4 Golden. He cited Kanji's animal crackers and \\"general grump obliviousness.\\" GamesRadar staff claimed that Kanji, as well as Chie and Teddie, were \\"well-defined by scenes that shift between comedy and drama fluidly.\\" Game Informers Kimberley Wallace felt that Kanji had one of the best Social Links in Persona 4. She stated, \\"From Kanji‚Äôs hilarious overreactions to seeing him show his true emotions about his struggle, the social link is fun and heartwarming.\\" He was also listed as the third best Persona character by Kimberley Wallace from Game Informer who praised the way he starts expressing he likes \\"adorable things\\" despite looking like delinquent. IGN listed him as the best Persona character, commenting that while initially looking like the \\"resident tough guy\\" of Persona 4, \\"he represents everything excellent about Persona's outstanding characters and storytelling.\\" Atlus senior project manager Masaru Nanba remarked on how popular the interpretation of Kanji and his Shadow were in the west in an interview with Famitsu in 2013. =Sexuality= While acting as a gay stereotype, Kanji's Shadow reveals his gender insecurities. This was one of the most discussed themes between writers. Kanji's sexuality is one of the most controversial elements of Persona 4 for North American players according to 1UP.com's Andrew Fitch. Fitch worried that both gay and straight players in North America may be offended by how he was designed. Atlus senior project manager Masaru Nanba remarked on how popular the interpretation of Kanji and his Shadow were in the west in an interview with Famitsu in 2013. CVG Online's Matthew Pellett called the examination of his sexuality a \\"first\\" for Japanese role-playing games. Game Career Guide's Patrick Hayes stated that Shadow Kanji represents his \\"confusion over manhood and sexuality.\\" Larry Hester of Complex ranked him the sixth best LGBT character in video games. IGN's Keza MacDonald cited Kanji as one of the few playable gay characters in a Japanese video game. Kotaku's Jason Schreier suggested that his lack of understanding of his sexuality comes from his young age. Colette Bennett, editor for Destructoid, felt that most American gamers would think Kanji was gay. She also felt that American designers were not \\"comfortable with portraying characters like Kanji.\\" VG247's Julie Horup listed Kanji as an example of a homosexual character in video games. Huffington Post also featured it in a list of LGBT video game characters. Salon's Luke Winkie chose Kanji as his favourite LGBT character in video games. He stated, \\"By the end of the game you remember Kanji as your friend, not a kid in the closet.\\" Gamasutra's Xu noted that Kanji was one of the first video game characters to address his sexual identity in an \\"engaging and meaningful manner.\\" She followed by stating that while he \\"may not be politically progressive enough to dub him the Harvey Milk of gaming ... his unique existence in Persona 4 is a small and positive move forward toward a more socially diversified gaming universe.\\" Brenda Brathwaite, author of \\"Sex in Video Games\\" stated: \\"It would have been amazing if they would have made a concrete statement that he is gay. That we could play as a gay main character in a video game would be a big deal.\\" She added, \\"I can find twenty things that I didn't like about how Kanji was portrayed, such as the game's juvenile nature in dealing with his sexuality, but there is a part of me that is thrilled there is a gay character in a game and that a game would portray how they are dealing with their inner struggles and interactions with friends.\\" Dr. Antonia Levi, author of \\"Samurai from Outer Space: Understanding Japanese Animation\\", discussed the differences between homosexuality's acceptability in the United States versus Japan. She claimed that unlike the US, Japan had no legislation related to homosexuality and did not view sexuality as a matter of \\"right or wrong.\\" She explained that this was the reason for Kanji's sexual ambiguity. Xu cited Levi in her article to explain that Japanese people tend to be outwardly traditional, and their private sexual life is not judged. She stated, \\"For Kanji, working at his family's textile shop was a very traditional and respectable job, one that could have been at risk had he made a lifestyle choice to have an openly gay relationship with another man.\\" She further cited Japan scholar Dr. Mark McLelland, who stated that \\"recent research has shown, the notion of 'coming out' is seen as undesirable by many Japanese gay men and lesbians as it necessarily involves adopting a confrontational stance against mainstream lifestyles and values, which many still wish to endorse.\\" Xu explains that this culture may explain that Kanji was not rejecting the existence of his homosexuality or that the developers were not homophobic. GameSpot's Carolyn Petit felt that his depiction \\"leaves a great deal to be desired\\" and stated that it \\"rejects\\" Kanji's sexuality instead of \\"embracing\\" it. She stated that she was intrigued by the idea behind Kanji initially, but was disappointed that Kanji's \\"shadow self\\" was based on his fear of women rather than his attraction to men.

Martyred in 831, he is a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, celebrated on 26 December.  Life  Euthymius was born in 751 or 754 in Ouzara, probably in Lycaonia in central Asia Minor. At an early age he entered a monastery, and sometime between 784 and 787, he was ordained as metropolitan bishop of Sardis by Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople. In this capacity he took part in the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, where he played a leading role in the council's decision to condemn Byzantine Iconoclasm. Euthymius spoke in several of the council's sessions, advocating the reinstatement of the exiled bishops Theodore of Amorium and Basil of Ancyra, the reinstatement of traditional veneration of icons as proposed by Tarasios and Pope Hadrian I, and the anathematizing of Iconoclasm and its supporters. According to his hagiography, sometime between 787 and 790 he participated in an embassy to the Abbasid court at Baghdad, where he distinguished himself by his ability and succeeded in securing a peace settlement with the Caliphate, but such a mission, let alone a peace treaty, is nowhere else attested for this period. Under Emperor Nikephoros I (r. 802‚Äì811) he fell into disfavour and was deposed and exiled to the island of Pantelleria off Sicily (ca. 804). According to his hagiography, Nikephoros' animosity was due to Euthymius persuading a woman, whom the future emperor had desired, to become a nun, but the real motive was probably Euthymius' support for the rebellion of the general Bardanes Tourkos in 803. Thanks to the intervention of Patriarch Tarasios, he was recalled from exile soon after, but was not reinstated in his old see. When Iconoclasm was once more adopted as the official doctrine under emperors Leo V the Armenian (r. 813‚Äì820) and Michael II the Amorian (r. 820‚Äì829), Euthymius again defended the veneration of icons, for which he was arrested, whipped and exiled, then released only to be again arrested and exiled. He was particularly vehemently persecuted by the future patriarch John Grammatikos. The traditional chronology of his death, found both in Byzantine chroniclers (Genesios, John Skylitzes and Theophanes Continuatus) and older historiography and martyrology (cf. the entries in the Catholic Encyclopedia), is 26 December 824, when he was whipped to death at the orders of Michael II. Modern research, however, places it on 26 December 831 on the island of St. Andrew to the north of Cape Akritas on the Bithynian coast south of Constantinople, during the reign of Michael II's successor Theophilos (r. 829‚Äì842). Euthymius' hagiography was written by Patriarch Methodios I of Constantinople. In addition, several letters by Theodore of Stoudios to Euthymius survive, as well as a panegyric poem in his honour, written by a certain Metrophanes.

For around 40 years it held the record for the tallest building in the skyline. The skyscraper was commissioned by the Bay Cities Guaranty and Loan Association to the Californian architects Albert R. Walker (1881‚Äì1958) and Percy Augustin Eisen (1885‚Äì1946), whose firm, Walker & Eisen, with a staff of more than 50 draughtsmen, was the most important leading practice in California in the 1920s. Among its many completed projects, the firm had recently designed the extraordinary skyscraper in the Romanesque Revival style known as the Fine Arts Building in Los Angeles (now owned by Sorgente Group of America), one of the most representative buildings in the city. The Clock Tower Building, not far from the beaches washed by the ocean and with an unobstructed view of the nearby mountains, occupies a rectangular lot located at 225 Santa Monica Boulevard, in the heart of the city‚Äôs business district and close to the main thoroughfare Third Street Promenade. The ground floor of the skyscraper, in the form of a compact parallelepipedal block surmounted by a tower, is occupied by retail spaces, and the upper stories by offices. The seemingly monolithic image of the building is actually enlivened by slight volumetric shifts that divide the high-rise into three sections: a wide basement level characterized by the large entrances to the retail areas; a robust second block, slightly tapered towards the top, that houses offices from the second floor to the twelfth, and lastly a square stepped tower which, placed off- centre with respect to the base, rises skywards and has clock-faces on each side ‚Äì hence the name Clock Tower. The skyscraper, with a load-bearing structure in reinforced concrete and steel, is faced with slabs of limpid, pure white stone that both absorbs and reflects the bright light and the clear Californian sky. The large masses and wall decorations of the skyscraper are reminiscent of pre-Columbian architecture, the pure geometries of the stepped temples and the pureness of form found in Mayan and Inca building. The twelve office floors are crowned by a crenellated border, where the most ornate decorations on the cladding are concentrated. The tapered, stepped tower on the top is also faced with white marble slabs, which form a zigzag pattern in relief on the sides and around the edge of the summit; it is visible from everywhere in the city and rendered instantly recognizable due to its rectangular clock with four black dials (one on each side of the tower), and whose shining hands mark the exact time and are an urban signal in the city. Due to its height, its imposing volumes and the immediate recognizability of its architecture, the Clock Tower Building has possessed a powerful urban identity since it was built. This makes it a true landmark that acts as a compass and guide in the boundless Santa Monica cityscape.

It was designated on 15 January 1985 by the consolidation of the World War II 1st Troop Carrier Squadron, which was inactivated on 18 December 1945 at Fort Lawton, Washington; the 1st Strategic Support Squadron, which was inactivated on 15 January 1959 at Biggs Air Force Base, Texas, and the 1st Air Transport Squadron, which was inactivated on 20 June 1971 at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. The 1st TCS was a transport squadron which served primarily in the China-Burma-India Theater. It participated in the airborne invasion of Myitkyina, Burma and other combat cargo operations in both Burma and China. The 1st SSS was a Strategic Air Command transport squadron providing a limited air transport capability to supplement that of the Military Air Transport Service (MATS). The 1st ATS was a Headquarters Command VIP transport squadron that replaced the 1001st Air Transport Squadron at Andrews Air Force Base. History =Origins= Prior to the early 1930s, transport aircraft in the Air Corps had been assigned to air depots and to service squadrons, although provisional transport squadrons had been formed for special projects. By 1932 Major Hugh J. Kerr, Chief of the Field Service Section of the Materiel Division, proposed the formation of a transport squadron at each air depot to act as a cadre for the transport wing the Air Corps proposed to support a field army in the event of mobilization. Major General Benjamin Foulois approved the formation of four provisional squadrons in November 1932.Maurer, Aviation in the U.S. Army, pp. 367-368 On 1 October 1933 the 1st Provisional Transport Squadron was constituted. However, there were no funds to man or equip the unit, which remained inactive. It was authorized to partially activate in 1935 at the Fairfield Air Depot, Dayton, Ohio in March 1935. The squadron was given a permanent designation as the 1st Transport Squadron in June and fully activated on 15 July 1935 with Bellanca C-27 Airbus aircraft assigned.Clay, Goff, With enlisted men as pilots, the squadron hauled engines, parts, and other equipment to airfields in their assigned depot area, returned items to the depot, and transferred materiel between depots. They also furnished transportation for maneuvers. The rapid transport of supplies by the squadrons permitted the Air Corps to maintain low levels of materiel at its airfields, relying on replenishment from depot stocks only when needed. In May 1937, the squadron was reassigned from the Fairfield Air Depot to the newly activated 10th Transport Group, which assumed command of all four squadrons. The squadron received two-engine Douglas C-33s, the military version of the DC-2 in 1936 and Douglas C-39s (DC-2s with tail surfaces of the DC-3) in 1939 to replace the single engine Bellancas. These, and various other militarized DC-3s remained as the squadron's equipment until the entry of the United States into World War II.Maurer, Combat Units, =World War II= After the Pearl Harbor Attack and the entry into World War II, in April 1942, its parent 10th TG was reassigned to the Air Transport Command (later I Troop Carrier Command) (I TCC). The 1st, now redesignated as the 1st Troop Carrier Squadron became an Operational Training Unit and converted to Douglas C-47 Skytrain transports. It moved to General Billy Mitchell Field, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and it joined the 5th Troop Carrier Squadron carrying out operations and transition training for pilots. In September the 10th transferred to Pope Field, North Carolina, where it continued to be a training squadron for I TCC. In February 1943, the group's 1st and 2d Troop Carrier Squadrons deployed to the CBI Theater and were assigned to Tenth Air Force. Upon the squadron's arrival in India, it was assigned to Tenth Air Force Headquarters. Upon its arrival with C-47s, it was decided that the squadron was to be attached to the Air Transport Command units in the Assam Valley of eastern India, to aid in moving supplies to China. The squadron was assigned to Chabua Airfield, and consisted of 13 C-47s, 42 officers and 62 enlisted men. After about a month, the squadron headquarters moved back to New Delhi, and flights of C-47s were sent to several airfields in the Assam Valley to supplement the ATC aircraft flying over \\"The Hump\\" into airfields in China. As more and more ATC aircraft arrived for the logistics mission to China, the squadron reformed at Sookerating Airfield in the Assam Valley in March 1943.U.S. Army Air Forces Historical Study No. 117; The Tenth Air Force, 1943; AAF Historical Office, Headquarters, Army Air Forces, July, 1946 With the squadron's return to Tenth Air Force control, it began combat operations, primarily supporting American and British forces in Burma. The squadron was active carrying commandos who would parachute at low altitude behind enemy lines, and perform their mission. Frequently, the squadron would locate small groups of men in camouflaged areas and drop resupply containers out of the door of the aircraft, usually flying at low level with the aircraft vulnerable to enemy ground weapons fire. In late April 1944 the squadron supported the Allied attack on Myitkyina Airfield in northern Burma. The squadron flew paratroopers and also towed in CG-4A Waco gliders to the airfield during the battle; later moving in combat engineers and equipment to prepare the captured airfield to land reinforcements.Merrill's Marauders After the battle ended the squadron continued its combat operations, transporting Allied troops, evacuating wounded personnel, and hauling supplies and material, including gasoline, oil, signal and engineering equipment, medicine rations, and ammunition. The squadron's missions were concerned primarily with support for Allied forces that were driving southward through Burma, but the 1st also made flights to China.Craven & Cate, The Army Air Forces in World War II, Vol. 5, The Pacific: Matterhorn to Nagasaki June 1944 to August 1945 The squadron was reassigned to Fourteenth Air Force in January and moved to China in August 1945, and received a Distinguished Unit Citation for transporting a Chinese army of more than 30,000 men from Chihkiang to Nanking in September 1945. The squadron returned to the US in December and inactivated on 18 December 1945. =Strategic Air Command= The 1st Air Transport Unit was organized at Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico, in July 1946 as part of a reorganization of the 58th Bombardment Wing. Due to its classified nature and mission during World War II, the 509th Composite Group was set up as an independent unit with its own airlift squadron.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 393 With its assignment to Strategic Air Command (SAC) in March 1946, it was decided to convert the 509th into a bombardment group. The 1st Air Transport Unit assumed the mission of the 509th's 320th Troop Carrier Squadron, which was inactivated.The 1st Air Transport Unit also inherited the nickname \\"Green Hornets\\" from the 320th. This nickname derived from the green tail stripe used by the 320th as a unit marking during Operation Crossroads, the atomic bomb tests performed in 1946. \\"Green Hornets Famous World Over.\\" The 509th was redesignated as the 509th Bombardment Group, Very Heavy. The new transport unit was assigned directly to the 58th Bombardment Wing, the parent organization of the 509th, although operational control was retained by SAC headquarters.Haulman, Daniel L., Lineage and Honors History, 1st Strategic Support Squadron, Air Force Historical Research Agency, 23 April 2014 The 1st continued the logistics support and special air transport mission of the inactivated 320th. In November 1946 the 58th Bomb Wing was assigned to Eighth Air Force and the 1st was also assigned directly to headquarters, Eighth Air Force. Little less than a year later, the unit moved to Fort Worth Army Air Field, headquarters of Eighth Air Force. As SAC and the Air Force began to expand, the unit supported SAC units in exercises and unit moves and deployment. As the only unit of its kind, it was called on for support in nearly all of these operations, including operations in Germany, Puerto Rico, Panama, Japan and Alaska. On 1 June 1948 it became the 1st Strategic Support Unit and moved to Biggs Air Force Base.1st Strategic Support Squadron History In early 1949 the unit participated in Operation Scordo, In this operation the unit transported support personnel and equipment to the four bases in Hawaii, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, and the Azores, that were used by the Boeing KB-29 tankers that supported the first non-stop flight around the world by the Boeing B-50 Superfortress \\"Lucky Lady II\\". For this operation the unit received a commendation from the Secretary of the Air Force. It provided similar support for the first deployment of jet fighters from the United States across the Atlantic to Germany. During 1949, as the mission load grew, the 1st became the 1st Strategic Support Squadron and provided the cadre for the new 2d Strategic Support Squadron. As the 2d was organized, the 1st transferred its Douglas C-54 Skymasters to the new squadron and began to re-equip with Boeing C-97 Stratofreighters. Eventually, a total of four strategic support squadrons, assigned directly to the SAC numbered air forces were organized around the United States. The wartime mission of the squadron was based on the requirement for SAC‚Äôs medium bombers to deploy to overseas bases to successfully reach their targets. Even with air refueling, some bombers would only reach a recovery base rather than its original launch base. SAC planned to use the squadron to transport personnel and equipment to recovery bases to perform maintenance and recovery operations. The attitude that SAC could not rely on other sources for this support was partly based in General Curtis LeMay‚Äôs experience during World War II when he had to rely on theater commanders for supply and found that theater supply channels could not keep up with the pace of strategic bombing operations. This convinced him that SAC needed total control of all aspects of a nuclear campaign.Deaile, p. 165 During the postwar years and through the 1950s the squadron carried much classified equipment and personnel to various locations around the world. It was upgraded first to C-97 Stratofreighters in 1949 operating 12 of that type. In 1951 C-124 Globemaster IIs replaced the C-97s, the first C-124A arriving at Biggs on 18 January 1951. It was inactivated on 15 January 1959 when SAC got out of the transport business and the 97th Bomb Wing was transferred from Biggs to Blytheville Air Force Base, Arkansas. =Consolidation= On 15 January 1985, the Air Force Historical Research Agency consolidated these three units, and designated it as the 971st Airborne Warning and Control Squadron. The 971st was never activated and remains in an inactive status.

The first was the 1st Airlift Squadron. The second was a Major Command Controlled (MAJCON) unit organized by Military Air Transport Service (MATS) that was designated and organized on 1 June 1948 at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii. It was redesignated 1263d Air Transport Squadron on 1 October 1948, when the Air Force required all MAJCON units be numbered with four digits in blocks of numbers assigned to each major command.

Ghastly Goals is the fifth direct-to-DVD special produced by Warner Bros. Animation, based upon the Scooby-Doo Saturday morning cartoons. It was available May 13, 2014, only through Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Field of Screams DVD. Plot Scooby and the gang are in Rio, Brazil enjoying a parade celebrating the beginning of the International Soccer Cup (a parody of the FIFA World Cup). Shaggy and Scooby leave the parade to get some more food and Scooby helps some kids find an errant, flying soccer ball. Scooby searches a nearby alley and finds the ball but not before he's chased away by a red, horned monster. The monster chases Scooby, and soon afterward Shaggy, out onto the parade route. After running off the spectators and smashing into floats, Scooby knocks it down with the soccer ball from the alley and he and Shaggy rejoin Velma, Fred, and Daphne. The group tries to subdue the monster but it disappears in a cloud of smoke. The police cordone the area and the kids who lost their soccer ball catch up to Shaggy and Scooby to ask for their autographed missing ball. Velma identifies the monster as a trickster called 'Eshu'. Fred promises the kids they will find the autographed ball and the gang ask Julio Luna, the director of the games, for help. He tells them all the spilled soccer balls on the parade route were taken back to the stadium, including the kids' ball that was mixed in with them. Sneaking into the stadium, the gang manages to find the equipment room where all the soccer balls are stored. Eshu is also there and chases after Shaggy and Scooby before a security guard arrives and sounds the alarm. Once again, the monster disappears in a cloud of dust and after a hasty retreat, Fred determines the Eshu is looking for the same autographed ball. The next day, they go to the alley where Scooby first encountered Eshu. Daphne finds a broken test tube that's labelled as belonging to Professor Eduardo Perez. When they go to the professor's research lab, they're stopped by an angry security guard but another scientist overhears what they found and brings them to the eccentric Professor Perez. They learn that the test tube was filled with an experimental liquid that modifies the quality of rubber (making it extra strong and bouncy) and it was stolen by Eshu the previous day. The gang figures that Eshu accidentally spilled the experimental liquid onto the kids' soccer ball in the alley and wants to find the ball to extract the formula and sell it. They sneak back into the stadium and realize the autographed ball has been taken out onto the field. They manage to make it onto the pitch but the autographed ball is being taken out to play. Scooby quickly dons a jersey and joins the Brazilian team. Scooby intercepts the super strong, super bouncy ball and manages to score a winning goal for Brazil in the final seconds of the match. Suddenly Eshu appears but after a few too many kicks, the supercharged ball gains momentum and crashes into the monster, sending it straight through the net and trapping it. Eshu is unmasked to be Reynaldo, the angry security guard from the research lab. The security guard reveals he has always wanted to be a magician and wanted the money from the serum sale to fund his magician dreams. He used trickery and a little smoke to \\"disappear\\". The security guard is taken away and the gang makes sure that the autographed ball is returned to its rightful owner after they remove the serum on it. For saving the tournament, the gang is rewarded with pizzas on a stick and Scooby manages to expertly deflect an errant soccer ball before the end.

Software taggants use standard PKI techniques (see Public key infrastructure) and were introduced by the Industry Connections Security Group of IEEE in an attempt to control proliferation of malware obfuscated via executable compression (runtime packer). The concept of a PKI-based system to mitigate runtime packer abuse was introduced in 2010 and described in a Black Hat Briefings presentation by Mark Kennedy and Igor Muttik. The term was proposed by Arun Lakhotia (due to its similarities with chemical taggants) who also analyzed the economics of a packer ecosystem. A software taggant is a form of code signing somewhat similar to Microsoft's Authenticode. The key differences between a software taggant and Authenticode are that the transparent and free addition of a software taggant for the end user of a runtime packer. Also, a software taggant may cover small critical areas of the program to minimize the cost of software integrity checking. To contrast, Authenticode always covers nearly the entire file so the cost of checking linearly depends on the file size. The software taggant project is run by IEEE ICSG and has open-source nature - it is hosted on GitHub and relies on OpenSSL.

The idea behind beer towers is that several patrons in a group can serve themselves the amount of beer they want without having to order individually. The device comes in a variety of sizes, most often double to triple the size of standard beer pitchers that hold around of beer. Early versions came in the shape of a four-foot tall plastic cylinder attached to a beer tap at the bottom. Current models sometimes have several dispensing valves, to allow for simultaneous dispense. Chilling of the beer is usually achieved with ice chambers or with freezable ice packs; these are traditionally located internally, but may be external for increased hygiene when handling. The actual dispense mechanism is usually in the form of a simplified beer tap or designed pouring mechanism. History A beer tower in Warsaw, Poland The ancestor of the modern beer tower was called a portable keg tap or a picnic tap, since the device was mostly used at outdoor events, such as picnics. They were significantly larger than modern beer towers. The method involved manually pumping air into the beer container; the resulting pressure within the container would force the beer out the tap. There was also a variant with lager beer barrels that stood upright, allowing gravity to force the beer out the tap, which is the principle of the modern day system. Usage =Southeast Asia and Australia= The beer tower is popular in bars and clubs throughout Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. Since 2012, the beer tower has appeared in Australian bars after first being used in Queensland. =United States= In March 2011, Boston licensing officials forbade bars from serving beer in beer towers. The officials required licensed alcohol serving businesses to request permission to use these beverage dispensers. =India= Self-service tabletop beer dispensers have been in use in India at least since 2017.

Durable sculptural processes traditionally include carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material), in stone, metal, clay, wood and other materials. In the modern era these were joined by assembly by welding, modelling, moulding and casting. Some installation art can also be considered to be sculpture. The earliest surviving sculptures from Scotland are standing stones and circles from around 3000 BCE. The oldest portable visual art are carved-stone petrospheres and the Westray Wife is the earliest representation of a human face found in Scotland. From the Bronze Age there are extensive examples of rock art, including cup and ring marks and elaborate carved stone battle-axes. By the early Iron Age Scotland had been penetrated by the wider European La T√®ne culture, and a few examples of decoration survive from Scotland. There are also decorated torcs, scabbards, armlets and war trumpets. The Romans began military expeditions into what is now Scotland from about 71 CE, leaving a direct sculptural legacy of distance slabs, altars and other sculptures. Among the most important survivals of Pictish culture are about 250 carved stones. Class I stones are largely unshaped and include incised animals, everyday objects and abstract symbols. Class II stones are carefully shaped slabs dating after the arrival of Christianity in the eighth and ninth centuries, with a cross on one face and a wide range of symbols on the reverse. Class III stones are elaborately shaped and incised cross-slabs, some with figurative scenes. Items of metalwork have been found throughout Pictland. D√°l Riata in the west of Scotland was a cross-roads between the artistic styles of the Picts and those of Ireland. There is evidence for the production of high-status jewellery, hanging bowls and other items that indicate that it was one of the locations where the Insular style was developed, which became common across Great Britain and Ireland. The most significant survivals in sculpture in Insular art are high crosses, large free-standing stone crosses, usually carved in relief with patterns, biblical iconography and occasionally inscriptions. Viking art avoided naturalism, favouring stylised animal motifs to create its ornamental patterns and later ribbon-interlace and plant motifs became fashionable. In the late Middle Ages examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture and a small number of significant crafted items have also survived. These include highly decorated sacrament houses, carving and monumental effigies. The greatest group of surviving sculptures from this period are from the West Highlands, beginning in the fourteenth century on Iona under the patronage of the Lordship of the Isles. There are also examples of carved chests and chess pieces. Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll as a result of Reformation iconoclasm, with the almost total loss of medieval religious sculpture. The tradition of stone and wood carving continued in royal palaces, the great houses of the nobility and even the humbler homes of lairds and burgesses. From the seventeenth century, there was elaborate use of carving in carved pediments, fireplaces, heraldic arms and classical motifs. Plasterwork also began to be used, often depicting flowers and cherubs. Many grand tombs for Scottish nobles were situated in Westminster Abbey, rather than in Scottish churches, but there are a few examples as fine as those in England. As in England, sculpture was dominated by foreign professionals. After the Acts of Union in 1707 there was very little patronage for large and expensive works of art in Scotland. The development of the Grand Tour led to the buying of artistic works including sculpture and interest in classical and Renaissance styles and Scots became the major figures in the trade in antique sculpture. With the growth of civic development there was an increasing demand for public statuary and the portrait bust also became popular. Commissions of new statuary tended to in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. From the late eighteenth century there are a handful of examples of work from Scottish artists. While opportunities and training for painters had made advances by the beginning of the nineteenth century, a Scottish tradition of professional sculpture was slower to emerge. There was a movement for the erection of major monuments, representing national sentiments and often focused on national figures. The troubled National Monument of Scotland in Edinburgh, remained controversial and failed to gain a consensus on its design. The first significant Scottish sculptor to pursue their career in Scotland was John Steell. This trend reached fruition in the next generation and a recognisable national school was established. Public sculpture was boosted by the centenary of Burns' death in 1896. The late nineteenth century saw the beginnings of the Arts and Crafts movement in Scotland. The major project of the Scottish National War Memorial within Edinburgh Castle, provided opportunities for sculptors, many of whom were drawn from Edinburgh College of Art, helping to cement an Arts and Craft ethos. However, a few artists pursued a more modernist agenda. After the Second World War a new generation of artists emerged, often more directly influenced by modernism. The establishment of the National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh in 1960 provided new possibilities for the display of sculpture. The 1970s saw the emergence of installation and environmental art. In the late twentieth century, new sources of direct government arts funding encouraged greater experimentation. Although the first sculpture park in Scotland was established in 1955, it was in the late 1970s and 1980s that they began to be fully developed. Ideas-based art began to dominate Scottish sculpture from the mid 1980s. A number of women sculptors, public artists and installation artists rose to prominence in what had been a male dominated area. Particularly significant were artists involved with the Transmission Gallery and Variant magazine in Glasgow. From the 1990s Scottish sculptural arts began to gain international attention. Prehistory =Stone Age= The Westray Wife, probably the oldest surviving representation of a human face from Scotland Scotland was occupied by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from around 8500 BCE, who were highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers.P. J. Ashmore, Neolithic and Bronze Age Scotland: an Authoritative and Lively Account of an Enigmatic Period of Scottish Prehistory (London: Batsford, 2003), , p. 46. From about 3000 BCE they introduced the many standing stones and circles such as those at Stenness on the mainland of Orkney, which date from about 3100 BCE.C. Wickham-Jones, Orkney: a Historical Guide (Birlinn, 2007), , p. 28. These were part of a pattern that developed in many regions across Europe at about the same time.F. Lynch, Megalithic Tombs and Long Barrows in Britain (Botley: Osprey, 1997), , p. 9. Probably the oldest examples of portable visual art to survive from Scotland are carved stone balls, or petrospheres, that date from the late Neolithic era. They are a uniquely Scottish phenomenon, with over 425 known examples. Most are from modern Aberdeenshire,\\"Carved stone ball found at Towie, Aberdeenshire\\", National Museums of Scotland, retrieved 14 May 2012. but a handful of examples are known from Iona, Skye, Harris, Uist, Lewis, Arran, Hawick, Wigtownshire and fifteen from Orkney, five of which were found at the Neolithic village of Skara Brae.D. N. Marshall, \\"Carved Stone Balls\\", Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, 108, (1976/77), pp. 62‚Äì3. Many functions have been suggested for these objects, most indicating that they were prestigious and powerful possessions. Their production may have continued into the Iron Age.J. Neil, G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, Scotland, Archaeology and Early History (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd end., 1991), , p. 46. The complex carved circles and spirals on these balls can be seen mirrored in the carving on what was probably a lintel from a chambered cairn at Pierowall on Westray, Orkney, which seem to be part of the same culture that produced carvings at Newgrange in Ireland.M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , pp. 10‚Äì11. Other items to survive from the period include elaborate carved stone maceheads, often found in burial sites, such as that found at Airdens in Sutherland, which has a pattern of interlocking diamond-shaped facets, similar to those found across Neolithic Britain and Europe. In 2009 the Westray Wife was discovered at the site of a Neolithic village at Links of Noltland near Grobust Bay on the north coast of Westray, a lozenge-shaped figurine that is believed to be the earliest representation of a human face ever found in Scotland. The face has two dots for eyes, heavy brows and an oblong nose and a pattern of hatches on the body could represent clothing. Two more figurines were found at the site in 2010 and 2012. =Bronze Age= Cup and ring marks at Cairnbaan, Argyll and Bute The Bronze Age began in Scotland about 2000 BCE as new metallurgical practices reached the region.C. Scarre, Monuments and Landscape in Atlantic Europe: Perception and Society During the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age (London: Routledge, 2002), p. 125. From this period there are extensive examples of rock art. These include cup and ring marks, a central depression carved into stone, surrounded by rings, sometimes not completed. These are common elsewhere in Atlantic Europe and have been found on natural rocks and isolated stones across Scotland. The most elaborate sets of markings are in western Scotland, particularly in the Kilmartin district. The representations of an axe and a boat at the Ri Cruin Cairn in Kilmartin, and a boat pecked into Wemyss Cave, are probably the oldest two- dimensional representations of real objects that survive in Scotland. Similar carved spirals have also been found on the cover stones of burial cists in Lanarkshire and Catterline.V. G. Childe, The Prehistory Of Scotland (London: Taylor and Francis, 1935), p. 115. There are also elaborate carved stone battle-axes found in East Lothian, Aberdeenshire and Lanarkshire. These show little sign of use or wear, so may be symbolic representations of power, rather than designed as weapons.M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , p. 12. Elaborate metal weaponry includes bronze leaf swords and ceremonial shields of sheet bronze made in Scotland between 900 and 600 BCE.M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , p. 13.

The \\"Ballachulish Figurine\\" is a life-sized female figure, dating from 700‚Äì500 BCE, in oak with quartz pebbles for eyes, found at Ballachulish, Argyll. It was located in a wickerwork structure in a peat bog which overlooks the entrance to a sea loch, which may have been a place of ritual significance and the figurine may be that of a goddess.I.

The Stirling torcs, found in 2009, are a group of four gold torcs in different styles, dating from 300 BCE and 100 BCE. Two demonstrate common styles found in Scotland and Ireland, but the other two indicate workmanship from what is now southern France, and the Greek and Roman worlds.\\"Iron Age Gold\\", National Museums of Scotland, retrieved 14 May 2012. The bronze Stichill collar is a large engraved necklace, fastened at the back a pin. The Mortonhall scabbard, probably from the first century CE, is elaborately decorated with trumpet curves and \\"S\\"-scrolls. Further north there are finds of massive bronze armlets, often with enamelled decoration, such as the ones found at Culbin Sands, Moray.R. Megaw and J. V. S. Megaw, Early Celtic Art in Britain and Ireland (Bodley: Osprey Publishing, 2nd edn., 2008), , pp. 72‚Äì4. One of the most impressive items from this period is the boar's head fragment of the Deskford carnyx, a war-trumpet from Deskford in Banffshire, probably dating from the first century CE. Similar instruments are mentioned in Roman sources and depicted on the Gundestrup Cauldron found in Denmark.M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , p. 16. In stone carving there are a number of simple stone heads from Scotland, like that found at Coupar Angus in Perthshire, that may date from the Iron Age. They are similar to those found across Great Britain and Ireland, although they are difficult to date and may have been made much later.I. Armit, Headhunting and the Body in Iron Age Europe (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), , pp. 34‚Äì5. =Roman influence= The Cramond Lioness found near the Roman base of Cramond Roman Fort near Edinburgh The Romans began military expeditions into what is now Scotland from about 71 CE, building a series of forts, but by 87 CE the occupation was limited to the Southern Uplands and by the end of the first century the northern extent of Roman occupation was a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth.W. S. Hanson, \\"The Roman Presence: Brief Interludes\\", in K. J. Edwards, I. B. M. Ralston, eds, Scotland After the Ice Age: Environment, Archaeology and History, 8000 BC ‚Äì AD 1000 (Edinburgh.

The Romans eventually withdrew to a line in what is now northern England, building the fortification known as Hadrian's Wall from coast to coast.\\"History\\", antoninewall.org, retrieved 25 July 2008. Around 141 CE they undertook a reoccupation of southern Scotland, moving up to construct a new limes between the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde, where they built the fortification known as the Antonine Wall. The wall was overrun and abandoned soon after 160 CE and the Romans withdrew back to Hadrian's Wall,D. J. Breeze, The Antonine Wall (Edinburgh: John Donald, 2006), , p. 167.A. Moffat, Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History (London: Thames and Hudson, 2005), , pp. 297‚Äì301. which they held until Roman authority collapsed in the early fifth century.W. S. Hanson, \\"The Roman presence: brief interludes\\", in K. J. Edwards and I. B. M. Ralston, eds, Scotland After the Ice Age: Environment, Archaeology and History, 8000 BC ‚Äì AD 1000 (Edinburgh University Press, 2003), p. 198. The Antonine Wall and its associated forts left a direct sculptural legacy in Scotland. There are 19 distance slabs along the wall that depict graphically the victories and marches of the legions involved in its construction. There are also surviving sculptures, including an altar to Diana and Apollo. There is a fountainhead from a bath-house in the shape of a man's head with a gaping mouth, and the head from a bust or statue, perhaps the goddess Fortuna, both found at Bearsden Roman Fort, East Dunbartonshire, both showing a local Celtic influence.The Antonine Wall: Rome's Final Frontier: Slideshow, Glasgow University, The Hunterian, retrieved 19 April 2014. Away from the wall Roman sculptures include the marble head of a Roman emperor or general, broken from a larger statue, which was found at Hawkshaw, Peebleshire in the late eighteenth century. It dates to the second century CE and may have been looted from a Roman monument further to the south.L. J. F. Keppie, Scotland's Roman Remains: an Introduction and Handbook (John Donald, 2nd edn., 1998), , p. 90. The Cramond Lioness is a sculpture, probably imported, of a lioness devouring a bound prisoner, found near the Roman base of Cramond Roman Fort near Edinburgh. A relief of the goddess Brigantia found near Birrens in Dumfriesshire, combines elements of native and classical art.M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , pp. 16‚Äì7. Medieval =Picts= The Dunnichen Stone, a Class I incised stone, with double disc and z-rod, mirror and comb and flower Pictish symbols The Picts were a large tribal confederation of Celtic peoples during the Late Iron Age and Early Medieval periods living in what is now eastern and northern Scotland. Among the most important survivals of Pictish culture are about 250 carved stones. They have been assigned by scholars to three classes.J. N. G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, Scotland, Archaeology and Early History (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 1991), , pp. 161‚Äì5. Class I stones are those thought to date to the period up to the seventh century and are the most numerous group. The stones are largely unshaped and include incised symbols of animals such as fish and the Pictish beast, everyday objects such as mirrors, combs and tuning forks and abstract symbols defined by names including v-rod, double disc and z-rod. They are found between from the Firth of Forth to Shetland. The greatest concentrations are in Sutherland, around modern Inverness and Aberdeen. Examples include the Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno stones (Angus).J. Graham-Campbell and C. E. Batey, Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), , pp. 7‚Äì8. Class II stones are carefully shaped slabs dating after the arrival of Christianity in the eighth and ninth centuries, with a cross on one face and a wide range of symbols on the reverse. In smaller numbers than Class I stones, they predominate in southern Pictland, in Perth, Angus and Fife. Examples include Glamis 2, which contains a finely executed Celtic cross on the main face with two opposing male figures, a centaur, cauldron, deer head and a triple disc symbol and Cossans, Angus, which shows a high-prowed Pictish boat with oarsmen and a figure facing forward in the prow. Class III stones are thought to overlap chronologically with Class II stones. Most are elaborately shaped and incised cross-slabs, some with figurative scenes, but lacking idiomatic Pictish symbols. They are widely distributed but predominate in the southern Pictish areas. Pictish symbols are also found elsewhere, including in the entrance to the Sculptor's Cave, to which they give its name, including the fish, crescent & v-rod, pentacle, triple vesica, step, mirror- case and rectangular symbols. Items of metalwork have been found throughout Pictland. The earlier Picts appear to have had a considerable amount of silver available, probably from raiding further south, or the payment of subsidies to keep them from doing so. The very large hoard of late Roman hacksilver found at Traprain Law may have originated in either way. The largest hoard of early Pictish metalwork was found in 1819 at Norrie's Law in Fife, but unfortunately much was dispersed and melted down.S. Youngs, ed., \\"The Work of Angels\\", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork, 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD (London: British Museum Press, 1989), , pp. 26‚Äì8. Over ten heavy silver chains, some over long, have been found from this period; the double-linked Whitecleuch Chain is one of only two that have a penannular ring, with symbol decoration including enamel, which shows how these were probably used as \\"choker\\" necklaces. The St Ninian's Isle Treasure of 28 silver and silver-gilt objects, contains perhaps the best collection of late Pictish forms, from the Christian period, when Pictish metalwork style, as with stone-carving, gradually merged with Insular, Anglo-Saxon and Viking styles.L. R. Laing, Later Celtic Art in Britain and Ireland (London: Osprey Publishing, 1987), , p. 37. =Irish-Scots= The Ruthwell Cross, showing the washing of Christ's feet Thomas Charles-Edwards has suggested that the kingdom of D√°l Riata in the west of Scotland was a cross-roads between the artistic styles of the Picts and those of Ireland, with which the Scots settlers in what is now Argyll kept close contacts. This can be seen in representations found in excavations of the fortress of Dunadd, which combine Pictish and Irish elements.T. M. Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , pp. 331‚Äì2. This included extensive evidence for the production of high status jewellery and moulds from the seventh century that indicate the production of pieces similar to the Hunterston brooch, found in Ayrshire, which may have been made in D√°l Riata, but with elements that suggest Irish origins. These and other finds, including a trumpet spiral decorated hanging bowl disc and a stamped animal decoration (or pressblech), perhaps from a bucket or drinking horn, indicate the ways in which D√°l Riata was one of the locations where the Insular style was developed.A. Lane, \\"Citadel of the first Scots\\", British Archaeology, 62, December 2001. Retrieved 2 December 2010. In the eighth and ninth centuries the Pictish elite adopted true penannular brooches with lobed terminals from Ireland. Some older Irish pseudo-penannular brooches were adapted to the Pictish style, for example the Breadalbane Brooch (British Museum). The eighth century Monymusk Reliquary, said to contain the remains of St. Columba, has elements of Pictish and Irish styles.S. Youngs, ed., \\"The Work of Angels\\", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork, 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD (London: British Museum Press, 1989), , pp. 109‚Äì113. =Anglo-Saxon and Insular styles= From the sixth century the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Bernicia, part of Northumbria, stretched into what is now Lowland Scotland. Early examples of Anglo-Saxon art from the region include exceptional items such as the intricately carved whalebone Franks Casket form the early eighth century, which combines pagan, classical and Christian motifs.C. R. Dodwell, Anglo- Saxon Art: A New Perspective (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1982), , pp. 2‚Äì4. After the Christianisation of Britain from the seventh century, artistic styles in Northumbria interacted with those in Ireland and what is now Scotland to become part of the common style historians have identified as Insular or Hiberno-Saxon.C. E Karkov, The Art of Anglo-Saxon England (Boydell Press, 2011), , p. 5. The most significant survivals in sculpture in Insular art are in high crosses. These are large free-standing stone crosses, usually carved in relief with patterns, biblical iconography and occasionally inscriptions. The tradition may have begun in Ireland or Anglo-Saxon England and then spread to Scotland.J. T. Koch, Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volumes 1‚Äì5 (ABC-CLIO, 2006), , pp. 915‚Äì19. They are found throughout the British Isles and often feature a stone ring around the intersection, forming a Celtic cross, apparently an innovation of Celtic Christianity, that may have begun at Iona.D. M. Wilson, Anglo-Saxon Art: From The Seventh Century To The Norman Conquest (Overlook Press, 1984), p. 118. Distribution in Scotland is heaviest in the Highlands and Islands and they can be dated to the period c. 750 to 1150. All the surviving crosses are of stone, but there are indications that large numbers of wooden crosses may also have existed. In Scotland biblical iconography is less common than in Ireland, but the subject of King David is relatively frequently depicted. In the east the influence of Pictish sculpture can be seen. Important examples dated to the eighth century include St Martin's Cross on Iona, the Kildalton Cross from the Hebrides and the Anglo-Saxon Ruthwell Cross. Through the Hiberno-Scottish mission to the continent, insular art was highly influential on subsequent European Medieval art, especially the decorative elements of Romanesque and Gothic styles.G. Henderson, Early Medieval Art (London: Penguin, 1972), , pp. 63‚Äì71. =Viking age= Some of the Lewis chessmen From the eighth century Scandinavian invaders took territories in the North and West of Scotland, included the Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland, the Hebrides and parts of the mainland. Viking art avoided naturalism, favouring stylised animal motifs to create its ornamental patterns. Ribbon-interlace was important and plant motifs became fashionable in the tenth and eleventh centuries.J. Graham- Campbell and C. E. Batey, Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), , p. 34. Most Scottish artefacts come from 130 \\"pagan\\" burials in the north and west from the mid- ninth to the mid-tenth centuries.M. Carver, The Cross Goes North: Processes of Conversion in Northern Europe, AD 300‚Äì1300 (Boydell Press, 2006), , p. 219. These include jewellery, weapons and occasional elaborate high status items.J. Jesch, Women in the Viking Age (Boydell & Brewer, 1991), , p. 14. Amongst the most impressive of these is the Scar boat burial, on Orkney, which contained an elaborate sword, quiver with arrows, a brooch, bone comb, gaming pieces and the Scar Dragon Plaque, made from whalebone, most of which were probably made in Scandinavia.K. Holman, The Northern [I. E. Northern] Conquest: Vikings in Britain and Ireland (Signal Books, 2007), , p. 137. From the west, another boat burial at Kiloron Bay in Colonsay revealed a sword, shield, iron cauldron and enamelled scales, which may be Celtic in origin.L. Laing, The Archaeology of Late Celtic Britain and Ireland C. 400‚Äì1200 AD (London: Taylor & Francis, 1975), , p. 201. A combination of Viking and Celtic styles can be seen in a penannular brooch from Pierowall in Orkney, which has a Pictish-style looped pin. It is about two inches in diameter, with traces of gilding, and probably housed a piece of amber surrounded by interweaving ribbons.W. Nolan, L. Ronayne and M. Dunlevy, eds, Donegal: History & Society: Interdisciplinary Essays on the History of an Irish County (Geography, 1995), , p. 96. After the conversion to Christianity, from the tenth to the twelfth centuries, stone crosses and cross-slabs in Viking occupied areas of the Highlands and Islands were carved with successive styles of Viking ornament.J. Koch, Celtic Culture: Aberdeen Breviary-Celticism (ABC-CLIO, 2006), , p. 918. They were frequently mixed with native interlace and animal patterns. Examples include the eleventh-century cross-slab from D√≥id Mh√†iri on the island of Islay, where the plant motifs on either side of the cross-shaft are based upon the Ringerike style of Viking art.J. Graham-Campbell and C. E. Batey. Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), , p. 90. The most famous artistic find from modern Scotland, the Lewis Chessmen, from Uig, were probably made in Trondheim in Norway, but contain some decoration that may have been influenced by Celtic patterns.M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , p. 31. =Late Middle Ages= The Apprentice Pillar from Roslyn Chapel Architectural evidence suggests that, while the Romanesque style peaked in much of Europe in the later eleventh century and early twelfth century, it was still reaching Scotland in the second half of the twelfth centuryR. N. Swanson, The Twelfth- Century Renaissance (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1999), , p. 155. and was revived in the late fifteenth century, perhaps as a reaction to the English perpendicular style that had come to dominate.T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 190. Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork and has not survived the impact of time and the Reformation.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 127‚Äì9. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture and a small number of significant crafted items have survived.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 57‚Äì9. The interiors of churches were often more elaborate before the Reformation, with highly decorated sacrament houses, such as the ones surviving at Deskford and Kinkell.I. D. Whyte and K. A. Whyte, The Changing Scottish Landscape, 1500‚Äì1800 (London: Taylor & Francis, 1991), , p. 117. The carvings at Rosslyn Chapel, created in the mid-fifteenth century, elaborately depicting the progression of the seven deadly sins, are considered some of the finest in the Gothic style.S. H. Rigby, A Companion to Britain in the Later Middle Ages (London: Wiley-Blackwell, 2003), , p. 532. Monumental effigies began to appear in churches from the thirteenth century and they were usually fully coloured and gilded. Many were founders and patrons of churches and chapels, including members of the clergy, knights and often their wives. In contrast to England, where the fashion for stone-carved monuments gave way to brass etchings, they continued to be produced until the end of the Medieval period, with the largest group dating from the fifteenth century,R. Brydall, The Monumental Effigies of Scotland: From the Thirteenth to the Fifteenth Century (Kessinger Publishing, 1895, rpt. 2010), .K. Stevenson, Chivalry and Knighthood in Scotland, 1424‚Äì1513 (Boydell Press, 2006), , pp. 125‚Äì8. including the elaborate Douglas tombs in the town of Douglas. Sometimes the best continental artists were employed, as for Robert I's elaborate tomb in Dunfermline Abbey, which was made in his lifetime by the Parisian sculptor Thomas of Chartres, but of which only fragments now survive. The greatest group of surviving sculptures from this period are from the West Highlands, beginning in the fourteenth century on Iona under the patronage of the Lordship of the Isles and continuing until the Reformation. Common motifs were ships, swords, harps and Romanesque vine leaf tracery with Celtic elements.M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , pp. 34‚Äì5. Surviving wood carving can be seen at King's College, Aberdeen and Dunblane Cathedral. Two secular small chests with carved whalebone panels and metal fittings illustrate some aspects of the Scottish arts. The Eglington and Fife Caskets are very similar and were probably made by the same workshop around 1500, as boxes for valuables such as jewellery or documents. The overall form of the caskets follows French examples, and the locks and metal bands are decorated in Gothic style with \\"simple decorations of fleurons and debased egg and dart\\" while the whalebone panels are carved in relief with a late form of Insular interwoven strapwork characteristic of late Medieval West Scotland.V. Glenn, Romanesque and Gothic: Decorative Metalwork and Ivory Carvings in the Museum of Scotland (National Museums of Scotland, 2003), , pp. 147 and 186‚Äì191. The Skye Chess piece is a single elaborate piece in carved walrus ivory, with two warriors carrying heraldic shields in a framework of openwork vegetation. It is thought to be Scottish, of the mid-thirteenth century, with aspects similar to both English and Norwegian pieces.V. Glenn, Romanesque and Gothic: Decorative Metalwork and Ivory Carvings in the Museum of Scotland (National Museums of Scotland, 2003), , pp. 146‚Äì147 and 178‚Äì181. Early modern era =Sixteenth century= Mid-16th century oak panel carving from a house in Dundee Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll as a result of Reformation iconoclasm, with the almost total loss of medieval religious sculpture.A. Thomas, The Renaissance, in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , pp. 198‚Äì9. In the West Highlands, where there had been a hereditary caste of monumental sculptors, the uncertainty and loss of patronage caused by the rejection of monuments in the Reformation meant that they moved into another branches of the Gaelic learned orders or took up other occupations. The lack of transfer of carving skills is noticeable in the decline in quality when gravestones were next commissioned from the start of the seventeenth century.J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488‚Äì1587 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 331. According to N. Prior, the nature of the Scottish Reformation may have had wider effects, limiting the creation of a culture of public display and meaning that art was channelled into more austere forms of expression with an emphasis on private and domestic restraint.N. Prior, Museums and Modernity: Art Galleries and the Making of Modern Culture (Berg, 2002), , p. 102. Although tradition of stone and wood carving in churches largely ended at the Reformation, it continued in royal palaces, the great houses of the nobility and even the humbler homes of lairds and burgesses.J. Warrack, Domestic Life in Scotland, 1488‚Äì1688: A Sketch of the Development of Furniture and Household Usage (1930, Forgotten books, reprint, 2012), pp. 76‚Äì82. The intricate lid of the fourteenth-century Bute mazer, carved from a single piece of whale bone, was probably created in the early sixteenth century.H. Fothringham, Scottish Gold and Silver Work (London: Pelican, 2nd edn., 1999), , p. 54. There are also the elaborately engraved Cadboll cup and the Galloway mazer, which both date from the mid-sixteenth century.\\"The Renaissance\\", National Museums of Scotland, retrieved 24 April 2014. At Stirling Castle, stone carvings on the royal palace from the reign of James V are taken from German patterns,C. McKean, The Scottish Chateau (Sutton, 2nd edn., 2004), , p. 90. and, such as the surviving carved oak portrait roundels from the King's Presence Chamber, known as the Stirling Heads, they include contemporary, biblical and classical figures.J. Dunbar, The Stirling Heads (London: RCAHMS/HMSO, 1975), , p. 21. These, and the elaborate Renaissance fountain at Linlithgow Palace (c. 1538.), suggest that there was a workshop with an established connected with the court in the early sixteenth century. A French wood carver Andrew Mansioun worked for the court and joined the Edinburgh craft incorporation, training apprentices.Michael Pearce, 'A French Furniture Maker and the 'Courtly Style' in Sixteenth-Century Scotland', Regional Furniture, 32 (2018), pp. 127-134. Some of the finest domestic wood carving is in the Beaton panels, may have been made for Cardinal Beaton's private apartments in St Andrews Castle and later installed in the dining room of Balfour House in Fife.H.

Plasterwork also began to be used, often depicting flowers and cherubs.T. W. West, Discovering Scottish Architecture (Botley: Osprey, 1985), , p. 68. Richly carved decoration on ordinary houses was common in the period. There is also the heraldic carving, such as the royal arms at Holyrood Palace, designed by the Dutch painter Jacob de Wet in 1677. Elaborate carving was used at Huntly Castle, rebuilt for George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly (1562‚Äì1636) in the early seventeenth century, in wooden panels that focused on heraldic images. Their \\"popish\\" overtones led to them being damaged by an occupying Covenanter army in 1640.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), , p. 46. The tradition of carving also survived in work such as the carved stone panels in the garden of Edzell Castle (c. 1600), where there are depictions of seven Cardinal Virtues, the seven Liberal Arts and the seven Planetary Deities; the now lost carving done for Edinburgh and Glasgow universities and in the many elaborate sundials of the seventeenth century, such as those at Newbattle Abbey. Many grand tombs for Scottish nobles were situated in Westminster Abbey, rather than in Scottish churches. Exceptions include the two tombs designed by the Flemish-born Maximilian Colt (d. post 1641), the leading sculptor at the English Jacobean court, for George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar in Dunbar parish church (c. 1611) and David Murray, 1st Viscount of Stormont in the Palace Chapel at Scone (c. 1618). Both have a kneeling figure derived from Tudor iconography.D. Howarth, \\"Sculpture and Scotland 1540‚Äì1700\\", in F. Pearson, ed., Virtue and Vision: Sculpture in Scotland 1540‚Äì1990 (Edinburgh: National Galleries of Scotland, 1991), , p. 28. From the late part of the century there is the monument to the murdered James Sharp (1618‚Äì79), Archbishop of St. Andrews, in Holy Trinity Church, St. Andrews. Probably carved in the Netherlands, the grandiose tomb shows the Archbishop in prayer above a carved tableaux of his martyrdom, flanked by Corinthian columns.T. Clifford, \\"Introduction\\", in F. Pearson, ed., Virtue and Vision: Sculpture in Scotland 1540‚Äì1990 (Edinburgh: National Galleries of Scotland, 1991), , p. 9. There are also the baroque tombs to James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry at Durisdeer, Dumfriesshire, and the William Douglas, 3rd Duke of Hamilton in St. Bride's Bothwell, Lanarkshire (both designed c. 1695), which are as grand as any contemporaneous monument in England.D.

Parliament House Members of the Mylne family dominated royal building and masonry in Scotland in the first half of the seventeenth century. John Mylne (c. 1589‚Äì1657) completed a statue of James VI begun by Benjamin Lambert after the latter's death in 1616 and his most famous work was the sundial in Holyrood (1633). Alexander Mylne (d. 1643) was primarily a sculptor and in 1635 executed the royal arms over the entrance of Parliament House and two years later the two figures of Justice and Mercy on the same building.D. Howarth, \\"Sculpture and Scotland 1540‚Äì1700\\", in F. Pearson, ed., Virtue and Vision: Sculpture in Scotland 1540‚Äì1990 (Edinburgh: National Galleries of Scotland, 1991), , pp. 28‚Äì9. As in England, in the late seventeenth century sculpture was dominated by foreign professionals. Dutch- born Grinling Gibbons (1648‚Äì1721) supplied four large lead statues to Glamis Castle and in 1701 he supplied seven chimney pieces to Dalkeith House, including one in red and white marble bearing the story of Neptune and Galatea. The equestrian statue of Charles II outside Parliament House (1684/5) was a lead replica of Gibbon's bronze statue at Windsor, the first in Britain to depict a monarch in classical dress. John Van Ost (fl. 1680‚Äì1729) supplied lead garden statuary for Hopetoun House and Drumlanrig Castle. Sir William Bruce (c. 1630‚Äì1710), the leading Scottish architect of the seventeenth century, favoured Dutch carvers for his realisation of Kinross House in Fife, where there are festoons, trophies and cornucopia around the doorways and gates. This may have included Jan van Sant Voort, a Dutch carver known to have been living in Leith, who supplied Bruce with a carved heraldic overdoor in 1679 and who worked on Bruce's rebuilding of Holyrood Palace. From 1674 the London plasterers George Funsterfield (fl. 1660‚Äì76) and John Houlbert (fl. 1674‚Äì79) worked for Bruce at Thirlestane, Berwickshire and at Holyroodhouse. Dunsterfield was also active at Balcaskie, Fife and probably at Kellie Castle, Fife.T. Clifford, \\"Introduction\\", in F. Pearson, ed., Virtue and Vision: Sculpture in Scotland 1540‚Äì1990 (Edinburgh: National Galleries of Scotland, 1991), , pp. 13‚Äì14. Modern era =Eighteenth century= Portrait of James Tassie by David Allan, c. 1781 After the Acts of Union in 1707 there was very little patronage for large and expensive works of art in Scotland. The royal family spent very little time in, or money on, Scottish palaces and many Scottish nobles followed the royal court to England, tending to invest in sculpture for their residences in London, rather than their estates in Scotland. In the late eighteenth century the development of the Grand Tour took young Scottish aristocrats to the continent, particularly Rome, which was home to the exiled Jacobite Stuarts, and led to the buying of artistic works including sculpture and interest in classical and Renaissance styles. In the second half of the century Scots became the major figures in the trade in antique sculpture, particularly Gavin Hamilton (1723‚Äì98), Colin Morison (1732‚Äì1801) and James Byres (1734‚Äì1817), making them the arbiters of British taste in this area. However, the only major Scottish collection of marble before the nineteenth century was that of James Johnstone, 2nd Marquess of Annandale.B. Skinner, \\"Scottish Connoisseurship and the Grand Tour\\" in F. Pearson, ed., Virtue and Vision: Sculpture in Scotland 1540‚Äì1990 (Edinburgh: National Galleries of Scotland, 1991), , pp. 39‚Äì40. With the growth of civic development there was an increasing demand for public statuary, often with the patronage of a public institution, such as the lead figure of George II at the newly founded Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh in 1753 or the figure of the judge Duncan Forbes for the Outer Parliament House in 1752. The portrait bust, designed for interior display, also became popular. By the middle of the century were being preferred to painted portraits among the aristocracy.M. Baker, \\"'Proper ornaments for a library or Grotto': London sculptors and their Scottish patrons in the eighteenth century\\" in F. Pearson, ed., Virtue and Vision: Sculpture in Scotland 1540‚Äì1990 (Edinburgh: National Galleries of Scotland, 1991), , p. 47. As in England, commissions of new statuary tended to in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. The plasterwork of John Cheere's yard in London was particularly in demand. Also important was the work from the yard of John Bacon (1740‚Äì99) who produced a monument for Robert Dundas (d. 1787) at Borthwick Church and one for Mrs Allardyce (d. 1787) at West Church, Aberdeen. Bacon was also a partner in Mrs Eleanor Coade's Artificial Stone Manufactory at Lambeth in London. This produced a buff coloured ceramic that could be moulded to provide fine detail, and be fired in sections, but was impervious to frost and fire. Much cheaper than carved stone, Coadstone was used for sphinxes, balustrading, capitals, coat of arms, tablets, ornamental vases, church monuments and fonts. It was used extensively by the Adam brothers, particularly in the houses they built in Scotland, such as Cullen, Banff, Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, Dunbar Castle, East Lothian, Register House, Edinburgh, Gosford House, East Lothian and Wedderburn, Berwickshire. As well as supplying sculpture, candelabra and cippi, the Adam family supplied designs to the Carron Company, founded in 1759, which produced a wide range of iron products, including stoves, safes, vases and tablets.T. Clifford, \\"Introduction\\", in F. Pearson, ed., Virtue and Vision: Sculpture in Scotland 1540‚Äì1990 (Edinburgh: National Galleries of Scotland, 1991), , pp. 14‚Äì15. From the late eighteenth century there are a handful of examples of work from Scottish artists. These included statues of druids on the portico of Penicuik House carved by one \\"Willie Jeans\\" in 1776; the marble bust of James Gillespie by the obscure Robert Burn (fl. 1790‚Äì1816) and the bronze figure in Roman armour at the City Chambers, Edinburgh, which may represent Charles Edward Stuart or Louis XV. James Tassie (1735‚Äì99) was born in Glasgow and trained as a stonemason. He attended the Foulis Academy, founded in Glasgow in 1754 by the printmaking brothers Robert and Andrew Foulis, before moving to Dublin and then London. He developed a formula for making casts in vitreous paste and manufactured casts of antique carved gems. He also produced portrait medallions and among his sitters were many leading figures in Scottish intellectual life, such as Adam Smith, David Hume and Henry Raeburn. His medallions were popular when produced in Wedgwood jasper and were used by the Carron Company to be cast in iron.T. Clifford, \\"Introduction\\", in F. Pearson, ed., Virtue and Vision: Sculpture in Scotland 1540‚Äì1990 (Edinburgh: National Galleries of Scotland, 1991), , p. 16. =Nineteenth century= David Watson Stevenson's statue of William Wallace on the exterior of the Wallace Monument While opportunities and training for painters had made advances by the beginning of the nineteenth century, a Scottish tradition of professional sculpture was slower to emerge. In the early decades of the century commissions continued to be given to English artists, including Samuel Joseph (1791‚Äì1850), who was working in Edinburgh in 1821‚Äì29 and was a founding member of the Scottish Academy. Thomas Campbell (c. 1790‚Äì1858) studied in London and settled in Rome, where he received commissions from visiting British subjects before returning to London in 1830. His works in Scotland included the Hopetoun Memorial (1824‚Äì34) in Edinburgh. Lawrence Macdonald (1799‚Äì1878) was able to study at the Trustees Academy in Edinburgh and then Rome. He returned to Edinburgh from 1827, but moved back to Rome in 1832, where he worked for the rest of his life. His most significant works included his busts of General David Baird and of the phrenologist George Combe (c. 1830).M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , pp. 90‚Äì1. There was a movement for the erection of major monuments, representing national sentiments and often focused on national figures. The troubled National Monument of Scotland in Edinburgh, proposed in 1816 to commemorate the Scottish dead of the Napoleonic Wars, was envisioned as a pillar, arch, church and eventually was modelled on the Parthenon in Athens by Charles Robert Cockerell and William Henry Playfair and moved sites from the Mound to Calton Hill, where the foundation stone was laid in 1822. It remained controversial and failed to gain a consensus on its design. The Scott Monument in Princes Street Gardens (1840‚Äì48) in Edinburgh was an elaborate structure built in the Gothic style, designed by carpenter and self-taught architect George Meikle Kemp. The Wallace Monument, paid for by public subscription and built from 1861 to 1869, is a tower overlooking the site of the Battle of Stirling Bridge.C. Withers, \\"Monuments\\", in M. Lynch, ed., Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), , pp. 427‚Äì8. The first significant Scottish sculptor to pursue their career in Scotland was John Steell (1804‚Äì91). He trained at the Trustee's Academy and in Rome and was elected to the Scottish Academy in 1830 while still in his twenties. The first work of his to gain significant public attention was Alexander and Bucephasus. His 1832 design for a statue of Sir Walter Scott was incorporated into the author's memorial in Edinburgh. It marked the beginnings of a national school of sculpture based around major figures from Scottish culture and Scottish and British history. He was created the first Sculptor in Ordinary for Scotland by Queen Victoria.\\"No ordinary sculptor\\", The Scottish Government, 30 December 2008. The tradition of Scottish sculpture was taken forward by artists such as Patrick Park (1811‚Äì55), Alexander Handyside Ritchie (1804‚Äì70) and William Calder Marshall (1813‚Äì94). This reached fruition in the next generation of sculptors including William Brodie (1815‚Äì81), Amelia Hill (1820‚Äì1904) and Steell's apprentice David Watson Stevenson (1842‚Äì1904). Stevenson contributed the statue of William Wallace on the exterior of the Wallace Monument and many of the busts in the gallery of heroes inside, which included Robert the Bruce, John Knox, Walter Scott, Robert Burns, James Watt and Thomas Carlyle. Public sculpture was boosted by the centenary of Burns' death in 1896. Stevenson produced a statue of the poet in Leith. Hill produced one for Dumfries. John Steell produced a statue for Central Park in New York, versions of which were made for Dundee, London and Dunedin. Statues of Burns and Scott were produced in areas of Scottish settlement, particularly in North America and Australia and in Montreal.M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , pp. 125‚Äì7. The late nineteenth century saw the beginnings of the Arts and Crafts movement in Scotland, influenced by William Morris, Ford Madox Brown and John Ruskin. It began with the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered by James Ballantine (1808‚Äì77).M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , p. 151. It also influenced the Glasgow-born designer and theorist Christopher Dresser (1834‚Äì1904) was one of the first, and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the Aesthetic Movement and a major contributor to the allied Anglo-Japanese movement. He produced carpets, ceramics, furniture, glass, graphics, metalwork, including silver and electroplate, including his angular teapot of 1879.H. Lyons, Christopher Dresser: The People Designer ‚Äì 1834‚Äì1904 (Antique Collectors' Club, 2005), . =Early twentieth century= Hew Lorimer's Our Lady of the Isles (1957) on South Uist The late nineteenth century and early twentieth century saw the emergence of the Glasgow School, a term that is used for a number of loose groups based around the city. The most important grouping, active from about 1890 and known as \\"The Four\\" or the \\"Spook School\\", included acclaimed architect and artist Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868‚Äì1928). They produced a distinctive blend of influences, including the Celtic Revival, the Arts and Crafts Movement, and Japonisme, which found favour throughout the modern art world of continental Europe and helped define the Art Nouveau style.S. Tschudi-Madsen, The Art Nouveau Style: a Comprehensive Guide (Mineola, NY: Courier Dover, 2002), , pp. 283‚Äì4. Beside important buildings and paintings, Mackintosh also produced significant and influential objects, including his 1904 designs for an order desk chair for the Willow Tea Rooms in Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, based on a highly geometrised version of the willow tree, and his Revolving Bookcase for Hous'hill, which prefigured the international style of the next generation.M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , pp. 144‚Äì5. The major project of the Scottish National War Memorial within Edinburgh Castle, built by Robert Lorimer (1864‚Äì1929) to commemorate the dead of the First World War from 1924 to 1927, provided opportunities for sculptors, many of whom were drawn from Edinburgh College of Art. These included Percy Portsmouth (1874‚Äì1953), Alice Meredith Williams (1880‚Äì1934), and her husband Morris Meredith Williams (1881‚Äì1973), Alexander Carrick (1882‚Äì1966), Pilkington Jackson (1887‚Äì1973) and Phyllis Bone (1894‚Äì1972). The project helped cement an Arts and Craft ethos in Scottish sculpture, which was perpetuated Carrick's students Tom Whalen (1903‚Äì75) and Hew Lorimer (1907‚Äì93), the son of the architect Robert. Lorimer briefly studied with the leading Arts and Crafts sculptor Eric Gill and contributed several major works of public sculpture, including the high granite Our Lady of the Isles (1957), situated on South Uist. In contrast to the prevailing Arts and Crafts ethos in Scotland, influences from contemporary Europe were contributed to sculpture by J. D. Fergusson, best known as one of the Scottish Colourists. As in his painting, his sculpture, like the bronze bust Eastre (Hymn to the Sun) (1924), incorporated a modernist sensibility.M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , p. 170. Contemporary developments were also significant in the career of Benno Schotz. Born in Estonia of Jewish descent, he originally came to Glasgow as an engineer, but changed to sculpture, producing work influenced by Auguste Rodin and Jacob Epstein. His works included the female figure of The Lament (1943), which focused on the anguish of the Holocaust. His influence was extended by his tenure as head of Sculpture at Glasgow School of Art.D. Hall, \\"The twentieth century\\" in F. Pearson, ed., Virtue and Vision: Sculpture in Scotland 1540‚Äì1990 (Edinburgh: National Galleries of Scotland, 1991), , pp. 115 and 119. Eric Schilsky (1898‚Äì1974), born in England, worked in the existing tradition of modelling and carving,D. Macmillan, \\"Culture: modern times 1914‚Äì\\":art, in M. Lynch, ed., Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), , pp. 153‚Äì4. but his work had a European sensibility that was particularly influential during his time as director of sculpture at Edinburgh College of Art.D. Hall, \\"The twentieth century\\" in F. Pearson, ed., Virtue and Vision: Sculpture in Scotland 1540‚Äì1990 (Edinburgh: National Galleries of Scotland, 1991), , p. 115. =Late twentieth century to the present= Eduardo Paolozzi's Head of Invention (1989), installed in front of the Design Museum on the Thames at Butler's Wharf, London After the Second World War a new generation of artists emerged, often more directly influenced by modernism. George Innes (1913‚Äì70) experimented with pre-Columbian and Cubist-influenced primitivism. Primitivism was also an influence on the early work of William Turnbull (1922‚Äì2012) and Eduardo Paolozzi (1924‚Äì2005), who met at the Slade School of Fine Art after the war and both later studied in Paris. Turnbull's War Goddess (1956) is a commentary on the horrors of technological warfare and Paelozzi's Icarus (1957) deals with the classical myth of an individual overreaching themselves.M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , pp. 179‚Äì80. Paolozzi became a pioneer of pop art in the 1960s and in the 1980s and 1990s produced massive public bronze sculptures. Many works that examined juxtapositions between myth, fantasy and the modern world.L. A. Rose, M. Macaroon, V. Crow (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 12th edn., 2012), , p. 25. Ian Hamilton Finlay's (1925‚Äì2006) work existed outside of any obvious movement, but nevertheless he emerged as a key figure in Scottish art. He explored the boundaries between sculpture, print making, literature (especially concrete poetry) and landscape architecture. His most ambitious work, the garden of Little Sparta opened in 1960 and mixes landscape, sculpture and text. George Wyllie (1921‚Äì2012), produced works of social and political commentary including the Straw Locomotive (1987), an event which raised questions about the decline of heavy industry and the nature of colonialism.M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , p. 202. The establishment of the National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh in 1960 provided new possibilities for the display of sculpture. The grounds were initially dominated by two pieces by Henry Moore (1898‚Äì86), which were late joined by other major works, including those by Scottish artists. The 1970s saw the emergence of installation and environmental art.M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , p. 203. Members of the Boyle Family (Mark Boyle, 1934‚Äì2005, Jullia Hills, b. 1936, and their two children, Sebastian, b. 1962, and Georgia, b. 1963) have produced work that has included performances and earth sculptures. Their Journey to the Surface of the Earth project, begun in 1967, involved the re-creation of randomly chosen, sections of the earth's surface, designed to challenge ideas of representation and objectivity.A. Patrizio, Contemporary Sculpture in Scotland (Sydney: Craftsman House, 1999), , p. 22. The short-lived Ceramic Workshop in Edinburgh (1970‚Äì74) hosted installations by Merilyn Smith (b. 1942) and the Romanian artist Paul Neagu (1938‚Äì2004), but demonstrated both interest in the medium and the problems of funding it. It was boosted by the appointment of David Harding (b. 1937) to be the first head of the Department of Environmental Art at Glasgow School of Art in 1985.M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , p. 206. David Mach's Big Heids (1999), Lanarkshire, a tribute to the Scottish steel industry In the late twentieth century, new sources of direct government arts funding encouraged greater experimentation, which incorporated aspects of modernism. Among the next generation of sculptors such as Jake Harvey (b. 1948), Doug Cocker (b. 1945), Ainslie Yule (b. 1941) and Gavin Scobie (1940‚Äì2012). In contrast to the prevailing trends of modernism and conceptual art Sandy Stoddart (b. 1959) works primarily on \\"nationalist\\" figurative sculpture in clay within the neoclassical tradition. He is best known for his civic monuments, including bronze statues of the philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith (both 1996), on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh.C. Aslet, \\"Alexander Stoddart: talking statues\\" The Daily Telegraph, retrieved 12 July 2008. Ideas-based art began to dominate Scottish sculpture from the mid 1980s. A number of women sculptors, public artists and installation artists rose to prominence in what had been a male dominated area. These included Kirsty McGhie (b. 1959), Sybille von Halem (b. 1963) and Claire Barclay (b. 1968), all of whom were graduates of Environmental Art at Glasgow.A. Patrizio, Contemporary Sculpture in Scotland (Sydney: Craftsman House, 1999), , p. 13. Particularly significant were artists involved with the Transmission Gallery and Variant magazine in Glasgow. Of these Douglas Gordon went on to win the Turner Prize in 1996 and Christine Borland (b. 1965) was short-listed the following year. Contemporary sculptors that have emerged since the 1980s include David Mach (b. 1960), working in the mediums of sculpture and installation art. He has produced work including his Big Heids (1997), which provided a commentary on the declining iron industry.P.

The Scottish Sculpture Trust founded in 1978 established the Highland Sculpture Park that year. A similar project was soon begun at Glenshee. The Scottish Sculpture Workshop, begun by sculptor Fred Bushe (1931‚Äì2009) in 1979, organised the first Scottish Sculpture Open at Kildrummy Castle in 1981 in Aberdeenshire and it became an annual event. The Cramond Sculpture Park was set up in Edinburgh in 1985 to accommodate the mixed media work emerging from art schools in Scotland. The Highland Sculpture Park, Glenshee and Cramond all closed within a few years, but there are numerous other parks within Scotland.A.

During testing of the device, Capt. Tom Arnett (John Agar), leading an escort of North American F-86 Sabre jet fighters, is unable to prevent Olmstead's North American B-25 Mitchell bomber being shot down in North Korea. His commanding officer, Col. Catlett (George Cisar) plans a rescue of the scientist, whom he believes is still alive and may be undergoing interrogation by Soviet intelligence agents working with the North Koreans. Arnett and Lt. Bill Clairborn (Gregory Walcott) are assigned to go into North Korea and bring back Olmstead. After parachuting behind enemy lines, they meet up with guerrilla leader Capt. Chon (Victor Sen Yung), who takes them to Tanya Nikova (Audrey Totter), a Russian nurse, who has been working as a spy for the guerrillas. Tanya had previously been romantically involved with Arnett, but proves invaluable to the mission. She knows that the scientist may be under care of her boss, Col. Kuban (Robert Carricart), a Russian doctor. After they discover Olmstead's whereabouts and bring him out of the prison camp where he was being treated for a concussion, the group is pursued by North Korean Maj. Wan (Leonard Strong). Tanya is wounded during the escape but manages to drive the Americans to an airfield. She dies, but the two American pilots and the scientist make good their escape in a pair of North Korean MiG-15 jet fighters. However Clairborn deliberately crashes his plane into a attacking Korean fighter being unable to discover how to fire the Mig's guns. Cast * John Agar as Capt.

It is one of the earliest settlements in the town, settled by Eli Morse in 1764, and has been in the hands of just two families. Its transformation to summer resort use was one of the first in the Dublin Pond area. The farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Eli Morse Farm is located on the south side of Lake Road, extending southward from the outlet of Dublin Pond at its southwest corner. The property is more than in size, including areas of both open fields and woodlands. The main house is a large Federal style brick structure built c. 1822 by Eli Morse's son Thaddeus. Additions were made to the house in 1886, including a porch and front portico. The farmstead includes several outbuildings, including a barn, grist mill, and several cottages. This land was settled in 1764 by Eli Morse, one of Dublin's first permanent settlers. Morse served as a clerk of the community and left an invaluable record of Dublin's early history. His son Thaddeus, who built the house, was also active in civic affairs, serving as town selectman and in other offices. His son, Thaddeus Jr., opened the house as a boarding house for summer guests in 1857, one of the first such uses of an agricultural property near Dublin Pond. Morse's heirs sold the property to Mrs Sarah Peele, and the property has remained in the hands of her descendants since then. The farm is also notable as the summer estate of New York City lawyer and diplomat Grenville Clark, who acquired the property after marrying a Peele granddaughter. Clark organized a peace conference in 1945, held at this site, at which attendees drafted the Dublin Declaration, calling for the United Nations to be created as a world government. The Clark family continues to own the property, maintaining for agricultural and conservation purposes.

Established in the early 1800s as a trading post with the Choctaw people, the community today is a rural crossroads. History Agency began as a government trading post established to maintain contact with the Choctaw people. The post was located on Robinson Road, about east of the Noxubee River. Robinson Road connected the cities of Columbus, Jackson, and Natchez, and is the second oldest road in Mississippi. Government workers were employed at Agency as early as 1813, and Colonel Ward was in charge. Ward's house fronted the north side of Robinson Road, and consisted of two large rooms made of hewn logs. The cellar was made of brick, and was described as a \\"dungeon\\" used to confine fugitive slaves. Slaves who fled plantations in Mississippi and Alabama would seek asylum with the Choctaw people. The Choctaw, themselves slave owners, would deliver the fugitives to Colonel Ward, who would lock them in stocks in his cellar. The early settlement also had a storehouse, blacksmith shop, and stables. The agency house was abandoned in 1832, and the building was demolished in the 1840s. The Choctaw council house was situated on the east bank of Noxubee river, about southeast of Agency, just north of the county line. The place later became known as \\"Council Bluff\\". By the 1850s, Agency had flourished as a stagecoach stop, and had exceeded nearby Starkville in trade. Jefferson Davis spoke at the community center in Agency in the 1850s. Agency had a school, a post office by 1854, a Masonic Grand Lodge from 1861 to 1872, and one of Oktibbeha County's three \\"dens\\" of the Ku Klux Klan. John J. Walker and his wife Marie lived in Agency during the mid-1800s. A letter addressed to \\"Mrs. John J. Walker, Choctaw Agency, Oktibbeha County, Mississippi\\" has been preserved in the archive at Mississippi State University Library. The stamped envelope, however, was made public and sold for $21,000. By 1870, Agency had a population of 4,170 people. Around that time, the Mobile and Ohio Railroad completed a line east of Agency. Without railway access, the town's prosperity was undermined, and by 1887, Agency's last store closed. In 1894, its last doctor moved to Starkville. By 1900, Agency had a population of 30, and in 1905, its post office closed. Agency today is covered by forest, and there are some homes on Robinson Road.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history Mountain View Farm stands in an isolated rural setting south of Dublin village, on the eastern slope of Mount Monadnock. It is at the end of Close Road, its access drive from Upper Jaffrey Road. The house consists of two parts. The main portion is a two-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It has a nearly symmetrical six-bay facade, with a hip- roofed single-story porch extending across its width, and three gabled dormers projecting from the roof. Attached is an older 1-1/2 story ell, whose exterior has been altered to match that of the main block, but whose interior retains many original 18th-century features. The ell was built about 1780 by Nathan Bixby, a major landowner, Revolutionary War veteran, and prominent citizen of the town. In the late 19th century the house was acquired by George and Alice Upton, who in 1903 commissioned John Lawrence Mauran, a prominent Chicago architect, to design a Georgian Revival summer house, to which the older house was attached as a wing. The best-known occupant of the house was Mark Twain, who rented it for his second visit to Dublin in 1906.

Bossard Group is listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange SIX Swiss Exchange.  History  The Bossard hardware store in 1831 The company was founded in 1831 in Zug as a hardware store by Franz Kaspar Bossard-Kolin. The earlier silk trading business inherited from his father-in-law was dissolved at the same time. The hardware store kept its local character roughly a century before the company expanded its business activity in the 1930s and 1940s to trading fasteners. The local specialized store first developed into a regional, and from the 1950s into a national, company. From the 1960s Bossard began to set up and expand an international network of bases. In the course of expansion, the company went public on the stock market in 1987. The recession at the beginning of the 1990s and the associated worsening business trend led Bossard to a review of the entire organization. In doing so the company focused on the core competence of fastening technology and the gradual selling off of all its tools, fittings and handicraft units. Bossard is active in the field of fastening technology in Europe, America and Asia. In November 2012, the Bossard group acquired the KVT Koenig Group's range of fastening technology.Bossard acquires part of KVT Group http://www.zug4you.ch/cms/output.php?id=353&article;_id=5742 In April 2019, during the AGM in Zug, Switzerland, David Dean was elected to the Bossard Holding board of directors, after having worked for the company for 15 years.

The book expounds his arguments from natural theology, making a teleological argument for the existence of God, notably beginning with the watchmaker analogy. The book was written in the context of the natural theology tradition. In earlier centuries, theologians such as John Ray and William Derham, as well as philosophers of classical times such as Cicero, argued for the existence and goodness of God from the general well-being of living things and the physical world. Paley's Natural Theology is an extended argument, constructed around a series of examples including finding a watch; comparing the eye to a telescope; and the existence of finely adapted mechanical structures in animals, such as joints which function like hinges or manmade ball and socket joints. Paley argues that these all lead to an intelligent Creator, and that a system is more than the sum of its parts. The last chapters are more theological in character, arguing that the attributes of God must be sufficient for the extent of his operations, and that God must be good because designs seen in nature are beneficial. The book was many times republished and remains in print. It continues to be consulted by creationists. Charles Darwin took its arguments seriously and responded to them; evolutionary biologists such as Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Dawkins also responded to such ideas by referencing Paley's book. Context The main thrust of William Paley's argument in Natural Theology is that God's design of the whole creation can be seen in the general happiness, or well-being, that is evident in the physical and social order of things. This sets the book within the broad tradition of the Enlightenment's natural theology; and this explains why Paley based much of his thought on John Ray (1691), William Derham (1711) and Bernard Nieuwentyt (1750).National Center for Science Education \\"Paley the Plagiarist?\\" Glenn Branch Paley's argument is built mainly around anatomy and natural history. \\"For my part\\", he says, \\"I take my stand in human anatomy\\"; elsewhere he insists upon \\"the necessity, in each particular case, of an intelligent designing mind for the contriving and determining of the forms which organized bodies bear\\". In making his argument, Paley employed a wide variety of metaphors and analogies. Perhaps the most famous is his analogy between a watch and the world. Historians, philosophers and theologians often call this the watchmaker analogy. Building on this mechanical analogy, Paley presents examples from planetary astronomy and argues that the regular movements of the solar system resemble the workings of a giant clock. To bolster his views he cites the work of his old friend John Law and the Dublin Astronomer Royal John Brinkley. The germ of the idea is to be found in ancient writers who used sundials and Ptolemaic epicycles to illustrate the divine order of the world. These types of examples can be seen in the work of the ancient philosopher Cicero, especially in his De Natura Deorum, ii. 87 and 97. The watch analogy was widely used in the Enlightenment, by deists and Christians alike. Outline The first page of Natural Theology, introducing Paley's version of the watchmaker analogy ;Chapter I. State of the Argument :The basic watchmaker analogy: if you find a watch, you suppose there's a watchmaker. ;Chapter II. State of the Argument continued :Now the watch can reproduce itself. Paley argues that the watchmaker must have power, and specific intentions. ;Chapter III. Application of the Argument :Paley says it is atheism not to agree with the watchmaker argument. He compares the eye to a telescope, and argues from the eye's construction. ;Chapter IV Of the Succession of Plants and Animals :Paley argues from the properties of plant seeds and animal eggs. ;Chapter V. Application of the Argument continued :The argument is extended to 'all the organized parts of the works of nature'. Paley considers whether chance alone could explain these, and concludes not. ;Chapter VI. The Argument cumulative :No argument, writes Paley, other than 'the necessity of an intelligent Creator', can explain the eye (or any other elaborate living structure). ;Chapter VII. Of the Mechanical And Immechanical Parts and Functions of Animals and Vegetables :Animals use muscles to move; even if we don't understand how they work, we can see they work mechanically, argues Paley, moving joints to and fro. Other organs such as the stomach work chemically to digest food. ;Chapter VIII. Of Mechanical Arrangement in the human Frame :The bones and joints form a mechanical structure with features comparable to hinges, mortice and tenon and ball and socket joints, etc., to provide both support and suitable flexibility. He compares the spine to The Iron Bridge at Bishop Wearmouth. ;Chapter IX. Of the Muscles :The muscles exactly relate to the joints, operating them mechanically like the wires and strings of a puppet. A complex case is the tongue. Sphincter muscles are admired also. ;Chapter X. Of the Vessels of Animal Bodies :The blood vessels and lymph vessels are considered, the valves of the heart, and the separate functions of arteries and veins. Paley argues that such functions as that of the epiglottis could not have formed gradually (as by evolution). ;Chapter XI. Of the Animal Structure regarded as a Mass :Paley considers the bilateral symmetry of animals, and how well-packaged all the delicate organs are, resulting in both beauty and utility. Red crossbill skull and jaw anatomy from William Yarrell's A History of British Birds; the crossbill's beak is cited by Paley as being well-suited to its function. ;Chapter XII. Comparative Anatomy :Paley considers the equivalents of human anatomy in other animals. Human clothing is compared to the fur, feathers, quills and scales of animals. The structure of the feather is admired. The teeth and jaws of carnivores, herbivores and omnivores are considered. Similarly, the adaptations of birds' bills in species like the crossbill, spoonbill and (long-billed) snipe are discussed. ;Chapter XIII. Peculiar Organizations :Paley considers organs which seem to have no comparison, like the oil glands of birds and swim bladders of fishes. ;Chapter XIV. Prospective Contrivances :Paley considers how some structures are seen to be prepared for future function, like the milk-teeth of a baby, ready formed inside the gums at birth. Similarly, the circulation of the foetus is supported by temporary short-circuits with the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus, as the lungs are not yet in use for breathing. ;Chapter XV. Relations :Paley considers how the whole of a system is more than the sum of its parts. This is seen to be so both in a mechanical watch and in living systems. ;Chapter XVI. Compensation :The 'defects' of one organ are remedied by the structure of another. The elephant has, Paley argues, a short neck because its head is so heavy, but in compensation it has a long trunk, enabling it to reach out. Similarly the spider has no wings to enable it to chase its flying prey, but has a web, and organs adapted to produce it, which compensates for the lack. ;Chapter XVII. The Relation of animated Bodies to inanimate Nature :Organs such as the wings of birds and the fins of fish are expressly adapted to the surrounding 'elements' of air or water in which they operate. ;Chapter XVIII. Instincts :Instincts enable newly hatched young of salmon to find food, and later to migrate to the sea and finally back to their rivers to spawn. Paley mentions the ovipositors of insects such as ichneumons, able to lay eggs deep in wood. ;Chapter XIX. Of Insects :\\"WE are not writing a system of natural history\\", begins Paley, apologising for not covering every class systematically. He mentions insects for some examples unique to them, as the antennae, elytra (scaly wing-cases), ovipositors (he calls them 'awls') for laying eggs deep in plants or wood, stings, the proboscis of bees, the light-producing organ of the glow-worm and so on. ;Chapter XX. Of Plants :Admitting that plants generally have less obvious evidence of 'a designed and studied mechanism' than animals, still Paley adds some examples, as of the parts of the seed, the delicate germ being protected by a tough or spiny husk, and dispersed by wings or other appendages. ;Chapter XXI. Of the Elements :Paley considers how the 'elements' of water, air etc. are exactly as needed. ;Chapter XXII. Astronomy :Paley admits that astronomy is not the best proof of 'the agency of an intelligent Creator', but all the same it shows his magnificence. ;Chapter XXIII. Personality of the Deity :All the above items show the 'contrivances' in existence, which Paley argues prove the personality of the Deity, arguing that only persons can contrive or design. ;Chapter XXIV. Of the natural Attributes of the Deity :The attributes of God must, Paley argues, be 'adequate to the magnitude, extent, and multiplicity of his operations'. ;Chapter XXV. Of the Unity of the Deity :Paley argues that the uniformity of plan seen in the universe indicates a single God. ;Chapter XXVI. The Goodness of the Deity :God must be good, Paley argues, because in many cases the designs seen in nature are beneficial, and because animals perceive pleasure, beyond what would be strictly necessary. Pain is admitted to exist, but even such things as venomous bites of snakes exist to a good end, namely defence or the capture of prey. Pain too is mitigated, as in intervals between the acute pain of gout which are beneficial to sufferers. The appearance of chance, too, is necessary in the world. ;Chapter XXVII. Conclusion :Paley concludes that natural theology offers many proofs of the goodness of God, though any one would be sufficient. The many proofs show that the conclusion is stable, and together they can make a suitable impression on those who study them. Editions The first edition of Natural Theology: or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity was published in 1802 in London by J. Faulder. In the United States, the book was published and released by E Sargeant and Company of New York on December 15, 1802. A later edition published by E. S. Gorham contained revisions by F. LeGros Clark in order to \\"harmonize with modern science\\". The book was republished in many editions by publishers in cities including London, Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and Philadelphia. The twentieth reprint was made in 1820. Versions appeared in years including 1802, 1807, 1809, 1813, 1818, 1819, 1821, 1823, 1825, 1826, 1829, 1830, 1840, 1854 and many later years. The book remains in print, with more recent editions for example in 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2014. The book was also republished in editions of Paley's Collected Works. It has been translated into languages including French and Welsh. Topics of dispute The Scottish philosopher David Hume, portrayed here by Allan Ramsay in 1766, criticised arguments from design; he did not live to see Paley's book. =Philosophy= The Scottish philosopher David Hume (who died in 1776, before Paley assembled his arguments into Natural Theology) had criticised arguments from design on several grounds. Firstly, he rejected the making of an analogy between the world and a human artifact such as a watch, since these are so dissimilar that any analogy must be very weak and unreliable. Secondly, Hume argued that even if one accepted the analogy, it would not prove that the creator is infinite, good, or perfectly intelligent, nor that there would be only one creator god. After all, wrote Hume, \\"what shadow of an argument... can you produce from your hypothesis to prove the unity of the Deity? A great number of men join in building a house or ship, in rearing a city, in framing a commonwealth; why may not several deities combine in contriving and framing a world?\\" To counter the first argument, Paley strongly defended the analogy, emphasising complex mechanisms in living organisms seen as machines designed for purpose and contending that, in a sense \\"That an animal is a machine is neither correctly true nor wholly false\\". In replying to the second argument, Paley made a tactical retreat from traditional attributes of God to a more limited definition, in which unity went \\"no further than to a unity of counsel\\". It sufficed that God demonstrated plan, intelligence and foresight, had inconceivable power, and showed goodness through perceived design being beneficial in the clear majority of cases. =Evolutionary biology: Buffon and Erasmus Darwin= Early evolutionary ideas presented a new threat to the analogy between living organisms and designed object, as life differs in reproducing itself. In chapter XXIII Paley explicitly dismissed Buffon's concept of \\"organic molecules\\", then turned to an unattributed concept: \\"Another system, which has lately been brought forward, and with much ingenuity, is that of appetencies\\": the term and his description clearly refer to Erasmus Darwin's concept of transmutation of species, as set out in Zoonomia. Paley objected to it dispensing with \\"the necessity, in each particular case, of an intelligent, designing mind\\", and to it lacking evidence or observations of the process. More specifically, Darwin had adopted the common idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics, and Paley raised objections including the persistence of unused male nipples, and (discreetly put in Latin) the effect of circumcision not being inherited by generations of Jews. Throughout the book, Paley presented difficulties in examples or analogies that had been presented to support evolutionary explanations or the doctrine of \\"appetencies\\". He objected that Erasmus Darwin's concept could only explain adaptation directly relating to activity, and could not explain passive adaptation. Opinions on Paley's arguments =Contemporary reception= The Edinburgh Review of 1803 commented that The review agreed with Paley that \\"No thinking man, we conceive, can doubt that there are marks of design in the universe\\" and that either a single example like the eye would be conclusive, or no quantity of examples would be. Paley is praised for relying on \\"mechanical phenomena\\" rather than arguments about human intelligence. The bible commentator William Jenks described the book in 1838 as \\"a work highly celebrated for the justness of its reflections, and the benevolence, good sense, and piety which it breathes.\\" =Charles Darwin and evolutionary biology= In the late 1830s, Charles Darwin re-read Paley's book. Charles Darwin's studies at the University of Cambridge included two other texts by Paley, and in his final exams in January 1831 he did well in questions on these texts. He had to stay on until June, and read Paley's Natural Theology as well as John Herschel's Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy and Alexander von Humboldt's Personal Narrative: these books inspired \\"a burning zeal\\" to research natural history. After the Beagle voyage he began development of his theory of natural selection, and in 1838 opened a notebook listing \\"books to be read\\", including \\"Paley's Nat. Theology\\".Darwin C. R. 'Books to be read' and 'Books Read' notebook. (1838-1851) CUL-DAR119, 12v In 1859, on completing On the Origin of Species, he told a friend \\"I do not think I hardly ever admired a book more than Paley's Natural Theology: I could almost formerly have said it by heart.\\" He later stated in his autobiography that he was initially convinced by the argument: =Modern evolutionary biology= In 1993 the evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould compared Paley to Voltaire's Doctor Pangloss, the man who could argue any case (however hopeless). Gould is struck that Paley can claim that even the agonising pain of gallstones or gout could indicate the goodness of a loving God, with the justification that it felt so good when the pain stopped. Gould makes it clear he finds Paley's argument incorrect scientifically, but states that he respects it as a coherent and well-defended philosophy. Gould particularly respects Paley's method of identifying alternative possibilities and then systematically refuting them. Gould notes that Paley envisages a Lamarckist kind of evolution and rebuts it with the observation that men have not lost their nipples through disuse. However, Gould writes, Paley did not manage to think of one more alternative, natural selection, which has no purpose at all but just kills off whatever works less well in every generation. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins described himself as a neo-Paleyan in The Blind Watchmaker (1986), where he argued, following the evolutionary biologist and humanist Julian Huxley, that Paley's watch analogy fails to recognise the difference between the complexity of living organisms and that of inanimate objects. Living organisms can reproduce themselves, so they can change to become more complex from generation to generation. Inanimate objects such as watches are unable to pass on any changes, so they never become more complex unless a watchmaker redesigns them. The comparison breaks down, in Dawkins's view, because of this important distinction. =Creationism= Paley wrote decades before Darwin, was writing about the existence of God, and did not have anything to say about evolution. Some of the modern creationists have changed the conclusion of his arguments to be refutation of evolution. As such, they have been rejected by \\"virtually all biologists\\". Evolution has been widely accepted by scientists from Darwin onwards, and Darwin persuaded \\"most educated people\\" that processes such as evolution were governed by natural laws. This has not stopped creationists such as those in the Intelligent Design (ID) movement from continuing to use Paley's arguments: See also * Parson-naturalist References  * =Editions= * Natural Theology, Darwin online: 12th edition * Natural Theology, Archive.org: 1879 Sheldon edition External links * William Paley.com * Berkeley: Paley * University of Sussex: Enlightening Science: Natural Theology and Creationism * NCSE: William Paley, 1743‚Äì1805 * Lander University: William Paley, The Teleological Argument 1802 non-fiction books Arguments for the existence of God Evolutionary biology Philosophy of biology Religious philosophical literature ","title":"Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity"},{"id":"42572966","text":"Richard O‚ÄôRawe is a former IRA prisoner and author of Blanketmen.

It was released on July 5, 2014 in Japan. Plot The movie begins with Anna running around the house avoiding something. She then reaches a room and closes the door as the voice of the brother calling her. The door opens with the figure of her brother by the gap. The scene then changes back to the time the same boy listening to someone singing on the street. The boy then runs into the road and gets killed in the traffic accident. Anna is then seen placing flower by the place of accident and encounters Shun being bullied by Takuro and his friends. As the scene goes back to the terrified Anna in the room, it suddenly switches to the time where Anna spends her time with Shun playing the escape game Shun made by the riverbank. Anna notices the scar in Shun's hand and asks about it, which Shun avoids to answer. Anna then heads home as Shun stays a little longer to finish checking his game. Takuro then appears and bullies Shun. Anna is seen looking back as she walks home. Takuro and Shun walks to an empty house. Upon reaching the house, Mika and Takeshi already wait for them. Meanwhile, Hiroshi is collecting soil sample nearby goes to check the house and meet the group. The door suddenly swings open. Takuro enters the house with his stuff and the rest follows. Anna is seen following them and enters the house as well. As they all enter, the door is locked and cannot be reopened. A smashing noise is heard upstairs and Hiroshi goes up to check by himself. They all, except Shun, receive unknown calls simultaneously, but no one is speaking. It is shown that the signals are gone. Right after, something seems to pass them in the next room. Takeshi became paranoid and started running around the house to hide. Shun encounters Anna and they move together to find a way out, while Shun points out that he feels that he has seen that something before but can't remember. Takuro and Mika open the door to the basement and Takuro goes down while Mika waits upstairs. Hearing something, Mika checks on the room next door and notices an opening, where she looks directly into a very big eye. Terrified, Mika runs away and is found by Hiroshi. They both check around and find Takeshi hiding in a cupboard. Takeshi mumbles about Naoki's death and cut by Mika saying that he will be killed by Takuro as he talks about it again. Takeshi refuses to move, so Hiroshi suggests that he stays there and they will pick him up when they find the way out. As Hiroshi and Mika go out of the room, they meet up with Anna and Shun. Mika questions Anna's presence but Hiroshi diverts the questions. They then go together to check around the house. Meanwhile, Takeshi gets a phone call, but no response from the other end. He then hears Takuro calling him from outside the cupboard and opens the door as a big blue hand grabs his head. The group hears Takeshi's scream and come back to check on him. As they reach the room, they see the door open and Takeshi, bleeding, is thrown out. He asks for help before being dragged back and the door closes. As the group enters the room, they finds Takeshi's dismembered body. Anna and Hiroshi pressure Mika about Takuro's whereabouts and about Naoki, but Mika refuses to tell them and runs away, chased by Hiroshi. Anna confronts Shun who describes that this event is the same as the game he created. Mika goes back to Takuro and begs him to leave immediately, which he takes lightly. Mika then goes to Takuro and seemingly seduces him just to steal his keys for the house. Takuro ignores her and continues on with his work. Mika rushes to the main door but the key doesn't seem to work. As she hears noises, she goes to check and encounters the Blue Demon, which then kills Mika. With Shun's knowledge of the game, they continue on finding the keys and items to move forward inside the house. They eventually reach a room with a blood-stained piano. As they observe the piano, Mika is heard calling Shun through the door. Anna stops him from opening the door saying that Mika will not call him. Shun is puzzled as the door gets smashed and the Blue Demon is seen. The Blue Demon enters the room and the two flee. Shun goes to a room with chained drawers locked with number combinations. He manages to grab the handkerchief as the Blue Demon enters from another door. They run away to go back to the piano room. Shun says that they have to use the handkerchief to wipe off the blood for the combinations of a safe. As they outrun the Blue Demon, Anna is stunned upon seeing the remains of Mika. As they sit and calm themselves, Anna talks about her brother Naoki, the same boy who was killed in a traffic accident as mentioned in the beginning of the film. The accident was called suicide with the assumption to his inability to withstand bullying. Anna refers how Shun is similar to her brother. The door then opens as Hiroshi is seen standing on the door. They then go to the piano room, retrieve the code to get the key to eventually reach the basement. As they reach the basement, they find that it has been opened by Takuro. As they go down, Takuro strikes Hiroshi, rendering him unconscious. Anna confronts Takuro and believes that Takuro is responsible for killing her brother, which he lightly denies. As Anna begins mentioning Shun's name, he gets annoyed. Puzzled by the conversation, Shun reaches the box Takuro carried and opens it, revealing his own lifeless body inside. Shun then realizes how the group, except Anna, has been ignoring him the whole time, how Takeshi got so scared when Shun was with him (for Takeshi cannot see Shun), and why Anna said Mika will not call him, because he is already dead and cannot be seen by everyone, except Anna. He then flashbacks to the time Takuro bullied him in the riverbank. Takuro hit Shun in the head, killing him. It is then revealed that Takuro went to the empty house to hide Shun's body. Takuro then explained that Shun used Takuro's name in the game and got mad. Shun is terrified with the truth and finally disappears as Anna apologizes to him. Takuro plans on killing Anna since she knows too much, but suddenly gets caught by the Blue Demon and eaten offscreen. Anna wakes Hiroshi up and the two flee. The Blue Demon notices them and chases after them. Hiroshi, knowing that he can't move so easily and slows Anna down, insists on staying to buy Anna some time to escape. The Blue Demon stomps on him as it chases Anna. Anna finally reaches the same room she was in as in the beginning of the movie, but instead of his brother, Shun is calling her from the door. Anna, confused about what to do next, opens the door into the shining light, where she is greeted by Shun. The scene goes back to the river, as Shun asks Anna whether she is okay. Shun then explains about the dynamics of the game as Anna notices his scar and holds his hand, telling him to speak whatever troubles him to her, as she can't help her brother and hopes that the same thing will not happen to Shun. Shun replies by holding Anna's hand back, with the screen on the laptop says that they've cleared the game.

Work Joep Franssens studied piano in Groningen and composition in the Hague and Rotterdam with composer Louis Andriessen and Klaas de Vries respectively. Franssens is a representative of the post-serial generation of Dutch composers who use tonal means and an accessible idiom without neo-Romantic features, even if the pathos-laden, highly emotional nature of his music appears to contradict this endeavour. In his works, which consist of chamber music, choral and orchestral works, Franssens aims at a synthesis of monumentality and euphony and is initially guided by J.S. Bach and the work of Gy√∂rgy Ligeti such as Lontano and Atmosph√®res. Later a trend towards radical austerity become apparent under the influence of American minimalist music, East European mysticism (e.g. P√§rt) and the symphonic pop music of the 1970s such as Yes and Genesis, culminating in the static diatonicism of the ensemble work ‚ÄòDwaallicht‚Äô (1989) and the serene counterpoint of ‚ÄòSanctus‚Äô for orchestra (1996, rev. 1999). The instrumentation increasingly shows a preference for warm, luxuriant colours.1997 Sound, Johan Kolsteeg PhD, 'Key Notes' XXXI/I-1997, p. 20-23; Although Franssens' multifaceted musical style does not make it easy to classify him, he is often regarded as a representative of the so-called New Spirituality in the Netherlands.2015 Musical Religiosity, dr.

It was the second of five films featuring Fernandel as the Italian priest Don Camillo and his struggles with Giuseppe 'Peppone' Bottazzi, the Communist Mayor of their rural town. Plot Don Camillo is exiled to a remote and bleak mountain parish by his bishop at the request of Peppone, the Communist mayor of a small Po Valley town named Brescello. But the mayor develops problems with the citizens of the town, who want Camillo back as parish priest. In addition, a flood threatens to destroy Brescello and its environs. So Peppone calls back the priest, and he tries to raise the money needed to prevent damage from the imminent flood. However, delays occur and the flood devastates the area. Don Camillo insists on remaining in the town as the townspeople flee to safety, but the film ends on a heart-warming note as the sun breaks out heralding the end of the flood.

It was built in 1910 and donated to the Madras Parsi Zarthosti Anjuman by philanthropist Phiroj M. Clubwala. The temple is one of the 177 odd fire temples in the world, of which some 150 are in India. It is the only Parsi fire temple in Tamil Nadu and surrounding region, including Puducherry and Kerala. The flame in the temple is burning continuously ever since the temple was built and is stoked five times a day by the priest. History Although Parsis first arrived in Madras between 1795 and 1809, when a group of six Parsis and two priests from Coorg landed in the city and bought land at Royapuram opposite the Catholic Church, there was no official priest in the community for over 100 years till 1906, and there was no place of worship until the fire temple was built. From 1887, the Madras Parsi Panchayat started collecting monthly contributions from members in the region for a Mobed Fund, chiefly intended to maintain a mobed (priest) and to eventually establish a place of worship, for which a significant contribution was made by Sir Dinshaw Petit of Bombay in 1896. The community then purchased a plot of land in Royapuram, where the community by then had established itself to a significant extent. However, plans to build a temple in this plot were delayed. When Phiroj Muncherji Clubwala, a benefactor of the Parsi community in Madras, lost his 14-year-old son Jal in February 1906, he found it difficult to perform the prayers and rituals the Parsi way as there was no fire temple in the city. He soon created a corpus to enable the Parsi community in Madras to avail the services of a mobed. The first mobed was Ervad Dosabhai Pavri. In 1907, Clubwala decided to gift the Madras Parsi Zarthosti Anjuman (the successor of the Panchayat) a piece of land that he bought opposite his house on West Mada Church Street in Royapuram, after noting the slow progress of collections for the Mobed Fund and for a new fund that a committee of six was making efforts to swell. The new land was located near the site earmarked earlier. On 9 February 1909, the foundation stone for a fully equipped Agiari was laid by Hormusji Nowroji, a civil engineer and president of the Parsi Anjuman for almost 45 years, and an amount of 30,000 raised by the community was provided to maintain the temple. With the community raising the money in short order, Clubwala built the temple and the Anjuman named the temple after Clubwala's son. Nowroji also designed the temple and supervised its building. On 7 August 1910, the temple was consecrated as the Jal Phiroj Clubwala Dar-e-Meher. Dosabhai Pavri had retired shortly before the consecration, and Ervad Hormasji Adarji Gai was appointed the new priest. With the consecration of the new temple, he became its first pathank (priest-in-charge). Clubwala also donated the Anjuman a block of land adjacent to the temple and built an accommodation for the priests. Clubwala also built a block in the Anjuman Bagh and donated a large tract of land near his house to St. Kevin's Presentation Convent and School, a school for girls in North Madras. After Clubwala died in August 1927, the Phiroj Clubwala Memorial Hall was built to honour his memory, which was inaugurated by his widow Srinibai on 14 August 1930. The Parsi Club was also built in 1930 to honour Clubwala. The Parsis' ecclesiastical head in Madras, Ervad Peshotan Daji, affectionately called \\"Pesi\\", was associated with the fire temple for over 60 years. The fire temple was earlier managed by his grandfather (from 1913 to 1938) and later by his father (from 1938 to 1968). Peshotan Daji started as an assistant priest in 1924 at the age of 12 and continued to serve the community till 1983. During World War I, when the German warship SMS Emden bombed the Madras High Court premises, Royapuram was evacuated. Peshotan Daji, however, refused to leave the fire temple and stayed on alone to keep the fire burning. The temple Only Parsis and Zoroastrian Iranis are admitted into the sanctum sanctorum. The fire at the temple has never been extinguished since the construction of the temple. Priests tend to the fire five times a day during prayers. Centenary celebrations In July 2010, the Madras Parsi Association and the members of The Madras Parsi Zarthosti Anjuman jointly marked the centenary celebrations with a three-day function and a medley of rituals and entertainment with a performance by musician Gary Lawyer. The function was inaugurated by former president A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.

The first president was Geoffrey Burnstock. Elsewhere, it has been claimed that the society originated because of the Journal of Autonomic Neuroscience, presumably because discussions amongst the early editors identified lack of scientific exchange, at an international level, amongst researchers in the field.

White of Fleet Street, London in 1802. It was one of the texts, along with Thomas Bewick's contemporaneous A History of British Birds (2 volumes, 1797 and 1804) that made ornithology popular in Britain, and, with the 1676 Ornithologia libri tres of Francis Willughby and John Ray, helped to make it the object of serious study. The book includes a description of the cirl bunting, discovered by Montagu in 1800 near his home in Kingsbridge, Devon.Cocker and Mabey, 2005. pp. 462‚Äì463 The first edition was admired by biologists including Charles Darwin and David Lack. A second edition, extensively revised by James Rennie in 1831, was panned by scientific critics. Context The Ornithological Dictionary is George Montagu's best-known work, and the one that established his reputation as a pioneer of British ornithology.Moss, 2005. pp. 18‚Äì19Mearns, 1988. He compiled the book at his home Knowle House, near Kingsbridge in Devon. It was published soon after the first volume of Thomas Bewick's illustrated handbook, A History of British Birds, which appeared in 1797. It does not describe what is now called Montagu's harrier, which he separated from the hen harrier in 1803, after the publication of the book. Outline Frontispiece of 1802 edition of the Ornithological Dictionary, showing a cirl bunting. Montagu discovered the species near his home in Devon. =Introduction= George Montagu's introduction, \\"in hopes of advancing knowledge of the subject\\",Montagu, 1802. p. i mentions Thomas Pennant as being \\"diffuse on the subject\\" of ornithology, as well as Dr. Latham's General Synopsis of Birds and his Index Ornithologicus.Montagu, 1802. p. ii He then introduces the anatomy of birds, separating those with a cartilaginous stomach or gizzard, and those with a membranous stomach; those that incubate their young, and the cuckoo that does not; with remarks on instincts such as carrying shell fragments away from the nest, birdsong, and feet adapted for different purposes, such as climbing or swimming.Montagu, 1802. pp. iii‚Äìxl Montagu states that the \\"sheets have been entirely drawn from our own observations, and compiled from the notes of twenty years search and attention ... in most parts of this kingdom\\", mentioning woods, mountains and \\"barren waste\\", rivers and lakes.Montagu, 1802. p. xli =Body= The start of the Ornithological Dictionary's article on the cirl bunting The entire body of the book is arranged as a dictionary from Aberdevine ('Vide Siskin'.) on page 58 (the pages are however not numbered in the original) to Yelper ('Vide Avoset'.) on page 687. Since the book does not have a continuous narrative to summarise, the account here will use one species as a running example to illustrate the book's approach. The cirl bunting is chosen because it was discovered by Montagu and is associated in Britain with his home town of Kingsbridge, Devon. He also chose the species for the colour frontispiece of the book. The entry for the cirl bunting states that it was discovered by Montagu \\"in the winter of 1800\\"Montagu, 1802. pp. 80‚Äì82 near his home in Kingsbridge, Devon. He records that the species is indigenous to Devon and \\"confined to the southern parts of that county contiguous to the coast\\", as it remains in the twentyfirst century. Species are listed by the English form of the generic name, thus BUNTING-CIRL. Each genus thus named is listed, as Entry structure The entry for each species varies in length from half a page, as for BUNTING-GREEN-HEADED (which is dismissed as \\"no other than an accidental variety of the female Yellow Bunting\\")Montagu, 1802. pp. 83‚Äì84 to three pages (as for BUNTING-CIRL). The cirl bunting entry begins by citing the known authorities on the species, with the names they used for it: The rest of the entry is written in continuous prose, starting with a physical description giving length, weight, and a detailed account of plumage with differences between the sexes (more than a page in the cirl bunting's case). Montagu then describes the species' distribution, nesting (nest structure, number of eggs, nesting period), differences from similar species, and other observations. =Appendices= The appendix lists two additional species of sandpiper (the little and the yellow- legged).Montagu, 1802. pp. 686‚Äì687 There follows 'A List of British Birds, systematically arranged into Ordines, Genera and Species', divided as in Thomas Bewick's A History of British Birds into Land Birds and Water Birds.Montagu, 1802. pp. 688‚Äì704 Montagu then provides an \\"Explanation of some Technical Terms used in Ornithology by Linnaeus and others, and in this Work\\".Montagu, 1802. pp. 704‚Äì707 Terms range from the Cere, \\"the naked skin that covers the base of the bill in the Hawk kind\\" to \\"Pes compedes\\", \\"When the legs are placed so far behind as to be rendered almost useless in walking, as in the Grebes and Divers\\". This is followed by a \\"Catalogue of the Principal Authors referred to in this Work\\". The authors range from Eleazar Albin to Francis Willughby.Montagu, 1802. pp. 709‚Äì711 Editions The first edition appeared in 1802. It had page numbers in the introduction (to page xlii (42 pages) but not in the main text (655 pages). It was printed in two volumes for J. White of Fleet Street, London by T. Bensley of Bolt Court, London.Montagu, 1802. Title page. A Supplement to the Ornithological dictionary, or, Synopsis of British birds was published in Exeter by S. Woolmer in 1813. The second edition appeared in 1831, described as being \\"By Colonel G. Montagu, F.L.S.\\" but \\"with a plan of study, and many new articles and original observations\\".Montagu and Rennie, 1831. Title page. It was fully numbered and ran to lx (60 pages of introductory matter) + 592 pages. The text was revised by the Scottish naturalist James Rennie, Montagu having died in 1815. Rennie was not an ornithologist; he had earlier published books such as Insect Architecture and Insect Transformations. The second edition was published by Hurst, Chance, and Co, of St Paul's, London. Rennie states that he has \\"made very considerable alterations in the arrangement\\". He criticises Montagu's grouping of all species of a genus together, as with \\"Duck-Eider, Duck-King\\" as \\"an unnecessary awkwardness, attended with no apparent advantage\\", and instead lists them as written. He also criticises the use of \\"greater\\" and \\"lesser\\" to distinguish two similar species, as of whitethroats, choosing to call the lesser whitethroat by \\"the continental name, Babillard.\\"Montagu and Rennie, 1831. pp. v‚Äìvi Reception Montagu's book was considered the first major advance in British ornithology since Francis Willughby and John Ray's 1676 Ornithologia libri tres. =Contemporary: first edition= The 1829 Magazine of Natural History commented that \\"Montagu's Ornithological Dictionary and Bewick's Birds .. have rendered [the] department of natural history popular throughout the land [of Britain]\\". The botanist John Templeton is recorded in the Dictionary of National Biography to have made marginal notes in his copy of Montagu. =Contemporary: second edition= In 1831, \\"J. D.\\" wrote to The Magazine of Natural History, and Journal of Zoology, Botany, Mineralogy, Geology, and Meteorology about James Rennie's second edition \\"to point out a few of its faults\\". He argued that the \\"Plan of study\\" which Rennie had added to the book was impractical, imagining the reader to have a shelf of books instead, probably, of just the one. Next, \\"J. D.\\" attacked Rennie's \\"use of system\\", declaring himself disappointed, especially by Rennie's \\"abuse\\" of zoologists who were systematic. He then asks rhetorically whether anyone can identify a bird using the second edition, answering his own question with \\"that he can do so, no one will, I think, have the hardihood to advance\\" and hence that \\"The book, viewed in this light, appears to be a complete failure.\\" \\"J. D.\\" then gives a series of quotations to illustrate Rennie's erroneous additions, with the words \\"we leave the work to its merits\\". Also in 1831, the ornithologist William John Swainson wrote a hostile review of Rennie's edition for the Philosophical Magazine, commenting that > we were struck with the extreme assumption and arrogance of the whole style > of treating his subject, which is here displayed by the author [Rennie]; > with the bitterness and contempt of his vituperation of the naturalists > whose views he condemns, disingenuously mingled with praise, which on his > own showing must be undeserved; and with the perverse ignorance from which > alone such misrepresentations as he makes on all the subjects which he > touches, could have arisen. Swainson further condemns Rennie's objections to the short-lived Quinarian system of classification, which Swainson supported. The book received similar treatment at the hands of the Eclectic and Congregational Review. The book had some very careful readers; the ornithologist Alfred Newton noticed that Rennie had used an identical paragraph to describe two birds, the beam bird (now called the spotted flycatcher) and the pied flycatcher, though their descriptions were separated by 300 pages. =Later commentaries= Charles Darwin quoted from Montagu's account of the role of birdsong in his 1871 Selection in Relation to Sex, commenting that \\"Few more careful observers ever lived\\". W. H. Mullens, in a 1908 issue of British Birds, argued that despite the contributions of Thomas Pennant, of Gilbert White's Natural History of Selborne (1789), and Thomas Bewick's fine wood engravings in A History of British Birds (1797‚Äì1804), ornithology had not made much progress since the seventeenth century. Instead, The ornithologist and ethologist David Lack, writing in 1944, praises the book as \\"a necessary corrective to the ornate and often inaccurate works of the late eighteenth century\\", adding that Montagu's views on pair formation in songbirds, and the role of birdsong \\"are remarkably up-to-date.\\" Lack mentions Montagu's observations of a male bird's decline in song once it had found a mate, and Montagu's experiments showing that full song returned when a male redstart's mate was removed. Lack further wrote that Stephen Moss evaluates Montagu's contribution as \\"of vital importance\\" to the growth of birdwatching, writing in 2005 thatMoss, 2005. p. 19 Moss observes that Montagu cleared up many \\"misapprehensions and errors\\", enabling later ornithologists especially William MacGillivray and William Yarrell to write their \\"seminal avifaunas\\" early in the Victorian era. Mark Cocker and Richard Mabey in their Birds Britannica note that Montagu took the association of the distribution and lifestyle of the stone curlew and the great bustard to mean that they were closely related.Cocker and Mabey, 2005. p. 194 Montagu indeed names the stone curlew the \\"Thick-kneed Bustard\\".Montagu, 1802. pp. 97‚Äì98 Notes References Sources =Primary= * Montagu, George (1802).

A quasimodular form is the holomorphic part of an almost holomorphic modular form. An almost holomorphic modular form is determined by its holomorphic part, so the operation of taking the holomorphic part gives an isomorphism between the spaces of almost holomorphic modular forms and quasimodular forms. The archetypal examples of quasimodular forms are the Eisenstein series E2(œÑ) (the holomorphic part of the almost holomorphic modular form E2(œÑ) ‚Äì 3/œÄIm(œÑ)), and derivatives of modular forms. In terms of representation theory, modular forms correspond roughly to highest weight vectors of certain discrete series representations of SL2(R), while almost holomorphic or quasimodular forms correspond roughly to other (not necessarily highest weight) vectors of these representations. Definitions To simplify notation this section treats the level 1 case; the extension to higher levels is straightforward. A level 1 almost holomorphic modular form is a function f on the upper half plane with the properties: *f transforms like a modular form: f((a\\\\tau+b)/(c\\\\tau+d)) = (c\\\\tau+d)^kf(\\\\tau) for some integer k called the weight, for any elements of SL2(Z) (that is: a, b, c, d are integers with ad - bc = 1). *As a function of q=e2œÄiœÑ, f is a polynomial in 1/Im(œÑ) with coefficients that are holomorphic functions of q. A level 1 quasimodular form is defined to be the constant term of an almost holomorphic modular form (considered as a polynomial in 1/Im(œÑ)). Structure The ring of almost holomorphic modular forms of level 1 is a polynomial ring over the complex numbers in the three generators E_2(\\\\tau)-3/\\\\pi\\\\Im(\\\\tau), E_4(\\\\tau), E_6(\\\\tau). Similarly the ring of quasimodular forms of level 1 is a polynomial ring over the complex numbers in the three generators E_2(\\\\tau), E_4(\\\\tau), E_6(\\\\tau). Quasimodular forms can be interpreted as sections of certain jet bundles. Derivatives Ramanujan observed that the derivative of any quasimodular form is another quasimodular form.* For example, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\frac{dE_2}{d\\\\tau} & = \\\\frac{E_2^2-E_4}{12} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\frac{dE_4}{d\\\\tau} & = \\\\frac{E_2E_4-E_6}{3} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\frac{dE_6}{d\\\\tau} & = \\\\frac{E_2E_6-E_4^2}{2} \\\\end{align} As the field generated by quasimodular forms of some level has transcendence degree 3 over C, this implies that any quasimodular form satisfies some nonlinear differential equation of order 3\\\\. For example, the Eisenstein series E2 satisfies the Chazy equation (give or take a few constants).

He received his Masters of Arts from Trinity College, Dublin and was a professor at Selly Oaks College. Robinson advocated many of the ecumenical implications of the work of Thomas Campbell's Declaration and Address in his works such as What the Churches of Christ Stand For and his Essays on Christian Unity. He was an active member of various ecumenical efforts in the middle of the 20th century such as the Faith and Order Movement and the World Council of Churches. He rejected the idea that the New Testament has an ahistorical law code for the church to replicate and placed greater importance on the development of the church through history as an essential part of organic unity of the church. He held to a sacramental view of Baptism and the Eucharist (communion), rejecting the Zwinglian views held by some earlier preachers and theologians in the movement. Robinson believed that unity was not simply organization coherence, but a connection to the singular people of God through the history of the church. Because Robinson believed that this unity meant a connection to the historical church and because of his sacramental views on the church and Christian worship, Robinson is seen as a theologian that represents the free church/high church position, or what many have called \\"free church catholicism.\\" His book, The Biblical Doctrine of the Church, articulates his ecclesiology and his understanding of Christian unity. He writes from within the framework purposed by Thomas Campbell, but with an increased emphasis on the church as the embodied (or incarnational) work of God in history.

The park, which opened on June 29, 2016, is located above the World Trade Center's Vehicular Security Center. The St. Nicholas National Shrine is located within the park, as well as The Sphere, the iconic sculpture salvaged from the World Trade Center site. Another statue, America's Response Monument, is also located in the park. History Construction began in 2013 when the Vehicular Security Center was completed. Liberty Park is located on top of the Vehicular Security Center, the latter of which protects the site against unauthorized vehicles. The parking facility is linked to the concourse area, which feeds the entire 16-acre World Trade Center site. About $50 million was allocated to the park's construction by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in December 2013. The park opened on June 29, 2016. On August 16, 2017, the Port Authority installed The Sphere within the park, overlooking its original location. Description The sapling from the Anne Frank tree The park has a capacity of 750 people and is the roof of the Vehicular Security Center. A \\"living wall\\", measuring long and tall, is located on the park's northern facade adjoining Liberty Street. It contains 826 panels, upon which are attached \\"periwinkle, Japanese spurge, winter creeper, sedge and Baltic ivy\\", A walkway from the pedestrian bridge curves along the park. Egresses include three stairways, the pedestrian bridge, and a straight ramp down to Greenwich Street. One of these stairs, a wide staircase is located on the east side of the park, between Greenwich Street to the east and the back of the church to the west. There are wood benches and a small amphitheater-like elevated space at the western end of the park, facing West Street. Finally, there is a \\"continuous overlook\\" along much of Liberty Street in addition to \\"a gently curving balcony\\" at the church's foot. A sapling from the Anne Frank tree is located alongside the ramp at the southeastern corner of Liberty Park. 5 World Trade Center was originally planned to be built adjacent to the southern edge of the Vehicular Security Center and Liberty Park on the site of the former Deutsche Bank Building. , the Port Authority does not plan to proceed with construction of a mixed-use skyscraper on the site until the rest of the complex is complete, which will be no earlier than 2021. The park overlooks the National September 11 Memorial & Museum and has a connection to the Liberty Street Bridge. The St. Nicholas Church, destroyed in the September 11 attacks, is being rebuilt in the park, with a new design by Santiago Calatrava, who also designed the Transportation Hub. The park, located above Liberty Street, is just a little more than in area. =Location of The Sphere= The Sphere, November 2017 The Sphere, a large cast bronze sculpture by German artist Fritz Koenig, had stood in Austin J. Tobin Plaza between the World Trade Center towers in Manhattan. Recovered from the rubble after the September 11 attacks in 2001, intact but visibly damaged, The Sphere faced an uncertain future and was dismantled and stored. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), which owns The Sphere, considered placing the sculpture in Liberty Park, which will be located between the 90 West Street building and the World Trade Center Memorial site. Construction on Liberty Park did not start until 2013, so a location was needed to place The Sphere until Liberty Park was completed. , PANYNJ had not made an official final decision on where to place the sculpture once Battery Park construction commences, forcing the sculpture to move. Until Liberty Park opened, The Sphere was to go into storage. When Liberty Park opened in June 2016, the question had not been resolved. On July 22, 2016, the Port Authority voted to move the sculpture to Liberty Park, and in August 2017, PANYNJ relocated the sculpture to Liberty Park. On September 6, 2017, the Sphere was unveiled in its permanent home in Liberty Park, overlooking the World Trade Center site. =Horse Soldier sculpture= America's Response Monument The America's Response Monument, a life-and-a-half scale bronze statue commemorating the actions of U.S. Special Operations Forces in the first few weeks of the War in Afghanistan, was unveiled to the public during the Veteran's Day Parade in New York City on November 11, 2011. The statue was dedicated in a ceremony led by Vice President Joe Biden and Lieutenant-General John Mulholland, commander of U.S. Army Special Operations Command and formerly commander of Task Force Dagger during the initial days of the War in Afghanistan. Soldiers representing the United States Army Special Operations Command attended the dedication ceremony. The inscription at base of the sculpture bears its name, America's Response Monument, and the Latin subtitle De Oppresso Liber. The subtitle, traditionally translated as \\"to free the oppressed\\", is the motto of the Green Berets, who inspired the monument. A piece of steel from the original World Trade Center is embedded in the base. It is the first public monument to honor United States special forces. The $750,000 cost of statue was donated by hundreds of private citizens, including some survivors of the September 11 attacks. The statue was temporarily located in the West Street Lobby inside One World Financial Center in New York City opposite Ground Zero. On September 13, 2016, the statue was rededicated once again on an elevated space on the south side of Ground Zero within Liberty Park. =St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church= The St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church seen in September 2018 On July 23, 2008, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reached a deal with the leaders of the St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church for the Port Authority to acquire the lot that the church had occupied, for $20 million, $10 million of which is coming from the Port Authority and the other $10 million of which is coming from JPMorgan Chase. In addition, the Port Authority was willing to pay up to $40 million to construct a bomb-proof platform underneath. In March 2009, the Port Authority stated it quit talking with the church and canceled building St. Nicholas altogether. The Port Authority claimed that the church was asking for too much, and that they might delay the whole World Trade Center project. The Archdioceses says that they just wanted the church back, and a third of the building would be a memorial for 9/11, and a place where people of all faiths could pray and remember those who died in the attacks. Architect Santiago Calatrava was awarded the task of designing the new St. Nicholas. His plans drew inspiration from the great Byzantine churches of Hagia Sophia and the Church of the Holy Savior in Chora, both in Istanbul. The church will be constructed in Liberty Park; the site for the new church is east of the original site at 155 Cedar Street. , construction of the new church was scheduled to begin in early 2014, and to end in late 2017. The new church will be created from steel and concrete but the exterior will be clad in stone. The interior design of the church is still being determined. Construction of the new church began in early 2014, and after numerous delays, is expected to be complete in 2021.See:  * References External links * Aftermath of the September 11 attacks Elevated parks Parks in Manhattan West Side Highway World Trade Center ","title":"Liberty Park"},{"id":"42573908","text":"Henry Stanley \\"Harry\\" Smith (11 October 1908 ‚Äì 1993) was an English footballer who made 225 appearances in the Football League, playing for Nottingham Forest and Darlington before the Second World War and briefly for Bristol Rovers thereafter.

Divine had been a war correspondent and after the Second World War became the defence correspondent of the British Sunday Times, a post he held until 1975.  Early career  Born in Cape Town on 27 July 1904, the son of Arthur Henry Divine and his wife, Mabel Frances Durham, he was educated at Rondebosch Boys' High School and Kingswood College, Grahamstown.Information supplied by family members. He was employed as a journalist on the Cape Times between 1922‚Äì1926 and again between 1931‚Äì1935. In 1930 he commenced his career as an author of adventure stories, thrillers, military politics and history books.[Mr David Divine, Obituary, Times, 2 May 1987, p.72.] Some were written under the pen name 'David Rame'. His first novel as Rame was Wine of Good Hope (1939).

Divine would write the screenplay for the feature film Dunkirk (1958) and was the likely inspiration for central character Charles Foreman (Bernard Lee), skipper of the motorboat Vanity. Like Divine, he is wounded during the operation but Foreman dies from his wounds. Nine Days at Dunkirk was a factual account of the operation first published in 1945. In this he exposed the legend that the evacuation was carried out by the spontaneous and uncoordinated actions of the little ships when in fact they had been carried out as 'part of a highly organised movement' by the Admiralty. He was also highly critical of General Alan Brooke's (later Lord Alanbrooke) actions preceding the operation but very sympathetic to Lord Gort, commander of the BEF.\\"In Which They Served.\\" Times [London, England] 16 April 1959: 15.

To be selected as a correspondent aboard a British warship at this time was a considerable achievement in itself as the Royal Navy was suspicious of journalists and refused to allow any aboard at the beginning of the war.P Knightley, The First Casualty is Truth: The War Correspondent as Hero and Myth-Maker from the Crimea to Kosovo (Prion Books, 2001), p.244. Many of his observations were incorporated into Destroyers‚Äô War: A Million Miles by the Eighth Flotilla (1943). He was also present during Operation Torch ‚Äì the American landings in North Africa in 1943, and travelled over the Atlas Mountains with the first US troops to fight the German army in the Second World War. At D-Day (Operation Overlord) he accompanied the first flotilla of tank landing craft. The final phase of the war was spent with the American Pacific Fleet in the last battles against Japan. Despite his work as a correspondent he still found time to write The Sun Shall Greet Them, (1941), Tunnel from Calais (1943), and Road to Tunis, (1944). After the war, he received the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in recognition of his service during the conflict.Obituary, p.72  Criticism of British defence  Working for the Sunday Times foreign news service under former naval intelligence officer (and later creator of James Bond), Ian Fleming, Divine travelled widely. He claimed to be the only journalist to charge expenses for an aeroplane and a camel on the same claim form. As newspapers published longer articles and features, Divine made his reputation as the Sunday Times defence correspondent, where he wrote extensively about Britain's defences in the age of the nuclear missile.Obituary, p.72 He subjected Britain's defence establishment to withering fire in The Blunted Sword (1964) for a lack of imagination and for missing countless opportunities since the Royal Navy began its transition from sail to steam. He was particularly critical of the services' \\"fortress mentality\\" in fiercely defending their individual vested interests. Divine recommended maximum decentralisation to the commands and a return of the function of weapons production to industry, to competitive development and to new ideas untrammelled by bureaucracy and tradition. This was contrary to the government's efforts to push British aircraft firms and other defence industries into a succession of mergers that would finally become British Aerospace plc and to create a unified Ministry of Defence (MOD). The MOD, he argued, would not resolve the problems of inter-service rivalry as they would merely \\"fight in different ways for their separate powers\\".Divine, The Blunted Sword (Hutchinson, 1964), cover synopsis. A naval reviewer acknowledged Divine's painstaking factual accuracy but accused him of seeing only one side of the question and failing to properly appreciate the difficulties faced in the past.RH, \\"Review of The Blunted Sword\\", The Naval Review, Vol. LII No- 3, 31 July 1964. Criticism of Divine on the grounds of his lack of objectivity would be unfair, claimed a Times reviewer, pointing out that his preface made clear it was an attack upon the service administration rather than the services themselves. It was not the sort of book to draw much praise from scholarly historians but was nevertheless \\"effective\\" with \\"something of value to say about Britain's power to influence the policies of the west\\".\\"Warriors in Whitehall\\", Times, 19 March 1964, p.17. Divine produced a wider ranging attack on the air force establishment from World War I up to the mid-1960s in The Broken Wing (1966). He claimed that all three of the British armed services were slow to appreciate the missile's potential despite the damage inflicted to Britain by Germany's V1 cruise missiles and V2 rockets toward the end of the Second World War. He criticized the RAF for clinging to the manned bomber when the United States was relegating the United States Air Force's (USAF) Strategic Air Command's (SAC) bomber force to a subsidiary role.Divine, The Broken Wing: A Study in the British Exercise of Air Power (Hutchinson, 1966), pp. 9‚Äì15. This was because the Soviet air defences had demonstrated their effectiveness against manned aircraft by shooting down the high-altitude Lockheed U-2 spy-plane piloted by Gary Powers with a surface-to-air guided missile.Divine, Broken Wing, p.325 The US then unintentionally frustrated the British bomber lobby's plans by cancelling its GAM-87 Skybolt project‚Äìa planned stand-off missile that had just been ordered for the V bomber fleet. The US then concentrated on the development of Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs).Divine, Broken Wing, pp. 342‚Äì343. Improvements in Soviet Intermediate Range (IRBM) and stand- off missiles also indicated that Britain was defenceless against a missile strike during the mid-1960s, because a potential counter-strike against the Soviet Union with sub-sonic V bombers seemed doomed to failure given the improvements to the Soviet air defences and the fact that the V bomber bases were themselves vulnerable to IRBM's and stand-off missilery.Divine, Broken Wing, pp. 317‚Äì318 The attempt to prolong the life of the V bomber force by converting the aircraft from high level to low level attack and using a stop- gap stand-off missile was also seen as futile owing to the advances made in the field of Soviet non-radar low-level air defence and the inherent limitations of British equipment originally designed for use at high altitudes. \\"Britain stood naked in a missile-armed world\\", he wrote.Divine, Broken Wing, pp. 347, 375‚Äì76. Other writings But Divine also wrote on a wide array of subjects. The North-West Frontier of Rome re-told the story of Hadrian's Wall and a children's book The Three Red Flares (1970) may have been the first book produced that used computer technology for mass- publishing.Obituary, p.72. Boy on a Dolphin (1955), set in Greece would become a major 20th Century Fox film starring Sophia Loren and Alan Ladd. The book tells the romantic story of Phaedra, an island sponge-diver who discovers an ancient statue of a boy riding upon a dolphin. The statue then becomes the object of a struggle between an archaeologist (Ladd) who wants Phaedra (Loren) to sell it to the Greek authorities and a millionaire who desires it for his private collection.OUR CORRESPONDENT. \\"American Film Made in Greece.\\" Times [London, England] 27 November 1956: 3.

His writing on defence issues was a notable influence on Wing Cmdr Hubert Allen's controversial books and articles on British airpower, especially Who Won the Battle of Britain and The Legacy of Lord Trenchard. Allen claimed that Divine was the 'notable exception' to the Fleet Street defence correspondents, who 'almost to a man' swallowed the notion of the V bomber's low-level capability.H R Allen, The Legacy of Lord Trenchard (Cassell, 1972), p.191.

(previously known as Edward Durell Stone, Jr., and Associates) is a planning, landscape architecture, and urban design firm founded in 1960.http://www.edsaplan.com/files/media-download/press_room/edsa- edsa-fact-sheet-2145.pdf The company is headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida with offices in Orlando, Florida; Manhattan, New York; Baltimore, Maryland; and Shanghai, China. There are 120 employees who represent EDSA and come from a varied range of cultural and ethnic distinctiveness with origins from more than 25 different countries. In addition, their portfolio spans a global range of more than 500 projects in over 100 countries. The firm has been referred to as one of the leading landscape architecture companies in the world. EDSA also considers itself a steward of the land, according to the website, and places sustainability at the forefront of its planning and design efforts. EDSA services include: Master Planning (Site selection and site analysis, land use planning, feasibility studies, visioning workshops, development strategies, site-specific plans, design guidelines and entitlements), Landscape Architecture (Site design and theming, conceptual and schematic design, design development, hardscape and water features, planting design and construction period services), and Urban Design (Downtown planning, city revitalization and redevelopment, urban open space, transit-oriented design, public consensus building and vision plans).  History  EDSA was founded in 1960 by American landscape architect Edward Durell Stone, Jr., who collaborated with his father, architect Edward Durell Stone, Sr. to found EDSA. Stone, Jr. died in 2009 and Douglas C. Smith, who joined the firm in 1987, now serves as president of the company.Edward Durell Stone, Jr. In the 1960s, EDSA became an instrumental player in the travel and tourism industries, leading resort and recreation assignments primarily in the Caribbean, Latin America, and the Southeastern United States. During this time, EDSA adopted an environmentally-based design philosophy, which was a relatively obscure notion that takes inspiration from each project's local heritage. A village center form became the framework for housing, amenities, and commerce in order to conserve resources and foster social diversity. This approach became a hallmark of EDSA resorts and communities. In 1971, EDSA began to receive national recognition when Stone, Jr. was appointed to the Commission of Fine Arts in Washington, D.C. by President Richard Nixon. He served in the position for 12 years. Simultaneously, EDSA's reach was growing on an international level as the firm expanded within the global marketplace. Assignments in the Middle East, Europe, and South America further imbedded the values of sensitivity to local cultures and the importance of collaboration with local professionals. EDSA broadened its urban design practice with two influential public commissions that reinvigorated Fort Lauderdale's neglected urban waterfronts: The Fort Lauderdale Beach Revitalization in 1986 and Riverwalk Linear Park which was completed in 1994. In the 1990s, EDSA embarked on planning for several academic institutions including the College of Staten Island and Nova Southeastern University as well as cultural venues like the Florida Nature Cultural Center. A branch office in Orlando began to thrive with several assignments for the Disney Corporation and the new Orlando International Airport. In 1994, Joseph Lalli became President of EDSA. Under his leadership, EDSA Orient became the first joint venture landscape architectural office in Beijing, China. He took the role of Chairman from 2012 until 2014, when he died. Currently, J. Robert Behling holds the role of Chairman.

Ras Woldemichael was born into the Hazega clan of the wider Tigrinya ethnic group , the eldest son of Abeto Solomon Zerai of Hazega and Woizero Eleni. Today he is widely celebrated as a hero standing for Eritrean sovereignty. Life Ras Woldemichael was born into one of the traditional ruling families of Medri Bahri, the House of Hazega. Upon the death of Emperor Tewodros II in 1868, then ruler of Tigray (and later Emperor), Dejazmatch Yohannes IV appointed his ally Woldemichael the Governor of Hamasien and Seraye. In doing so, Tewodros' former appointee Dejazmatch Hailu Teweldemedhin of the rival House of Tsazega was replaced. Under the leadership of now Emperor Yohannes IV, Woldemichael fought in the Battle of Gundet against Egyptian forces under Khedive Isma'il Pasha, who sought to bring the entire Nile River Basin under his rule. The Khedive entrusted the Danish mercenary Colonel Adolf Arendrup to annex Hamasien and Seraye, and then proceed towards Adwa. Following some minor skirmishes, the forces of the Khedive met the Abyssinian forces at Gundet on the morning of 16 November 1875. Ras Alula took command of the left flank, the forces of Yohannes on the right, with Woldemichael taking command of the center and rear in light of his greater knowledge of the area. The Egyptians were tricked into a narrow and steep valley and were wiped out by the Abyssinian gunners surrounding the valley from the surrounding mountains. Virtually the entire Egyptian force, along with its many officers of European and North American background were killed. News of this huge defeat was suppressed in Egypt for fear that it would undermine the government of the Khedive. However, Woldemichael resented the nature of the Emperor's interference in the semi- autonomous Medri Bahri and feared that Yohannes intended to re-appoint Woldemichael's rival Hailu as Governor. Before the Battle of Gura ensued, he rebelled against Yohannes and sided with the Egyptians. Following the defeat of the Egyptians at Gura, Woldemichael went into open revolt against Yohannes, vowing to destroy his rival Hailu in the process, culminating in the defeat of Hailu during the Battle of Weki Duba. Unable to consolidate power in the northern provinces, Yohannes sent messengers to Woldemichael offering to forgive his past crimes if he submitted to him. Woldemichael adamantly refused, leading to Yohannes' appointment of loyalist Ras Baryaw Gebretsadiq as Governor of Hamasien. Ras Baryaw's governorship was however shortlived, with Woldemichael confronting and soundly defeating him at Biet Mekae near Asmara. Yohannes then appointed Ras Alula as Governor, tasking him to end Woldemichael's revolt. When Ras Alula became aware of the difficulties fighting Woldemichael, once again a truce was offered to Woldemichael, with Ras Alula swearing on The Bible that he would not attack. On this occasion, Woldemichael agreed to peace terms and travelled to Axum, Ethiopia to sign a peace treaty. However, Alula broke his promise and imprisoned Ras Woldemichael, allowing Alula to rule Hamasien with little opposition afterwards. Woldemichael lived in forced retirement in Axum until his death in 1906.

He was one of the first men to vault 14 feet (4.26 m) and was NCAA champion in 1928 and 1929. After graduating from Stanford University he started working for the Bank of Italy, but died from polio aged 22. Biography Edmonds was born in San Diego, California on July 3, 1908, the son of Warner Edmonds, a wealthy banker, and Martha Edmonds (n√©e Ward). He attended Stanford University, where he was coached by Dink Templeton. At the 1927 IC4A championships he cleared 13 ft 6 in (4.11 m), placing third as Stanford won the team title; Yale's Sabin Carr broke the world record and became the first man to vault 14 ft (4.26 m), while 1924 Olympic champion Lee Barnes cleared 13 ft in (4.20 m) for second. The following week Edmonds placed second to Barnes at the Pacific Coast Conference championships, helping Stanford beat Barnes's University of Southern California for that team title by two points. At the 1928 West Coast Relays in Fresno Barnes and Edmonds became the second and third vaulters in the world to clear 14 ft (4.26 m), equaling Carr's outdoor world record. Barnes then cleared the next height, 14 ft in (4.31 m), on his third and final attempt to break the record; Edmonds also had good attempts at the record height, but was not successful. There were originally some doubts about the legitimacy of these marks; Barnes's jump (revised down to 14 ft in / 4.30 m) was rejected as a record in 1928 because the pegs had been the wrong length, but in 1929 it was officially approved. Edmonds won the 1928 NCAA championship, jumping a meeting record 13 ft in (4.13 m) and defeating the previous year's champion, Northwestern's Bill Droegemueller. He was heavily favored to qualify for the American Olympic team, but at the Olympic Trials in Cambridge he failed to clear 13 ft 6 in (4.11 m) and the four Olympic spots went to Carr, Barnes, Droegemueller and Charles McGinnis. In 1929, his final year at Stanford, Edmonds shared first place at the IC4A championships, clearing 13 ft 9 in (4.19 m). He also repeated as NCAA champion, improving his own meeting record to 13 ft in (4.18 m) and sharing first place with Tom Warne. In addition to pole vaulting, Edmonds took up the hurdles in 1929, defeating his Stanford teammate and 1928 IC4A hurdles champion Ross Nichols in several trial races. He was also captain of the Stanford golf team. After graduating Edmonds started working for the Bank of Italy while continuing his athletic career, but he contracted polio and died in the Stanford University Hospital in San Francisco on October 26, 1930, aged 22.

Its main aim is to provide quick and effective support for people in life-threatening situations by meeting their vital needs: water, food and shelter. The organization also has a particular focus on unsafe drinking water and food insecurity among the most vulnerable populations. Solidarit√©s International, an organization founded in 1980 by Alain Boinet under France's 1901 charity law, comprises 160 expatriate volunteers and 2180 local employees (2012 figures).Ils coordonnent l'aide du bout du monde, Le Parisien, 27 d√©cembre 2013 Each year it carries out over 120 humanitarian programs in 16 countries.  Origin of Solidarit√©s International  Solidarit√©s International's humanitarian action dates back to 1979 and the war in Afghanistan. Five French citizens, including Patrice Franceschi, Alain Boinet and Patrick Brizay, launched the ‚Äúcaravans of hope‚Äù to provide aid for the local inhabitants. With the help of the Afghan resistance, they crossed the border in secret and delivered much-needed humanitarian aid to the population throughout the country.Mission humanitaire, apporter de l'eau, Valeurs Vertes, 1er mai 2012 This was the first mission by Solidarit√©s International.  Action and expertise  Solidarit√©s International's mission is to go further in terms of humanitarian aid. The aim of the organization is not only to respond to the vital needs of populations faced with humanitarian crises resulting from armed conflicts or natural disasters but also to support the survivors on the road to autonomy and growth, especially in the areas of water, hygiene, sanitation and food security. = Emergency Action = During a conflict or following a natural disaster, Solidarit√©s International intervenes by responding to the basic needs of water, food and shelter. The emergency response follows a three-stage action plan: * Diagnosis of the emergency situation: a team of experts makes a detailed on-the-spot diagnosis to evaluate the size of the disaster and the needs of the populations affected. The diagnosis report then enables the most appropriate humanitarian response to be prepared. * Response to the most urgent needs: the public is informed of the situation and donors are sought. Funds collected enable an intervention team and logistical resources to be sent into the field. Once on site the humanitarian team works with the local populations. Intervention includes the treatment and distribution of water, establishment of sanitation systems, distribution of hygiene kits, basic necessities, food and the means and support to establish temporary shelters. * Exit strategy: beyond the response to urgent needs, Solidarit√©s International is committed to strengthening the resilience capacities of the affected communities. The humanitarian teams establish conditions for gradual disengagement, enabling, where possible, community takeover of emergency activities or their replacement through the introduction or reintroduction of sustainable services. Thus, with a view to going beyond a simple humanitarian response, the actions carried out in the field are designed to be sustainable, collaborative and forward-looking. The necessary knowledge and tools are passed on to the affected populations so they are able to rebuild their lives. = Water, Hygiene and Sanitation = Solidarit√©s International works in the field with those populations most vulnerable to waterborne diseases. It intervenes to limit the propagation of these diseases. Its actions aim to: * Improve access to drinking water:La course de l'acc√®s √† l'eau potable, interview de Gr√©gory Built, Atlantico, 2 janvier 2014 distribution of drinking water, installation of wells, boreholes, catchment and protection of springs, drinking water supply networks. * Improve sanitation: installation of toilet facilities,Toilettes : l'invention du 21√®me si√®cle, Terra Eco, 19 novembre 2013 management of excreta and refuse and combating vectors of disease. * Promote good hygiene practices. * Support communities in the management of infrastructures: development of infrastructures in urban areas and protection of resources in rural areas. * Support communities to maintain their awareness-raising activities. = Food Security = Solidarit√©s International's action aims to respond to the most urgent food needs and to sustainably reinforce the livelihoods of the populations. * In an emergency situation and depending on the context, the organization prioritizes money transfer, cash distribution and market-value coupon programs. These are exchanged for food or basic necessities with local businesses, which has the effect of stimulating the local economy. As a last resort, the organization implements direct food distribution programs. * Alongside the emergency response, the organization intervenes to revive the livelihoods of the populations: distribution of agricultural inputs and livestock, money transfer programs, support for micro-enterprises and reconstruction of housing, access to essential services (vaccines and veterinary products for example). In addition, Solidarit√©s International's programs aim to increase yields and incomes from family farms by setting up public education projects, specific training programs, help with investment, activities to support producer groups, etc.  Values  Solidarit√©s International respects the principles as defined in its charter: * Independence * Non-discrimination and responses adapted to the situations of the assisted populations * Action in response to request from the affected populations or their representatives * Respect for the cultural identity and dignity of the individual * Tangible application of projects * Coordination and cooperation with the organizations and institutions involved * Information and public awareness  Missions  Every year Solidarit√©s International intervenes in an average of 16 countries by supporting more than 5.2 million people with their vital needs (2012 figures)Solidarit√©s International's 2012 annual report ; Africa Mali,Boatfuls of cash : how do you get money into fragiles states ?, The Guardian, 21 February 2015 Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, Chad, Cameroon. ; Asia Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Pakistan. ; Caribbean Haiti ; Middle East Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Iraq  Campaigns  In 2005, Solidarit√©s International began to prioritize action in water and sanitation. Since then Solidarit√©s International has initiated numerous flagship campaigns designed to raise awareness among the general public on worldwide water issues. Following ‚ÄúL‚Äôeau qui tue‚Äù (‚ÄúDeadly Water‚Äù) in 2006, the ‚ÄúVotre Goutte d‚ÄôEau‚Äú (‚ÄúYour Drop of Water‚Äù) campaign launched in 2007 aimed to shed light on the devastation caused by unsafe drinking water as well as to mobilize the public through a petition. This campaign has been organized each year for World Water Day and was also part of the 2012 World Water Forum, a decisive stage in the organization's struggle. For the 2010 World Water Day, the organization created a ‚Äúwall of water‚Äù for the public in front of the Louvre in Paris which delivered messages to passers-by with spotlights shining on jets of water. The organization also publishes the Water, Sanitation and Hygien Barometer which takes stock of the current state of access to this vital resource.  Funding  Solidarit√©s International receives funding from European and international donors, businesses and the general public. 91.5% of funds are assigned to humanitarian missions in the field (2015 figures). This figure reflects the organization's strategic commitment to the principle of action. The organization's accounts are certified by an auditor. As well as this internal monitoring, 95% of missions are subject to an external audit.

The team last fielded the No. 7 Ford Mustang GT part-time for J. J. Yeley. NY Racing Team is owned by John Cohen, who is one of the few African-Americans to have owned a NASCAR team in a major touring series. Background Johnathan \\"John\\" Cohen (born in 1975) is an African-American entrepreneur and team owner from New Jersey. Cohen began his business interests in nightclubs and taverns, before forming his race team, Xxxtreme Motorsport in the spring of 2009. Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series =Car No. 7 history = 2018‚Äìpresent On May 21, 2018, it was announced the team would be returning to the Cup Series for the Coca-Cola 600 for the first time since 2015, receiving a multi-year deal with Steakhouse Elite as a sponsor. J. J. Yeley was announced to drive the No. 7 car in a partnership with Premium Motorsports. After qualifying 40th, Yeley finished 38th after suffering from fuel pump issues on lap 191. The following week at Pocono they fielded a car in association with Premium Motorsports. Yeley qualified the car 37th and finished 32nd. After missing several races, the team returned to the track for the Coke Zero Sugar 400 in collaboration with BK Racing. Yeley drove the Steakhouse Elite No. 23 to an 18th place finish after starting 40th. The following week at Kentucky they finished 38th. After skipping the New Hampshire race, the team finished 28th at Pocono after starting 20th. After missing two more events, the team returned, in partnership with Premium, at Bristol. Yeley brought the No. 7 car home in 34th place. The team's collaboration with the No. 23 team continued after Front Row Motorsports' purchase of the No. 23 charter. Yeley drove the car to a 17th place finish at Las Vegas. NY Racing continued its partnership with Front Row Motorsports after the purchase of BK's charter. During the autumn Talladega race, the No. 23 team switched manufacturers from Toyota to Ford before switching back to Toyota for the next two races. Yeley continued being the driver of the No. 23 Toyota for the rest of the season and during the final race at Homestead-Miami Speedway, BK Racing operated as a Ford Fusion. With BK Racing officially shutting down at season's end and being absorbed into Front Row Motorsports, NY Racing and Front Row Motorsports ended their partnership. For 2019, NY Racing planned to run a No. 7 Steakhouse Elite Ford Mustang with Yeley as the driver, but they ended up never making an attempt. =Car No. 30 history = 2014 Before the 2014 Richmond spring race, the team purchased the owner points and assets of the recently defunct No. 30 from Swan Racing, including their race shop in Statesville, North Carolina, hoping to end their recent struggles in qualifying by having a solid points base. The team used No. 30 for Richmond due to NASCAR rules regarding ownership transfers, but switched back to the No. 44 thereafter. =Car No. 44 history = 2012‚Äì2014, 2015 The 44 car driven by J. J. Yeley at Sonoma Raceway in 2014 The team returned from hiatus and began running the Cup Series in November 2012. A car numbered 44 for David Reutimann was fielded at the 2012 AdvoCare 500 at Phoenix International Raceway with sponsorship from No Label Watches. Reutimann finished 40th, pulling out of the race early due to a vibration. For 2013, Scott Riggs was hired as the team's full-time driver and the team switched manufacturers from Chevrolet to Ford. The team attempted most races in the first half of the season, but following numerous instances of having to start and park, coupled with poor sponsorship, the team shut down for the year midseason, and Riggs moved to RBR Enterprises in the Camping World Truck Series. In 2014, J. J. Yeley moved to the team following his departure from Tommy Baldwin Racing. The team struggled for speed early in the season, failing to qualify for two races and withdrawing from two others. The team qualified for Richmond after the field was set by the rulebook due to rain, but were running four laps down when the engine expired on lap 384. In May, after failing to qualify for the Aaron's 499 in the All City Leasing & Warehousing Chevrolet SS, the team qualified for the 5-hour Energy 400 on speed in the Phoenix Warehouse Chevrolet SS, starting the race in the 35th position. However, they once again suffered an engine failure, finishing 41st. They then missed the Coca-Cola 600, and blew their third engine at Dover. The next week at Pocono, despite cutting down a tire mid-race, they were able to stay on the track and complete a race for the first time in their existence, finishing 38th. An incident-free race the next week at Michigan brought the team's best finish to that point, 36th, which they then bested again at Sonoma with a 34th. The team then withdrew from Kentucky in the midst of more personnel shuffling. The team was absent for most of the summer, returning as \\"Team Xtreme Racing\\" in September for the AAA 400 at Dover, with Timmy Hill as driver. The team made the race, but lost an engine early into the event. Former Tommy Baldwin Racing driver Reed Sorenson was signed by the team to compete in the 2015 Daytona 500 with Golden Corral sponsorship. Despite crashing on the final lap Sorenson was able to cross the start-finish line to record the team's first lead-lap finish, in 32nd place. Travis Kvapil was scheduled to drive the car in Atlanta, but they were forced to withdraw after the car, truck and hauler were stolen from a hotel parking lot. The race car and truck that was hauling the trailer have been recovered. The trailer and spare racing parts remain missing. After Kvapil failed to qualify for the next three races, combined with Cohen facing his own civil arrest warrant for not answering an information subpoena, the team announced that they would withdraw from Martinsville in order to better prepare for Texas; however, they have not returned to the series since. On August 3, Jason Terry pleaded guilty in the theft of the Team Xtreme truck and trailer. Since then, the No. 44 became available and was later used by Richard Petty Motorsports for Brian Scott.

Tobacco Industry (TI) contains guidelines and industry classification and the products produced by the tobacco industry in Indonesia, including regulations, policies ribbon and excise, tobacco industry strategies, so on and so forth. Tobacco Industry was first coined by the Directorate General of Agro and Chemical Industry Department in 2009. Tobacco Industry has a significant role for state revenue through taxes and excise, employments, and protection against multiple impacts of tobacco farmers and others. The development of the TI also consider public health in addition to concern on, so that the industry can grow well. TP is a labor-intensive industry, so to the present of TI and its association with upstream form the procurement of raw materials, particularly tobacco, cloves, and other industries are potential labor-absorbing industrial. Classification Tobacco Industry also classify into three groups, namely : :Upstream Industry Group In Indonesia Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) 2005, Tobacco Industry classified in Upstream Industry Group is Drying and Processing Tobacco Industry (ISIC 16001). This groups include the field operations fogging and cutting-process-leaves tobacco. :Between Industry Group Tobacco Industry belonging to Reuters that Condiment Industry Cigarettes and other equipment (ISIC 16009), includes: cigarette flavoring and the other cigarette completeness such as klembak incense, cigarette sauce, uwur, klobot, kawung and manufacture of filters. :Downstream Industry Group Tobacco Industry that included in the Downstream Industry Group, such as: Cigarettes Industry (ISIC 16002), White Cigarette Industry (ISIC 16003) and other Cigarette Industry (ISIC 1600) includes cigars, cigarettes, incense and cigarettes klembak klobot/kawung. Strategy and policy Tobacco is one industry that contributes significantly to the revenues and also provide ample work opportunities for the community. On the other hand, the result of the tobacco industry also have negative effects for public health aspects. Therefore, any policies against tobacco industry ought to consider some aspects that are opposite to each other. In this case, the government has established the Tobacco Industry Road map drawn up jointly between the stakeholders concerned. The outline policy goals tobacco excise rates in 2013 also has to consider the elements contained in the Road map that referred to. In this context, details of a period of time to achieve those objectives have been outlined in the planning sequence as follows: *2006‚Äì2010: the order of priority on the labor aspects of balance, revenues and public health; *2010‚Äì2015: the order of priority on aspects of state revenues, public health, and labor; *2015‚Äì2020: order of priority on the public health aspects, labor and state revenues. *Vision and Direction of Development of Tobacco Industry Realization of Tobacco Industry strong and competitive in the domestic and global markets with attention to health aspects. Policy direction In order to achieve its goals for the development of national industry through triple track (pro- growth, pro-job, pro-poor), then the policy is directed at the development of TP: *Creation of business certainty and a conducive business climate *The growth in the short term (until 2009) preferred to tobacco-hand-made-products *Increased export *Handling of illegal cigarettes *Improved structure of the tobacco industry *Imposition of excise planned, conducive and moderate Indicators of achievement *Increased cigarette production to 240 billion cigarettes in 2010 and 2025 amounted to 260 billion sticks *Increasing the value of tobacco exports by 15% / year from U.S. $397.08 million in 2008 to U.S. $1,056.24 million in 2015 *Increased exports of cigarettes and cigars by 15% / year from U.S. $401.44 million in 2008 to U.S. $1,067.84 million in 2015 *Increased export of tobacco and tobacco products, especially to countries that are developing, Europe (cigars and tobacco), ex-Soviet Union, Africa, the US and Asia *Creation of varieties of tobacco plants and tobacco products that have a low level of risk to health; and *Decreased production and distribution of illegal cigarettes. Problems facing Tobacco Industry Tobacco Industry has remained an important role in growing the national economy, especially in the area of tobacco, cloves and cigarette production centers, among others, in growing industries/related services, the provision of agri-business field and employment. In the economic crisis, the TP is able to survive and neither conduct Termination of Employment (FLE), even this industry is able to provide a significant contribution to state revenue. In its development, the economic aspect is still a major consideration with regard to health impacts posed. Tobacco Industry has priority to be developed for processing natural resources, large enough to absorb labor either directly or indirectly, so as to contribute to state revenue (excise). Nevertheless, faced with today's TP issues include the impact of smoking on health issues both at the global level which is sponsored by the WHO as stated in Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and the national tobacco control set out in PP 19 of 2003 on securing of cigarettes for health. In addition, the TP is also faced with the excise policy issues that are not well-planned, it is not transparent and is more oriented towards the increase in state revenue without considering the ability of the tobacco industry and people's purchasing power, increased production and circulation illegal cigarettes. It is also the main problem is not the realization of the tobacco industry climate distorted competition, the supply of tobacco that does not meet the requirements and low quality. Each of these issues makes the appearance of the TP is currently not optimal. Climate uncontrolled competition resulted in the TP, particularly middle-class tobacco industry need protection from the government in order to grow. As well as the main raw material (tobacco and clove) still do not have the standard technical specifications as required industry. Consequently, the industry must bear the cost of re-grouping in order to be properly utilized in industrial processes. Contributions to GDP As one source of state income, excise has a very important contribution in the budget, especially in a group of Domestic Revenue. Customs receipts collected from three types of goods, namely; ethyl alcohol, beverages containing ethyl alcohol and tobacco products to revenue as reflected in the State Budget is increasing from year to year. In the 1990/1991, tax revenue was only Rp 1.8 trillion or contributes about 4 percent of domestic revenue, in the 1999/2000 the number has increased to Rp 10.4 trillion, accounted for 7.3 percent of domestic revenue. In 2003, the tax revenues were set at Rp 27.9 trillion or 8.3 percent of domestic revenue. Indonesia accounted for 2.1% of the stock of tobacco in the world. Tobacco Industry to contribute to state revenue through excise. In terms of state revenue in the form of foreign exchange, the value of exports of tobacco and tobacco products also plays an important role. Tobacco Industry has contributed greatly to employment as well as one of the objects that can be used as a source of revenue associated with Tobacco Excise. More specifically, the cigarette industry has contributed most to the Indonesian state budget, the value contribution of excise duty for the year amounted to 35 trillion RP with a total production of 180 billion cigarettes (data GAPRI ytd September 2008). The cigarette industry is promising with an average growth of 5-7% / year (TEMPO Interactive, December 10, 2008).

The word \\"fan\\" refers to the number of associations correlated with the concept.  The origin of the fan effect  The fan effect first appeared in a series of experiments conducted by John R. Anderson, a cognitive psychologist, in 1974. The three experiments he conducted involved participants learning 26 sentences that paired a person with a location. Additionally, they were asked to determine whether or not a particular sentence that was given to them belonged to the 26 they were asked to study. An example of a sentence Anderson used in his experiment was: \\"A hippie is in the park.\\" Some sentences seemed similar in the sense that a person was paired with another location. For instance, \\"A hippie is in the church.\\" Results revealed that participants produced a longer retrieval time when a person was paired with more than one location. Overall, these experiments demonstrated that multiple associations, such as including a large number of nouns in a sentence, interfered with the recognition time by producing a much slower effect. Association splitting, a self-help technique devised for individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), builds upon the fan-effect. In OCD, associations are typically constricted to OCD-related meanings (e.g., fire = danger, cancer = death). Patients are taught to contemplate alternative meanings to reduce the strength of fearful associations (e.g., fire = diamond, cancer = zodiac sign). According to a systematic review, the technique leads to a significant reduction of OCD symptoms relative to control conditions. Spreading activation In the brain, memory stores information in a network of nodes that are linked together. When a memory is retrieved, activation spreads on the links until it intersects or enough time has passed. If there is one association, the activation only has to spread to a single link whereas multiple associations would divide the activation to many links. Because there are so many connections, it causes the brain to take a longer time to identify the concepts and retrieve the memory. Plausible theories The fan effect is due to multiple mental models and is included as part of the ACT-R theory. The key factors that the fan effect is dependent on are the strength and degree to which one of the variables can predict the other and the importance of the concept to a person during the retrieval process. Concepts can be better recognized by similar ideas instead of a random order of ideas. When stored in a random order, the concepts are placed in independent places in the brain instead of putting the concepts together as one unit. The fan effect can be reduced if random sentences are exposed frequently and unified into one concept. The time it takes to retrieve information using the fan effect increases with age because of age-related effects/interference with retrieval.Gerard, L., Zacks, R. T., Hasher, L., & Radvansky, G. A.

From 1960 to 1962, Alcala is believed to have killed women in Mexico City who were known to work as prostitutes in poor inner-city neighborhoods, possibly in an attempt to imitate the infamous murderer Jack the Ripper. Despite only confessing to a single murder, Alcala is also heavily suspected of committing the murders of at least eleven other women around Mexico City. Alcala was apprehended in September 1962 and sentenced to 60 years in prison, the maximum penalty at the time, for the murder of two women. Background Born in the 1930s in Mexico City, Alcala developed an inferiority complex. Alcala entered into the Mexican Army, but was eventually dismissed for his incompetence and lack of discipline, and also tried to become a professional boxer but failed. Alcala was known to have been married and had children, but had separated from his wife for unknown reasons. Murders In 1960, the bodies of numerous female prostitutes began to appear in motel rooms in poor neighborhoods of Mexico City, and initially the police didn't believe that the murders were related. On September 20, 1962, the body of Julia Gonz√°lez Tejedas, a prostitute and mother of 4 children who worked in a local bar named El Imperial, was discovered in a room of a motel named Drigales in Colonia Guerrero. Gonz√°lez was strangled in the room and there were no signs of struggle; her unclothed body was placed in a theatrical position on the bed. With lipstick the killer wrote \\"Jak mexicano, reto a Cueto\\" on a mirror in the room, translating to \\"Challenge to Cueto. Mexican Jack\\" in English. \\"Cueto\\" was the surname of the Police Chief at the time and \\"Jak\\" was presumably a misspelling of Jack. Jack Mexicano (Spanish for \\"Mexican Jack\\" or \\"Jack the Mexican\\") became a popular name for the then- unknown murderer among the press and the Mexican public. The name was most likely chosen as a reference to the notorious British murderer Jack the Ripper, who was accused of murdering at least five women working as prostitutes in impoverished areas of 19th century London, but was ultimately never caught. Due to the similarities of the murderers and the possible reference to Jack the Ripper, it is generally considered that Alcala was a copycat killer. Arrest and conviction After the discovery of the body of Julia Gonz√°lez Tejedas, the police interrogated her bar partners and the Drigales motel staff. After obtaining a spoken portrait of the Gonz√°lez's last client, they were eventually lead to Alcala and he was arrested days after. Alcala confessed to the murder of Gonz√°lez, but denied committing any of the other killings which he was accused of, which included around twelve women who has been murdered in Mexico City's poor neighborhoods in a similar fashion to Gonz√°lez from 1960 to 1962. While only confessing to the individual murder, during interrogation Alcala made comments regarding the murders of the other women that contained only information the police would know and the media didn't know. This leak of information was successfully linked by the police to committing the killing of another woman in January 1962. Macario Alcala Canchola was sentenced to 60 years of prison, which was the maximum penalty at the time in Mexico City, for the 1962 murders of Julia Gonz√°lez Tejedas and a second woman. Mental health Alcala's relatives and acquaintances had described him as frequently egotistical and frustrated. Due to the fact that he divulged information about his murders, regardless of whether he confessed to committing them or not, he was diagnosed with Narcissistic personality disorder.

It grows up to 80 cm, usually on seaward reef slopes or hard bottoms. The color of L. arboreum varies from pale olive-green to yellow or grey. L. arboreum are anthozoans in the order Alcyonacea in the family Nephtheidae. The L. arboreum was originally classified in 1775 by Peter Forssk√•l, a Swedish Linnaean naturalist. As of 2016, the entire genus Litophyton was reclassified using phylogenetic data, in contrast to its original morphological classification. WoRMS - World Register of Marine Species - Litophyton arboreum Forsk√•l, 1775 Litophyton arboreum - Information on Litophyton arboreum - Encyclopedia of Life  Ecology  L. arboreum is commonly found in the Red Sea. A 1997 reef transect study showed that octocorals, such as L. arboreum, compose under 20% of soft coral coverage on both reef flats, and the upper fore-reefs in the Gulf of Eilat, off the East coast of the Sinai Peninsula. Typically in Gulf of Eilat reefs, octocoral coverage is dominated by carpets of a few species. A possible explanation for this extensive, monospecific coverage is periods of rapid growth. L. arboreumis not typically one of these dominant octocorals, but can compose up to 36% of living soft coral coverage, as seen in the Gulf of Eilat Nature Reserve. In other Red Sea locations, L. arboreum composes as little as 3% of soft coral coverage, such as in the South and Center Muqebla regions. As observed in other species of corals, space for settlement on the reef is one of the most important limiting factors for new colonies of L. arboreum. Similarly, physical factors‚Äîsuch as wave action, temperature variation, salinity and light‚Äì and biological factors‚Äì such as competition, predation, and disease‚Äì limit the success and prevalence of L. arboreum. Specifically, predation and competition for space may disrupt continuous community development for some species of Red Sea soft corals, resulting in patchy, discontinuous, communities spread across the reef. However, the coexistence of stony corals, soft corals, and algae in the Gulf of Eilat suggests that no one component has a distinct competitive dominance on the reef; instead, spatial variation results in different species exhibiting competitive dominance in different locations based on their unique ecological niches. At present, the intra- and interspecific competitive hierarchy of L. arboreum is unknown. In other Red Sea locations, such as the Gulf of Aqaba off the Jordanian coast, L. arboreum is found in well developed reefs. The Aqaba reefs are unique to other coastal reefs due to their lack of spur and groove patterns on the fore-reef. Spur and groove formations are most likely absent due to the relatively calm waters of the Gulf of Aqaba; the lack of major wind and wave action eliminates the force required. The Gulf of Aqaba reefs are biogenic in origin, like the majority of reefs globally, and well developed on capes. The developed capes are distinct, and separated by sandy embayments that correspond to past dried river beds. As in other coastal reefs, the Aqaba reefs are fringed by shallow bays containing beds of seagrass, which lead into the reefs. The reefs themselves have wide, built, coral formations abundant at a depth of 20m, and reef flats most abundant at 60m. The spatial distribution of the corals present in the Aqaba community suggest ecological succession‚Äì driven primarily by geologic and ecological forces‚Äì is responsible for the topography of the reef. The existing Aqaba reefs are highly diverse, though future reef expansion is limited by steep shelf inclines, and any major expansion is highly unlikely given the benthic topography of the existing reefs.  Symbiosis and reproduction  L. arboreum (Red Sea, Egypt) The reproductive mechanisms of L. arboreum have been extensively studied, and offer a unique insight into anthozoa reproduction‚Äì particularly in regard to the uptake of symbiodinium. L. arboreum, like other corals, have a relationship with an endosymbiotic dinoflagellate. Often referred to as zooxanthellae, the genus symbiodinium is a point of extensive research, and its relationship with corals remains largely enigmatic. In a 1992 study, researchers found that in L. arboreum spawning events, gametes released for fertilization were already associated with symbiodinium. Such an observation suggests that the symbiodinium were incorporated into the gametes, the oocytes, during oogenesis‚Äì the cellular division process yielding haploid oocytes. There are two primary strategies of symbiodinium uptake by anthozoans. Individuals can either take symbiodinium from the maternal colony, or they can uptake new symbiodinium from the surrounding environment. In situations of environmental uptake, zooplankton can act as an intermediary, transferring the symbiodinium from the surrounding water column, to the daughter colony. The vast majority of scleractinian, or CaCO‚ÇÉ reef-building corals, lack symbiodinium in their broadcast gametes, indicating that the daughter coral are reliant on the surrounding environment to acquire symbiodinium. Some species of octocorals‚Äì such as L. arboreum‚Äìhave indicated an uptake strategy of maternal transfer. L. arboreumis a gonochoric planulae brooder, meaning that individual coral colonies have separate sexes, and reproduction is dependent on spawning events in which gametes are broadcast into the surrounding water for fertilization, creating genetically distinct individuals which develop into new colonies. L. arboreum undergoes oogenesis cyclically, biannually, and has a highly specialized mechanism of symbiont uptake indicative of obligate mutualism and coevolution between the symbiodinium and the L. arboreum. During oogenesis, symbiodinium found in the adjacent gastrovascular cavity of the parent L. arboreum are incorporated into the haploid daughter cells of the oocytes. Stud-like cellular features on the exterior of epidermal cells that link together individual cells to form a cellular matrix‚Äì similar to the bumps on legos, or the hooks in velcro, and resemblant of hemidesmosomes‚Äì and link together the gastrodermal cells, locking into place the receptive cells and making symbiodinium transfer possible. While in place, gaps open in the mesoglea tissue beneath the follicular cells, and the parent symbiodinium, present in the vacuoles of follicular and gastrodermal cells, move through the mesogleal gaps and are up-taken by microvilli on the undeveloped oocyte prior to the completion of oogenesis. Once uptaken by the oocytes, the symbiodinium are then covered with a thin layer of cells, later followed by a thicker follicular layer composed of gastrodermal cells from the maternal colony. Following symbion uptake, the gaps close, leaving a single, continuous mesoglea. Evidence suggests that symbions that are unsuccessfully uptaken‚Äì either rejected by the oocyte, or that die after uptake‚Äì are consumed and used as nutrients by the daughter cell. In summary, symbiodinium stored in the maternal colony are inserted into reproductive cells before they are broadcast into the environment, yielding haploid cells associated with symbiodinium before fertilization. This strategy of maternal symbion transfer may lead to more successful colonization; individuals have a higher chance of survival if new colonies do not need to establish their own symbiosis. Historically, this maternal symbiont transfer is of great significance, because it is the first indication of cell-bound symbiodinium found in the vacuoles of parent cells not being exclusively used for symbiosis. Further, L. arboreum is one of very few corals that has recorded evidence of maternal symbiodinium transfer, offering a unique insight into the complex world of coral reproduction.  Medical applications  Like many other reef-dwelling organisms, L. arboreumhas applications in the medical field, many of which are unknown. A 2006 study showed that 83% of Red Sea Alcyonacean corals exhibited antimicrobial activity against a variety of marine bacteria found in the surrounding environment. As a means of combating microbial attacks, Red Sea Alcyonacean corals use antibiotic compounds as a chemical defense. A 2018 study specifically on L. arboreum was able to find and isolate a pseudoguaiane-type sesquiterpene compound, an organic molecule, litopharbol, which exhibits both antimicrobial and anticancer activity, and has direct applications to medicine.

It stars British actress Barbara Steele in the roles of Helen Rochefort and Mary, Italian actor George Ardisson as Kurt Humboldt, and Polish actress Halina Zalewska in a dual role as Adele Karnstein and her daughter Lisabeth. It is set in a 15th-century feudal castle, and the nearby village. Plot In a 15th-century feudal village, Adele Karnstein is accused of witchcraft and burned at the stake. Her beautiful older daughter Helen knows the real reason for the execution is Count Franz Humboldt‚Äòs sexual desire for her mother. After confronting the count, he kills Helen. Adele‚Äôs younger daughter, Lisabeth, is taken to live in the Humboldt castle. When she grows up Lisabeth is forced to marry the now deceased count‚Äôs worthless nephew, Kurt. A horrible and deadly plague sweeps the land. During a thunderstorm, a mysterious woman appears named Mary, strongly resembling Helen. In an atmosphere of cruelty, superstition, sexuality and the scourge of the plague, Mary begins to avenge Adele‚Äôs death. Production The Long Hair of Death was written by Ernesto Gastaldi and Tonino Valerii. Gastaldi told Tim Lucas that Valerii had attempted to start his career as a director with the film, but that the producer had Antonio Margheriti chosen. Gastaldi also stated that the producer did not have Valerii direct as he had no experience at that time. Most of the production was shot at Massimo Castle in Arsoli.  Cast  *Barbara Steele as Helen Rochefort / Mary *George Ardisson as Kurt Humboldt *Halina Zalewska as Adele Karnstein / Lisabeth Karnstein *Giuliano Raffaelli as Count Humboldt *Laura Nucci as Grumalda *Umberto Raho as Von Klage *Nello Pazzafini as the Servant Release Produced by Felice Testa Gay's company Cinegai S.p.A., I lunghi capelli della morte was released in Italy on December 30, 1964 through the distributor U.N.I.D.I.S. It grossed a total of 321 million Italian lira on its theatrical release. The film was released on DVD in the United States by East West Entertainment, as a double feature with Terror-Creatures from the Grave, and through the Midnight Choir label as a double feature with An Angel for Satan. Reception In a contemporary review, the Monthly Film Bulletin found the film was \\"erratically scripted, unusually clumsily dubbed, and sagging badly in the middle\\" it still had \\"enough good sequences to lift it well out of the rut\\" and was \\"a pleasingly atmospheric Gothic tale\\". The review compared Margheriti to Mario Bava, stating that he \\"hasn't quite the same gift as Bava for this sort of thing\\" but still \\"acquits himself creditably\\". The review also praised the acting of Halin Zalewska and Barbara Steele finding the latter to be \\"her usual extraordinary self\\". In retrospective reviews, the film was called a \\"superior monochrome gothic\\".Hughes, p.87 Roberto Curti, author of Italian Gothic Horror Films felt the film was not as strong as Margheriti's Danza macabara (Castle of Blood). Margheriti himself stated that he did not like the film, because he felt the script and story were of poor quality. Video Librarian referred to the film as a \\"minor classic of Gothic horror\\" noting that it was \\"short on traditional horror set pieces (and plot)\\" but \\"boasts plenty of lovely imagery and ominous atmosphere.\\" References =Notes= =Bibliography=    External links  * 1964 films 1964 horror films Italian horror films Italian films Films directed by Antonio Margheriti Films scored by Carlo Rustichelli Films set in the 1490s Films set in the Holy Roman Empire Gothic horror films ","title":"The Long Hair of Death"},{"id":"42574816","text":"Shaun Byrne is the name of: * Shaun Byrne (footballer, born 1981), English- born footballer who represented the Republic of Ireland * Shaun Byrne (footballer, born 1993), Scottish footballer (Dunfermline Athletic, Livingston) See also *Sean Byrne (disambiguation) ","title":"Shaun Byrne"},{"id":"42574839","text":"Will R.

One of his most famous tracks is part of the soundtrack of the popular football video game by EA Sports: \\"Get on the Floor\\" in FIFA 07. \\"Me Gustan\\" in FIFA 09 and \\"The Instrumento\\" in 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa. Get on the Floor also featured in the reality tv show, The Chicas Project. Career Jos√© Antonio Bravo was born in Arica, a city in the extreme northern region of Arica y Parinacota Region of Chile in 1975. Bitman moved Santiago in the 1990s to study and then work as a designer. There he met architect Christian Powditch, with whom he began to explore music composition with very simple software. The duo eventually acquired the name ‚ÄúBitman & Roban‚Äù (a play on Batman & Robin). The sound of their first album ‚ÄúHurtos‚Äù (‚ÄúRobberies‚Äù, 2000) was very close to Hip Hop. On their second album, ‚ÄúRobar es natural‚Äù (‚ÄúStealing is natural‚Äù, 2002), the duo included real voices and instruments, changing the previous purely digitally constructed sound. In 2003, DJ Bitman released his first solo album, ‚ÄúSunset beats‚Äù (2003) with the collaboration of jazz bassist Roberto Titae Lindl (Los Tres) and members of Tiro de Gracia and Los Tetas. ‚ÄúM√∫sica para despu√©s de almuerzo‚Äù (‚ÄúMusic for after lunch‚Äù, 2005) was his third album with Bitman & Roban, this time as a whole band instead of a duo. In 2006, he collaborated as a producer in the album ‚ÄúQuintana Roo‚Äù (R-H), a side project, and in 2007 released ‚ÄúLatin Bitman‚Äù, a mix of electronic bases and acoustic instruments such as (Double bass, Marimba, Guitar, Piano and Hammond organ). This produced an exotic sound than resembles jazz, bossa nova, funk, chachach√° and mambo. In live performances, Latin Bitman is supported by an orchestra. ‚ÄúColour‚Äù (2009) repeated the technique of including different elements and takes this even further. It also included Bitman‚Äôs first collaboration with Francisca Valenzuela on the track \\"Help me‚Äù. In 2011, Bitman teamed up with Eric Bobo of Cypress Hill to form the group Ritmo Machine, which released the album \\"Welcome To The Ritmo Machine\\" in November 2011.

She is best known for being a Holocaust survivor, and as a scholar and childhood friend of the famed memoirist Anne Frank. Nussbaum is frequently consulted on Anne Frank works and literature. Nussbaum was a professor of Foreign Languages and Literature at Portland State University. After retirement Nussbaum now lectures on the Holocaust, Anne Frank and her experience during World War II. While at Portland State, she also became the head of the German section of the Foreign Language Department. Nussbaum's publications on 20th-century German literature and literature written in Dutch by German refugees are often referenced in academia. Friendship with Anne Frank Nussbaum was born Hannelore Klein in Frankfurt, Germany. As Germany became increasingly hostile toward Jews, Nussbaum's family moved from Frankfurt to Amsterdam in 1936. In her new neighborhood, Nussbaum met Anne Frank. Nussbaum's family and the Frank family had been friends in Frankfurt, though Nussbaum had not known the Frank children at that time. Nussbaum became closest to Anne's sister Margot. While growing up together, Nussbaum remembers Anne as \\"vivacious and smart\\", though the two were not particularly close. In fact, Nussbaum was \\"rather indifferent\\" about Anne, considering her a \\"noisy chatterbox\\" and \\"a shrimp\\". After Anne and most of her family were killed, Nussbaum remained close to Otto Frank, Anne's father and the only surviving member of Anne's immediate family. Otto was the best man at Nussbaum's wedding to Rudi. Nussbaum has written about the fact that Anne Frank rewrote a large part of her spontaneous diary entries with the intention to publish an epistolary novel based on her diary. While clear that \\"Otto should be congratulated for probably being the first to publish a document from the Holocaust,\\" she has criticized him for combining Anne's two versions of her diary into one without explanation. Of the memory that she keeps of Anne, Nussbaum stated in 1995 \\"Memory easily fools you and my memory is coloured, inevitably, by the fact that she has become so famous. I always found her lively and keen, but would never have thought she would turn into this icon. I am afraid the icon has become, for some people, a source of income and the person Anne is obscured by this. She stands as a symbolic figure upon whom the world can heap both its guilt and its commiseration.\\" Holocaust The Klein family moved to Amsterdam in 1936 to escape the increasing antisemitism in Germany. However, when the Nazis invaded the Netherlands in 1940, Jews were barred from many public places and in 1942 were forced to wear yellow stars on their clothing to denote their ethnicity. At the time of the invasion Nussbaum was twelve. The Klein family was able to elude deportation because they were only part Jewish, claiming that Mrs. Klein was not Jewish at all. After that claim was accepted by the German authorities, only Nussbaum's father had to wear the yellow star on his clothing. The rest moved about society without issue. This is the subject of her book Shedding Our Stars: A Story of Hans Calmeyer and How He Saved Thousands of Families Like Mine published in 2019. Nussbaum first met her future husband Rudi Nussbaum in Amsterdam, and acted as liaison for him while he was in hiding. Rudi hid for four years before the war ended, at first living with Dutch peasants, then in the countryside, and finally in the Klein home. The two married in 1947, two years after the war had ended. Of the experience Nussbaum stated \\"I would not have chosen, at the age of 13 or 14, a deep sense of obligation that someone was dependent upon you. But in all situations in life, you have to rise to the occasion. We decided the other person was decent and worth it.\\" Life in America In 1955, Nussbaum, along with her husband and children, spent a year in Indiana, where Rudi did post- doctoral research. Together Nussbaum and Rudi had three children; two sons and one daughter. Upon settling in California in 1957, Nussbaum changed her first name from Hannelore to Laureen. In 1959, Rudi gained a position at Portland State University and the family moved to Portland, Oregon. While teaching part time at the same institution, Nussbaum acquired her Ph.D. and eventually a full time position in the Foreign Languages and Literature department, where she became Professor Emerita in 1989. On July 22, 2011, Nussbaum's husband Rudi died after taking a fall in the Amsterdam Airport while the two were on holiday. After his funeral, he was cremated in Holland. The funeral was followed by a memorial service at the University Place Hotel and Conference Center in Portland. In literature Nussbaum is published on a number of topics in multiple languages. Some key works include: On Anne Frank \\"Anne Frank,\\" in Women Writing in Dutch. \\"Anne Frank, The Writer,\\" in Mit den Augen eindes Kindes: Children in the Holocaust: Children in Exile: Children under Fascism. \\"Anne Frank: From Shared Experiences to a Posthumous Literary Bond,\\" in Oregon English Journal. \\"Anne's Diary Incomplete.
