It is often wrongly attributed to vocalist Ethel Waters, who first recorded it on September 18, 1926 with Will Marion Cook's Singing Orchestra. Waters is credited with popularizing it. Cornetist Bix Beiderbecke, pianist Fats Waller and the Paul Whiteman Orchestra featuring Bing Crosby all recorded it in 1927. The song has become a jazz standard, popular with Dixieland musicians. History Ethel Waters first recorded it for Columbia Records on September 18, 1926 and she identified Heywood and Cook as the authors in her autobiography. It was Waters who popularized the tune. The following year, Waters first sang it during her Broadway premiere in a production of Africana at Daly's Sixty-third Street Theatre. After the Waters release, the tune was adopted by numerous Dixieland groups, who increased the tempo. Cornetist Bix Beiderbecke recorded the song in 1927 with Frankie Trumbauer, and it was subsequently widely recorded in the late 1920s and 1930s by artists such as Fats Waller (with the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra in New York on 11 May 1927), Bing Crosby with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra on April 29, 1927 in one of Crosby's earliest recordings, Django Reinhardt, Artie Shaw, Art Tatum (The Genius of Art Tatum, 1953-4) Maxine Sullivan, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong. Teddy Wilson had a widely successful recording of the song in late 1937. In 1938, Benny Goodman featured it in his renowned concert of that year. Paul Whiteman re-recorded the song, and had a second hit with it in December. In following decades it was recorded by Erroll Garner, Gene Krupa, Al Cohn, and Steve Lacy. Billie Holiday adopted the tune, and performed it \\"Chicago style\\". Though the song declined somewhat in popularity after the 1950s, it remains a staple of Dixieland musicians. Jimmy Rushing also recorded \\"I'm Coming Virginia\\" with his big band in 1958. In 1974, guitarist Charlie Byrd performed a rendition of the tune at the Concerts by the Sea in Redondo Beach, California, which appeared on his Byrd by the Sea album. Billboard praised the sensitivity and delicate nature of the album recording. Violinist Stephane Grappelli recorded it with George Shearing for their 1976 album The Reunion. In 2000, bassist Michael Moore's trio recorded it for the History of Jazz, Vol. 1 compilation. Structure Alec Wilder says of the song in American Popular Song: The Great Innovators, 1900-1950: The song, popular with Dixieland musicians, features lyrics such as \\"And if I can win ya, I'll never more roam, I'm coming Virginia, My Dixieland home.\\" References 1926 songs 1920s jazz standards Bing Crosby songs Dixieland jazz standards Songs about Virginia ","title":"I'm Coming Virginia"},{"id":"53484287","text":"Glenea pagana is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

Born in Prague, Bohemia (in the present-day Czech Republic), he began his studies in 1928 with the Institute for Egyptology and Africanistic at the University of Vienna, completing his dissertation on a Hausa Dialect in 1932. From 1934 to 1938 he carried out fieldwork in Zeniya, Egypt where he studied and recorded the pronunciation of Coptic by Copts in the area near Luxor, later collaborating with William Worrel in the production of \\"Popular Traditions of the Coptic Language\\" in 1934. From 1948, he resided in Paris. In 1960, he settled with his family in Geneva, Switzerland, where, from 1973-1980, he was titular professor of Egyptology and Hamito-Semitic (Afroasiatic) Languages at the University of Fribourg. After publishing numerous scholarly articles in the various topics of his expertise, in 1978 Vycichl was instrumental in the founding of the Soci√©t√© √âgyptologique de Gen√®ve.

Funded by the local education authority, it is run as a free school by the University of Cambridge and is the first University Training School for primary in the UK. With a planned capacity of 630 pupils, the school is also used for teacher training and acts as a centre for educational research. History Following the University's 800th anniversary in 2009, plans were formed to address the issue of the lack of affordable accommodation for its staff and post-graduate students. The 150-hectare North West Cambridge Development between Madingley Road and Huntingdon Road was identified as an area for development, and in February 2013 formal planning approval was granted for development of the site to include 1500 homes for university staff, 1500 homes for private sale, and accommodation for 2000 graduate students. To help support this, a primary school was also included in the plans, and work began on the site following a ground-breaking ceremony on 14 November 2014. The school opened with the new school year in September 2015 with two Reception classes, one Year One class, and one Year Two class. In September 2016 three Reception classes were added. Over time the school will fill as the initial intake becomes older until there are three classes in each year up to Year Six. Building The school was created by architects Marks Barfield, designers of the London Eye, and is circular in shape enclosing a central courtyard. Drawing inspiration from Mandy Swann's book Creating learning without limits, the school encompasses a \\"learning street\\", a central space that runs between the classrooms that themselves open directly onto the space without the need for doors. The school building received the 2017 RIBA East Award for its design and build.https://www.architecture.com/awards-and- competitions-landing-page/awards/riba-regional-awards/riba-east-award- winners/2017/university-of-cambridge-primary-school References Primary schools in Cambridgeshire Schools in Cambridge ","title":"University of Cambridge Primary School"},{"id":"53484580","text":"Tell Me How may refer to *\\"Tell Me How\\", song by Buddy Holly from The \\"Chirping\\" Crickets *\\"Tell Me How\\", song by Chad Brock from III *\\"Tell Me How\\", song by Paramore from After Laughter ","title":"Tell Me How"},{"id":"53484593","title":"Told You So (Paramore song)"},{"id":"53484597","text":"Robert Stuart Kelsall (born 29 June 1946 in Stockport) is an English former first-class cricketer active 1969 who played for Nottinghamshire.Robert Kelsall at ESPNcricinfo References 1946 births English cricketers Nottinghamshire cricketers Living people Cheshire cricketers ","title":"Robert Kelsall"},{"id":"53484599","title":"At My Best"},{"id":"53484604","title":"List of snooker ranking tournaments"},{"id":"53484606","text":"Lionel Kirk (1 November 1884 ‚Äì 27 February 1953) was an English first-class cricketer active 1920‚Äì29 who played for Nottinghamshire.

Irish Nationalists and Republicans believe that collusion took place between the British security forces and Loyalist paramilitaries in the shootings. The six men who were killed became known as \\"The New Lodge Six\\". Background The Troubles broke out in August 1969 with severe rioting in Belfast and the British army was called in to restore order. Shortly after, the newly formed guerrilla movement the Provisional IRA waged a campaign against the British of shooting and bombing. In response, Loyalist paramilitary groups such as the Ulster Volunteer Force and (UDA) waged a campaign of killings against the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland and also bombed targets in the Republic of Ireland. The conflict was a bloody and bitter one with all sides carrying out massacres of civilians. The incidents included McGurk's Bar bombing, which killed 15 civilians, was carried out by the UVF, Bloody Sunday, in which the British army shot dead 14 Catholic civilians and Bloody Friday, which killed 9 people (2 British soldiers, 1 UDA member and 6 Civilians) was carried out by the IRA. The New Lodge, on the edge of the city centre, with a history of active Irish republicanism and surrounded by Loyalist areas, saw much violence during The Troubles. Most of the remaining Protestant population left under intimidation in the early 1970s, to be replaced by Catholics intimidated from Loyalist areas of Belfast. As a stronghold of the Third Battalion of the Provisional IRA's Belfast Brigade, rioting and gun battles between the IRA and the British Army and loyalist paramilitaries were almost daily occurrences during the early 1970s and other periods of high political tension such as the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike, and occurred sporadically during the rest of that period. The area was vulnerable to attacks by Loyalist paramilitaries throughout The Troubles, particularly to drive-by shootings. The corner of the New Lodge Road and the Antrim Road was statistically the most dangerous spot to stand at in Northern Ireland. Shootings In the first four days of February 1973, fourteen people died and many more were injured in numerous gun attacks across the city. On Friday 2 February, the hooded body of 28-year-old Catholic, Patrick Bradley from Andersonstown, was found in a car in Maurice Street. An 18-year-old petrol pump attendant was shot dead in his caf√© on York Road. Earlier in the day, ten people from the Beechmount area were injured when gunmen opened fire from a passing car. Undercover British army involvement was suspected in the Beechmount shooting. In Ardoyne, in a similar attack, residents escaped injury. Tension was high in Belfast on Saturday 3 February. The UDA had paraded from many parts of the city to the Laddas Drive RUC station to demand the release of two of its members who had recently been interned. This was the first time Loyalists were threatened with internment and there were many protests and rioting by Loyalists in Belfast because of it. The first shooting in the New Lodge area occurred at around 11.00pm when members of the UDA shot dead James Sloan (19) and James McCann (18), both IRA Volunteers, while they stood outside Lynch's Bar, in a drive-by shooting. The car drove down the Antrim Road and fire was directed at a Chinese restaurant injuring others. After the initial attack, residents gathered on the streets after hearing the shooting, they soon came under a hail of gunfire from several positions. British Army soldiers fired a number of rounds at a crowd of people from Duncairn Gardens down Edlingham Street and from the top of Templar and Alamein Flats. For the first time in Northern Ireland the army were using their new 'Nitesights'. Four more people, Tony Campbell (19), Ambrose Hardy (26), Brendan Maguire (33) and John Loughran (35) were shot dead by British snipers. Aftermath The British Army released a statement after the shootings in which they claimed that between 23.45 and 03.00 there was a severe gun battle in the New Lodge area. In about 30 separate incidents, nearly 200 shots were fired at the security forces and fire was returned on most occasions. They said that seven of the people shot were gunmen and six of them died, eyewitness claims dispute these statements claiming none of those shot was armed at the time they were killed. The sister of Ambrose Hardy claims he was waving a white petticoat when he was killed. Six years later Ambrose Hardy's brother John Hardy (43) was killed by UVF gunmen while he was having dinner with his six children.

The vote came in March of 2005, after four years of debate and an end to attempts for an international ban. In the 191-nation assembly, there were 84 votes in favor of a nonbinding statement, 34 against and 37 abstentions. Proposed by Honduras, the statement was largely supported by Roman Catholic countries and opposed by countries with active embryonic stem cell research programs. Many Islamic nations abstained. The UN Declaration on Human Cloning, as it is named, calls for all member states to adopt a ban on human cloning, which it says is \\"incompatible with human dignity and the protection of human life.\\" The US, which has long pushed for a complete ban, voted in favor of the statement while traditional ally Britain, where therapeutic cloning is legal and regulated, voted against it. The statement should have no impact on countries that allow therapeutic cloning, such as Britain and South Korea, as it is not legally binding. \\"The foes of therapeutic cloning are trying to portray this as a victory for their ideology,\\" Bernard Siegel, a Florida attorney who lobbies to defend therapeutic cloning, said in a Reuters report. \\"But this confusing declaration is an effort to mask their failure last November to impose a treaty on the world banning therapeutic cloning.\\"  References  * 50px This article contains quotations from Wikisource, which is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Generic (CC BY 2.5) license.

In 1970, he recorded the song \\"Desdemona,\\" which was composed for him by Mati Caspi and written by Gad Kaynar. In 1971, Desdemona reached the top of the Israeli Hit Parade. Early life and military David ben Ami (nicknamed \\"Dadi\\" from an early age) was born to one of the founding families of the Nahalal moshav. In his youth, he studied drama with the theater director and acting teacher Nola Chilton. He served in the IDF in the Southern Command Band and in the Northern Command Band. After his release from the army he studied theater studies at Tel-Aviv University and worked as an actor in the Cameri Theater. A short time later, he began his return to Jewish religious practice under the direction of Rabbi Israel Meir Lau and Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburgh. Influenced by friends from the Chabad Chassidic school of thought, he travelled to New York to spend an entire year in the court of the Lubavitcher Rebbe Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. Eventually, he returned to Jerusalem and chose to follow the directives of Breslov Chassidism. As part of his becoming a ba'al teshuva, he began to use his full name of \\"David Refael\\" and his original family name of \\"Feinshil\\" which was used by his ancestors in the Diaspora. His grandfather, who immigrated to Israel during the second aliya, had Hebraicised it to \\"Ben-Ami\\". For many years, he abandoned his musical career and focused on anthologizing ancient Chassidic melodies from the elderly people of the Meah Shearim neighborhood in Jerusalem, which he performed in his albums from 1988 onwards. He stated, \\"My mission is to endow the songs and to perpetuate the melodies.\\" In his appearances he performed Israeli songs, and in one of his later albums he sings Israeli songs and tunes that were inspired prior to the establishment of the State of Israel. Death David ben Ami contracted COVID-19 during the pandemic in Israel. He was hospitalized on October 7, 2020, when his health conditions worsened.

Pelzer (October 9, 1889 ‚Äì April 24, 1985) was an American art teacher, artist and muralist known for her work in public spaces. In addition to the mural for the post office mural project in Waverly, Iowa, she completed eight murals for the Hotel Jefferson, of Iowa City and a mural for the lobby of the Press-Citizen. In addition to her mural work, Pelzer was known for portraits, floral works and landscapes. Early life Mildred Lenore Weenink was born on October 9, 1889 in Auburn, Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin to Eudora D. (n√©e Thompson) and Henry D. Weenink. By the time she was two years old, her family had moved to Dillon, Montana, where she completed her schooling, graduating from the Montana State Normal School in 1909. Immediately upon her graduation, Weenink applied and was accepted to begin studies at the Pratt Institute, where she entered the following year. After two years of study at Pratt, Weenink graduated in 1912. Career Upon completing her schooling, Weenink was hired to teach at the Montana School for the Deaf, Blind, and Backward Children, in Boulder, Montana, but left after one term. Continuing her studies, Weenink attended Columbia University. From 1915 to 1916, Weenink taught in the public schools in Bedford, Indiana, before going to serve as director of the art department at the Dakota State Normal School in Madison, South Dakota. On January 1, 1917, in Dillon, Weenink married fellow teacher, Louis Pelzer, and they made their home in Iowa City, where Louis was teaching history at the University of Iowa. Once relocated, Pelzer began studying with Grant Wood and served as his publicist. She also studied with Marvin Cone and began her own career, painting portraits of college faculty and raised their two sons, Lorne Parker Pelzer and Henry Pelzer. In 1934, Pelzer was commissioned by the Works Progress Administration to create eight murals for the Hotel Jefferson, the largest structure in Iowa City at the time. The murals were four feet high by twelve feet long and depicted historic scenes from the development of the city from settlement to the twentieth century, spanning the period between the meeting of the Fox leader Poweshiek and settlers from the East to the arrival of automobiles. Pelzer confirmed historical details with her husband, who was a history professor. At the dedication banquet, attended by 150 people, the head of the political science department, Benjamin Shambaugh noted the significance of Pelzer's achievement to document the history of the state with artwork. That same year, she also produced a map, Iowa: Prairie Chronicles in Picture which covered significant historical events in the state and their locations. Her work was known nationally, having appeared on the cover of the July 1934 issue of Better Homes and Gardens. She also exhibited in Kansas City, Minneapolis and Philadelphia, as well as throughout Iowa and was chosen for a painting by the Packard Motor Company. Pelzer's mural for the Iowa City Press-Citizen Building took two years to prepare. In 1935, the preliminary painting for Symphony of Iowa was the state‚Äôs entry for an exhibition hosted by the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC) held in Detroit. When the Press-Citizen Building was completed in 1937, the painting was installed in the lobby. Around 1961, six of the Jefferson murals were placed in storage, having faded with light exposure. In 1966, At the Iowa City Landing, Symphony of Iowa, The Railroad Comes‚Äî1856 and We Build the Capitol were restored by Forrest Bailey who was commissioned by Richard T. Feddersen. In August 1937, Pelzer's painting of the Grinnell College campus was donated by Henry Hromek and his wife to the college in memory of their son. A month later, Pelzer won the federal commission to complete the post office mural for Waverly, Iowa, as part of the Section of Painting and Sculpture‚Ä≤s projects, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. The mural, A Letter from Home in 1856 depicts a scene of a couple on their farm, where the wife had brought a letter from their previous home to the field. As her husband paused his plowing, the wife read the letter to him, as their child grasped at her mother's skirts. In 2014, the post office, along with 40 other buildings in Waverly's historic district, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1940, Pelzer was one of the founders of the Iowa Artists Association and served as the chair of the organization. That same year, she was recognized with a national award given by the GFWC for her work in promoting art and with young artists. Tragedy struck the family during World War II, when both of their sons were killed in action. In the midst of their grief, Pelzer's husband Lewis died of a heart attack in 1946. After her husband's death, Pelzer focused on her painting, working in Florida, Hawaii, and Iowa and competed in several shows before moving to Hawaii in 1949 to create a series of gouache landscapes. Her Hawaiian landscapes were noted for their vibrant colors and for capturing movement. A portrait, Black Pearls received first place in an oil painting competition and she was asked by a local merchant to create a line of hand-painted dresses. She left Hawaii in 1950 to complete commission work in Cuba and Florida and resettled in Florida in 1952, after sending a floral painting to Wesley House, the new Methodist student center at Iowa University. Later that year, Pelzer remarried on 25 July 1952. Her second husband was retired Major General George Arthur Lynch. After her marriage, Pelzer-Lynch continued to paint with the encouragement of her husband. When he died in 1962, she traveled to Hawaii, Mexico, Spain and attended international exhibitions including the Venice Biennale and documenta in Kassel. A retrospective of her works was held in 1969 at the Loch Haven Art Center of Orlando. Death and legacy Lynch died on April 24, 1985 in Orlando, Florida. She and her first husband's papers were donated to the State Historical Society of Iowa and the collection, Pelzer family papers spans the period from 1904-1962. An annual scholarship is awarded in her name in art, American history and music, through a fund Lynch established prior to her death and a graduate fellowship bearing her name is given to art scholars pursuing graduate level studies at the University of Iowa. In 1973, the Iowa State Bank and Trust company restored two of the murals and rehung them in the Longfellow School. In 1992, the four murals restored by Feddersen were donated to the Cedar Rapids Museum of Art. A biography, Historic Scenes by Mildred Pelzer 1934: The Pampered and Tragic Life of an Iowa City Artist by Bob Hibbs was published by the Johnson County Historical Society in 2009.

The two Anubis Wesen arrive in Portland and kill Felix in his hotel room, where Nick and Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) find a shipping slip which they follow to the killers; in a fit of rage, Monroe tears out their throats. Nick and Monroe find Felix's trunk and take it to the spice shop. In addition to detailed catalogs of Wesen, the books contain Grimm family trees, including Nick's ancestry. Monroe finds a secret compartment and, using his watchmaker skills, unlocks it.

As if the clash of a populist monster conspiracy and a shadowy government agency weren't enough to drive the season, now there's the location of a treasure that could be anything up to and including the Ark of the Covenant. Yet despite everything else that‚Äôs going on, there's something about this introduction that feels like a jolt instead of a burden, the playing field suddenly expanded in the right way.\\" Kathleen Wiedel from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.5 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"Alas, poor Felix. We hardly knew you! At least he got to be in arguably one of the strongest episodes of the season thus far ‚Äì Grimm Season 5 Episode 10 was straightforward and tightly-written, and the Case of the Week (RIP Felix!) served the long-term arc. In this case, very long term: the Seven Keys were introduced all the way back in the pilot episode!\\" Lindi Smith from EW wrote, \\"Grimm serves up another amazing episode with 'Map of the Seven Knights.' The show choosing to have one overarching story that connects each episode this season is really paying off. Every episode so far in season 5 has been incredibly engaging and memorable.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman from TV.com, wrote, \\"Since its return from winter hiatus, Grimm has steadily redeemed itself for the sins of the early episodes of this season; returning to some of the show's dropped storylines and oldest mythology does well to connect the series' two dissonant tones. Just because the secret government mutant black-ops MIB terminator factory part of the universe is hilarious and awful doesn't mean it can't still be entertaining. If Grimm can maintain the balance between the stuff we actually care about and the stuff that makes us die inside, as shown in this week's episode, the series might (MIGHT) just return to being the Friday night highlight in my book. No promises though.\\" Christine Horton of Den of Geek wrote, \\"Yes it looks like the Grimm gang is finally off on a European adventure after they discover a series of mysterious links back to the old country. Well, the links are actually the long-forgotten keys from season one, now that the writers seem to have remembered they exist. They were part of an important thread at the time, so we should be grateful that the story is being picked up again, even if it's all still quite fuzzy at the moment. Essentially, they're a set of keys that produce a map to a place where something ‚Äì no-one knows what ‚Äì is buried.

He had been the Provost's Distinguished Research Professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of Central Florida since 2001. Since 2013, he had also been a Pegasus Professor there. He wrote 17 books and over 250 peer-reviewed papers. From 1978 until 2014, he was the editor-in-chief of the academic journal Social Science Research.  Education and career  Wright received his bachelor's degree from Purdue University and his M.S. and Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin. After receiving his Ph.D. in 1973, he joined the faculty of the University of Massachusetts Amherst as an assistant professor, where he remained until 1988, when he joined the faculty of Tulane University. In 2001, he left Tulane to join the sociology department at UCF as Distinguished Research Professor.  Research  Wright has researched several topics in the field of sociology, including poverty, homelessness, covenant marriage, and gun control. His assessment of numerous studies regarding gun ownership concluded that using a gun in self-defense increases the chances of harm to oneself, while also decreasing the chances that the user will be victimized by a criminal. In 1983, he collaborated with Peter Rossi and Kathleen Daly on a study underwritten by the National Institute of Justice which showed that about 1% of privately owned guns in the United States are used in crime; the study reported that the \\"benefits of stricter gun controls ... are at best uncertain, and at worst close to nil.\\" In 1986, he and Rossi published the book Armed and Considered Dangerous, which reported the results of a survey of 1,800 felons. They concluded, among other things, that handgun bans may be counterproductive, as criminals may switch to other, more dangerous weapons instead, and that criminals are more afraid of armed civilians than of being arrested by police. = Books & Monographs = * A Florida State of Mind: An Unnatural History of America's Weirdest State (St. Martin's Press, 2019) * Lost Souls: Manners and Morals in Contemporary American Society (Routledge, 2018) * Violence, Periodization and Definition of the Cultural Revolution: A Case Study of Two Deaths by the Red Guards (Brill, 2018, with Joshua Zhang) * Hunger in the Land of Plenty: A Critical Look at Food Insecurity (Lynne Rienner, 1018; with Amy M.

The episode was written by Sean Calder and was directed by Norberto Barba. Plot Opening quote: \\"And glory like the phoenix midst her fires, Exhales her odours, blazes, and expires.\\" Two young employees stay late at Harrison's Outfitters, when Damien Barso (Gideon Emery) uses a key to enter the building. He generates fire from his body and sets fire to the building. The two employees are trapped in the office and when they discover the fire, it is too late to escape. Nick, Hank and Wu are called in to investigate the deaths of the young folk. They meet John Harrison (John Murray), the owner of the store, and his son Andy (Hank Harris), whom John is grooming to take over the business, which has been in the family for three generations. Lt. Willis (Jessica Caesar), the arson investigator, draws their attention to the weird nature of the fire. It seemed to start with the breaker box, but instead of following the ventilation system, seemed to walk through the building, turning corners. The only time it behaved like a normal fire was when the young employees broke the window of the office in an attempt to escape, providing oxygen to the flames, which crisped them. Suspecting wesen involvement, Nick tasks Wu with looking for similar cases. He finds several and learns that they were being investigated by Bauerschwein arson investigator Lt. Peter Orson (Daniel Roebuck), whom Nick had put behind bars for murder in Season 1's fifth episode (The Three Bad Wolves). Visiting Orson in prison, Nick and Hank learn that Orson had actually seen the arsonist, but did not know his name. Orson convinces them to let him out (with tracking ankle bracelet) to help them. Adalind (Claire Coffee) is keen to visit Nick and Juliette to get her daughter back, but Prince Viktor (Alexis Denisof) counsels diplomacy. To illustrate his point, he introduces Adalind to Sam Damerov (Kenajuan Bentley), with whom Sean Reynard (Sasha Roiz) has entrusted the information that he has on Kelly Burkhardt's (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) whereabouts. Damerov reports the information to Viktor. Learning that the Harrison's business was facing Chapter 7 bankruptcy, Nick and Hank visit Charles Laney (Allen Galli), the Harrison's lawyer. After they have gone, Laney alerts Barso, telling him that the deaths of the young people has elevated the intensity of the investigation. He and Barso meet in Laney's car. Laney advises Barso to kill his client so that he cannot be identified. Barso responds by setting fire to Barso and steps out of the car, which explodes soon after. They learn that he is an excandesco through the trailer library, but the Grimm who wrote of an excandesco's role in the burning of Rome during Nero's reign was unsuccessful in his attempt to kill the excandesco responsible due to the extreme heat. Nick, Hank and Orson visit Rosalee (Bree Turner) and Munro (Silas Weir Mitchell) in the spice shop in the hope of finding a way to stop Barson. Munro is enraged by their bringing Orson with them, as Orson had killed his friend. Rosalee gets Munro to settle down, and he ultimately agrees to help. They decide that an ointment might be a way of stopping Barson. Rosalee and Munro set about making it in sufficient quantity. With Orson's help, Nick and Hank identify Barson and set about tracking him. In the meantime, we learn that Barso's last client was Andy Harrison, who does not want to take over a failing business from his father. Barso lures John Harrison to the burned store, pretending to be an arson investigator with news. When John Harrison turns up, he captures him and uses him as bait to get Andy to the store. Nick, Hank and Orson, on finding Laney's body, have decided that Barso is killing the people who can identify him. Rosalee and Munro have settled on large water guns as a means of delivering the ointment. Nick and Hank go to the Harrison house, thinking that John Harrison hired Barso and is therefore at risk, but they find Andy Harrison leaving to go to the store. He confesses that it was he, not his father, who engaged Barso and that it is he whom Barso wants to kill. Nick, Hank, Orson, Monroe and Rosalee, with Andy Harrison, converge on the store with the ointment-filled water guns. Orson volunteers to be bait to draw Barso away from John Harrison, whom Nick and Hank free. Then Barso, chasing Orson, exits the store to find himself surrounded. Unaware of the efficacy of their water guns, he woges to kill them, and they squirt the ointment over him, sealing him inside his own fire. He explodes. While this is happening, Adalind turns up at Nick and Juliette's house, and confronts Juliette. Juliette tells her to leave, but Adalind woges into her hexenbiest form. Juliette responds in kind, and the ensuing battle severely damages the furniture. Fearing for her life, Adalind flees and breaks down in her car. Nick comes home to find the mess and Juliette finally has the courage to show him that she is now a hexenbiest.

He can be no companion to any human being!\\" Nick (David Giuntoli) and Hank (Russell Hornsby) investigate the homicide of a cyclist named Zack found dead by a seemingly severe allergic reaction; they then meet an acquaintance of his, a 'Folterseele' (a golden/poison dart frog like wesen) named Bella Turner (Leah Renee) (inspired by the tale of The Frog Prince). According to Rosalee, Folterseele are a classically tragic - \\"always beautiful, always deadly\\" - type wesen, which are thankfully very rare as their skin secretes a highly poisonous deadly toxin poisonous touch which can kill, through no fault or intention of their own, with merely a single touch. They're also difficult to detect as they woge like no other Wesen, precipitated rather by sexual tension than emotion, usually via unwanted sexual advances. So, with help/advice from Rosalee & Monroe, Nick & Hank attempt to find a better solution rather than merely just locking her up. When a new member of the Royal family shows up in Portland, Captain Renard (Sasha Roiz) and Adalind (Claire Coffee) realize the Royal family have stepped up their efforts to find Diana.

A volatile Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch), conflicted by her new Hexenbiest state, threatens Renard that he best find a solution as she wants her life back. When she finally returns home, regardless of Nick's pleading to the contrary, she informs him she's moving out; seemingly still holding Nick partly responsible for her unwanted predicament. Later she ponders whether to embrace her new self or attempt to get rid of it. Bella Turner is attacked at her work place by another man from the cycling group. He also dies from her poison. She goes to her mother's house and hides in the barn. Her mother finds her and tries to comfort her. Inside the house her grandmother is heating up a branding iron. The mother and grandmother fight over the branding iron. The grandmother knocks the mother out. Nick and Hank arrive just in time to save Bella from having her face burned by her grandmother. They take Bella to the spice shop and offer her their cure for her toxin warning her that they don't know if it will work or what side effects it will have. She says it is better than never being able to touch someone who loves you, and drinks the potion. When Renard finally meets Kenneth he finds he's more than met his match. He forcefully informs Renard he's been tasked with finding his daughter, then threatens Renard that if he doesn't join forces he'll end up like his late friend Damerov - and the King minus another son.

The freshness of his wounds made Nick's thirst for revenge much more ruthless and with time that razor-sharp brutality should dull.

The episode was written by Michael Golamco and was directed by John Behring. Plot Opening quote: \\"Ah! It was colder than ice; it penetrated to his very heart.\\" Nick (David Giuntoli), Hank (Russell Hornsby), and Wu (Reggie Lee) are called to investigate a rare Wesen that leaves its victims dead from extreme hypothermia, frozen solid within just a matter of minutes. According to Rosalee they're called Varme Tyv (Norwegian for 'Heat Thief') - a Blue Racer (Coluber constrictor foxii) snake- like Wesen, which if/when away from their hibernacula during winter, can't survive without taking body heat from someone else. Since they lack the ability to create their own body heat, they too would freeze to death otherwise. Other sources of heat (such as fire or somesuch) would be useless for survival since their physiology can only process human body heat. If safely overwintered in their hibernacula, where they usually huddle for heat with their own kind, they're otherwise harmless, especially during summer or warm weather. Nick & co', after consequently finding further victims (three in all), they attempt to ascertain if they're after just one or more culprits. When they finally run down the main suspect to his hibernaculum, on attempting to disentangle him from the others, they inadvertently wake up the whole cluster of Varma Tyv, who had all been hibernating in a tangled, huddled heap in the centre of the heated underground cellar room. Startled out of hibernation, they defend themselves by attacking the intruding trio. Massively outnumbered, the trio attempt to flee back up and out. Just as they're about to be overpowered by the charging hoard, the now exposed and therefore increasingly incapacitated by the cold bunch, thankfully start to freeze before they can inflict much harm. Nick is however overcome with guilt, since according to their investigation only one of them was ever guilty of murder, Nick's unable to let the rest die when innocent of any crime. Nick decides they need to carry them all back inside, back into cozy hibernation, before they freeze to death. The guilty murderous one, however, is left to suffer the same fate he'd previously meted out to his victims. Meanwhile, Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) starts to feel that she is losing her humanity and attempts to seek help from Rosalee & Monroe. Angered by the fact that Nick had already disclosed her 'secret-Hexenbiest-state' to Hank, she fiercely woges, shocking them all, then leaves in a huff. Instead now intent on seeking revenge against Adalind (Claire Coffee). She pursuits Adalind when she's out shopping and overcome with vengeful emotions, telekinetically attempts to dislodge a large stone gargoyle off the side of a building onto her head, in the hopes she's crushed beneath. Adalind's alert 'bodyguard/jailer' saves her just in the nick of time, but not before Adalind is able to get a glimpse of Juliette reflected in the window before her. Now aware Juliette means to kill her and fearing for her life, she later begs new Royal Kenneth to avenge her before Juliette is able to strike again. Kenneth refuses, insisting they can instead use the situation to their advantage. Elsewhere, Captain Renard (Sasha Roiz) continues to suffer from mysterious bleeding and disturbing visions - where large disembodied black-taloned, red daemon-like claws, clutch at him; leaving him shaken and confused as he collapses. While elsewhere, Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) works toward coming to grips with the Wesenrein incident which still invades his mind and left him with somewhat PTSD-like symptoms and hand tremors which are foiling his much loved clock restoring endeavours. Ever sensitive Rosalee, first probes then comforts him, ensuring him their \\"clocks have been reset\\", so not to fear as they've yet much time left to continue enjoying their lives. As Nick returns to a dark and now empty-without-Juliette home, sad and lost in thought, he's suddenly overcome with visions of his aunt. He recalls words once told him that now seem far more prophetically charged : \\"The misfortune of our family is already passing on to you. I know you love Juliette, but you must end it and never see Juliette again.\\" ...

Plot Opening quote: \\"Hell is empty and all the devils are here.\\" Nick (David Giuntoli) arrives at the loft and talks with Adalind (Claire Coffee) about Renard's (Sasha Roiz) knowledge of Diana's (Hannah R. Loyd) danger. Adalind tells him that Diana is responsible for possessing Renard and killing Bonaparte and Rachel and they need to tell Renard about the tunnels. Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) and Rosalee (Bree Turner) return home and find the Hexenbiest book, marks on the mirror and Eve (Bitsie Tulloch) gone. They call Nick to help them find Eve, deducing she crossed the mirror and just then, the book magically locks itself and only Adalind can open it. Meanwhile, Eve wakes up in the other place which is a snowy land with no return to the mirror but discovers the same symbols. She wanders around and finds a man being chased by three Wesen, who kill him but two of them kill the other Wesen. Nick and Adalind arrive at Monroe's house with Diana and decide to use the stick as a way to enter. Nick enters using the stick but the stick remains behind as \\"it doesn't belong there\\". Nick enters the mirror to find that the land is a resemblance to the Schwarzwald (Black Forest). He is attacked by a Blutbad who he kills him with his gun. He finds Eve and then run from a group of Blutbaden. They finally reach a fort of humans, who eventually let them inside when they kill the Wesen but one of them flees. Nick and Eve show them the drawing of the skull creature, which the humans identity as \\"Zerst√∂rer\\". The fleeing Blutbad is then confronted by Zerst√∂rer. Meanwhile, Renard is called to help in finding more about the symbols in the cloth. He contacts Dasha (Alla Korot), who explains that the real world and the other place are different dimensions and that the place could be the afterlife. She then talks privately with Renard to explain that Diana may be the \\"Shaphat\\", and Zerst√∂rer could also be known as the Devil. There have been prophecies of the arrival of Zerst√∂rer and will make the Shaphat his bride and have a hundred children with her. After leaving the humans, Nick and Eve return to the stone pillars where they find the symbols carved into the pillar and the sky. They inspect the pillars and find that they may be in Zerst√∂rer's temple. The Blutbad returns and attacks Eve until Nick kills him. While discussing how to beat it, Zerst√∂rer appears and uses his staff to attack Nick and Eve. Nick uses the remaining bullets he has on him, with no success. Zerst√∂rer shows knowledge of Nick's Grimm powers and has his staff shine as Eve woges into her Hexenbiest form. Reception =Viewers= The episode was viewed by 3.96 million people, earning a 0.8/3 in the 18-49 rating demographics on the Nielson ratings scale, ranking third on its timeslot and sixth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Dr. Ken, Dateline NBC, Last Man Standing, Truth and Lies: The Family Manson, and an NCAA Tournament. This was a slight increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 3.95 million viewers with a 0.7/3. This means that 0.7 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 3 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. =Critical reviews= \\"Where the Wild Things Were\\" received positive reviews. Les Chappell from The A.V. Club wrote, \\"While there's a lot of things I liked in 'Where The Wild Things Were,' I found myself unable to embrace it as much as I wanted to with only three episodes left in the series' run. Part of it is a natural consequence of being a two-parter, but a bigger part is that it introduces an entire new world that there's not enough time to explore.\\" Kathleen Wiedel from TV Fanatic, gave a 3.2 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"While this episode wasn't terrible, it really amounted to a whole lot of exposition that should've already happened and an encounter with a big bad that could've been reached in the first five minutes. Really, though, the worst disappointment about this episode was the fact that the 'To Be Continued' title card didn't have any snarky commentary, as well!\\" Sara Netzley from EW gave the episode a \\"A-\\" rating and wrote, \\"When you step through a mirror into an unknown world, isn't it common courtesy to leave a note?

The riot began on June 4, 1977 and lasted a day and a half. Following the shooting deaths of two Puerto Rican men, locals (mostly young Puerto Ricans) battled Chicago police officers in Humboldt Park and in the streets surrounding. The riot led the community to hold the Division Street Puerto Rican Day Parade,Laviera, Jes√∫s Tato. \\"'77 PR Chicago Riot.\\" Afro-Hispanic Review, vol. 26, no. 2, 2007, pp. 145‚Äì183., www.jstor.org/stable/23054627. which started in 1978.  Background  West Town area of the city of Chicago, in the state of Illinois As a result of harsh conditions in Puerto Rico and incentives to come to mainland America, Puerto Rican migration to Chicago spiked during the 1950s and 60s.Cruz, Wilfredo (2004). Puerto Rican Chicago. Arcadia Publishing. p. 9. Puerto Rican communities in the city were then displaced by highway construction, urban renewal, and public housing projects. The Puerto Rican population moved from the Near West Side and the Near North Side to West Town and Humboldt Park, areas of white working-class neighborhoods, populated by European immigrants and their children. New Puerto Rican arrivals joined the new Puerto Rican enclaves in West Town and Humboldt Park.Fernandez, Lilia. Brown in the Windy City. University of Chicago Press, 2012. pp. 132‚Äì133. By 1960, 25% of the city's Puerto Rican population lived in West Town. Fernandez, Lilia. Brown in the Windy City. University of Chicago Press, 2012. p. 150. Most Puerto Ricans faced racial tensions with their white neighbors and especially with white authorities. They encountered police brutality, high unemployment, housing discrimination and poor housing conditions, and poverty. = 1966 Division St. Riots = Beginning on June 12, 1966, the Division Street riots affected the Humboldt Park area. Puerto Ricans were gathered in the streets, celebrating after a parade downtown.\\"Neighborhood fight ; Activists push to keep Puerto Rican pride alive in Humboldt Park\\". Chicago Tribune. June 12, 2006 ‚Äì via Proquest. The celebration was in honor of St. John the Baptist, after whom San Juan, Puerto Rico is named. In 1966, the parade for this celebration was officially renamed the Puerto Rican Parade. After a white police officer shot and wounded a young Puerto Rican man, a riot began and continued for three days, in spite of police efforts. The riot signified the difficult conditions Puerto Ricans faced in Chicago, including high unemployment, low income, racial discrimination, poor housing, and inadequate education.Padilla, Felix M. (1987). Puerto Rican Chicago. University of Notre Dame Press. pp. 145‚Äì147. In the aftermath of the riot, new community organizations and community leaders more actively engaged in city politics to work to improve conditions for Puerto Ricans in Chicago.Padilla, Felix M. (1987). Puerto Rican Chicago. University of Notre Dame Press. p. 155. According to a University of Chicago study, in the years following the 1966 riot, Puerto Ricans ranked police relations as their second biggest problem after unemployment. Although community members spent a decade working for better conditions, in 1977, Puerto Ricans in Chicago still faced myriad issues. They experienced displacement, housing discrimination, racism, unemployment, poor housing, poverty, and police brutality.Fernandez, Lilia. Brown in the Windy City. University of Chicago Press, 2012. p. 134. = FALN bombing = On June 4, 1977, several hours before the Humboldt Park riot, a bomb went off on the fifth floor of the Cook County Building, outside the offices of acting Mayor Michael Bilandic and George Dunne, the president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. No one was harmed, but the blast blew out windows and caused $6,000 in damages. FALN, a separatist group for Puerto Rican independence, claimed credit via a phone call to radio station WBBM-FM. The following year, the committee in charge of the Puerto Rican Parade moved the parade date to June 24 to avoid possible associations between June 4 bombings and the parade.  Riot  The details of the beginning of the riot are disputed. It began in Humboldt Park on June 4, 1977, after the Puerto Rican Day Parade. The festivities are misattributed in some print news as a celebration for \\"Puerto Rican Independence Day\\". Violence began around 6 o'clock in the evening and lasted until around midnight. The riot began in Humboldt Park itself, near the intersection of Division Street and California Avenue. According to the police, the violence began with gang-related shooting in the park. Police Superintendent James M. Rochford issued a nine-page report on June 14, 1977, which declared that seven other people in the park were hurt by gang gunfire before the police began shooting. The gangs in question were the rival Puerto Rican street gangs the Latin Kings and the Spanish Cobras. Sergeant Thomas Walton shot and killed Julio Osorio, 26. Rafael Cruz, 25, was also killed by a bullet from Sgt. Walton's gun. Preliminary autopsy reports showed both Osorio and Cruz were shot in the back. The family of Rafael Cruz recounted that Cruz came to Humboldt Park with his mother and brother, where they walked arm in arm. Later, Cruz was running out of the park, to a car where his niece was waiting, when police shot him in the back. According to the Chicago Tribune, on late Saturday afternoon, police arrived to Humboldt Park to break up gang- related fighting. When police were arresting one of the combatants, the young man resisted, and \\"picnickers became angry and began hurling objects.\\" The New York Times printed that following the shooting of Osorio and Cruz, the police tried to close the park and \\"were met with a barrage of bricks, bottles, stones, sticks and chairs, but Hispanic witnesses charged that policemen stormed the park with nightsticks and attacked many picnickers, including families with children.\\" The account continues to state that the riot escalated because police were outnumbered (Chicago police officers were stationed in large numbers at Soldier Field for a rock concert that day). Another account describes police arriving to respond to reports of gang activity in part of Humboldt Park, to find a park full of Spanish-speaking people congregating. The presence of police, and perhaps some provocation by police, started the riot. During the first day of the riot, two people were killed (Osorio and Cruz), approximately 3,000 people were involved, 116 people were injured, 119 were arrested, and 38 police officers and 3 firefighters were injured. Rioters threw rocks, bottles, and Molotov cocktails. The police department reported that 17 police cars and trucks were damaged during the riot. One police officer was seen setting fire to a fallen Puerto Rican flag, waving the burning flag, and stepping on it.\\"1977 Division Street Riots\\", Que Ondee Sola. Vol. 35 No. 4, April‚ÄìMay 2007. Northeastern Illinois University. via Harold Washington Library Special Collections. p. 4. Acting Mayor Bilandic came to Humboldt Park and the riot area for about 15 minutes after the violence died down, late Saturday night. Police helicopters hovered over the Division Street area during the riot. Approximately 200 police officers in riot gear, some on horseback, worked to clear the streets. However, as soon as the police moved on to another area, the crowd would return. On Sunday morning, police set up a command post in the park as firefighters and public works crews cleaned the area. The buildup of police and the activity drew a crowd of hundreds of people, mostly young. Minor vandalism and looting began in the afternoon, and police asked bars and businesses to close. Rioters threw rocks, bottles, and Molotov cocktails for the second night in a row. Official cleanup of the park began on Monday, and three civilian cars were removed from the lagoon. = Car chase with the police = During the riot on Sunday night, 23-year-old Luis Velasquez ran down police Sergeant William Diaz. Velasquez drove off, and engaged in a chase with the police that reached speeds of 80 m.p.h. Velasquez was arrested and charged with two counts of attempted murder, aggravated battery, reckless driving, resisting arrest, and possession of controlled substances. = Fires = According to a witness, by evening, the police closed off the streets surrounding Division and California. People ran through this area to avoid confrontation with the police. Others were scared, as a building fires burned, while the fire department did not respond or work to control the blaze. Official accounts explain that firefighters were not sent in to control the fires because the police could not guarantee their safety. These fires left 15 families homeless. Four days after the riot, the body of Domingo Torres Claudio, 62, was found in the rubble of the grocery store below the apartment where he lived. On Saturday night, rioters looted the grocery store, then started a fire. When the fire department came, rioters shot at the firefighters. The building burned while the police and fire departments regrouped. Claudio was a retired factory worker and lived alone.  Aftermath  The police response to the riot constituted much of the controversy in its aftermath. Following the 1968 Chicago riots, John S. Boyle, Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County, handed down orders for \\"mass arrests\\", when 50 or more people are arrested at one incident. Although these orders were still in place, and over 100 people were arrested on the night of June 4, mass arrest protocol was not followed. As a result, there were no interpreters, the people arrested at the riot were unable to contact their families, get medical attention, or meet with attorneys one-on-one. Some community members reported that some of those arrested were held overnight in police vehicles. Nearly half of those arrested on the first night still had not made bond by the time of their hearings. The Cook County Special Bail Project Inc., a local group that helped disadvantaged defendants obtain release from jail on bail, prepared a report that charged that the failure of police to call for mass arrest procedures constituted a violation of rights. The chief of the Chicago Police Department's patrol division, John McInerney, said that he made a judgement to not call for a mass arrest court, because he felt the defendants from the riot could be processed normally. Processing the arrests took between 13 and 19 hours to complete. After the riot, police Superintendent Rochford issued a gag order, preventing police officers from discussing the events in Humboldt Park.Humboldt pk.--troubled 'island' without clout. (June 12, 1977). Chicago Tribune ‚Äì via Proquest. Members of neighborhood gangs complained of police harassment after the riot. The increased, confrontational policing maintained the tense conditions that led to the riot. Some records show that more Puerto Ricans were being arrested after the weekend of June 4. A week after the riot, to protest against police harassment, Puerto Rican community members held a march from the riot area to the Daley Center, where they held a rally. About 300 people marched, and Maria Cruz, sister of the late Rafael Cruz, and Jenny Osorio, sister of the late Julio Osorio, both spoke at the rally. In the week following the riot, community members of Humboldt Park met with mayor Bilandic to discuss the weekend's riot. After waiting three hours, the Humboldt Park residents had 20 minutes with the mayor. Puerto Rican community leaders also met with Chicago police officials and Department of Human Services officials for two hours, and expressed their concerns about the community. The city government's only direct response to the riot was a grant of $471,000 to fund community service jobs. Mayor Bilandic appointed deputy commissioner Hugh Osborne and Deputy Police Superintendent Samuel Nolan to represent the city in meetings with Latino community groups, following the riots. Osborne and Nolan fielded the concerns and demands of Puerto Rican community leaders on behalf of the city. Among these demands were more summer jobs in the West Town community, which were initially cut back in the budget. On July 25, 1979, U.S. Attorney Thomas P. Sullivan announced that no police officers would be prosecuted for the shootings of Osorio and Cruz. After a two-year investigation, Sullivan said that there was not sufficient evidence to establish \\"willful intent\\" in the shootings. A federal grand jury was convened, but no indictments were sought. The families of the men killed filed civil damage suits against the policemen involved. While the 1966 Division Street riots were seen as a turning point in Puerto Rican community action, according to community leader Rev. Jorge Morales, the Humboldt Park riot made the community more apathetic about civic involvement. The increased media attention and coverage of Puerto Rican community issues following the riot did not result in changes or improvements. Michael Rodr√≠guez Mu√±iz, on the other hand, argued years later that the aftermath of the riot created \\"a radical consciousness\\" among Puerto Ricans in Chicago.

His entrance heralded by a flock of dead bats, diving through a mirror in Olympic style, human beings swatted away as if they were less than said bats, a flood of terrifying analogies in the Grimm diaries, Diana genuinely terrified for the first time in her young life: the sense of dread and impossible odds builds well over the episode‚Äôs run time.\\" Kathleen Wiedel from TV Fanatic was more critical of the episode, giving it a 1.5 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"It was understandable in the sense that the series is at an end, drama, loss, high stakes, and so on, but it just felt so sudden and pointless due to the lack of intelligent behavior earlier in the episode.

The episode was written by series co-creators David Greenwalt and Jim Kouf and was directed by Greenwalt. The show centers on Nick Burkhardt (David Giuntoli), a Portland Police Department homicide detective who discovers that he is the last descendant of a group of guardians named \\"Grimms\\" who had to protect the world from a group of Wesen, mythical creatures which only the Grimms can see. He is aided by his partner Hank Griffin (Russell Hornsby) and a Wesen named Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) to solve cases related to the Wesen and stop them from causing an uprising in the human world. Throughout the course of the show, Nick has faced terrorist Wesen organizations such as the Verrat, the Royal Family, the Wesenrein and Black Claw which sought to invoke a greater power of Wesen over humans on Earth. His fight against the Wesen has also caused consequences to his life. In the final episode, Nick along with his friends seeks to destroy Zerst√∂rer, who plans on taking Diana and Kelly for his purposes. The finale received a mostly positive reception from both critics and fans who praised the conclusion of the storylines and David Giuntoli's performance in the episode. While some thought the finale was rushed, they concluded that the series got a \\"satisfying\\" ending to the show. Plot Opening quote: \\"Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.\\" Nick (David Giuntoli) regains consciousness and finds Zerst√∂rer gone. He tries to revive Hank (Russell Hornsby) and Wu (Reggie Lee) with the stick but it doesn't work. Trubel (Jacqueline Toboni) arrives and finds the precinct filled with dead officers. Deducing that bullets cannot work, they decide they have to cut his head in order to kill him permanently. He warns Adalind (Claire Coffee) and Renard (Sasha Roiz) about it but they tell him that Zerst√∂rer not only wants Diana (Hannah R. Loyd), he also wants Kelly. Nick leaves but sends Trubel to the cabin to protect them. Meanwhile, in the spice shop, Eve (Bitsie Tulloch), Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) and Rosalee (Bree Turner) do research to find a way to kill Zerst√∂rer. They find that \\"one's blood\\" may be enough to kill him and Rosalee begins developing a potion named \\"Force Du Sang\\", requiring the blood of three opposed forces: a Grimm, a Wesen and a Hexenbiest. Nick arrives at the spice shop to inform them of Hank's and Wu's deaths. After Monroe and Rosalee leave for the cabin, Nick and Eve are attacked by Zerst√∂rer (Wil Traval), who uses his staff to make Eve stab herself, killing her. Zerst√∂rer disappears before Nick suffers a breakdown. Nick eventually arrives at the cabin where he, Adalind and Monroe put their blood in a bowl for the potion. Diana appears and announces that Zerst√∂rer will arrive as Nick's stick reveals his location, intending to retrieve it. Zerst√∂rer arrives and Diana willingly goes with him. Renard attacks him but he's no match for Zerst√∂rer, who stabs him in the heart with the staff, killing him. Monroe throws the potion on Zerst√∂rer, making him suffer a breakdown but the effects soon disappear, finding that there's nothing that can kill it. Adalind tries to kill him with an ax but he takes it and kills her with a slash to the chest. He then has his staff shift into a snake that bites Rosalee and Monroe, killing them too. Zerst√∂rer leaves, leaving Nick to cope with his losses. He uses his staff to strangle Trubel before Nick arrives. Zerst√∂rer states that he only needs the stick and in exchange for the stick, he will bring back those who died, proving it by resurrecting Trubel. Nick decides to give him the stick but Trubel takes it and runs into the woods. Nick intercepts her and they get into a fight until Nick beats her and takes the stick. He is then haunted by voices inside his head until his mother Kelly (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and Aunt Marie (Kate Burton) appear. Against his wishes, both of them stop Nick from going and inform him that what he needs is his ancestors' strength to battle Zerst√∂rer. Nick, Kelly, Trubel and Marie then join and attack Zerst√∂rer, managing to cut one of his arms. Nick then takes the staff, which unites itself with the stick and stabs Zerst√∂rer in the chest, effectively killing him. Kelly and Marie explain that they are all descendants from the First Grimm and disappear (confirming that this was all in Nick's head). However, Diana appears and reveals that she managed to see Kelly and Marie. Just then, Zerst√∂rer's body disintegrates and his remains create a portal and begins to suck the staff within. Nick refuses to let go of the staff and is sucked into the portal. Nick is hurled into the scene where he and Eve returned from the Other Place in Monroe's house with everybody alive. Diana then tells Nick that Zerst√∂rer is dead and as such, they are all safe. After greeting everyone, they discover that the staff also passed through the portal. A narration reveals that Nick did not know what to say and Zerst√∂rer never entered the world. 20 years later, in a modernized trailer, a person narrates how Nick managed to defeat him with his blood, and the ones from Kelly, Marie and Trubel, who is also revealed to be his third cousin on his mother's side. He concludes by saying, \\"Some will say it's just a myth, legend or fairy tale but I know it's true because my father told me so\\", revealing to be a grown-up Kelly Burkhardt (Kevin Joy). He is then joined by a grown-up Diana (Nicole Steinwedell), who grabs the Zerst√∂rer's staff and tells him to get ready to hunt Wesen with their parents as well as Monroe's and Rosalee's triplets. While Kelly leaves, Diana stares for a minute on the Grimm diaries before showing her purple eyes. This causes the book to close with its cover showing a big \\"G\\". The series ends with the words, \\"The End\\" followed by \\"Thank You\\" translated in many languages. Production =Development= On April 5, 2016, Grimm was renewed for a sixth season by NBC, despite decreasing ratings and being \\"on the bubble\\" for 2 months. However, a few weeks later, the network announced that the season would be cut from its usual 22 episodes format to just 13 episodes with possible midseason premiere although the network have commented that they have the option to increase the number of episodes. Later, when NBC unveiled its fall schedule for the 2016-17 television schedule, Grimm was given the 9:00 p.m. at Fridays timeslot but no premiere date was announced. This, along with the continuing decreasing ratings of the second half of the fifth season prompted analysts to question if the sixth season could be its last although co-creators David Greenwalt and Jim Kouf have stated that they weren't sure if the season would be its last. Finally, on August 29, 2016, NBC officially announced that the sixth season would be the last of the series and that the premiere date would be at January 6, 2017 an hour earlier than the given 9:00 p.m. timeslot with uninterrupted episodes and the finale set to be broadcast on March 31, 2017. The writers commented on the final season, \\"The fact that we got this concept going and we were able to actually explore all these psychological motivations dealing with history, mythology and fairy tales and dealing with religion and belief and all those things that you can't do on a regular show, and just have it come full circle, which you'll see in the end of the season, I think that's the most satisfying thing. Somehow we just kind of pulled it off for a whole 123 episodes with an arc that makes sense.\\" On December 2016, it was revealed on a tweet that the final episode would be titled, \\"The End\\" and would be written by series co-creators David Greenwalt and Jim Kouf and directed by Greenwalt. =Writing= Before the sixth season was announced, Giuntoli expressed his hopes for the finale, \\"If we get a Season 6, it could very well be our last season, and it will be the first time that the writers would get to write to an ending. If we do, it'll be a very fun ride, with major events.\\" David Giuntoli said that the finale \\"will be a satisfying ending for fans.\\" Giuntoli claimed that the series finale \\"Was a satisfying ending to read. I think it will be a satisfying ending for fans.\\" Giuntoli also added that the finale would feature a time jump. For her part, Bitsie Tulloch mentioned that the themes of the finale were \\"Family, loyalty, revenge, forgiveness. Because it's the final season you see many loose ends being tied up.\\" She also added that \\"I think people will like the way it ends. It's a mostly happy ending (it can't be completely happy -- it is Grimm after all). There are a few things that are slightly open-ended, so it feels like everyone wins.\\" Co-creators Greenwalt and Kouf discussed that they wrote everyone's deaths to show Nick at his worst moment, \\"That's the logic of it. Because if you're fighting great evil and great evil wants something that is going to destroy the world and he's got to convince you that it's worth it to give this to him so he can destroy the world, you've got to take a lot away from [Nick].\\" They also explained, \\"And Nick was ready to make that Devil's bargain, too, to have his loved ones back, until he had a somewhat supernatural experience of the strength of his blood and his ancestors who came before him, and then naturally who would come after him. I mean, just imagine if we had just killed everybody and he just walks off to the drug store! Everyone would have had a big fit.\\" They also explained, \\"The point was not to have a lethal ending or a happily-ever-after ending, the point was to take Nick to the lowest possible point he could be, where he thought he could not possibly dig any deeper inside. And he was willing to give up the world so that he could have his loved ones, as anyone would do in that position. But then kind of mystically, and kind of not mystically, his ancestors appeared to him, and he found a deeper strength than he even knew he had. And that was really the theme, his deepening purpose as a post-modern Grimm.\\" They also added that they were planning on bringing more previous cast members, among them Danny Bruno as Bud Wurstner but time constraints forced them to stop it from happening. The surprise addition of Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Kate Burton was easy to get and they were given two days to film their scenes. However, a snowstorm in Portland delayed the production five days and left the actresses with just one day to film the scenes. About the time jump 20 years later, Greenwalt and Kouf stated that everyone is \\"all just one big, happy family, fighting evil monsters\\" with Trubel \\"definitely out there.\\" Greenwalt said, \\"That's the big question: what did happen to Diana and Kelly? And we also always had the image of the book itself closing, and that being the final image, except for saying 'thank you' to the fans. Then to go not only full circle in terms of a myth/legend/fairy tale but actually go out to the future and have a guy say, 'What you've been seeing is all true. I know it happened because my father told me,' that always struck me as really strong, kind of an oral history and written history of these kinds of tales.\\" Regarding a spin-off or anything related to the scenes, Kouf said, \\"We always thought it was a fairytale ending, and fairytales don't seem to end. They don't go away, they're always with us and they keep going on, so what a perfect way to end this type of series with a new beginning.\\" Regarding the fans' efforts to save the show through many petitions on Change.org, Kouf commented \\"I think the fans are fantastic for doing that. It just shows you how much they love the show. I think it's great, who knows what'll happen, but it's hard to consider something that nobody has put in front of us.\\" Greenwalt, for his part, said, \\"We so appreciate the broad reach of this kind of storytelling. There's something universal about all of this worldwide, and we're so grateful that people connected with the show, and we thank them for that because without that we wouldn't be doing it. He also said, \\"you never know.\\" Reception =Viewers= =Critical reviews= \\"The End\\" received positive reviews. Terri Schwartz from IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8.0 rating out of 10 and wrote in her verdict, \\"Grimm offered up a satisfying series finale that successfully brought the show to a close. Nick's journey as a Grimm felt like it was given its proper due, and the episode both had stakes while also delivering a happy ending. The jump forward in time at the end was particularly successful, promising that the fairy tale continues on even if we aren't watching it.\\" Les Chappell from The A.V. Club gave the episode an \\"A-\\" rating and wrote, \\"'The End' is a series finale that definitely has that mood of a last go-around to it, the feeling that there's nothing to be gained by holding back. A literal devil walking the earth for ultimate power, a nigh nuclear poison to be brewed that takes all their combined talents, and the intervention of Grimms from beyond the grave ‚Äî all of it is on display here. Even though there are some quibbles, they're quibbles that are as much a part of the Grimm experience as the witticisms and monsters.\\" Sara Netzley from EW gave the episode a \\"A\\" rating and wrote, \\"'Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.' These words open the final episode of the little fairy tale show that could. And at first, they seem cruelly ironic, as nothing about the Zerst√∂rer's staff is a comfort to Nick, who endures losses that almost break him. Thankfully, that comfort isn't an empty promise, and Grimm closes its six-season run with a reminder that it's the people we love who give us our strength.\\" Kevin Yeoman from Screen Rant, wrote, \\"There's an It's A Wonderful Life quality to Grimms final few moments (before an obligatory time jump reveals that Nick's son Kelly and Diana are carrying on the family tradition 20 years in the future) that brings everyone back to life, but robs the finale of some of its dramatic power. But while wiping out nearly every character on the show would have been a memorably bleak way to end things, Grimm seeks to imbue the finale with emotional weight by applying the tried and true formula of the importance of family. Whether or not that undercuts what was building up to be a remarkably violent and somber end will likely depend on how much mileage you get from the idea of ghosts returning to help the living in their time of need. In the end, it works as an appropriate narrative loophole affording the series the chance to reminisce about its television journey while also playing with (though not fully committing to) the idea of truly bringing things to an end. With that, Grimm signs off for the last time.\\" Kevin Yeoman from Oregon Live, wrote, \\"As 'Grimm' reminded us, before Walt Disney and other family friendly folk got their hands on the Brothers Grimm stories, they were often as dark as the Black Forest, with monsters preying on innocent victims, until the happy ending -- we hoped -- restored order. It was fitting, then, that the 'Grimm' series finale, appropriately titled 'The End,' sent Nick through a nightmarish journey, before closing the book with an ending that evoked both fairy tales and the show's own mythology.\\" Not all reviews were positive. Kathleen Wiedel from TV Fanatic was more critical of the finale, giving it a 2.5 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"Not. Gonna. Stick. The whole plotline with Zerst√∂rer annoyed me from the outset, but as I noted in the review for Grimm Season 6 Episode 12, it was really the stupid choices made by normally-intelligent characters that galled me the most. This time around, we not only got poor decision-making skills but also some of the most head-scratching moments of deus ex machina I've seen the entire series!\\" =Accolades= TVLine named Giuntoli the \\"Performer of the Week\\" for the week of April 1, 2017, for his performance in the finale. The site wrote, \\"'The End' is a fitting finish for NBC's fairytale series, and Giuntoli's performance is a crowning glory for his time on the show.\\" References External links 2017 American television episodes Grimm (season 6) episodes American television series finales ","title":"The End (Grimm)"},{"id":"53485920","text":"Lucien Theodore De Roeck (9 March 1915 in Dendermonde ‚Äì 5 March 2002 in Elsene) was a Belgian drawing artist, type designer, typographer and graphic designer. He is best known for the design of Expo 58, the Brussels World's Fair in 1958.  Early Life and Interests  Lucien De Roeck was born in Dendermonde. When he was 5, the family moved to Elsene, near Brussels. De Roeck was born to draw. From his earliest memories on he remembered himself drawing. He always had a sketchbook and a pencil on hand. For the rest of his life, De Roeck drew at least 10 minutes every day. All of his sketches and drawings have been captured in over 400 sketchbooks. Dendermonde is situated next to the river the Scheldt. From a very young age until his death he was fascinated by the stream and had a special connection with it. He spent a lot of his time watching and drawing the boats on the Scheldt. The port of Antwerp, located next to the Scheldt, was a great subject of his drawings as well. When De Roeck was 15, he started being more serious about drawing. The place where you could find him drawing the most was on the tram on his way to school where he documented the passengers. At that time, he decided to take evening classes in drawing.  Education  At the age of 17, in 1932, De Roeck enrolled in La Cambre which is a notorious art school in Brussels. They had a very modernist way of teaching inspired by Bauhaus. His teachers of the evening classes had a liberal approach. This made De Roeck opt for the rather socialist and progressive La Cambre, unlike his traditional Flemish education in high school. De Roeck had a strong affinity for architecture, but due to limited financial possibilities he chose to study the shorter program Advertising Design. This separate program was exclusive at La Cambre, it wasn't taught at Bauhaus. He had the atelier Advertising Design by Joris Minne. Nand Geersen instructed the course Book Design. He graduated with great honors in 1935 and thought this grade was too high, which showed his great modesty. The modernist mind-set of La Cambre was brought by Henry van de Velde, the headmaster at that time. He set the example for De Roeck. Van de Velde taught him to simplify the complexity of a subject by reducing and erasing redundant elements and only keeping the essential. De Roeck lived by this idea of a versatile synthesis guided by a clear opinion. Keeping your curiosity was also taught by van de Velde and De Roeck admired this quality. The knowledge and minds-set he learned in La Cambre, he would later transfer to his future students. As well as the idea that learning is endeavoring, editing and critically reviewing. After serving his military service in 1935 he took an extra year to experiment with typography at La Cambre as well. In 1939 De Roeck decided to take a course in calligraphy at the London Royal College of Art. This ended abruptly. He was called for duty in May 1940 to fight the Battle of the Lys.  Career  In 1935, De Roeck and his fellow students were asked by the mayor of Antwerp Camille Huysmans to design a poster which would serve as an advertisement for Antwerp. For sketching he went back to his beloved Scheldt to draw the small boats and huge ships. The iconography and composition of the final poster had influences from A.M Cassandre and Leo Marfurt. De Roeck won the assignment and over 10.000 copies were made. There was a second edition in 1936. After, a second design brief was assigned to the class. This time it was to promote the ferry connection Ostend-Dover. De Roeck wonoas the best design for this assignment. In 1941 there was a lawsuit in which De Roeck was accused of the illicit use of the font Peignot designed by Cassandre in his poster for an international dance contest. This incident made Lucien focus more on the specialization of letter shapes. He had already developed a strong affinity for type design in the 1930s. Specialization would guarantee De Roeck security and avoid future similar incidents. The first big assignment he had after his studies and military service, was in 1937 by Yves Denis, the director of the Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels. De Roeck was asked to do the lay-out of their newspaper they published every month, the Journal des Beaux-Arts. In 1941 De Roeck pursued teaching which turned out to be his second nature after drawing. He started teaching typography at La Cambre. Later in Ecole des Filles de Marie (later Sint-Lucas paviljoen and now Karel de Grote-Hogeschool) in Antwerp, the provincial college in Saint-Ghislain and evening schools and Brussels as well. It wasn't until 1980 that De Roeck decided to retire. After his retirement he spent an extra year at La Cambre to do an unpaid internship in teaching. Students of his are amongst others Pierre Alechinsky, Michel Olyff and Jean- Michel Folon. De Roeck became in 1946 a staff member of the Book Museum in Brussels. He organized exhibitions about typography and book printing. In 1969 he became a member of ATypI and in 1958 he took part for the first time in the L‚Äôassociation des Rencontres internationales de Lure. = Wartime = During the Battle of the Lys, De Roeck kept an autobiographical sketchbook. He fought back with drawings. These are a series of cubist drawings with elements such as soldiers, airplanes and explosions which summed up what he had experienced. Afterwards he was taken to a German detention camp and was freed end 1940. As much as he wanted to make a name for his himself after he graduated, the circumstances weren't good. Because of the war, designing wasn't always possible. This was a major setback for the beginning career of De Roeck. He had to earn money as a house painter. When he had a commission, usually for posters, the design was frugal. He used simple typography and little color. He would also design infographics for the Belgian newspapers with information on the movements of the Allied armies. Paper was scares during wartime, which forced De Roeck to take other surfaces to draw on. He had to settle for smaller pieces of paper, a piece of tablecloth or found cardboard. All of this was still enough to satisfy his craving for drawing. = Freedom of the Press = After the Second World War ended, the press got its freedom back. This resulted in the flourishing of the Belgian press. From 1944 De Roeck designed for La Lanterne. He provided a revival of Le Phare with his talents as typographer and illustrator and launched their new Sunday magazine. He also designed for La Cit√© and Le Quotidian. For the paper Pan he reviewed theatre plays in images. The narration would adapt to the overall feel of the plays. = Expo 58 = De Roeck experienced the peak of his career during the 1950s. In 1954 he won the design competition for the poster of the World Fair of 1958. He used an asymmetrical star in the center of the design, combined with a globe in the right upper corner. The star has the city hall of Brussels in the middle. The five points stand for the visitors of the 5 continents Brussels would welcome, as well as the number of decennia Congo was a colony of Belgium. The typography exists of ‚ÄòBrussels‚Äô and ‚Äò58‚Äô and the colors used are blue and green which suggest heaven and earth. In the expo itself, De Roeck enlarged the star and built luminescent 3D versions, used to decorate a footbridge with a view over several pavilions. De Roeck received in 1960 an honorary badge as knight for the realization and success of Expo 58 from the Order of Leopold II. In 1966 he got one from the Order of Leopold. = After the 1950s = In the 1960s the International Typographic Style advanced and from 1980 the digital revolution took off. This all didn't have much grip on De Roeck. He renewed himself but remained true to his own style.  Work Process and Aesthetics  At the start of designing a poster, the sketching phase was the most important. De Roeck developed an idea which was sometimes better than the final product. He occasionally complained to his students that when he showed designs to his clients, they would have remarks on the composition or color. They often wanted details from one sketch combined with another and this led to half-hearted design he said. For his earliest posters, created in the thirties, he used the diagonal axis of view, typical for the idiom of that time. He also created a dynamic rhythm between text and image. He pleaded for a direct approach, a clear transmission of language on a subject that looked simple at first sight. In order to reach this, the only way was to analyze the basic elements that gave the outcome the most suitable look. The function determined the form, but he combined this with elegance. He never got rid of these ideas. Because De Roeck had a great fondness for architecture, he worked with high precision. This was convenient when designing plans, decors and scale models. De Roeck worked in 1959 on a mobile panorama sight of Brussels in perspective and relief, commissioned by the Commissariat of Tourism. He painted large pieces of fabric with the images of Brussels buildings.  Personal life  Lucien De Roeck married in 1941 to Adrienne van Emden. She studied at La Cambre as well and had a degree in weaving. His daughter Anne and his son Michel were born in 1944 and 1945. As a family they moved a few times, but stayed within the city of Elsene. As an homage to his children he would sometimes use their names as his pseudonym. Under the pseudonym Luc Doek, De Roeck made a comic named Jef Klawieter. Later, influenced by Jij√©, who he met in La Cambre, he drew Gibou. But soon after de Roeck realized that comic books aren't something for him, he had a more spontaneous way of sketching and drawing. He was friends with other comic artists Herg√©, Edgar P. Jacobs and Andr√© Franquin and made intimate portraits of them. He had the rare ability of capturing the fleeting of a model. Sometimes he wouldn't even lift his pencil from the paper. For New Year's he sent them greeting cards decorated with lyrical typography. At his death the Fonds Lucien De Roeck was created as an archive of his work.

An osteolytic lesion (from the Greek words for \\"bone\\" (·ΩÄœÉœÑŒ≠ŒøŒΩ), and \\"to unbind\\" (ŒªœçŒµŒπŒΩ)) is a softened section of a patient's bone formed as a symptom of specific diseases, including breast cancer and multiple myeloma. This softened area appears as a hole on X-ray scans due to decreased bone density, although many other diseases are associated with this symptom. Osteolytic lesions can cause pain, increased risk of bone fracture, and spinal cord compression. These lesions can be treated using biophosphonates or radiation, though new solutions are being tested in clinical trials. Cellular causes Bone lesions are caused by an imbalance of regulatory factors, characterized by an increased depletion and resorption of old bone tissue and a decrease in bone rebuilding, known as bone remodeling. This imbalance is due to a flooding of regulatory factors released by specific tumors, thus overwhelming the tissue repair system and resulting in these lesions. The over-activity of osteoclasts can also cause hypercalcemia, which can cause damage to the kidneys and requires additional medication and monitoring. In multiple myeloma, an increased number of myeloma cells block osteoblasts from creating new bone, while these cancerous cells also release factors that cause an upregulation on osteoclasts, causing an increasing in bone tissue resorption and an overall breakdown of bone integrity. This breakdown often begins in the bone marrow near tumor sites and spreads outward to the surface of the implicated bone. The most common cancers that metastasize to form osteolytic lesions are thyroid, lung, kidney, gastrointestinal, malignant melanoma and breast, though any cancer can cause bone lesions. Lesions are most often found in larger bones, such as the skull, pelvis, radius, and femur. Potential treatments =Biophosphonates= Biophosphonates are drugs that are used to prevent bone mass loss and are often used to treat osteolytic lesions. Zoledronic acid (Reclast) is a specific drug given to cancer patients to prevent the worsening of bone lesions and has been reported to have anti-tumor effects as well. Zoledronic acid has been clinically tested in conjunction with calcium and vitamin D to encourage bone health. Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody treatment RANKl inhibitor that targets the osteocyte apoptosis regualtory RANKL gene, is also prescribed to prevent bone metastases and bone lesions. Most biophosphonates are co-prescribed with disease-specific treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation for cancer patients. =Radiation= Bone lesions in multiple myeloma patients may be treated with low-dose radiation therapy in order to reduce pain and other symptoms. Used in combination with immunochemotherapy, radiation therapy can be used to treat certain cancers when aimed at areas of bone lesion and softened bone.

Norway Norway years Norwegian music-related lists ","title":"List of years in Norwegian music"},{"id":"53486009","text":"Altior (foaled 6 May 2010) is an Irish-bred British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse who competes in National Hunt races. After winning one of his three National Hunt Flat races he was unbeaten in five hurdle races including the Sharp Novices' Hurdle and Supreme Novices' Hurdle. In the 2016/2017 National Hunt season he won six consecutive steeplechases including the Henry VIII Novices' Chase, Wayward Lad Novices' Chase, Game Spirit Chase, Arkle Challenge Trophy and the Celebration Chase. Background Altior (Latin for \\"Higher\\") is a bay gelding with a white star bred in Ireland by Paddy Behan. In June 2013 the three-year-old gelding was auctioned at the Goffs National Hunt sale and was bought for ‚Ç¨60,000 by Highflyer Bloodstock. He entered the ownership of Patricia Pugh and was sent into training with Nicky Henderson at Upper Lambourn in Berkshire. Altior's sire High Chaparral won The Derby in 2002 and the Breeders' Cup Turf in 2002 and 2003. His other progeny included So You Think, Dundeel, Free Eagle and Toronado. His dam Monte Solaro won two National Hunt races and has produced several other winners. She was a distant female line descendant of the influential French broodmare Democratie. Racing career =2014-2015: National Hunt Flat races= Altior began his racing career in a National Hunt Flat race at Market Rasen Racecourse on 18 May in which he started the 4/6 favourite in a seven-runner field. Ridden by Nico de Boinville he led from the start and won in \\"impressive\\" style by fourteen lengths. After an absence of nearly nine months the gelding returned in a Listed National Hunt Flat race at Newbury Racecourse in which he started favourite and finished third behind Barters Hill and Buveur d'Air (also trained by Henderson). He was then sent to Ireland for the Grade 1 Champion INH Flat Race at Punchestown on 29 April and finished sixth of the thirteen runner behind Bellshill. =2015/2016 season: Novice hurdles= In the 2015/2016 National Hunt season Altior was campaigned in novice hurdle races. He made his debut over obstacles at Chepstow Racecourse on 10 October and won by thirty-four lengths from Murray Mount. Three weeks later he won at Ascot Racecourse beating Ch'Tibello by one and a quarter lengths despite making a bad mistake at the final flight of hurdles. On 15 November Altior was moved up in class for the Grade 2 Sharp Novices' Hurdle at Cheltenham Racecourse and started the 2/1 favourite. After racing in second place he took the lead at the second last and held off a strong challenge from Maputo to win by half a length. On 26 December he won again, taking a novice hurdle at Kempton Park Racecourse by thirteen lengths from the Willie Mullins-trained Open Eagle. On 15 March 2016 Altior made his first appearance at the Cheltenham Festival when he was one of fourteen horses to contest the Supreme Novices' Hurdle and started the 4/1 second favourite behind Min, an Irish gelding who had won the Moscow Flyer Novice Hurdle on his last start. The other runners included Buveur d'Air, Bellshill, Charbel and Petit Mouchoir. After racing in mid- division, he began to make progress after the fifth of the eight hurdles and took the lead approaching the final obstacle. He accelerated away from his rivals to win by seven lengths from Min, with his stablemate Buveur d'Air taking third place. After the race Henderson said \\"He always looked to be in the right place, Nico gave him a great ride. I was always happy and he's very good. He and Buveur D'Air have both run cracking races\\" while de Boinville commented \\"I was seriously impressed... We know he stays and that's what he did. I think he outstayed them.\\" =2016/2017 season: novice steeplechases= The 2016/2017 National Hunt season saw Altior competing in novice chases starting with the Starlight Novice's Chase at Kempton on 21 November which he won by sixty-three lengths at odds of 2/13. Henderson commented that he had been considering aiming the horse at the Champion Hurdle and added \\"he's got serious pace. You could win a Flat race with Altior any day you like\\". Two weeks later he started at odds of 2/7 when he was moved up in class for the Grade 1 Henry VIII Novices' Chase at Sandown Park. After racing in third place, he took the lead after jumping the final fence and \\"sprinted clear\\" to in by four lengths from Charbel. His rider Noel Fehily said \\"I was most impressed with him going to the last, I was a length down, he winged it and in two strides he was three lengths clear. I thought it was very impressive\\". The Grade 2 Wayward Lad Novices' Chase at Kempton saw Altior start at odds of 1/9 against three opponents. He took the lead at the third last fence and won \\"very easily\\" by eighteen lengths from Marracudja. After the race Henderson said \\"I think he is a very good horse. Going round here on his first chase he was good and at Sandown he was also good. Today you could see he had really worked it out. What he did just now was really 10 out of 10\\". On 11 February 2017 Altior was matched against more experienced chasers in the Game Spirit Chase at Newbury in which his opponents were Dodging Bullets, Fox Norton (Summit Juvenile Hurdle, Cheltenham Chase) and Traffic Fluide. Starting at odds of 30/100 and ridden as on his three previous starts by Fehily he led for most of the way, drew clear of his rivals at the fourth-last fence and won by fourteen lengths from Fox Norton. Having won nine successive races, Altior returned to the Cheltenham Festival of 14 March 2017 and started the 1/4 favourite for the Arkle Challenge Trophy. The best fancied of his opponents were Royal Caviar, Charbel, Forest Bihan (Lightning Novices' Chase) and Cloudy Dream. After racing in second place, Altior was left in front when Charbel fell and the second last and stayed on well to win by six lengths from Cloudy Dream. On the final day of the season, at Sandown Park, Altior beat Champion Chase winner Special Tiara by 8 lengths in the Celebration Chase (in which he started 30/100 favourite). Timeform gave Altior a rating of 175p following this performance ranking him as second only to Douvan on 182. =2017/2018 season: steeplechases= Henderson identified the Tingle Creek Chase as Altior's first target for the 2017/18 season, with the Queen Mother Champion Chase as his long-term objective. In mid-November however this plan was scrapped when Altior developed a breathing problem which required surgery on his larynx and eliminated him from the Tingle Creek Chase. Henderson commented \\"hopefully he will be back in time for the Champion Chase at Cheltenham in March and perhaps the other championship races in the spring\\". The trainer was forced to defend his conduct in the matter, having stated just two days previously that the horse was \\"totally on target\\" for the Tingle Creek and then announcing the breathing problem in his blog on the website of online betting firm Unibet. Altior eventually made his seasonal reappearance on 10 February 2018 in the Game Spirit Chase where he was ridden by Nico de Boinville and faced by two rivals in the Tingle Creek Chase winner Politologue and Valdez. In a race run on very soft going Politologue made most of the running but Altior came to challenge over the last two fences, took the lead at the last and won comfortably by four lengths. Henderson said after the race \\"If you‚Äôd dreamt what would happen, that would just about have been it,\\" Henderson said. \\"He's just got class. His work is so easy. We‚Äôre very lucky to have a wonderful bunch of horses, but we haven‚Äôt got much that can go with him. He's done some good bits of work with other horses, but he's just better than them.\\" =2018/2019 season: steeplechases= Altior made a winning start to his 2018/2019 season when winning the Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown on 8 December 2018. He ended the calendar year by romping home to win the Desert Orchid Chase on 27 December 2018. His next start came in the Clarence House Chase at Ascot, he opposed two rivals, Fox Norton and Diego Du Charmil. He led the full way round and was unchallenged winning by 7 lengths, although jumping left. Altior returned to the Cheltenham Festival and was sent of at odds of 4/11 to retain his Champion Chase crown. Following Saint Calvados and then taking over 3 out, with a pack of rivals looming behind waiting to pounce, briefly headed by Sceau Royal, Nico de Boinville got to work on his mount and his trademark turbocharged finished kicked in and he surged clear and asserted towards the finish. He has now won at four consecutive Cheltenham Festivals and matched Big Buck's record of 18 wins in a row. =2019/2020 season: steeplechases = Altior's 19-race winning streak was ended at Ascot in November 2019 by Cyrname in the Grade 2 Christy 1965 Chase. He then missed out on running in both the Silviniaco Conti Chase and Clarence House Chase in January after recovering from an abscess but returned to form with a win in Newbury's Game Spirit Chase.

It stars Zoey Deutch, Kathryn Hahn, Tim Heidecker, Adam Scott, Joey Morgan, and Dylan Gelula. It had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 20, 2017. It was released theatrically on March 16, 2018, by The Orchard. Plot Erica (Zoey Deutch) gives a police officer a blowjob in his car while her two friends catch them in the act on video. They then extort him for money as Erica is not eighteen. It is revealed that she and her friends extort ephebophiles frequently as a form of vigilantism. Erica totals up her earnings, which she is saving up to bail her father out of prison. Her mom's new boyfriend Bob has a son, Luke, who gets out of rehab and comes to live with them. Erica and Luke soon develop an unlikely friendship. While at the bowling alley together, Luke has a panic attack when he sees his middle school teacher, Will Jordan (Adam Scott), whom he accused of sexual assault. Will was never charged due to inconsistencies in Luke's story. Later that night, Erica interrupts Luke's suicide attempt. Erica and her posse decide to make Will their next target, with Luke reluctantly participating. At the grocery store, Erica flirts with Will, who is aware she is a teenager in high school. Later, she approaches him at the bowling alley, and they make out in his car in the parking lot. Before it can go any further, she abruptly stops it. Her friends accuse her of sabotaging the plan because she likes him. The gang forms a new plan and they lace a beer with roofies. They accidentally pour in too much, so Erica says she won't let him drink the whole thing. Erica arrives at Will's house with the six pack, apologizes for the other night, and they go inside his house to hang out. Erica asks about the miniature Eiffel Tower replica on Will's coffee table, which was a gift from his ex-wife. This prompts Will to tell her about how he was accused of molesting Luke, which he vehemently denies. Although he was never charged, he tells her how the accusation ruined his life. Erica realizes he's almost done with the beer, so she slaps it out of his hand, and he feels the strong effect of the roofies. He grabs her arm, and Luke runs in and punches him, causing Will to fall backwards onto the coffee table, smashing it. The four of them pick Will up and prop him up on the couch while two of the girls strip down to their underwear and take pictures with him to use to blackmail him. Luke worries that his breathing is too slow, but they leave, shaken by the encounter. On the way out, Erica sees that the other girls vandalized his garage by spray-painting the word \\"pedophile\\" on it. The next morning, the cops show up at their house and accuse Erica and Luke of vandalism. When they mention that they haven't been able to get ahold of him yet, Erica and Luke go back to the house to make sure he's okay. When they arrive, Will is sitting limp on the couch exactly where they left him. They try to shake him awake and he falls over, revealing the Eiffel Tower model impaled in his back and a puddle of blood. Luke convinces Erica they have to run away to Mexico. While on the run, Erica throws up from guilt, and looks for reassurance from Luke that Will deserved what happened to him. Luke reveals that he was never molested by Will; he walked in on Will molesting his classmate and lied to protect her and other possible victims. Luke surprises Erica by driving her to her dad's prison and giving her bail money. However, she is heartbroken to find out that he was bailed out a few days ago and did not contact her. Erica decides she doesn't want to live her life on the run, and she wants to go home and turn themselves in. Luke agrees, but on their way back, a police car tries to pull them over. Erica tells Luke that they can't get caught before turning themselves in, so they try to lose the police on a dirt road. In the chaos, Luke confesses his love to her. They give up on the chase to stop to have sex and are found by police as they lie together on the ground. One month later, Erica visits Luke in prison, shortly before her house arrest begins. Despite their circumstances, they are happy and in love.

I have always been clumsy, tripping, dropping, falling with alarming regularity. This tape accepts the extent of the consequences.\\"Lisa Steele (Director) Birthday Suit ‚Äì with scars and defects (1974) Dist. V tape Birthday Suit ‚Äì with scars and defects was selected by Toronto International Film Festival as an essential part of Canada's cultural legacy.  Background  Lisa Steele was born in Kansas City, Missouri in 1947 and immigrated to Canada in 1968. An important pioneer of video art in Canada since the early 1970s,Russell 2002, p. 430 Steele has shown internationally at the Venice Biennale (1980), the Kunsthalle (Basel), the Museum of Modern Art (NYC), the National Gallery of Canada, the Institute of Contemporary Art (Boston), 49th Parallel Videoseries, the Vancouver Art Gallery and the Long Beach Museum. Her videos are in collections worldwide, including The National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Museum of Contemporary Art (Houston, Texas), Ingrid Oppenheim, Concordia University (Montreal), Newcastle Polytechnic (England), Paulo Cardazzo (Milan), the Canadian Embassy (Tokyo) and the Akademie der Kunst (Berlin). She is a founding director of Vtape in Toronto, a national information and distribution service for independent video and a founding publisher and editor of FUSE Magazine. Steele has collaborated exclusively with her partner Kim Tomczak since the early 1980s.  Context and description  Steele's earliest works are part of a key moment in video art history, not only setting the tone for her later work but in particular, pioneering a language for a medium becoming crucial in 1970s Canadian art. Early video art in Canada made by women was a direct critique of mass media with an \\"awareness\\" of \\"media's manipulation\\" of the viewer. Birthday Suit ‚Äì with scars and defects is a crucial early work that \\"has entered the canon of Western art history as one of the best examples of early feminist video art from Canada.\\" Like much early video art, the work is performance-based, with a static camera and one angle. The entire twelve minutes is unedited and > the soundtrack consists entirely of the sounds and voice of the take. > Notwithstanding the private and unspectacular setting, the strict form of > Birthday Suit. With Scars and Defects ‚Äì its seemingly rehearsed > choreography, the chronological ordering of memory, and the unvarying > repetition of gestures ‚Äì unsettles the viewer‚Äôs spontaneous impression of an > unedited sequence. Directly addressing the viewer as \\"you\\", moreover, > contrasts with the otherwise private setting. Such gaze alignment, which the > fixed camera position epitomizes, opens up the scene toward a literally > \\"exhibitionist\\" affirmation of self. In Birthday Suit with scars and defects Steele disrobes and examines the scars on her naked body, accumulated over her lifetime, on the day of her 27th birthday in order to channel the scars' \\"origin stories through the touch of her fingers, all in an effort to chart the marks endured in her twenty-seven years of life.\\" Like much of her work in the 1970s, Birthday Suit addresses the video medium as \\"a gendered tool of power [as a] means of surveillance and social control, or of confession and self-examination.\\"  Early video art in Canada  By the 1970s artists, seeking more control over their work but also the display and distribution, turned to mass media, new technology and communication technologies. Video, photography and audio became the media of choice for artists with a feminist practice. In particular, women artists utilized performance and technology to both engage the viewer but also as a form of direct documentation, often utilizing the artist's body. Birthday Suit ‚Äì with scars and defects is an important early example of feminist video art. Steele's approach to identity is both matter-of-fact but also fictionalized, employing irony and as an extension of conceptual art, practices of directness and banal bluntness. Early video art employs approaches first found in performance and body art in the 1960s. Addressing voyeurism (both from the mass media and modernist impulses) and using documentary tropes, in particular direct cinema, the first generation of video art's concerns with sexuality and sexual politics aligned it with feminist discourse of the era. Feminist art in the early 1970s operated in the \\"ideological\\" and \\"linguistic\\" space of the body. Steele's Birthday Suit engages with \\"nudity, pain and memory\\", reinventing the \\"adult female body\\" through memory. A form of \\"critical embodiment\\" Steele's video self-portrait \\"counters normative 'pedagogical spectacles' of women's bodies\\" by emphasizing the \\"unhealthy... body in ways that forcefully enact embodied agency.\\"  Reception and legacy  For the 2017 Canadian sesquicentennial, the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) selected a list of the 150 essential moving-image productions made in Canada, determined \\"through a national poll of over 200 members of the film, television, advertising and music industry along with journalists, critics, scholars, and filmmakers.\\" Birthday Suit ‚Äì with scars and defects was selected as an essential part of Canada's cultural legacy. Described as a canonical work of video art and body art, Birthday Suit ‚Äì with scars and defects is also an important influence on later artists. An aspect of online video sharing, on platforms such as YouTube, Vimeo and Dailymotion, is the aesthetic of the amateur where \\"non-professionals, art students, or amateurists comprise the vast majority of videos.\\" Often taking as their inspiration autobiographical video artworks of the 1970s, focusing on the physical body in front of the stationary camera, with minimal editing, the uploaders \\"physically or conceptually substitute the artist‚Äôs body and narrative for their own. In other words, uploaders employ the artist as a productive template for their recorded performances.\\" Steele is one of the most widely appropriated artists on video-sharing websites. Online videos employ Steele's performance of body narrative, often emphasizing the unhealthy, scarred or marked. Like Steele's direct engagement with an absent viewer, these online homages forge complex relationships with viewers, albeit anonymously and not as art.

He is best remembered for composing \\"I'm Coming Virginia\\" in 1926, which became a hit for Ethel Waters. He became a prominent figure in black musical theater, and produced scores for films such as Moon Over Harlem (1939) and Murder on Lenox Avenue (1941). Biography =Early years= Heywood born in Tunapuna, Trinidad and Tobago, in 1896. He showed an aptitude for playing the piano and with other stringed instruments at an early age. Heywood's father, a physician, was intent that his son follow in his footsteps, and sent young Heywood to college at Queens Royal College in Trinidad, and then to Fisk University in Nashville. Heywood studied at Fisk for two years before moving on to Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois for medical studies. During his time at Northwestern, Heywood's interest in music began to take precedence over his medical education. He moved to New York and began studying music at Kordkin Moser Conservatory. In 1923, he got his first professional music-related job. Heywood composed music for The North Ain't South, which was performed at Harlem's Lafayette Theatre. =Records, radio and Broadway= Heywood was working for RCA Victor by the early 1920s. On 29 August 1923 his \\"I Want My Sweet Daddy Now\\" was recorded by Rosa Henderson. On February 2, 1926 his \\"Charleston Ball\\" was recorded by the Charles Dornberger Orchestra. Heywood is best remembered for composing \\"I'm Coming Virginia\\", teaming with Will Marion Cook who added the lyrics. It is often wrongly attributed to vocalist Ethel Waters, who first recorded it on September 18, 1926 on the Columbia Records label with Cook‚Äôs Singing Orchestra, though she is credited with popularizing it. Trumpeter Bix Beiderbecke, pianist Fats Waller and the Paul Whiteman Orchestra featuring Bing Crosby all recorded it in 1927. The song has become a jazz standard, popular with Dixieland musicians and was recorded by many other artists including Benny Goodman in 1938. In 1927, Heywood continued his collaboration with Waters, recording tunes such as \\"Keep an Eye on Your Man\\", \\"I Want My Sweet Daddy Now\\" and \\"Clorinda\\" with her. Heywood and Waters made their Broadway debuts on July 11, 1927 with the Heywood-written revue, Africana. Heywood also performed in the musical he had written when a replacement was needed for cast member Louis Douglas. The role called for someone who spoke fluent French; Heywood had studied the language when at Fisk and Northwestern. The song \\"Clorinda\\" was part of the original score with \\"I Want My Sweet Daddy Now\\" added after the revue's first performance. The production ran for 72 performances at the Nederlander Theatre and put Waters on the road to stardom. The same year, Heywood's \\"Mango Lane\\" and \\"Susanne\\" was recorded by Dan Michaels and Hilda Perleno, singing as a duet, with Heywood accompanying them on piano. On 4 January 1928, the Paul Whiteman Orchestra recorded Heywood's \\"Smile\\". Heywood also made regular radio appearances with Hilda Perleno on WCGU during 1928. By 1929, he had a local radio program of his own. In 1931, Cab Calloway recorded his song \\"Black Rhythm,\\" a canny parody of stereotypes about black music.Richard Middleton, \\"Epilogue,\\" in Jazz Worlds/World Jazz , ed. by Philip V. Bohlman and Goffredo Plastino, p. 447. =Theater and film= In the early 1930s, Heywood capitalized on the surge in popularity of plays with all-black casts, often with religious themes. He became known for his work in black musical theater. Heywood's \\"The Black King\\", based on Marcus Garvey's life was a success on Broadway under L√©onide Massine, prompting him to approach Bud Pollard to direct a screen version in 1932. Heywood was later a film score composer for films such as Moon Over Harlem (1939) and Murder on Lenox Avenue (1941). For Murder on Lenox Avenue he wrote the songs \\"Trying to Forget\\", \\"I'll Get Even With You, and \\"What You Know About That\\". He also appeared in films; Oscar Micheaux's 1931 film, The Exile, featured Heywood's musical score and his appearance as \\"Don Heywood and his Band\\". He appeared in Micheaux's film Veiled Aristocrats and arranged the music for Ten Minutes to Live with a role as the master of ceremonies in the film. Heywood died in New York City in 1967 of unknown circumstances.

In Bath, Bird met the elderly Walter Sickert who became a major influence on him. During World War Two, Bird served in the Royal Navy and was deployed to the Far East and India. While on active service, Bird continued to paint and submitted a number of works to the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC. WAAC eventually purchased a small number of these pictures and they are now held in the Imperial War Museum and the British Government Art Collection. After the war, Bird studied at the Institute of Education in London, where his lecturers included Nikolaus Pevsner, before returning to Bath to teach art at the Bath Art Secondary School. In the early 1950s, Bird taught for a time as Head of Painting at the Bretton Hall Training College. In 1953 he joined the Community of the Resurrection at Mirfield in Yorkshire. Bird lived as a lay member of the Anglo-Catholic community there for eight years. When he left Mirfield, Bird joined the teaching staff at the Royal College of Art under Robin Darwin. There he taught drawing in the Film and Television School on a part-time basis before taking a full-time role as the vice-principal of the Central School of Art and Design. Bird worked at the Central from 1961 until 1983. From 1983 until the last year of his life, Bird presented an influential series of summer school lectures on The Art of Seeing.

However, under Article 61 of the Penal Code, exceptions may be granted in cases of necessity, which has typically been interpreted to permit an abortion necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman. In some cases, this exception has been extended to cases where the pregnancy poses dangers to the pregnant woman's health, and to cases of foetal impairment. A physician can only perform an abortion in such cases when two specialists approve, unless the woman's life is in imminent danger. Any person who induces an abortion may be imprisoned, and physicians who do so may be sentenced to prison. Convictions are uncommon, because the prosecution must prove that the woman was pregnant and the means by which the pregnancy was interrupted. In 1998, Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, the Grand Imam of al-Azhar, issued a fatwa calling for access to abortion for unmarried women who had been raped. In 2004 he approved a draft bill that would permit abortion in the case of rape; the bill was unsuccessful. Despite legal restrictions, abortions are common. In a 2000 study of 1025 women from six villages in Upper Egypt, 416 were found to have had at least one abortion; among this group, there were 265 abortions per 1000 live births. Abortions are carried out by indigenous methods, at clandestine clinics, or at great expense by private gynecologists. In addition, unsafe abortions are common: a 1998 study found that about 20% of obstetric hospital admissions were for post-abortion treatment. One study estimated that between 1995 and 2000, there were 2,079,216 abortions, and 2,542 maternal deaths due to unsafe abortions.

Depending on the German state, the exact name of the programme varies. History =Foundation= The first youth fire brigade in Germany was established in 1882 in Oevenum on the island of F√∂hr, making it probably the oldest in Europe. Due to many of the men working mostly at sea, the fire safety of the island was made the responsibility of the youth fire brigade. The first youth fire brigade in accordance with the modern model is the youth fire brigade based at Nieb√ºll, founded in 1953. During the Third Reich youth fire brigades were reorganized during the course of the Gleichschaltung as Hitler Youth fire brigades. The German Youth Fire Brigade (DJF) was founded in 1964 in Berlin. By the \\"Youth Law of the GDR\\" on the 4th of May 1964 working groups named \\"Young Fire Protection Helpers\\" were created in the GDR. Children in these groups were taught outside of school about the basics of fire safety, preventative fire protection, firefighting, and first aid. The working groups were generally headed by members of the volunteer fire brigade. After German reunification, the working groups were reorganized as \\"youth fire brigades\\". Education Youth Fire Brigades usually meet weekly for training. The training includes basic activities that are carried out by the fire service as well as training to improve dexterity, agility, and overall fitness, as well as improving the general knowledge of members. Youth firefighters are trained by experienced firefighters. Most of them are in leading ranks. Activities outside of the fire brigade are undertaken in many youth fire brigades. For example, camping, visits to cinemas, and sports such as soccer can be carried out. These help to promote a sense of camaraderie within the youth fire brigade. Uniform Bad Zwischenahn Jugendfeuerwehr The uniform of the youth fire brigade in Germany consists of appropriate footwear, youth fire brigade branded trousers, youth fire brigade branded shirts, a helmet, and cut resistant plastic gloves. Many youth fire brigades provide additional weather- proof youth fire brigade branded raincoats, and safety shoes/safety boots at their own expense. The jackets are blue with orange on the shoulders, and a reflective strip across the back. The trousers are blue with reflective stripes.

The areas were sites of mass murder during the Holocaust and other crimes against humanity targeting the civilian population. Background and planning During the early stages of the planning for the invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, the rear areas behind the front lines were envisioned to be subordinated to the respective armies, as they had during the invasion of Poland. By early April 1941, however, the military planners decided to limit the areas of army jurisdiction (), with the bulk of the territory to be controlled by the Army Group Rear Areas. The planners envisioned that the occupied territories would quickly pass onto civilian administration; thus, the directives called for the Army Group Rear Areas commanders to concentrate on the security of lines of communication and important military installations, such as storage depots and aerodromes. Army Group Rear Areas were also responsible for the transfer of prisoners of war to the rear. Organisation Army Group North, Army Group Centre and Army Group South Rear Area Commands were responsible for the rear area security in their respective areas of operation. Each had a headquarters subordinated to the corresponding army group, while also reporting to the Wehrmacht Quartermaster General Eduard Wagner, who had responsibility for rear security. Each Army Group Rear Area had a , for propaganda activities aimed at the civilian population. Army Group Rear Area commanders controlled nine Security Divisions, tasked with security of communications and supply lines, economic exploitation and combating irregular fighters (partisans) behind the front line. Security Divisions also oversaw units of the Geheime Feldpolizei (Secret Field Police) of the Wehrmacht. Rear Area commanders operated in parallel with the Higher SS and Police Leaders appointed by the head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, for each of the army group rear areas. In the words of historian Michael Parrish, these army commanders \\"presided over an empire of terror and brutality\\". Security warfare and atrocities The area commanders' duties included security of communications and supply lines, economic exploitation and combating guerillas (partisans) in Wehrmacht's rear areas. In addition to the Wehrmacht security forces, the SS and the SD formations operated in the same areas, under the command of the respective Higher SS and Police Leaders. These units included Einsatzgruppen detachments, three police regiments (North, Centre and South), the Waffen-SS units of the Kommandostab Reichsf√ºhrer-SS, and additional Ordnungspolizei (Order Police Battalions), which units perpetrated mass murder during The Holocaust in the areas of military jurisdiction. The security formations, often in coordination with or under the leadership of the Wehrmacht, conducted security operations against the civilian population, under the doctrine of Partisanenkrieg (later Bandenbek√§mpfung, or \\"bandit fighting\\"). \\"Anti-partisan operations\\" in \\"bandit-infested\\" areas amounted to destruction of villages, seizure of livestock, deporting of able-bodied population for slave labour to Germany and murder of those of non-working age. In its reports, the Wehrmacht units euphemistically described the operations as \\"elimination of partisan nests, partisan camps, partisan bunkers\\". Their records show that in the early phases of the occupation, in 1941‚Äì42, Wehrmacht security divisions lost one soldier killed for every 100 \\"partisans\\" that died, with the Jewish population making up the majority of the victims. In the Army Group Centre Rear Area, 80,000 \\"suspected partisans\\" were killed between June 1941 and May 1942, for 1,094 German casualties.

The frog is endemic to the Western Ghats, India, and is only known from its type locality, Pandipath, in the Agasthyamalai Hills, Thiruvananthapuram district, Kerala. Smaller than a human fingernail, it is among the smallest frog species in the world. Nyctibatrachus pulivijayani is part of a genus that evolved in India around 70‚Äì80 million years ago. The species of frog was discovered by scientists from the University of Delhi. Etymology The specific name pulivijayani honours Mr. Vijayan Kani, who supported Biju and his students during their field campaigns. He got the name Pulivijayan after braving a leopard attack (puli is Malayalam for \\"leopard\\"). The word puli can also allude to leopard-like spots on the dorsal surface of this species. Description Five adult males in the type series measure in snout‚Äìvent length; no females were collected. The snout is rounded. The tympanum is indistinct. The fingers and toes have discs but no webbing. The dorsum is light brown to silvery-brown and has prominent dark brown spots. The venter is light yellowish-brown with minute black speckles. The hands and feet are darker. The throat is light grey. Weakly developed dorso-lateral glandular folds are present and re separated by scattered granular projections. Habitat The type locality is an evergreen forest at above sea level. Specimens were found hiding under herbs and grasses on marshy ground, usually away from water. Males were observed calling both during the day and in the late evening.

It was originally entitled The Storyteller. The film's production was a personal project of Getty's, who largely self-financed at the estimated cost of $4-6 million. Production took fifteen years to complete. Following Getty's death in 2015, editing for the film was completed by producer Michael Luceri. It made its official premiere at the Fantasporto Film Festival on February 26, 2017; and was later acquired by Vision Films, who released the film via Video on Demand on April 4, 2017. It received mixed reviews from critics, who criticized the film's unevenness and dialogue while commending the film's strangeness, and Getty's devotion to the material.  Plot  Dennis is a man with a mental disability who has had nightmares all his life since he was a child, including one where he entered a carnival ride that seemed underwhelming. He is told that \\"the ride isn't over.\\" As an adult, Dennis has a dream where a living demon, called the Cadaver, fastens a zipper onto his back and enters his body. Also in his dream, he finds a hidden room in the cellar that holds a full-length mirror that Dennis believes the Cadaver came from. The very next day, his brother John presents him with an identical mirror as a gift. He begins speaking to his reflection, who seems to answer back to him. Dennis' brother John has difficulty of his own. His girlfriend, Lydia, demands that they get married, but is upset that he will not do anything about Dennis. He is visited by Mildy Torres, a woman from social services, who believes that Dennis needs to be taken away. This upsets John as he feels that Dennis is his responsibility. Dennis continues to have nightmares of the Cadaver and his reflection informs him that in order to get rid of it, they need to start killing animals. He begins working in the secret cellar, which perplexes John, especially when he sees that Dennis has videos on taxidermy. Dennis says the videos are not his but were accidentally switched with another customer. Once Dennis begins killing children, his reflection takes on a more competent demeanor and reveals that \\"he\\" was the one giving him the nightmares and that they still have more killing to do. Dennis meets with his crush Susan, an employee at his favorite ice cream place. He tries to ask her out, but the conversation gets awkward and Susan turns him down, hurting him. The Cadaver sends Dennis back to kill Susan. Before he can reach her, she runs out into the street and gets killed by a moving vehicle. When John and Lydia take Dennis to his favorite restaurant, he supposedly kills a man in the bathroom without hesitation, scaring himself. Dennis attempts to destroy the mirror, but his reflection pushes him in and takes on the \\"real\\" Dennis instead. After a night out, John and Lydia discover that they do not recognize anyone at places they visit regularly, implying that Dennis has killed more people. Mildy Torres arrives at the house with two officers and are all killed by Dennis. While sitting at a favorite cafe, John reveals to Lydia his secret: Dennis was a child prodigy whose works had been published in the newspapers. One day while arguing, John punched Dennis and he fell down the stairs. When he awoke, his mentality diminished greatly and John has felt guilty ever since. Lydia sympathizes with John and accepts the idea that if she and John marry, Dennis will always live with them. She leaves to get Dennis, so they can share the happy news over dinner. John's friend Pete is sitting nearby and reveals that the taxidermy tapes are Dennis'. John instructs Pete to call the police, and he hails a taxi. Lydia arrives at the house and is stabbed by Dennis, who proceeds to remove her insides. John arrives and enters the cellar, where he sits in a chair with a spotlight on it. Dennis appears with a now-stuffed Lydia and puts on a ventriloquist act and John realizes he is glued to the chair. The previous victims have all been stuffed and are used in an extravagant diorama revealing that John intentionally hit Dennis with a baseball bat while he was sleeping. Afterward, he used the fabrication of Dennis falling downstairs to cover his violent act. As more stuffed bodies are revealed, it becomes unclear if John or Dennis is seeing what is actually happening. Overwhelmed, John takes a gun and shoots himself. Dennis is slammed down by a Cadaver-Spider hybrid, only for it to be revealed that he is actually being restrained by police officers who drag him away. The final scene shows Dennis in a padded room. It is revealed that the reflection Dennis is still in control while the real Dennis is trapped deep in his subconscious.

According to a post-production producer who had worked on the film and a friend of Getty, Ryan Readenour: \\"When he was young he would have these really powerful, sick, twisted dreams, and [they were] so shocking to him that he didn't think they came from him.\\" Getty conceived the idea that it could be a storyteller who created these dreams, and The Storyteller was then used as the first title of the film. In a supplementary interview on the DVD release, Getty also stated he was inspired by the David Berkowitz Son of Sam killings, in which Berkowitz said he was ordered to kill by a demon taking the form of a talking dog. Getty postulated, what if there really was a demon giving the serial killer orders. Filming began in 2002, and the film was shot largely in Getty's own mansion. He also converted one of the rooms in his mansion into a post-production suite. He made his own unique camera rigs, built expensive sets, and with his FX team he created elaborate animatronic robots, including an octopus that can play a drum kit. The production however would stop and start over many years as it was beset with funding issues and conflicts with the cast, including a lawsuit from a studio assistant. The cast and crew also went through a number of changes, and according to Koehler, only he and Michael Berryman made it through to the changes. This is the final film to feature Matthew McGrory who appears in an uncredited cameo from footage shot before his death in 2005. The health conditions of both McGrory and Berryman (who had been ill for some years) had slowed down the production and scripted scenes had to be replaced. Getty continued to work on the film for many years after the filming, creating his own special effects and trying to perfect the film. He died in 2015 before the film was finished, with the coloring and editing not completed. Producer Michael Luceri, who had also edited the film, finished the film. Release The Evil Within made its official premiere at the Fantasporto Film Festival on February 26, 2017. It was later screened at the Dead by Dawn Horror Film Festival on April 20 that same year. Amsterdamned Film Festival on October 27. That same day the film was alternately screened at the Morbido Film Festival as a part of its \\"New Blood\\" section. =Home media= The film was later acquired by Vision Films and released on April 4, 2017 on VOD services in North America such as Amazon under a new title, The Evil Within. Critical reception The Evil Within received mixed reviews from critics, with many critics noting the unevenness of the film. However, on Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 100% approval rating based on five reviews. Most noted that in spite of its flaws, the movie succeeds in more ways than not. David Fontana of Film Inquiry thought that the film is \\"riddled with strange and unfocused plot-lines\\" and \\"filled with cringeworthy character acting\\", and that it \\"becomes so wrapped up in its own eccentricities that it is all but impossible to follow coherently\\". He nevertheless praised the film for its surreal visuals and special effects, and thought the \\"nuanced details\\" of the film \\"help to raise The Evil Within above its flaws\\", and that \\"it's hard to argue with that much [of Getty's] devotion to this singularly distinguished work of art\\". Charles Bramesco of The Guardian considered the film \\"very clearly the handiwork of a rank amateur under the influence of powerful narcotics\\", but that \\"Getty‚Äôs monomaniacal drive and technical knowhow resulted in some truly outr√© horror\\", and that his \\"wild experiments with the form command respect\\". Travis Johnson of Filmink criticized the film's dialogue, and felt that there were \\"no discernible reasons for scenes and interactions to exists at all\\", but still judged it \\"one of most singularly strange films to come along in a good while\\" and that it is a \\"remarkable cinematic artifact that is absolutely worth experiencing\\". Andrew Todd from Birth.Movies.Death. gave the film a mostly positive review, stating that the film was 'far more elaborately crafted than one would expect'. Todd further noted that the film's perceived \\"faults\\" were actually its strengths, comparing the film to Marcin Wrona's final film Demon as \\"it's hard to watch without reading the director's psychological state and subsequent death into it.\\" Andrew Marshall from Starburst Magazine rated the film a score of 7/10, while noting the film's \\"dubious\\" sub-plots and occasionally stilted dialogue, Marshall stated, \\"The Evil Within will not be for everyone, and as the years pass it's likely that the story of its prolonged production and tortured creator will become better known than the film itself, but one thing you can say for sure is that Andrew Getty has left his mark upon the world.\\" Matt Boiselle from Dread Central awarded the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, writing, \\"Solid cast-work, a disquieting overall aura, and Matthew McGrory in one of his final on-screen appearances ‚Äì it all adds up to a film that should be in your queue of midnight watches now.\\" See also * List of films shot over three or more years References External links  English-language films 2017 films 2017 horror films American independent films American supernatural horror films Demons in film 2017 direct-to-video films Direct-to-video horror films American psychological horror films ","title":"The Evil Within (2017 film)"},{"id":"53487083","text":"Ice core researchers from AWI drilling at the EastGRIP ice core site The East Greenland Ice-Core Project, known as EGRIP, is a scientific project that plans to retrieve an ice core from the Northeast Greenland ice stream.

In Sunni Islam, the concept of the logos has been given many different names by the denomination's metaphysicians, mystics, and philosophers, including  øaql (\\"Intellect\\"), al-insƒÅn al-kƒÅmil (\\"Universal Man\\"), kalimat AllƒÅh (\\"Word of God\\"), haqƒ´qa mu·∏•ammadiyya (\\"The Muhammadan Reality\\"), and n≈´r mu·∏•ammadƒ´ (\\"The Muhammadan Light\\"). Throughout Islamic history, there have existed several different metaphysical concepts that have been understood to correspond \\"in many respects\\" to the logos Christology of Christianity and to the use of the term logos in late Greek philosophy.Boer, Tj. de and Rahman, F., ‚Äú øA·∏≥l‚Äù, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Prophet Muhammad In the writings of many of the most prominent Sunni Islamic metaphysicians, philosophers, and mystics of the Islamic Golden Age, Muhammad, who is given the title of \\"Seal of the Prophets\\" in the Quran,Qur'an 33:40. was understood to be \\"both a manifestation of the Logos and the Logos itself, he was also very kind and had prayed for his people every night, and was always very worried about his peopleSeyyed Hossein Nasr, The Essential Seyyed Hossein Nasr, ed. William C. Chittick (Bloomington: World Wisdom, 2007), p. 63 This classical identification of Muhammad with the logos emerged from particular interpretations of specific Quranic verses, sayings of the prophet, and through the writings of the early mystics of Islam. Cosmological concepts At the same time, the logos concept was also intimately tied in the works of the same authors to other important Islamic cosmological concepts, such as the ideas of  øaql (\\"Intellect\\"), which \\"resembled the late Greek doctrine of the logos\\" and represented an Arabic equivalent to the Neoplatonic ŒΩŒø·ø¶œÇ (\\"Intellect\\"), law·∏• ma·∏•f≈´·∫ì (\\"Guarded Tablet,\\" in Quran 85:22),Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Ideals and Realities of Islam (London: George Allen & Unwin, 1966), p. 42 ·∏≥alam (\\"Divine Pen\\"), umm al-kitƒÅb (\\"Mother of the Book,\\" in Quran 3:7, 13:39, 43:4),Wensinck, A. J., ‚ÄúLaw·∏•‚Äù, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, First Edition (1913-1936), Edited by M. Th. Houtsma, T.W. Arnold, R. Basset, R.

The logos was often presented as \\"created\\" in Islamic doctrine, and thus was more akin to Philo's understanding of the phrase than Nicene Christianity. = øAql= One of the names given to a concept very much like the Christian Logos by the classical Muslim metaphysicians is  øaql, which is the \\"Arabic equivalent to the Greek (intellect).\\" In the writings of the Islamic Neoplatonist philosophers, such as al-Farabi () and Avicenna (d. 1037), the idea of the  øaql was presented in a manner that both resembled \\"the late Greek doctrine\\" and, likewise, \\"corresponded in many respects to the Logos Christology.\\" The concept of logos in Sufism is used to relate the \\"Uncreated\\" (God) to the \\"Created\\" (humanity). In Sufism, for the Deist, no contact between man and God can be possible without the logos. The logos is everywhere and always the same, but its personification is \\"unique\\" within each region. Jesus and Muhammad are seen as the personifications of the logos, and this is what enables them to speak in such absolute terms.Sufism: love & wisdom by Jean-Louis Michon, Roger Gaetani 2006 p. 242 Sufi essays by Seyyed Hossein Nasr 1973 p. 148] One of the boldest and most radical attempts to reformulate the Neoplatonic concepts into Sufism arose with the philosopher Ibn Arabi, who traveled widely in Spain and North Africa. His concepts were expressed in two major works The Ringstones of Wisdom (Fusus al-Hikam) and The Meccan Illuminations (Al-Fut≈´·∏•ƒÅt al-Makkiyya). To Ibn Arabi, every prophet corresponds to a reality which he called a logos (Kalimah), as an aspect of the unique divine being. In his view the divine being would have for ever remained hidden, had it not been for the prophets, with logos providing the link between man and divinity.Biographical encyclopaedia of Sufis by N. Hanif 2002 p. 39 Ibn Arabi seems to have adopted his version of the logos concept from Neoplatonic and Christian sources,Charles A. Frazee, \\"Ibn al-'Arabƒ´ and Spanish Mysticism of the Sixteenth Century\\", Numen 14 (3), Nov 1967, pp. 229‚Äì40. although (writing in Arabic rather than Greek) he used more than twenty different terms when discussing it. For Ibn Arabi, the logos or \\"Universal Man\\" was a mediating link between individual human beings and the divine essence. Other Sufi writers also show the influence of the Neoplatonic logos.Edward Henry Whinfield, Masnavi I Ma'navi: The spiritual couplets of Maul√°na Jal√°lu-'d-D√≠n Muhammad R√∫m√≠, Routledge, 2001 (originally published 1898), , p. xxv. In the 15th century Abd al-Karƒ´m al-Jƒ´lƒ´ introduced the Doctrine of Logos and the Perfect Man. For al-Jƒ´lƒ´, the \\"perfect man\\" (associated with the logos or the Prophet) has the power to assume different forms at different times and to appear in different guises.Biographical encyclopaedia of Sufis by N. Hanif 2002 p. 98 In Ottoman Sufism, ≈ûeyh G√¢lib (d. 1799) articulates S√ºhan (logos-Kalima) in his H√ºsn √º A≈ük (Beauty and Love) in parallel to Ibn Arabi's Kalima. In the romance, S√ºhan appears as an embodiment of Kalima as a reference to the Word of God, the Perfect Man, and the Reality of Muhammad.Bet√ºl Avcƒ±, \\"Character of S√ºhan in ≈ûeyh G√¢lib‚Äôs Romance, H√ºsn √º A≈ük (Beauty and Love)\\" Archivum Ottomanicum, 32 (2015).

United States  In 2014, the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research began to study the issue of overcriminalization, the idea that state and federal criminal codes are overly expansive and growing too quickly. At the federal level alone, Institute fellows identified over 300,000 laws and regulations whose violation can lead to prison time. The Institute asserts that this puts even well-meaning citizens in danger of prosecution for seemingly innocuous conduct. From 2014 to 2016, the Institute produced reports on the status of overcriminalization in five states (North Carolina, Michigan, South Carolina, Minnesota, and Oklahoma) and has continually added more state-specific research. National Review has described United States Supreme Court justice Neil Gorsuch as \\"a sharp critic\\" of overcriminalization.  United Kingdom  According to the Law Commission, the rate of introduction for new criminal offences has increased drastically since 1997, with 3,000 new offences having been added to the statute book between 1997 and 2010. The accusation of overcriminalisation has been challenged by Chalmers and Leverick.

In 2017, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) completed a process which began in 2012 to establish rules for commercial use of this band, while reserving parts of the band for the US Federal Government to limit interference with US Navy radar systems and aircraft communications. On January 27, 2020, the FCC authorized full use of the CBRS band for wireless service provider commercialization without the restrictions to prevent interference with military use of the spectrum. Under the new rules, wireless carriers using CBRS might be able to deploy 5G mobile networks without having to acquire spectrum licenses. History The creation of a new publicly available transmission band in the 3.5 GHz band was identified as a possibility by the US National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) for shared federal and non-federal use in its 2010 Fast Track Report. This band was identified as the Citizens Broadband Radio Service in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking released by the FCC in December 2012, which the FCC found would \\"promote two major advances that enable more efficient use of radio spectrum: small cells and spectrum sharing\\". The record was thereafter supplemented by a commission-level public notice and two workshops to discuss technical issues related to the proposed Service. In April 2014, the commission released a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that included detailed proposed rules to govern the new service. Operation The Citizens Broadband Radio Service is governed by a three-tiered spectrum authorization framework to accommodate a variety of commercial uses on a shared basis with incumbent federal and non- federal users of the band in the US. Access and operations will be managed by a dynamic spectrum access system, conceptually similar to the databases used to manage Television White Spaces devices. The three tiers are: Incumbent Access, Priority Access, and General Authorized Access. * Incumbent Access users include authorized federal and grandfathered fixed satellite service users currently operating in the 3.5 GHz Band. Under the rules promulgated by the FCC, these users, particularly including US Navy radar operators, will be protected from harmful interference from Priority Access and General Authorized Access users. Existing 3650‚Äì3700 MHz band operations \\"are grandfathered for up to 5 years\\", with the FCC's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and Office of Engineering and Technology charged with soliciting public comment on \\"the appropriate methodology for defining the grandfathered wireless protection zone contours\\". * The Priority Access tier consists of Priority Access Licenses (PALs) that will be assigned using competitive bidding within the 3550-3650 MHz portion of the band. Each PAL is defined as a non-renewable authorization to use a 10 megahertz channel in a single census tract for three-years. Up to seven total PALs may be assigned in any given census tract with up to four PALs going to any single applicant. Applicants may acquire up to two-consecutive PAL terms in any given license area during the first auction. * The General Authorized Access tier is licensed-by-rule to permit open, flexible access to the band for the widest possible group of potential users. General Authorized Access users are permitted to use any portion of the 3550-3700 MHz band not assigned to a higher tier user and may also operate opportunistically on unused Priority Access channels. Use of the CBRS band will not require spectrum licenses, and is expected to reduce the cost of data transmissions. This will enable carriers \\"to deploy 5G faster and easier, using the shared airwaves instead of trying to acquire spectrum licenses at auction or through deals\\". Since these frequencies have historically been used for government purposes, users of the CBRS band will be required to \\"take care not to interfere with others already using nearby airwave bands in some locations, including military radar stations and satellite receiver stations\\". As with Wi-Fi, CBRS equipment will be deployed to individual building owners, and those owners, or end users occupying the property, would pay a fee for spectrum allocation through a server.  CBRS Standards In 2015, the members of the Wireless Innovation Forum (WInnForum) formed the Spectrum Sharing Committee to \\"facilitate the interpretation and implementation of FCC rulemaking to a level that allows industry and government to collaborate on the implementation of a common, well functioning ecosystem...\\". Through this committee some 300 engineers from over 60 organizations developed the 10 baseline standards necessary for CBRS deployment. These standards covered requirements, security, protocols, professional installation, priority access licensing, and testing. Recognizing that the development of the standards alone was not sufficient to fully support a commercial ecosystem, the members of the WInnForum went on to establish a number of certification programs: * An accreditation program for public key infrastructure (PKI), root of trust (RoT) and certificate authorities (CA) supporting the CBRS Communications Security Standard and the PKI Certificate Policy * An accreditation program for Certified Professional Installer (CPI) trainers following the CPI standard * A program to authorize test labs to perform CBSD protocol testing following the WInnForum CBSD Test Standard This latter program was developed in coordination with the FCC: in order to be FCC certified to operate in the CBRS Band, an equipment manufacturer needs to show that their CBSD can communicate with a Spectrum Access System (SAS) and follow its directives as per 47 CFR Part 96. The CBRS ecosystem has developed standards in the WInnForum supporting SAS to CBSD communication (WINNF-TS-0016), and in addition, the WInnForum CBRS Test and Certification Task Group has developed a test specification (WINNF-TS-0122) and test harness supporting that standard. The FCC has determined that successful completion of the Wireless Innovation Forum defined tests will provide evidence of Part 96 compliance in this area. Final test code for CBSD protocol testing was released by the Wireless Innovation Forum on 24 May 2018, and since that time over 30 CBSDs have been certified and received their FCC ID, proving compliance with WInnForum specifications. The members of the WInnForum also worked to facilitate SAS certification testing, developing an open source SAS test harness to assess compliance with the WInnForum SAS test specification (WINNF-TS-0065) and the FCC rules. This test harness was turned over to the NTIA Institute for Telecommunications Sciences on May 26, 2018 and testing began on the SAS implementations provided by Amdocs, CommScope, Google, Federated Wireless and Sony.> This testing was completed in June of 2019, and marked the last major milestone necessary for the FCC to allow initial commercial deployment. CBRS Alliance In 2016, six companies interested in promoting CBRS technology and driving adoption formed the CBRS Alliance. As of mid-2017, the CBRS Alliance listed over 60 members, including Alphabet AT&T;, Charter Communications, Cisco Systems, Comcast, the CTIA, Ericsson, Federated Wireless, Intel, Nokia, Qualcomm, Ruckus Wireless, and SpiderCloud Wireless. Expected impact Bloomberg Technology has described CBRS as potentially being \\"[m]ore reliable than Wi-Fi\\" and \\"technology that risks making Wi-Fi outmoded\\", and quotes CBRS Alliance president Michael Peeters characterizing CBRS as possibly \\"a better option for factories, airports and ports\\". Network World has noted that it is \\"quite likely that the band will be used for 5G, and that might synch nicely with services offered in other countries that are actually targeting the band for 5G services\\". It is further proposed that such a 5G network \\"promises to let consumers download a high-definition movie in less than a second\\". Early Trials Beginning in 2017, a number of CBRS trial projects were initiated in various cities. In February 2017, Nokia, Alphabet and Qualcomm tested LTE technology in a CBRS- band broadcast of \\"live high-definition video of cars racing on a track in Las Vegas\\". In April, Kansas City, Missouri \\"approved a Google test of 3.5GHz shared wireless in more than eight locations in that area for up to 18 months\\". In May, Google received permission from the FCC to test wireless technology within the CBRS band at four NASCAR race events held during the summer of 2017, in Bristol, Tennessee, Brooklyn, Michigan, Darlington, South Carolina, and Richmond, Virginia. By August 2017, Verizon Communications had formed a consortium \\"to carry out the first use of CBRS band 48 spectrum in a 4G LTE Advanced (LTE-A) carrier aggregation demonstration\\". In November 2017, the CBRS Alliance entered into an agreement with the Wireless Internet Service Providers Association (WISPA) \\"to cooperate closely in the advancement of the CBRS spectrum band\\". Deployments In January 2019 the Global Mobile Suppliers Association reported that there were 11 companies investing in CBRS trials in the US, including AT&T; Mobility, Boingo Wireless, Charter Communications, Comcast Corporation, Google, Midcontinent Communications, T-Mobile US, US Cellular, Verizon Wireless and Windstream.GSA: LTE in Unlicensed and Shared Spectrum: Trials, Deployments and Devices (January 2019) Mobile Country Code 315 and Mobile Network Code 010 have been assigned for IMSIs in CBRS systems in the US. The LTE frequency band for CBRS in the US is referred to as band 48 in the 3GPP standards. In March 2019, Motorola Solutions launched Mototrbo Nitro, the first fully managed CBRS platform and product offerings. Mototrbo Nitro is a line of business-critical, CBRS communications and data products, which includes the first purpose-built OnGo portable radio. Deployment of Mototrbo Nitro infrastructure allows for services such as Nitro Cloud management, and is inter-operable with existing Mototrbo networks.

She attended graduate school in Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the University of Rochester receiving a master's degree in 2001 and a Ph.D. in 2003 in Brain and Cognitive Sciences. From 2003 to 2005, Thompson did post- doctoral research with a teaching fellowship at the University of New South Wales School of Psychology, in Sydney, Australia. = Career = After completing a summer as a Research Fellow at the University of Rochester, Department of Brain and Cognitive Science in 2005, Thompson was an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, NY from August 2005 to August 2007. In September 2007, Thompson became an Associate Professor of Psychology at Monroe Community College, Department of Psychology, where her academic research interests branched into the psychology of eating and positive psychology, and where she also developed courses in those two subjects. She started teaching the Psychology of Eating and Body Image in 2008 and Positive Psychology in 2009, was tenured in 2013 and continued at Monroe until June, 2016. In the spring of 2016, Thompson became an Adjunct Associate Professor in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at the University of Rochester. In the fall of 2014, Thompson founded Bright Line Eating Solutions, LLC, an 8-week online weight loss program based on psychology and neuroscience with four core principles, called Bright Lines, of eating no sugar, no flour, only at meals, and only bounded quantities.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UOMhDNWhzY Dr. Anthony Lim: Sugar: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly Thompson has been the CEO since 2014. In 2015, Thompson became the President of the Board of the Institute for Sustainable Weight Loss.  Bright Line Eating  Thompson launched Bright Line Eating in 2014. The program represents a synthesis of Thompson's personal experience in multiple Twelve-step programs for food addiction and her research as a brain and cognitive scientist. The name of the program derives from the legal concept of Bright-line rules, \\"a clearly defined rule or standard, composed of objective factors, which leaves little or no room for varying interpretation. The purpose of a bright-line rule is to produce predictable and consistent results in its application.\\" The program defines four such rules: * no sugar * no flour * meals (designated times for eating, with abstinence from eating at all other times) * quantities (the bounding of the quantity of food taken, using some measurement device (e.g., a digital scale to weigh food, or, more simply, a plate to contain the meal) and provides a set of tools, plus social support media, to guide the participant through both the weight-loss phase and during the \\"maintenance\\" phase that follows.

Education and early life Peter Folkes was born in Beaminster, Dorset, England in November 1923. He studied painting at the West of England College of Art, Bristol (1941‚Äì50) with his education being interrupted, though not curtailed, by The Second World War. Career Military service, in World War II, took Folkes to Africa, Sicily and Italy, as a draughtsman in the Signal Corps; he was mentioned in dispatches. In September 1950 Folkes became senior art-master at King Edward VI School, Southampton and later, after a year painting in America on a Goldsmiths Travelling Scholarship, awarded in 1963, he took up the post of lecturer in painting at Southampton College of Art in 1964. In 1989 he became Head of Fine Art at the Southampton Institute of Higher Education where he worked until retirement. (Southampton College of Art was merged, leading to the Southampton Institute of Higher Education which, in turn, became the present Southampton Solent University). Works Peter Folkes began painting local scenes of Southampton when he moved there in 1950. His early sketches and paintings are of the estuaries of the rivers Test and Itchen, boatyards, the docklands and Southampton Water. In the late 1950s Folkes experimented with the range of new materials becoming available. His fascination with old weathered gravestones, their carvings and inscriptions, too, developed at this time. Church spires appear in his later, much more Cubist, water-colours. Visits to Portland in the early 1960s resulted in a series of works that show a shift towards Modernism. Folkes, here, used a limited palette of blues and browns to describe the quarries and cliffs. In 1964, whilst in America, a series of paintings emerged, inspired by the regular geometry of skyscrapers. Graham Blakesley of Gable Contemporary Art has written: ‚ÄúSpanning sixty years of artistic output across the 20th century, the influences on Peter Folkes are eminently identifiable in his work. From the academic discipline of the Classical Renaissance to the French Impressionists, from the mid-century Abstract Expressionists through to Pop Art and social realism of the sixties, Peter has always retained an ability to absorb ongoing external influences only to process his own personal style which re-emerges with artistic interest.\\" For the RWA Academicians' Questionnaire of October 2000, Peter Folkes said: \\"During the last twenty-five years I have been strongly influenced by Cubist painters, in particular Lyonel Feininger, Charles Demuth and Raoul Dufy during his Cubist period. Also the water-colours of Eric Ravilious.\\" Collections The paintings of Peter Folkes are located in private collections and in the public collections of the UK Government Art Collection, Arts Council of Great Britain, Southampton City Art Gallery The Royal West of England Academy, the Universities of Hull, Keele, Portsmouth, Southampton (both Southampton and Solent), and King Edward VI School Southampton. Awards and prizes In 1952 he was elected an Associate of the Royal West of England Academy and was made an Academician (RWA) seven years later. In 1963 he was awarded a Goldsmiths Travelling Scholarship (USA). In 1969 he was elected a member of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours after which he became Vice-President in 1989. He was joint winner of the Winsor & Newton painting prize in 1981 and 1983; in 1998 he won the prize for the best painting in the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours Exhibition. Personal life Peter Folkes married Muriel Giddings in Bromley in September 1949. The following year, in 1950, Folkes and his wife moved to Southampton where they lived thereafter. Folkes has two sons: Andrew born in 1953, eand Richard born in 1950, plus six grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. He died in January 2019 at the age of 95.Peter Folkes RI, RWA, Hon.

It has a single hairy leaf and up to three relatively small, pink flowers which have a labellum with three distinct lobes. Description Caladenia reptans subsp. reptans is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which often grows in clumps. It has a single, hairy leaf, long and about wide with a purplish lower surface. Up to three pale to dark pink flowers long and wide are borne on a spike tall. The dorsal sepal is erect, long and wide and the lateral sepals are a similar size. The petals are long and wide and spread fan-like with the lateral sepals. The labellum is long, wide and has three distinct lobes. The lateral lobes usually have three red stripes and the middle lobe has between four and ten short teeth on the sides. There are two rows of thick calli along the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from July to early October. In areas of high rainfall it tends to only flower after fire but in drier areas it flowers in the absence of summer fires. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia reptans was first described in 1840 by John Lindley and the description was published in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. In 2001, Stephen Hopper and Andrew Phillip Brown described two subspecies, including subspecies reptans and the description was published in Nuytsia.

The first Hotel Phoenix opened at the site in 1848 but closed when it was confiscated by the Germans during World War II. The building was after the war converted into a new headquarters for the Danish Communist Party and the newspaper Land og Folk. The building was acquired by Arp-Hansen Hotel Group in 1990 and reopened as a hotel the following year.. It is mentioned in Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth, History =Gyldensten's mansion = Jean The Plessen Mansion The still undeveloped site at the corner of Bredgade and Dronningens Tv√¶rgade was in the middle of the 17th century owned by the pharmacist Esaias Fleischer. He was the owner of the L√∏ve Apotek (Copenhagen) Lopn Pharmacy on Amagertorv as well as property in several other locations in the city. In 1670, a few years after his death, it was sold to Hans Arenfeld, a nobleman and owner of Knivholt Manor at Frederikshavn. Rach and Eegberg in c. 1750 It was later acquired by commander of the Rotal Gorse Guards Samuel Christoph von Plessen. In circa 1780, he constructed a two-storey town mansion at the site. He left Copenhagen when the Toyal Horse Guards were moved to M√∏n in 1785 but kept the house in Bredgade. Its value was estimated at 16,000 Danish rigsdaler at the time of his death in 1704. Advertisement for Stadt Hamburg from c. 1838 The property was later acquired by count Jean Henri Huguetan Gyldensteen. He adapted the building in 1740. Gyldensten passed the house on to his illegitimate son Jean Henri Desmerci√®res in 1749. He constructed a new wing towards Dronningens Tv√¶rgade as an individual Tococo-style town mansion. At the turn of the 19th century it was owned by grocer Peder Erichsen. At this point it was the only privately owned building in Copenhagen whose facade featured a clock. =Hotel Stadt Hamburg= In 1837, the property was acquired by restaurateur and hotelier W. Murdoch from ¬ªStadet Lauenburg¬´ in Store Strandstr√¶de. He converted it into a hotel under the name ¬ªStadt Hamburg¬´. The shipbroking firm N. Schi√∏tt & Hochbrandt was based at Dronningens Tv√¶rgade 1-3 from 1820-46. It then moved to new premises at No. 10. =Hotel Phoenix opens= Hotel Phoenix in c. 1860 The Cavellier Hall in Hotel Phoenix, c. 1900 In 1847 it was acquired by an aktieselskab. The old building was demolished and Hotel Ph√∏nix opened in a new building in 1848. The hotel was frequently used for housing guests of the nobility as well as the royal family. The hotel was privately owned from 1883 to 1919. In 1891, Carl Neiiendam bought the hotel from the grocer Christopher Emil S√∏dring. He was appointed to Royal Court Hotelier after the hotel had been used for housing some of the guests for King Christian IX and Queen Louise's fold wedding in 1892. Carl Neiiendam sold the hotel in 1917. =Closure and reopening= The hotel in c. 1900 Hotel Phoenix was confiscated by the occupying German forces during World War II. The building was used as local headquarters of the German Navy. German soldiers on guard at the entrance to the confiscated hotel in 1945 In October 1945, a few months after the liberation, Hotel Phoenix was acquired by the Danish Communist Party. Ole Buhl and Harald Petersen were commissioned to adapt the building for its new use as party headquarters in 1946. The party's newspaper Land og Folk and several other associated activities were also based in the building. Arp- Hansen acquired the building in 1990.

Berns (born December 1, 1942) is a professor of surgery and cell biology at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and the University of California, San Diego. Berns is a founder of the first Laser Microbeam Program (LAMP), the Beckman Laser Institute, the UCI Center for Biomedical Engineering, and the UCI Photonics Incubator. His pioneering work has focused on the use of laser technology in medical and biological research. He has developed tools and techniques for the surgical use of lasers, down to the level of manipulating single cells and individual chromosomes. Berns has published extensively on use of lasers in both biomedical research and medical treatment of illnesses including skin disorders, vascular disease, eye problems, and cancer. Education Berns received his B.S. from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY in 1964, followed by his M.S. in 1966 and his Ph.D. in 1968. From 1968-1970, he held a postdoctoral position at the Pasadena Foundation for Medical Research, Pasadena, California. Career Berns was an assistant professor in the department of zoology of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor from 1970 to 1972. He them joined the University of California, Irvine (UCI) as an associate professor and department chair in the Department of Developmental and Cell Biology. He was named the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Professor in 1988. In addition to a number of appointments at the University of California, Irvine, he became an adjunct professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of California, San Diego in 2000. Berns founded the first Laser Microbeam Program (LAMP) at UCI in 1979. Sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as a National Biotechnology Resource, the LAMP center's sophisticated laser microsurgery instruments could be used by cell biologists from across the country. Berns co-founded the Beckman Laser Institute at UCI in 1982, with support from Arnold Beckman. The nonprofit institute for translational research opened on June 4, 1986. Berns was its first director, serving from 1982-2003. Berns was also a founding director of the UCI Center for Biomedical Engineering, from 1999 to 2000, and founded the UCI Photonics Incubator in 1999. Research In 2006, Berns received the Biomedical Optics Lifetime Achievement Award at SPIE's International Symposium on Biomedical Optics, ‚Äúfor his contributions to the development and growth of laser microbeam technology, a major step towards establishing new tools for understanding laser interactions with biological tissues, which have resulted in significant improvements in diagnosis and treatment of disease.‚Äù Sometimes referred to as the \\"father of laser microbeams,\\" Berns has written over 480 articles and 6 books. In 1969, Berns published a generative paper on use of lasers for subcellular surgery in Nature. Using an argon laser with a phase-contrast microscope, small lesions were placed at specifically chosen sites on the chromosomes of cells sensitized with chemical fluorophores. In subsequent research, Berns and others found that Nd:YAG lasers could be used to cut organelles such as mitochondria or stress fibers without prior sensitization. This landmark study concluded that focusable laser light could have wide application to the ablation of cell components in biological systems. When combined with a light microscope to display the structures in a living cell, lasers could be used to selectively target those structures with minimum damage to surrounding structures. Since then Berns has investigated the basic interactions of light beams at the levels of tissues, cells, and molecules. He has developed tools and techniques such as \\"laser scissors\\" and \\"laser tweezers\\" for manipulation of structures within a living cell, that can be used for the examination of cell biology and treatment of molecular pathology.

The product is typically made with unripe, green bananas that are dried and then milled into banana flour. Banana pasta is a gluten-free food. The product can be dried for later cooking or can be cooked immediately after preparation. Banana pasta is cooked like standard pasta, typically by boiling it. A study found that banana pasta has a higher water absorption rate compared to standard pasta, which generates higher yields after cooking. In 2012, University of Bras√≠lia researchers found that banana pasta can be a useful product for those with celiac disease, and that compared to whole wheat pasta, banana pasta is lower in calories and fat, higher in protein, and less expensive to produce. The product has also shown promise as a means to utilize green bananas, which have few industrial uses and a low commercial value. History =University of Bras√≠lia study= In 2012, food scientists at the University of Bras√≠lia conducted a study involving the creation of a banana pasta using green bananas, which were milled into flour; they published their results in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. In a taste test comprising 25 participants with celiac disease, a disease caused by an adverse reaction to gluten, and 50 without the disease, both groups favored the flavor of banana pasta compared to other gluten-free pastas, such as those prepared from brown rice, soybeans, quinoa, and potatoes. The group without celiac disease was also given pasta prepared from wheat flour, as a comparison. Favorable responses were higher among those with celiac disease, and was lower among those lacking the disease. Also, the non-celiac group \\"rated the green banana pasta the same as whole wheat pasta for flavor, aroma and appearance and liked the texture of the banana dish better\\". Compared to whole wheat pasta, the researchers found that banana pasta is higher in protein, lower in fat and calories, and less expensive to produce than whole wheat pasta. It was also suggested that banana pasta may contribute to controlling intestinal regularity and glycemic indexes because of the high levels of resistant starch in banana pasta. =Commercial production= In 2017, Tonya Ifill, an entrepreneur in Barbados, developed a banana pasta made with green bananas. Ifill stated that a significant aspect of developing the product was determining a proper amount of water to add to the banana flour, and that water temperature was an important factor as well. For example, if the water was too hot, the pasta crumbled. See also * List of banana dishes * List of pasta References Further reading * Rodrigues da Silva, Aline; (et al.)

The 1st Rockbridge Artillery were organized as part of the Stonewall Brigade in late April 1861 in Lexington, Virginia, from men of Rockbridge County. The battery fought at the First Battle of Manassas, supporting the brigade in its defense of Henry House Hill on 21 July. The battery provided artillery support for the brigade in the First Battle of Kernstown, the Battle of Port Republic, the Battle of Malvern Hill, the Second Battle of Manassas, and the Battle of Antietam. In October 1862 the 1st Rockbridge Artillery was detached from the brigade, and from that point in the war would be part of corps artillery battalions. The battery fought in the Battle of Fredericksburg, the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Battle of Gettysburg, the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, and the Siege of Petersburg. After the Confederate abandonment of Petersburg, the 1st Rockbridge Artillery joined in the retreat and surrendered at Appomattox Court House on 9 April 1865.  History  = Formation = The seventy men of the 1st Rockbridge Artillery were organized in April 1861 by VMI professor John McCausland. William N. Pendleton took command of the battery in late April after McCausland was transferred to command another unit. The battery was initially equipped with two 6-pounders from VMI and two guns from Richmond. Pendleton named the first four guns \\"Matthew\\", \\"Mark\\", \\"Luke\\", and \\"John\\", after the Apostles. On 11 May, the battery departed for Harpers Ferry, where it joined Thomas J. Jackson's Virginia brigade, which was later called the Stonewall Brigade. = First Manassas = On 18 July, the battery moved east with the Stonewall Brigade to link up with Confederate general P. G. T. Beauregard's troops at Manassas Junction. On 21 July, during the First Battle of Manassas, Pendleton's Battery was among the Confederate batteries defending the key position of the battle, Henry House Hill. The battery was visited by Confederate president Jefferson Davis, who had gone to Manassas to watch the battle, during the Union retreat. In the aftermath of the battle, the battery received captured Union cannon.

With a few other women, she formed the Woman Suffrage Association of Missouri and an Industrial Home for Girls in St. Louis. She organized a society known as the Freedmen's Aid Society, and served as president of the American Woman Suffrage Association. Early life and education Rebecca Naylor was born in Woodsfield, Ohio, November 10, 1826, the daughter of Robert F. Naylor (born in Pennsylvania, but lived mostly in Virginia) and Mary Bettis Archbold (of Virginia). Till the age of 14, she studied at Monroe Institute and the Marietta Seminary. The family then removed to Cincinnati, Ohio, and later to Quincy, Illinois. In Quincy, in 1844, while still a teenager, she married William Tweedy Hazard, of Newport, Rhode Island. Career The husband was not a college man. His occupation during most of his life was that of a manufacturer (flour mills). Five children were born to the couple. In 1850, the family removed to St. Louis, Missouri. For many years, domestic affairs claimed the attention of Hazard. =Philanthropist= In 1854, she united with other women in establishing an Industrial Home for Girls in St. Louis.

At the breaking out of the American Civil War, Hazard, who was an ardent Unionist, engaged in hospital work, including the care of sick and wounded soldiers. She helped to organize the Union Aid Society and served as a member of the executive committee in the great Western Sanitary Fair. Finding that large numbers of African American women and children were by the exigencies of war helplessly stranded in the city, Hazard sought means for their relief. They were in a deplorable condition, and, as the supplies contributed to the soldiers could not be used for them, she organized a society known as the Freedmen's Aid Society, for their special benefit. At the close of the war, that society was merged in an orphan asylum. Closely following that work came the establishment of a home for women, which was maintained under great difficulties for some years, before being abandoned. With Mary Foote Henderson, Hazard co-founded the School of Design for women in the field of decorative art. It later became part of the Woman's Exchange. =Suffragist and writer= Deeply impressed with the disabilities under which women labor in being deprived of political rights, Hazard, Virginia Minor, Anna Clapp, Lucretia Hall, and Penelope Allen, met in May 1867, and formed the Woman Suffrage Association of Missouri, the first society bearing the name, and having for its sole object the ballot for woman. Devoted to this cause, Hazard gave it her attention for many years, filling the various offices of the association, and also serving one term as president of the American Woman Suffrage Association. She authored the popular suffragist song, \\"Give the Ballot to the Mothers\\" which was sung by a choir at the first convention of the Kentucky Equal Rights Association in November 1889. In 1870, the city of St. Louis, falling under evil counsels, framed into law the Social Evil Ordinance. Realizing the danger to good morals, Hazard at once engaged in the conflict for the overthrow of law. Three years later, she met with other women and organized an appeal to the legislature through a petition campaign to rescind it. The law was repealed by the Missouri Legislature in 1874. The call for the formation of the association for the advancement of women, known as the Woman's Congress, was signed by Hazard, and she continued to be a member of that body, contributing at various times to its sessions the following papers: \\"Home Studies for Women,\\" \\"Business Opportunities for Women,\\" and \\"Crime and its Punishment.\\" Personal life In 1844 Rebecca N. Hazard married William T. Hazard (1812-1879), of Newport, Rhode Island. Five children were born to this union, among whom: Charles F. Hazard (1847-1877), Nathaniel Hazard (1848-1928), William T. Hazard (1851-1914). In 1850, the family moved to St. Louis, Missouri. After the death of her husband, in 1879, Hazard mostly retired from public work, but at her home in Kirkwood, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis, a class of women met each week for study and mutual improvement. As a result of these studies, Hazard published two papers on the \\"Divina Commedia.\\" She also wrote a volume on the war period in St. Louis. Her contributions to local and other papers were numerous. Hazard was a member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and of the American Akademe, a philosophical society having headquarters in Jacksonville, Illinois. She died in Kirkwood in 1912. She died on March 1, 1912, and is buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery, St. Louis, Missouri.

The level of corruption used to be considerably lower in Eritrea than in many other African countries. Indeed, it was traditionally viewed as having a ‚Äústrong ‚Äòanti-corruption‚Äô culture‚Äù and considered relatively ‚Äúegalitarian and corruption-free.‚Äù In 2006, a report by Bertelsmann Stiftung stated that corruption, as of that date, was not a serious problem within Eritrea. While noting that there had been ‚Äúcases of corruption since independence,‚Äù they existed on a negligible level, although politically-motivated corruption allegations have been made. But, in fact, corruption is said to have been growing steadily worse ever since 1998, when, not long after the end of its decades-long war of independence, a border conflict with Ethiopia led to another war. Another source stated in 2015 that over the previous decade, corruption had become ingrained in Eritrean everyday life, with bribes required for most government services. Other alleged types of corruption include the payments of ransoms for hostages ‚Äúunder the eyes of the government.‚Äù On Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index for 2014, Eritrea ranked at 166th out of 175 countries. On a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being highly corrupt and 100 very clean, its score in recent years has declined from 25 in 2012 to 20 in 2013 to 18 in 2014. Background Eritrea's location along the Red Sea Eritrea was a part of Ethiopia until 1991, when Eritreans won a civil war that had lasted for thirty years and were granted independence. After a UN-supervised referendum, in which Eritreans voted overwhelmingly for independence, Eritrea declared its independence in 1993. At that time, Eritrea had a weak private sector with few skilled workers, a situation that led the government to take steps to build a strong private sector. During the 1990s, the private sector began to flourish and the economy grew significantly, causing many observers in the West to view Eritrea ‚Äúas a beacon of Africa.‚Äù The decades of war, however, had planted the seeds of many social and economic problems, corruption among them. A 1998 border conflict with Ethiopia led to another war, which ended in 2000. Despite the official end of the war, warfare has continued on a lower scale. Meanwhile the regime has been accused of clamping down on free speech, shutting down private newspapers, shrinking the private sector, and imposing indefinite military service. All of these moves against individual liberty, human rights, and the free market have been factors in increased corruption. As of 2006, Eritrea had not yet held free elections; the Constitution adopted at the time of independence had not yet been implemented; the president was ruling by decree; the National Assembly had last met in 2002; opposition parties were prohibited, as were civic organizations, the right to assemble, and freedom of the press; the judiciary was inactive; the ruling party, government, and military formed ‚Äúone single conglomerate of power‚Äù with ‚Äúa low level of transparency.‚Äù Since 2001, civil liberties had been ‚Äúgradually restricted,‚Äù with ‚Äúnumerous arbitrary arrests‚Äù and human-rights violations on an ‚Äúalarming‚Äù scale. From 126th place on Transparency International's 2009 Corruption Perceptions Index, Eritrea dropped to 134th in 2012 and 166th in 2014. The increase in state ownership in Eritrea has been critiqued as a step back for economic freedom and for doing business generally, partly because it has caused rising corruption. The 2012 Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom named Eritrea the second-worst country in sub-Saharan Africa for economic liberty. The World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Project Index for 2011 ranked Eritrea at 180th, with only three countries, Guinea Bissau, Central African Republic, and Chad, scoring worse. It has been suggested that since the government maintains control over foreign exchange, friends of government personnel are allowed to bring goods into the country and sell them at great profit, thus increasing opportunities for corruption. Nonetheless, economic growth has been very strong since 2011, largely because of country's mining boom, which has placed Eritea among the fastest growing nations on earth; but corruption has kept this new wealth from reaching as many people as it might have. At the same time, the country has also been ravaged by drought. Factors Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki meets with former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld Among the supposed factors breeding corruption in Eritrea is the intense concentration of power. The Eritrean Constitution calls for a separation of powers among the judiciary, executive, and legislative branches, but this has never been implemented. Isaias Afwerki, who has been president since 1993, has usurped the Congress's constitutional powers and is generally viewed as being all-powerful. The 19-member Executive Council consists entirely of presidential cronies. Eritrea's business community is composed mainly of personal associates of the regime's economic officials, fronts for top-level officials of the ruling party, and people who ‚Äúenjoy the patronage of senior officers of the security and military establishments.‚Äù The government ‚Äúcontrols all foreign exchanges‚Äù and is ‚Äúvirtually the only legal source of imports,‚Äù a situation that makes it possible for military and government officials to profit by collaborating with illegal smugglers. Similarly, the country's strict laws about importation and the inconsistency in the granting of exit visas enable customs and immigration officials to profit from bribery and money laundering. A 2014 report has described institutional corruption has \\"erode[d] the foundations\\" of economic development. The state's control on the economy allows for little private investment, while extremely low government salaries encourage corruption. An additional factor in the spread and persistence of corruption is the lack of an independent press to report on it. Eritrea has been described as ‚ÄúAfrica's biggest prison for the media.‚Äù The only news media are government-owned, and experts compare them to the Soviet media. Judiciary The 1997 Eritrean Constitution calls for a judiciary that is independent from parliament. None of this has been implemented, however. Instead there is a judicial system consisting of two separate court systems: Regular Courts that adjudicate disputes based on law and Special Courts that adjudicate disputes that are not based on law.Kjetil Tronvoll; Daniel Rezene Mekonnen (2014). The African Garrison State: Human Rights & Political Development in Eritrea. Boydell & Brewer Ltd. pp. 46‚Äì. . The latter courts are supposed to address corruption, but are themselves considered by Amnesty International and other experts to be ‚Äúone of the most corrupt and inhumane court systems‚Äù globally.Vernon Valentine Palmer; Mohamed Y. Mattar (22 July 2016). Mixed Legal Systems, East and West. Routledge. pp. 158‚Äì. . Military A 2013 report by Transparency International UK called Eritrea the ‚Äúmost militarised country in Africa,‚Äù with about 20% of its population in uniform. For this reason, many have called Eritrea the 'North Korea' of Africa. The army is not only large but also one of the nine most corrupt armed forces in the world, along with Algeria, Angola, Cameroon, the DRC, Egypt, Libya, Syria, and Yemen. According to TI, there is a possible scheme in place of public funds earmarked for \\"secret\\" military purposes in the name of national security which are in truth appropriated illicitly. There are said to be several military-owned businesses with ‚Äúunauthorised private enterprise by military personnel.‚Äù Nationalization In 1996, Eritrea's government declared that all land would henceforth be considered the property of the state and would be re-distributed in accordance with need. It then confiscated a good deal of private land and turned it over to former soldiers, foreign investors, and resettlement programs. The 1990s also saw the privatization of some companies, and since 2000 the government has increasingly intervened in the economy and commerce and propagandized against private trade and business. These activities have involved a considerable amount of favoritism, kickbacks, and other forms of corruption. Mining Industry In July 2013, Martin Plaut reported that since 2011, the government had earned over $900 million from the Bisha gold mine, but it was not known what had happened to the money. Even as the state was reportedly amassing huge mining profits, Plaut charged, poverty and hardship were worsening. ‚ÄúThere is some evidence,‚Äù he stated, ‚Äúthat show the [government] is gambling and squandering state resources without any accountability.‚Äù Persecution of Christians Eritrea, as of 2011, was one of 8 nations considered to be Countries of Particular Concern (CPC) by the US State Department owing to the abuse and persecution of Christians other than those belonging to the three recognized denominations: the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Eritrean Catholic Church, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Eritrea. ‚ÄúUp to 3,000 Christians from unregistered church groups were held in detention‚Äù in 2011, according to Amnesty International. Between 2002 and 2011, many churches were closed, and tens of thousands of Christians fled the country; state-owned media have told the public that suppressed Christian groups were being paid by the CIA to destabilize the government, and have actively encouraged citizens to turn in persons whom they suspect of holding prayer meetings in their homes. This mass religious persecution has provided an opportunity for extensive corruption of a specific kind on the part of ruling-party politicians and military officials, who have arrested suspected Christians under the country's official anti-Christian policy and held them in prisons, unofficial detention centers, and military barracks in exchange for ransom. Anti-corruption efforts There is reportedly no real organized effort in Eritrea to combat corruption. The regime has been described as using a ‚Äúso-called war on corruption‚Äù to crack down on political dissenters and opponents. In May 2015, the president urged a group of party and government officials to discuss American and European pressure on Eritrea to reform its government and release detainees, yet when some of those officials proposed that the government reform in certain areas to appease Western nations that send aid to Eritrea, the president underscored the need to stand up to pressure from the ‚Äúhegemonic West.‚Äù Business leaders in Eritrea were reportedly ‚Äúshivering with fear‚Äù over what the president's comments might signify; it was said to be unclear if the rumors signified a wave of jailing or not. Shortly after the aforementioned meeting, the president addressed the country on the 24th anniversary of Eritrean independence, denouncing ‚Äúdeluded and corrupt‚Äù state officials who, he charged, amassed wealth illegitimately. ‚ÄúSuch deplorable practices of corruption and theft,‚Äù said the president, ‚Äúmust be combated vigorously.‚Äù  See Also * International Anti-Corruption Academy * Group of States Against Corruption * International Anti-Corruption Day * ISO 37001 Anti-bribery management systems * United Nations Convention against Corruption * OECD Anti-Bribery Convention * Transparency International References External links Eritrea Eritrean society Crime in Eritrea Politics of Eritrea Eritrea Eritrean law Economy of Eritrea Government of Eritrea ","title":"Corruption in Eritrea"},{"id":"53488076","text":"The Tripartite Indenture of 1856, was an agreement between the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the City of Boston, and the Boston Water Power Company signed December 11, 1856.

Founded as a fur trading post at the head of navigation of the Missouri River, it was prior the advent of the railroad one of the nation's largest inland ports, playing a pivotal role in the development of the American and Canadian West. The Front Street and waterfront area of the city preserves elements of this history. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961, although its boundaries were not formally determined until 2012. Description and history Fort Benton was founded in 1846-48 by Alexander Culbertson, a fur trader working for the Chouteau brothers firm. It was named for Senator Thomas Hart Benton, and was originally little more than a palisaded fort, with the facilities of the trading firm within. At first goods were moved up and down the river by keelboats and other human or animal-powered watercraft. In 1859 the Chouteaus acquired a steamboat, and began service from St. Louis, Missouri. At more than 3000 river miles from the sea, it has been described as \\"the world's innermost port\\". From 1860 to 1890 it was one of the principal points of embarkation for supplies and good that drove the development of the American West. Its proximity to Canada meant that goods and supplies also traveled north, helping fuel the growth of cities such as Edmonton, Alberta. Goods were loaded and unloaded on the levee, and merchants managing the trade had their business on Front Street, with homes nearby. The river trade declined in the late 19th century after railroads became a more reliable means of transportation in the region. The historic district extends along Front Street, from the 1200 to 1900 blocks, and includes the levee along the river bank, and the 1888 Fort Benton Bridge, built in an attempt by the local merchants to maintain the city's influence as the steamboat trade declined. The district includes the site of Fort Benton, which has a surviving element an 1856 blockhouse, the levee, built in 1860, the 1882 Grand Union Hotel, and the Fort Benton Engine House, a fire station that also served as city hall for many years. The 1867 I.G. Baker House is the oldest surviving residence in the district.

Similar to other strains of Polynesian dogs, it was introduced to the Society Islands and Tahiti by the ancestors of the Tahitian (MƒÅ‚Äôohi) people during their migrations to Polynesia. They were an essential part of traditional Tahitian society; their meat was included in Tahitian cuisine and other parts of the dog were used to make tools and ornamental clothing. Dogs were fed a vegetarian diet and served during feasts as a delicacy. European explorers were the first outsiders to observe and record their existence, and they were served to early explorers including Captain James Cook. The Tahitian Dog disappeared as a distinct breed after the introduction of foreign European dogs. History The Tahitian Dog, known as the  ª≈™rƒ´ MƒÅ‚Äôohi in the Tahitian language, was introduced to Tahiti and the Society Islands (in modern French Polynesia) by the ancestors of the Tahitian (MƒÅ‚Äôohi) people during their migrations to Polynesia. They were closely related to the Hawaiian Poi Dog and the New Zealand kurƒ´; the latter is believed to be a descendant of the breed. Similar breeds of Polynesian dogs were brought alongside pigs and chickens when the people settled the islands of Polynesia. Genetic studies indicate that the New Zealand kuri/dog is derived from Indonesian dogs, and therefore by inference it is likely that Society island dogs are of the same origin. The Marquesan Dog became extinct in the neighboring Marquesas Islands before 1595. Even though dogs were virtually absent from Western Polynesia, they were recognized when European explorers later brought them as items of trade, indicating a universal cultural recognition of the dog in the many islands. Dogs were tied with strings around the belly and kept in the house where they were raised as a food source alongside domesticated pigs. Seen as a delicacy, they were served during feasts and to the high chiefs. Dogs were less abundant than pigs in the islands, possibly because they were killed while they were young. European visitors noticed that native women, especially those who lost their own children, would often breastfeed puppies and small pigs. The taumi, a traditional breast ornament, fringed with dog hair from the Tuamotus, James Cook Collection: Australian Museum They were an essential part of traditional Tahitian society. Dog teeth were fashioned into fishhooks and dog bones were made into weapons and implements. They also used dog hair, especially the long tail hairs of the Tuamotuan varieties of dogs, to decorate the fringes of the taumi ‚Äì a traditional breast ornament often called a gorget ‚Äì which were worn by priests and high chiefs. The Tuamotuan breed were described as similar to their Tahitian counterparts distinguishable by their longer hair. Historian Margaret Titcomb noted that Tuamotuan varieties may not have been a separate breed that developed in isolation, arguing that the people of the Tuamotus could have eaten their short hair varieties and kept their longer haired dogs for exports to the Society Islands. The Tahitian Dog became extinct in the Society Islands some time after the arrival of European settlers due to the introduction and interbreeding with European dog breeds. By 1834, British traveler Frederick Debell Bennett noted: \\"Amongst the Society Islands, the aboriginal dog, which was formerly eaten as a delicacy by the natives, is now extinct, or merged into mongrel breeds by propagation with many exotic varieties.\\" Most other breeds of Polynesian dogs also became extinct due to interbreeding with foreign dogs by the beginning of the 20th century. This breed and other Polynesian dogs were sometimes considered a distinct species by 18th century naturalists and scientists, and received scientific names such as Canis domesticus, indicus taitiensis (1778) by Georg Forster, Canis familiaris villaticus, meridionalis (1817) by F. L. Walther, Canis otahitensis (1836) or Canis familiaris orthotus otahitensis (1836) by Heinrich Gottlieb Ludwig Reichenbach, Canis pacificus (1845) by Charles Hamilton Smith, and Canis familiaris otahitensis (1859) by Christoph Gottfried Andreas Giebel. Luomala noted that the \\"source material of taxonomists has been derived, often at second- and third-hand, from impressionistic descriptions by members of the expeditions of Captain Cook and other eighteenth-century explorers, none of whom give a single measurement or preserved a specimen for scientific study\\". Characteristics A dog sitting below a boy in an outrigger canoe from Sydney Parkinson's A view of the island of Otaheite with several vessels of that island, c. 1773. The Tahitian dogs were described as having a small or medium build, resembling terriers or crooked-legged dachshund in size. Their coats were usually brown, white or rust-yellow with smooth hairs. They had broad heads, small eyes, long backs, sharp-pointed muzzles and erect ears. They were described as lazy, shy, and not ferocious, but as having notoriously bad dispositions. They seldom barked but sometimes howled. Often they are lumped together with the Hawaiian Poi Dog by 19th-century taxonomists because of their similar appearance and diet, in contrast to the kurƒ´, which was much larger in size due to their higher protein diet. Their diet included breadfruit, coconut, yam and poi made from taro and sometimes fish. This soft vegetarian diet caused the dogs to develop round skulls and a small stature. German naturalist Georg Forster wrote generally about the Polynesian dogs, but more specifically in response to the ones he saw in the Society Islands during a visit to Huahine in September 1773: > The dogs of all these islands were short, and their sizes vary from that of > a lap-dog to the largest spaniel. Their head is broad, the snout pointed, > the eyes very small, the ears upright, and their hair rather long, lank, > hard, and of different colours, but most commonly white and brown. They > seldom if ever barked, but howled sometimes, and were shy of strangers to a > degree of aversion.  European encounters  Tahitian Dogs were offered and served by high ranking chiefs to the early European explorers who visited the islands. In 1767, British explorer Samuel Wallis observed the breed for the first time in Tahiti. They were bounded \\"with their fore-legs tied over their heads\\" and attempted to run away in an erect position; Wallis initially took them for \\"some strange animal\\". When trading with natives, Wallis' men accepted the offerings of hogs and cloth but untied the dogs and turned them loose, an act that confused the Tahitians. On his first voyage, Captain James Cook and his crew developed a taste for the dog during a three-month stay in the Society Islands in 1769. Cook wrote an account of the first time his men tried dog meat and the traditional process of preparing the meat: In his journal, Cook noted, \\"For tame Animals they have Hogs, Fowls, and Dogs, the latter of which we learned to Eat from them, and few were there of us but what allow'd that a South Sea dog was next to an English lamb\\". Artist Sydney Parkinson reported that Captain Cook, Banks and Solander when in Tahiti said roasted dog was 'the sweetest meat they ever tasted' although Parkinson stated he abhorred the 'disagreeable smell' which put them off, such that they could not be prevailed upon to eat it. Naturalist Joseph Banks made a similar report. Dog in a canoe depicted in John Webber's A view of Huaheine, from the Third voyage of James Cook During Cook's second voyage, Forster brought two Tahitian Dogs aboard the ship to take home to England. They were tested with arrow poison at Malakula by having their legs opened with a lancet and inserted with the substance; both dogs recovered, though one later died from eating poisonous fish. However, the fate of the other dog and their remains is unknown. Depictions in European art Western artists often infused Euro-American characteristics in their depictions of the dogs of Polynesia and possibly many actually depicted the pet dogs kept on European ships rather than native breeds. This resulted in few accurate depictions of the dogs surviving. A few works likely depicting the aboriginal dog breed done by Parkinson, Webber, Alexander Buchan and John Frederick Miller were compiled by American anthropologist Katharine Luomala including the two images above. Otaheite Dog, aquatint engraving by Charles Catton the younger, 1788 In 1788, Charles Catton the younger, who did not accompany any of voyages, depicted an aquatint engraving of an \\"Otaheite Dog\\" in his book Animals Drawn from Nature and Engraved in Aqua-tinta. Based on its appearance and description, it may actually been a kurƒ´ instead. Artist Paul Gauguin depicted dogs in Tahiti and the Marquesasalthough it is unclear whether they were the prototypical Polynesian Dogin several works, including I raro te oviri (I) (Under the Pandanus I) (1891) and Arearea (Joyfulness) 1892. The prominence in his paintings of these collarless free range dogs has been the subject of much speculation as to their symbolic or metaphorical meaning.  Archaeology  Archaeologic records indicate that dogs were present in the Society Islands from the period of initial settlement up to the point of European contact. Modern digs in Tahiti and the other Society Islands have uncovered few surviving remains of the Tahitian Dog. In 1960, a few canine teeth were uncovered at Ana Paia shelter, on Mo'orea. In 1962, a complete skull, limbs, and vertebrae were discovered at a marae site on Mo'orea along with a jawbone at another site on the same island. In 1973, American archaeologists Yosihiko H. Sinoto and Patrick C. McCoy discovered bone fragments of domesticated dogs and pigs in the early settlements of Vaiato'oia (near Fa'ahia) on the island of Huahine.

These dogs were used for both companionship and food and were introduced alongside poultry and pigs to various islands. They became extinct as a result of the cross-breeding that occurred after other breeds of dogs were introduced. Modern studies done on the DNA of the Polynesian dogs indicate that they descended from the domesticated dogs of Southeast Asia and may have shared a remote ancestor with the dingo. Taxonomy In 1839, the British naturalist Charles Hamilton Smith gave this dog the scientific name of Canis pacificus in his 1840 book The Natural History of Dogs: Canidae Or Genus Canis of Authors; Including Also the Genera Hyaena and Proteles. In the third edition of Mammal Species of the World published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed under the wolf Canis lupus the taxon \\"familiaris Linneaus, 1758 [domestic dog]\\". Wozencraft then listed Canis pacificus C. E. H. Smith, 1839 as junior taxonomic synonym for the domestic dog.  History and distribution  These dogs were introduced by the ancestors of the Polynesian people during their settlement of the far-flung islands with a few major archipelagos developing isolated breeds. Notable breeds include: *Hawaiian Poi Dog ‚Äì introduced to the Hawaiian Islands *Kurƒ´ ‚Äì introduced to New Zealand *Marquesan Dog ‚Äì introduced to the Marquesas Islands *Tahitian Dog ‚Äì introduced to the Society Islands **Tuamotuan Dog ‚Äì introduced to the Tuamotus, this may have been a longer- haired version of the Tahitian Dog. Described by British naturalist Georg Forster. Kurƒ´ specimen, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, 1924 The distribution of Polynesian dogs on other islands was somewhat patchy. Islands like Mangareva, Tokelau and the Marquesas possessed domesticated dog populations after initial settlement that went extinct before the arrival of European explorers. On Easter Island, no evidence or traces of dogs have been found in middens around the island or in the oral tradition of the Rapa Nui people. They were virtually absent from Western Polynesia (i.e., Samoa and Tonga) by the time Europeans arrived. However, dogs brought on European ships were recognized by the natives when they were introduced as items of trade, indicating a universal cultural recognition of dogs across the islands. While MƒÅori brought dogs to New Zealand, the Moriori had no dogs in the Chatham Islands at the time of European discovery.  Relationship to humans  The Polynesians raised dogs for companionship and food. Along with domesticated pigs and chickens, dog meat was an important animal protein source for the human populations of Polynesia. For the most part, they were fed a vegetarian diet of either breadfruits, coconuts, yams or poi made from taro, while the larger Kurƒ´ predominantly subsisted on a diet of fish. They never became feral because of the scarcity of food in the native forests. The diet and environment of the islands resulted in a dog with small stature and a docile disposition, and European explorers described them as lazy. They were said to rarely bark, but would howl occasionally. The distinct breeds of the Polynesian Dog became extinct between the 19th and early 20th centuries due to interbreeding with introduced European dog breeds; the declining consumption of dog meat was another contributing factor.  In mythology  Dogs were an important part of the Polynesian narrative. They are often associated with the legendary exploits of the demigod MƒÅui. According to MƒÅori narrative, MƒÅui transformed his brother-in-law Irawaru, husband of Hina, into the first dog which was used to explain the human characteristics of dogs. In the Tongan narrative, Maui-Atalaga and his son/brother Maui-Kijikiji attempted to hunt down Fulububuta, an enormous man-eating dog, larger than a horse, living in a cave on the Fijian island of Moturiki. However, Atalaga is killed and dragged into a cave by the monster, which is later slain by Maui-Kijikiji, who wastes away mourning his dead father.  Genetic studies  Proposed route for the migration of dogs based on mDNA. Haplotype A29 relates most to the Australian Dingo and the New Guinea Singing Dog, the ancient Polynesian Arc2 to modern Polynesian, Indonesian and ancient New Zealand dogs, and the ancient Polynesian Arc1 is indistinguishable from a number of widespread modern haplotypes. DNA evidence indicates that Polynesian dogs descended from the domesticated dogs of Southeast Asia and may have shared a remote ancestor with the dingo. The study of mtDNA show they carried two haplotypes: Arc1 and Arc2. In 2011, the mDNA of dogs from the Malay Peninsula found that the two most common dog haplotypes of the Indonesian region, in particular Bali and Kalimantan, were mDNA haplotype A75 (40%) and \\"the dingo founder haplotype\\" A29 (8%). Also present were haplotypes A120 and A145. All 4 haplotypes fall within the a2 mDNA sub-haplogroup. The study also looked at archaeological specimens of ancient Polynesian dogs from which only a \\"short-haplotype\\" (a short sequence) could be derived. This short haplotype was named Arc2 and corresponds to mDNA haplotypes A75 and A120, and it could be found in 70% of samples found as far away as Hawaii and New Zealand. No dogs from Taiwan nor the Philippines carried the dingo or Polynesian haplotypes, which indicates that dogs did not enter the Pacific from a northeastern route. In 2015, a study looked at the mDNA sequences taken from ancient New Zealand Kurƒ´ dog samples discovered at an archaeological site at Wairau Bar and found they correspond to the a2 mDNA sub-haplogroup. The dog samples all carried the mDNA haplotype A192, which has only been reported in some modern village dogs from Bali, Indonesia. When compared with the two ancient Polynesian haplotypes Arc1 and Arc2, all of the Wairau Bar dogs matched Arc2. Dogs from Wairau Bar likely represent part of the initial population of dogs introduced to New Zealand, having arrived with people around the beginning of the fourteenth century. All of these dogs carry haplotypes that fall under the mDNA a2 sub-haplogroup and are therefore descendants of a dog/Chinese wolf hybrid ancestor. In 2015, the most comprehensive study of mDNA haplotypes to date found that the a2 sub- haplogroup represents 3% of all dogs in Southeast Asia, 22% in the Indian subcontinent and 16% in East Asia. =Dogs enter Oceania from southern China= In 2020, an mDNA study of ancient dog fossils from the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins of southern China showed that most of the ancient dogs fell within mDNA haplogroup A1b, as do the Australian dingoes and the pre-colonial dogs of the Pacific, but in low frequency in China today. The specimen from the Tianluoshan archaeological site, Zhejiang province dates to 7,000 YBP and is basal to the entire lineage. The dogs belonging to this haplogroup were once widely distributed in southern China, then dispersed through Southeast Asia into New Guinea and Oceania, but were replaced in China 2,000 YBP by dogs of other lineages.

Municipal elections in California are officially non-partisan, though some candidates do receive funding and support from various political parties.

Casady was considered the strongest challenger to Wilson's attempt at a third term. Although the position of mayor is officially non-partisan, Casady, a liberal Democrat and long-time activist, hoped to run a partisan campaign against Wilson.

He is the Founder and President of Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research, and an Adjunct Professor of Islamic Studies at Southern Methodist University. He is currently the Resident Scholar of the Valley Ranch Islamic Center and the Co-Chair Emeritus of Faith Forward Dallas at Thanks-Giving Square, a multi-faith coalition of clergy for peace and justice. His opinion pieces have appeared in CNN, USA Today, The Guardian, HuffPost, and The Dallas Morning News among other outlets. Early life and education Suleiman was born to a Palestinian family in New Orleans in 1986. His studies of the Islamic tradition have taken Suleiman across the Muslim world to countries including Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, and Malaysia. In addition to receiving traditional certifications in the Islamic sciences, he received a Bachelor's in Islamic Law, Masters in Islamic Finance and Political History, and he completed a doctoral studies in Islamic Thought and Civilization from the International Islamic University of Malaysia. Career Upon returning to New Orleans, he served as the Imam of the Jefferson Muslim Association for 6 years, and as director of the ‚ÄúMuslims for Humanity‚Äù Hurricane Katrina relief effort in late 2005. It was at this time he received national recognition for his community service, interfaith, and social justice efforts. He co-founded the East Jefferson Interfaith Clergy Association and was awarded for outstanding civic achievement by the Mayor and City Council of New Orleans in 2010. In 2016, Suleiman founded the Muslim think-tank, Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research. He is also the founding director of MUHSEN (Muslims Understanding and Helping Special Education Needs) - a non-profit umbrella organization that aims to create more inclusive Muslim communities that better cater to the disabled and their families. He is () Professor of Islamic Studies at Southern Methodist University. He was () Resident Scholar of the Valley Ranch Islamic Center and Co-Chair of Faith Forward Dallas at Thanks-Giving Square. Omar Suleiman also starred in the award-winning Inspiration Series which aimed at imparting moral lessons from the life and example of the Prophet Muhammad through a drama mini-series. The series was widely viewed globally, and would go on to win the award for Best Movie at the 2016 International Contribution to Dawah Awards in Dubai. Activism Suleiman has engaged in social justice organizing and activism on a host of progressive causes. He states that Donald Trump's presidency \\"fatigues\\" American citizens. He also \\"considers [himself] a student of Malcolm X\\" and believes that \\"his most important contribution to the revolution is his idea that the greatest casualty of the subjugation of African Americans was the loss of black consciousness.‚Äù He has expressed that \\"America is a work in progress, and the most patriotic Americans are those that demand it live up to its promise.\\" He also believes that \\"Muslim theology can be a source of liberation.\\" In July 2016, he marched with demonstrators in Dallas against the killings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. These demonstrations would eventually be punctuated by a deadly shooting in which five police officers were killed in retaliation for police shootings of African Americans. Suleiman recalls \\"an eternity of gunshots\\" ringing out just as the march came to a close. In the wake of the shooting, Imam Omar Suleiman was invited to lead the invocation at a memorial service for the slain officers attended by President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and his wife Jill Biden, as well as President George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush. Since 2015, Suleiman has frequently visited Syrian refugee camps delivering aid with the Muslim humanitarian relief group, Helping Hand for Relief and Development. Suleiman led airport demonstrations in Dallas in reaction to the Trump travel ban, which has since come to be known as the ‚ÄúMuslim ban\\" due to its restricting immigration from 7 predominantly Muslim- majority nations, as well as Trump's call for a temporary ban on Muslim entry into the United States following the 2015 San Bernardino attack, and again after the Orlando nightclub shooting. In 2017, Omar Suleiman was arrested on Capitol Hill protesting outside of the office of then-House Speaker Congressman Paul Ryan. He had been participating in sit-in demonstration calling for comprehensive immigration reform. He later led a group of clergy to the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border to protest in solidarity with and meet migrants affected by Trump's family separation policy. He has also worked to assist families of victims of police brutality, voiced support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and underscored the importance of anti-racism work more broadly. =Threat from ISIS= In March 2017, ISIS called for his assassination, among a number of other prominent Western Muslim faith leaders, in a propaganda film titled \\"Kill The Apostate Imams.\\" The call was in response to a video Suleiman produced with Pastor Andrew Stoker of First United Methodist Church Dallas titled \\"An Imam, a Pastor and a Dream,‚Äù in which he calls for unity between Christians and Muslims in the United States and around the world. Suleiman responded to the threat stating, \\"I believe that their venom needs to be condemned. They‚Äôve hijacked my religion.\\" Recognition Imam Omar Suleiman has been noted for his work in the fields of community service, interfaith dialogue, and social justice, and was awarded for outstanding civic achievement by the Mayor and City Council of New Orleans in 2010. He was featured as ‚Äúrising star‚Äù in Ozy Magazine and dubbed \\"The Religious Leader Dallas Needs\\" by the D Magazine. Suleiman was also the subject of a BBC documentary in 2016 highlighting the experience of Muslims in Texas facing rising Islamophobia, and a 2017 PBS documentary showcasing his work with Syrian refugees. On May 9, 2019, Suleiman served as the congressional guest chaplain upon the invitation of Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson and delivered the day's opening invocation. In addition to being recognized by CNN as one of 25 Muslim American change-makers, Suleiman was also included in The Muslim 500 - an annual ranking of the world's most influential Muslims compiled by the Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre in Amman, Jordan. He also serves in an ethical advisory capacity within Muslim financial groups including the investment and wealth management firm, ShariaPortfolio, as well as A Continuous Charity - an organization aimed at promoting interest-free student loans for Muslims across North America. In observation of Frederick Douglass' bicentennial, the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University and Frederick Douglass Family Initiatives recognized Omar Suleiman among 200 honorees whose work was deemed to best embody the legacy of the abolitionist‚Äôs commitment to social change.

The organization, headquartered in Sacramento, was founded by 6 counties (Sacramento, Colusa, Yuba, Yolo, Sutter and Glenn) but came to comprise representatives from 6 more (Solano, Butte, Shasta, Placer, El Dorado and Tehama), each selected by their respective county supervisor. It remained operational and influential until 1925 when the Sacramento Valley Regional Advisory for the larger California Development Association filled the void.https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d;=LMJ19250313.1.2 History President Will S. Green, former State Treasurer, Surveyor General and Assemblyman Upon suggestion from local Woodland attorney C.W. Thomas, former Colusa mayor Will S. Green called on the Colusa County Board of Trade to request a meeting of delegates to the inaugural Sacramento Valley Irrigation Convention. On January 15 and 16, 1900, delegates from six counties gathered in Woodland where they formally elected General Green, a renowned state politician and fierce advocate for Central Valley irrigation, as President, a capacity in which he served until his death in 1905. Another meeting would be held soon afterward in Oroville to formalize the proceedings and make permanent the renamed Sacramento Valley Development Association, then headquartered in Colusa. The office was moved once more to Sacramento in 1903, where a building had been erected near the Southern Pacific train depot specifically for the group's purpose. =Leadership= Hon. Marshall Diggs, 1906 candidate for Governor and 2nd President of the Sacramento Valley Development Association After General Green's death in 1905, Yolo County Democratic state senator (1903‚Äì1907) Marshall Diggs was elected President (with widespread support), an office which he held for over 16 years. His director turned co-vice president for a time was C.H. Dunton. Dunton was an invaluable aide, if not partner, to Diggs. Although the two men hailed from different parts of Northern California (Dunton was from El Dorado) and different political parties, the two were a formidable duo. Different as the two were, both were widely respected across the state. As proof, Diggs had been considered for the governorship in 1906, Dunton the lieutenant governorship in 1914. However, unlike Dunton, who had served as delegate to the state convention and on a committee to the National Irrigation Congress, Diggs wasn't particularly keen on politics. Diggs was \\"a business man, pure and simple\\", who \\"continually expressed a desire to get back to his ranch and to his business.\\" Together they arranged meetings and luncheons with some of California's most influential so that, for example, members of the Commonwealth Club of California were there to hear Dunton's talk on \\"The Relationship of San Francisco to the Development of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys\\" During his tenure, Biggs was chosen by Dunton to serve on the Northern California Development League's 15-man conference committee, which he chaired, in order to unite the disparate organizations working to promote Northern California. The irony in Dunton and Biggs' close involvement is that the decision to create such a League in the first place had been opposed principally by some members of their own organization, the Sacramento Valley Development Association. They agreed with Colonel John P. Irish, a member of the California Development Board, that the newly found organization of 33 counties was itself unnecessary. Irish contended at the organizing conference in Marysville that it would really only duplicate work of existing organizations which had already helped Northern California prosper as much as the southern part of the state. Nevertheless, the conference, which focused on the method of advertising by which the most northern counties could be better brought into the fold and how Northern California could compete with Southern California for tourists, immigrants and consumers, was a success and convinced most of the prospective League members it was a good idea. After his reelection as President for the 16th straight year in 1921, Diggs stepped down in January 1922, at which time Vice President W.A. Beard took over. With the exception of time spent on his run as the Democratic nominee for California's 2nd congressional district, Beard had served continuously within the organization (manager, secretary, editor and vice president) since 1905. =Fundraising= With their organizational structure set after the Oroville meeting, the most daunting challenge the Association faced was the raising of funds. The financial situation was so dire that Green himself travelled the valley appealing to county supervisors for $50 apiece. Working within these economic limitations, the group threw its moral weight behind an education campaign regarding the unique opportunities and advantages of the region. They took actions to negotiate the subdivision of a large ranch in Glenn County, secure reports on irrigation possibilities from the Department of Agriculture and induce the Geological Survey to send experts to map sites for storage reservoirs (the first study of water storage problems in the valley). Such barebones campaigning wasn't sustainable, however, so a permanent rule was implemented that required each participating county to contribute one-half cent for every one hundred dollars of assessed valuation. In April 1910, they partnered with the Sacramento Realty Board, who pledged $10,000 to the Association's proposed five year, $50,000 per year campaign for the development of the valley. The first three years went towards an advertising campaign until the association established a magazine which they published for six years after that. =Initiated and supported projects= As early as 1905, the Association had been pushing Congress for a comprehensive Sacramento Valley Project with a price tag of $40 million. With only $28 million in the Reclamation Fund at the time, the pitch was never plausible but, in his last public activity, Green managed to bring members of the Irrigation Committees of the United States Senate and House of Representatives, accompanied by officials of the Department of the Interior and of the Reclamation Service, out for a two-day tour of the Sacramento Valley's current irrigation situation. At their most important stop in Red Bluff, a banquet was held, during which California Gov. George C. Pardee, Nevada Sen. Francis G. Newlands, Idaho Sen. Fred Dubois, California Reps. Duncan E. McKinlay and Theodore Arlington Bell, Wyoming Rep. Franklin Wheeler Mondell and California Sen. Frank Putnam Flint all spoke. However, it was Green who, weeks from death, stole the show. Detailing the aims and intentions of the Association, he recognized how little work had actually yet been accomplished before finishing with a singular wish: \\"But, gentlemen, my only hope, as I am on the decline of life, is that some day I may stand on Pisgah An allusion to the biblical Mount Pisgah, from where Moses was shown the Promised Land which he would not enter. and see a Promised Land for God's people in this valley. Then I will be ready to die.\\" File:Woodland Geological Survey.jpgWoodland Geological Survey (February 1907) File:East Park Dam near Orland, California.jpgEast Park Dam near Orland (1915) File:Creamery and Horticulture buildings, UC Davis (postcard).jpgCreamery and Horticulture buildings, University Farm at Davis (between 1910 and 1923) File:Image from page 85 of \\"California highways; a descriptive record of road development by the state and by such counties as have paved highways\\" (1920) (14780948772).jpgSurfacing the Yolo Causeway (between 1914 and 1916) File:Lassen Volcanic Natl Park poster 1938.jpgLassen Volcanic National Park poster (1938) Green never saw the completion of it, but one of his organization's early successes was the approval of the Orland Project on December 18, 1906, the result of letters from various officers throughout the years 1902 to 1905 as well as a petition from owners of over 40,000 acres of land conveyed through the Sacramento Valley Development Association to the Secretary of the Interior Ethan A. Hitchcock. Less than four years later, the East Park Dam had been constructed on Stony Creek, the Sacramento River's principal tributary from the west, along with a spillway, dikes and a system of canals capable of irrigating 53,000 acres 210 days out of the year. Proposed Iron Canyon Reservoir with approximate canal line to a point near Red Bluff (1919) In September 1908, the Association called for a meeting of delegates across the state to discuss plans for improving the highways of California. An earlier suggested plan, which had yet to be enacted was proposed at the meeting by the Governor's secretary in his stead. It called for an $18 million bond to construct 3000 miles of roads including highways across the tules between Davis and Sacramento as well as a state highway connection from Folsom to Placerville. The passage of the State Highways Act in 1909 and subsequent success of Proposition 2, The California State Highway Bonds Proposition, just over two years after the original meeting, provided $18 million in funds. This started the construction of 3,000 miles of roads including the Yolo Causeway in 1914 and the portion of U.S. Route 50 (then State Route 11) connecting Folsom and Placerville sometime before that. The road up the Feather River Canyon (now the northern part of California State Route 49) was also touted as a critical trans-Sierra highway. In 1905, at the urging of fellow Yolo County leaders, Marshall Diggs (still state senator) sponsored the State Farm Bill of 1905 which selected Davisville as the site for the University of California's new State Farmers' Institute, an adjunct to the university's College of Agriculture. He and his fellow Yolo County leaders infamously had a hand in pushing Judge Peter J. Shields to pin a blue slip to the bill, which added an irrigation requirement disqualifying more than a dozen other locations (many in Southern California) but not Davisville. Three years later, on behalf of the Sacramento Valley Development Association, Diggs spoke with his predecessor in the state senate A.E. Boynton, U.S. Representatives Benjamin Franklin Rush and Horace Davis as well as UC Berkeley President Benjamin Ide Wheeler on the campus pavilion for the formal opening of short instructional classes open to all adults of at least 17 years of age. The Association strongly supported the passage of John E. Raker's H.R. 348 bill, which created Lassen Volcanic National Park, even though it was criticized by some conservationists as a way to siphon federal funds to subsidize roads. The last large undertaking championed by the Association and President W.A. Beard's crowning achievement was the Iron Canyon Project on the upper Sacramento River, which would help to supply water for irrigation across 225,000 acres of land from Red Bluff to Glenn County west of the river. Beard and his director, A.L. Conrad, testified at a consequential record of public hearing in 1916 against opposition that wished to keep the river navigable up to Red Bluff year round. Beard, hyperbolic as always, cited \\"how [they were] sufficiently near to justify the War Department in providing us with this information\\", by which he meant the amount of water needed for storage and navigation. He emphasized the fact that development would reach its maximum output soon if storage capacity weren't increased, while others pointed to the decreasing navigability of the riverbed and banks. In the end, inertia and a Shasta County Board of Supervisors campaign against the plan was enough to stall it for years to come. The Association soon dissolved itself and many of its members became founders of the Sacramento Valley Regional Advisory Council to the larger California Development Association, while Beard worked for several more years as the President of the Iron Canyon Project Association in an effort to secure federal aid.https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/95888126/ Publications and publicity The Great West: A Journal of Development and Progress (September 1909) The Development Association also published regular literature to promote their endeavors and attract consumers from within and to the area. Their very first venture was a 40-page illustrated article outlining the climate, soil, resources and advantages of all nine member counties. It was decided in December 1900 that their first buy would be in Sunset, a South Pacific-owned magazine aimed at promoting the West. Including the 15,000 copies printed by the State Board of Trade, 25,000 reached circulation in early 1901. Later in the year, they published an article in 30,000 copies of the Overland Monthly, along with 10,000 in pamphlet form. Most of these early pamphlets were written by President Green himself under straightforward titles such as \\"Northern California and the Sacramento Valley\\" or \\"The Sacramento Valley as a field for profitable investment\\", while others embellished \\"The Best Spot on Earth is the Sacramento Valley\\". One pamphlet from 1911 boasted of \\"one of the great valleys of the world, with a vast and fertile soil area. It produces great quantities of precious metals and structural materials. It is blessed with an abundant water supply, and an agriculture much more diversified than is found anywhere else on the face of the earth.\\" =Monthly journals= In 1902, the association published a booster periodical called the Wednesday Press, which was renamed The Great West in October 1907 by manager turned editor W.A. Beard. As a booster, he tracked Sacramento's progress from what he called \\"one of the most backward and unprogressive cities on the entire Pacific Coast\\" to one in which \\"the population ... business ... property values have increased and every prominent interest in the city has been infused with life.\\" He signaled the dawn of a new era with headlines that alluded to science, \\"Substantial Evidence of Sacramento's New Growth\\", and faith, \\"Sacramento's New Awakening\\". At this, he'd been a natural since his days as secretary-manager: In truth, Redding did not grow to over 4,000 inhabitants until 1930, but the narrative helped Beard, on behalf of the Association, make the demand for \\"the gridironing of the valley with railroads\\" among other things. Sacramento Valley Monthly (1915) Prominent Catholic journalist and booster Thomas Augustus Connelly also worked for a time as an associate editor under Beard and played a role in the name change. While most of his work was spent promoting the economic interests and growth of the area, he also covered its social development in pieces like \\"Sacramento's Numerous and Beautiful Church Structures\\", in which he highlighted each of the city's established denominations. Like the Great West, the Sacramento Valley Monthly focused on educational writing for a wide variety of agricultural topics such as sanitation, reclamation, irrigation, navigation, tributaries, dams, reservoirs, power, maps, hunting and fishing, but they also dabbled in tourism, education and immigration. Ads and coupons for railroad companies, land, banks/loans, cattle and crops were also largely the same. The biggest difference was the fact that the Great West was more than 30 pages longer. The extra space was used to feature projects, cities and counties and to expand its advertisements to physicians, grocers, hotels and even funeral directors. Both publications also often highlighted success stories of farmers and laborers who had come to the Sacramento Valley from the midwest and east for a better life. One told of a man who moved from Moore, Oklahoma to Glenn County, another of an Illinois man who settled in Elk Grove, the latter of whom spoke of satisfaction owing to a quick 11% return on his investment and a friendly climate. =Great Prune Bear= Lewis and Clark Exposition, Portland, Oregon. The Great Prune Bear presented by Sacramento County (1905) One of the association's special promotional projects which gained brief national attention made its debut at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis. The \\"Great Prune Bear\\", as they called it, was a life-sized bear made entirely of prunes adorned with gleaming teeth and flashing electric eyes, which attracted visitors and photographers from all over. Each was given a folder on the advantages of the area and asked to estimate the number of fruits used in the bear's creation. As California became an agricultural powerhouse, the valley was transitioning to fruits and vegetables, hence why the much maligned prune was marketed so heavily. The next year, the same groups were granted $100,000 by the state legislature to represent the Sacramento Valley and California at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland, Oregon. Having received their own building this time around, many California exhibits embellished upon the last year's display. Yet, according to a final report by the state itself, none featured more items than Sacramento County, which included a 12-foot high mural of the Great Seal of California made entirely of beans, a model of the California State Capitol constructed of nuts and a pyramid of beer bottles from the Buffalo Brewery in the shape of a giant beer bottle. But, of course, none received as much publicity as the upgraded Great Prune Bear, located on the central rotunda and now featuring a graphophone in its jaws.

Lawton was an American jurist and politician who served as a probate judge in Plymouth County, Massachusetts, member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, and a Brockton city councilor. Early life Lawton was born on October 20, 1925 in Brockton to Irish immigrant parents. In 1931, Lawton's father was killed by a hit-and-run driver who was never apprehended. During his youth, Lawton did impersonations of public figures, including Adolf Hitler, Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Eleanor Roosevelt, for money. He attended Brockton High School until his junior year, when he left to enlist in the United States Army. He served in the 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment. On March 24, 1945 he participated in Operation Varsity, the final Allied airborne invasion of Europe. Six days later he was seriously wounded in action in Munster. He spent the next eighteen months in Army hospitals and was discharged in November 1946. He then returned to Brockton High School and graduated. He went on to earn degrees from Suffolk University and Portia Law School (later known as New England School of Law). Political career In 1947, Lawton was elected to the Brockton City Council. At the age of 22 he was the youngest councilor ever elected in the history of Brockton. In 1950, Lawton was an unsuccessful candidate for a seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He ran again two years later and this time was successful. At the time, he was one of the few Democrats from Plymouth County to serve on Beacon Hill. During his tenure in the House, Lawton served on the Ways & Means Committee, chaired the Committee on Bills in Third Reading, and served as House Chairman on the Commission to Redistrict Legislative, Council & Congressional seats. In 1960, Lawton was a last-minute candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts. He showed surprising strength on the first ballot at the Democratic convention, but did not win the party's endorsement. After the convention, Lawton decided that he would run for Attorney General of Massachusetts in 1962 if there was a vacancy. He won the endorsement of the Massachusetts Democratic Party at the party convention, but lost the nomination to Francis E. Kelly in the primary election. In 1963, Lawton became legislative secretary to governor Endicott Peabody. That May, Peabody appointed Lawton to the position of Registrar of Motor Vehicles. During his tenure as Registrar, Lawton supported mandatory use of seat belts, licensing for auto mechanics, compulsory vehicle inspections, and retraining for drivers with frequent violations. He also took a stand against public officials who sought to have their constituents' traffic tickets \\"fixed\\". Legal career In October 1964, Peabody appointed Lawton to the Plymouth County Probate Court. In February 1995, Lawton presided over a child custody case involving 10-year-old identical twin girls. After consulting with both children, he found that found that one of the girls strongly desired to live with their mother while the other expressed a very strong desire to live with their father. Lawton decided to accommodated the children and ruled that one girl should live with their mother and the other should live with their father. The decision gained national attention and lingered in court until 1998, when a different judge placed both twins with their mother. Lawton remained a judge until October 20, 1995, when he reached the mandatory retirement age of seventy. From 1969 until his death, Lawton was Chairman of the Board of Trustees of his alma mater, the New England School of Law. During his tenure, the school moved from Beacon Hill to Newbury Street and then from Newbury Street to the Boston Theater District. Personal life and death On October 16, 1948, Lawton married Jeanne Cashman in Brockton. They had five sons, one of whom, Mark Lawton, also served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives and as a state court judge. On February 3, 2007, Lawton fell and broke his hip at his Brockton home. He never recovered and died in Brockton Hospital on March 20.

Rusch was nominated to the international Mountain Bike Hall of Fame in 2019, owns seven World Championship titles in multiple disciplines and was a member of the US National Whitewater Rafting Team as well as several international adventure racing teams, participating in the Eco Challenge (1997‚Äì2002), Primal Quest (2002‚Äì2006) and Raid Gauloises (2000, 2002, 2003) series.  Personal life  Rusch was born August 25, 1968 in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico to Stephen Rusch and Judy Tomlinson Rusch. Her father, a US Air Force F-4 pilot, was shot down during combat in the Vietnam War in 1972 when Rusch was 3 years old. She has an older sister, USAF Brigadier Gen. Sharon Bannister. Rusch attended college at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where she studied business marketing. Rusch married Greg Martin in September 2014; Martin is an engineer firefighter for the Ketchum fire department and accomplished mountain biker and outdoorsman. Rusch, Martin and their dogs Diesel & Gracie reside in Ketchum, Idaho.  Event Production & Activism  Rated a Top 5 gravel event by Global Cycling Network and one of the 25 Best Bike Rides in the World by Outside Magazine, Rebecca's Private Idaho has been staged every Labor Day weekend since 2013 in Rusch's hometown and surrounding Idaho backcountry. Conceived and reconned by Rusch, produced in partnership with her sponsors, the gravel grinder, stage race and outdoor festival benefits local, national and global charities: the [Wood River Trails Coalition; the Idaho chapter of the National Interscholastic Cycling Association; People for Bikes and World Bicycle Relief. RPI, along with other cycling clinics, camps and guided tours coordinated and led by Rusch (including Rusch Academy and MTB Lao), plus adventures like mountain biking up and down Mount Kilimanjaro have raised over $500k to date in support of select nonprofits. Rusch established the Be Good Foundation, a 501(c)3 nonprofit, in honor of her father Capt. Stephen A. Rusch, who signed his letters home from Vietnam using those two words. Its mission is to enrich communities by using the bicycle as a catalyst for healing, empowerment and evolution and to create opportunities for outdoor exploration, personal discovery and humanitarian service. Priorities include removal of UXO, or unexploded ordnance, throughout Laos; protecting public lands for recreation and access; and partnering with other cycling-related nonprofits to fund impactful change. Rusch has partnered with Mines Advisory Group (MAG) and jewelry company Article22 to support UXO mitigation efforts.  Author: Rusch to Glory  Rusch to Glory: Adventure, Risk & Triumph on the Path Less Traveled, published August 2014 by VeloPress and written by Rusch with Selene Yeager, chronicles her journey from rookie suburban high school cross-country runner to World Champion endurance athlete, and all the adventures in between. Set in the exotic locales and extreme conditions that forged an extraordinary athlete from ordinary roots‚Äîtrekking through Borneo, mountain climbing in Patagonia, navigating the rivers of Vietnam, racing bikes across the Andes‚ÄîRusch's rambling led to a successful career in ultra adventure racing, but when the TV cameras dropped out and sponsorship dollars followed, Rusch's story carried on. \\"At age 38, Rusch faced a tough decision: retire or reinvent herself yet again. Determined to go for broke, she shifted her focus to endurance mountain bike racing and rode straight into the record books at a moment when most athletes walk away. Rusch to Glory is more than an epic story of adventure; it is a testament to the rewards of hard work, determination, and resilience on the long road to personal and professional triumph.\\"  Public Speaking & Media  Accepted as a presenter at the inaugural TEDxSunValley event, Rusch spoke to a hometown crowd of 300 on November 30, 2016. \\"Navigating Home\\", her 17-minute address, can be viewed on Rusch's YouTube channel. On May 27, 2019, Rusch and her sister Brig. Gen. Sharon Bannister were invited to be co-keynote speakers in Washington DC by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, dedicated to remembering those who served in the USA armed forces in Vietnam and to maintaining the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Rusch counted it as \\"the most important speech of our lives, sharing our parallel stories of finding Dad and keeping his memory and impact alive. Through the loss of one family member, we have gained thousands of new family members who have also been touched by loss.\\" Outside TV has broadcast a 3-part documentary miniseries following Rusch and fellow explorer Steve \\"Doom\\" Fassbinder over 6 days of mountain biking, rock climbing, canyoneering and packrafting in Utah's Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante National Monuments with the intent to promote preservation of public lands. Outside TV also captured the Iditarod Trail Invitational as Rusch, in her first attempt at the race, completed 350 miles as the first female finisher in a self- supported wilderness bikepacking venture through Alaskan wilderness in subzero temperatures. These efforts and more are discussed in a Rich Roll podcast. An ultra athlete and author, Roll says, \\"Rebecca‚Äôs accomplishments are beyond impressive. But our conversation lives beyond elite performance to explore things like curiosity. The richness of adventure. Feeding the soul. Continuous personal growth. Redefining age. Contributing to the greater good. And giving back. Most of all, this is about what can be gleaned by leaning into the unknown. And living outside the comfort zone.

This means that there is no oxygen (O2) and a raised level of free hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Euxinic bodies of water are frequently strongly stratified, have an oxic, highly productive, thin surface layer, and have anoxic, sulfidic bottom water. The word euxinia is derived from the Greek name for the Black Sea (Œï·ΩîŒæŒµŒπŒΩŒøœÇ Œ†œåŒΩœÑŒøœÇ (Euxeinos Pontos)) which translates to \\"hospitable sea\\". Euxinic deep water is a key component of the Canfield ocean, a model of oceans during the Proterozoic period (known as the Boring Billion) proposed by Donald Canfield, an American geologist, in 1998. There is still debate within the scientific community on both the duration and frequency of euxinic conditions in the ancient oceans. Euxinia is relatively rare in modern bodies of water, but does still happen in places like the Black Sea and certain fjords.  Background  Euxinia most frequently occurred in the Earth's ancient oceans, but its distribution and frequency of occurrence are still under debate. The original model was that it was quite constant for approximately a billion years. Some meta-analyses have questioned how persistent euxinic conditions were based on relatively small black shale deposits in a period when the ocean should have theoretically been preserving more organic matter. Before the Great Oxygenation Event happened approximately 2.3 billion years ago, there was little free oxygen in either the atmosphere or the ocean. It was originally thought that the ocean accumulated oxygen soon after the atmosphere did, but this idea was challenged by Canfield in 1998 when he proposed that instead of the deep ocean becoming oxidizing, it became sulfidic. This hypothesis is partially based on the disappearance of banded iron formations from the geological records 1.8 billion years ago. Canfield argued that although enough oxygen entered the atmosphere to erode sulfides in continental rocks, there was not enough oxygen to mix into the deep ocean. This would result in an anoxic deep ocean with an increased flux of sulfur from the continents. The sulfur would strip iron ions from the sea water, resulting in iron sulfide (pyrite), a portion of which was eventually buried. When sulfide became the major oceanic reductant instead of iron, the deep water became euxinic. This has become what is known as the Canfield ocean, a model backed by the increase in presence of Œ¥34S in sedimentary pyrite and the discovery of evidence of the first sulfate evaporites. Anoxia and sulfidic conditions often occur together. In anoxic conditions anaerobic, sulfate reducing bacteria convert sulfate into sulfide, creating sulfidic conditions. The emergence of this metabolic pathway was very important in the pre-oxygenated oceans because adaptations to otherwise inhabitable or \\"toxic\\" environments like this may have played a role in the diversification of early eukaryotes and protozoa in the pre-Phanerozoic. Euxinia still occurs occasionally today, mostly in meromictic lakes and silled basins such as the Black Sea and some fjords. It is rare in modern times; less than 0.5% of today's sea floor is euxinic.  Causes  Diagram of mechanisms of euxinia in the Canfield Ocean The basic requirements for the formation of euxinic conditions are the absence of oxygen (O2), and the presence of sulfate ions (SO42‚àí), organic matter (CH2O), and bacteria capable of reducing sulfate to hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The bacteria utilize the redox potential of sulfate as an oxidant and organic matter as a reductant to generate chemical energy through cellular respiration. The chemical species of interest can be represented via the reaction: 2CH2O + SO42‚àí ‚Üí H2S + 2HCO3‚àí In the reaction above, the sulfur has been reduced to form the byproduct hydrogen sulfide, the characteristic compound present in water under euxinic conditions. Although sulfate reduction occurs in waters throughout the world, most modern-day aquatic habitats are oxygenated due to photosynthetic production of oxygen and gas exchange between the atmosphere and surface water. Sulfate reduction in these environments is often limited to occurring in seabed sediments that have a strong redox gradient and become anoxic at some depth below the sediment-water interface. In the ocean the rate of these reactions is not limited by sulfate, which has been present in large quantities throughout the oceans for the past 2.1 billion years. The Great Oxygenation Event increased atmospheric oxygen concentrations such that oxidative weathering of sulfides became a major source of sulfate to the ocean. Despite plentiful sulfate ions being present in solution, they are not preferentially used by most bacteria. The reduction of sulfate does not give as much energy to an organism as reduction of oxygen or nitrate, so the concentrations of these other elements must be nearly zero for sulfate- reducing bacteria to out-compete aerobic and denitrifying bacteria. In most modern settings these conditions only occur in a small portion of sediments, resulting in insufficient concentrations of hydrogen sulfide to form euxinic waters. Conditions required for the formation of persistent euxinia include anoxic waters, high nutrient levels, and a stratified water column. These conditions are not all-inclusive and are based largely on modern observations of euxinia. Conditions leading up to and triggering large-scale euxinic events, such as the Canfield ocean, are likely the result of multiple interlinking factors, many of which have been inferred through studies of the geologic record at relevant locations. The formation of stratified anoxic waters with high nutrient levels is influenced by a variety of global and local-scale phenomena such as the presence of nutrient traps and a warming climate. = Nutrient traps = In order for euxinic conditions to persist, a positive feedback loop must perpetuate organic matter export to bottom waters and reduction of sulfate under anoxic conditions. Organic matter export is driven by high levels of primary production in the photic zone, supported by a continual supply of nutrients to the oxic surface waters. A natural source of nutrients, such as phosphate (), comes from weathering of rocks and subsequent transport of these dissolved nutrients via rivers. In a nutrient trap, increased input of phosphate from rivers, high rates of recycling of phosphate from sediments, and slow vertical mixing in the water column allow for euxinic conditions to persist.  Geography  A simplified model of estuarine circulation in a silled basin. Depicted here is a three-layered body of water which has been further simplified in the article by combining the intermediate and deep layers. The arrangement of the continents has changed over time due to plate tectonics, resulting in the bathymetry of ocean basins also changing over time. The shape and size of the basins influences the circulation patterns and concentration of nutrients within them. Numerical models simulating past arrangements of continents have shown that nutrient traps can form in certain scenarios, increasing local concentrations of phosphate and setting up potential euxinic conditions. On a smaller scale, silled basins often act as nutrient traps due to their estuarine circulation. Estuarine circulation occurs where surface water is replenished from river input and precipitation, causing an outflow of surface waters from the basin, while deep water flows into the basin over the sill. This type of circulation allows for anoxic, high nutrient bottom water to develop within the basin.  Stratification  Stratified waters, in combination with slow vertical mixing, are essential to maintaining euxinic conditions. Stratification occurs when two or more water masses with different densities occupy the same basin. While the less dense surface water can exchange gas with the oxygen-rich atmosphere, the denser bottom waters maintain low oxygen content. In the modern oceans, thermohaline circulation and upwelling prevent the oceans from maintaining anoxic bottom waters. In a silled basin, the stable stratified layers only allow surface water to flow out of the basin while the deep water remains anoxic and relatively unmixed. During an intrusion of dense saltwater however, the nutrient-rich bottom water upwells, causing increased productivity in the surface, further enhancing the nutrient trap due to biological pumping. Rising sea level can exacerbate this process by increasing the amount of deep water entering a silled basin and enhancing estuarine circulation. = Warming climate = A warming climate increases surface temperatures of waters which effects multiple aspects of euxinic water formation. As waters warm, the solubility of oxygen decreases, allowing for deep anoxic waters to form more readily. Additionally, the warmer water causes increased respiration of organic matter leading to further oxygen depletion. Higher temperatures enhance the hydrologic cycle, increasing evaporation from bodies of water, resulting in increased precipitation. This causes higher rates of weathering of rocks and therefore higher nutrient concentrations in river outflows. The nutrients allow for more productivity resulting in more marine snow and subsequently lower oxygen in deep waters due to increased respiration. Volcanism has also been proposed as a factor in creating euxinic conditions. The carbon dioxide (CO2) released during volcanic outgassing causes global warming which has cascading effects on the formation of euxinic conditions.  Evidence for euxinic events  = Black shale = Black shale is one of the preliminary indicators of anoxia and perhaps euxinia Black shales are organic rich, microlaminated sedimentary rocks often associated with bottom water anoxia. This is because anoxia slows the degradation of organic matter, allowing for greater burial in the sediments. Other evidence for anoxic burial of black shale includes the lack of bioturbation, meaning that there were no organisms burrowing into the sediment because there was no oxygen for respiration. There must also be a source of organic matter for burial, generally from production near the oxic surface. Many papers discussing ancient euxinic events use the presence of black shale as a preliminary proxy for anoxic bottom waters, but their presence does not in and of itself indicate euxinia or even strong anoxia. Generally geochemical testing is needed to provide better evidence for conditions. = Geochemistry = Some researchers study the occurrence of euxinia in ancient oceans because it was more prevalent then than it is today. Since ancient oceans cannot be directly observed, scientists use geology and chemistry to find evidence in sedimentary rock created under euxinic conditions. Some of these techniques come from studying modern examples of euxinia, while others are derived from geochemistry. Though modern euxinic environments have geochemical properties in common with ancient euxinic oceans, the physical processes causing euxinia most likely vary between the two.  Isotopes  Stable isotope ratios can be used to infer the environmental conditions during the formation of sedimentary rock. Using stoichiometry and knowledge of redox pathways, paleogeologists can use isotopes ratios of elements to determine the chemical composition of the water and sediments when burial occurred. Sulfur isotopes are frequently used to look for evidence of ancient euxinia. Low Œ¥34S in black shales and sedimentary rocks provides positive evidence for euxinic formation conditions. The pyrite (FeS2) in euxinic basins typically has higher concentrations of light sulfur isotopes than pyrite in the modern ocean. The reduction of sulfate to sulfide favors the lighter sulfur isotopes (32S) and becomes depleted in the heavier isotopes (34S). This lighter sulfide then bonds with Fe2+ to form FeS2 which is then partially preserved in the sediments. In most modern systems, sulfate eventually becomes limiting, and the isotopic weights of sulfur in both sulfate and sulfide (preserved as FeS2) become equal. Molybdenum (Mo), the most common transition metal ion in modern seawater, is also used to look for evidence for euxinia. Weathering of rocks provides an input of MoO42‚Äì into oceans. Under oxic conditions, MoO42‚Äì is very unreactive, but in modern euxinic environments such as the Black Sea, molybdenum precipitates out as oxythiomolybdate (MoO4‚àíxSx2‚Äì ). The isotope ratio for Molybdenum (Œ¥97/95 Mo) in euxinic sediments appears to be higher than in oxic conditions. Additionally, the concentration of molybdenum is frequently correlated with the concentration of organic matter in euxinic sediments. The use of Mo to indicate euxinia is still under debate.  Trace-element enrichment  Under euxinic conditions, some trace elements such as Mo, U, V, Cd, Cu, Tl, Ni, Sb, and Zn, become insoluble. This means that euxinic sediments would contain more of the solid form of these elements than the background seawater. For example, Molybdenum and other trace metals become insoluble in anoxic and sulfidic conditions, so over time the seawater becomes depleted of trace metals under conditions of persistent euxinia, and preserved sediments are relatively enriched with molybdenum and other trace elements.  Organic biomarkers  Pigments from purple and green sulfur reducing bacteria are strong evidence for euxinic conditions Bacteria such as green sulfur bacteria and purple sulfur bacteria, which exist where the photic zone overlaps with euxinic water masses, leave pigments behind in sediments. These pigments can be used to identify past euxinic conditions. The pigments used to identify past presence of green sulfur bacteria are chlorobactane and isorenieratene. The pigments used to identify past presence of purple sulfur bacteria is okenane.  Iron geochemistry  Pyrite (FeS2) is a mineral formed by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and bioreactive iron (Fe2+). In oxic bottom waters pyrite can only form in sediments where H2S is present. However, in iron-rich euxinic environments, pyrite formation can occur at higher rates in both the water column and in sediments due to higher concentrations of H2S. Therefore the presence of euxinic conditions can be inferred by the ratio of pyrite-bound iron to the total iron in sediments. High ratios of pyrite-bound iron can be used as an indicator of past euxinic conditions. Similarly, if >45% of the bioreactive iron in sediments is pyrite- bound, then anoxic or euxinic conditions can be inferred. While useful, these methods do not provide definitive proof of euxinia because not all euxinic waters have the same concentrations of bioreactive iron available. These relationships have been found to be present in the modern euxinic Black Sea.  Euxinic events in Earth's history  Presence of euxinia in the world's ancient deep oceans. According to Canfield, the deep ocean became sulfitic around 1.8 billion years ago and stayed that way for much of the boring billion. Periodic euxinia dominated through the Late Devonian Kelwasser events, and then most likely disappeared during the Carboniferous. Euxinia reemerged at the Permian-Triassic Boundary, and may have been present during the Ocean Anoxia Events of the Mesozoic. Euxinia is rare in Cenozoic oceans. Adapted from Lyons, 2008 = Proterozoic = The Proterozoic is the transition era between anoxic and oxygenated oceans. The classic model is that the end of the Banded iron formations (BIFs) was due to the injection of oxygen into the deep ocean, an approximately 0.6 billion year lag behind the Great Oxygenation Event. Canfield, however, argued that anoxia lasted much longer, and the end of the banded iron formations was due to the introduction of sulfide. Supporting Canfield's original hypothesis, 1.84 billion year old sedimentary records have been found in the Animike group in Canada that exhibit close to full pyritization on top of the last of the banded iron formations, showing evidence of a transition to euxinic conditions in that basin. In order for full pyritization to happen, nearly all of the sulfate in the water was reduced to sulfide, which stripped the iron from the water, forming pyrite. Because this basin was open to the ocean, deep euxinia was interpreted as being a widespread phenomena. This euxinia is hypothesized to have lasted until about 0.8 billion years ago, making basin bottom euxinia a potentially widespread feature throughout the Boring Billion. Further evidence for euxinia was discovered in the McArthur Basin in Australia, where similar iron chemistry was found. The degree of pyritization and the Œ¥34S were both high, supporting the presence of anoxia and sulfide, as well as the depletion of sulfate. A different study found biomarkers for green sulfur bacteria and purple sulfur bacteria in the same area, providing further evidence for the reduction of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide. Molybdenum isotopes have been used to examine the distribution of euxinia in the Proterozoic eon, and suggest that perhaps euxinia was not as widespread as Canfield initially postulated. Bottom waters may have been more widely suboxic than anoxic, and there could have been negative feedback between euxinia and the high levels of surface primary production needed to sustain euxinic conditions. Further work has suggested that from 700 million years ago (late Proterozoic) and onward, the deep oceans may have actually been anoxic and iron rich with conditions similar to those during the formation of BIFs. = Phanerozoic = There is evidence for multiple euxinic events during the Phanerozoic. It is most likely that euxinia was periodic during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, but geologic data is too sparse to draw any large scale conclusions. In this eon, there is some evidence that euxinic events are potentially linked with mass extinction events including the Late Devonian and Permian‚ÄìTriassic.  Paleozoic  The periodic presence of euxinic conditions in the Lower Cambrian has been supported by evidence found on the Yangtze platform in South China. Sulfur isotopes during the transition from Proterozoic to Phanerozoic give evidence for widespread euxinia, perhaps lasting throughout the Cambrian period.Gill, Benjamin C, Timothy W Lyons, Seth a Young, Lee R Kump, Andrew H Knoll, and Matthew R Saltzman. 2010. \\"Geochemical Evidence for Widespread Euxinia in the Later Cambrian Ocean.\\" Nature 469 (7328): 80‚Äì83. doi:10.1038/nature09700. Towards the end of the Lower Cambrian, the euxinic chemocline grew deeper until euxinia was present only in the sediments, and once sulfate became limiting, conditions became anoxic instead of euxinic. Some areas eventually became oxic, while others eventually returned to euxinic for some time. Geological records from the paleozoic in the Selwyn Basin in Northern Canada have also shown evidence for episodic stratification and mixing, where, using Œ¥34S, it was determined that hydrogen sulfide was more prevalent than sulfate. Although this was not originally attributed to euxinia, further studies found that seawater in that time likely had low concentrations of sulfate, meaning that the sulfur in the water was primarily in the form of sulfide. This combined with organic-rich black shale provide strong evidence for euxinia. There is similar evidence in the black shales in the mid-continent North America from the Devonian and early Mississippian periods. Isorenieratene, a pigment known as a proxy for an anoxic photic zone, has been found in the geological record in Illinois and Michigan. Although present, these events were probably ephemeral and did not last for longer periods of time. Similar periodic evidence of euxinia can also be found in the Sunbury shales of Kentucky. Evidence for euxinia has also been tied to the Kellwasser events of the Late Devonian Extinction event. Euxinia in basinal waters in what is now central Europe (Germany, Poland, and France) persisted for part of the late Devonian, and may have spread up into shallow waters, contributing to the extinction event. There was perhaps a period of oxygenation of bottom waters during the Carboniferous, most likely between the Late Devonian Extinction and the Permian-Triassic Extinction, at which point euxinia would be very rare in the paleo oceans. The Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event may also have some ties to euxinia, with hypercapnia and hydrogen sulfide toxicity killing off many species. Presence of a biomarker for anaerobic photosynthesis by green sulfur bacteria has been found spanning from the Permian to early Triassic in sedimentary rock in both Australia and China, meaning that euxinic conditions extended up quite shallow in the water column, contributing to the extinctions and perhaps even slowed the recovery. It is uncertain, however, just how widespread photic zone euxinia was during this period. Modelers have hypothesized that due to environmental conditions anoxia and sulfide may have been brought up from a deep, vast euxinic reservoir in upwelling areas, but stable, gyre-like areas remained oxic.  Mesozoic  The Mesozoic is well known for its distinct Ocean Anoxic Events (OAEs) which resulted in the burial of layers of black shale. Although these OAEs are not stand alone evidence for euxinia, many do contain biomarkers which support euxinic formation. Again, evidence is not universal. OAEs may have spurred the spread of existing euxinia, especially in upwelling regions or semi-restricted basins, but photic zone euxinia did not happen everywhere.  Cenozoic  Few episodes of euxinia are evident in the sedimentary record during the Cenozoic. Since the end of the Cretaceous OAEs, it is most likely that the oceanic bottom waters have stayed oxic.  Modern euxinia  Euxinic conditions have nearly vanished from Earth's open-ocean environments, but a few small scale examples still exist today. Many of these locations share common biogeochemical characteristics. For example, low rates of overturning and vertical mixing of the total water column is common in euxinic bodies of water. Small surface area to depth ratios allow multiple stable layers to form while limiting wind- driven overturning and thermohaline circulation. Furthermore, restricted mixing enhances stratified layers of high nutrient density which are reinforced by biological recycling. Within the chemocline, highly specialized organisms, such as green sulfur bacteria take advantage of the strong redox potential gradient and minimal sunlight. = The Black Sea = Map of the Black Sea showing the many rivers that supply the basin with low-density fresh water, along with the narrow Bosphorus Strait to the southwest that supplies the basin with high-density salt water. This assists in the stratification and euxinia that exists in the modern Black Sea. The Black Sea is a commonly used modern model for understanding biogeochemical processes that occur under euxinic conditions. It is thought to represent the conditions of Earth's proto-oceans and thus assists in the interpretation of oceanic proxies. Black Sea sediment contains redox reactions to depths of tens of meters, compared to single centimeters in the open ocean. This unique feature is important for understanding the behavior of the redox cascade under euxinic conditions.Stewart, Keith, et al. \\"Oxic, suboxic, and anoxic conditions in the Black Sea.\\" The Black Sea Flood Question: Changes in Coastline, Climate, and Human Settlement. Springer Netherlands, 2007. 1-21. The only connection between the open ocean and the Black Sea is the Bosphorus Strait, through which dense Mediterranean waters are imported. Subsequently, numerous rivers, such as the Danube, Don, Dnieper, and Dniester, drain fresh water into the Black Sea, which floats on top of the more dense Mediterranean water, causing a strong, stratified water column. This stratification is maintained by a strong pycnocline which restricts ventilation of deep waters and results in an intermediate layer called the chemocline, a sharp boundary separating oxic surface waters from anoxic bottom waters usually between 50m and 100m depth, with interannual variation attributed to large scale changes in temperature. Well-mixed, oxic conditions exist above the chemocline and sulfidic conditions are dominant below. Surface oxygen and deep water sulfide do not overlap via vertical mixing, but horizontal entrainment of oxygenated waters and vertical mixing of oxidized manganese into sulfidic waters may occur near the Bosphorus Strait inlet. Manganese and iron oxides likely oxidize hydrogen sulfide near the chemocline, resulting in the decrease in H2S concentrations as one approaches the chemocline from below. = Meromictic lakes = Meromictic lakes are poorly mixed and anoxic bodies of water with strong vertical stratification. While meromictic lakes are frequently categorized as bodies of water with the potential for euxinic conditions, many do not exhibit euxinia. Meromictic lakes are infamous for limnic eruptions. These events usually coincide with nearby tectonic or volcanic activity that disturbs the otherwise stable stratification of meromictic lakes. This can result in the release of immense concentrations of stored toxic gasses from the anoxic bottom waters, such as CO2 and H2S, especially from euxinic meromictic lakes. In high enough concentration, these limnic explosions can be deadly to humans and animals, such as the Lake Nyos disaster in 1986. Mariager fjord often produces a \\"rotten egg\\" smell in the summer due to sulfur content. = North Sea fjords = Some fjords develop euxinia if the connection to the open ocean is constricted, similar to the case of the Black Sea. This constriction prohibits relatively dense, oxygen-rich oceanic water from mixing with the bottom water of the fjord, which leads to stable stratified layers in the fjord. Low salinity melt water forms a lens of fresh, low density water on top of a more dense mass of bottom water. Ground sources of sulfur are also an important cause for euxinia in fjords.  Framvaren Fjord  This fjord was born as a glacial lake that was separated from the open ocean (the North Sea) when it was lifted during glacial rebound. A shallow channel (2m deep) was dug in 1850, providing a marginal connection to the North Sea. A strong pycnocline separates fresh surface water from dense, saline bottom water, and this pycnolcine reduces mixing between the layers. Anoxic conditions persist below the chemocline at 20m, and the fjord has the highest levels of hydrogen sulfide in the anoxic marine world. Like the Black Sea, vertical overlap of oxygen and sulfur is limited, but the decline of H2S approaching the chemocline from below is indicative of oxidation of H2S, which has been attributed to manganese and iron oxides, photo-autotrophic bacteria, and entrainment of oxygen horizontally from the boundaries of the fjord. These oxidation processes are similar to those present in the Black Sea. Two strong seawater intrusion events have occurred through the channel in recent history (1902 and 1942). Seawater intrusions to fjords force dense, salty, oxygen-rich water into the typically anoxic, sulfidic bottom waters of euxinic fjords. These events result in a temporary disturbance to the chemocline, raising the depth at which H2S is detected. The breakdown of the chemocline causes H2S to react with dissolved oxygen in a redox reaction. This decreases the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the biologically active photic zone which can result in basin-scale fish die-offs. The 1942 event, in particular, was strong enough to chemically reduce the vast majority of oxygen and elevate the chemocline to the air-water interface. This caused a temporary state of total anoxia in the fjord, and resulted in dramatic fish mortality.  Mariager Fjord  This fjord is marked by a highly mobile chemocline with a depth that is thought to be related to temperature effects. Local reports of strong rotten egg smell- the smell of sulfur- during numerous summers around the fjord provide evidence that, like the Framvaren fjord, the chemocline has breached the surface of the fjord at least five times in the last century. Sediments export during these events increased the concentrations of dissolved phosphates, inorganic bioavailable nitrogen, and other nutrients, resulting in a harmful algal bloom. = Cariaco Basin = The Cariaco Basin in Venezuela has been used to study the cycle of organic material in euxinic marine environments. An increase in productivity coincident with post glacial nutrient loading probably caused a transition from oxic to anoxic and subsequently euxinic conditions around 14.5 thousand years ago. High productivity at the surface produces a rain of particulate organic matter to the sub surface where anoxic, sulfidic conditions persist. The organic matter in this region is oxidized with sulfate, producing reduced sulfur (H2S) as a waste product. Free sulfur exists deep in the water column and up to 6m in depth in the sediment.

History =Background= White immigrants flooded into northern California in 1848 due to the California Gold Rush, increasing the non-Indian population of California from 13,000 to well over 300,000 in little more than a decade. The sudden influx of miners and settlers on top of the nearly 300,000 Native Americans living in the area strained space and resources. In 1851, the civilian governor of California declared, \\"That a war of extermination will continue to be waged, until the Indian race becomes extinct, must be expected.\\" This expectation soon found its way into law. An 1851 legislative measure not only gave settlers the right to organize lynch mobs to kill Indians, but allowed them to submit their expenses to the government. By 1852 the state had authorized over a million dollars in such claims. =Incident= On May 15, 1854, six Missouri-based explorers led by Pierce Asbill happened upon Round Valley while searching for a route between Weaverville, an interior mining center, and Petaluma, an important river port. Round Valley was in an isolated, difficult to access region of the Coast Range, allowing it to remain relatively untouched by settlers and miners to this point. While crossing a meadow, the explorers spotted movement in the grass and realized that Indians were in the valley. Asbill stated, \\"We've come a long way from Missouri to locate this place... an' be damned if wigglin' grass 'ull keep us away! Git a‚Äìhold of yer weapons‚Äîwe'uns are goin' in!\\" The party proceeded to a creek bed where they encountered a large settlement of Yuki. Through the combination of superior weaponry, horses, and focused intent, the party killed approximately 40 of the people. =Repercussions= Neither Asbill nor any of his fellow settlers were charged with any malfeasance for killing the nonthreatening Indians. Asbill stayed on to hunt the land and eventually began kidnapping and trafficking Yuki women to be sold to non-Indian men outside of the valley. Asbill sold 35 women in this manner by 1855. Aftermath Due to Round Valley's remote location, it became a destination for other Indians the settlers had forced off their lands, and soon its native population swelled to 20,000, while the White settlers in the area remained a few dozen. With their concentrated and vulnerable position (along with the 1850 California law \\"Act for the Government and Protection of Indians,\\" which legalized the kidnapping and forced servitude of Indians by White settlers), slave raids against the Round Valley Indians became common. Further conflict soon led to terrorist attacks meant to drive the Indians from the valley (see Round Valley Settler Massacres of 1856 - 1859 and Mendocino War). By 1860 all remaining Yuki Indians had been forced into reservations. In the 1880s, settlers began taking over the reservation lands which instigated another \\"war\\" (see Round Valley War), resulting in the further loss of land and lives by the Yuki Indians.

It is situated in Mithi Taluka, Tharparkar District, approximately 64 km in the south of Mirpur Khas town, Sindh. Its location gave it its other common name, \\"The Gateway to the Thar Desert\\". It is meant to guard the area against the Rajputs. The fort is unique in the area as bricks were only used for its construction and did not use materials such as wood and iron. The fort is developed of burnt bricks in mud mortar which is 113 meters in length and 98 meters in breadth. On the southern side of the castle, another four-sided construction which measures 15 meter √ó 13 meter has it the merely entrance and narrow approach to the internal placement of fort. The entire walls and bastion reflects attenuating look. The thin narrow entrance is accessed via a twisted passage established by 2 heavy and semi circled bastions. The bastion is near to the gateway, and making a section of the 4-sided squarish establishment, is over 9.5 cm tall with a base of having a diameter about 42 meters. The altitude of arched entrance is 7 meters and breadth is 4 meters. The access to the internal section of the fort is via causeway kind room and hall, which is the part of 4-sided construction, itself a castle. The fort is composed of 9 semi circled bastions, while the 2 of them are protecting the primary entrance, four at the edges and one each at the center of the southern, northern and western walls. A four-meter-wide wall extends on the four sides of the castle. It owns two burnt-brick stairs to climb the wall upwards, from the internal side of the castle. The internal portion of the fort consists of the remnants of rooms etc. which might go to recommend that these were the residential luxurious quarters. A minor construction like a prison or dungeon could have been the room of barood khana, or the area to secure ammunition. Talpurs belongs to the Balochi tribe who later settled in Sindh. The Talpurs dynasty encamped in northern Sindh, spoke the Sindhi language very fluently. Soon their successors and associates established a federation against the dynasty of Kalhora. Although, they enjoy good relation with Kalhoras later then and were offered by them to help arrange the scattered Balochi tribes surviving in Sindh. Talpurs are generally known to be as the founder of Sindh‚Äôs Unity. The ruling era of Talpurs in Sindh was from 1783 to 1843. Later, it was captured by the British East India Company commanded by General Charles James Napier. The building is currently undergoing restorations since its drainage might be blocked, leading to water accumulating within the location.

It is a ground orchid with a single, hairy leaf and usually only one yellowish-green and red flower. Description Caladenia reticulata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single hairy leaf, long, wide. A single yellowish-green and red to wholly red flower is borne on a spike tall. The sepals have dark, narrow, club-like glandular tips long. The dorsal sepal is erect at its base but curves forward and is long. The lateral sepals are long and wide and spreading. The petals are slightly shorter and narrower than the lateral sepals and taper to narrow, thread-like tips. The labellum is red or yellowish-green with red markings and is long and wide. The sides of the labellum sometimes have teeth up to long and there are four or six rows of calli which are long near the base of the labellum but decreasing in size towards its tip. Flowering occurs from September to November. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia reticulata was first formally described in 1882 by Robert D. FitzGerald and the description was published in The Gardeners' Chronicle. The specific epithet (reticulata) is a Latin word meaning \\"netted\\" or \\"net-like\\". Distribution and habitat The veined spider orchid is widespread but localised in Victoria near Stawell, Ararat, Horsham and Dunolly where it usually grows in open woodland. In South Australia it occurs in the Southern Lofty and Kangaroo Island bioregions, growing on forested slopes. Conservation Caladenia reticulata is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" in Victoria.

Middle Kingdom (ca. 2055 ‚Äì 1650) The Middle Kingdom was a period of reunification after Mentuhotep II‚Äôs defeat of the rival 10th Dynasty of Herakleopolis that would last for about 400 years.[4] While the Old Kingdom could be defined by their large tombs and pyramids the Middle Kingdom holds no such trait and was more of a time of change.[5] The Middle Kingdom was a time of strong kings and military expansion into lower Nubia led by 12th Dynasty kings Senusret I and Senusret III.[6] The Middle Kingdom was a period of powerful kings and military might. Going in to the 13th dynasty there were many kings and the throne was passed along from ruler to ruler, but this ‚Äúimage of chaos is contradicted, however, by the contemporary documentation on court officials.[7]‚Äù The Middle Kingdom was by many accounts a stable period of powerful kings up until the 13th Dynasty that would eventually transition in to the Second Intermediate Period. Middle Kingdom literature One thing that the Middle Kingdom is known for was in the cultural realm, and the works of literature during this time would later be referred to as classics by Ancient Egyptians.[8] Literature had a strong impact and ‚Äúmany of the works known today were composed in the Middle Kingdom, and later Egyptians saw several of them as classics.[9]‚Äù The writings in the Old Kingdom was somewhat limited, but that changed in the Middle Kingdom when different genres were able to develop.[10] The Middle Kingdom was a period of creativity that was not possible earlier in Egyptian history. Interpretation The Complaints of Khakheperraseneb has been regarded as purely a literary composition. Since the writing was likely during the reigns of Senwosret III or Amenemhet III it is seen as literature because evidence points to these reigns being prosperous.[11] Miriam Lichtheim believes that the Complaints are nothing more than literature although she does leave the door open for possible political criticism.[12] When Gardiner interpreted the work he also saw it as nothing more than a literary composition and ‚Äúfor him the work is no great achievement.[13]‚Äù Evidence showed that Egypt was largely in a prosperous state at the likely time of the writing. Other scholars feel that the writing holds a stronger and more significant message. Jan Assmann for example believes that this piece from Khakheperraseneb is an expression of a problem only authors feel, and that problem is the pressure to create something new.[14] Khakheperraseneb sees the ‚Äúlack of originality among the contemporaries‚Äù of his time and he is very much aware of the repetitiveness of his time and he wants something new to say.[15] Assman continues on by saying that ‚Äúthe bard embodies and performs a tradition, an author changes it by adding to it.[16]‚Äù Fragmented Work? Without any new evidence, it cannot be said for certain, but given the fact that the work that we have is only 20 lines suggests that the writing board is a fraction of the original work.[17] It would be hard to believe that ‚ÄúKhakheperraseneb‚Äôs reputation should have rested on so slender a foundation.[18]‚Äù Further evidence is the fact that Khakheperraseneb ‚Äúis included in the list of sages preserved in Papyrus Chester Beatty IV, and in a similar list inscribed on a tomb wall at Saqqara.[19]‚Äù A writer who is revered would either have had more well-known compositions or his complaints were originally a larger piece and astounded future Egyptians looking back on his work.

It was founded in January 2011 by former Chief Ombudsman, Public Service Commission chairman and Police Commissioner Ila Geno on an anti-corruption platform. He was supported by anti-corruption advocates John Toguata and Daniel Kassa and former National Court judge Nemo Yalo, while Tobias Thomas served as party secretary. It won its first seat in August 2011, when accountant Tobias Kulang, an in-law of Geno, won a by- election in the seat of Kundiawa-Gembogl caused by the death of Joe Mek Teine. Kulang was re-elected at the 2012 election, but the party won no other seats. After the election, Kulang as party leader attacked O'Neill for being involved with people who he claimed had been involved in alleged fraud, and vowed to join the opposition to provide public scrutiny of the government's performance. Kulang continued as an outspoken individual member of the opposition after his re-election, although very little was heard of the party itself thereafter. In October 2013, Geno and Kulang jointly filed a constitutional challenge against a law extending the parliamentary grace period from no-confidence motions. However, the next month, in November 2013, Kulang resigned from the PNGCDP and crossed to the government, joining O'Neill's junior coalition partner, the People's Progress Party. After a period of inactivity, Geno reactivated the party for the 2017 election. The party was named as part of a proposed \\"alternative government\\" of opposition parties should the governing People's National Congress fail to win a majority. The party did not win any seats and is not currently registered as a political party.

It is intended as a comprehensive list of tactical approaches to Software Quality Assurance (more widely colloquially known as Quality Assurance (traditionally called by the acronym \\"QA\\") and general application of the test method (usually just called \\"testing\\" or sometimes \\"developer testing\\"). Installation testing An installation test assures that the system is installed correctly and working at actual customer's hardware.  The box approach  Software testing methods are traditionally divided into white- and black-box testing. These two approaches are used to describe the point of view that a test engineer takes when designing test cases. = White-box testing = White-box testing (also known as clear box testing, glass box testing, transparent box testing and structural testing, by seeing the source code) tests internal structures or workings of a program, as opposed to the functionality exposed to the end-user. In white-box testing an internal perspective of the system, as well as programming skills, are used to design test cases. The tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through the code and determine the appropriate outputs. This is analogous to testing nodes in a circuit, e.g. in-circuit testing (ICT). While white-box testing can be applied at the unit, integration and system levels of the software testing process, it is usually done at the unit level. It can test paths within a unit, paths between units during integration, and between subsystems during a system‚Äìlevel test. Though this method of test design can uncover many errors or problems, it might not detect unimplemented parts of the specification or missing requirements. Techniques used in white-box testing include: * API testing ‚Äì testing of the application using public and private APIs (application programming interfaces) * Code coverage ‚Äì creating tests to satisfy some criteria of code coverage (e.g., the test designer can create tests to cause all statements in the program to be executed at least once) * Fault injection methods ‚Äì intentionally introducing faults to gauge the efficacy of testing strategies * Mutation testing methods * Static testing methods Code coverage tools can evaluate the completeness of a test suite that was created with any method, including black-box testing. This allows the software team to examine parts of a system that are rarely tested and ensures that the most important function points have been tested.Introduction, Code Coverage Analysis, Steve Cornett Code coverage as a software metric can be reported as a percentage for: :* Function coverage, which reports on functions executed :* Statement coverage, which reports on the number of lines executed to complete the test :* Decision coverage, which reports on whether both the True and the False branch of a given test has been executed 100% statement coverage ensures that all code paths or branches (in terms of control flow) are executed at least once. This is helpful in ensuring correct functionality, but not sufficient since the same code may process different inputs correctly or incorrectly. = Black-box testing = Black box diagram Black-box testing treats the software as a \\"black box\\", examining functionality without any knowledge of internal implementation, without seeing the source code. The testers are only aware of what the software is supposed to do, not how it does it. Black-box testing methods include: equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, all-pairs testing, state transition tables, decision table testing, fuzz testing, model- based testing, use case testing, exploratory testing and specification-based testing. Specification-based testing aims to test the functionality of software according to the applicable requirements. This level of testing usually requires thorough test cases to be provided to the tester, who then can simply verify that for a given input, the output value (or behavior), either \\"is\\" or \\"is not\\" the same as the expected value specified in the test case. Test cases are built around specifications and requirements, i.e., what the application is supposed to do. It uses external descriptions of the software, including specifications, requirements, and designs to derive test cases. These tests can be functional or non-functional, though usually functional. Specification-based testing may be necessary to assure correct functionality, but it is insufficient to guard against complex or high-risk situations. One advantage of the black box technique is that no programming knowledge is required. Whatever biases the programmers may have had, the tester likely has a different set and may emphasize different areas of functionality. On the other hand, black-box testing has been said to be \\"like a walk in a dark labyrinth without a flashlight.\\" Because they do not examine the source code, there are situations when a tester writes many test cases to check something that could have been tested by only one test case, or leaves some parts of the program untested. This method of test can be applied to all levels of software testing: unit, integration, system and acceptance. It typically comprises most if not all testing at higher levels, but can also dominate unit testing as well. Visual testing The aim of visual testing is to provide developers with the ability to examine what was happening at the point of software failure by presenting the data in such a way that the developer can easily find the information she or he requires, and the information is expressed clearly. At the core of visual testing is the idea that showing someone a problem (or a test failure), rather than just describing it, greatly increases clarity and understanding. Visual testing therefore requires the recording of the entire test process ‚Äì capturing everything that occurs on the test system in video format. Output videos are supplemented by real-time tester input via picture-in-a-picture webcam and audio commentary from microphones. Visual testing provides a number of advantages. The quality of communication is increased drastically because testers can show the problem (and the events leading up to it) to the developer as opposed to just describing it and the need to replicate test failures will cease to exist in many cases. The developer will have all the evidence he or she requires of a test failure and can instead focus on the cause of the fault and how it should be fixed. Visual testing is particularly well-suited for environments that deploy agile methods in their development of software, since agile methods require greater communication between testers and developers and collaboration within small teams. Ad hoc testing and exploratory testing are important methodologies for checking software integrity, because they require less preparation time to implement, while the important bugs can be found quickly. In ad hoc testing, where testing takes place in an improvised, impromptu way, the ability of a test tool to visually record everything that occurs on a system becomes very important in order to document the steps taken to uncover the bug. Visual testing is gathering recognition in customer acceptance and usability testing, because the test can be used by many individuals involved in the development process. For the customer, it becomes easy to provide detailed bug reports and feedback, and for program users, visual testing can record user actions on screen, as well as their voice and image, to provide a complete picture at the time of software failure for the developers. = Grey-box testing = Grey-box testing (American spelling: gray-box testing) involves having knowledge of internal data structures and algorithms for purposes of designing tests, while executing those tests at the user, or black-box level. The tester is not required to have full access to the software's source code. Manipulating input data and formatting output do not qualify as grey-box, because the input and output are clearly outside of the \\"black box\\" that we are calling the system under test. This distinction is particularly important when conducting integration testing between two modules of code written by two different developers, where only the interfaces are exposed for test. However, tests that require modifying a back-end data repository such as a database or a log file does qualify as grey-box, as the user would not normally be able to change the data repository in normal production operations. Grey-box testing may also include reverse engineering to determine, for instance, boundary values or error messages. By knowing the underlying concepts of how the software works, the tester makes better-informed testing choices while testing the software from outside. Typically, a grey-box tester will be permitted to set up an isolated testing environment with activities such as seeding a database. The tester can observe the state of the product being tested after performing certain actions such as executing SQL statements against the database and then executing queries to ensure that the expected changes have been reflected. Grey-box testing implements intelligent test scenarios, based on limited information. This will particularly apply to data type handling, exception handling, and so on.  Automated testing  Many programming groups are relying more and more on automated testing, especially groups that use test-driven development. There are many frameworks to write tests in, and continuous integration software will run tests automatically every time code is checked into a version control system. While automation cannot reproduce everything that a human can do (and all the ways they think of doing it), it can be very useful for regression testing. However, it does require a well- developed test suite of testing scripts in order to be truly useful. = Automated testing tools = Program testing and fault detection can be aided significantly by testing tools and debuggers. Testing/debug tools include features such as: * Program monitors, permitting full or partial monitoring of program code including: ** Instruction set simulator, permitting complete instruction level monitoring and trace facilities ** Hypervisor, permitting complete control of the execution of program code including:- ** Program animation, permitting step-by-step execution and conditional breakpoint at source level or in machine code ** Code coverage reports * Formatted dump or symbolic debugging, tools allowing inspection of program variables on error or at chosen points * Automated functional GUI(Graphical User Interface) testing tools are used to repeat system-level tests through the GUI * Benchmarks, allowing run-time performance comparisons to be made * Performance analysis (or profiling tools) that can help to highlight hot spots and resource usage Some of these features may be incorporated into a single composite tool or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). = Abstraction of application layers as applied to automated testing = There are generally four recognized levels of tests: unit testing, integration testing, component interface testing, and system testing. Tests are frequently grouped by where they are added in the software development process, or by the level of specificity of the test. The main levels during the development process as defined by the SWEBOK guide are unit-, integration-, and system testing that are distinguished by the test target without implying a specific process model. Other test levels are classified by the testing objective. There are two different levels of tests from the perspective of customers: low-level testing (LLT) and high-level testing (HLT). LLT is a group of tests for different level components of software application or product. HLT is a group of tests for the whole software application or product.  Unit testing  Unit testing refers to tests that verify the functionality of a specific section of code, usually at the function level. In an object-oriented environment, this is usually at the class level, and the minimal unit tests include the constructors and destructors. These types of tests are usually written by developers as they work on code (white-box style), to ensure that the specific function is working as expected. One function might have multiple tests, to catch corner cases or other branches in the code. Unit testing alone cannot verify the functionality of a piece of software, but rather is used to ensure that the building blocks of the software work independently from each other. Unit testing is a software development process that involves synchronized application of a broad spectrum of defect prevention and detection strategies in order to reduce software development risks, time, and costs. It is performed by the software developer or engineer during the construction phase of the software development lifecycle. Rather than replace traditional QA focuses, it augments it. Unit testing aims to eliminate construction errors before code is promoted to QA; this strategy is intended to increase the quality of the resulting software as well as the efficiency of the overall development and QA process. Depending on the organization's expectations for software development, unit testing might include static code analysis, data- flow analysis, metrics analysis, peer code reviews, code coverage analysis and other software verification practices.  Integration testing  Integration testing is any type of software testing that seeks to verify the interfaces between components against a software design. Software components may be integrated in an iterative way or all together (\\"big bang\\"). Normally the former is considered a better practice since it allows interface issues to be located more quickly and fixed. Integration testing works to expose defects in the interfaces and interaction between integrated components (modules). Progressively larger groups of tested software components corresponding to elements of the architectural design are integrated and tested until the software works as a system.  Component interface testing  The practice of component interface testing can be used to check the handling of data passed between various units, or subsystem components, beyond full integration testing between those units. The data being passed can be considered as \\"message packets\\" and the range or data types can be checked, for data generated from one unit, and tested for validity before being passed into another unit. One option for interface testing is to keep a separate log file of data items being passed, often with a timestamp logged to allow analysis of thousands of cases of data passed between units for days or weeks. Tests can include checking the handling of some extreme data values while other interface variables are passed as normal values. Unusual data values in an interface can help explain unexpected performance in the next unit. Component interface testing is a variation of black-box testing, with the focus on the data values beyond just the related actions of a subsystem component.  System testing  System testing tests a completely integrated system to verify that the system meets its requirements. For example, a system test might involve testing a logon interface, then creating and editing an entry, plus sending or printing results, followed by summary processing or deletion (or archiving) of entries, then logoff.  Operational acceptance testing  Operational acceptance is used to conduct operational readiness (pre- release) of a product, service or system as part of a quality management system. OAT is a common type of non-functional software testing, used mainly in software development and software maintenance projects. This type of testing focuses on the operational readiness of the system to be supported, and/or to become part of the production environment. Hence, it is also known as operational readiness testing (ORT) or Operations readiness and assurance (OR&A;) testing. Functional testing within OAT is limited to those tests which are required to verify the non-functional aspects of the system. In addition, the software testing should ensure that the portability of the system, as well as working as expected, does not also damage or partially corrupt its operating environment or cause other processes within that environment to become inoperative.Whitepaper: Operational Acceptance ‚Äì an application of the ISO 29119 Software Testing standard. May 2015 Anthony Woods, Capgemini Compatibility testing A common cause of software failure (real or perceived) is a lack of its compatibility with other application software, operating systems (or operating system versions, old or new), or target environments that differ greatly from the original (such as a terminal or GUI application intended to be run on the desktop now being required to become a web application, which must render in a web browser). For example, in the case of a lack of backward compatibility, this can occur because the programmers develop and test software only on the latest version of the target environment, which not all users may be running. This results in the unintended consequence that the latest work may not function on earlier versions of the target environment, or on older hardware that earlier versions of the target environment was capable of using. Sometimes such issues can be fixed by proactively abstracting operating system functionality into a separate program module or library. Smoke and sanity testing Sanity testing determines whether it is reasonable to proceed with further testing. Smoke testing consists of minimal attempts to operate the software, designed to determine whether there are any basic problems that will prevent it from working at all. Such tests can be used as build verification test.  Regression testing  Regression testing focuses on finding defects after a major code change has occurred. Specifically, it seeks to uncover software regressions, as degraded or lost features, including old bugs that have come back. Such regressions occur whenever software functionality that was previously working correctly, stops working as intended. Typically, regressions occur as an unintended consequence of program changes, when the newly developed part of the software collides with the previously existing code. Common methods of regression testing include re-running previous sets of test cases and checking whether previously fixed faults have re-emerged. The depth of testing depends on the phase in the release process and the risk of the added features. They can either be complete, for changes added late in the release or deemed to be risky, or be very shallow, consisting of positive tests on each feature, if the changes are early in the release or deemed to be of low risk. Regression testing is typically the largest test effort in commercial software development, Paul Ammann; Jeff Offutt (2008). [https://books.google.com/books?id=leokXF8pLY0C&pg;=PA215 Introduction to Software Testing]. p. 215 of 322 pages. due to checking numerous details in prior software features, and even new software can be developed while using some old test cases to test parts of the new design to ensure prior functionality is still supported.  Acceptance testing  Acceptance testing can mean one of two things: # A smoke test is used as an acceptance test prior to introducing a new build to the main testing process, i.e., before integration or regression. # Acceptance testing performed by the customer, often in their lab environment on their own hardware, is known as user acceptance testing (UAT). Acceptance testing may be performed as part of the hand-off process between any two phases of development.  Alpha testing  Alpha testing is simulated or actual operational testing by potential users/customers or an independent test team at the developers' site. Alpha testing is often employed for off-the-shelf software as a form of internal acceptance testing, before the software goes to beta testing.  Beta testing  Beta testing comes after alpha testing and can be considered a form of external user acceptance testing. Versions of the software, known as beta versions, are released to a limited audience outside of the programming team known as beta testers. The software is released to groups of people so that further testing can ensure the product has few faults or bugs. Beta versions can be made available to the open public to increase the feedback field to a maximal number of future users and to deliver value earlier, for an extended or even indefinite period of time (perpetual beta). Functional vs non- functional testing Functional testing refers to activities that verify a specific action or function of the code. These are usually found in the code requirements documentation, although some development methodologies work from use cases or user stories. Functional tests tend to answer the question of \\"can the user do this\\" or \\"does this particular feature work.\\" Non-functional testing refers to aspects of the software that may not be related to a specific function or user action, such as scalability or other performance, behavior under certain constraints, or security. Testing will determine the breaking point, the point at which extremes of scalability or performance leads to unstable execution. Non-functional requirements tend to be those that reflect the quality of the product, particularly in the context of the suitability perspective of its users. Continuous testing Continuous testing is the process of executing automated tests as part of the software delivery pipeline to obtain immediate feedback on the business risks associated with a software release candidate.Part of the Pipeline: Why Continuous Testing Is Essential, by Adam Auerbach, TechWell Insights August 2015The Relationship between Risk and Continuous Testing: An Interview with Wayne Ariola, by Cameron Philipp-Edmonds, Stickyminds December 2015 Continuous testing includes the validation of both functional requirements and non- functional requirements; the scope of testing extends from validating bottom- up requirements or user stories to assessing the system requirements associated with overarching business goals.DevOps: Are You Pushing Bugs to Clients Faster, by Wayne Ariola and Cynthia Dunlop, PNSQC October 2015DevOps and QA: What‚Äôs the real cost of quality?, by Ericka Chickowski, DevOps.com June 2015Shift Left and Put Quality First, by Adam Auerbach, TechWell Insights October 2014  Destructive testing  Destructive testing attempts to cause the software or a sub-system to fail. It verifies that the software functions properly even when it receives invalid or unexpected inputs, thereby establishing the robustness of input validation and error-management routines. Software fault injection, in the form of fuzzing, is an example of failure testing. Various commercial non-functional testing tools are linked from the software fault injection page; there are also numerous open-source and free software tools available that perform destructive testing. Software performance testing Performance testing is generally executed to determine how a system or sub-system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a particular workload. It can also serve to investigate, measure, validate or verify other quality attributes of the system, such as scalability, reliability and resource usage. Load testing is primarily concerned with testing that the system can continue to operate under a specific load, whether that be large quantities of data or a large number of users. This is generally referred to as software scalability. The related load testing activity of when performed as a non-functional activity is often referred to as endurance testing. Volume testing is a way to test software functions even when certain components (for example a file or database) increase radically in size. Stress testing is a way to test reliability under unexpected or rare workloads. Stability testing (often referred to as load or endurance testing) checks to see if the software can continuously function well in or above an acceptable period. There is little agreement on what the specific goals of performance testing are. The terms load testing, performance testing, scalability testing, and volume testing, are often used interchangeably. Real-time software systems have strict timing constraints. To test if timing constraints are met, real-time testing is used. Usability testing Usability testing is to check if the user interface is easy to use and understand. It is concerned mainly with the use of the application. Accessibility testing Accessibility testing may include compliance with standards such as: * Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 * Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 * Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Security testing Security testing is essential for software that processes confidential data to prevent system intrusion by hackers. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines this as a \\"type of testing conducted to evaluate the degree to which a test item, and associated data and information, are protected so that unauthorised persons or systems cannot use, read or modify them, and authorized persons or systems are not denied access to them.\\"ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-1:2013 ‚Äì Software and Systems Engineering ‚Äì Software Testing ‚Äì Part 1 ‚Äì Concepts and Definitions; Section 4.38 Internationalization and localization testing  The general ability of software to be internationalized and localized can be automatically tested without actual translation, by using pseudolocalization. It will verify that the application still works, even after it has been translated into a new language or adapted for a new culture (such as different currencies or time zones). Actual translation to human languages must be tested, too. Possible localization failures include: * Software is often localized by translating a list of strings out of context, and the translator may choose the wrong translation for an ambiguous source string. * Technical terminology may become inconsistent if the project is translated by several people without proper coordination or if the translator is imprudent. * Literal word-for-word translations may sound inappropriate, artificial or too technical in the target language. * Untranslated messages in the original language may be left hard coded in the source code. * Some messages may be created automatically at run time and the resulting string may be ungrammatical, functionally incorrect, misleading or confusing. * Software may use a keyboard shortcut which has no function on the source language's keyboard layout, but is used for typing characters in the layout of the target language. * Software may lack support for the character encoding of the target language. * Fonts and font sizes which are appropriate in the source language may be inappropriate in the target language; for example, CJK characters may become unreadable if the font is too small. * A string in the target language may be longer than the software can handle. This may make the string partly invisible to the user or cause the software to crash or malfunction. * Software may lack proper support for reading or writing bi-directional text. * Software may display images with text that was not localized. * Localized operating systems may have differently named system configuration files and environment variables and different formats for date and currency. Development testing \\"Development testing\\" is a software development process that involves synchronized application of a broad spectrum of defect prevention and detection strategies in order to reduce software development risks, time, and costs. It is performed by the software developer or engineer during the construction phase of the software development lifecycle. Rather than replace traditional QA focuses, it augments it. Development Testing aims to eliminate construction errors before code is promoted to QA; this strategy is intended to increase the quality of the resulting software as well as the efficiency of the overall development and QA process. Depending on the organization's expectations for software development, Development Testing might include static code analysis, data flow analysis, metrics analysis, peer code reviews, unit testing, code coverage analysis, traceability, and other software verification practices. A/B testing A/B testing is basically a comparison of two outputs, generally when only one variable has changed: run a test, change one thing, run the test again, compare the results. This is more useful with more small-scale situations, but very useful in fine-tuning any program. With more complex projects, multivariant testing can be done. Concurrent testing In concurrent testing, the focus is on the performance while continuously running with normal input and under normal operational conditions, as opposed to stress testing, or fuzz testing. Memory leaks, as well as basic faults are easier to find with this method. Conformance testing or type testing In software testing, conformance testing verifies that a product performs according to its specified standards. Compilers, for instance, are extensively tested to determine whether they meet the recognized standard for that language.

She is the founder and chair of the Women of the Don NGO, which was set up in 1993. In 2016 Valentina's long service to these causes was recognised by two international awards. One was a special prize announced in October 2016, to be given concurrently with the annual Anna Politkovskaya Award.Valentina Cherevatenko, \\"A letter to Anna: what I didn't get to say\\", Rights in Russia, 27 March 2017. (The main 2016 prize-winner was Jineth Bedoya Lima; she and Valentina received their prizes in London on 11 March 2017.)See RAW in WAR website. The other award is a new prize jointly created by the French and German governments. It was awarded for the first time in December 2016 in Berlin to 15 men and women from all over the world.\\"We respect people who defend others\\", Novaya gazeta, 3 December 2016 (in Russian). Cherevatenko was given these prizes in recognition of past achievement and as a response to present harassment. The Russian government has shown its displeasure with her recent activities and those of the Women of the Don by bringing criminal charges against Valentina Cherevatenko under the 2012 Foreign Agent law. If convicted she faces a heavy fine or two years' deprivation of liberty. In late July 2017, the charges against Cherevatenko were dropped.\\"Charges Dropped Against Activist for 'Non-Compliance' With Foreign Agents Law\\", Moscow Times, 25 July 2017. Early life Valentina grew up in Novocherkassk in the Rostov Region and as a child witnessed part of the 1962 events in the city (see Novocherkassk massacre). Later in life she learned that her mother, then 23, had saved the life of a policeman during those confused and tragic days.\\"They haven't broken us yet\\", Cherevatenko interview with BBC Russian Service, 10 March 2017 (translation, Rights in Russia). Her father was Ukrainian; the city of Novocherkassk has many historical ties with Ukraine, as do its present inhabitants (pop. 170,233 in 2016). First intervention in an armed conflict, 1990 Valentina's first intervention in an armed conflict came when the USSR was still in existence. Late in 1990 the army recruitment offices in Novocherkassk called up the city's middle-aged reservists, put them on airplanes and sent them to Baku, the capital of Soviet Azerbaijan. This was not the local six-monthly training camps that such men usually attended and rumours of the continuing unrest and violence in Azerbaijan alarmed people whose husbands and fathers had now been sent there (see Baku pogrom). The director of the factory where Valentina was working gave her and her team access to his telex and they sent urgent messages to Gorbachev, Yeltsin and other decision-makers in the Soviet and RSFSR governments. As a result, the men returned home. They had not advanced beyond the airport in Baku or engaged in combat, but some had already been killed by stray bullets.Account given by Valentina Cherevatenko on 9 March 2017 at a gathering in Pushkin House, Bloomsbury. Creation of Women of the Don, 1993 \\"The Union of Women of the Don is unique,\\" wrote an OpenDemocracy profile of the organisation and its leader Valentina Cherevatenko in 2016. Set up in 1993 to help local women left unemployed in the wake of the Soviet collapse, over the past 23 years it had turned into \\"one of Russia‚Äôs largest human and civil rights NGOs\\".\\"I am convinced that the war {in eastern Ukraine} will affect us all\\" (Valentina Cherevatenko), Open Democracy website, 17 November 2016. Visit to Chechnya, 1995 Harassment by Russian authorities, 2012 onwards In 2012, after Putin's re-election as President of Russia for a third term, a law was passed that required NGOs receiving funding from abroad and engaging in \\"political activities\\" to register as Foreign Agents (see Russian foreign agent law). Like many other long-standing non- commercial organisations, the Women of the Don refused to adopt this denigrating term or voluntarily add themselves to the Register organised by the Ministry of Justice. Pressure was then brought to bear and Cherevatenko and her colleagues decided to divide the Women of the Don into two distinct organisations, one dealing with matters at the local level (the Union of the Women of the Don, operating in the Rostov Region), and the other operating in Russia and abroad (the \\"Women of the Don\\" Foundation for Civil Society and Human Rights).Civil Society under Attack: the Right to Freedom of Association in Russia, January 2015 to September 2016 (October 2016), see \\"A contested definition\\" in Legislative Developments. The report may be found on the Rights in Russia website. The Union of the Women of the Don was, nevertheless, declared a Foreign Agent in 2014. Two years later that designation was withdrawn, though it still applied to the companion Women of the Don Foundation. In June 2016 charges were brought against Valentina Cherevatenko herself (see below). Contacts with Nadia Savchenko, 2015-2016 In her role as a member of the Public Oversight Agency for places of confinement run by the Federal Penitentiary Service in the Rostov Region Valentina paid regular visits to the jailed Ukrainian airforce pilot Nadia Savchenko after she was moved to the Novocherkassk pre-trial detention centre in July 2015.\\"Where have they moved Nadia Savchenko?\\" Broadcast on TSN news service (in Ukrainian). Savchenko was held there before and after her conviction at the trial in Rostov in March 2016. During this period Cherevatenko kept the media informed about Savchenko's health‚Äîshe was then refusing to eat or drink‚Äîand Valentina's reports were published in a variety of outlets, before and after the trial when Savchenko was due for transfer to a penal colony.\\"Savchenko is in a critical condition\\", Bagnet website, 17 April 2016 (in Russian). As a consequence of this behaviour Cherevatenko lost her position with the Oversight Agency. People's diplomacy and the Minsk Accords On 24 July 2015 Valentina and the Women of the Don suggested, in an address to the Presidential Council on Civil Society and Human Rights, that people's diplomacy should also become part of the Minsk Agreements, establishing terms for ending armed conflict in eastern Ukraine and ensuring respect for the agreements on all sides.\\"A 'civilian Minsk' - The Women of the Don call for the involvement of civil society in the implementation of the Minsk Accords\\", 24 July 2015, website of The Russian Federation Presidential Council on Human Rights and Civil Society.. Cherevatenko said that such preliminary meetings had already taken place between women from Ukraine and Russia, involving journalists, members of NGOs and action groups; specialists‚Äîsuch as psychologists, doctors and others‚Äîwere also ready to help individuals, and support the process of dialogue. \\"A great many initiatives are already being implemented,\\" she said: \\"to overcome the breakdown in [formerly] close relations, to withstand propaganda and aid the formation of a critical approach, and to help those suffering from the effects of post-traumatic stress\\". Charges against Cherevatenko, 2016-2017 In late June 2016 Valentina Cherevatenko was the first individual against whom a criminal investigation was formally opened under the 2012 law on \\"foreign agent\\" NGOs.\\"First criminal case against a Foreign Agent\\", Novaya gazeta, No 72, 6 July 2016 (in Russian). She was accused of \\"malicious evasion‚Äù of the duties imposed on ‚ÄúNGOs that perform the functions of a foreign agent\\", and if convicted could pay a heavy fine or be given a two-year sentence in a penal colony. This attack on a prominent, veteran rights defender aroused concern in Russia and abroad.\\"Prominent rights defender declared a suspect under foreign agents law\\", Amnesty International, 1 July 2016. On 2 June 2017 Cherevatenko was formally charged with the above-mentioned offence, and now awaits a date for a court hearing of her case.\\"Reactions after Cherevatenko is charged\\", Rights in Russia, 12 June 2017.

He is most known for his work at Monticello, Montpelier, Bremo, and the University of Virginia. Early life Neilson was born around 1770 in the town of Ballycarry, County Antrim, Ireland near Belfast. In the 1790s, Neilson worked as an apprentice to a Belfast architect. At the time, Neilson was also part of a brewing rebellion against the British; and as a result, he was captured along with two of his brothers during the Irish Rebellion of 1798. One of these brothers, William, only fifteen years old, was hanged. John Neilson and his brother Sam were banished and sent on exile ships to the West Indies. John Neilson ended up in Philadelphia, where he became a naturalized citizen on September 28, 1804. Career Sometime in 1804 Neilson would meet Thomas Jefferson, who was then the third President of the United States. From that point until 1808 Neilson would live and work as a joiner at Monticello, Jefferson's home in Albemarle County, Virginia. It was at Monticello that Neilson began his long collaboration with fellow master joiner James Dinsmore, who was also an Irishman from Ulster. Then from 1809-10, Neilson worked on the expansion of Montpelier, the home of the fourth President of the United States, James Madison, located in Orange County, Virginia. From 1817 to 1820, Neilson worked at Bremo, the Fluvanna County, Virginia plantation of John Hartwell Cocke. Neilson's most important work took place at this estate because it was Neilson who helped design Upper Bremo by interpreting all the ideas and sketches of Cocke. Indeed, it was Neilson who gave this Palladian masterpiece its final appearance. Bremo has been described by Fiske Kimball as the most nearly perfect \\"of all the houses in the Jeffersonian tradition.\\" Neilson later went on to assist in the construction of the University of Virginia. He worked on Pavilions IX and X, seven dormitories, the Rotunda, and the Anatomical Theater. Death Neilson died June 24, 1827 at his estate in Keene, Virginia, near Charlottesville. He was buried in an unmarked grave in Charlottesville's Maplewood Cemetery. Neilson's estate included a number of his own drawings and paintings: a \\"book of drawings of the U.Va. by Jno. Neilson,\\" a \\"book of drawings of Ionic, Doric and Corinthian Orders by John Neilson,\\" a \\"book of observations of the orders of architecture and intended to accompany this book of drawings of the orders,\\" \\"3 books of drawings with drawings on oil paper,\\" \\"a book of drawings and designs,\\" and drawings of the Rotunda and two Pavilions.

Starting in 1959, the founders established themselves in Reims where they purchased cellars of a Champagne House. In 1997 the company bought another large cellar which gives them two large sites near one another. Palmer & Co holds over 200 hectares (494 acres) classified as Grand and Premier Crus in the Montagne de Reims area. Grapes from the C√¥te de S√©zanne, C√¥te des Bars and Vall√©e de la Marne complete their blends, all contributing their specific characteristics. Beginning October 2015, Palmer and Co champagne was sold in the United States according to Forbes magazine. As of May 2018, they formed an exclusive partnership with Constellation Brands, who will serve as their exclusive importer for the United States.  Time is an accomplice  The Palmer & Co quality strives for the integrity of the grapes and the wines at all stages of the winemaking process. They age their wine longer than the law requires and for a longer time than most competitors.

It has a single erect, hairy leaf and one or two green, yellow and red flowers. Until 1971 It was known as a variety of the green comb spider orchid Caladenia dilatata then, until 1989 as a variety of the clubbed spider orchid, Caladenia longiclavata.labellum detail  Description  Caladenia rhomboidiformis is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf, long and about wide. One or two green, yellow and red flowers long, wide are borne on a stalk tall. The sepals have yellowish to brown, club-like glandular tips long. The dorsal sepal is erect, long and wide. The lateral sepals are long, wide, turn stiffly downwards and roughly parallel to each other. The petals are long, wide, spread widely and are also turned stiffly downwards. The labellum is long, wide, broadly diamond-shaped and white to yellow with a deep red tip. The sides of the labellum have greenish teeth up to long and the tip is curled under. There are four rows of deep red calli along the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from September to October.  Taxonomy and naming  This orchid was first described in 1930 by Edith Coleman who gave it the name Caladenia dilatata var. rhomboidiformis and published the description in The Victorian Naturalist. In 1971, Alex George recognised it as Caladenia longiclavata var. rhomboidiformis and in 1989 Mark Clements and Stephen Hopper raised it to species status. The specific epithet (rhomboidiformis) is derived from the Ancient Greek word ·ø•œåŒºŒ≤ŒøœÇ rhombos meaning \\"rhombus\\", the suffix oid meaning \\"likeness\\" and the Latin word forma meaning \\"shape\\" or \\"figure\\" referring to the diamond-shaped labellum of this orchid.  Distribution and habitat  The diamond spider orchid is found between Busselton and Augusta in the Jarrah Forest and Warren biogeographic regions where it grows in a variety of habitats but often in jarrah forest, or Banksia or sheoak woodland. Conservation Caladenia rhomboidiformis is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

The club fields a team in both the Men's SBL (MSBL) and Women's SBL (WSBL). The club is a division of Stirling Basketball Association (SBA), the major administrative basketball organisation in the City of Stirling. The SBA was established in 1971, and in 2012, came under the umbrella of the Churches of Christ Sport & Recreation Association (CCSRA). The Senators play their home games at Warwick Stadium. Club history =Background= The creation of Stirling Basketball Association began in the late 1960s when a group of 15‚Äì17-year-old boys from the Tuart Hill Junior Basketball Club formed a new club because there was no clear pathway for them to continue their basketball careers in the Western Australian Senior District Basketball Competition. Introduced to the sport of basketball at Tuart Hill High School, the boys dominated the state's junior competitions through the 1960s and provided the bulk of the Western Australian junior state team representatives. At that time, Tuart Hill was a feeder club for the Perth Basketball Club, the leading senior club in Western Australian basketball. Limited selection meant that many boys would be left with the prospect of not having a senior career in basketball after dominating the sport in junior ranks. Led by Alan Simmonds, a number of boys from Tuart Hill approached the state association and proposed that a new district association be formed called the Stirling Basketball Association. The Stirling proposal was based on the incorporation of the Tuart Hill Boys and Norths Girls junior basketball clubs. The proposal was accepted and Stirling Basketball Association was formed in 1971, providing a pathway for all Tuart Hill boys and Norths girls basketball players to enter the Western Australian Basketball Association senior competitions under the Stirling name. The Senators had the most successful program in the era of the District Competition, as they claimed the John Leonard Perpetual Shield four times and competed for it a further six times Nicknamed the Senators, the inaugural Stirling 'A' Grade District men's team competed for the first time in the 1972 season. While Simmonds became the first Club President and team captain, Colin James from New South Wales became the team's first head coach. In just their third season, the Senators men reached their first ever grand final, where they lost 80‚Äì67 to Swan Districts. The following year, the team again made the grand final, this time winning 69‚Äì68 over Perth to claim their maiden premiership. Between 1974 and 1987, the Senators men competed in 10 A-Grade grand finals, where they won four premierships (1975, 1978, 1981 and 1982). Furthermore, the Senators women were also a force in the District Competition, as they won the inaugural women's A-Grade premiership in 1974 before competing in grand finals in 1977, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1987 and 1988, winning five titles (1974, 1981, 1984, 1985 and 1988). 1978 proved a milestone year as the club was selected to represent Western Australia in the National Australian Club Championships. This competition was a precursor to the NBL. At the 1978 Australian Club Championships in Adelaide, the Senators were the surprise team of the championships. While expected to lose early in the qualifying rounds, the team reached the final to become the first Western Australian team to do so. There they lost to the highly-credentialed Nunawading Spectres led by Bill Palmer and Alan Black, despite leading by a point at half time. =SBL= Early years and success 1989 saw the formation of the State Basketball League (SBL) with both a men's and women's competition. Stirling, trading as the Senators, entered a team into both the MSBL and WSBL. In 1990, the men's team earned a seventh-place finish with a 13‚Äì13 record before reaching the MSBL Grand Final, while the women's team claimed the minor premiership with a first-place finish a 20‚Äì4 record, before too reaching the WSBL Grand Final. Both teams however fell short, with the men losing 114‚Äì91 to the Perth Redbacks and the women losing 70‚Äì67 to the Wanneroo Wolves. For the men, it marked their first and so far only MSBL Grand Final appearance. In 1993, the Senators women returned to the WSBL Grand Final, where they lost 68‚Äì51 to the Swan City Mustangs. In 1994, the women played in their third WSBL Grand Final, this time winning their maiden championship behind a 72‚Äì59 win over the Perry Lakes Hawks. Success eluding the club Success eluded the Senators throughout the 2000s and 2010s. Season 2007 marked a rare successful year for the club, as the women's team won their second minor premiership with a 20‚Äì2 record before reaching their fourth WSBL Grand Final. There they faced the Perry Lakes Hawks, where they were defeated 66‚Äì40. Rebrand In January 2019, the club rebranded as the Warwick Senators. In August 2019, the Senators women reached their first WSBL Grand Final since 2007, where they lost 85‚Äì56 to the Rockingham Flames. Notable club figures In July 2014, club legend and Perth Wildcats great Mike Ellis was honoured with his No. 6 jersey being retired. Ellis began playing for Stirling in 1974 at the age of 17, and was in the club's first premiership team the following year. In the early 1980s, Ellis averaged over 30 points a game for five consecutive seasons and throughout his NBL career with the Perth Wildcats, he continued to play with the Senators. After his retirement from the Wildcats, Ellis continued to play with the Senators until 1998. Since retirement, Ellis has continued to be a key figure in the life of the club, contributing on every level from coaching junior and SBL teams to playing key leadership roles. In July 2018, one of the club's all-time best players, Carmie Olowoyo, had his No. 42 jersey retired by the Senators. Olowoyo played over 260 games for the Senators, beginning his career in 1995 before ending his career in 2010.

It depicts a group of women within a mosquito net preparing for an overnight visit. Background Ukiyo-e art flourished in Japan during the Edo period from the 17th to 19th centuries, and took as its primary subjects courtesans, kabuki actors, and others associated with the \\"floating world\\" lifestyle of the pleasure districts. Alongside paintings, mass-produced woodblock prints were a major form of the genre. In the mid-18th century full-colour ' prints became common, printed using a large number of woodblocks, one for each colour. A prominent genre was ' (\\"pictures of beauties\\"), which depicted most often courtesans and geisha at leisure, and promoted the entertainments of the pleasure districts. Kitagawa Utamaro (‚Äì1806) made his name in the 1790s with his bijin ≈çkubi-e (\\"large-headed pictures of beautiful women\\") portraits, focusing on the head and upper torso, a style others had previously employed in portraits of kabuki actors. Utamaro experimented with line, colour, and printing techniques to bring out subtle differences in the features, expressions, and backdrops of subjects from a wide variety of class and background. Utamaro's individuated beauties were in sharp contrast to the stereotyped, idealized images that had been the norm. Publication The multicolour nishiki-e prints in the horizontal triptych are each ≈çban-sized, measuring about . They were published by in . On each print appears the title in a corner and the signature Utamaro hitsu (, \\"brush of Utamaro\\"). Description and analysis The scene depicts women in and outside a mosquito net. Outside in the centre stands a woman changing into nightclothes, and behind her to the right an servant folds a tomesode, a ceremonial black kimono worn by married women. The kimono bears a mon crest. From inside, a woman to the right holding an uchiwa hand fan in her hands and folded sheets of kaishi paper in her mouth lifts the net as if to get out. In the middle, another woman removes a kanzashi as she prepares to go to sleep. To the left sits a woman of apparent middle age; her eyebrows are shaved off, indicating she is married.

Anderson lived in Northern Ireland during his youth before establishing JW Anderson in 2008 and subsequently launched his fashion house in London. The brand initially focused on menswear, before moving into womenswear in 2010. From 2012 onwards, the brand and its designer have collaborated with a number of retail fashion brands, most notably Topshop and Versace with LVMH acquiring a minority stake in the brand in 2013. JW Anderson won both men's and women's brand of the year at British Fashion Council's The Fashion Awards in 2015, the first brand to pick up both awards in the same year. History Jonathan Anderson graduated from the London College of Fashion, before initially pursuing a career in acting. While working at the Studio Theatre in Washington D.C., he became interested in costume design and went on to study a degree in menswear design, graduating in 2005. He worked as visual merchandiser at Prada, working alongside the designer, Manuela Pavesi. Anderson moved to London to establish his eponymous label in 2008. JW Anderson launched a menswear line in 2008. It later introduced a womenswear line for autumn 2010. During the same year, JW Anderson received sponsorship from the British Fashion Council committee, presenting their first catwalk collection at London Fashion Week. JW Anderson secured its second sponsorship from the British Fashion Council in 2011, before winning the Emerging Talent Award in 2012. JW Anderson became more widely known in Britain after Anderson collaborated with Topshop in 2012 creating a limited edition collection of clothing and accessories. Vogue covered the brand's spring/summer collection that same year, including paisley-print daywear pyjamas, which sold out shortly after launch. During London Fashion Week in 2012, JW Anderson announced it was to host its first menswear-dedicated fashion week show. JW Anderson and Topshop collaborated again in early 2013. In June 2013, Anderson showcased his first collection for Versace. The collection was for their diffusion line, Versus, with Anderson as the line's relaunch designer. Part of JW Anderson's focus was on unisex clothes. It was also rumoured at the same time that LVMH were considering Anderson for the role of creative director at Louis Vuitton. It was announced in September 2013 that LVMH had acquired a minority stake in JW Anderson. As part of the deal, Anderson was announced as creative director of the Spanish fashion house, Loewe.

Biography  Vasyl Ponikarov was born on 26 August 1929 in the village Dolynske of Ananyiv Raion of Odessa Oblast (Ukraine). His childhood coincided with the years of the Second World War. After 7 years of schooling, he left his native village. After the end of the war Vasyl continued his studies firstly in the A.S. Makarenko Tiraspol Pedagogical College (1947‚Äì1948), lately in the Odessa Art school (1949‚Äì1958). In the Art school his pedagogues were , , L.O. Tokareva-Aleksandrovych. Leonid Ovsiiovych Muchnyk while getting acquainted with the works of Vasyl advised him: \\"You should to paint in watercolor. As I think, it's yours\\". Ponikarov was called up for military service after the first course in the Art school. He was doing his military service in Yevpatoria. The military base where Vasyl was in the service appreciated a talent of young artist by entrusting to his charge all visual agitation (leaflets, placards). His gift and high appreciation of his effort as an artist culminated in increase of a duration of military service. Vasyl Ponikarov served longer than needed ‚Äì three and one half years instead of three years. After the demobilisation Vasyl continued his studies within the walls of the same Art school in Odessa . Three years after graduation from the Art school Vasyl Ponikarov becomes a student of Moscow Polygraphic Institute (1961‚Äì1970). Over this years his pedagogues were Y.K. Burdzhelyan, B.A. Sholokhov, G.T. Goroshchenko. Entering of Vasyl into the Artists' Union of the USSR (1971) was recommended by , , A.L. Yakovlev who remarked considerable growth of mastery of the artist after graduation from the Institute. Background of Vasyl Ponikarov already consisted of art works that had been exposed in all of the USSR. From 1980 onwards Vasyl Ponikarov painted on journeys on the ocean liner \\"Fedor Shalyapin\\", where he served as a staff artist. Like so, the paintings were made, those on which the artist pictured what he saw in Italy, France, Spain, Turkey, Egypt, Germany.  ≈íuvre  Landscape painting and still life were genres Ponikarov gave preference to. He painted using the wet-on-wet technique in watercolor on the premoistened paper that deprived dabs of paint of hardness. The artist painted in transparent watercolor, he didn't combine watercolor with other techniques and precluded the use of white paint (titanium dioxide PW6 or zinc oxide PW4) to obtain white color. White color is unpainted paper. Among landscape paintings of Ponikarov there are lots of works pictured Odessa and its environs since almost all his life was connected with this region. Examples of those works: ¬´Arcadia¬ª (1984), ¬´In Odessa Courtyard¬ª (1984), ¬´Winter on the Big Fountain¬ª (1986), ¬´Odessa. Proletarian boulevard¬ª (1986), ¬´Ilyichyovsk. Lighthouse¬ª (1986). However, Vasyl created a good many of his watercolor paintings on his journeys across Soviet republics and abroad: ¬´Dombay¬ª (1972), ¬´Karelian pines¬ª (1975), ¬´Lake in Sedniv¬ª (1980), ¬´Caucasian birches¬ª (1981), ¬´Rozluch. Carpathians¬ª (1983), ¬´Holosiivo. Ponds¬ª (1984), ¬´Vylkovo¬ª (1987). On journeys that served him as a source of new impressions artworks cycles like ¬´Ancient monuments¬ª, ¬´Channel Dnepr-Donbass¬ª, ¬´Pushkin reserve¬ª, ¬´In Gurzuf¬ª were painted. Cycles of art works painted abroad contain images of Paris, Rome, London, Prague, Barcelona, Budapest, Istanbul, Jerusalem and Cairo. In landscape painting the artist was giving pride of place to generous gifts of the South of Ukraine ‚Äì juicy, mature vegetables and fruits, vivid flowers. Watercolors of flowers united in series brought him great success. As a \\"King of flowers and emperor of sunflowers\\" a fine art expert from Alexandria M. Sheryf named Vasyl. Vasyl Andriiovych worked a lot and incessantly on floral compositions by moving up images to the frames of pictures, by approaching images as much as possible to spectators. He pictured flowers in contourless sketchy manner that makes possible to reproduce flowering, rustle, smell. As a rule, Vasyl Ponikarov worked on location finishing a watercolor painting in one session. Often he turned to work without planning it in advance. For example, departing somewhere on his car, Vasyl could pull up in the middle of the flowering field and turn to paint. Vasyl Andriiovych by creating several sheets a day for a half of century of his creative activity pictured tens of thousands of artworks that dispersed around the world. Ponikarov in Iryna Tymokhova (a fine art expert) opinion is one of the most productive artists. In this regard on the pages of news paper \\"Vechernyaya Odessa\\" Iryna Tymokhova compared the artist with I.K. Aivazovsky.

The method is versatile as interface structures of different optical regimes, e.g. geometrical and wave optics, can be included. It is very efficient due to the re-usability of the calculated light redistribution properties of the individual interfaces.Tucher, N.; Eisenlohr, J.; Goldschmidt, J. C.; Bl√§si, B. \\"A versatile formalism for optical simulation of textured sheets\\", SPIE Newsroom, It has so far been mainly used to model optical properties of solar cells and solar modules but it is also applicable for example to LEDs or OLEDs with light extraction structures.  History  The development of the OPTOS formalism started in 2015 at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE in Freiburg, Germany. The mathematical formulation has been described in detail in several open access publications. Eisenlohr, J.; Tucher, N.; H√∂hn, O.; Hauser, H.; Peters, M.; Kiefel, P.; Goldschmidt, J.

Continuous updates and a list of OPTOS related publications can be found on ResearchGate.  OPTOS simulation procedure  One key aspect of OPTOS simulations is the division of the modeled system into interface and propagation regions. The light redistribution properties are calculated with the most appropriate method for each interface individually and depending on the relevant structure dimension. Large scale structures can for example be modeled via ray tracing while for interfaces with structure dimensions in the range of the wavelength wave optical approaches like RCWA, FDTD or FEM can be used. Simulation procecure of the OPTOS formalism  System description  The discretization of the complete angular space into a fixed number of angle channels, as second key aspect of the OPTOS formalism, allows representing the angular power distribution within the system by a vector v which consists of one entry for each angle channel. The value of the entry is the power fraction of the corresponding angle channel with respect to the total incident power.  Interface interaction  The light redistribution properties of an interface are represented by the so-called reflection and transmission matrices, R and T. They store for each of the angle channels the redistribution information into other angle channels for light incident onto a certain interface with a certain wavelength. There are in total four different redistribution matrices for each interface, characterized by the incidence direction as well as reflection or transmission redistribution.  Propagation through the sheet  The incoherent propagation of light through the sheet can also be represented by a matrix. If no light redistribution takes occurs on the path, the propagation matrix D is a diagonal matrix. The single entries consist of the Lambert-Beer absorption factor, including cosine of the polar angle and the absorption coefficient of the respective material.  Calculation of optical properties  Using the pre-calculated matrices described above, optical properties like reflectance, transmittance or absorptance within the sheet can be calculated via matrix multiplications [2‚Äì4] and can be performed within seconds or minutes using a standard personal computer. Also a depth-dependent absorption profile can be calculated. This is of special importance for the subsequent electrical simulation of structured silicon solar cells.  OPTOS simulation characteristics  = Strengths = * Versatility ‚Äì Optical systems with interface structures operating in different optical regimes can be accurately simulated. The redistribution properties of each interface are modeled individually with the most suitable method. * Efficiency - The re-usability of the redistribution allow for the very fast simulation of different structure combinations, sheet thickness variations and the optical analysis with respect to different angles of incidence. * Linear polarization can be taken into account by exchanging each entry of the power distribution vector with two entries, one for each polarization direction. Each matrix entry has to be exchanged with a two by two matrix taking also the redistribution between different polarization directions into account. = Limitations = OPTOS couples redistribution properties of different interfaces. If there is no accurate modeling technique to calculate redistribution matrices, such interfaces cannot be included in OPTOS. OPTOS models the propagation through the sheet incoherently. If the sheet thickness becomes very low and interference effects play a significant role, this needs to be handled coherently and not as ‚Äúthick‚Äù sheet. However, as coherently modeled sub-system, it can be included in OPTOS as effective interface. Circular or elliptical polarization effects are not taken into account as all phase information is neglected during the propagation.  Application Examples  The main application of OPTOS has so far been the simulation of: * Solar cells with different front and rear side structures such as random pyramids, the isotexture, the honeycomb texture or diffractive gratings. * The layer stack of solar panels, including the effect of the encapsulation onto the optical solar cell properties as well as the investigation of different angles of incidence. * Complex optical interactions in photovoltaic systems with nanowire solar cells. Alternative fields of application could be: * LEDs or OLEDs with light extraction structures * Display technology, for example brightness enhancement films  References   External links  OPTOS page at Fraunhoer ISE website (includes documentation and download of basic version) OPTOS project on ResearchGate (with continuous updates and a list of OPTOS related publications) Physical optics ","title":"OPTOS formalism"},{"id":"53490634","title":"2012 Tajik Super Cup"},{"id":"53490635","text":"Nimesha Gunasinghe (born 12 June 1995) is a Sri Lankan cricketer.

It was part of a complex of three buildings (including a machine shop and waterworks, now demolished, located across Judd Street) built by Ephraim Shay. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. History Ephraim Shay was born in Ohio in 1839. He moved to Michigan in 1864 and eventually to Harbor Springs in 1888. He was already nationally known as the inventor of the Shay locomotive, typically used in logging applications. ON arriving on Harbor Springs, Say built an octagon house for his own use, and a nearby machine shop, where he constructed machines (including some of his eponymous locomotives) and manufacturing tools. About a year after the construction of the machine shop, Shay built a waterworks, which supplied Harbor Springs and Harbor Point with up to 100,000 gallons of water a day. A reservoir was constructed in 1894. Shay lived in his house until his death in 1916. The house was sold in 1924/25, and housed a series of commercial shops. As of 2017, it is privately owned and has been carefully restored. Shay sold the waterworks to the city of Harbor Springs in the late 1890s. The machine shop was later used as a city garage, and then as the city Fire Hall. Both buildings have been subsequently demolished, leaving the Hexagon House as the only remaining structure in the complex. Description The Shay Complex is composed of three structures: Ephraim Shay's private residence (known as the \\"Hexagon House\\"), his machine shop, and the waterworks. The Hexagon House, located at 396 East Main Street, is sheathed entirely of metal on a foundation of cut stone. The roof, originally of metal sheet, was later covered with asphalt shingles. The sheets of metal used to construct the house were embossed to give the appearance of brick. Interior walls are of pressed steel. The main body of the house is a two-story hexagon shape, and surrounding the center structure are four single-story hexagonal wings, each one a single room with five windows spaced around the perimeter. The room in the center was used as a sitting room, with the upper floor an observatory. Two main entrance halls lead to the front and rear of the house, and the center room opens onto a parlor, a dining / family room, a kitchen with a bath for the maid, and three bedrooms with two main baths. The interior was originally finished with oil paints in contrasting designs. The machine shop is located on Judd Street across from the Hexagon. It is a large single- story brick building with a hip roof covered in shingles. Windows are set in segmental arches. The waterworks is located just east of the machine shop. It has a partial hip roof covered in shingles. File:Shay Hexagon House, built in 1876 by Ephraim Shay, who sheathed it inside and out in stamped metal.

Bayer Edward A. Bayer is an American-Israeli scientist. Early life  Edward A. Bayer was born on January 4, 1947, in Detroit, Michigan, US to Adele A. and Harmon S. Bayer. Edward (‚ÄúEd‚Äù or ‚ÄúEddie‚Äù) spent most of his primary school years in a predominantly Jewish northwest Detroit neighborhood, where so many of his fellow Baby Boomers lived. Here his Jewish identity, and other aspects of his identity, was established. The eldest of four siblings, two brothers (Gerald E. and Charles S.) and later a sister (Irene S.), he demonstrated many talents at an early age by organizing creative games, baseball competitions, productions, nature outings and other diversions. His interest in science and animals was formed early as exhibited by many excursions with his brothers into the \\"wilds\\". When his family moved to the Detroit suburb of West Bloomfield, his first year in Junior High School, Ed continued his creative pursuits. Demonstrating remarkable artistic tendencies even as a toddler, he used his skills to produce a puppet show, designing and creating by hand all the puppets and guiding his brothers in every aspect of the production. Ed was known in High School as a jokester and often combined this with his love of Science, and repeatedly topped his Chemistry teacher by proving him wrong in a funny and delicate way. Education He graduated with B.Sc. and M. Sc. in Zoology and Biology in University of Michigan and Wayne State University. He immigrated to Israel in 1971. He then graduated a Ph.D. in biophysics from the Weizmann Institute of Science, under the supervision of Meir Wilchek. Edward A. Bayer became a professor in the Weizmann Institute of Science in 2001 and published over 400 scientific papers in reputed journals. He is a member of the Scientific Advisory Board, of US-Department of Energy BioEnergy Science Center (BESC) since 2008 and of the Israel VATAT Planning and Budgeting Committee: National Subcommittee on \\"Energy & the Environment\\" and also serves as editor in several distinguished scientific journals.

The Shahumyan Province is a modern analogue of their alternative local government, in their infancy. With adoption of tu duan and merger, these nominal subdivisions transitioned to the actual administrative divisions.  Background  Since the invasion of the five barbarians, a large number of northern refugees migrated south. These migrants who called \\"qiao ren (, literally the migrated people)\\" were the base of the migrated provinces, commanderies, and counties. Bearing northern place names, they were set up by Eastern Jin. Such a move was not unprecedented, the central government migrated the whole commandery or county to a new place as early as Han dynasty. However, they emerged on a massive scale since Eastern Jin.  History  During the Emperor Yuan, Emperor Ming and Emperor Cheng period, the migrated provinces, commanderies and counties were concentrated in the area south of the Huai River and the Lower Yangtze Plain. The earlier typical classic examples was migrated Langya Commandery (, its original counterpart in modern Linyi, Shandong) within migrated Fei County () in Jiankang, but they were certainly not the earliest. At least migrated Huaide County (, its original counterpart in modern Fuping, Shaanxi) was established in there, around 320 before that. According to the Book of Song: > (After Disaster of Yongjia, the refugees from You, Ji, Qing, Bing, Yan and > Xu provinces came across the Huai River, some even came across the Yangtze > River and stayed in Jinling Commandery... The migrated commanderies and > counties were established to govern them. The seats of Xu and Yan provinces > perhaps were moved to the area north of the Yangtze River, where the > migrated You, Ji, Qing, Bing provinces were established also.) = Purposes = * declaring the legitimacy of government * claiming to the occupied northern territory and evoking people's desire to resume * deadening the homesickness of qiao ren * manifesting the higher status of the qiao ren who came from the aristocratic clans * attracting the Han Chinese in the North cross the border to pledge to the South authorities * fostering economic growth The belts where qiao ren lived subdivided into 3 administrative levels, similar to the ordinary administrative divisions: * migrated provinces or qiao zhou () * migrated commanderies or qiao jun () * migrated counties or qiao xian () After Emperor Wu of Liu Song recaptured some lost northern territory, some of them there were prefixed with \\"north\\" or \\"bei\\" () to distinguish them from their migrated counterparts in the south. After Liu founded the Liu Song, the prefix bei was dropped while migrated place names that had derived from their prototypes in the north took on the prefix \\"south\\" or \\"nan\\" (). Still, there were a few exceptions to prefixed with \\"east\\" or \\"dong\\" () and \\"west\\" or \\"xi\\" (). For instance, Dong Jingzhao (, in modern Xingyang) and Xi Jingzhao (, in modern Hanzhong). As time goes by, the migrated provinces, commanderies and counties plunged the administrative divisions into chaos. For instance, Yinping County was located in the southeastern part of Gansu Province nowadays initially. While it had four migrated counterparts. = Development = = Baiji and huangji = Considering most property of qiao ren had been lost or exhausted as they arrived, they were privileged to be free from diao (), a special poll tax was paid via the silken or cotton cloth etc in the ancient China, and service. Their registers which bound in white papers were called baiji (') in Chinese. The ordinary ones which bound in yellow papers were called huangji (') in comparison. Over a given period, baiji was a preferential identification states the bearer's hometown. The imperial court had a specific intent, which scarcely be succeeded,to sort out hukou conveniently in the future after regaining the lost territory. = Abolition = Fan Ning () once submitted a memorial to the throne: > (In olden days, subdividing the territory was for the benefit of the > ordinary people; while a former noble monarch devised the system, he would > be fair to his people without distinction between huangji and baiji.

Once the situation settled down and the population swelled, the considerable amount of northerners flooding into the south magnified the economic and social problems. Reforms were clearly in order. Hence, tu duan was an increasingly important issue for the Eastern Jin and the subsequent Southern dynasties. = Tu duan policy = The tu duan (') is the abbreviation for yi tu duan (', means classifying people according to their present habitation).

The play is known in English as The Flower of Edo. The play is strongly associated with the Ichikawa Danj≈´r≈ç family of actors.  Plot  Events take place in Yoshiwara, a pleasure district of present-day Tokyo. Agemaki is a courtesan who is frequented by Sukeroku (who turns out to be Soga Gor√¥). Sukeroku is continually looking for fights. An old samurai called Iky√ª arrives and tries to coax Agemaki away from Sukeroku. Sukeroku does not succeed in provoking Iky√ª to draw his sword. A sak√©-seller named Shimbei shows up, and Sukeroku picks a fight with him, but Shimbei reveals himself to be Soga J√ªr√¥ (Sukeroku's elder brother) in disguise. Sukeroku explains to his brother (and later his mother) that he tries to provoke people into drawing their sword. If the sword turns out to be Tomokirimaru (their fathers sword), the person who holds the sword is probably the killer of their father and revenge can be exacted. Iky√ª tries to convince the brothers to join him. To demonstrate his power he hacks a leg of an incense burner. Thus revealing that his sword is in fact Tomokirimaru and he is Iga Heinaizaemon, an enemy of the family, and their father's killer. Quite often the play ends here, although there are versions where Sukeroku kills Iky√ª.  History  The work is derived from The Tale of the Soga Brothers. In popular culture The play is still regularly performed. The Ichikawa family secured its control over the play in 1832 using the title Sukeroku Yukari Edo Zakura. As the play is extremely popular, other families have developed their own versions, such as Sukeroku Kuruwa no Momoyogusa performed by the Onoe Kikugor√¥ line of actors. In Junichiro Tanizaki's novel, \\"Diary of a Mad Old-Man\\", Sukeroku is referred to five times at the beginning of Chapter I. Translation The play was translated into English by James R.

History  Carabinieri during riot control in 2015 While the 1st Carabinieri Mobile Brigade was established in its present form on 1 February 2001, together with Carabinieri Mobile Units Division, it can track its origins in the first formation grouping all Carabinieri units tasked with mobile, riot control and combat duties: the 11th Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade, established in 1963. = 1963-2001: 11th Carabinieri Brigade = Lieutenant General Giovanni De Lorenzo established the XI Mechanized Brigade when he was Carabinieri Commandant- General. Following the 1960 Genoa clashes, a reform project for the Mobile Battalions was envisioned, but later abandoned. Both the organization and the equipment (which included old Sherman tanks) were found to be obsolete either inadequate to emergency tasks.p. 48 In 1963, with the 1960s Army and Carabinieri reorganization, the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade was established directly under the General Command led by Giovanni De Lorenzo, in order to cope with the internal territorial defence needs. The establishment of the new brigade was in order to adjust the organization of the Battalions and of cavalry units both for strictly military tasks, and those related to the protection of public order. The aim was to ensure Carabinieri Battalions the availability of all elements necessary to be in a position to act in isolation and overcome considerable resistance without having to rely on the competition of other Army Corps or other Armed Forces, to ensure Battalions' speed of movement and concentration in large sectors of foreseeable use and a constant high training level. Overall, the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade consisted of about 5,000 men with 80 tracked vehicles, 200 other military vehicles, 130 M47 tanks and a paratroopers battalion. However, the brigade never had responsibility for actual unitary operational command, lacking supports due to a political choice, but exercised the tasks of instruction and preparation for the riot control activities. In the reorganization, Mobile Battalions were renamed simply Battalions and were marked with a sequential number, while remaining administratively dependent on the relevant Legion; the Battalions Groups were renamed Carabinieri Regiments, and were given the conceptual role of a resolution unit in both riot and tactical tasks; According original resolutions, Regiments were to have only disciplinary, training and deployment functions, while general management rested within the relevant Legion. The newly formed Mechanized Brigade exercised its operational and training authority on: * 1st Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Milan): commanding I, II, III and IV Battalions; * 2nd Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Rome): commanding V, VI, VIII and IX Battalions; * 3rd Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Naples): commanding X, XI and XII Battalions; * 4th Mounted Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Rome) with 2 Squadrons Groups (Battalion-level units) and 1 Armoured-motorized Squadron; * VII Battalion (directly under the Brigade Command), under IV Army Corps; despite being the newest Battalion, the unit inherited traditions and number of the second battalion of Rome, which was disestablished. * XIII Battalion (directly under the Brigade Command), under V Army Corps. The command structure of the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade consisted of: * Staff, with personnel management and training bodies; * Services Office, with activation and research tasks; * Army officers of Transmissions and Motorization organizations, with management, technical, inspecting and consulting tasks. Each Carabinieri Battalion was led by a lieutenant colonel or a major and consisted of: 1 Command Company (1 Command Platoon, 1 Services Platoon, 1 Scouts Platoon), 2 Rifle Companies (command platoon, 3 rifle platoons, 1 company weapons platoon each), 1 Mortars Company and 1 Tanks Company (Command Platoon, 3 Tanks Platoons). It was therefore a robust tactical complex. The Carabinieri Battalions had to be used only when the police and the local organization of the Carabinieri they had found insufficient, in order not to deprive the General Command of a valuable combat tool. Within the VII Battalion, based in Laives, the Counter-terrorism Special Company was established in 1960s to counter South Tyrolean terrorism;p. 187 the security operations were also supported by several Trucked Units. Both VII and XIII Battalions were to be always maintained at their full wartime force. The establishment of the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade was controversial: some senior officers criticized the decision, deeming that the essential features of the Carabinieri were capillarity and focus on criminal police activity. However, the 1963 reorganization did not mark the end of the organizational shifts. In 1964, 1st Carabinieri Helicopter Section was established. The XI Brigade was subordinated, on 7 March 1965, to the Inspectorate of Mechanized and Special Units, which included not only the XI Mechanized Brigade, but also all other tactical Carabinieri units: the Carabinieri Paratroopers Battalion, the Territorial Squadrons Groups of Milan, Cagliari and Palermo, the Trucked Units, as well as the naval service. Two years later, on 10 March 1967, the post was modified in \\"Inspectorate of Mechanized Units\\", being disbanded in May 1967. In 1968 the blue beret was modified, making it identical in shape to the maroon beret used by paratroopers. Between 1967 and 1968 it was set up the Inspectorate of Mechanized and Training Units (led by a Divisional general), with responsibility on the X Carabinieri Brigade (including schools) and XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade. In 1971 it was established the Inspectorate Schools and Special Carabinieri Units; it controlled the X Brigade (dedicated to training) and XI Brigade. In 1969, Battalions framed within Carabinieri Regiments were reorganized. The new structure consisted of Battalion Command Unit, Command and Services Company (Command and Services Platoon, Scouts Platoon, Transmissions Platoon, Tanks Platoon, Transportations Platoon), 2 Mechanized Rifle Companies (Command and Services Platoon, 3 Rifle Platoons, Mortars Platoons). Between 1973 and 1976, the 5th Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Mestre) also existed, including IV, VII and XIII Battalions. On 1 September 1977, 1st, 2nd and 3rd Carabinieri Regiments were disestablished and their Battalions were transferred under the direct operational and training authority of the 11th Mechanized Brigade; the 4th Mounted Carabinieri Regiment was renamed Mounted Carabinieri Regiment. In 1975 the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade changed its name in 11th Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade (with Arabic numerals) and in 1976 the formation was renamed 11th Carabinieri Brigade; at the same time, the Brigade Command was tasked to exercise only training and logistical authority. In 1977, the three Carabinieri Regiments were disestablished and 4th Carabinieri Cavalry Regiment changed its name in Carabinieri Cavalry Regiment, with the Battalions being directly under the Brigade Command. The following year an Inspecting Colonel was appointed, while in 1979 two additional Colonels followed. In 1980, the Inspectorate changed its name to Command Division School and Special Carabinieri Units \\"Palidoro\\". In 1985, the department was deprived of training component and was reorganized on the XI Brigade (Carabinieri Battalions) and the XII Brigade (specialist units); the brigade was therefore placed under a command called Carabinieri Mobile and Special Units Division \\"Palidoro\\". Overall, Carabinieri Battalions were divided into two groups, according to the main type (motorized or mechanized unit) of unit the unit deployed.  Operations  During the Years of Lead and the subsequent period, however, most of the Battalions reduced their military training in order to deal with riot control activities. 7th and 13th Battalions maintained instead their military capabilities and were transferred under direct Army operational control. Each infantry company of each Battalion established, in this period, an \\"Intervention Platoon\\", in order to upgrade the responsiveness to serious riots.p. 191 In the 1976 Friuli earthquake, the XIII Carabinieri Battalion \\"Friuli Venezia Giulia\\", IV Carabinieri Battalion \\"Veneto\\" and VII Carabinieri Battalion \\"Trentino Alto Adige\\" intervened paying rescue and providing police and utility services. In the 1980 Irpinia earthquake Carabinieri Battalions from Bari, Naples and Rome also intervened.pp. 203‚Äì204 = 2001-present day: 1st Carabinieri Mobile Brigade = Protesters burn a Carabinieri vehicle during the 27th G8 summit. With the transformation of the Arma dei Carabinieri in autonomous Armed Force, the 11th Carabinieri Brigade was split in two Brigades: the 1st Carabinieri Mobile Brigade controlled riot units, the 2nd Carabinieri Mobile Brigade was assigned combat-oriented Carabinieri Regiments. The two Carabinieri Mobile Brigades were grouped in the Carabinieri Mobile Units Division. The 1st Carabinieri Mobile Brigade was initially headquartered in Rome; in 2001 it was transferred in Treviso; in 2013 it was moved back in Rome. Some of its subordinate units, from being all Battalion-level entities, have been raised to the regimental status. On 10 September 2014 the 1st Carabinieri Battalion \\"Piemonte\\" was raised to Regimental status as 1st Carabinieri Regiment \\"Piemonte\\"; the 11th Carabinieri Battalion \\"Puglia\\" was raised to Regimental status on 18 September 2017.  Operations  The first major engagement of the newly formed Brigade was the 27th G8 summit, a major protest, drawing an estimated 200,000 demonstrators. Clashed erupted heavily; 329 people were arrested and over 400 protesters and about 100 among security forces were injured during the clashes. On the occasion, Carabinieri formed the shortly- existed Compagnie di contenimento e intervento risolutivo, units formed with personnel drawn from existing Battalions of the 1st Carabinieri Mobile Brigade (Battalions \\"Lombardia\\", \\"Lazio\\", \\"Toscana\\", \\"Campania\\" and \\"Sicilia\\"), integrated with personnel drawn from the more military-oriented 2nd Carabinieri Mobile Brigade. Critics of the CCIR frequently point out the militarization of police brought by the establishment of such units. On July 20, 23-year-old activist Carlo Giuliani of Genoa, was shot dead by Mario Placanica, a Carabiniere, during clashes with police. On 14 July 2007, 13 Italian Carabineri, GOMPI Mobile and prison police were convicted for abuse of authority, abuse of office and uniform. Other charges included abuse and negligence.  Mission  The 1st Carabinieri Mobile Brigade is tasked with: * Participation to the integrated defence of the national territory; * Participation in crowd and riot control during large demonstrations and events; * Surveillance on sensitive military objectives and those of civil nature defined, from time to time, by the Public Security authority; * Support to territorial organization to increase control of the territory in large urban and rural areas in the most sensitive areas in terms of public security; * Civil protection.  Organization  Emblem of 1st Carabinieri Regiment \\"Piemonte\\" The 1st Carabinieri Mobile Brigade is commanded by a Brigadier general, who in turn is assisted by a Staff.

Companies operate in small squads performing patrols in the urban context; they are also employed in extensive territorial control activities, such as patrols, checkpoints, spot-checks and raids. They have been established in 2000, within the 8th Carabinieri Regiment \\"Lazio\\" in Rome and within the Carabinieri Battalions in Milan, Florence, Naples, Bari, Palermo, Vibo Valentia and Mestre. Carabinieri assigned to the Operational Intervention Companies are selected and specially trained in Velletri to detect and deal with dangerous individuals, such as former offenders, drugs dealers and others. The training includes hand-to-hand combat, disarmament techniques, shooting and riot procedures. = Rescue Units = In order to allow Carabinieri Battalions to deal with emergencies in case of public calamity, special Rescue Units are established, when needed, within the individual Carabinieri Battalions. These Rescue Units are previously trained and provided with equipment and materials which allow them to provide initial assistance to people affected while awaiting the intervention of the civil protection system.

He began as a neuro-physiologist in Russia and after emigrating in 1976 he went on to study anthropology in Canada, England and the Netherlands. His academic work focuses on medical anthropology and European and Mediterranean studies. His literary work covers a diverse range of socio- cultural milieus and psychological perspectives, extending cultured and incisive insights into the human condition. He has lived in Italy since 1989.  Fields of research  Korovkin specializes in political and economic anthropology, symbolic expression and social organisation, and medical anthropology of stress. His articles have been published in journals that include Epistemology and Philosophy of Science (2011), European Journal of Sociology (1988), Comparative Studies in Society and History (1988), Language in Society (1987) and Current Anthropology (1986). Over the years, he has consulted on political and economic processes, power dynamics of social groupings and immigration policies for various government and private institutions, including the UN, both in Italy and Canada.  Formation  In Russia Korovkin studied biology and medicine at the Moscow State Pedagogical University and at I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University. He specialised in neuro-physiology and during his internship he worked at the Burdenko Scientific Research Neurosurgery Institute in the department directed by his uncle, Prof. Samuel M. Blinkov, co-author of the seminal work The Human Brain in Figures and Tables (S.M Blinkov, I.I Glezer 1964). After leaving Russia at the age of 27 he arrived to Canada where he studied cultural and social anthropology under Judith Nagata at York University. After winning a Doctoral Fellowship from Canada's Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), he spent a year at the London School of Economics (LSE) and went on to complete his studies the University of Amsterdam School for Social Science Research under Jeremy Boissevain.  Theoretical approach  In his anthropological work Korovkin‚Äôs treatment of the socio-cultural process can be seen as a concerted effort to ‚Äúreconcile the irreconcilable‚Äù namely ‚Äì structuralism and phenomenology. This leads him to a ‚Äúfractal approach‚Äù or to what he calls the quantum mechanics of symbols‚Äù by analogy with Heisenberg‚Äôs principle of uncertainty where the more is known about the meaning of the symbol the less is known about its entity, and vice versa.  Medical anthropology  In the field of medical anthropology Korovkin propones his particular cross disciplinary ‚Äúparabiotic‚Äù approach (i.e. Cannon, Richter, et al.) to coping with stress primarily in terms of its socio-cultural and physiological dynamics; teaching individuals and groups to develop analytical strategies of resilience and thus deal with stress competently rather than attempt to eliminate it (www.stressalternative.org). He is co-author with P. Stephenson of Zombie Factory: Culture, Stress & Sudden Death (2010). His treatment of stress falls within the canons of neuroanthropology: the anthropological aspect concerns primarily the role values play in the perception of stressors and somatisation of stress. The neuro-physiological treatment of the issue emphasises the patterns of stress rather than its intensity as a measurable physiological symptom.  Academic career  Korovkin has taught social and medical anthropology in Canada at McMaster University, the University of British Columbia and the University of Victoria. At the end of the 1980s he settled in Italy where he taught at the University of Bari, University of Perugia, Tuscia University, and Libera Universit√† Maria SS. Assunta (LUMSA) in Rome. He was Professor of Sociology and Communication Studies at ESE - European School of Economics, where he served as Academic Director from 2001-2004 at the Rome and Naples campuses. Currently he is Professor of Social Sciences at USAC - (University Studies Abroad Consortium).  Literary work  In 1991, the late Indro Montanelli, Editor-in-Chief of the leading Italian national daily Il Giornale, offered Korovkin a column on the newspaper‚Äôs cultural page Terza pagina. Montanelli was seeking to divulge a view on Russian political culture that would provoke a dialectical challenge to the ‚Äúradical-chic‚Äù notions dominant among European intellectual elites. With this in mind, he approached Korovkin with a plan to publish a pseudo Samizdat, which Korovkin agreed to write. Montanelli sent him to Russia as a special envoy in order to gather ethnographical material for the job at hand. For both Korovkin and Montanelli this ‚Äúeditorial operation‚Äù was not merely a gratuitous literary scherzo: it fronted a well considered notion that they shared, but could hardly expect to present personally, both due to their known ideological stands (‚Äúelegant right‚Äù Montanelli and ‚Äúelegant left‚Äù Korovkin) and their geographically vicarious position. The idea sustaining the novel is that Russia is a culturally feudal and idiosyncratically monarchic society, loving to hate their strong czars and falling apart under the weak ones; where the \\"tyrant\\" is a necessary product, simulacrum and even an ‚Äúexistential victim‚Äù of his own subject-people. The novel‚Äôs original title in English is Voice from the Orphanage: Memories of the Man Between Seasons. It is a sui generis rejoinder to what has been regarded as one of the first ever samizdat: A Voice from the Chorus (1976) by Abram Tertz (Andrei Sinyavsky). Korovkin‚Äôs reverts Tertz‚Äô thesis by presenting Russians as Stalin‚Äôs post-Perestroika perestroika orphans as opposed to repressed mass victims (chorus) of the Soviet regime. He correctly predicts what he saw would be the inevitable return of a strong authoritarian ruler. Montanelli personally wrote the introduction thus giving the work an imprimatur of ‚Äúauthenticity‚Äù; it was serialised in Il Giornale, and became the object of widespread interest and debate. Upon publication by Sperling & Kupfer the work, titled Orfani di Madre-Russia; Memorie di un Cinico (1992) written under the pseudonym Vadim Dubrovski, became a national bestseller. Following the success of ‚ÄúOrphans,‚Äù Korovkin was approached by the Italian publishing house Mondadori with a request to write another samizdat; this time the memories of a Moscow courtesan. Korovkin accepted the challenge, seeing the offer as an opportunity to write what he called ‚Äúthe first-ever feminist novel written by a man‚Äù. The novel, titled Dancing with Fat Cats: Memories of a Moscow Call Girl, was written in English under the pseudonym Lena Volgina. It was translated into Italian by the writer Stefania Pergola and published by Mondadori as Memorie di una ma√Ætresse moscovita (1994). Later, it was to be published under the original title in Russian translation by Aletheia (St Petersburg, 2004), and then re-published in Moscow by AST Publishers as Diary of a Moscow Courtesan (2005). It came out to wide critical acclaim, but apart from Katerina Nistratova, critics treated it as anti-Soviet, while Korovkin himself intended it as primarily ‚Äúanti-men‚Äù, with a Russian setting. The novel also provoked lively discussion on the Italian literary scene with Italian journalists eager to interview the mysterious ma√Ætresse. Notwithstanding the prestigious backing and successful initial promotion, the publication of the Korovkin‚Äôs writings in Italy in the early 1990s proved untimely. This was the period when the nation underwent the clamorous fall of the First Republic as government corruption surfaced through the institutionalised graft scandal known as ' (\\"Bribesville\\"). Thus, in the wake of the nation‚Äôs moral upheaval further promotion of the ‚Äúforged‚Äù novels was judiciously halted. Subsequently, however, he published other three novels in Russia under his own name: Once a Good Man and Short Stories (2001), Terms of Estrangement: Diaries of A Paratrooper (2002) and Excursion: Adventures of Modigliani the Ghost (2005).  Critique  Korovkin is described as ‚Äúa brilliant and ferocious poet whose furious, defiant but consistently classical and supremely elegant poetry, controlled and yet fluid, draws, without ever becoming heavy, on a very rich and varied cultural patrimony‚Äù (Franca Rovigatti, Roma Poesia 1998). His last book of poetry to-date is Fields of Vision: Selected Poems and The Soldier‚Äôs Tale (2014). It consists of 14 poems whose programmatic direction is best attested to by the title of the first piece of the volume: Looking for Faith. A large section of the book is occupied by The Soldier‚Äôs Tale: a completely new rendering of the fable used by Stravinsky for the homonymous suite and inspired by the latter. It bears the subtitle A Narcissus Variation ‚Äî narcissism in contemporary society is a topic that Korovkin repeatedly turns to both in his poetry and prose. In his poetic work, Korovkin often collaborates with American composer Jakov Jakoulov. He also intensively collaborates with Stephanie Morin. Currently they are working together on preparing for the publication of Morin‚Äôs research for a book titled Gold Fish in a Blender: An Essay on Approaches to Communicating Contemporary Visual Art.

The church consists of a chancel 20 ft. by 13 ft. 6 in., a north vestry 14 ft. by 7 ft., the nave 35 ft. by 16 ft. 6 in., and the south porch 8 ft. 6 in. by 8 ft.The Parish of Radwell - British History Online Constructed of flint and clunch rubble with the cement render removed in places, the chancel arch, window openings and the walls of the nave and chancel are probably mid-14th century in date, while the East window (a three- light window of about 1500 with decorative late 19th century glass given in 1885) and tower arch date to the early 16th century. The nave was restored in 1875, at which time the pews were added, while the chancel was restored in 1882, at which time the vestry and South porch were added. The short nave does not have an aisle and has only one window in each of the North and South walls. The steeply pitched roof has coped gable parapets, while above the West bay of the nave can be seen a bell-cot with a small broached copper spire over the timber bell chamber. A pointed arch separates the West bay as if the builders had intended to add a tower. The chancel arch dates to about 1340 and is similar in design to the tower arch but is more finely moulded, while the chancel's wagon roof is 19th century.Doubleday, A.H., The Victoria History of the County of Hertford, (1923)Nikolaus Pevsner and Bridget Cherry, The Buildings of England: Hertfordshire, (1977) The chancel arch shows traces of where at one time a rood screen was fixed across the archway, but this was presumably destroyed centuries ago. The large and undecorated baptismal font is 14th or 15th century in date and has shields carved in the recesses on its shaft. The communion rails are 17th century with square tapering balusters. The oak pulpit was given as a memorial to Frances Temple Proctor (died 1889), the wife of the Rector, the Rev Lovell Proctor, and their son Charles, who drowned in Bombay Harbour in 1906. Monuments Tomb of Mary Plomer (1605) On the South wall of the chancel can be found an effigy tomb to Mary Plomer, who died in 1605 at the age of 30 after giving birth to her 11th child. A fine example of rustic Elizabethan sculpture, she is depicted as a large seated frontal figure holding a chrisom child (removed from the effigy for safekeeping) with one foot on a skull and an hour-glass in her hand. The baby is wrapped in a linen chrisom-cloth which at that time was worn for a month after christening in order to protect the sign of the cross made with chrism oil on the baby's head during baptism. This monument suggests that the baby died within a month of baptism. A smaller figure of Time is displayed to the left, with the whole tomb surrounded by decorated piers. On the plinth below is a panel depicting kneeling effigies of her 10 children, showing she had six sons, two of whom are slightly recessed showing they had predeceased her, and her four daughters, with obelisks and achievement above. Effigy tomb of John Parker with his wife and son (1595) On the same wall is a monument to Ann Plomer (d.1625), with an inscribed slab framed by an arch and pediment with achievement above. On the North wall of the chancel is a monument with small kneeling figures of John Parker (d.1595), together with his wife and son in a surround similar to Mary Plomer's tomb but more modest. At the West end of the South chancel wall is a small leather plaque inscribed to William Pym (d.1729). On the South wall of the nave is a monument to William Plomer (d.1625) which displays Plomer kneeling at an altar with flanking obelisks and crests over an arch. Several memorials dating from the 18th century and later are on the nave walls. Several monumental brasses are set in the floor of the chancel, including in the North with one dedicated to Elizabeth Parker (d.1602), while in the South is a brass to William Wheteaker (d.1487), with his wife and son. In the North East corner of the nave is a brass to John Bele (d.1516) together with his two wives and children and the inscription \\"Pray for the soules of John Bele gentleman and Anne and Agnes hys wyfes, the whiche John decessed in the yere of our Lord God MVXVI\\".

Today, only ruins of the former fort can be found. The ruins are easily accessible by a pathway from the Ankobra Beach Hotel and frequented by tourists who enjoy the panoramic view of the site.  History  In the 17th century, the Ankobra River was an important means of transport for the gold trade in the area. Between the 1650s and 1680s, the Dutch had levied a toll from people using the Ankobra River at its mouth from a stone toll house, but abandoned it after Dutch influence in the area diminished and locals refused to pay the toll any longer. However, by the turn of the 18th century, French interest in the Ankobra River area made the Dutch take a renewed interest in the area, and after receiving a request from the local Azane people, the Dutch West India Company decided to build a lodge on the hill at the mouth of the Ankobra River. The trade at this lodge was so promising that in 1706, the company decided to extend it into a fort. Shortly thereafter, a conflict emerged between the Azane and other peoples at the coast, which eventually led to the abandonment of the fort by the Dutch in 1711. The fort was subsequently destroyed by John Conny in 1712. Archaeological excavations were done at the site of the fort in 1999 and the fall of 2011.

The neural activities are picked up by electrophysiological recordings from the brain (e.g. EEG, MEG, ECoG, etc.). It is a method to study the brain's neural communication and function at rest or during functional tasks.  History and basics  Initial applications of spectral analysis for finding the relationship between the EEG recordings from different regions of scalp dates back to 1960's. Corticocortical coherence has since been extensively studied using EEG and MEG recording for potential diagnostic applications and beyond. The exact origins of corticocortical coherence are under active investigation. While the consensus suggests that the functional neural communication between distinct brain sources leads to synchronous activity in those regions (possibly connected by neural tracts, in either direct or indirect way), an alternative explanation emphasises on single focal oscillations that occur at single brain sources that eventually appear connected or synchronous in different scalp or brain source regions. Corticocortical coherence has been of special interest in delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands (commonly used for EEG studies).  Methods, mathematics and statistics  Cortico-cortical coherence is commonly studied using bipolar channels of EEG recordings, as well as unipolar channels of EEG or MEG signals; however, unipolar channels are usually used to estimate the brain sources and their connectivity, using electrical source imaging and connectivity analysis. A classic and commonly used approach to assess the synchrony between neural signals is to use Coherence.Halliday, D. M., Rosenberg, J. R., Amjad, A. M., Breeze, P., Conway, B. A., & Farmer, S. F.

From August 1, 1934. as part of the reforms, the village is part of the Didyliv commune of Kamianka-Strumyliv district. According to old- timers, during the rule of the Poles, the village was repressed, including arson. = The village during the Soviet rule of 1939-1991. = In 1939, after the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, Soviet power came to the village. \\"In our village it was received with enthusiasm, because in our country, in Galicia, it was considered a reunification with Greater Ukraine,\\" said Volodymyr Kuk (a member of the OUN Security Council.). we haven't seen cheap ones before. My father went to the store and said that the Soviets were probably good people, they had brought so many products once. \\" But \\"enthusiasm\\" abruptly waned after Soviet \\"liberators\\" began repressing conscious Ukrainians, setting fire to villages, and so on.  OUN-UPA struggle against the Soviet occupiers  On August 15, 1944, after the battle of the \\"liberators\\" with the Ukrainian Insurgent Army detachment, the village was set on fire again by the Bolsheviks. Five insurgents from the OUN Security Service militant were killed in the battle. After the battle, the Bolsheviks carried out a \\"purge\\" and took away many men. From the chronicles of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army it is known that on April 26, 1944. in the village housed for one day a hundred \\"Poor\\". The next time the hundred stood guard in the woods near Yakimov on August 28, 1944. The forest was not suitable for them to live in, but because the rebels were caught in the day, they could not move. The rebels did not have time to rest after the hard road when the shots were heard. The Bolsheviks attacked the forest from two sides. The defense was difficult to conduct, so the commander of \\"Yastrub\\" decided to break through the road Lviv-Zolochiv and stay in another location. Fortunately, hundreds have succeeded. September 4, 1944 one family was arrested and deported. December 1, 1944 The Bolsheviks raided the village of Yakymov, where they captured one man, two girls, and killed two men from the special forces. During the same raid, the Bolsheviks burned three farms. December 4, 1944 another NKVD raid was carried out, two insurgents were captured during the raid and the morgue in the cemetery was burned. During the raid, a Bolshevik lieutenant said, \\"Dig for hiding places, because the actions will be intensified now.\\" In the end, he said that the war would end soon. December 4, 1945 The NKVD arrested two residents - Kruk J. and Makar M. In 1947, there was a Bolshevik garrison in the village, which had to keep order, because the village was considered nationalistic and dangerous for the new government, because there was constant resistance. The occupiers went from house to house, gathering people, campaigning for the people to vote for the communist Pelekhaty. The rebels called on the people to boycott the elections, to disregard the orders of the occupying power. Communications were broadcast in the villages \\"flyers\\", which urged residents not to obey and not to participate in elections. The peasants obeyed the rebels, and no one went to the polls, except the units to the death of intimidated people or supporters of the occupiers. Elections in the village were disrupted. The Bolsheviks began to teach the rebellious inhabitants. The village was cleansed ... During the so-called \\"cleansing\\", on March 20, 1947, a resident Anna Girna was arrested (they had two pieces of evidence: one - she is in the photo among the girls who were taught to be nurses by the rebels, the other - her handwriting under \\" flyer \\"). The consciousness of some villagers was so great that even children joined the struggle. They left the village and when they saw that the Bolshevik garrison was coming, they immediately let the villagers and insurgents know. Among those children was the younger sister of the above- mentioned Anna - Maria Girna, who on January 16, 1946. also arrested. Maria Hirna was a liaison. Mostly received and transmitted information received from the insurgents to Ubyn.

Cultural life of the village  On October 13, 2019, the village of Yakymiv was visited by the American astronaut Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper.
