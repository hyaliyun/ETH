State-owned Kerala State Road Transport Corporation buses, private buses, Indian Railways, state-owned Kerala State Water Transport Department boats & ferry, taxis and auto rickshaws are serving the city of Kollam. The city had a strong commercial reputation since the days of the Phoenicians and Romans. Ibn Battuta mentioned Kollam Port as one of the five Indian ports he had seen during the course of his twenty-four year travels.Kollam - Mathrubhumi Map of South Kerala Kollam City A Kollam city bus at Ramankulangara. The city services of Kollam were blue in colour. Now city buses follow Green colour as per the new bus colour code of Kerala. Kollam is known as the Cashew capital of the world. 90% of India's export quality Cashew Kernels are prepared from Kollam. It is the largest processed cashew exporter in the world. It is the headquarters of the Kollam District. The city of Kollam is home to the largest number of Bullet owners in India. As per the survey done by Royal Enfield in 2009, more than 60,000 bullet owners are there in Kollam city and nearly a lakh across the district. The enfield dealers in the city sells an average of 850 units every month. History Kollam Port during 1745 City of Kollam(Quilon) was known as the commercial capital of the Venad region (comprising Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam districts). Kollam Seaport (now known as Kollam Port) was founded by Mar Abo at Thangasseri in 825. Kollam's transportation have that much of historic background. Transportation in the past Kollam Airport was the first aerodrome in the present day state of Kerala. During the 1920s, there were no other civil aerodromes in the kingdoms of Cochin, Travancore and the Malabar District at the time of the British ruled Madras Presidency. The airport stopped its operations when an accident involving a training aircraft at the boundary of the aerodrome, resulted in the death of the pilot and the trainee. Kollam was the first city in South Kerala that got a rail connectivity. The first idea of a rail link from Madras to Quilon, the trading capital of the erstwhile Travancore Kingdom was conceived in 1873. Kollam–Sengottai railway line is the second railway line to come to the present day state of Kerala, the first in the native kingdom of Travancore. After a survey in 1888, work started in 1900 and was completed by 1902. The first goods train travelled on this route in 1902, while the first passenger train began its run in 1904. Before the arrival of rail networks in Trivandrum, Kings of old Travancore had used Kollam Junction railway station and Kollam Airport for their transportation needs. Kollam was the former capital of Venad Kingdom. The Madras-Quilon line was extended to the capital of the Princely State of Travancore on 4 January 1918.

Road Transportation The city and metropolitan area are served by major arterial roads that run either in an east-west or north-south direction. The intra-city transportation is mainly carried out by private buses whereas the inter-city services are carried out by KSRTC. Kollam is one among the five KSRTC zones in Kerala. The private city bus services in Kollam were blue in colour. Now buses in Kollam follows newly introduced colour code system like rest of Kerala and hence city buses are green and other moffusil buses are blue. As per the reports, there are 681 buses plying through the roads in Kollam district. There is only one Regional Transport Office(RTO) in the city so far which is Kollam RTO(KL-02). But there are 6 Sub-Regional Transport Offices in the district of Kollam: Karunagappally (KL-23), Kottarakkara (KL-24), Punalur (KL-25), Kunnathur (KL-61), Chadayamangalam (KL-81), Pathanapuram (KL-82). Bus stations There are two major bus stations and one bus terminal in the city.Depots - KSRTC official website * City bus station, Andamukkam * KSRTC bus station, Cutchery * Bus terminal, Tangasseri  City Buses of Kollam  There is no dedicated Urban Metro Transport company or corporation for Kollam. KSRTC's urban transport wing KURTC does very few AC buses to Punalur, Trivandrum and Kochi. Other wise the scene is completely dominated by green coloured private buses. The system suffers badly due to poor condition of buses, lack of speed, adequate passenger amenities or information system, lack of new routes on by- routes, lack of route numbering and rude behaviour of staff. There was an attempt to bring in number system a decade back which went in vain due to poor implementation and lack of co-operation. There is also lack of proper waiting sheds for passengers in bus stops of Kollam. Major city bus routes are, * Chavara - Elampalloor (near Kundara) * Chavara - Kottiyam * Chavara - Aasraamam/Uliyakovil * Kottiyam - Cutchery * Eravipuram - Thankassery * Perumon - Chinnakkada * Prakkulam - Chinnakkada * Ashtamudi - Perumpuzha (near Kundara) * Mayyanad - Cutchery (via Koottikada) * Kottiyam - Mevaram - Kallumthaazham - Karicode (by pass route) * Kottiyam - Modeenmukku - Karicode - Chavara Thekkumbhagom City buses also runs to Maruthady, Maammoottilkadavu, Thirumullavaram, Kovilthottam, Mangadu, Kuppana, Panayam, Kannanalloor etc. There is a logical need to extent the city buses ending in Elampalloor to Kundara Technopark, Kuzhimathikadu, Nallila (where there is a multiplex), Cheerankavu etc to bring in Kundara town also effectively integrated with the Kollam city bus network and to boost connectivity to outskirts. Lack of enough service on by-routes between Three main roads to Kollam from Kundara and two roads from Kottiyam has led to increase of number of two wheeler traffic in Kollam city in an unhealthy manner. Roads Kollam city Mevaram Junction in Kollam Bypass Kollam Metropolitan Area is a meeting point of 4 important National Highways of India. They are, * National Highway-66 - Thiruvananthapuram to Panvel (via Mevaram, Thattamala, Chinnakada, Cutchery, Mulamkadakam, Ramankulangara, Kavanad and Neendakara) * National Highway-183 - Kollam to Theni (via Chengannur, Kottayam) * National Highway-744 - Kollam to Tirumangalam (via Punalur, Tenkasi) * National Highway-183A - TItanium Jn. to Vandiperiyar (via Adoor, Pathanamthitta) Major neighbourhoods and suburbs connected with NH-66 Kottiyam → Umayanalloor → Mevaram → Thattamala → Pazhayattinkuzhi → Pallimukku → Madannada → Polayathode → College Jn. → Railway Station → Chinnakada → Cutchery → Collectorate → Mulamkadakam → Nellimukku → Medayil Jn → Ramankulangara → Vallikeezhu → Kavanad → Aaltharamoodu → Capithans → Sakthikulangara → Neendakara Major neighbourhoods and suburbs connected with NH-744 Chinnakada → Kadappakada → Randamkutty → Koickal → Kallumthazham → Moonnamkutty → Karicode → Kilikollur → Chandanathoppe → Keralapuram → Elamballoor → Kundara Major neighbourhoods and suburbs connected with NH 183 Thevally → Kadavoor → Anchalumoodu → Perinad In addition to that, some major roads like Asramam Link Road, Kollam-Paravur Coastal Road, Residency Road, Kollam Port Road, QAC Road, Kollam-Kulathupuzha road etc. are also connecting Kollam with other major cities, suburbs and towns in the state. Kollam Bypass Kollam Bypass is a road on NH 66 that bypasses CBD of Kollam City. The 13.141 km long bypass starts at Kavanad in the north to Mevaram in the south, via Aravila, Kadavoor, Kallumthazham and Ayathil.Kollam bypass: Central team conducts alignment study The Government of Kerala proposed the bypass in 1972 and thrown open to public in 2019.Talks held on NH bypass completion The bypass touches 3 major National Highways passing through the state. Rail Transportation Terminal-1 of Kollam Junction railway station Kollam Junction railway station is the major rail head of the city. It is the second largest and fourth busiest railway station in the state. World's second longest railway platform, which is more than 1 km long, is situated at this railway station. In a single stretch the total length is 1,180 m, which is second in the world. The station holds a MEMU Shed to manage short commuter rail services connecting the city with Ernakulam, Thiruvananthapuram, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Nagercoil and Kanniyakumari. The city is served by 4 railway stations. They are, * Kollam Junction railway station * Eravipuram railway station * Kilikollur railway station * Chandanathoppe railway station Railway stations in Kollam Metropolitan Area A MEMU train near Kollam MEMU Shed Kollam Metropolitan Area is served by the following 10 railway stations. * Kollam Junction railway station * Eravipuram railway station * Mayyanad railway station * Paravur railway station * Perinad railway station * Karunagappalli railway station * Ochira railway station * Kilikollur railway station * Chandanathoppe railway station * Kundara railway station Suburban Rail MEMU Shed office at Kollam Junction railway station A new suburban rail system has been proposed by the Government of Kerala and Indian Railways on the route Thiruvananthapuram - Kollam - Haripad/Chengannur for which MRVC is tasked to conduct a study and submit a report. Ten trains, each with 7 bogies, will transport passengers back and forth along the Trivandrum-Kollam-Chengannur-Harippad section. The Suburban Corridor is modelled on the lines of the Mumbai Suburban Rail, where around 3,000 suburban trains run every day.http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp- national/tp-kerala/new-drm-optimistic-about-suburban- project/article5547937.ece There is a huge potential for suburban rail that is left untapped within Kollam district. The Kollam - Punalur - Edamon section of Sengottai rail line which run parallel to busy and congested Kollam - Punalur national highway is suitable and highly viable for DEMU operations. Kollam MEMU Shed Kollam MEMU Shed is a motive power depot facility for maintaining MEMU rakes, situated in the city of Kollam in the Indian state of Kerala. It is one of the four MEMU rake maintenance sheds serving the Southern Railway zone of the Indian Railways.MEMU Maintenance Work Begins in Kollam Kollam MEMU Shed Presently, 5 pairs of MEMU services are now running from . The maintenance works of those rakes are regularly doing in Kollam MEMU shed. Air Transportation Old Kollam Airport area Currently there are no airports in the city of Kollam. However, Quilon Aerodrome at Asramam was the first aerodrome in Kerala. The first flight to Kerala landed at Kollam Asramam Airport. Now the old airport area is serving as a twin-helipad of the city, which is about 1 km away from the city center. The city is served by Trivandrum International Airport, which is about 56 kilometers from Kollam. Trivandrum International Airport is the first international airport in a non- metro city in IndiaTrivandrum International Airport and the only airport in Kerala having more than 2 Terminals. Daily domestic flight services are available from Trivandrum airport to major cities such as Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Bangalore and Kochi. International flight services connecting to Sharjah, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, Kuwait, Muscat, Male, Doha, Singapore and Colombo are available from here. The first Amphibian Aircraft (Seaplane) of Kerala also landed in Kollam. Kerala Seaplane Project Kerala Seaplane was a commercial seaplane service promoted by Kerala Tourism Infrastructure Limited in the Indian state of Kerala. It was launched on 2 June 2013 at Kollam with the inaugural flight being operated by Kairali Aviation. However, commercial operations could not start due to opposition from the local fishing community. The Kerala Government was keen on restarting regular operations of the project in 2014. The service was to be the first such service in mainland India, and the second in India after Jal Hans, which operates seaplanes in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Water Transportation A moving ferry at Ashtamudi Lake, Kollam City of Kollam is served by boats and ferry services operated by Kerala State Water Transport Department. Kollam is one among the 6 districts served by the inland navigation water transport facilities in the Indian state of Kerala. Kollam KSWTD Boat Jetty is situated near Cutchery. Kerala State Water Transport Department is operating daily ferry services from Kollam Boat Jetty that connect city of Kollam with the suburbs like Sampranikkodi, Guhanandapuram and Pezhumthuruthu. In addition to that, the District Tourism Promotion Council(DTPC) of Kollam is running Kollam-Alappuzha boat services on alternative days of the week. Kollam-Alappuzha tourist boat at Kollam KSWTD Ferry Terminal Kollam Port A distant view of Kollam Port The city of Kollam is served by Kollam Port (Thangasseri Port), which is the second largest port in Kerala. Kollam Port is one of the two International Ports in Kerala. Cargo handling facility had been kicked off at Kollam Port in 2013.Kollam port starts cargo handling. Accessed 29 July 2014. Foreign ships are now coming to Kollam Port regularly. The first foreign ship that reached the modern Port of Kollam after the independence of India was the MV Alina, a mammoth 145-meter vessel registered in Antigua. It anchored in the port on 4 April 2014. Nowadays foreign and domestic ships anchoring at Kollam Port is a regular scene of the city. Kollam Port is the closest sea port in mainland to Minicoy Island of Lakshadweep, there has been many discussions on introducing cargo and passenger ships in this route. However lack of refuelling and berthing facilities in Kollam port and poor political patronage, it is a non starter. Water Metro LDF government in kerala has initiated steps in implementing water metro in Kollam. This will be the second water metro in Kerala after Kochi. This project is expected to take lesser costs than cochin and expected to complete by 2018. This will be a big boost Kollam traffic planning and tourism. Since Kollam has the Trivandrum Shoranur canal passing north south from the city through suburbs like Eravipuram, Mayyanad, Paravur, Mundakkal, Kavanad, Chavara and Ashtamudi backwater and its branches connecting with major places along Kundara, Kallada, Perumon, Mangadu, Kallada, Thevalakkara, Munroe Island etc Water Metro can be a game changer in Kollam, if conceived, implemented effectively at the earliest.

It is believed that Guru Nanak attained enlightenment after taking a bath in the Kali Bein. In the wake of the Green Revolution, the Kali Bein became progressively polluted until it was cleaned and rejuvenated in a mass action led by Sant Balbir Singh Seechewal in the 2000s.  Etymology  Kali Bein literally means the Black Stream. It is called Kali ('black') due to the black colour reflected by the minerals in its waters. The Punjabi word 'bein' derives from the Sanskrit 'veni' meaning a stream or a water body. Beins are a feature of the plains and are marked by their zigzagging course.  Course  The Kali Bein rises from a spring in the Dhanoa village of Dasuya tehsil Hoshiarpur district of Punjab, India. Odhra rivulet, and Mukerian Hydel Channel are the main source of water for Kali Bein. After flowing for 160 km, it merges at the confluence of the Beas and the Satluj at Harike Pattan. The Kali Bein is also called the Western Bein in Hoshiarpur and its course lies parallel to the Beas in the Hoshiarpur and Kapurthala districts. The Kali Bein is also thought to be the abandoned riverbed of the Beas and its depth varies from 1.5 to 3 metres. The Bein's spring was brick lined during the Emperor Akbar's reign. The Chhoti Bein is a tributary of the Kali Bein. The Kali Bein flows through the districts of Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala and Jalandhar and there are several towns on its banks including Kapurthala and Sultanpur Lodhi. The Mukerian Hydel Channel at Terkiana is a major waterworks on the Bein that controls the flow of water downstream. The Kali Bein has a catchment area covering 945 square kilometers.  Sikhism  Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the founder of Sikhism, is believed to have attained enlightenment after taking a dip in the Kali Bein. Guru Nanak Dev Ji is said to have disappeared while bathing in the Bein only to reappear three days later. Guru Nanak Dev Ji then proclaimed that \\"There is no Hindu and there is no Musalman. There is only one God and all are equal before Him\\". The moolmantra of Sikhism, Ik Onkar, originated from this experience. The Gurudwara Ber Sahib, where Guru Nanak Dev Ji used to meditate under a ber tree, is located on the Kali Bein's banks in Sultanpur Lodhi.  Ecological concerns  Kali Bein plays a key role in recharging the water table and in flood management in its watershed. It is also a key source of irrigation for the agricultural fields there. The Kanjli Wetland, a Ramsar site (a wetland site designated of international importance under the Ramsar Convention), is supported by the Kali Bein. As a result of the Green Revolution, the use of industrial and agricultural chemicals and the exploitation of groundwater led to the drying up of the Kali Bein along parts of its course and the contamination of groundwater leading to diseases and the drying up of farmlands.  Clean up  The clean up of the Kali Bein was led by Sant Balbir Singh Seechewal who organised a kar sewa and roped in the Government of Punjab. Seechewal's efforts involved the clearing of water hyacinth and other weeds from the Bein, the building of bathing ghats and the construction of a road along the Bein. The kar sewa began in 2000 and till 2003 focused on cleaning up the Kali Bein near Sultanpur Lodhi after which the focus shifted to cleaning up the Bein between Dhanoa and the Kanjli wetland. Seechewal often referred to the Guru Granth Sahib and its verses exhorting the preservation of natural resources in his appeals for cleaning the Bein. 3000 volunteers a day worked under Seechewal for three and a half years to accomplish the revival of the Bein. It directly led to a rise in the water table and the reusability of hand pumps that had remained dry for several decades. Further, these efforts have contributed to eliminating the problem of water logging in the Kali Bein's upstream areas and improved the availability of water in its downstream areas resulting in improved irrigation and better crops. Despite Seechewal's success, the Kali Bein has continued to suffer in recent years. Inadequate release of water from Mukerian Hydel Channel, the flow back of polluted water from Harike and the failure of sewage treatment plants led to the mass death of fishes in the Kali Bein in 2013.

R. Pruppacher and J. D. Klett, Microphysics of Clouds and Precipitation, Kluwer (1997)P.G. Debenedetti, Metastable Liquids: Concepts and Principles, Princeton University Press (1997) Nucleation is the first step in the spontaneous formation of a new thermodynamic phase or a new structure, starting from a state of metastability. The kinetics of formation of the new phase is frequently dominated by nucleation, such that the time to nucleate determines how long it will take for the new phase to appear. The time to nucleate can vary by orders of magnitude, from negligible to exceedingly large, far beyond reach of experimental timescales. One of the key achievements of classical nucleation theory is to explain and quantify this immense variation. Description The central result of classical nucleation theory is a prediction for the rate of nucleation R, in units of (number of events)/(volume·time). For instance, a rate R = 1000 \\\\ \\\\text{m}^{-3}\\\\text{s}^{-1} in a supersaturated vapor would correspond to an average of 1000 droplets nucleating in a volume of 1 cubic meter in 1 second. The CNT prediction for R is ::R\\\\ =\\\\ N_S Zj\\\\exp \\\\left( \\\\frac{-\\\\Delta G^*}{k_BT} \\\\right) where :*\\\\Delta G^* is the free energy cost of the nucleus at the top of the nucleation barrier, and k_B T is the average thermal energy with T the absolute temperature and k_B the Boltzmann constant. :*N_S is the number of nucleation sites. :*j is the rate at which molecules attach to the nucleus. :*Z is the Zeldovich factor, which gives the probability that a nucleus at the top of the barrier will go on to form the new phase, rather than dissolve. This expression for the rate can be thought of as a product of two factors: the first, N_S \\\\exp \\\\left( -\\\\Delta G^*/k_BT \\\\right), is the number of nucleation sites multiplied by the probability that a nucleus of critical size has grown around it. It can be interpreted as the average, instantaneous number of nuclei at the top of the nucleation barrier. Free energies and probabilities are closely related by definition. The probability of a nucleus forming at a site is proportional to \\\\exp[-\\\\Delta G^*/kT]. So if \\\\Delta G^* is large and positive the probability of forming a nucleus is very low and nucleation will be slow. Then the average number will be much less than one, i.e., it is likely that at any given time none of the sites has a nucleus. The second factor in the expression for the rate is the dynamic part, Zj. Here, j expresses the rate of incoming matter and Z is the probability that a nucleus of critical size (at the maximum of the energy barrier) will continue to grow and not dissolve. The Zeldovich factor is derived by assuming that the nuclei near the top of the barrier are effectively diffusing along the radial axis. By statistical fluctuations, a nucleus at the top of the barrier can grow diffusively into a larger nucleus that will grow into a new phase, or it can lose molecules and shrink back to nothing. The probability that a given nucleus goes forward is Z. Taking into consideration kinetic theory and assuming that there is the same transition probability in each direction, it is known that x^2 = 2D t. As Zj determines the hopping rate, the previous formula can be rewritten in terms of the mean free path and the mean free time \\\\lambda^2 = 2D \\\\tau. Consequently, a relation of Zj in terms of the diffusion coefficient is obtained > Zj = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau} = \\\\frac{2D}{\\\\lambda^2}. Further considerations can be made in order to study temperature dependence. Therefore, Einstein-Stokes relation is introduced under the consideration of a spherical shape > D = \\\\frac{k_B T}{6 \\\\pi \\\\eta \\\\lambda}, where \\\\eta is the material's > viscosity. Considering the last two expressions, it is seen that Zj \\\\propto T. If T \\\\approx T_m, being T_m the melting temperature, the ensemble gains high velocity and makes Zj and \\\\Delta G^* to increase and hence, R decreases. If T \\\\ll T_m, the ensemble has a low mobility, which makes R to decrease as well. To see how this works in practice we can look at an example. Sanz and coworkers have used computer simulation to estimate all the quantities in the above equation, for the nucleation of ice in liquid water. They did this for a simple but approximate model of water called TIP4P/2005. At a supercooling of 19.5 °C, i.e., 19.5 °C below the freezing point of water in their model, they estimate a free energy barrier to nucleation of ice of \\\\Delta G^*=275k_BT. They also estimate a rate of addition of water molecules to an ice nucleus near the top of the barrier of j = 10^{11} \\\\ \\\\text{s}^{-1} and a Zeldovich factor Z = 10^{-3}. The number of water molecules in 1 m3 of water is approximately 1028. These leads to the prediction R = 10^{-83} \\\\ \\\\text{s}^{-1}, which means that on average one would have to wait 1083s (1076 years) to see a single ice nucleus forming in 1 m3 of water at -20 °C! This is a rate of homogeneous nucleation estimated for a model of water, not real water — in experiments one cannot grow nuclei of water and so cannot directly determine the values of the barrier \\\\Delta G^*, or the dynamic parameters such as j, for real water. However, it may be that indeed the homogeneous nucleation of ice at temperatures near -20 °C and above is extremely slow and so that whenever water freezes at temperatures of -20 °C and above this is due to heterogeneous nucleation, i.e., the ice nucleates in contact with a surface.  Homogeneous nucleation  Homogeneous nucleation is much rarer than heterogeneous nucleation. However, homogeneous nucleation is simpler and easier to understand than heterogeneous nucleation, so the easiest way to understand heterogeneous nucleation is to start with homogeneous nucleation. So we will outline the CNT calculation for the homogeneous nucleation barrier \\\\Delta G^*. thumb|The green curve is the total (Gibbs if this is at constant pressure) free energy as a function of radius. Shown is the free energy barrier, \\\\Delta G^*, and radius at the top of the barrier, r*. This total free energy is a sum of two terms. The first is a bulk term, which is plotted in red. This scales with volume and is always negative. The second term is an interfacial term, which is plotted in black. This is the origin of the barrier. It is always positive and scales with surface area. To understand if nucleation is fast or slow, \\\\Delta G(r) needs to be calculated. The classical theoryF. F. Abraham (1974) Homogeneous nucleation theory (Academic Press, NY). assumes that even for a microscopic nucleus of the new phase, we can write the free energy of a droplet \\\\Delta G as the sum of a bulk term that is proportional to the volume of the nucleus, and a surface term, that is proportional to its surface area :\\\\Delta G = \\\\frac{4}{3} \\\\pi r^3 \\\\Delta g_v + 4 \\\\pi r^2 \\\\sigma The first term is the volume term, and as we are assuming that the nucleus is spherical, this is the volume of a sphere of radius r. \\\\Delta g_v is the difference in free energy per unit volume between the thermodynamic phase nucleation is occurring in, and the phase that is nucleating. For example, if water is nucleating in supersaturated air, then \\\\Delta g_v is the free energy per unit volume of the supersaturated air minus that of water at the same pressure. As nucleation only occurs when the air is supersaturated, \\\\Delta g_v is always negative. The second term comes from the interface at surface of the nucleus, which is why it is proportional to the surface area of a sphere. \\\\sigma is the surface tension of the interface between the nucleus and its surroundings, which is always positive. For small r the second surface term dominates and \\\\Delta G(r)>0. The free energy is the sum of an r^2 and r^3 terms. Now the r^3 terms varies more rapidly with r than the r^2 term, so as small r the r^2 term dominates and the free energy is positive while for large r, the r^3 term dominates and the free energy is negative. This shown in the figure to the right. Thus at some intermediate value of r, the free energy goes through a maximum, and so the probability of formation of a nucleus goes through a minimum. There is a least-probable nucleus size, i.e., the one with the highest value of \\\\Delta G where > \\\\left[\\\\frac{dG}{dr}\\\\right]_{r=r_c} = 0 \\\\implies r_c = \\\\frac{2\\\\sigma}{|\\\\Delta > g_v|} Addition of new molecules to nuclei larger than this critical radius, r_c, decreases the free energy, so these nuclei are more probable. The rate at which nucleation occurs is then limited by, i.e., determined by the probability, of forming the critical nucleus. This is just the exponential of minus the free energy of the critical nucleus \\\\Delta G^*, which is ::\\\\Delta G^* = \\\\frac{16 \\\\pi \\\\sigma ^3}{3|\\\\Delta g_v|^2} This is the free energy barrier needed in the CNT expression for R above. From an experimental standpoint, this theory grants tuning of the critical radius through the dependence of \\\\Delta G on temperature. The variable \\\\Delta g_v, described above, can be expressed as : \\\\Delta G = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta H_f(T_m - T)}{T_m} \\\\implies \\\\Delta g_v = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta H_f(T_m - T)}{V_{at} T_m} where T_m is the melting point and H_f is the enthalpy of formation for the material. Furthermore, the critical radius can be expressed as : r_c\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\frac{2\\\\sigma}{\\\\Delta H_f}\\\\frac{V_{at} T_m}{T_m - T} \\\\implies \\\\Delta G^* = \\\\frac{16\\\\pi \\\\sigma^3}{3 (\\\\Delta H_f)^2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{V_{at} T_m}{T_m - T}\\\\right)^2 revealing a dependence of reaction temperature. Thus as you increase the temperature near T_m , the critical radius will increase. Same happens when you move away from the melting point, the critical radius and the free energy decrease.  Heterogeneous nucleation  Three droplets on a surface, illustrating decreasing contact angles. The contact angle the droplet surface makes with the solid horizontal surface decreases from left to right. A diagram featuring all of the factors that affect heterogeneous nucleation Unlike homogeneous nucleation, heterogeneous nucleation occurs on a surface or impurity. It is much more common than homogeneous nucleation. This is because the nucleation barrier for heterogeneous nucleation is much lower than for homogeneous nucleation. To see this, note that the nucleation barrier is determined by the positive term in the free energy \\\\Delta G, which is proportional to the total exposed surface area of a nucleus. For homogeneous nucleation the surface area is simply that of a sphere. For heterogeneous nucleation, however, the surface area is smaller since part of the nucleus boundary is accommodated by the surface or impurity onto which it is nucleating. There are several factors which determine the precise reduction in the exposed surface area. As shown in a diagram on the left, these factors include the size of the droplet, the contact angle, \\\\theta, between the droplet and surface, and the interactions at the three phase interfaces: liquid-solid, solid-vapor, and liquid-vapor. The free energy needed for heterogeneous nucleation, \\\\Delta G ^{het}, is equal to the product of homogeneous nucleation, \\\\Delta G^{hom}, and a function of the contact angle, f(\\\\theta): > \\\\Delta G^{het}= f(\\\\theta) \\\\Delta G^{hom}, \\\\qquad > f(\\\\theta)=\\\\frac{2-3\\\\cos\\\\theta+\\\\cos^{3}\\\\theta}{4}. The schematic to the right illustrates the decrease in the exposed surface area of the droplet as the contact angle decreases. Deviations from a flat interface decrease the exposed surface even further: there exist expressions for this reduction for simple surface geometries. In practice, this means that nucleation will tend to occur on surface imperfections. Difference in energy barriers Statistical mechanical treatment The classical nucleation theory hypothesis for the form of \\\\Delta G can be examined more rigorously using the tools of statistical mechanics.The discussion which follows draws from Kalikmanov (2001), unless noted otherwise. Specifically, the system is modeled as a gas of non-interacting clusters in the grand canonical ensemble. A state of metastable equilibrium is assumed, such that the methods of statistical mechanics hold at least approximately. The grand partition function is : Q = \\\\sum_{N=0}^{\\\\infty}z^N \\\\sum_{\\\\mu_S N} e^{-\\\\beta \\\\mathcal{H}_N(\\\\mu_S)}, \\\\qquad z \\\\equiv e^{\\\\beta \\\\mu}. Here the inner summation is over all microstates \\\\mu_S which contain exactly N particles. It can be decomposed into contributions from each possible combination of clusters which results in N total particles. For instance, : \\\\sum_{\\\\mu_S N = 3} e^{-\\\\beta \\\\mathcal{H}_3(\\\\mu_S)} = q_3 + q_2q_1 + \\\\frac{1}{3!} q_1^3 where q_n is the configuration integral of a cluster with n particles and potential energy U_n\\\\left(\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{r_n}\\\\\\\\}\\\\right): : \\\\begin{align} q_n = \\\\frac{1}{n!} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Lambda^{3n}} \\\\int d \\\\mathbf{r}^n e^{-\\\\beta U_n\\\\left(\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{r_n}\\\\\\\\}\\\\right)}. \\\\end{align} (The quantity \\\\Lambda is the thermal de Broglie wavelength of the particle, which enters due to the integration over the 3n momentum degrees of freedom.) Note that the inverse factorials are included in the above expressions to compensate for overcounting, since particles and clusters alike are assumed indistinguishable. More compactly, : Q = \\\\exp \\\\left[ \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} q_n z^n \\\\right] . Then, by expanding Q in powers of q_m z^m, one can check that the probability P(m,\\\\ell) of finding exactly \\\\ell clusters which each has m particles is : \\\\begin{align} P(m,\\\\ell) &= \\\\frac{z^{\\\\ell m} q_{m}^{\\\\ell}}{\\\\ell!} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\exp \\\\left(\\\\sum_{n eq m}^{\\\\infty} q_n z^n \\\\right)}{\\\\exp \\\\left(\\\\sum_{n =1}^{\\\\infty} q_n z^n \\\\right)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{z^{\\\\ell m} q_{m}^{\\\\ell}}{\\\\ell!} \\\\exp \\\\left(-q_m z^m \\\\right). \\\\end{align} The number density \\\\rho_m of m-clusters can therefore be calculated as : \\\\begin{align} \\\\rho_m &= \\\\frac{1}{V} \\\\sum_{\\\\ell = 0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\ell \\\\frac{z^{\\\\ell m} q_{m}^{\\\\ell}}{\\\\ell!} \\\\exp \\\\left(-q_m z^m \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{z^{m} q_{m}}{V}. \\\\end{align} This is also called the cluster size distribution. The grand potential \\\\Omega is equal to -k_B T \\\\ln Q, which, using the thermodynamic relationship \\\\Omega = -p V, leads to the following expansion for the pressure: : \\\\frac{p}{k_B T} = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{q_n}{V} z^n. If one defines the right hand side of the above equation as the function \\\\Pi(T, z), then various other thermodynamic quantities can be calculated in terms of derivatives of \\\\Pi with respect to z.Kalikmanov (2001) pp. 172-173 The connection with the simple version of the theory is made by assuming perfectly spherical clusters, in which case U_n\\\\left(\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{r_n}\\\\\\\\}\\\\right) depends only on n, in the form : U_n = -E_0 n + w n^{1/2} where E_0 is the binding energy of a single particle in the interior of a cluster, and w > 0 is the excess energy per unit area of the cluster surface. Then, q_n \\\\propto \\\\exp( -\\\\beta \\\\cdot (-E_0 n + w n^{1/2})), and the cluster size distribution is : \\\\rho_n \\\\propto e^{-\\\\beta [ -(E_0 + \\\\mu) n + \\\\beta w n^{1/2}]}, which implies an effective free energy landscape \\\\Delta G(n) = -(E_0 + \\\\mu) n + w n^{1/2}, in agreement with the form proposed by the simple theory. On the other hand, this derivation reveals the significant approximation in assuming spherical clusters with U_n\\\\left(\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{r_n}\\\\\\\\}\\\\right) = -E_0 n + w n^{1/2}. In reality, the configuration integral q_n contains contributions from the full set of particle coordinates \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{r_n}\\\\\\\\}, thus including deviations from spherical shape as well as cluster degrees of freedom such as translation, vibration, and rotation. Various attempts have been made to include these effects in the calculation of q_n, although the interpretation and application of these extended theories has been debated. A common feature is the addition of a logarithmic correction \\\\sim \\\\ln n to \\\\Delta G(n), which plays an important role near the critical point of the fluid. Limitations Classical nucleation theory makes a number of assumptions which limit its applicability. Most fundamentally, in the so-called capillarity approximation it treats the nucleus interior as a bulk, incompressible fluid and ascribes to the nucleus surface the macroscopic interfacial tension \\\\sigma, even though it is not obvious that such macroscopic equilibrium properties apply to a typical nucleus of, say, 50 molecules across.Kalikmanov (2013), p. 21Oxtoby (1992), p. 7631 In fact, it has been shown that the effective surface tension of small droplets is smaller than that of the bulk liquid.Kiang, et al (1971) In addition, the classical theory places restrictions on the kinetic pathways by which nucleation occurs, assuming clusters grow or shrink only by single particle adsorption/emission. In reality, merging and fragmentation of entire clusters cannot be excluded as important kinetic pathways in some systems. Particularly in dense systems or near the critical point – where clusters acquire an extended and ramified structure – such kinetic pathways are expected to contribute significantly. The behavior near the critical point also suggests the inadequacy, at least in some cases, of treating clusters as purely spherical.Sator (2003) Various attempts have been made to remedy these limitations and others by explicitly accounting for the microscopic properties of clusters. However, the validity of such extended models is debated. One difficulty is the exquisite sensitivity of the nucleation rate R to the free energy \\\\Delta G^{*}: even small discrepancies in the microscopic parameters can lead to enormous changes in the predicted nucleation rate. This fact makes first-principles predictions nearly impossible. Instead, models must be fit directly to experimental data, which limits the ability to test their fundamental validity.Oxtoby (1992), p. 7638–7640 Comparison with simulation and experiment For simple model systems, modern computers are powerful enough to calculate numerically exact nucleation rates. One such example is the nucleation of the crystal phase in the model of hard spheres. This is a simple model of some colloids consisting of perfectly hard spheres in thermal motion. The agreement of CNT with the calculated rates for this system confirms that the classical theory is a very reasonable approximate theory. For the simple models CNT works quite well, however it is unclear if it describes complex (e.g. molecular) systems equally well. Jones et al. computationally explored the nucleation of small Water cluster using classical water model. It was found that CNT could describe the nucleation of clusters of 8-50 water molecules well, but failed to describe smaller clusters. Corrections to CNT, obtained from higher accuracy methods such as quantum chemical calculations, can provide necessary interactions for accurate nucleation rates. However, the CNT fails in describing experimental results of vapour to liquid nucleation even for model substances like Argon by several orders of magnitude.A. Fladerer, R.

Shankara refers to these six waves in his Vivekachudamani (shloka 257) thus:- :षडभिरूर्मिभिरयोगी योगीह्र्दभावितं न करणैविभावितम् :बुद्ध्यवेद्यमनवद्यमूर्ति यद् ब्रह्म तत्वमसि भावयात्मनि |:\\"That which is not affected by the six waves, which is meditated on in the minds of the yogins, which cannot be apprehended by the sense-organs, which is unknowable by the intellect, which is flawless excellence, thou art That. Meditate on It in thy mind.\\" Śri Candraśekhara Bhāratī of Śrngeri in his commentary explains that thirst, hunger, grief, delusion, old age and death, these six, though unconnected with Brahman, arise again and again, in as many waves; the first two i.e. thirst and hunger, belong to the prana, grief and delusion belong to the mind, and old age and death to the body. Pipāsā or 'thirst', is same as craving which later word is not used in the positive context. Kshudhā or hunger, too has a negative connotation just as thirst. Śhoka or 'grief', according to Bharata, is a sthayi bhava ('basic emotion') of karuna rasa ('aesthetic experience involving pain'). Moha or 'delusion' is a main obstacle to attainment of liberation i.e. moksha. Jarā or 'old age' helps a sincere devotee become fearless and happy, for he then no longer fears death. And, according to Atharvaveda, Mrtyu or death, as the messenger of Yama, dominates the living beings, and Yama rules them after their death.

The film is a fictitious thriller inspired by true events; it is told from the perspective of the Indian cop, Amod Kanth, who handled the case of the Indian Orgin French serial killer Charles Sobhraj who was known as the bikini killer. The film opened on 31 October 2015 to positive reviews across India. However, it was a box office bomb, collecting a mere Rs. 6 crores. The film stars Randeep Hooda, Richa Chadda, Adil Hussain, Tisca Chopra, and Alexx O'Nell in lead roles. Through the narrative, we see a series of crimes committed by Charles and the story of each of his victims, who fell for his charisma but were betrayed by his serpentine nature. The man not just escaped several high security jails but also manipulated the legal system. In the title, Main aur Charles, the word 'Main' stands for the character of Amod Kanth. The film was warmly accepted in the trade for its impeccable direction, casting and background score. Apart from these technicalities, the film has satisfied critics creatively with fine performances by Hooda, Chadha and Hussain.

It was located in the East End Neighborhood in Rochester, NY. History and Store Description The store was named after Hart's Groceries, which had over 100 locations in and around the city Rochester, NY by the 1920s. They were considered one of the first grocer to use store-brand labels and were also the first self-service grocery market. Hart's has attracted considerable interest in Downtown Rochester since its opening was announced in January 2014, primarily because downtown Rochester had not had a full-services grocery since the closing of Midtown Market formerly Wegmans Midtown in 2002. The store's opening coincided with ongoing efforts to redevelop the former Midtown Plaza site on Main Street and the arrival in the downtown area of thousands of new residents in apartments and condominiums. The Mayor of Rochester, NY Lovely Warren, was quoted saying \\"For too long, downtown has been a food desert, our East End is already vibrant and the addition of will add to the vitality of the neighborhood\\". The 20,000-square-foot store carried local produce, dairy, meats and baked goods and a wide variety of prepared foods, offering online ordering and online shopping. The grocery, was independently owned and financed in part through a private investor group. The store was next to the Little Theatre. On March 11, 2019, it was announced that Hart's would close after five years in business on March 24, 2019 due to declining sales and a inability to find a new owner.

Established in 1794, it is the oldest Catholic parish in the City of Washington. History St. Patrick's Church was founded in 1794 to minister to the needs of the Irish American stonemasons building the White House and the U.S. Capitol. Dominican priest Anthony Caffry O.P., recently arrived from County Mayo, Ireland, was charged by Bishop John Carroll with establishing the first Roman Catholic parish in the City of Washington. Caffry's decision to undertake the project was likely influenced by Irish architect James Hoban, one of the supervising architects on the Capitol building. Hoban asked Caffry to consider the Irish stone workers building the new federal capital. Caffrey first began celebrating Mass in rented spaces in the beginning of the year, but later built a modest, one-and-a-half story wood-frame church with the meager funds the parish had. Caffrey resigned in 1804 and was reassigned to New York. He was followed by William Matthews who oversaw construction of a new, larger church in 1809 on the site of the original building. The brick, Gothic Revival church was completed in 1816. This new St. Patrick's was consecrated by Archbishop John Carroll, and the Mass was concelebrated by coadjutor Bishop Leonard Neale, Matthews' maternal uncle. During the War of 1812, British troops invaded Washington, D.C. in 1814. As they advanced to within two blocks of St. Patrick's Church, fire from surrounding buildings spread to the roof of St. Patrick's. Matthews barricaded himself and others inside the sanctuary while most of the city's population fled. He went to the roof to put out the fire, then persuaded General Robert Ross not to destroy the church. In 1825, Matthews founded the St. Vincent's Female Orphan Asylum and brought the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul from Emmitsburg, Maryland to run it. Mother Juliana, the local superior, was Matthews' niece. Matthews was pastor from 1804 until his death in 1854. Rev. Timothy O'Toole, an Irish immigrant who had attended seminary of St Patrick's College, Maynooth in Ireland, was pastor from 1854 to 1860. During his tenure, he founded the Father Mathew Total Abstinence society, the parochial school, and St. Joseph's Orphan Asylum for Boys. O'Toole was followed by Jacob Ambrose Walter, who, in November 1872, saw the cornerstone laid for the new church. The first mass was said in the new church on November 2, 1884. It was dedicated on December 28, 1884. A long-time listing on the National Register of Historic Places, St. Patrick's is not without controversy. Radical renovations to the sanctuary in 1994 witnessed the removal and subsequent destruction of the church's original high altar, communion rail, consecration stones, and some artwork. The National Register considered taking formal, perhaps legal, action over the unprecedented violation of regulation.National Register of Historic Places National Register of Historic Places;09/24/2015 12:22 PM Pope Francis visited Saint Patrick's Church on September 24, 2015 during his tour of the United States.Pope Francis Skips Lunch With Politicians To Be With Homeless In Washington, D.C. Huffington Post;09/24/2015 12:22 PM Blue Mass Blue mass at St. Patrick's in 2013 The Blue Mass dates to September 29, 1934, when Rev. Thomas Dade started the celebration as part of his duties with the Catholic Police and Fireman’s Society. Rev. Dade's brother was a policeman in Baltimore, which boasted a healthy Catholic Police and Fireman's Society. Rev. Dade noticed that there was no such fraternal association in Washington, DC and lobbied the Washington, DC Commissioners to allow him to create one. The Washington, DC branch of the CPFS was opened in 1934. That first Mass has grown to a nationwide celebration. The September 29 celebration was timed to coincide with Michaelmas, the feast of Saint Michael the Archangel, the patron military saint of police officers and military.

Completed in 1911, it was one of three buildings that collectively made up the Ankeny Car Barns complex of the Portland Railway, Light and Power Company (PRL&P;), the owner and operator of Portland's streetcar system at the time. By 1978, the brick building had become the only surviving structure from the Ankeny complex and one of only two surviving remnants of carbarn complexes of the Portland area's large street railway and interurban system of the past, the other being the PRL&P;'s Sellwood Division Carbarn Office and Clubhouse. The original Ankeny carbarn was built in 1892 by the City and Suburban Railway Company, one of PRL&P;'s predecessors. It was located at 24th and East Burnside, but after fire destroyed it in 1894 it was rebuilt at 28th and East Burnside, on the east side of 28th. The complex was expanded in 1901 and 1910 through the construction of additional buildings, including Bays D and E, located west of 28th Avenue between Burnside and Couch streets. The building known then as Bay E was last used by streetcars in the early 1950s and was sold in 1954 to Bitar Brothers. It was eventually converted into an office building, and is known as the Burnside Trolley Building (with address of 2705 E. Burnside Street).

He assembled this collection in response to requests from American servicemen during World War II for a pocket-sized collection of his work to take into deployment with them. Despite the poet's inquiries and the nature of the requests that prompted him to approach them, several publishers rejected The Wedge. Their grounds for doing so were a perceived lack of literary quality and wartime shortages. The book was eventually handset printed by Henry Duncan and Wightman Williams at Cummington Press and bound surreptitiously on the premises and at the expense of one of the publishers who had previously rejected it. The book is dedicated to poet Louis Zukofsky, who helped Williams revise and rearrange the poems for publication. Williams placed into The Wedge many of the poems, written since the late 1930s, intended initially for his book-length poem Paterson. (According to editor Christopher MacGowan, the poem \\"Paterson: the Falls\\" in The Wedge lays out both the later poem's theme and its eventual format.)Williams, Collected Poems, Volume II, 456/ He wrote to poet and publisher James Laughlin in 1943, \\"Paterson is coming along—this book is a personal finger-practicing to assist me in that: but that isn't all it is.\\"As quoted in Williams, Collected Later Poems, 454. Williams' original concept for The Wedge was for it to contain several forms of writing. These would include improvisational works he wrote in the 1920s, prose and selections from his play Many Loves. Eventually, with Zukofsky's assistance, Williams narrowed the book's focus. He reduced the book's material, eliminated the prose selections but added an introduction based on an address he gave at the New York Public Library in October 1943. In the opening poems, Williams states what would become the working strategy for his long poem Paterson, which he began not long afterwards.

It operated from 1946 to 1962 with a base at Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik. Sørfly operated a fleet of three Auster Autocrats, a Republic Seabee and a Miles Gemini. For most of its history the airline provided aerial photography, target tug, air ambulance, passenger and cargo charter and sightseeing services as the baseline for its revenue. From 1948 to 1951 it also operated a scheduled service on behalf of Norwegian Air Lines from Kristiansand to Aalborg and Gothenburg, and to Stavanger. History Sørfly was founded during early 1946 by four pilots and mechanics: Einar Jaatun, Ragnar Moi, Finn Erikstad and Jonny Thorsen. The airline immediately procured two Auster Autocrats. Operations the first year they focused on sightseeing. The airline would operate out of various communities selling aerial tours of the area. A specialty was pertussis-flights to soothe the sick with a steep dive. The third Autocrat was delivered in September.Bakken: 54 Skis were mounted on one aircraft for the winter seasons. These were used for charter flights to the wilderness, mostly flying hunters to Setesdal. Other important contracts were transporting cement to Skjerka and target tug for the Royal Norwegian Air Force. The latter was a permanent contract which gave the airline an even source of revenue. The airline bought a Republic Seabee seaplane in 1947. This allowed the airline to start charter flights along the coast and access to mountain cabins during the summer.Bakken: 55 Sørfly signed a contract in 1948 to provide air ambulance flights. Sørfly bought a three-passenger Miles Gemini in 1948 and used it to operate a scheduled service from Kristiansand via Aalborg Airport in Denmark to Gothenburg Torslanda Airport. From Kristiansand the flight was extended to Stavanger Airport, Sola using the Seabee. The flights were contracted by Norwegian Air Lines (DNL), who held the concession. These were negotiated year for year, which made it financially difficult for Sørfly to invest in a larger aircraft. The contract lasted until 1951, when DNL took over the service itself. The reason was that Sørfly had not been able to fly for a month during the preceding winter due to snowfall. The airline thereafter attempted to use the closed Mandal Airport at Vestnessletta in Mandal as the basis for charter flights, but Mandal Municipal Council would not allow the reopening of the Second World War airport. The winter of 1953–54 had heavy snowfall and on 3 March 1954 the hangar roof collapsed. None of Sørfly's aircraft were damaged,Bakken: 56 although Kjevik Flyklubb's Piper Cub was. Sørfly bought this aircraft, restored it and sold it a year later.Hagby: 287 Business continued to decline and in 1956 the Seabee was sold. Soon afterwards the target tugging contract was lost as the Air Force needed faster aircraft. By the turn of the decade several of the founders had quit and the airline was gradually shut down, with operations suspended in 1962. The last employee was Jaatun, who sold the remaining four aircraft in 1962 and 1963. The Gemini was retired by its ultimate owner in 1982 and was placed on display at the Norwegian Museum of Science and Technology. Ten years later it was transferred to Sola Aviation Museum.Hagby: 57 Operations Sørfly was based at Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik in Kristiansand. It had its offices at a Luftwaffe barracks built during the German occupation and its aircraft based in a German hangar from the same period. The two main contracts were for air ambulance flights and for target tugging with the Air Force. Secondary activities included aerial photography, charter flights and cargo.

He formerly lectured in cultural criticism at Cardiff University. His writings focus on issues of gender and sexuality, medical ethics, and science. In 2005, Times Higher Education described Morland as a leading academic in the field of sex research. He has edited an edition of the journal GLQ, and co-authored Fuckology, a critical analysis of the writings and practices of John Money. With Lih-Mei Liao, Morland co-founded in 2002 Critical Sexology, a continuing interdisciplinary seminar series on gender and sexuality. His audio work includes audio editing, sound design and programming. Background Morland was born with an intersex condition and subjected to numerous surgeries in childhood. Much of his writing focuses on the impact of those interventions, in explorations of the ethics of medical intervention, but also the ethics of touch, \\"desire's reach\\" and the relationship between intersex experiences and queer theory. He has a doctorate and formerly lectured in cultural criticism and gender studies at Cardiff University in the UK. Published works Morland is widely published in journals and books, as both author and editor. Much of his writing draws upon his personal history. Several articles focus specifically on the issue of sexual sensation, and loss. In \\"II. Intimate Violations: Intersex and the Ethics of Bodily Integrity\\" (2008), he argues that intersex management through surgical interventions is an intimate violation caused by lack of sensitivity to the modification of intersex bodies. In \\"What Can Queer Theory Do for Intersex?\\" (2009), Morland contrasts queer \\"hedonic activism\\" with an experience of insensate intersex bodies to claim that \\"queerness is characterized by the sensory interrelation of pleasure and shame\\". In \\"The Injured World: Intersex and the Phenomenology of Feeling\\" (2012), Morland describes how one's \\"capacity to be affected by others\\" is disrupted by genital objectification and surgery: surgery on intersex genitals are an \\"injury to flesh\\" that injure \\"our capacity to find our feet with each other\\". Other works theorize about the meaning of intersex bodies. In ‘The Glans Opens Like a Book’: Writing and Reading the Intersexed Body\\" (2004), Morland theorizes of surgeries on infants with intersex genitalia as being a \\"crisis of signification\\" and readability. In \\"Is intersexuality real?\\"' (2010), Morland suggests that \\"intersexuals need to change what counts as the truth about sex\\", using \\"language to describe what their bodies already prove - namely, that maleness and femaleness are not monumental, discrete categories\\". Faced with assertions that intersex bodies are disgusting, he concludes, \\"Surgery on intersexuals? Oh, how disgusting\\". In \\"Intersex Treatment and the Promise of Trauma\\" (2011) he discusses the social construction of ambiguity and normality, arguing \\"that medicine has been, conversely and startlingly, traumatic by design\\". In the book chapter \\"Between Critique and Reform: Ways of Reading the Intersex Controversy\\", edited by Morgan Holmes, his essay aimed to analyse activist and clinician narratives about the medical management of intersex, focusing on the reform of medicine, in place of critique. The book has been described as \\"the \\"go to source\\" for a contemporary, international representation of intersex studies,\\"Argentinian Film XXY with guest speaker Morgan Holmes , Rainbow Health Ontario, 2013. making \\"contributions that are precise, plainly written and very illuminating... the detail is fascinating and somewhat unnerving... beautifully clear and compassionate\\" (Contemporary Sociology), and \\"an important collection\\" (Suzanne Kessler, State University of New York). In Fuckology (2014). Morland critically analyses the legacy of psychologist and sexologist John Money, including his development of gender identity as a concept, and the utilization of scientific theories about the plasticity of human nature to develop controversial but still widespread treatment protocols for the management of intersex conditions. Fuckology is co-authored with Lisa Downing and Nikki Sullivan, and published by University of Chicago Press in 2014. A chapter on \\"Gender, Genitals, and the Meaning of Being Human\\" includes material previously published as \\"Plastic Man: Intersex, Humanism and the Reimer Case\\" in 2007.

The inputs are shown along the bottom of the figure, and the stored element and counter are shown as the symbols and their heights along the black curve. The Boyer–Moore majority vote algorithm is an algorithm for finding the majority of a sequence of elements using linear time and constant space. It is named after Robert S. Boyer and J Strother Moore, who published it in 1981,. Originally published as a technical report in 1981. and is a prototypical example of a streaming algorithm. In its simplest form, the algorithm finds a majority element, if there is one: that is, an element that occurs repeatedly for more than half of the elements of the input. A version of the algorithm that makes a second pass through the data can be used to verify that the element found in the first pass really is a majority. If a second pass is not performed and there is no majority the algorithm will not detect that no majority exists. In the case that no strict majority exists, the returned element can be arbitrary; it is not guaranteed to be the element that occurs most often (the mode of the sequence). It is not possible for a streaming algorithm to find the most frequent element in less than linear space, for sequences whose number of repetitions can be small. Description The algorithm maintains in its local variables a sequence element and a counter, with the counter initially zero. It then processes the elements of the sequence, one at a time. When processing an element , if the counter is zero, the algorithm stores as its remembered sequence element and sets the counter to one. Otherwise, it compares to the stored element and either increments the counter (if they are equal) or decrements the counter (otherwise). At the end of this process, if the sequence has a majority, it will be the element stored by the algorithm. This can be expressed in pseudocode as the following steps: *Initialize an element and a counter with *For each element of the input sequence: **If , then assign and **else if , then assign **else assign *Return Even when the input sequence has no majority, the algorithm will report one of the sequence elements as its result. However, it is possible to perform a second pass over the same input sequence in order to count the number of times the reported element occurs and determine whether it is actually a majority. This second pass is needed, as it is not possible for a sublinear-space algorithm to determine whether there exists a majority element in a single pass through the input.. Analysis The amount of memory that the algorithm needs is the space for one element and one counter. In the random access model of computing usually used for the analysis of algorithms, each of these values can be stored in a machine word and the total space needed is . If an array index is needed to keep track of the algorithm's position in the input sequence, it doesn't change the overall constant space bound. The algorithm's bit complexity (the space it would need, for instance, on a Turing machine) is higher, the sum of the binary logarithms of the input length and the size of the universe from which the elements are drawn.. Both the random access model and bit complexity analyses only count the working storage of the algorithm, and not the storage for the input sequence itself. Similarly, on a random access machine the algorithm takes time (linear time) on an input sequence of items, because it performs only a constant number of operations per input item. The algorithm can also be implemented on a Turing machine in time linear in the input length ( times the number of bits per input item). Correctness If there is a majority element, the algorithm will always find it. For, supposing that the majority element is , let be a number defined at any step of the algorithm to be either the counter, if the stored element is , or the negation of the counter otherwise. Then at each step in which the algorithm encounters a value equal to , the value of will increase by one, and at each step at which it encounters a different value, the value of may either increase or decrease by one. If truly is the majority, there will be more increases than decreases, and will be positive at the end of the algorithm. But this can be true only when the final stored element is , the majority element.

Record Homestead is a historic house at 8 Bean Road in Buckfield, Maine. Built in 1843-44, it is a well-preserved local example of a late transitional Federal-Greek Revival house. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. Description and history The Record House is a traditional New England connected homestead. Its main block is a 1-1/2 story Cape style wood frame structure, with a pair of slender chimneys near the sides of the gabled roof. The main entrance is centered and slightly recessed, with flanking sidelights and a transom window above. A two-story kitchen ell, also with a side-gable roof, extends to the right side, and a connecting two-story ell extends to the rear from that section, joining the main house to the barn. The exterior trim notably includes elaborate Greek Revival pilasters at the corners of the main block and kitchen ell. The interior woodwork includes a combination of Federal and Greek Revival elements. The house was built in 1843-44 by Ezekiel Courtney Record and his wife, Mariam Irish Record, on land that had been in the Record family since Buckfield's settlement. Although their property was broken up over the years, much of their original holding was reassembled in the 1970s, and the house was given a careful restoration by the current owners who bought the property in 1977.

Beard oil is usually scented (though unscented versions are available) using a variety of natural and artificial, typically masculine, scents ranging from sweet to bitter and can be used to substitute cologne or aftershave.

N.p., n.d. Web. 1 September 2014. as these weather conditions cause the natural moisture of the beard area to wick. Hydration around this area helps prevent flaking, dandruff and skin dryness. Some brands of beard oil may contain added vitamins or nutrients such as vitamin E. This moisturization prevents general itchiness and irritation of the skin under the beard. Beard oil also works below the surface of the skin by working as a grooming tool, making the beard itself more manageable, neat and smooth. Beard oil also improves the way a beard looks by giving it a slight shine. This makes a beard look healthier as well. Chemical makeup and formulations Beard oils are manufactured with the intent to emulate the natural oils produced by the skin, known as sebum. Carrier type oils generally contain vitamins A, D and E, as well as a high concentration of linoleic acids and low concentrations of oleic acids. Natural and synthetic scents may be added to the oil in order to enhance its properties and aroma.

Beard oils sold in the United States making claims to be therapeutic must be approved by the FDA.FDA.gov \\"FDA - Aromatherapy\\" Natural beard oils are typically created with both carrier oils and essential oils, absolutes, and/or extracts. Carrier oils are oils that make up the bulk of the volume of the product and are formulated to condition the skin and beard. The most popular types of carrier oils are coconut, grape seed, jojoba, saffron and argan. They are used as a natural fragrance for the beard oils, but also may have aromatherapy benefits. Since essential oils, absolutes, and extracts are usually very strong they may cause chemical burns or skin irritation, they are commonly paired up with carrier oils in order to dilute them.

His actions in Ceylon during the 1915 riots were heavy criticised locally following the institution of martial law by Governor Sir Robert Chalmers. With martial law declared Brigadier General Malcolm ordered strict enforcement of curfews with orders to shoot any one who they deemed a rioter without a trial. It was reported that Brigadier Malcolm had ordered his troops to \\"not to waste ammunition, but to shoot through the heart any Sinhalese that may be found on the streets\\". He instituted field general courts-martials, that convicted many including Captain Henry Pedris and Edmund Hewavitarne. The later he had executed while the former died in prison. The brutal action of the British marked the beginning of the independence movement.Memorandum upon recent disturbances in Ceylon In September 1915, Malcolm was transferred to the western front as a Brigade Commander in the British Expeditionary Force unit December 1915.

It begins in a narrow, high-walled valley in the central mountains and enters the Pacific Ocean on the northwestern coast of the island, just east of Wainiha, on the western edge of Lumaha'i Beach. Unaffected by development, its pristine waters contain populations of o'opu (Stenogobius hawaiiensis) and hihiwai (shellfish) as well as the Hawaiian coot. During heavy rainfall in winter and spring, it is prone to flooding. The Lumaha'i River Bridge traverses the waterway. Geography Lumaha‘i Beach at the mouth of the river The Lumaha'i River rises in the central mountains of Kauai at an elevation of . It drains a catchment area of . After flowing through a narrow valley with cliff banks, it opens out midway along its course into a wide valley, where the banks of the river are steep. The river debouches into the Pacific Ocean on the northwestern coast of the island, just east of Wainiha, on the western edge of Lumaha'i Beach. The beach at the western end, formed at the mouth of the river, is called the Lumaha‘i Beach which is located to the northwest of Hanalei. Measuring in length, the beach has rocky features at the mouth of the Lumaha'i River, which results in treacherous \\"rip currents\\". The beach is remembered as the scenic location for a song sequence in the 1958 film South Pacific. Rock formations at the mouth of the river are of a red colour, and are known as Ka-‘alele, meaning \\"messenger\\". Even during low tides, the waves on the beach are very strong, with no reefs in the waters. A black lava formation abuts the west bank near the mouth which is named Ke-alelo-O- Pilikua, meaning \\"tongue of Pilikua\\". In the hills of the river valley there is a rock formation known to the Hawaiians as Ma’ina-kehau, which is a very large boulder resembling a man with a \\"grey body and white head\\". There is natural fall midway along the river course where there is a carved flat rock formation, said to have been brought from Wainiha by the Menehune. This rock is called Pa-na’nana’a, meaning \\"protruding dish\\"; one half of this rock is of a black colour and the other half is grey. Development Though a major waterway, it is a virgin river with no developmental activities. During heavy rainfall in winter and spring, it is prone to flooding. Because of flash floods, a warning phone has been installed at the beach as safety precaution. A bridge over the waterway is known as the Lumaha'i River Bridge. The Lumaha'i river valley once witnessed toro and rice farming by the immigrant farmers from other regions of Hawaii, China and Japan, between 1890 and 1930. But it is presently uninhabited. This is a result of more intense rice cultivation in California which put them out of business, and subsequently the valley was abandoned by the people. As of 1990, only cattle grazing occurs in the valley. Wildlife The Hawaiian coot Unaffected by development, its pristine waters contains populations of o'opu (Stenogobius hawaiiensis) and hihiwai (shellfish) and the Hawaiian coot. It is reported that wi, a fresh water shell fish species is seen on the grey colour part of the Pa-na’nana’a rock during day time whereas it appears on black colour side of the rock in the night. Hawaii's lowland wet forest in the Lumaha'i valley has more than 12 rare plants. Also found are colonies of migratory seabirds which include the Newell's shearwater and Hawaiian petrel. There are three notable species of trees at the mouth of the river and these are: the hibiscus of Maihi, the breadfruit of Weli and the pendanus of Mapuana.

Interatomic potentials are mathematical functions to calculate the potential energy of a system of atoms with given positions in space.M. P. Allen and D. J. Tildesley. Computer Simulation of Liquids.

Lesar. Introduction to Computational Materials Science. Cambridge University Press, 2013. Interatomic potentials are widely used as the physical basis of molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations in computational chemistry, computational physics and computational materials science to explain and predict materials properties. Examples of quantitative properties and qualitative phenomena that are explored with interatomic potentials include lattice parameters, surface energies, interfacial energies, adsorption, cohesion, thermal expansion, and elastic and plastic material behavior, as well as chemical reactions.N. W. Ashcroft and N. D. Mermin. Solid State Physics.Saunders College, Philadelphia, 1976.Charles Kittel. Introduction to Solid State Physics. John Wiley & Sons, New York, third edition, 1968.  Functional form  Interatomic potentials can be written as a series expansion of functional terms that depend on the position of one, two, three, etc. atoms at a time. Then the total potential of the system \\\\textstyle V_\\\\mathrm{TOT} can be written as :: V_\\\\mathrm{TOT} = \\\\sum_{i}^N V_1(\\\\vec r_i) + \\\\sum_{i,j}^N V_2(\\\\vec r_i,\\\\vec r_j) + \\\\sum_{i,j,k}^N V_3(\\\\vec r_i,\\\\vec r_j,\\\\vec r_k) + \\\\cdots Here \\\\textstyle V_1 is the one-body term, \\\\textstyle V_2 the two-body term, \\\\textstyle V_3 the three body term, \\\\textstyle N the number of atoms in the system, \\\\vec r_i the position of atom i, etc. i, j and k are indices that loop over atom positions. Note that in case the pair potential is given per atom pair, in the two-body term the potential should be multiplied by 1/2 as otherwise each bond is counted twice, and similarly the three-body term by 1/6. Alternatively, the summation of the pair term can be restricted to cases \\\\textstyle i and similarly for the three- body term \\\\textstyle i, if the potential form is such that it is symmetric with respect to exchange of the j and k indices (this may not be the case for potentials for multielemental systems). The one-body term is only meaningful if the atoms are in an external field (e.g. an electric field). In the absence of external fields, the potential V should not depend on the absolute position of atoms, but only on the relative positions. This means that the functional form can be rewritten as a function of interatomic distances \\\\textstyle r_{ij} = |\\\\vec r_i-\\\\vec r_jand angles between the bonds (vectors to neighbours) \\\\textstyle \\\\theta_{ijk}. Then, in the absence of external forces, the general form becomes :: V_\\\\mathrm{TOT} = \\\\sum_{i,j}^N V_2(r_{ij}) + \\\\sum_{i,j,k}^N V_3(r_{ij},r_{ik},\\\\theta_{ijk}) + \\\\cdots In the three-body term \\\\textstyle V_3 the interatomic distance \\\\textstyle r_{jk} is not needed since the three terms \\\\textstyle r_{ij},r_{ik},\\\\theta_{ijk} are sufficient to give the relative positions of three atoms i, j, k in three-dimensional space. Any terms of order higher than 2 are also called many-body potentials. In some interatomic potentials the many-body interactions are embedded into the terms of a pair potential (see discussion on EAM-like and bond order potentials below). In principle the sums in the expressions run over all N atoms. However, if the range of the interatomic potential is finite, i.e. the potentials \\\\textstyle V(r) \\\\equiv 0 above some cutoff distance \\\\textstyle r_\\\\mathrm{cut}, the summing can be restricted to atoms within the cutoff distance of each other. By also using a cellular method for finding the neighbours, the MD algorithm can be an O(N) algorithm. Potentials with an infinite range can be summed up efficiently by Ewald summation and its further developments.  Force calculation  The forces acting between atoms can be obtained by differentiation of the total energy with respect to atom positions. That is, to get the force on atom i one should take the three- dimensional derivative (gradient) with respect to the position of atom i: :: \\\\vec{F}_i = - abla_{\\\\vec {r}_i} V_\\\\mathrm{TOT} For two-body potentials this gradient reduces, thanks to the symmetry with respect to ij in the potential form, to straightforward differentiation with respect to the interatomic distances \\\\textstyle r_{ij}. However, for many-body potentials (three-body, four-body, etc.) the differentiation becomes considerably more complex since the potential may not be any longer symmetric with respect to ij exchange. In other words, also the energy of atoms k that are not direct neighbours of i can depend on the position \\\\textstyle \\\\vec{r}_{i} because of angular and other many-body terms, and hence contribute to the gradient \\\\textstyle abla_{\\\\vec{r}_{i}}.  Classes of interatomic potentials  Interatomic potentials come in many different varieties, with different physical motivations. Even for single well-known elements such as silicon, a wide variety of potentials quite different in functional form and motivation have been developed. The true interatomic interactions are quantum mechanical in nature, and there is no known way in which the true interactions described by the Schrödinger equation or Dirac equation for all electrons and nuclei could be cast into an analytical functional form. Hence all analytical interatomic potentials are by necessity approximations. Over time interatomic potentials have largely grown more complex and more accurate, although this is not strictly true. This has included both increased descriptions of physics, as well as added parameters. Until recently, all interatomic potentials could be described as \\"parametric\\", having been developed and optimized with a fixed number of (physical) terms and parameters. New research focuses instead on non-parametric potentials which can be systematically improvable by using complex local atomic neighbor descriptors and separate mappings to predict system properties, such that the total number of terms and parameters are flexible. These non-parameteric models can be significantly more accurate, but since they are not tied to physical forms and parameters, there are many potential issues surrounding extrapolation and uncertainties. Parametric potentials  Pair potentials  The arguably simplest widely used interatomic interaction model is the Lennard-Jones potential . :: V_\\\\mathrm{LJ}(r) = 4\\\\varepsilon \\\\left[ \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{r}\\\\right)^{12} - \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{r}\\\\right)^{6} \\\\right] where \\\\textstyle \\\\varepsilon is the depth of the potential well and \\\\textstyle \\\\sigma is the distance at which the potential crosses zero. The attractive term proportional to \\\\textstyle 1/r^6 in the potential comes from the scaling of van der Waals forces, while the \\\\textstyle 1/r^{12} repulsive term is much more approximate (conveniently the square of the attractive term). On its own, this potential is quantitatively accurate only for noble gases, but is also widely used for qualitative studies and in systems where dipole interactions are significant, particularly in chemistry force fields to describe intermolecular interactions. Another simple and widely used pair potential is the Morse potential, which consists simply of a sum of two exponentials. ::V_\\\\mathrm{M}(r) = D_e ( e^{-2a(r-r_e)}-2e^{-a(r-r_e)} ) Here \\\\textstyle D_e is the equilibrium bond energy and \\\\textstyle r_e the bond distance. The Morse potential has been applied to studies of molecular vibrations and solids , and also inspired the functional form of more accurate potentials such as the bond-order potentials. Ionic materials are often described by a sum of a short-range repulsive term, such as the Buckingham pair potential, and a long- range Coulomb potential giving the ionic interactions between the ions forming the material. The short-range term for ionic materials can also be of many- body character . Pair potentials have some inherent limitations, such as the inability to describe all 3 elastic constants of cubic metals or correctly describe both cohesive energy and vacancy formation energy. Therefore quantitative molecular dynamics simulations are carried out with various of many-body potentials. = Repulsive potentials = For very short interatomic separations, important in radiation material science, the interactions can be described quite accurately with screened Coulomb potentials which have the general form : V(r_{ij}) = { 1 \\\\over 4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0} {Z_1Z_2 e^2 \\\\over r_{ij}} \\\\varphi(r/a) Here, \\\\varphi(r) \\\\to 1 when r \\\\to 0. Z_1 and Z_2 are the charges of the interacting nuclei, and a is the so-called screening parameter. A widely used popular screening function is the \\"Universal ZBL\\" one.J. F. Ziegler, J. P. Biersack, and U. Littmark. The Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter. Pergamon, New York, 1985. and more accurate ones can be obtained from all-electron quantum chemistry calculations In binary collision approximation simulations this kind of potential can be used to describe the nuclear stopping power.  Many-body potentials  The Stillinger-Weber potential is a potential that has a two-body and three- body terms of the standard form :: V_\\\\mathrm{TOT} = \\\\sum_{i,j}^N V_2(r_{ij}) + \\\\sum_{i,j,k}^N V_3(r_{ij},r_{ik},\\\\theta_{ijk}) where the three-body term describes how the potential energy changes with bond bending. It was originally developed for pure Si, but has been extended to many other elements and compounds and also formed the basis for other Si potentials. Metals are very commonly described with what can be called \\"EAM-like\\" potentials, i.e. potentials that share the same functional form as the embedded atom model. In these potentials, the total potential energy is written ::V_\\\\mathrm{TOT} = \\\\sum_i^N F_i \\\\left(\\\\sum_{j} \\\\rho (r_{ij}) \\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{i, j}^N V_2(r_{ij}) where \\\\textstyle F_i is a so-called embedding function (not to be confused with the force \\\\textstyle \\\\vec F_i) that is a function of the sum of the so-called electron density \\\\textstyle \\\\rho (r_{ij}) . \\\\textstyle V_2 is a pair potential that usually is purely repulsive. In the original formulation the electron density function \\\\textstyle \\\\rho (r_{ij}) was obtained from true atomic electron densities, and the embedding function was motivated from density-functional theory as the energy needed to 'embed' an atom into the electron density. . However, many other potentials used for metals share the same functional form but motivate the terms differently, e.g. based on tight- binding theory or other motivations . EAM-like potentials are usually implemented as numerical tables. A collection of tables is available at the interatomic potential repository at NIST Covalently bonded materials are often described by bond order potentials, sometimes also called Tersoff-like or Brenner-like potentials. These have in general a form that resembles a pair potential: :: V_{ij}(r_{ij}) = V_\\\\mathrm{repulsive}(r_{ij}) + b_{ijk} V_\\\\mathrm{attractive}(r_{ij}) where the repulsive and attractive part are simple exponential functions similar to those in the Morse potential. However, the strength is modified by the environment of the atom i via the b_{ijk}term. If implemented without an explicit angular dependence, these potentials can be shown to be mathematically equivalent to some varieties of EAM-like potentials Thanks to this equivalence, the bond-order potential formalism has been implemented also for many metal-covalent mixed materials. EAM potentials have also been extended to describe covalent bonding by adding angular-dependent terms to the electron density function \\\\rho, in what is called the modified embedded atom method (MEAM). = Force fields = A force field is the collection of parameters to describe the physical interactions between atoms or physical units (up to ~108) using a given energy expression. The term force field characterizes the collection of parameters for a given interatomic potential (energy function) and is often used within the computational chemistry community. The force field makes the difference between good and poor models. Force fields are used for the simulation of metals, ceramics, molecules, chemistry, and biological systems, covering the entire periodic table and multiphase materials. Today's performance is among the best for solid-state materials and for biomacromolecules, whereby biomacromolecules were the primary focus of force fields from the 1970s to the early 2000s. Force fields range from relatively simple and interpretable fixed-bond models (e.g. Interface force field, CHARMM, and COMPASS) to explicitly reactive models with many adjustable fit parameters (e.g. ReaxFF) and machine learning models.  Non-parametric potentials  It should first be noted that non- parametric potentials are often referred to as \\"machine learning\\" potentials. While the descriptor/mapping forms of non-parametric models are closely related to machine learning in general and their complex nature make machine learning fitting optimizations almost necessary, differentiation is important in that parametric models can also be optimized using machine learning. Current research in interatomic potentials involves using systematically improvable, non-parameteric mathematical forms and increasingly complex machine learning methods. The total energy is then written V_\\\\mathrm{TOT} = \\\\sum_i^N E(\\\\mathbf{q}_i)where \\\\mathbf{q}_iis a mathematical representation of the atomic environment surrounding the atom i, known as the descriptor. E is a machine-learning model that provides a prediction for the energy of atom i based on the descriptor output. An accurate machine-learning potential requires both a robust descriptor and a suitable machine learning framework. The simplest descriptor is the set of interatomic distances from atom i to its neighbours, yielding a machine-learned pair potential. However, more complex many-body descriptors are needed to produce highly accurate potentials. It is also possible to use a linear combination of multiple descriptors with associated machine-learning models. Potentials have been constructed using a variety of machine-learning methods, descriptors, and mappings, including neural networks, Gaussian process regression, and linear regression. A non- parametric potential is most often trained to total energies, forces, and/or stresses obtained from quantum-level calculations, such as density functional theory, as with most modern potentials. However, the accuracy of a machine- learning potential can be converged to be comparable with the underlying quantum calculations, unlike analytical models. Hence, they are in general more accurate than traditional analytical potentials, but they are correspondingly less able to extrapolate. Further, owing to the complexity of the machine-learning model and the descriptors, they are computationally far more expensive than their analytical counterparts. Non-parametric, machine learned potentials may also be combined with parametric, analytical potentials, for example to include known physics such as the screened Coulomb repulsion, or to impose physical constraints on the predictions.  Potential fitting  Since the interatomic potentials are approximations, they by necessity all involve parameters that need to be adjusted to some reference values. In simple potentials such as the Lennard-Jones and Morse ones, the parameters are interpretable and can be set to match e.g. the equilibrium bond length and bond strength of a dimer molecule or the surface energy of a solid . Lennard-Jones potential can typically describe the lattice parameters, surface energies, and approximate mechanical properties. Many-body potentials often contain tens or even hundreds of adjustable parameters with limited interpretability and no compatibility with common interatomic potentials for bonded molecules. Such parameter sets can be fit to a larger set of experimental data, or materials properties derived from less reliable data such as from density-functional theory. For solids, a many-body potential can often describe the lattice constant of the equilibrium crystal structure, the cohesive energy, and linear elastic constants, as well as basic point defect properties of all the elements and stable compounds well, although deviations in surface energies often exceed 50%. Non-parameteric potentials in turn contain hundreds or even thousands of independent parameters to fit. For any but the simplest model forms, sophisticated optimization and machine learning methods are necessary for useful potentials. The aim of most potential functions and fitting is to make the potential transferable, i.e. that it can describe materials properties that are clearly different from those it was fitted to (for examples of potentials explicitly aiming for this, see e.g.). Key aspects here are the correct representation of chemical bonding, validation of structures and energies, as well as interpretability of all parameters. Full transferability and interpretability is reached with the Interface force field (IFF). An example of partial transferability, a review of interatomic potentials of Si describes that Stillinger-Weber and Tersoff III potentials for Si can describe several (but not all) materials properties they were not fitted to. The NIST interatomic potential repository provides a collection of fitted interatomic potentials, either as fitted parameter values or numerical tables of the potential functions.  Reliability of interatomic potentials  Classical interatomic potentials often exceed the accuracy of simplified quantum mechanical methods such as density functional theory at a million times lower computational cost. The use of interatomic potentials is recommended for the simulation of nanomaterials, biomacromolecules, and electrolytes from atoms up to millions of atoms at the 100 nm scale and beyond. As a limitation, electron densities and quantum processes at the local scale of hundreds of atoms are not included. When of interest, higher level quantum chemistry methods can be locally used. The robustness of a model at different conditions other than those used in the fitting process is often measured in terms of transferability of the potential.

Stearns, 1887. His parents, although not professionals, taught music and were prominent members of the choir in the Congregational meeting house. (The 1791 meeting house survives as the premises of the Ashburnham Historical Society, but was replaced by a new meeting house in the 1830s). His sister, Rebecca Hill Stearns, was a soprano and music teacher and married Capt. Addison A. Walker (see photo), who was known as a fine clarionet player. His brother George Henry Stearns was a musician in the Brigade Band, Twentieth Army Corps during the Civil War and was with General Sherman in his 'March to the Sea'. and showed early promise, playing the bass viol with the choir in the Ashburnham meeting house from childhood.\\"In this choir ... C.C. Stearns, when a lad, accurately played the bass viol.\\" History of Ashburnham, Massachusetts, p. 329, Ezra S. Stearns, 1887. See also Genealogy and memoirs of Isaac Stearns and his descendants, Avis Stearns Van Wagenen, 1901: \\"His musical taste and ability were manifested at an early age and his proficient execution in boyhood is pleasantly remembered by the residents of his native town, Ashburnham, Mass. He played the bass viol in the Congregational Church before his stature would permit him to reach the strings, and Mr. Miller, the chorister, made a cricket [foot stool] for him to stand upon.\\" He studied the piano and organ with Professor Benjamin F. Leavens\\"Benjamin Franklin Leavens [1822-81] early developed a musical taste, and at the age of eighteen was organist at Christ Church, Boston. He afterward went to St. Paul's Church on Tremont St., where he organized the first boy choir of Boston. In 1857 he removed to Burlington, N. J., and took charge of the music at St. Mary's and at Burlington College under the patronage of his friend, Bishop Doane, of the diocese of New Jersey. Here he remained until the death of Bishop Doane, and in 1863 he removed to Hartford, Conn. During the remainder of his life he was connected with St. John's, Trinity and other Churches, serving also as professor of music in Trinity College until 1870 — making an uninterrupted service with the Episcopal Church of over thirty years. He was an ardent admirer of a high order of Church music, and in the course of his life had collected an extensive library of Church and classical music. Besides the organ, he gave instruction on other instruments. So much time was devoted to instruction that he did not progress in composition, though possessing talent in that direction.\\" from The Leavens name including Levings; an account of the posterity descending from emigrant John Levins, 1632-1903, Philo French Leavens, Passaic N.J., 1903 and the cello with Wulf Fries, a member of the Mendelssohn Quintette Club.

The Mass setting was first sung at St Anne's Church, Worcester at Easter 1869 and was seen in manuscript before publication by, amongst others, George P.

Practical and complete guide to all musical publications (Volume 28), Franz Pazdírek (ed.), Vienna, 1900. See also Stearns, C. C. and Notated Music These were warmly received when first performed,\\"Mr. C. C. Stearns's concert and the first performance of his new Mass...took place on Thursday evening, filled Washburn Hall to its full extent, and was pronounced one of the best concerts ever given in Worcester. It opened with a Tantum Ergo, composed by Mr. Stearns, and well sung by the club under his leadership, with assistance of an efficient little orchestra of seven pieces. The work was well received, especially the second movement, which was brilliant and telling....The second part of the programme was occupied by Mr. Stearns's original Mass in A, a work noticed at length in our columns last week, and which, on the occasion of its first public performance, revealed new beauties to those who heard it in rehearsal, and won from the large audience only high encomiums of praise. Rarely does it happen that a young composer succeeds so well in bringing out his first work, in summoning such efficient aid — choral and instrumental, and in more than meeting public expectation. A more enthusiastic audience is rarely found in our concert-rooms; and yet it was not demonstrative, did not even demand an encore; but there was that unmistakeable air of cordial appreciation, more valued doubtless by composer and performers than the loudest applause. The choruses were well sung; so, too, the majority of the solos, quartets, &c.; The strong points of the work came out with new force, and the unity of the whole was even more apparent than before. The Et Incarnatus the Agnus Dei — with the Miserere breathed out, rather than sung; and the Dona Nobis, were especially admired. The orchestral parts were the subject of general remark for their originality, richness, and the sound musical knowledge shown in their composition. It is the general desire that the performance of the Mass should be repeated. We hope to hear it in Mechanics Hall, with a larger orchestra and an organ. Why not at the dedication of the fine instrument to be held here during the coming fall?\\" Dwight's Journal of Music: A Paper of Art and Literature, Volumes 23-24, 1863-65, p. 210 including at the Mechanics Hall,\\"An original Mass by a young native composer was the main attraction of a concert lately, which appears to have excited great interest.... Mechanics Hall has seldom been the scene of a more interesting musical event than on the evening of the 23d inst., the occasion of the second public performance of Mr. Stearns's Mass in A. The composer had spared no pains nor expense to give the work the best possible performance, and a large and appreciative audience, many from adjoining and even distant towns, rewarded his efforts....The chorus singers selected for the Mass had been well chosen. Every voice told, and the parts were well balanced. Moreover, the rehearsals had been frequent and faithful. Very pleasant it was to notice that each singer made the work his own for the time; and all sang as if heart and soul were with the young composer and his music — no small compliment to the innate merit of the work which could voluntarily command such interest.... The Mass bears repetition; indeed it is rich in material for study. Very fine is the working up of some of its choruses; as for instance the \\"Amen\\", with its fugue treatment, and the magnificent \\"Sanctus\\", which was rendered on Tuesday evening with thrilling effect. The \\"Et Incarnatus\\" is finely conceived, as all must have felt who heard the quartet sung the other evening by sympathetic, well-trained voices. Fragments of the \\"Gloria\\", the \\"Agnus Dei\\", and \\"Dona Nobis\\" were hummed and whistled in the streets, and drummed out of pianos for months after the first performance of the Mass, and yet these melodies are as artistic as they are original, and as far as possible removed from the clap-trap which seizes the popular ear for a time, to be soon condemned as worthless.\\" Dwight's Journal of Music: A Paper of Art and Literature, Volumes 25-26, 1865-67, p. 184.

Leland & Co., Worcester Ma., 1876; see The Parish Sexton The Parish Sexton by Cassius Clement Stearns Stearns' output was summarized in 1890 as follows: \\"Model Anthems is the title of a new work for quartets and chorus choirs, by Mr. C. C. Stearns, and although only recently published, it is already meeting with a most substantial recognition by some of the best choirs in this city, as well as those in many of the country towns. Choir masters and singers are much interested in the music, which is adapted to the wants and capacities of the most cultivated choirs, and also to those of average ability. Mr. Stearns has also recently published his Easter cantata for Sunday schools, a worthy companion to his Christmas cantata. His masses in D and F, vespers in B flat and G, two masses for children's voices, entitled, Mass of the Angel Guardian and Children's Festival Mass are standard works in Catholic churches throughout the country, and two choice vocal duets, Is Life Worth Living and Hope Abides Forever for concert or church purposes, together with a trio, Father in Heaven, have met with a cordial reception from singers who are on the lookout for something new and interesting. Mr. Stearns's profession as a teacher of the piano and organ has led him to write some available compositions for these instruments and Glad Hours and Loving Hearts' Gavotte are among the most popular piano pieces. For the organ he has written two excellent books which organ students appreciate,Organ Harmonies: A Collection of Voluntaries for Pipe or Reed Organ and Short Voluntaries for Pipe or Reed Organ (both 1887). The organist's sketch book : a new collection of pieces for pipe or reed organ was published in 1895 and Original and selected compositions for violin & organ was published in 1902. also an illustration for the organ, ContemplationContemplation ; illustration for organ, White Smith music pub. co., Boston, 1888 founded on the motto: 'An ever-pervading mystery broods over the universe and the soul of man, at times weird and solemn and again calm and reposeful, full of tender memories like a benediction of peace.' All of Mr. Stearns' compositions are published by the White, Smith Music company, of Boston, and the above named are a few of the most prominent ones.\\"Light: A Journal of Social Worcester and her Neighbors, Worcester Ma., 8 March 1890 Recent celebration of Vespers using a setting by Cassius Clement Stearns There is a pastoral quality to Stearns' music, as illustrated by the evocative bird song effects in the organ part of Beatus Vir in his Vespers in G.Sleeve notes from CD Inexplicable Splendour, The Choir of St Magnus the Martyr directed by William Petter, London, 2014 A contemporary wrote that \\"Mr. Stearns has given an apt expression of his love for his native town and a sensitive appreciation of its scenic attractions, in several musical compositions, suggested by, and dedicated to the mountains and lakes of the landscape.\\"Genealogy and memoirs of Isaac Stearns and his descendants, Avis Stearns Van Wagenen, 1901 References Category:1838 births Category:1910 deaths Category:People from Ashburnham, Massachusetts Category:Musicians from Worcester, Massachusetts Category:American male composers Category:American composers Category:Catholic music Category:Burials in Massachusetts ","title":"Cassius Clement Stearns"},{"id":"44847447","text":"Guinea Creole can refer to: *Upper Guinea Creoles (disambiguation) — Group of Creoles that include Guinea-Bissau Creole and Cape Verdean Creole *Guinea- Bissau Creole — Creole spoken in Guinea-Bissau ","title":"Guinea Creole"},{"id":"44847459","title":"1946 NCAA Cross Country Championships"},{"id":"44847460","text":"Hapoel Ironi Petah Tikva () is an Israeli women's football club from Petah Tikva competing in the Israeli First League and the Israeli Women's Cup.

Born in the desert and herself used to the rigors of the wild country, Aisan Daulat Begum was certainly the one to inculcate tenacity, self- reliance, courage to face hardships and a die hard attitude in her grandson Babur, which together became the integral feature of Babur's character and later the key to his success. Aisan Daulat Begum shared the many hardships for her husband's life for thirty years. Several times she fell into the hands of the enemy, but always came back from their clutches safely. By Aisan Daulat Begum, Yunus Khan had three daughters: Mihr Nigar Khanum, Qutlugh Nigar Khanum, and Khub Nigar Khanum. Her eldest daughter Mihr Nigar Khanum, whom Sultan Abu said Mirza took for his eldest son Sultan Ahmed Mirza. By Mirza She had neither a son nor a daughter. Her second daughter Quthlugh Nigar Khanum was married to Umar Shaikh Mirza II, the King of Ferghana Valley. She was the mother of Emperor Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire of India as well as its first Emperor. Her third daughter was Khub Nigar Khanum, who was married to Muhammad Hussain Korkan Doghlet. He had by her one son and one daughter. In Kashghar, in 1455-56, when her daughter Mihr Nigar Khanum was an infant at the breast, Aisan Daulat Begum was captured, but was returned in safety to her husband. In Tashkand in 1472-73, when Yunus Khan had gone to buy barley at a time of dearth in Moghalistan, Aisan Daulat Begum was again captured, but returned with honour to her husband. Aisan Daulat Begum shared the vicissitudes of her remarkable husband's remarkable career for some thirty years; nursed him through two years of paralytic helplessness til his death in 1487 at the age of seventy four, and survived him about eighteen years. Regent to Babur Aisan Daulat Begum contributed a lot to the making of Babur a disciplined and preserving man. She was virtually his counselor through his early struggle to hold Farghana. In 1494, when Umar Shaikh Mirza II died, Babur was an insecure boy of about of eleven years old. He found himself surrounded by enemies from his own families, who were keen on ousting him from his father's principality of Farghana. Right from that time, Aisan Daulat Begum was constantly by her grandson's side, guiding him and helping him overcome many a political crisis. In her hands lay the real administrative power and control of the state affairs and Babur always took her advice in these matters. Old officers were reshuffled and new officers were put in charge of the administration of many areas like Andijan, Aush, Akhsi and Marghinan. Towards the end of 1494 Babur faced a political crisis when Hasan- i-Yaqub planned to dethrone Babur and raise his younger brother Jahangir Mirza to the throne. Apart from the support of his father Yaqub, Hasan also had the support of some disaffected nobles like Muhammad Baqir Beg, Sultan Muhammad Duldai, etc. But his plans were soon discovered and nobles loyal to Babur like Khwaja-i-Qazi, Qasim Quchin, and Ali Dost Taghai hastened to meet Aisan Daulat Begum to inform her about these developments. Immediately Aisan Daulat Begum took action against the conspirators. Babur was sent with some trusted people from the gate house of the outer fort towards the citadel to seize Hasan-i- Yaqub and his supporters. On reaching the place they got to know that Hasan was out on a hawking excursion. Babur's men fell upon Hasan's supporters and made them captives. When Hasan learned about this, he fled to Samarkand to get the help of Sultan Mahmud Mirza. But, he changed his mind after reaching Kand- i-Badam, and decided to deliver a surprise attack on Akshi and convert it into a base for further attack on Andijan, where he could wait for the arrival for his ally Sultan Mahmud Mirza. Aisan Daulat Begum got to know of this plan too and once again she took the necessary plans to deal with it. An army was sent to deal with Hasan-i-Yaqub. Hasan-i-Yaqub came forward to meet it, but in the dark of the night a chance arrow from his own soldiers killed him. Thus, Babur was saved from the evil designs of Hasan-i-Yaqub, who had failed to understand the capabilities of Aisan Daulat Begum, the lady who was the real power behind Babur. In Andijan in 1497-98, when the town was taken from her grandson Babur by his kinsfolk. She was sent after him in safety to Khojand, and from there went on to the protection of her third daughter's home in Kashghar. At Samarkand in 1500-1, when the town was taken by Shaibam. She remained behind when Babur left the place, and rejoined him in a few months with his \\"family, heavy baggage, and a few lean and hungry followers.\\" Later years and death Aisan Daulat Begum continued to guide and support her grandson in his days as a wanderer. It was she who had related to him stories of the military exploits of Timur and Genghis Khan, and these served as his preliminary lesson in the art of warfare. About his grandmother Aisan Daulat Begum, Babur in his own words said: \\"Few among women will have been my grandmother's equal for judgement and counsel; she was very wise and farsighted and most affairs of mine were carried through under her advise.\\" News of her death reached Babur in Kabul early in June, 1505 during the forty days mourning for his mother.

In contrast to other Commodore-focused publications such as Commodore Magazine and COMPUTE!'s Gazette, The Transactor's popularity was based on its coverage of deep technical issues and hardware hacking. INFO called The Transactor \\"the undeniable authority\\" on \\"Commodore programming and hardware information\\". Publication history The magazine was launched on 30 April 1978 as the official international bulletin of Commodore Canada to PET user groups. The early issues were low-tech mimeographed productions with no non-Commodore advertising and a roughly monthly release schedule. Despite its association with Commodore, the magazine earned a reputation for being honest and upfront about bugs and faults in Commodore's products. In September 1982 the magazine was relaunched as a fully independent, bimonthly, advertiser- supported publication. From this point the magazine became professionally typeset with full-colour illustrated covers. It was sold by subscription throughout its run, and also appeared on newsstands from June 1982 until July 1987; during this period the magazine claimed a peak circulation of 72,000, of which 53,000 was newsstand sales. The independent Transactor went through a succession of publishers (Canadian Micro Distributors until April 1983, then Transactor Publishing from July 1983 to September 1988, and finally British publishing house Croftward Publishing). Though a popular magazine among Commodore users, it unexpectedly went out of business and ceased publication in August 1989. Karl Hildon served as editor-in-chief of the magazine until the March 1988 issue. Frequent contributors included Jim Butterfield and Richard Evers. Spin-offs In January 1988, The Transactor announced that it had spun off its coverage of the Commodore Amiga to a dedicated magazine, Transactor for the Amiga. At least four anthologies of Transactor articles appeared in book form: The Best of The Transactor Volume 1 through The Best of The Transactor Volume 3, plus The Transactor Book of Bits and Pieces #1. In the course of preparing Volume 2 Hildon was inspired to create a comprehensive reference work for Commodore 8-bit computers, which was eventually published as The Complete Commodore Inner Space Anthology.

Pusey (December 1, 1865 - August 29, 1940) was an American physician and past president of the American Medical Association. He advocated for the use of radiation in the treatment of skin diseases and he was an expert in the study of syphilis. Pusey authored several books, including the first history of dermatology that had been written in English. Early life Pusey was born in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. His ancestors were Quakers who traveled to the United States with William Penn. He was the son of a local physician with a successful practice. Pusey graduated from Vanderbilt University in 1885 and New York University School of Medicine in 1888. Interested in the specialty of dermatology, he went to Europe to train and practice for a while. Upon returning to the United States, he briefly took over his father's practice in Elizabethtown. He also worked as an examiner for the New York Life Insurance Company. Career In 1894, Pusey became the head of the new dermatology department at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Chicago (\\"P&S;\\"). He served in that capacity until 1915, also treating patients at Cook County Hospital. He was an early proponent of treating skin conditions with radiation. He also became an expert in the treatment of syphilis and criticized the widespread use of arsenic in the management of the condition. Pusey also wrote the first English-language history of dermatology. Pusey was a charter member of the Chicago Dermatological Society. He was also president of the American Medical Association (AMA) in 1924-25. During his term as AMA president, Pusey decried the costs associated with medical education. He criticized the fact that medical schools remained out of reach for those from poor rural backgrounds, which he said resulted in physician shortages in many rural areas. Personal life Pusey and his brother purchased a historic home in Elizabethtown, restored it and donated it to the community in the 1920s. The home became known as the Brown-Pusey House. Pusey was married to the former Sallie W. Cunningham. Later life After Pusey retired from P&S;, the school named him an honorary professor. He spent 16 years as the editor of the Archives of Dermatology and Syphilology. In 1940, Pusey died at his Chicago home. Works *Pusey, W. A., Caldwell, E. W. (1903).

The concept has no scientific basis and is widely regarded as quackery.  Background  An assumption of grape therapy is that consuming grape constituents would provide unusual therapeutic or nutritional benefits. However, consuming grapes has unknown effects against cardiovascular diseases and other diseases, such as metabolic syndrome. Alternative medicine practitioners have recommended grapes and parts of the vine for treating various diseases, but there is no clinical evidence for any such effects. Grape pomace contains various micronutrients potentially having health properties, such as B group vitamins, vitamin C, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium, as well as trace elements such as copper, iron, manganese, and zinc, but the resulting flour from pomace has variable nutrient contents due to processing, drying and storage conditions. Raw grapes are mostly devoid of nutritional benefit, except for moderate amounts of carbohydrates and vitamin K (see grape nutrition). Proanthocyanidins, anthocyanins and resveratrol extracted from grape seeds and grape skins are under basic research for their possible biological effects. Pomace also contains organic acids (tartaric, malic, citric, tannic), but there is no evidence for health effects from these phytochemicals.  History  150px The documentation of grape cures was first seen in a publication by V.N. Dmitriev called “Treatment With Grapes in Yalta on the Southern Crimean Shore” (1878). In the USSR, the principles of the grape cure were developed in the 1920s by a group of physicians of the Semashko Institute (Yalta), headed by A.V. D'iakov. Ampelotherapy continues to be offered in alternative medicine clinics and spas, particularly in Europe, together with vinotherapy, a cosmetic treatment that involves rubbing grapes into the skin. Johanna Brandt, a South African doctor, popularized the grape diet as a treatment for cancer from 1925. She published about twenty pamphlets on the subject of natural remedies for health problems with her best-known publication being The Grape Cure, which is said to have been written after Brandt had cured herself of stomach cancer by following the diet. The book was republished in 1989 as How to Conquer Cancer, Naturally, including an endorsement of Brandt’s work by Benedict Lust, who is commonly referred to as \\"the father of naturopathy\\". The book may have been inspired by Arnold Ehret, a contemporary, who taught a Grape Cure course.Sylvia Saltman, What Ever Happened To Arnold Ehret? Sylvia Saltman, USA: Vegetarian World Magazine, 1977, page 8. Starting in the late 1980s, resveratrol in red wine was suggested as an explanation for the disputed \\"French paradox,\\" the apparent low occurrence of heart disease among French people who drink red wine and consume a high-fat diet. Although commonly used as a dietary supplement and studied in human trials at amount much higher than can be consumed from drinking red wine, there is no high- quality evidence that resveratrol provides any benefits for cardiovascular risk factors. Advocates of grape therapy argue that grape phytochemicals inhibit the development of cancer, arthritis or diabetes, but there is no scientific evidence for such effects. For example, a study carried out in Chianti in Tuscany, Italy, which assessed 783 people over age 65 who consumed a resveratrol-rich diet, found no link between the diet and rates of heart disease, cancer, or mortality rate.  Treatments  The diet proposed by Johanna Brandt recommended fasting for two or three days, consuming only cold water, followed by a diet of only grapes and water for one to two weeks, with seven meals a day. Fresh fruits, tomatoes, and sour milk or cottage cheese are then introduced to the diet followed by raw vegetables.  Criticisms  Available scientific evidence does not support claims that a diet of grapes is alone effective for treating cancer or any other disease. The Brandt diet, in particular, has been described as “quackery” by Barrett who notes that the American Cancer Society reviewed The Grape Cure in 1965, 1971, 1974, and 2000 and found no evidence of benefit against human cancer or any other disease. Grape seed extract has been identified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a \\"fake cancer 'cure'\\".

It was launched by Union Health Minister J. P. Nadda on 25 December 2014. The scheme this seeks to drive towards 90% full immunisation coverage of India and sustain the same by year 2020. Vaccination is being provided against eight vaccine-preventable diseases nationally, i.e. Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Tetanus, Polio, Measles, severe form of Childhood Tuberculosis and Hepatitis B and meningitis & pneumonia caused by Haemophilus influenza type B; and against Rotavirus Diarrhea and Japanese Encephalitis in selected states and districts respectively.https://mohfw.nic.in/sites/default/files/41016395871489662752.pdf 201 districts will be covered in the first phase. Of these, 82 districts are in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh. The 201 districts selected have nearly 50% of all unvaccinated children in the country. The mission follow planning and administration like PPI (Pulse Polio immunisation). Mission Indradhanush may be regarded as one of the key schemes of the NDA government in India. PM Narendra Modi launching the Mission Intensified Indradhanush, at Vadnagar J. P. Nadda launching the Media Campaign of “Mission Indradhanush”, in New Delhi with The UNICEF Representative for India, Mr. Louis-Georges Arsenault, the Secretary History Immunisation Programme in India was introduced in 1978 as ‘Expanded Programme of Immunisation’ (EPI) by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. In 1985, the programme was modified as under National Health Mission (NHM) since 2005. Despite being operational for many years, UIP has been able to fully immunise only 65% children in the first year of their life. Goal of Mission Indradhanush Launched on 25 December 2014, this seeks to drive towards 90% full immunisation coverage of India and sustain the same by year 2020. The ultimate goal of Mission Indradhanush is to ensure full immunisation with all available vaccines for children up to two years of age and pregnant women. The Government has identified 600 high focus districts across 28 states in the country that have the highest number of partially immunised and unimmunised children. Earlier the increase in full immunisation coverage was 1% per year which has increased to 6.7% per year through the first two phases of Mission Indradhanush. Four phases of Mission Indradhanush have been conducted till August 2017 and more than 2.53 crore children and 68 lakh pregnant women have been vaccinated. It aims to immunise all children under the age of 2 years, as well as all pregnant women, against eight vaccine preventable diseases. The diseases being targeted are diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, poliomyelitis, tuberculosis, measles, meningitis and Hepatitis B. In addition to these, vaccines for Japanese encephalitis and Haemophilus influenzae type B are also being provided in selected states. In 2016, four new additions have been made namely Rubella, Japanese Encephalitis, Injectable Polio Vaccine Bivalent and Rotavirus. In 2017, Pneumonia was added to the Mission by incorporating Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine under Universal Immunisation Programme. Vaccination programme under Mission Indradhanush, at a tribal village Haripur in Badsahi Block of Mayurbhanj witnessed by Dharmendra Pradhan  Intensified Mission Indradhanush To further intensify the immunisation programme, PM Narendra Modi launched the Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI) on 8 October 2017. Through this the Government aims to reach each and every child up to two years of age and all those pregnant women who have been left uncovered under the routine immunisation programme/UIP. The focus of special drive was to improve immunisation coverage in select districts and cities to ensure full immunisation to more than 90% by December 2018 instead of 2020.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush 2.0 To boost the routine immunisation coverage in the country, the minister of Health and Family welfare Dr. Harsh Vardhan introduced Intensified Mission Indradhanush 2.0 to ensure reaching the unreached with all available vaccines and accelerate the coverage of children and pregnant women in the identified districts and blocks from December 2019-March 2020. This aims to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of ending preventable child deaths by 2030. It aims at immunising 272 districts in 27 States and at block level (652 blocks) in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar because of its hard to reach and tribal populations. Ministry of Women and Child Development, Panchayati Raj, Ministry of Urban Development, Ministry of Youth Affairs and others have come together to ensure the benefits of vaccines reach the last mile. Status In December 2014, Mission Indradhanush was launched for a targeted approach to immunisation in India, in a bid to change the tardy annual growth rate of 1 per cent. Between 2014 and 2018, India's annual immunisation growth rate has risen to 4 per cent, with an unprecedented 16 per cent rise in the number of fully immunised children. Official data on India's immunisation coverage still stands at 62 per cent as per the National Family Health Survey 4 (2015-16). However, the Union Health Ministry's internal data, presented recently at the 4th Partners’ Forum meeting in New Delhi, stands at 83 per cent, with just 2 per cent unimmunised children. Concurrent monitoring is a combination of provider reporting and supervisor surveys done within the system to estimate how a programme is working. The concurrent data for 2014 showed a full immunisation coverage of 67%, according to documents available with The Indian Express. The 83 per cent coverage figure is till November 2018. However, the target that the ministry had set for itself was to touch 90 per cent by December 2018, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched an upgraded version of the mission during the run-up to the Gujarat Assembly elections.

History Vaidyaratnam P. S. Warrier, a renowned scholar and academician in whose honour the Government of India have issued a postage stamp, founded Arya Vaidya Sala in 1902, at Kottakkal, a small town in Malappuram district, in the Indian state of Kerala, where he hailed from. It began as a small clinic for outpatient treatment and sale of ayurvedic medicines. Fifteen years later, Warrier established the Arya Vaidya Patasala (school of ayurvedic medicine), in the town of Kozhikode teaching under the Gurukula method. The school was shifted later to Kottakkal and has transformed itself into a Medical College, Vaidyaratnam P. S. Varier Ayurveda College, affiliated to the University of Calicut.

Suspect French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said that the attacker in Nantes was \\"unbalanced\\". There were initial reports that the attacker had shouted Allahu Akbar (\\"God is Great\\"), however, police stated that a notebook in his van contained \\"incoherent suicidal phrases\\", and his fear of being murdered by the secret services.

Il fauche 10 personnes au marché de Noël, 'Ouest France', 23 December 2014. After tending his wounds, he was transferred to a psychiatric hospital on 31 December. In January 2015 he was transferred to prison. He was described as a loner, an alcoholic and paranoiac, but was declared by a psychiatrist as responsible enough to be tried. He hanged himself in his isolation cell at the Nantes- Carquefou on the early morning of 13 April 2016. Nantes: L'homme qui avait foncé sur la foule lors du marché de Noël s'est suicidé en prison, F.B., 20 minutes, 13 April 2016. Motivation The Financial Times described in a July 2016 piece this attack, the 21 December 2014 Dijon attack, and the 20 December 2014 Tours police station stabbing as \\"the first ISIS-linked attacks\\" in France. According to The Globe and Mail, the attack was \\"apparently inspired by a video\\" circulated by ISIL calling on French Muslims to attack non-Muslims using vehicles. According to David C. Rapoport of the University of California, Los Angeles, these three attacks can be understood in the context of the rise of the Islamic State in Syria. \\"In September 2014, after the U.S. organized its airstrikes, the Islamic State’s chief spokesman called on Muslims in Western countries to find an infidel and ‘smash his head with a rock’, poison him, run him over with a car or ‘destroy his crops’. Two months later a video released in French contained virtually the same message, and a series of strange 'lone wolf' attacks followed on three consecutive days, the perpetrators declaring “'God is Great' in Arabic. Three policemen were stabbed in Joué-lès-Tours, and vehicles were used to run over eleven pedestrians in Dijon and ten in Nantes.\\" Reaction Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre- Henry Brandet announced an investigation into the Nantes attack, saying \\"I wouldn't say it was a terrorist attack. I would call it a deliberate act\\". François Hollande, the President of France, ordered an emergency cabinet meeting as a result of the attack in Nantes. Manuel Valls, the Prime Minister of France, aimed to reassure the French public that their concerns over the incidents would be listened to by the government.

Westmeath, Ireland. Early life and family He was the son of Jane Girardot [Mary Jane Crommelin Girardot], from a Huguenot family, and Colonel Gustavus Hamilton of Summerseat, Co. Meath, who died in 1754; Mrs.Hamilton later married Arthur Blennerhasset of Ballyseedy, Tralee, Co. Kerry and settled in Oak Park, Tralee. The year his father died, Hamilton moved from Athlone to attend the Royal School, Armagh, along with Rev. Arthur Grueber who became headmaster that year. He went to Trinity College, Dublin in 1765, developing interests in astronomy and science, and graduated with a B.A. in 1769. He married Jane Bunbury, probably sometime between 1770 and 1780 (union unrecorded). The couple had two daughters: Harriet, who was married c.1797 to Peter Holmes, and Jane, who was married in 1800 to Alexander Holmes. They also had two wards, Catherine and Juliana Tisdall. Career He was made rector of Kildress, Co. Armagh, in 1776. He set up an observatory in Cookstown, Co.Tyrone, which included an achromatic telescope, a transit instrument and clocks for solar and sidereal time. He was a member of the Royal Irish Academy (). The astronomer royal, Nevil Maskelyne, presented Hamilton's observations of the 1782 transit of Mercury to the Royal Society, as they were considered to be superior to those made at Greenwich. In February 1784, he resigned from Kildress and was rector of Dunbin for a short time before becoming treasurer of the Diocese of Armagh and rector of Creggan. The same year he gained bachelor and doctor of divinity degrees at Trinity. In the late 1780s, under the fortuitous patronage of Archbishop Richard Robinson, Anglican Primate of All Ireland, Baron Rokeby and 3rd Baronet Rokeby, he began establishing an observatory at Armagh. An equatorial transit instrument was purchased from Edward Troughton of London. He resigned the treasurership of Armagh in March 1790 and took on the prebendary of Tynan. In December, he relinquished that role for the prebendary of Mullabrack and the archdeaconry of Ross. On 31 July, he was appointed astronomer and keeper of the new Armagh Observatory and museum. The observatory was established by an act of Parliament. In this process, he was supported throughout by Maskelyne. The observatory building bears a plaque stating that Hamilton commenced the post in 1793; his first recorded observation - with a transit instrument - was on 18 July 1793. His scientific patron, Archbishop Robinson, with whom he appeared to spend much time in Bath, died in 1794, so the stream of funds for commissioning equipment for the observatory was blocked by the board of trustees. Nonetheless, a 42-inch (107 cm) focal length refractor by Dollond was acquired, a 10-foot Newtonian reflector by Herschel, outstanding clocks by Thomas Earnshaw in particular and Dublin-based John Crosthwaite, and a comparatively inferior transit instrument by local horologist James Waugh. Hamilton provided references for Earnshaw's fine work which led to the latter being awarded a share of the 'longitude prize', the principal recipient being the great John Harrison. Amid difficulties operating the equipment, and with the help of his assistants, most notably Presbyterian minister Robert Hogg, a routine of observations was established but they were regarded as reliable if not notable in astronomical circles. He made a number of entries in The Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy concerning his astronomical observations at Armagh and Greenwich and the usage of associated equipment. He successfully maintained his desire to work with other astronomers and observatories, especially Dunsink Observatory in Dublin, and to continue with Robinson's wish for a permanent scientific and educational institution in the north of Ireland, even using his own funds. In 1800 he published An Astronomical Introduction to the Study of Geography for usage in schools. In September 1804, Hamilton was appointed dean of Cloyne, his final and most senior ecclesiastical post. He remained in his post at Armagh Observatory until his death there, on 21 November 1815, aged 66. He was buried at Mullabrack.

The IMS core network along with the applicable Application Server (AS) performs the call control. ViLTE uses the H.264 codec to encode and decode the video stream. The H.264 codec delivers superior quality as compared to the low bit rate 3G-324M codec that is used in 3G conversational video calls. It is vital that ViLTE video calls are allocated appropriate quality of service (QoS) to differentiate and prioritize this delay and jitter sensitive conversational traffic from other streaming video traffic that is not as delay or jitter sensitive. The mechanism used is called QoS Class Identifier (QCI). The ViLTE bearer traffic is typically allocated QCI=2, and the SIP-based IMS signalling QCI=5.

He originally competed in hunter chases, which are confined to horses who have taken part in fox hunting, and won five of his first six races. When moved into open competition he won four consecutive races including the Badger Beer Chase, Hennessy Gold Cup, King George VI Chase and the Ascot Chase before sustaining a career-ending injury in the 1999 Cheltenham Gold Cup. Background Teeton Mill was a grey gelding bred in the United Kingdom by Mrs K I Hayward. He was sired by Neltino who won one of his five races before his racing career was ended by injury as a three- year-old in 1981. He became a successful National Hunt stallion whose other offspring included Flying Instructor (winner of fourteen races including the Red Rum Chase) and Mandy's Mantino (seven races including the Sport of Kings Challenge). Teeton Mill's dam Celtic Well was an unraced daughter of the broodmare Rydewell who also produced the Christmas Hurdle winner Ryde Again. Rydewell was a distant descendant of Ayrshire Beauty, a half-sister of The Derby winner Volodyovski. Teeton Mill was first sent into training with Caroline Bailey and was owned during his racing career by The Winning Line. Racing career 1997/1998 National Hunt season Teeton Mill made his first appearance under National Hunt rules as an eight-year-old in February 1997, when he won a hunter chase over two and a half miles at Leicester Racecourse, beating thirteen opponents at odds of 11/10. When the next hunter chase season began in early 1998 he won by more than thirty lengths at Wetherby Racecourse in February before following up in March with victories at Leicester and Newbury in March. The gelding was then moved to the stable of Venetia Williams in Herefordshire. Having been ridden in his first four races by the amateur Ben Pollock, Teeton Mill was partnered by Seamus Durack when the gelding contested a hunter chase at Cheltenham Racecourse in April 1998. He started the 4/5 favourite but after taking the lead at the third last fence and weakened to finish second, beaten twelve lengths by Double Thriller. A month later Teeton Mill was ridden by Shirley Vickery when he contested the Horse & Hound Cup Champion Hunter Chase over three and a half miles at Stratford Racecourse. He started the 5/1 third choice behind the Scottish hunter Jigtime (winner of all seven of his completed races) and the mare Grimley Gale whilst the other runners included Double Silk, a winner of eighteen hunter chases including two editions of the CGA Foxhunter Chase at the Cheltenham Festival. Teeton Mill took the lead at the eleventh fence and went clear at the final fence to win by seven lengths from Grimley Gale with a gap of more than thirty lengths back to Jigtime. Double Silk was the only one of the six other runners to complete the course. 1998/1999 National Hunt season In the 1998/1999 season, Teeton Mill moved out of hunter chases to compete against professional opposition and was ridden in all of his five races by Norman Williamson. On his seasonal debut, he carried 158 pounds in the Badger Beer Handicap Chase over three and a quarter miles at Wincanton Racecourse on 7 November and won by eight lengths from Menesonic. Three weeks later, Teeton Mill was one of sixteen horses to contest the forty-second running of the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury. Carrying 145 pounds, he started the 5/1 second favourite behind the Midlands Grand National winner Seven Towers, with the other runners including Addington Boy (Tripleprint Gold Cup), Call It A Day (Whitbread Gold Cup), Coome Hill (winner of the race in 1996), The Toiseach (Reynoldstown Novices' Chase), Fiddling The Facts (Feltham Novices' Chase) and Boss Doyle (Mildmay Novices' Chase). Williamson positioned the grey just behind the leaders before taking the lead three fences from the finish. He drew steadily clear of the field in the straight to win by fifteen lengths from Eudipe. On 26 December 1998 Teeton Mill was stepped up to Grade 1 level for the King George VI Chase over three miles at Kempton Park Racecourse in which he was matched against many of the leading steeplechasers of the time including Imperial Call, See More Business, Simply Dashing (FNB Gold Cup), Escartefigue (Martell Cup), Coome Hill, Challenger du Luc (Cathcart Challenge Cup, Murphy's Gold Cup) and Mulligan (Henry VIII Novices' Chase). Starting the 7/2 second favourite on soft ground, he raced just behind the leaders before taking the lead from Imperial Call at the fourteenth of the eighteen fences. He quickly went clear of the field and won by six lengths from Escartefigue with Imperial Call more than thirty lengths away in third and Challenger du Luc last of the four finishers. In February, Teeton Mill was dropped back in distance for the Grade 1 Ascot Chase over two and a half miles in which he was pitted against the Tingle Creek Trophy winner Direct Route, the Mildmay of Flete winner Super Coin, the Murphy's Gold Cup and December Gold Cup winner Senor El Betrutti and Challenger du Luc. Teeton Mill took the lead at the sixth fence and drew clear of the field to establish a twelve length advantage at the second last fence. He was eased down in the closing stages to win by four lengths from Senor El Betrutti with the subsequently disqualified Challenger du Luc in third place. On 18 March 1999, Teeton Mill started the 7/2 second favourite behind the Irish gelding Florida Pearl for the 72nd Cheltenham Gold Cup in a field which included Dorans Pride, See More Business, Double Thriller, Addington Boy, Simply Dashing, Escartefigue, Suny Bay and Senor El Betrutti. Teeton Mill made several jumping errors before pulling up lame before the tenth fence and was later found to have dislodged a tendon on his hock. Retirement Although Venetia William hoped to bring Teeton Mill back in the 1999/2000 season, the injuries sustained in the 1999 Gold Cup ended Teeton Mill's racing career. He served as a hack for his trainer for several years. Teeton Mill died in November 2014 at the age of twenty-five.

It also defined the term mental disorder for the first time: \\"mental illness as distinct from learning disability. The definition was “mental illness; arrest or incomplete development of mind; psychopathic disorder; and any other disorder or disability of mind”. At the time, 0.4% of the population of England were housed in asylums, receiving the standard treatments of the time.A brief history of specialist mental health services, S Lawton-Smith and A McCulloch, Mental Health Foundation, Their treatment was considered by the 1957 Percy Commission and the act resulted from its deliberations. The act was designed to make: * treatment voluntary and informal; * and where compulsory give it a proper legal framework and made as a medical decision; * and to move treatment, where possible, away from institutional care to that in the community. The Act repealed the Lunacy and Mental Treatment Acts 1890 to 1930 and the Mental Deficiency Acts 1913 to 1938. One of the changes introduced by the Act was the abolishment of the category of \\"moral imbecile\\". The category, which had been introduced in 1913, had been defined in so vague terms that it had allowed also mothers of illegitimate children, especially in case of repeated births out of wedlock, to be regarded as \\"moral imbeciles\\" and thus to be placed in an institution for defectives or to be placed under guardianship.

Each bore has the capacity for two tracks. The eastern tunnel was taken out of railway service in the 1970s but is maintained to ensure the integrity of the ground overhead, and provides road vehicle access to Holloway Bank. The tunnel is just over a third of a mile (543 metres) long. The first of the multiple tunnels was built as part of the construction of the Great Northern Railway and was opened in 1850. This section of the railway was designed by the engineer Thomas Brassey and was built by Pearce and Smith and John Jay. The name is taken from Copenhagen Fields, an open space directly above the tunnels, that was once the location of the Ambassador of Denmark's residence in the 17th century. This became a popular pleasure garden and was a public meeting area, notable for rioting there in the late 18th century.Copenhagen, Islington Hidden London, Accessed December 2014.Copenhagen Fields The Model Railway Club, Accessed December 2014.

Accessed December 2014. Market Road Gardens, an open space directly above the tunnels, are a present-day surviving remnant of the Fields. The area above the southern tunnel portal was used for a rail line going to the Caledonian Road Coal and Goods Depot (now Bunning Street) which passed along the parapet of the tunnel entrance. This was situated conveniently close to the Metropolitan Cattle Market, located on the ground above the tunnels from 1855 to 1963. Many trains carried cattle along this line on their last journey to the abattoirs there.Caledonian Road Goods Depot The LNER Encyclopedia, December 2005, Accessed December 2014 The area above the southern parapet was the setting for the final scenes of the 1955 British film comedy, The Ladykillers.The Ladykillers film locations Film Locations.com , Accessed December 2014 The original tunnel is now the middle of three parallel bores. A second tunnel to the west was built in 1877 and a third one to the east in 1886. The western bore carried up and down goods traffic, the central one was used for down passenger traffic and the eastern bore was used for up passenger traffic. Following electrification in the 1970s, the layout was remodelled. By this time both Kings Cross Goods Yard and Top Shed had closed so it was possible to remove the goods lines and simplify the layout. In the current configuration, the lines approaching the tunnel from the north are grouped into Up Fast & Slow and Down Fast & Slow. Immediately before the northern portal the Up Slow is carried over the Up & Down Fast lines by an overbridge to join the Down Slow line so the central bore now carries the Up and Down Fast lines; the western bore carries the Up and Down Slow lines. The tracks in the eastern bore were lifted and it is now used to carry cables and provide occasional road access. From Belle Isle, just south of Copenhagen Tunnel all four lines become bidirectional before passing through Gasworks Tunnel to King's Cross station.

Although the rhetoric of the programme was about improving the quality of community services the reality was mostly concerned with structural changes. Community services in England did not fit easily into the model of the NHS developed under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 and were repeatedly reorganised. When primary care trusts were established most of the free-standing community NHS trusts were dissolved and taken over by the PCTs – sometimes being divided up in the process. This left the PCTs in the position of both commissioning and providing services. The Transforming Community Services programme encouraged PCTs to divest themselves of their community services. In some areas community services were transferred to acute hospital trusts or mental health trusts. Nineteen free-standing community health trusts were established up to 2012. in some areas provision was moved to the private sector. Services in Surrey were transferred to Virgin Healthcare. According to Nigel Edwards \\"Officials gave the strong impression that they would be happy to see the entire community service workforce moved off the NHS payroll, and policy changes were put in place to assist this\\". In other areas NHS staff were encouraged to set up a community interest company in the hope that if owned by the nurses and therapists who run the services the organisations would be more imaginative and flexible. Francis Maude praised Inclusion Healthcare, a very small CIC in Leicester, at a speech in December 2014 saying the company could provide care more cheaply and simply than the NHS. He related how Inclusion had helped a homeless man with leg ulcers who was refusing to go into hospital because he could not afford to put his dog in kennels while he was thereby writing \\"a cheque for £200 or whatever it cost to have the dog vaccinated and put into kennels\\". According to Maude, the firm said \\"actually if we had still been in the NHS we could never have done that without endless process and bureaucracy and auditing and which budget does it come out of, and how do we account for it, and it would never have happened”. Proposals to move services out of the NHS were not always welcomed by patients or staff. In Gloucestershire proposals to set up a social enterprise were abandoned after a Judicial Review brought by a patient backed by a campaign involving both the public and the staff.

The first full biography of its kind, the book portrays Armstrong as a complex politician and administrator in the postbellum period who balanced the needs of opposed parties surrounding the Virginia school: its African American students, Southern white neighbors, and Northern philanthropist funders. Previous works presented Armstrong in a polarized fashion, as either a savior or handicap for freedmen. The book emphasizes Armstrong's upbringing as a missionary in Hawaii in the development of his educational philosophy. Reviewers complimented the book's balanced presentation of Armstrong, grounded use of the period's thought, and contribution to the historiography of industrial education. They felt the book lacked community and state historical context, as well as recent scholarship on Native Americans at Hampton.  Summary  Robert Francis Engs's Educating the Disfranchised and Disinherited: Samuel Chapman Armstrong and Hampton Institute, 1839–1893 is the first biography of General Samuel Chapman Armstrong, the founder of the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute. The book was published by the University of Tennessee Press in 1999. It challenges several long-standing ideas about this period: that the \\"Hampton-Tuskegee system\\" and its adherents stunted the progress of African Americans, that the Hampton Institute ideology was opposed to that of historically black and historically white colleges, and that the positions of W. E. B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington were diametrically opposed. Engs writes Armstrong as a symbol of postbellum America's conflicts over race, class, religion, and gender. Engs's Armstrong, in \\"paternal ... arrogance\\" believed that he and others of higher status could best determine how to improve the lots of those suppressed by \\"lack of opportunity and discrimination\\", such as African Americans and American Indians. This intuition, of knowing \\"what was best for the freedmen\\", was influenced by his experience in missionary work, where his parents treated the indigenous Hawaiians as misbehaving children with behavior to be corrected. The biography distills Armstrong's philosophy, demeanor, and understanding of African Americans from his experiences as a missionary, student of Williams College, and leader in the American Civil War. Engs dismisses polarized interpretations of Armstrong's legacy as either a savior or a handicap for uneducated blacks. Instead, Armstrong is portrayed as a complex man who believes both in \\"black inferiority\\" and that freedmen could improve their lives through his lessons. Armstrong was born and raised in Hawaii in the mid-1800s. His father was the Kingdom of Hawaii's (secular) minister of public instruction, whose schools practiced the \\"manual labor principle of education\\". Engs wrote that Armstrong's Hawaiian childhood insulated him from racist sentiment on the mainland. Armstrong attended private schools in Oahu before moving to study on the mainland. He shied away from the ministry, believing as his father, \\"the shorter one's creed, the better\\". Armstrong's experience in the Civil War—including as a prisoner of war, leader of the United States Colored Troops, and General—led to his lifelong pursuit of \\"noble strife\\" in helping his \\"fellow man\\". He joined the Freedmen's Bureau and served as the first principal of the Hampton Institute on the Virginia Peninsula. Hampton's task was to prepare African Americans \\"to teach their people the 'civilizing' ways of white men\\" through \\"Christian teachings, a strict code of conduct, and manual labor\\". Hampton was one of eight American Missionary Association teacher-training schools. Armstrong left a 25-year legacy, and introduced the school's manual and industrial teaching methods in the late 1860s despite its increased cost. Engs distinguishes this vision from the post-1900 industrial education, with Armstrong's \\"industry\\" signifying the industriousness of \\"self-discipline and self-reliance\\". The labor proceeds also supported the black students through school, though only during school months. Armstrong sought to see his \\"best\\" graduates ascend to higher education and to occupations \\"originally envisioned for whites\\". As his \\"most famous student\\", \\"virtual son\\", and \\"spiritual heir\\", Booker T. Washington opened the Tuskegee Institute in the style of Hampton. Armstrong later expanded Hampton's scope to include Native Americans, who were kept apart from the blacks as a \\"school within a school\\". Engs notes that missionaries struggled to reconcile the task of assimilating discriminated peoples into a society that defined itself by that active discrimination. Engs portrays Armstrong as a natural politician, administrator, and \\"risk-taker\\" who sought broad-based support from opposed parties, including African Americans, the \\"anti-Negro white South\\", and white philanthropists of the North, which made Armstrong into a \\"master prevaricator\\". As a \\"realist\\", Armstrong adopted the subtleties of his patrons to keep Hampton open, and did not confuse \\"the uplift of African Americans\\" with \\"promoting their equality with whites\\". Hampton's curriculum was ultimately set by federal and donor money. In time, Armstrong's goals for the school were derailed by increased costs and the school's Northern industrialist backers, who made manual labor education the focus and end of the curriculum, rather than a means. Engs concludes that Armstrong's black graduates lived in better circumstances than their peers. Many became teachers in the South and were \\"grateful\\" for their opportunities. Reversely, Hampton's Native American graduates suffered in health at the school and had little job opportunity back out West. Engs also concluded that Armstrong's work was limited by his reliance on the elite, emphasis on white men deciding black lives, and inability to change his philosophy when his assumptions became outdated. Still, Engs thought that Armstrong succeeded in his intent to \\"civilize\\" students at Hampton, though this mattered little, Engs wrote, when white society was unprepared to accept them \\"no matter how civilized they might be\\".  Reception  Wilbert Ahern (Journal of American History) found the book's arguments convincing and \\"gracefully written\\", but wanted to know more about Armstrong's background in financial administration, forming of ties with the Northern philanthropists, and successful students apart from Booker T. Washington. Jennings Wagoner (History of Education Quarterly) noted that Armstrong's intentions were portrayed as comparable to the leaders of George Fredrickson's Inner Civil War, who saw their work as an extension of that of the Founding Fathers. Wagoner wrote that Engs provided a \\"well-grounded\\" biography that handles Armstrong's \\"complexities and contradictions\\" with skillful use of the historiography and understanding of the era. Ahern emphasized the biography's \\"balance\\" in contrast to prior partisan writing on Armstrong. He noted Donald Spivey's Schooling for the New Slavery and Engs's first book, the 1979 Freedmen's First Generation, as examples of work that associates Armstrong with \\"stifling ... African-American aspirations\\". Ahern also wrote that Engs's work affirms the then-controversial claim in James McPherson's 1975 The Abolitionist Legacy that Armstrong was \\"fundamentally dedicated to the advancement of opportunity for African Americans\\" and other races. Edna Green Medford (The North Carolina Historical Review) wrote that the book was particularly valuable to the historiography of industrial education. Medford praised Engs's contextualization of the late-nineteenth century in American political, racial, and educational thought, but criticized his treatment of the relationship between the school and its community, particularly in stories of its students interacting with the community. Ahern felt that Engs missed relevant, recent literature on Armstrong's impact on Native Americans. Harold Forsythe (The Journal of Southern History) described Engs's tone as mild, but with a \\"continuous ... critical bite\\". Forsythe also marked the book's reliance on Armstrong's and Hampton records and consequent distance from the larger history of Virginia.

The website was founded in April 2014 by Ezra Klein, Matt Yglesias, and Melissa Bell, and is noted for its concept of explanatory journalism. Vox's media presence also includes a YouTube channel, several podcasts, and a show presented on Netflix. Vox has been described as left-of-center and progressive.  History  Prior to founding Vox, Ezra Klein worked for The Washington Post as the head of Wonkblog, a public policy blog. When Klein attempted to launch a new site using funding from the newspaper's editors, his proposal was turned down and Klein subsequently left The Washington Post for a position with Vox Media, another communications company, in January 2014. The New York Times described Vox Media as \\"a technology company that produces media\\" rather than its inverse, associated with \\"Old Media\\". From his new position, Klein worked towards the establishing of Vox, including hiring new journalists for the site. Klein expected to \\"improve the technology of news\\" and build an online platform better equipped for making news understandable. The new site's 20-person staff was chosen for their expertise in topic areas and included Slate Matthew Yglesias, Melissa Bell, and Klein's colleagues from The Washington Post.Vox.com is going to be a great test of Ezra Klein's critique of journalism, Columbia Journalism Review (April 7, 2014). Vox was launched on April 6, 2014 with Klein serving as editor-in-chief. Klein's opening editorial essay, \\"How politics makes us stupid\\", explained his distress about political polarization in the context of Yale Law School professor Dan Kahan's theories on how people protect themselves from information that conflicts with their core beliefs. In June 2016, Vox suspended contributor Emmett Rensin for a series of tweets calling for anti-Trump riots, including one on June 3, 2016, that urged, \\"If Trump comes to your town, start a riot.\\" The tweets drew attention after violent anti-Trump protests took place in San Jose, California on the day of Rensin's tweet. Elizabeth Plank was hired in 2016 as a political correspondent, and in 2017 launched her own series with Vox Media, called Divided States of Women. In September 2017, Klein published a post on Vox announcing that he was taking on a new role as editor-at-large, and that Lauren Williams, who joined Vox a few months after its founding, was the new editor-in-chief.  Content  According to Vox founding editors, the site seeks to explain news by providing additional contextual information not usually found in traditional news sources. To reuse work from authors prior to the relaunch in 2014, Vox creates \\"card stacks\\" in bright canary yellow that provide context and define terms within an article. The cards are perpetually maintained as a form of \\"wiki page written by one person with a little attitude\\". As an example, a card about the term \\"insurance exchange\\" may be reused on stories about the Affordable Care Act. Vox uses Vox Media's Chorus content management system, which enables journalists to easily create articles with complex visual effects and transitions, such as photos that change as the reader scrolls. Vox Media's properties target educated households with six- figure incomes and a head of house less than 35 years old.  Video  Vox has a YouTube channel by the same name where they have regularly posted videos on news and informational subjects since 2014. These videos are accompanied by an article on their website. The themes covered in the videos are usually similar to the themes covered in the regular, written articles on the website. The channel has over 8.63 million subscribers and over 2.1 billion views . Content surrounds both current affairs, timeline of certain events, and interesting facts. In May 2018, Vox partnered with Netflix to release a weekly TV show called Explained.  Podcasts  Zack Beauchamp interviewing Michael Bennet for the Worldly podcast in 2019. Vox distributes eight podcasts, all hosted by Vox staff: * The Weeds is a twice-weekly roundtable podcast, hosted by Klein, Yglesias, healthcare-policy correspondent Sarah Kliff, immigration correspondent Dara Lind, and senior politics reporter Jane Coaston focusing on U.S. national news with a focus on the fine details of public policy. * The Ezra Klein Show is a twice-weekly interview podcast in which Klein interviews guests in politics and media. * I Think You're Interesting is a weekly interview podcast about the arts, entertainment, and pop culture, hosted by Voxs \\"critic at large\\" Emily VanDerWerff. * Worldly is a weekly roundtable podcast focusing on U.S. foreign policy and international affairs, hosted by Vox foreign-and-security-policy writers Jennifer Williams, Zach Beauchamp, and Alex Ward; Yochi Dreazen also previously hosted. * The Impact is a weekly narrative podcast hosted by Kliff investigating the effects of policy decisions in practice. * Today, Explained is a daily podcast, hosted by Sean Ramaswaram, providing short explanations of items in the news. * Future Perfect is a weekly podcast, hosted by Dylan Matthews, exploring provocative ideas with the potential to radically improve the world, often discussing ideas associated with effective altruism. * Primetime is a short-run podcast hosted by Emily VanDerWerff. Season 1 (six episodes) focused on TV's relationship with the presidency and was released on a weekly schedule.  Reception  In March 2014, before it had officially launched, Vox was criticized by conservative media commentators, including Erick Erickson, for a video it had published arguing the U.S. public debt \\"isn't a problem right now\\". The website's launch received significant media attention. Websites noted that the launch came around the same time as other data and explainer websites like FiveThirtyEight and the New York Times The Upshot. Vox was described as using clickbait-style headlines to enhance shareability and to act as a \\"Wikipedia for ongoing news stories\\". Shortly after it launched, conservative writer David Harsanyi criticized the site's concept of \\"explanatory journalism\\" in an article in The Federalist titled \\"How Vox makes us stupid\\", arguing that the website selectively chose facts, and that \\"explanatory journalism\\" inherently leaves out opposing viewpoints and different perspectives. Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry at The Week argued that the website produced \\"partisan commentary in question-and-answer disguise\\" and criticized the site for having a \\"starting lineup [that] was mostly made up of ideological liberals\\". The Weeks Ryu Spaeth described the site's operations as: \\"It essentially takes the news (in other words, what is happening in the world at any given moment in time) and frames it in a way that appeals to its young, liberal audience.\\" The Economist, commenting on Klein's launching essay \\"How politics makes us stupid\\", said the website was \\"bright and promising\\" and site's premise of \\"more, better, and more lucidly presented information\\" was \\"profoundly honourable\\", and positively compared the site's mission to John Keats's negative capability. In December 2014, the website Deadspin wrote a post listing each time Vox ran a correction for a factual error in an article. In an opinion piece in The Washington Times, Christopher J. Harper criticized the site for numerous reporting mistakes. The New York Times David Carr associated Klein's exit for Vox with other \\"big-name journalists\\" leaving newspapers for digital start-ups, such as Walter Mossberg and Kara Swisher (of Recode, which was later acquired by and integrated into Vox), David Pogue, and Nate Silver. In 2015, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry presented Julia Belluz the Robert B. Balles Prize for Critical Thinking for her work on Vox.  Accolades  Original programming by Vox has been recognized by the News & Documentary Emmy Awards, which are presented by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. In 2017, the documentary 2016 Olympics: What Rio Doesn't Want the World to See was nominated in the \\"Outstanding News Special\\" category, Vox Pop was nominated in the \\"Outstanding Arts, Culture and Entertainment Report\\" and \\"Outstanding Graphic Design and Art Direction\\" categories, and The Secret Life of Muslims was nominated in the \\"Outstanding Short Documentary\\" category. In 2018, Borders was nominated in the \\"Outstanding Video Journalism: News\\" category, and Earworm received nominations in the \\"Outstanding Graphic Design and Art Direction\\" and \\"Outstanding New Approaches: Arts, Lifestyle and Culture\\" categories.  Readership  Vox received 8.2 million unique visitors in July 2014. In August 2019 readership was estimated to be 33.4 million visitors. In a 2017 interview on Nieman Lab, Klein stated: \\"We watch our audience data pretty closely, and our audience data does not show or suggest to us that we are overwhelmingly read on one side or the other of the political sphere, which is good...And overall our audience leans a bit left, but it doesn't lean overwhelmingly so.\\"  See also   *  References   External links  * Category:2014 establishments in the United States Category:American news websites Category:Internet properties established in 2014 Category:Progressivism in the United States Category:Vox Media ","title":"Vox (website)"},{"id":"44848549","text":"The Saleslady is a 1916 American drama silent film directed by Frederick A.

It is one of Montana's largest theatres. Located in historic downtown Helena, the community theatre presents several plays, musicals, and youth extravaganzas each year. Founded in 1975, \\"GST\\" remains a cornerstone for entertainment and education in Montana's capital city. GST's Summer Conservatory combines education with a full-scale summer stock experience. Grandstreet Theatre School offers year- round classes, and has produced a surprisingly large number of theatre professionals across the country. Grandstreet Theatre current staff includes Managing Director Kal Poole, Artistic Director Jeff Downing and Director of Education Marianne Adams. History Carl Darchuck, a Montana native, returned to Helena at the invitation of John Wheeler in May, 1975 to investigate the potential for starting a community theater in Helena, much as he did in Fort Peck, Montana, Tacoma and Port Townsend, Washington. For a year, the theatre was located on Grand Street and Last Chance Gulch, in the ballroom of the historic Placer Hotel. In August, 1976, Grand Street Theatre (still three words then) was invited to move into its current space, a beautiful stone building designed originally as Unitarian church and serving as the Helena Public Library from 1933 until 1976. Since the move, the original avenue of Grand Street was demolished, and Grandstreet became one word. The Theatre has flourished under the guidance of several skilled directors, notably Don McLaughlin, who served for fourteen years, leaving in August, 1993. Later Artistic Directors include Jerry Morrison, Blair Bybee, and Stephen Alexander. Grandstreet Theatre produces seven to ten productions a year, including comedies, dramas and musicals - all the best titles. During the McLaughlin years, Don's wife Janet, began the Grandstreet Theatre School. Now run by Marianne Adams, Theatre School offers school-year classes of a wide variety, and the celebrated Summer Theatre School. Adams also coordinated the Summer Conservatory, bringing burgeoning artists from across the country to the picturesque locale for rousing Summer Stock. Grandstreet's historic building, beautiful setting and excellent plays is a must during any visit to Montana's \\"Queen City,\\" Helena. Building Built as a Unitarian Church in 1901, the facility included the sloping floor and the proscenium stage area of today. Even then, early church documents indicated it was intended as a multi- use facility. The Reverend Leslie Willis Sprague idea for the building: \\"...nor do I believe God wants churches that are too holy for usefulness in any cause, even for the entertainment and pastime of His children....\\" In 1933, an earthquake destroyed Helena's main public library. The church was donated to the City of Helena in memory of Ellen Dean for use as an interim library following the near destruction of the original facility by earthquakes. Renovations were made to the building by leveling the house floor and adding a mezzanine. In 1976, Grand Street Theatre (dba Broadwater Productions) assumed occupancy and transformed the building into Helena's full-time, year-round community theater. Its former elegance was restored thanks to a Historic Preservation Award in May, 1996. Carl Darchuck oversaw such projects as restoring the original sloped audience floor, the removal of the temporary mezzanine, putting back in the balcony, and protecting its priceless 1910 Tiffany window. The final piece of restoration came with the discovery of the 1901 blueprints of the spectacular stained glass frieze. Under the direction of Tom Cordingley, it was pain-stakingly reproduced, with the addition of the comedy and tragedy theatre masks.

History  MOTRA Maschinenbau was founded in 1946 in Nagold by Wolfgang Schlegel, an amateur pilot and constructor. At first, the company manufactured different components for the automotive and mechanical engineering industries in Germany. In 1950 MOTRA renamed the company to MOTA Maschinenbau GmbH and also enlarged the production of components: motorcycle engines, mopeds, lightweight motorcycles and vices were established. In 1954 there was a merger of the companies MOTA Maschinenbau GmbH and EUGEN METZGER to become METZGER & SCHLEGEL KG to produce bicycle frames, mopeds, lightweight motorcycles and vices. The merged company moved from Nagold to Fellbach near Stuttgarthttp://mo-ped.se/werke/metzger.htm where they tried to sell their engines to other companies and motorcycle producers. After another change of name in 1959 from Metzger & Schlegel KG to SCHLEGEL KG, the company relocated to Öhringen near Heilbronn and stopped motorcycle production at the same time. In 1979 there was a hiving off of the SCHLEGEL vice production and founding of new company DURBAL GmbH & Co.

It presented photographs by Diane Arbus, Lee Friedlander and Garry Winogrand and is said to have \\"represented a shift in emphasis\\" and \\"identified a new direction in photography: pictures that seemed to have a casual, snapshot-like look and subject matter so apparently ordinary that it was hard to categorize\\". Details The work in the exhibition, \\"documentary photography, but not as it was then known or understood\\", was \\"considered radical at the time\\" and \\"out of step with the times\\". Critics, such as Jacob Deschin writing in The New York Times, were sceptical. Neither Arbus, Friedlander nor Winogrand \\"was well known at the time but all of them came to be considered among the leading talents of their generation\\" and \\"considered among the most decisive for the generations of photographers that followed them.\\" Robert Frank's influential book of photographs, The Americans, was published in 1958. In the wall text for New Documents, John Szarkowski \\"suggested that until then the aim of documentary photography had been to show what was wrong with the world, as a way to generate interest in rectifying it. But this show signaled a change. 'In the past decade a new generation of photographers has directed the documentary approach toward more personal ends,' he wrote. 'Their aim has been not to reform life, but to know it.'\\" The photographs of Friedlander and Winogrand were closer to each other than the work of Arbus was to either of them. Szarkowski explained that what \\"unites these three photographers is not style or sensibility; each has a distinct and personal sense of the use of photography and the meanings of the world. What is held in common is the belief that the world is worth looking at, and the courage to look at it without theorizing.\\" This was \\"photography that emphasized the pathos and conflicts of modern life presented without editorializing or sentimentalizing but with a critical, observant eye.\\" New Documents comprised 94 black-and- white photographs (32 by Arbus, 30 by Friedlander and 32 by Winogrand) shot using 35 mm hand-held film cameras. A carousel tray of 80 35 mm colour slides by Winogrand was also included at venues other than MoMA where it was removed because of technical difficulties. The exhibition was shown at Museum of Modern Art, New York from 28 February until 7 May 1967 and then toured to Goucher College, Townson, Maryland; McMaster University, Connecticut; State University of New York, Buffalo; Cornell University, Ithaca, New York; Long Island University, Brooklyn; Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire; Concordia College, River Forest, Illinois; Wittenburg University, Springfield, Ohio; University of Missouri, Columbia; Krannert Art Museum, University of Illinois, Champaign; Amherst College, Massachusetts; Wesleyan University, Middleton, Connecticut; University of Notre Dame, Indiana; and San Francisco Museum of Art, San Francisco.

He subsequently defected to the Popular Unity in August 2015. Academic career In 1982, Lapavitsas obtained a master's degree at the London School of Economics, followed in 1986 by a PhD at Birkbeck College, University of London. Since 1999, he has taught Economics at the School of Oriental and African Studies, first as a lecturer and since 2008 as a professor. Political career Lapavitsas is known for his criticism of the modern Western financial system, particularly the Greek government-debt crisis, the European debt crisis and the European Union. He is also a columnist for the British newspaper The Guardian. In 2007, he founded Research on Money and Finance (RMF), an international network of political economists focusing on money, finance and the evolution of contemporary capitalism. As early as 2011, Lapavitsas, together with some other Greek economists, has been highly eurosceptic, advocating for Greece abandoning the euro and returning to its former national currency (the drachma) as a response to the Greek government-debt crisis. On 2 March 2015, Lapavitsas wrote in The Guardian that releasing Greek people from austerity and simultaneously avoiding a major falling-out with the eurozone is an impossible task for the new government of Greece. In July 2015, Lapavitsas endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election, saying: \\"If he succeeds - and I hope he does - he's exactly what Britain could do with, what the Labour Party could do with. I think that would be a very important move for the rest of Europe and for Greece. It would give a boost to the kind of thinking that would be necessary in the rest of Europe that is so sadly lacking at the moment. It would be the best thing to come out of Britain for Europe in a long time\\".

Three were completed but only one flew, development ending when SNCAC was closed. Design and development The design of the Abeille was directed by René Dorand at the helicopter division of SNCAC. An intermeshing rotor layout was chosen instead of a tail rotor design, following the examples of the 1939 Flettner Fl 265 and the Kellet XR-8 of 1944. Its twin, two blade rotors were driven by shafts which leaned out of the fuselage side-by-side. The rotor blades, which began some way from the hub, tapered strongly. Pitch and roll were adjusted from the control column by altering cyclic pitch via a pair of swashplates and yaw by changing the relative collective pitch of the two rotors with the pedals. Forward tilt of the rotor shafts was automatically linked to forward speed. A single lever controlled both the collective pitch and the throttle through an electrical link. The Abeille was powered by a Renault 12S, an inverted, air-cooled V-12 engine. The Abeille had a pod and boom, all-metal fuselage. The nose was fully glazed with two side by side crew seats ahead of a cabin with a bench seat for three passengers. The engine and gearboxes were behind them. Aft, a high mounted boom carried the empennage, which on the first prototype consisted of a tall T-tail with a narrow fin. On the second machine the tailplane was lowered to the top of the fuselage and had a pair of fins at its extremities, each roughly elliptical and mounted from its top. The tails was wooden, with fabric covered. The Abeille's fixed main landing gear had two wheels on a single axle positioned a little behind the rotor shafts and mounted on broad, single struts to the mid-upper fuselage, together with a smaller nose wheel. Three examples of the Abeille were built. The first was destroyed by fire before it had flown. The second made its first flight on 28 June 1949, piloted by Claude Dellys. SNCAC was closed in that month, its assets distributed between three remaining state owned firms and as a result the Abeille programme was abandoned; the second machine did not fly again and the third never flew.

The Celebration began operating for Carnival on 14 March 1987. She remained in the fleet for over 20 years until she was retired from the Carnival fleet in April 2008. After leaving the fleet, Celebration underwent an extensive refit and re-entered service with Carnival's subsidiary Iberocruceros as the Grand Celebration in the summer. The refit included new hull artwork and updated interiors. In May 2014, it was announced that the ship would be renamed Costa Celebration and transferred to Costa Cruises in November 2014. After the Iberocruceros brand was discontinued, the ship underwent refurbishment and was renamed the Costa Celebration. On 21 November 2014, on the day before the ship was scheduled to depart on her inaugural voyage, it was announced that the vessel had been sold to an unnamed buyer. The next day, the Costa Celebration was removed from Costa's fleet and all bookings were cancelled. Passengers who had booked on Costa Celebration's future cruises were either refunded or rebooked on other ships. On 23 December 2014, it was revealed that the ship had been purchased by the newly formed Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line, who would reuse the name Grand Celebration and sail out of the Port of Palm Beach in Riviera Beach, Florida starting in February 2015.

During arrival, it was noticed that her Costa Celebration name was painted over with the Grand Celebration name, but the funnel retained the Costa livery. The Grand Celebration was scheduled to depart for her inaugural cruise on 1 February 2015, however, due to technical difficulties, the voyage was cancelled.

Internal Revenue Service, No. 1:14-cv-01982, was filed in U.S. District Court, District of Columbia when Microsoft sued the Internal Revenue Service requesting the IRS comply with a Freedom of Information Act request. According to Microsoft the IRS \\"unlawfully withheld\\" information on a contract between law firm Quinn Emmanuel Urqhart and Sullivan and the IRS. The IRS uses the services of the law firm to assess transfer pricing financial audits of Microsoft. Background The IRS had been investigating Microsoft Corporation since 2007. Auditors have been looking at records for tax years 2004 to 2006, trying to determine if Microsoft transferred some software rights to its international subsidiaries in an effort to evade paying tax to the United States. Microsoft had filed the Freedom of Information request on September 22, 2014. When the IRS did not reply within the 20-days required by law, Microsoft sent the IRS a letter. The IRS responded by saying it needed an extension, but after the time elapsed did not provide the information. The contract between the IRS and Quinn Emmanuel was signed May 19, 2014, with a completion date of December 31, 2016, and a payment obligation of $2,185,500, according to a website maintained by the Office of Management and Budget. The law firm was retained by the IRS to help it examine the Corporate federal tax returns filed by Microsoft between 2004-2009. The service to be supplied by Quinn Emanuel was categorized as \\"Support-Professional: Expert Witness\\". Quinn Emanuel will work closely with the IRS examination team during the audit phase and is tasked with reviewing all \\"the key documents …and all relevant legal authorities to build a thorough understanding of the factual and legal issues and the record to date.\\" The transfer pricing issues that the audit may involve include a cost sharing agreement (CSA) with respect to the sufficiency of buy-in payments by an offshore affiliate of Microsoft's in exchange for licensing intangibles. History On September 10, 2014 ZDNet reported that Microsoft was held in contempt of court after refusing to hand over foreign data. On December 24, 2014, the Seattle Times reported that the IRS sued former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, Craig Mundie, Jeff Raikes, Jim Allchin, Orlando Ayala and David Guenther in an effort to compel them to testify in Microsoft's corporate tax audit. The IRS has been looking into how Microsoft and other companies deal with transfer pricing. See also * Microsoft Corporation v.

It began the process of merging with the all-female Bee Club in August 2017, and the Delphic & Bee became one of fifteen Harvard-recognized social organizations in September 2018.https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/9/8/15-groups- recognized/ History The club was founded in 1846 as an all-male chapter of the Delta Phi fraternity, known as the \\"Alpha of Massachusetts.\\" Twenty members were elected during the Chapter's two years of life. Then faculty forced it to disband. In 1885, the Grand Council of the Delta Phi fraternity decided to re-establish a fraternity at Harvard known as the Zeta Chapter, which evolved into the current club. The membership voted to become a Final Club in 1900 and in 1902 severed ties with the national fraternity to which it had maintained only loose ties. A famous, possibly apocryphal, story has it that J.P. Morgan, Jr., class of 1889, joined The Gas when he didn't get into his club of choice. According to The Harvard Crimson, he then financed the creation of his own club, the Delphic, from the fraternity.\\"The Men's Final Clubs\\" James K. McCauley The Harvard Crimson October 5, 2010 The club was initially located at 52 and 59 Brattle St. before moving to 72 Mt. Auburn St. where it was housed from 1887 to 1903. In the 1890s it \\"was officially called the Delta Phi, or more familiarly \\"The Gashouse\\", because all its windows would be lighted at once by the electricity that was then a novelty; so that it was called \\"The Gashouse\\" because of the absence of gas.\\" George Santayana, Persons and Places, Fragments of Autobiography, ed. William G. Holzberger, et al, (Cambridge, MIT Press, 1986) The current home of the club is at 9 Linden St., steps from Harvard Yard and a few blocks from Harvard Square. It was designed by James Purdon H'1895 in the neo-Georgian style and occupied in 1902-03. The design features the red brick and cornices typical of Harvard Yard. The interior contains numerous large common spaces and an oversize formal dining room on the 2nd floor for large events, no living quarters, and a regulation squash court.1925 Delphic Blue Blook, Reminiscences of Haven Parker '22 In the basement is a panelled living room for entertaining visitors. In August 2017, the Bee Club moved into the house at 9 Linden St. as well.https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/8/30/delphic-bee-union/ The Delphic is officially recognized by Harvard University. However, it was not officially affiliated with the university or recognized between 1984 and 2018. Ties with Harvard were severed in 1984 as a consequence of the Title IX provision of the U.S. Education Amendments of 1972, which would have required the club to admit female members. \\"Clubs at Harvard Vote to End Ties\\" The New York Times; December 11, 1984 In September 2018, Harvard announced that it would recognize the Delphic-Bee Merged Group as a gender-inclusive club, thereby exempting the club from the College's sanctions on members of single- gender social organizations.https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/9/8/15-groups- recognized/ The Delphic is governed by a Trust with a Board of Directors composed of alumni.  Merger With The Bee  In August 2017 the Delphic and the all-female Bee Club agreed to share premises as a precursor to an eventual merger. \\"Bee and Delphic to Share membership, Clubhouse\\" by Hannah Natanson, The Harvard Crimson; August 30, 2017 In September 2018, Harvard College announced that it would recognize the Delphic-Bee Merged Group as a single gender-inclusive social organization. As a result, members of the Delphic & Bee are not subject to the College's sanctions policy.https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/9/8/15-groups-recognized/ The Bee Club was Harvard's oldest all-female final club, founded in 1991.https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/5/22/bee-is-born-1992/  Name  The club was founded as the Zeta Chapter of the Delta Phi fraternity. With the opening of the new clubhouse in 1903, after the break from Delta Phi, the undergraduates began calling the club \\"The Gas,\\" after the club's nickname. This was adopted as the official name in 1908 but soon thereafter was changed to \\"The Delphic Club\\" presumably after cooler heads prevailed. The name of the club is a portmanteau of \\"Delta Phi Club\\".  Insignia and Emblems  The club's emblem is three torches on a blue field. The slogan for the club is \\"Three times three, long life to thee.\\" The club's tie(s) consist of the \\"Three Torches\\" logo on a dark navy field, while the club's \\"summer\\" tie is blue and white stripes on the diagonal. The club's traditions include formal, black tie dinners with alumni and undergraduates and a ban on non-members in the club. The club recruits members through a series of invited dinners and formal dances in a process known as \\"Punch.\\"  Renovations  The clubhouse was renovated in 1974-75, which included the walls, interiors and roofs to deal with leaks and general conditions. A more comprehensive renovation was undertaken in 2013-14, it included updating the club's plumbing and electrical systems and also revealed pooled water beneath the club's floor and back yard occasioned by the destruction of the club's drainage system during the construction of Farkas Hall (aka the Hasty Pudding Clubhouse). This has resulted in litigation between the Delphic Club and Harvard University. \\"Delphic Trust Files Lawsuit Against Harvard Administration\\" by Antonio Coppola and John P. Finnegan, The Harvard Crimson; October 28, 2013  In Literature  Tales of \\"The Gas House\\" are recounted by several authors including Delphic alum Charles Macomb Flandrau (1895) who tells many stories in his celebrated book Harvard Episodes (1897)Harvard Episodes by Charles Macomb Flandrau orig. published 1897, reprinted Westphalia Press 2014 and also in Diary of A Freshman (1901).Diary of A Freshman by Charles Macomb Flandrau, orig. published 1901, reprinted Kessinger Publishing 2010 In Harvard Episodes Flandrau (writing in 1897) depicts the multi-generational aspects of the club in describing an old graduate, \\"If they didn't actually know him, they knew of him. Even this crust is sweet to the returned graduate whose age is just far enough removed from either end of life's measure to make it intrinsically unimportant.\\" George de la Ruiz Santayana (1886) was made an honorary member in 1890 and spent a great deal of time at the Delphic as recounted in Joel Porte's (Ph.D.'62) book, Santayana at the 'Gas (1964).

While Bokassa was an anti-communist, this appears to have had no effect on their relationship. Diplomatic relations between the two countries began on 5 September 1969. In 1976, Bokassa proclaimed himself Emperor Bokassa I, and declared the Central African Empire. The eccentric dictator's first foreign visit after his lavish coronation was to Pyongyang. He returned to Pyongyang in 1978 just ahead of a Franco-African Summit in Paris, and signed a treaty of peace and friendship with Kim Il-sung. Friendly relations continued even after Bokassa was overthrown in 1979.

By the late seventies, the industrial port city of Vigo suffered high levels of youth unemployment and a massive, industrial reform of the naval sector. Born out of this context, the Movida viguesa was primarily a musical and aesthetic movement: a counterculture centered around nightlife and bars in the historic city center. It challenged the traditional values of the period amidst the general atmosphere of economic crisis as well as political skepticism (resulting from an overall sense of disenchantment during the political transition from Franco's fascist dictatorship to a democracy).  Origins  The movida viguesa was born out of local pubs and bars like Angara and Satchmo. The city boomed with new bands, leading to the rise of music groups like Bar, TrenVigo and Mari Cruz Soriano y los que afinan su piano (later known as Siniestro Total). Heavily influenced by postmodernism, each had with their own distinct style (punk, pop, techno, reggae, ska, funk) with chaotic, comical and irreverent lyrics that reflect the concentrated plurality of voices and opinions. The movida then spread to other iconic pubs, many of which are still open, such as El Kremlin, El Manco de Lepanto and El Ruralex (now called Vademécum). Among the more notable bands of this period were Golpes Bajos (a grouped organized by Germán Coppini), Aerolíneas Federales, Os Resentidos (led by Antón Reixa), Semen Up and Ultramarinos Troncoso (the only techno band in Vigo during this period). They enjoyed incredible success, but only Siniestro Total is still active today, achieving international success. Video art was a particularly significant medium of the time. Director Xavier Villaverde produced one of the most recognizable music videos of the Movida viguesa: “Galicia Caníbal” by Os Resentidos. This song would later become an anthem of the Movida viguesa, achieving national recognition throughout Spain. During a weekend trip to Galicia in September, 1986, Cabinete Caligari, Los Nikis, Alaska and los Pegamoides effectively married the movida madrileña and the movida viguesa. A planned reunion in Madrid (spring, 1987) failed to take place.

A substantial community would grow up later by soldiers and mercenaries who settled in the second half of the 18th century and made a name for themselves in the Ottoman struggle to expel French troops in 1798–1801. Muhammad Ali (1769–1849) who was of Albanian descent, was the ruler who had founded the New Kingdom of Egypt which lasted there until 1952. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, many other Albanians settled into Egypt for economical and political reasons. With the fedayeen, Muslim Brotherhood, and the culminating Egyptian Revolution of 1952 the Albanian community in Egypt totally diminished and they settled in Western countries. Ottoman Era Since 1517, Egypt became an Ottoman province. An Ottoman ruler would be appointed in Cairo. The title \\"beylerbey\\" refers to the regular governors specifically appointed to the post by the Ottoman sultan, while the title \\"kaymakam\\", when used in the context of Ottoman Egypt, refers to an acting governor who ruled over the province between the departure of the previous governor and the arrival of the next one. Several of these were of Albanian descent, as well as many within the military and bashiazouk units. Between the most known were Dukakinzade Mehmed Pasha,. Koca Sinan Pasha, Abdurrahman Abdi Arnavut Pasha, and Mere Hüseyin Pasha.. During and after the French campaign in Egypt and Syria, the Ottomans would deploy many Albanian pashas, beys, military units, as well as auxiliary personnel. Some of them were Tahir Pasha Pojani with his brothers Hasan Pasha, Dalip, Isuf, and Abdul Bey, Omer Pasha Vrioni, Muharrem Bey Vrioni, Rustem Aga Shkodrani and so on. Sarechesme Halil Agha, commanding the Kavala Volunteer Contingent, would bring along his cousin, Muhammad (Mehmed) Ali, a young second rank commander. Muhammad Ali Era Prayer in the house of an Arnaut chief, by Jean-Léon Gérôme, 1857. Egypt under Muhammad Ali Dynasty Muhammad Ali was an Albanian commander in the Ottoman army that was sent to drive Napoleon's forces out of Egypt, but upon the French withdrawal, seized power himself and forced the Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II to recognize him as Wāli, or Governor of Egypt in 1805. His father, Ibrahim Agha, was from Korca, Albania, who had moved to Kavala. Demonstrating his grander ambitions, he took the title of Khedive; however, this was not sanctioned by the Sublime Porte. Muhammad Ali transformed Egypt into a regional power which he saw as the natural successor to the decaying Ottoman Empire. He constructed a military state with around four percent of the populace serving the army to raise Egypt to a powerful positioning in the Ottoman Empire in a way showing various similarities to the Soviet strategies (without communism) conducted in the 20th century. Muhammad Ali summed up his vision for Egypt in this way: Portrait of Muhammad Ali Pasha in the Cairo Citadel museum At the height of his power, Muhammad Ali and his son Ibrahim Pasha's military strength did indeed threaten the very existence of the Ottoman Empire as he sought to supplant the Osman Dynasty with his own. Ultimately, the intervention of the Great Powers prevented Egyptian forces from marching on Constantinople, and henceforth, his dynasty's rule would be limited to Africa, and Sinai. Muhammad Ali had conquered Sudan in the first half of his reign and Egyptian control would be consolidated and expanded under his successors, most notably Ibrahim Pasha's son Isma'il I. Khedivate and British occupation Khedive Isma'il Though Muhammad Ali and his descendants used the title of Khedive (Viceroy) in preference to the lesser Wāli, this was not recognized by the Porte until 1867 when Sultan Abdul-Aziz officially sanctioned its use by Isma'il Pasha and his successors. In contrast to his grandfather's policy of war against the Porte, Isma'il sought to strengthen the position of Egypt and Sudan and his dynasty using less confrontational means, and through a mixture of flattery and bribery, Isma'il secured official Ottoman recognition of Egypt and Sudan's virtual independence. This freedom was severely undermined in 1879 when the Sultan colluded with the Great Powers to depose Isma'il in favor of his son Tewfik. Three years later, Egypt and Sudan's freedom became little more than symbolic when the United Kingdom invaded and occupied the country, ostensibly to support Khedive Tewfik against his opponents in Ahmed Orabi's nationalist government. While the Khedive would continue to rule over Egypt and Sudan in name, in reality, ultimate power resided with the British High Commissioner. Albanian Patrol in Cairo by Jean-Léon Gérôme, ca. 1870. In defiance of the Egyptians, the British proclaimed Sudan to be an Anglo-Egyptian Condominium, a territory under joint British and Egyptian rule rather than an integral part of Egypt. This was continually rejected by Egyptians, both in government and in the public at large, who insisted on the \\"unity of the Nile Valley\\", and would remain an issue of controversy and enmity between Egypt and Britain until Sudan's independence in 1956. Sultanate and Kingdom In 1914, Khedive Abbas II sided with the Ottoman Empire which had joined the Central Powers in the World War I, and was promptly deposed by the British in favor of his uncle Hussein Kamel. The legal fiction of Ottoman sovereignty over Egypt and Sudan, which had for all intents and purposes ended in 1805, was officially terminated, Hussein Kamel was declared Sultan of Egypt and Sudan, and the country became a British Protectorate. With nationalist sentiment rising, as evidenced by the revolution of 1919, Britain formally recognized Egyptian independence in 1922, and Hussein Kamel's successor, Sultan Fuad I, substituted the title of King for Sultan. However, British occupation and interference in Egyptian and Sudanese affairs persisted. Of particular concern to Egypt was Britain's continual efforts to divest Egypt of all control in Sudan. To both the King and the nationalist movement, this was intolerable, and the Egyptian Government made a point of stressing that Fuad and his son King Farouk I were \\"King of Egypt and Sudan\\". Dissolution The reign of Farouk was characterized by ever increasing nationalist discontent over the British occupation, royal corruption and incompetence, and the disastrous 1948 Arab–Israeli War. All these factors served to terminally undermine Farouk's position and paved the way for the revolution of 1952. Farouk was forced to abdicate in favor of his infant son Ahmed-Fuad who became King Fuad II, while administration of the country passed to the Free Officers Movement under Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser. The infant king's reign lasted less than a year and on June 18, 1953, the revolutionaries abolished the monarchy and declared Egypt a republic, ending a century and a half of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty's rule. Emerging victorious from a war-triangle (Ottomans, Mamluks, and his loyal troops), Mehmed Ali made good use of Albanian irregulars services as mercenaries and troops to bolster his reign. Albanian mercenaries, or Arnauts, presented the backbone of Ali's army and were known as elite and undisciplined soldiers of the Ottoman Empire armies.... With the rise of Muhammad Ali in power, many of them would settle in Egypt and serve there. By 1815, the number of Albanian military was over 7000. Albanian troops partook in the war against the Wahhabi movement in Arabia (1811–18) and in the conquest of the Sudan (1820–24)... The number of Albanian troops would diminish in 1823, when Ibrahim Pasha, Ali's son, would join the Ottoman armies in the Greek War of Independence along with circa 17,000 men, many of them Albanians.. Ali's dynasty would continue to rule Egypt until 1952. Albanian National Awakening and early 20th century Albanian guards performing the sword-dance in front of local audience and musicians by Jean-Léon Gérôme, 1885. Albanian immigration to Egypt continued throughout the 19th century, and indeed into the first three decades of the 20th century. By that time Egypt experienced a massive economic development and prosperity, French and British investments (i.e. the Suez Canal), modernization, and opportunity for entrepreneurship. The economical prosperity attracted many emigrants from the Albanian lands, mainly from Korçë and Kolonjë regions. With some exceptions, most of the figures were educated members of the Orthodox community from south Albania who stationed in the vicinity of the Greek communities. Some of them published articles in the Greek community newspapers as well, frequently polemizing regarding Albanian identity.. para. 15, 22, 25, 28. The Albanian community in Egypt, with their patriotic societies and publishing activities, played an important role in the Albanian national awakening at the end of the 19th century. The first Albanian society of Egypt was founded in 1875. It was named \\"Vëllazëria e Parë\\" (First Brotherhood) and was led by Thimi Mitko. Sentinel in Cairo by Charles Bargue, 1877. Nationalist figures and writers such as Thimi Mitko, Spiro Dine, Filip Shiroka, Jani Vruho, Nikolla Naço, Anastas Avramidhi, Thoma Kreini, Thoma Avrami, Thanas Tashko, Stefan Zurani, Andon Zako Çajupi, Mihal Zallari, Milo Duçi, Loni Logori, Fan Noli, Aleksandër Xhuvani, Gaqo Adhamidhi and many others were all active in Egypt at some point in their careers. Some of them used it as temporary solution before moving to US or elsewhere, while some other settled permanently. Spiro Dine founded in 1881 the local branch of Society for the Publication of Albanian Writings in Shibin Al Kawm, a precursor and lobbyist for the Albanian education which started with the Albanian School of Korçë.. Many newspapers and collections would come out, including the successful Shkopi (\\"The stick\\"), Rrufeja (\\"The lightning\\"), Belietta Sskiypetare (\\"The Albanian Bee\\") and so on. Many others would come out for a shorter time: Milo Duçi would publish the magazines Toska (The Tosk) during 1901–02, Besa-Besë (Pledge for a pledge) during 1904-05 together with Thoma Avrami, Besa (Besa) of 1905 which lasted for 6 issues and was printed by Al-Tawfik in Cairo, and newspapers Shqipëria (Albania) from October 1906 to February 1907, a daily of Cairo with the last two issues coming out in Maghagha,. and the weekly Bisedimet (The discussions) of 1925–26 with 60 issues in total, which would be the last Albanian-language newspaper in Egypt. Aleksander Xhuvani published the newspaper Shkreptima (The lightning) in 1912 in Cairo. In 1922, Duçi established also the publishing company Shtëpia botonjëse shqiptare/Société Albanaise d'édition (Albanian Publishing House).. Prominent Albanian organizations were: \\"Vëllazëria Shqiptare\\" (Albanian Fraternity) founded on 1 My 1894 in Beni-Suef, and \\"Bashkimi\\" (The union) which was found everywhere in Albanian populated areas and diaspora. It was an Albanian high official in Egypt, who sponsored the Giuseppe Verdi's opera Aida in Khedivial Opera House in 1871.. In 1907, with the initiative of Mihal Turtulli, Jani Vruho, and Thanas Tashko, the Albanian community send a promemorium to the Second Hague Conference for Peace, demanding support for the civic rights of the Albanian population under the oppression of Abdul Hamid II. Thanas Tashko would represent the community in the Congress of Manastir of 1908, while Loni Logori in the Congress of Elbasan of 1909. Another prominent Albanian, Fan Noli, would settle shortly in Egypt. Vruho and Tashko convinced him to move to US, and supported him financially. Another memorandum was signed with the initiative of Andon Zako and was sent to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. In 1924, a regrouping of the Albanian clubs and societies was done in Cairo, under a unique society named \\"Lidhja e Shqiptarve te Egjiptit\\" (The League of the Albanians of Egypt), with Jani Vruho as chairman. More societies would follow; \\"Shoqerija Mireberse\\" (Benefactor Society) of Hipokrat Goda from Korçë established in 1926, and \\"Shoqeria e Miqeve\\" (Friends' Club) of Andon Zako in 1927. Thoma Kreini founded the \\"Tomorri\\" society, hoping to publish a newspaper with the same name but was unsuccessful. An Albanian school operated during 1934–1939, initially supported by the \\"Shpresa\\" (Hope) society founded by Stathi Ikonomi, and later by the exiled King Zog I. Evangjel Avramushi established in 1940 the first cinematographic studio in Egypt, named \\"AHRAM\\". The Albanian Bektashi community had its own tekke in Egypt,. \\"This was an age when Albanians and Bosnians were posted to garrisons within the Nile regions, and furthermore the bulk of the Albanian troops were uncultured, exceedingly unruly, and often hated. Yet the dynasty that Muhammad ‘Alī established, the affection it had for Albanians and received from them, and the haven it afforded to them as exiles from Ottoman control, victimisation by Greek neighbours, or the sheer misery of Balkan poverty, meant that in time Alexandria, Cairo, Beni Suef and other Egyptian towns would harbour Albanians who organised associations, published newspapers and above all wrote works in verse and prose that include significant masterpieces of modern Albanian literature. Within al-Azhar and the two Baktāshi tekkes in Cairo, Qaṣr al-’Aynī and Kajgusez Abdullah Megavriu, Albanians and Balkan contemporaries were to find inspiration for a mystical quest, and artistic and literary stimulus, that sent ripples, as on a pond, throughout Albanian and Egyptian circles in Cairo and distantly and remotely in towns of Albania, Kosovo and Macedonia. Some of the outstanding literary figures of modern Albanian literature — for example, Thimi Mitko (d. 1890), the author of collections of Albanian folksongs, folk-tales and sayings, in his The Albanian Bee (Bleta Shqypëtare), Spiro Dine (d. 1922) in his Waves of the Sea (Valët e detit) and Andon Zako Çajupi (1866-1930) in his Baba Tomorri (Cairo, 1902) and his Skanderbeg drama — although they lived in Egypt for much of their lives, were essentially nationalists and not much influenced by the Islamic way of life that they saw around them. If anything, the rural arid peasant life in Egypt acted as a spur to their absorption in popular traditions which, in their view, enshrined the soul of their people. The Albanians in Egypt were, without a doubt, influenced by the Egyptian theatre — but specifically by those elements not overtly infused with Islamic sentiments. Later writers became prominent figures among the Albanian community in Cairo. Milo Duçi (Duqi) (d. 1933) did so because of his office as president of the national ‘Brethren’ league (Villazëria/Ikhwa), and by his Albanian newspapers (al-‘Ahd, 1900, known in Egypt as al-Aḥādīth, 1925). He also wrote plays, especially ‘The Saying’ (E Thëna, 1922) and ‘The Bey's Son’ (1923), and a novel Midis dy grash (Between two women, 1923). More recently still, it has been secular and Arab nationalist causes such as Palestine and Algeria that have inspired Albanian Egyptian writers.\\" the famed \\"Magauri tekke\\" on the outskirts of Cairo, which was headed by Baba Ahmet Sirri Glina of Përmet.. The tekke would be visited frequently by King Faruk. Prince Kamal el Dine Hussein, Princess Zeynepe, daughter of Isma'il Pasha, Princess Myzejen Zogolli, sister of King Zog I were some of the notables who were buried there. Discrimination Immediately afterwards - with the seizure of power by Gamel Abdel Nasser and the subsequent nationalist Arabization policy in Egypt, many Albanians left Egypt for Albania and the United States. Many Albanian families who decided to stay in Egypt were partly assimilated and some killed by the Army of Gamel Abdel Nasser. A few Albanians kept coming to Egypt throughout World War II and afterwards, most of them doing so to escape the Communist regime in Albania established on November 1944. Names would include Baba Rexheb, a Bektashi monk, former minister Mirash Ivanaj, Branko Merxhani, and even the former King Ahmet Zogu with his family. After King Zog and the Albanian royal family were forced out of Albania during the war, they took up residence in Egypt from 1946 to 1955 and were received by King Farouk who reigned during 1936–1952, himself a descendant of Mehmed Ali Pasha. The presence of this Albanian community lasted in Egypt until Gamal Abdel Nasser came to power. With the advent of Gamal Abdel Nasser and the Arab nationalization of Egypt, not only the royal family but also the entire Albanian community of around 4,000 families became the targets of hostility. They were forced to leave the country, thus closing the Albanian chapter in Egypt. Most of the Bektashi community moved to U.S. or Canada. Baba Rexheb established the first Albanian-American Bektashi monastery in the Detroit suburb of Taylor.. With the rise in power of Anwar Sadat, the stance toward Albanians changed, but just a few from the exiled families returned to Egypt. In recent times the number of people estimated to be of Albanian heritage in Egypt is 18,000.. \\"Egypt also lays claim to some 18,000 Albanians, supposedly lingering remnants of Mohammad Ali's army.\\" Famous Albanians of Egypt In art In 1856, the French painter Jean-Léon Gérôme (1824–1904) journeyed to Egypt. This visit was decisive for his development as an Orientalist painter and much of his subsequent work was devoted to orientalist paintings. The sizeable Albanian guards and the janissary troops settled on the banks of the Nile during the early rule of Mehmed Ali' dynasty, played a major role in Gérôme's paintings. He was fascinated by their swagger, their weapons and their costumes, particularly by the pleats of their typical white fustanellas.

Originally based in Froland, since 1969 it operated out of Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik. Agderfly was owned by Ola Rustenberg, who was also chief instructor. From 1989 to 1992 the company was split into three, with one part responsible for scheduled services. It operated two Dornier Do 228 and flew services from Kristiansand to Gothenburg, Billund and Bremen. History Agderfly was established by Ola Rustenberg when be bought a Jodel D.120 in 1966. The airline was initially based at Trevann in Froland. Two years later it bought a second aircraft, a Malmö MFI-9B and started using it for pilot training. Agderfly relocated to Kjevik in 1969.Bakken: 57 An accident in 1974 caused Agderfly to replace its MFI with a Beagle Pup. It was replaced with a Robin DR400 three years later.Hagby: 148 It was supplemented with a Piper Cherokee in 1979. The same year the company built a hangar. This allowed the operations to expand. First a Partenavia P.68 was bought, then replaced with two Piper Seneca. Agderfly signed a contract to fly patients from Vest-Agder Central Hospital to Oslo in 1980. During the early 1980s Agderfly shifted its business model. A cooperation was started with Skjelbreds Rederi and the aviation company changed its name to A/S Nortrans Agderfly. During this period the Senecas were sold and replaced with a Piper Navajo and a Piper Aztec. For a period it also leased a Mitsubishi MU-2. Rustenstad bought back the part of the company he didn't own in 1985 and changed the name back to Agderfly. The MU2 was sold in 1987 and replaced with a Grumman Cougar, a Bellanca Super Decathlon and a Socata Rallye. During this period the pilot school specialized in converting military pilots to civilian certificates, and offered commercial B, C and D licenses.Bakken: 58 The partnership with Skjelbred resulted in Agderfly seeking to establish itself as a scheduled airline. It applied in for concession to operate to Gothenburg from Kristiansand. This was rejected by the Ministry of Transport and Communications in 1986, citing Scandinavian Airlines System's monopoly on inter-Scandinavian routes. However, the regulations were gradually being deregulated an on 13 November 1987 the airline was granted its concession. Agderfly went through a major restructuring to operate the service. It was split into three operating companies, one for the school, one for the mechanical services and one for the passenger flights. This resulted in the ownership in the flight company being spread out between a series of local investors. Svein Grødum had in late 1989 a 40-percent ownership, while Thor Tjøntveit owned 30 percent. Minor owners were Leif Hubert, Oddleiv Eidjord and Einar Øgrey. Twice in 1989 the company issued new shares, increasing its share capital from 1 to 2 million Norwegian krone (NOK). It opted in late 1988 to buy two Dornier Do 228 for Norving for the route. The same year it received permission to operate a route to Billund Airport in Denmark. The service to Göteborg Landvetter Airport commenced on 26 September 1989, followed by the Billund route on 2 October. Eidjord became the majority shareholder of the flight company in September 1990, after buying shares from among others Tjøntveit and Grødum. Agderfly received concession to operate from Kristiansand to Bremen Airport and started these flights in early 1991. In early 1991 the airline wet leased its aircraft to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to fly relief aid to Turkey and Iran. This and other chapter operations were profitable for the company, while the scheduled services ran at a loss. Eidfjord sold his share of the company and Air Express to Petter Ringvold in May 1991. He reorganize the companies so that Agderfly became a subsidiary of Air Express. By September only the Gothenburg route was still being flown, and even it was incurring a loss of NOK 100,000 per month. The airline was futile in its attempts to receive municipal subsidies to cover the operating losses. Agderfly's flight company filed for bankruptcy on 21 November 1991, citing that it was operating with a loss. At the time it had fourteen employees. Agderfly's school program was based on that the first part of the theory was taken as correspondence and the second part at the school, a system that had been in place since 1977. The Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) reacted to this in 1990, stating that the correspondence system was not in line with regulations. They did not react to that part of the courses were taken as correspondence, but rather the amount of the material which followed this material. They therefore withdrew Agderfly's approval in 1990. This hindered them from taking up a grade of pupils, costing them in excess of NOK 1 million. The school felt that the CAA were not following procedure and sued them. They lost the case in three instances. However, in 1996 the Ministry of Transport and Communication stated that the CAA had not followed procedure when closing the school. Agderfly was fined for use of an unapproved aircraft part in 1994. Following the global decline of the airline market and pilot demand from 2001 and onwards, Agderfly failed to fill its courses. By 2004 operations in Agderfly had ceased, although not liquidated. Rustenberg continued to pursue possibilities to reestablish a pilot school at Kjevik. The first steps for such approval were granted in 2008, although this was carried on in another company.

Neither country maintains an embassy in their respective capitals, although DPRK formerly had one in Windhoek, which closed down in 1994. History During the Namibian War of Independence, the DPRK provided significant support for the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), the armed wing of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). Like many other pro-Soviet countries during the Cold War, the DPRK provided material aid to PLAN, and from 1965 and onwards many SWAPO members went to Pyongyang to receive military training. Relations have remained close after Namibia's independence in 1990. The country's first President, Sam Nujoma, was especially close to the DPRK. In 1992, he received the Order of the National Flag, a high DPRK decoration. Mansudae Overseas Projects, a DPRK construction company, has been behind several expensive projects in Namibia – among them Heroes' Acre, a war memorial opened in 2002 in Windhoek. The physical features of the statue of the Unknown Soldier reportedly closely resemble those of Nujoma. The company is also behind renovations to Nujoma's private home, as well as several other major projects – among them the Windhoek Independence Memorial, the State House of Namibia, and an independence museum also featuring a statue of President Nujoma. Nujoma's successor, President Hifikepunye Pohamba, likewise remained close to the DPRK. In 2008 Kim Yong- nam, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, visited Namibia and met with the President. Several agreements between the two countries were signed, to strengthen among other things bilateral co-operation on trade, commerce, transport, energy and defence. Following the death of Kim Jong-il in 2011, the Namibian government stated that his passing would not affect Namibian-North Korean relations. In 2012, it was reported that Namibia had contracted the DPRK to build thirteen \\"mini-state houses\\" in each of the country's regions for President Pohamba, a hugely expensive move which faced immediate criticism. In 2016, it was confirmed that military co-operation was continuing.

It is the only bird book covering the nation as a country with more than 250 million people and more endemic and globally threatened bird species than any other in the world. History The book was first published in 2001 by Periplus Editions (HK) Ltd. Production and editorial work was done by Berkeley Books Pte Ltd in Singapore. Publisher was Eric Oey; Julia Walkden and Rod Ritchie were the editors. Dr. Bas van Balen provided advice as scientific editor. The binding in the first edition was a normal paperback cover with a collage of six different birds. The first edition was 190 mm high and 125 mm wide, weighing 575 grams. In this edition Morten Strange was credited with both text and photos. It covered 686 species; most were illustrated by the author; some 30 other bird photographers provided additional images. In both the first and the second edition of the book there are two bird species featured per page, each with one or more photographs as well as a distribution map. The taxonomy and nomenclature in the first edition followed The Birds of Indonesia: a Checklist by Peter Andrew from 1992; this was the most used checklist at the time, using the so-called ‘crows-last’ sequence. The book was a companion to A Photographic Guide to the Birds of Southeast Asia which was published the previous year, in 2000. However, this volume used a different checklist as a reference with a ‘buntings last’ sequence. A Photographic Guide to the Birds of Indonesia was reprinted several times during the following years, but without corrections or updates. In 2003, it was co-published in a deal with Princeton University Press for the US market and Christopher Helm (an imprint of A&C; Black Publishers Ltd) for the UK market; some of these imprints might still appear as used copies on internet book sites. Periplus distributed the book in Asia and in Indonesia, where it sold well. By 2012 a lot of new information and photographic material on the birds of Indonesia had emerged, and work on a second edition was started. The editorial work was again done in Singapore under supervision of Nancy Goh at Berkeley Books Pte Ltd. The second edition involved a total revamp of the material; a new checklist was used on the basis of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World 6th Edition from 2007. This list has 1,605 bird species for Indonesia, while the 1992 list had 1,534. It also uses the ‘buntings last’ sequence which means that the Indonesian book now uses the same sequence as the companion volume A Photographic Guide to the Birds of Southeast Asia. However, while Southeast Asia came out in 2012 with just a new cover and imprint, Indonesia came out that year in a second edition and was dramatically changed. The new cover is flexibound vinyl extending out over the content pages. There is a single cover photo; the book is published using the Tuttle Publishing imprint. Periplus Editions (HK) Ltd is now the sole distributor of the book. In this edition, Morten Strange is credited as the author but not with text and photos, as only some 50% of the photographs are now his. In the second edition, new photographers such as James Eaton, Robert Hutchinson, Pete Morris and Bram Demeulemeester are the main contributors of new, rare and endemic species. Filip Verbelen, who also contributed to the first edition, is now next to the author as the main contributor. A total of more than 40 bird photographer participated in the project, including new Indonesian field researchers. The second edition was expanded from 416 to 544 pages and now weighs 780 grams and illustrates 912 species, out of which 213 are endemic (found only in Indonesia). As such, it is the most comprehensive photographic bird guide to any country in the world. In the second edition the opening chapters have been totally re-written and updated; the book now also includes an annotated checklist to all the species in Indonesia, the ones covered in the photographic section are highlighted in the full checklist at the back of the book. In 2014, the book was reprinted with corrections and updates. An additional 37 photos were replaced with new and better ones; a misidentified bird (the Flores hawk-eagle) was renamed, and another species (Sumatran laughingthrush) was split out as endemic following the latest taxonomy. Threat status and icons for all globally threatened species were revised, and the annotations in the checklist were updated for each subregion using the latest information available. In 2015, the book was reprinted again. In this reprint, two photographs were replaced and all nomenclature, taxonomy, distribution data and global threat status was updated throughout the book. The total number of species in the checklist was revised upwards to 1608 species.

Kane translates arjava as straightforwardness.PV Kane (1974), History of Dharmaśāstra: (ancient and Mediæval Religious and Civil Law in India), Vol 2, Issue 1, , page 5 It is explained in ancient Indian texts as “self-restraint from hypocrisy\\", and \\"the absence of hypocrisy”. It is included as one of several ethical virtuous restraints in an individual's path to spirituality. The Maharashtrian poet Vāmana in Avigita, at xvi.1, posits arjava is a form of honesty and purity in a person, and an essential virtue so that one may treat everyone equally, whether that other is one’s child, wife, relative, friend, a stranger, someone hostile or oneself without any discrimination. The ethical concept of Arjava is synonymously referred to as Adambha (अदम्भ, composite word from अ+दम्भ). Adambha also meansAdambha Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany non-deceitful, straightforwardness and sincerity. It is listed as a virtue in the Indian Epics. Literature Arjava is one of the ten yamas listed by Śāṇḍilya Upanishad, as well as by Svātmārāma. It is one of the virtuous restraints (yamas) taught in ancient Indian texts. The other nine yamas are Ahiṃsā (अहिंसा): Nonviolence, Satya (सत्य): truthfulness, Asteya (अस्तेय): not stealing, Brahmacharya (ब्रह्मचर्य): celibacy and not cheating on one’s spouse, Kṣamā (क्षमा): forgiveness,Stuart Sovatsky (1998), Words from the Soul: Time East/West Spirituality and Psychotherapeutic Narrative, State University of New York, , page 21 Dhṛti (धृति): fortitude, Dayā (दया): compassion, Mitāhāra (मितहार): measured diet, and Śauca (शौच): purity, cleanliness. In some texts, such as by Adi Sankara, this virtue is called as bhavasamsuddhi, and explained as purity of motive and freedom of mind from hypocrisy, both in one’s social conduct, as well as within oneself where one’s thoughts, words and actions resonate. It is considered as a virtue that empowers one to act and live without anxiety, anger, prejudice, inner conflict or confusion. It is also discussed in Bhagwad Gita in verse 17.16.Christopher Key Chapple (2009), The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition, State University of New York Press, , page 649 The Mahabharata, in Book 12 Chapter 60, lists Adambha (non-hypocrisy) as a virtue along with Akrodha (non-anger), Kshama (forgiveness) and others.Ian Proudfoot, Ahiṃsā and a Mahābhārata Story, Faculty of Asian Studies, Australian National University, , page 185 In the same book, in Chapter 278, the Epic explains how and why hypocrisy arises, suggesting that it is a derivative of the sin of covetousness, greed and attachment to superficial possessions.Shanti Parva The Mahabharata, Section CCLXXIII, KM Ganguli (Translator) Patanjali's treatise on Yoga lists only five yamas, which includes non-covetousness and non-possessiveness (Asteya and Aparigraha respectively), but does not include Arjava.

R. Dumas, was a South Australian newspaper proprietor and politician. He was the proprietor of The Mount Barker Courier and Onkaparinga and Gumeracha Advertiser for 54 years and served as president of the South Australian Provincial Press Association from 1915 until his death. He was a member of the South Australian House of Assembly from 1898 to 1902, representing the electorate of Mount Barker. History Charles was born in Sydney the second son of Victor Dumas (1806 – 26 December 1882) and his wife Frances (ca.1816 – 20 February 1903); the family moved to Mount Barker in 1854. He was educated at the private school run by his father, then spent a few years in Adelaide to qualify as a Master Printer. In 1872 he purchased Mr. Jolly's printery in Mount Barker, and on 1 October 1880 produced the first issue of the Mount Barker Courier, or to give its full name, The Mount Barker Courier and Onkaparinga and Gumeracha Advertiser. He supervised the business as the sole proprietor for 54 years, a record rarely equalled in Australian provincial newspapers. He was a member of the South Australian Provincial Press Association, and elected its president in April 1915; he held that position until the time of his death. In 1923 the Provincial Press Cooperative Company of South Australia, which took over the advertising agency of Colonel Hampson, was formed. Dumas was chosen chairman of directors, and retained that position until the time of his death. The Courier remained in his and his family's hands until 1 May 1938, when it was sold to T. H. Monger.

Returns is a strategy mobile game by Toronto-based developer Comma 8 Studios. It is a licensed iOS remake of the 1983 classic M.U.L.E.  Gameplay  The gameplay of M.U.L.E. Returns closely follows that of the original M.U.L.E., though the controls are adapted for mobile device touchscreens. Improvements over the original include a pause feature, three difficulty modes, social media integration, and the ability to apply custom skins.  Development  In 2012, Electronic Arts was in licensing negotiations with M.U.L.E.'s original developers, Ozark Softscape, though these were unsuccessful and Ozark ultimately awarded mobile platform rights to Comma 8 Studios. Comma 8 began developing the game simultaneously for iOS and Android, using C++ and a framework middleware. To create as faithful a reproduction as possible, the developers traced and reimplemented the original 8-bit code.  Release  Comma 8 released an official trailer for the game on 27 June 2012, and discussed the game's development at World of Commodore 2012 in December. The game was originally slated to be released in mid-2012, though this was pushed back repeatedly, first to the end of the year, then to early 2013, and finally to late 2013. The game was eventually released for iOS on 25 November 2013 and was presented the following week at the 2013 World of Commodore in Toronto. The Android version was scheduled for a 2014 release but had not been published. Reception Reviewers' attitudes to M.U.L.E. Returns were split. Matt Thrower of Gamezebo appreciated the game's \\"unique and enthralling mixture of strategic concerns propelled forward by real-time pressures\\" but criticized its patchy tutorial, sloppy artificial intelligence, and showstopping bugs. Pocket Gamer Harry Slater, who is not a fan of the original M.U.L.E., criticized the remake as \\"outdated, with sloppy touch controls and far-from impressive backdrops\\". 148Apps had a more positive opinion of the game, awarding it four out of five stars and praising its sophisticated supply-and-demand economics. Like Gamezebo, however, they bemoaned its failure to implement the original's multiplayer mode.

For his service Debeaumarché was highly decorated. In 1960 Debeaumarché received the posthumous distinction of being depicted on a postage stamp in the series Heroes of the Resistance.  Biography  Debeaumarché was born on 15 December 1906 in Dijon, and first wanted to become a pilot, but his eyesight was too weak and he joined the French postal service, PTT. He was mobilized in September 1939 as a sergeant in the French Air Force and after June 1940 joined the French Resistance. Debeaumarché was in charge of the transportation of mail, a position he used to smuggle mail for the resistance. From the summer of 1943 on, he was on the staff of the Action-PTT, a clandestine organisation within the French postal service, and worked with Ernest Pruvost, its national leader, and directly under Simone Michel-Lévy, establishing postal communications with London. When Michel-Levy was arrested in November 1943, Debeaumarché took over as head of the Action- PTT. Traveling throughout France he created networks of resistance, and organized the sabotage of the enemy's telecommunications (the plans Potard and Violet—the latter involved cutting telephone cables before D-Day). In addition, he managed to procure the codebooks of the three secret codes used by Joseph Darnand and the Milice and used them to decipher copies of telegrams obtained from the central telegraph office in Paris. The deciphered texts were then passed on to Allied intelligence. He was arrested on 3 August 1944 at the Gare Montparnasse, and questioned harshly by the Gestapo at the Rue des Saussaies. He lost consciousness under the beatings but did not divulge any names; he was subsequently held at Fresnes Prison. Debeaumarché was one of the so-called \\"77,000\\" (named for the prisoners' numbers, between 76,000 and 78,000), Fresnes prisoners who were transported by train from Pantin to Buchenwald on 15 August 1944. He was moved to the underground factory of Mittelbau-Dora which produced V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets, and posing as an electrical engineer was put to work in the manufacture of the V-1. Maurice Naegelé, a Kapo in the tunnel assembly section, gained the trust of Debeaumarché by relating details of the resistance movement in France. In fact Naegelé had been an agent of the Gestapo, before his deportation. Naegelé denounced Debeaumarché to SS-Oberscharführer Sander, head of surveillance at Mittelbau-Dora. Debeaumarché was arrested with others (including Naegelé) on the night of 3–4 November 1944. They were taken to the Niedersachswerfen SD headquarters, where Naegelé attempted to beat confessions out of the other prisoners. Debeaumarché was sentenced to death on 11 November 1944, but the sentence was not carried out. Instead Debeaumarché was held in solitary confinement, accused of anti-Nazi plotting. In April 1945 he was moved to Bergen-Belsen, where he was liberated during the advance of Allied troops on 15 April 1945 and repatriated to France. On 1 May 1945 he marched down the Champs-Élysées alongside fellow Buchenwald-captive Pierre Dejussieu- Pontcarral. After the war, he was a member of the Assemblée consultative provisoire and had a number of high administrative functions with the PTT. He served as president of the Union Nationale des Associations de Déportés, Internés et Familles de disparus. He died on 28 March 1959 in Suresnes, and was honored with a service in Les Invalides; his remains were buried in Dijon.

The book is a biographical portrait of photographer and inventor Eadweard Muybridge, a history of the development of technological change in the West during the later half of the nineteenth century that led to development of the modern film industry in Hollywood and later the information technology industry in Silicon Valley, and an essay focusing on a series of connections between Muybridge's life and the changing human landscape of the American West. In 2004, Solnit was awarded the National Book Critics Circle Award in Criticism, the Sally Hacker Prize from the Society for the History of Technology, and Harvard's Mark Lynton History Prize for River of Shadows.  Background and Contents  In an interview with PBS, Solnit explains that Muybridge was born in 1830, the same year the first passenger railway ran in England and thus his life spans from the birth of the railroad through the birth of aviation technology. Muybridge's life story itself seems to hinge on three major crises: his carriage accident, his murder of his wife's lover, and his break with patron Leland Stanford. At the same time, his lifespan is also situated in a period and place during which the world around him was changing rapidly and, Solnit argues, in which human experience of time was also changing as a result of new technology. In 11 chapters, Solnit examines how the telegraph, the railroad, photography, and the science of geology all changed how humans understood time and situates Muybridge's role in history and his technological innovations within this context. Solnit has stated in an interview with the Believer that she considers herself a modern essayist, and River of Shadows is reflective of that style. While it contains elements of history and biography, it also contains many explorations of topics like the history of timekeeping itself that are related to the main ideas of the book.  Response  River of Shadows received a positive response from critics, including Jim Lewis of the New York Times, who called the book \\"deeply intelligent\\". For River of Shadows, Solnit was honored with the 2004 National Book Critics Circle Award in Criticism and the 2004 Sally Hacker Prize from the Society for the History of Technology, which honors exceptional scholarship that reaches beyond the academy toward a broad audience. Solnit was also awarded Harvard's Mark Lynton History Prize in 2004 for River of Shadows.  References in other works  In Solnit's 2008 essay Men who explain things, included in her 2014 collection of essays on feminism Men Explain Things to Me, Solnit references the publication of \\"River of Shadows\\" and the New York Times review in an anecdote she recounts about her interactions with a male guest at a party.

The reaction uses aryl iodides to perform bi- or tri-functionalization, including C-H functionalization of the unsubstituted ortho position(s), followed a terminating cross-coupling reaction at the ipso position. This cross-coupling cascade reaction depends on the ortho-directing transient mediator, norbornene. cis,exo-2-phenylnorbornyl palladium chloride dimer Catalytic cycle of the Catellani reaction. (Ligands and stereochemistry are omitted for clarity.)  Reaction mechanism  The Catellani reaction is catalyzed by palladium and norbornene, although in most cases superstochiometric amounts of norbornene are used to allow the reaction to proceed at a reasonable rate. The generally accepted reaction mechanism, as outlined below, is intricate and believed to proceed via a series of Pd(0), Pd(II), and Pd(IV) intermediates, although an alternative bimetallic mechanism that avoids the formation of Pd(IV) has also been suggested. Initially, Pd(0) oxidatively adds into the C–X bond of the aryl halide. Subsequently, the arylpalladium(II) species undergoes carbopalladation with the norbornene. The structure of the norbornylpalladium intermediate does not allow for β-hydride elimination at either of the β-positions due to Bredt's Rule for the bridgehead β-hydrogen and the trans-configuration between palladium and other β-hydrogen. Thereafter, the Pd(II) species undergoes electrophilic cyclopalladation at the ortho position of the aryl group. Subsequently, the palladacyclic intermediate undergoes a second oxidation addition with the alkyl halide coupling partner to form a Pd(IV) intermediate, which undergoes reductive elimination to forge the first C–C bond of the product. After β-carbon elimination of norbornene, the resultant Pd(II) species then undergoes a second C–C bond forming step via a Heck reaction or cross coupling with an organoboron reagent to afford the final organic product and close the catalytic cycle. Steps of the Catellani reaction: # Oxidative addition # Carbopalladation of norbornene # Palladacycle formation # Oxidative addition to palladacycle # Reductive elimination from palladacycle # Norbornene extrusion # Termination via Heck reaction, Suzuki reaction, etc. Ortho and ipso cross-coupling partners The Catellani reaction facilitates a variety of C—C and C—N bond-forming reactions at the ortho position. These include alkylation from alkyl halides, arylation from aryl bromides, amination from benzyloxyamines, acylation from anhydrides. Likewise in the case of terminating ipso coupling partners with Heck-type termination with olefins, Suzuki-type reaction with boronic esters, borylation with bis(pinacolato)diboron, protonation with i-PrOH, decarboxylative alkynylation with alkynyl carboxylic acids.  Uses  With tethered cross-coupling partners, Lautens, Malacria, and Catellani used this reaction to construct a variety of fused ring systems since 2000. The Catellani reaction has been used as a key step for the total synthesis (+)-linoxepin, rhazinal, aspidospermidine, and (±)-goniomitine.

Tiwai Point and the entrance to Awarua Bay (top) are to the left Bluff Harbour is a harbour and lagoon in the South Island, New Zealand town of Bluff. The main port facilities are located close to the entrance of a large natural inlet (also known as Bluff Harbour) which includes a large, low-lying eastern arm, Awarua Bay, immediately to the east of the promontory which gives the town and harbour its name. History Bluff is one of New Zealand's earliest continuously occupied European settlements, and has been visited by whalers and sealers since at least 1823. A whaling station was established here in 1836. Bluff Wharf was constructed during the 1860s, and was linked to the nearby city of Invercargill by rail in 1867. As the city's main port, it was a major centre for the export of dairy and meat products in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The construction of the Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter in 1971 led to further upgrades in facilities. A flying boat service operated from the harbour's Ocean Beach in the 1950s and 1960s, both for civilian services and for the RNZAF's patrols of subantarctic waters. Port facilities The port facilities are the southernmost in the South Island, and include the country's southernmost commercial deep water port.South Port New Zealand website. Retrieved 27 December 2014 The port operates under the commercial name of South Port NZ from a artificial island, Island Harbour, and includes a container terminal. Island Harbour was constructed over the course of the 1950s, and was officially opened in December 1960.\\"Bluff Island Harbour opened\\", New Zealand History, Ministry for Culture and Heritage, updated 24 October 2014. Retrieved 27 December 2014. A major cargo from the port is alumina from the Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter, which sits on Tiwai Point, the low-lying eastern shore of the harbour's mouth, directly opposite Island Harbour. The harbour is also used by Bluff's fishing fleet, mainly smaller vessels and to a large extent centred on Foveaux Strait oyster harvesting. The Bluff oyster is a major New Zealand delicacy. Bluff is also the northern terminus of the Stewart Island ferry, a daily service to and from Oban, which takes one hour to cross Foveaux Strait.\\"Stewart Island Ferry Services\\", Stewart Island Experience.

On 2 March 1942, McNair piloted one of 17 Spitfires launched from the British aircraft carrier HMS Eagle to the beleaguered island.McCaffery, p. 167 As a member of No. 249 Squadron RAF, he was frequently engaged in combat in the skies above Malta. He shot down a 109 on 19 March, a Junkers Ju 88 on 26 March, a 109 on 20 April and a Ju 88 on 22 April, making him an ace. He increased his tally by three 109s, on 22 May, 25 May and 10 June, before being recalled to England for a leave. He was promoted first to flying officer, then to flight lieutenant sometime during this period.McCaffery, p. 169 Rejoining No. 411 Squadron, McNair participated in the disastrous Dieppe Raid. On 19 August, he was credited with a probable kill of a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 and with damaging another. He was then sent home to Canada for six months rest and war bond drives. Declining command of a training school, McNair was assigned briefly to lead No. 416 Squadron RCAF, before being given command of No. 421 Squadron RCAF. On 10 July 1943, his Spitfire had engine trouble and burst into flame on the way home from a mission. He managed to parachute into the water, but his eyesight was permanently damaged, so he had to get closer to the enemy than before to compensate. He kept his handicap to himself, leading others to believe that he was being excessively reckless. Nonetheless, that year he brought down four Fw 190s (20 June 24 June, 6 September and 3 October) and an equal number of Bf 109s (6 July 10 July, 31 August and 3 September), bringing his final tally to 16 or 16.5 confirmed kills. In 1944, McNair was promoted to wing commander of 126 Wing, RAF Second Tactical Air Force at RAF Biggin Hill, which meant he no longer flew combat missions.Pigott, p. 97 After six months, he was reassigned from operational to administrative duties. Post-war McNair's grave in the Canadian Section of Brookwood Military Cemetery McNair remained in the RCAF after the war. Upon graduating from the Empire Flying Training School, he was posted to RAF Fakenham, Norfolk, to fly Gloster Meteor and de Havilland Vampire jet fighters. He later served as Air Advisor and Attaché of the Military Mission at the Canadian Embassy in Tokyo, Japan.Pigott, p. 98 For his contributions in the Korean War \\"as Royal Canadian Air Force Liaison Officer to the Far East Air Forces from 27 June 1951 to 27 July 1953,\\" the United States government offered to award McNair a Bronze Star Medal, but it was against RCAF policy. McNair was aboard a Canadair North Star which crashed at Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on 30 December 1953. He made sure that all passengers and crew were safely evacuated before leaving himself, despite being soaked in gasoline. For this, he was awarded the Queen's Commendation for Brave Conduct. He suffered spinal injuries and was treated for a year. McNair was promoted to group captain in 1956 and posted to No. 4 Fighter Wing in CFB Baden-Soellingen. In 1964, he was made Deputy-Commander of NORAD's Duluth sector.Pigott, p. 99 He later joined the Canadian Joint Staff office at the High Commission in London. McNair died of leukaemia and was buried in Brookwood Cemetery, Surrey, England. Family life McNair met Watford-born stenographer Barbara Gwendoline Still (1925–2006) on a blind date in London in 1942; they married in 1944England & Wales, Civil Registration Marriage Index, 1916–2005 for Robert W McNair – Ancestry.com and had two sons: Bruce and Lawrence Keith NcNair (1949–1998). On her death, she was buried beside her husband in Brookwood Cemetery. Honours McNair was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross on 22 May 1942, 27 July 1943 and 22 October 1943. In April 1944, Acting Wing Commander McNair was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. The French government awarded him the Croix de Guerre with Palm and made him a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour, both in September 1947. As noted in the previous section, he received the Queen's Commendation for Brave Conduct in August 1954. In 1990, he was inducted into Canada's Aviation Hall of Fame.

The society sponsors exhibitions, contests for student book collectors and Virginia printers, an international speakers’ series, and an active publications program which has produced over 175 separate publications in addition to its journal Studies in Bibliography.Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia, \\"History\\" The society was led for many years by Fredson Bowers, a University of Virginia faculty member, and was influential in applying and spreading the theories of textual criticism developed by Bowers and W. W. Greg which brought about changes in the study of manuscripts and the printing of books to ascertain the original intentions of authors. History After several years of preparation, on February 26, 1947 a group met in the University of Virginia library in Charlottesville and adopted a constitution that declared the object of their new society to be \\"to foster an interest in books (including books in manuscript), maps, printing, and bibliography.\\" The group called \\"The Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia.\\" The inaugural address was given by Fredson Bowers, a member of the faculty, speaking on \\"Some Problems and Practices in Bibliographical Descriptions of Modern Authors,\\" The leadership in the early years fell to Bowers, to John Cook Wyllie, and to Linton Massey. Bowers served as President in the Society's second and third years, 1948 and 1949, and then from its fifth year, 1951, up to 1974. By the late 1960s, the Society had nearly 1,000 members. Irby Cauthen, a charter member, became President in 1978. He was succeeded in 1993 by G. Thomas Tanselle, who was elected a Council member and President in 1993, only the second Council member from outside Charlottesville. Tanselle served as president of the society 1993-2006. Studies in Bibliography and other publications The Papers of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia was started in 1948 as an annual journal dedicated to the study of books as physical objects and to textual criticism and scholarly editing; Bowers served as the journal's editor until his death in 1991. It was renamed Studies in Bibliography for volume 2. Bowers conceived of the journal as one that encompassed all bibliographical study, with no restriction as to the geographical origins or periods or genres of the material examined. The topics of articles in Volume I (1948-1949), for instance, ranged from an unpublished manuscript by Thomas Jefferson, Elizabethan drama, and the use of watermarks as bibliographical evidence to catalogs issued by 16th century booksellers.Papers Volume I Volume III (1950) opened with four major essays on textual matters: R. C. Bald's \\"Editorial Problems--A Preliminary Survey,\\" W. W. Greg's \\"The Rationale of Copy-Text,\\" Bowers's \\"Some Relations of Bibliography to Editorial Problems,\\" and Archibald A. Hill's \\"Some Postulates for Distributional Study of Texts.\\" Papers Volume III G. Thomas Tanselle called Greg's article \\"one of the most seminal papers in the history of English scholarship.\\" Articles in later issues also discussed new technology, such as the Hinman collator, which used lenses and mirrors to compare copies of a printed work in order to show the differences. Bowers promoted this technique for early printed works, such as the First Folios of Shakespeare. Book length publications range from bibliographies of contemporary authors such as Peter Taylor and Hilda Doolittle (H.D.), to studies of Shakespearean promptbooks, with an especially large number of works on the problems and theory of textual editing, including collections of essays by Bowers and Tanselle.Print Publications In 1991, editorship of Studies in Bibliography passed to David L. Vander Meulen, a professor of English at the University of Virginia.  References   * retrieved December 28, 2014.

Sant Charandas was a major Hindu religious teacher in Delhi during the eighteenth century. Biography First called Ranjit Singh, Charandas was born in Derha, near Alwar, in Rajasthan in 1706. His family belonged to the Dhusar caste (merchant class). While still a child, Ranjit claimed to have had a vision of the divine sage Shukdev, the perpetually youthful son of Vyasa. Following the disappearance of his father, Murlidhar, when he was about twelve, Ranjit and his mother moved to live with relatives in Delhi. As a teenager, Ranjit spent periods meditating in the forest. He claimed to have met Shukdev again at the age of nineteen, and that Shukdev formally initiated him into the ascetic life, giving him the name Shyam Charandas - \\"servant of the feet of Krishna\\". Charandas then passed some fourteen years in isolation, practicing yoga and devotional worship, living in a cave in the wilderness outside Delhi in a place that now is called Fatehpur-Beri of the Chhattarpur locality of Mehrauli Delhi near the Qutub Minar. In 1738, Charandas began accepting followers in Delhi and continued teaching there for the rest of his life, with periodical trips into the countryside. He was succeeded to his spiritual seat (Guru- Gaddi) by his cousin sisters of his Dhusar community of Alwar, the Saints Sahjo Bai and Daya Bai. Sahjobai's verses were read and liked widespread all over India from Dehli to Gujarat. Little is known of this Charandasiya sect of Vaishnava mendicants that had echoed the Bhakti period saints of India during the Mughal era of Akbar and Jahangir. Charandas died in 1782. Teachings Charandas is the author of around twenty works. Many of these are in verse and deal with aspects of devotion, particularly relating to the worship of Krishna. He is credited by his followers with a vision of Krishna while on pilgrimage to Vraj in mid-life, as well as a further meeting with Shukdev at the same time. He wrote commentaries on various Upanishads, particularly the Katha Upanishad, and on specific yoga practices, especially Pranayama, control of the breath. A member of the Sant mystical tradition, Charandas's teachings draw on a wide range of sources and emphasize the nearness of the Divine to each person, the need to follow a guru, the importance of sharing in a community of like-minded believers not dependent on caste (Satsang), and the value of leading a strictly moral life. Two of his major disciples, Sahjo Bai and Daya Bai, both women, are also famous for their poetry.

The Klamath tribe along with the Flathead, Menominee, Potawatomi, and Turtle Mountain Chippewa, as well as all tribes in the states of California, New York, Florida, and Texas were targeted for immediate termination by House Concurrent Resolution 108 of 1953. The statement which was issued 1 August 1953 by the United States Congress announced the official beginning of the federal Indian termination policy.http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol6/html_files/v6p0614.html The tribes that were listed as being ready for immediate termination had been placed on a list prepared by acting Commissioner of Indian Affairs, William Zimmerman, because they met four primary criteria: adequate resources, they had adopted to a certain degree the cultural traits of the larger American culture, they were willing to terminate federal trust obligations, and the state was willing to assume jurisdiction over their criminal and civil matters.  Background  In the 1950s, the Klamath tribe in Oregon was one of the strongest and wealthiest tribes in the nation. They had created a vigorous economy based on timber resources and imported livestock, which nearly fully supported the entire tribe. The Klamath tribe was not a burden to the Oregon taxpayers, and was the only tribe in the country paying its share of BIA administrative costs. However, despite appearances, 82% of the tribe members living \\"on\\" the reservation had no jobs and most still engaged in hunting and fishing for subsistence. As for acculturation, although Klamath students were enrolled in public high schools, only 10 graduated between 1934 and 1947 and in the mid-1950s more than half of the Klamath students enrolled did not pass to the next grade. Though the Klamath who lived \\"off\\" the reservation were more prepared for living in the mainstream society, the occupants of the reservation had no concept of rent, utility payments, taxes, banking or even how they would meet their dietary needs.  Termination  In spite of testimony and evidence given, the Klamath tribe was terminated under the Klamath Termination Act, or Public Law 587, enacted on August 13, 1954. Under this act, all federal supervision over Klamath lands, as well as federal aid provided to the Klamath because of their special status as Indians, was ended. The legislation required each tribal member to choose between remaining a member of the tribe, or withdrawing and receiving a monetary payment for the value of the individual share of tribal land.Wilkinson, Charles. Blood Struggle: The Rise of Modern Indian Nations'. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2005 Those who stayed became members of a tribal management plan. This plan became a trust relationship between tribal members and the United States National Bank in Portland, Oregon.Hood, Susan, The Termination of the Klamath Indian Tribe of Oregon', The American Society for Ethnohistory, 1972 Of the 2,133 members of the Klamath tribe at the time of termination, 1,660 decided to withdraw from the tribe and accept individual payments for land. Oregon Senator Richard L. Neuberger, and Oregon Representative Albert Ullman, worked together to delay implementation of the Klamath termination law until hearings with the Indians were held and amendments could be made. In spite of testimony from experts, BIA officials and tribe members, the Klamath were terminated in 1961 as a result of constant pressure by Republican Senator Arthur V. Watkins.  Modoc Controversy  The termination of the Klamath Reservation, in actuality included three distinct but affiliated tribes. The Act defines the members as the \\"Klamath and Modoc Tribes and the Yahooskin Band of Snake Indians, and of the individual members thereof\\". A portion of the Modoc Tribe, had been taken as prisoners to Indian Territory in 1873 following the Modoc War in Oregon. Later, they were placed on a reservation in Indian Territory and their lands were allotted as were other tribes to make way for statehood for Oklahoma. In 1909, the US Congress passed an Act allowing those Modocs to return to their traditional home in Oregon and take up residence on the Klamath Reservation. Some returned, and some remained in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, where they had now established homes and ties. In 1965, as a part of the US settlement with the Klamath reservation, a series of hearings were held from April to August. At the hearings, testimony was heard regarding the notice given to the western Modoc at the time of the termination of the Klamath Reservation. William Randall, Representative from Missouri's 5th District, observed on 13 May 1965 that he had reviewed notices that appeared in the Federal Register between 14 January 1955 and 12 August 1961 regarding the Klamath termination and none mentioned the Modoc. His and other testimony presented at the hearing made it clear that many western Modoc had not registered for the final roll, were unaware that the Klamath termination applied to them, and felt that they should not be excluded from claim reparations due by the United States to the tribe as a whole for historic breaches. The hearings concluded without allowing the Oklahoma Modoc to be included in the rolls of the Klamath Tribe.  Hunting and Fishing Rights  Termination led to lawsuits, as individual Klamath Indians struggled to preserve treaty hunting and fishing rights. Five Klamath Indians who had withdrawn from the tribe after Public Law 587 claimed they retained hunting and fishing rights guaranteed to the Klamath tribe in the Treaty of October 16, 1854. After a U.S. district court ruled against them, they filed an appeal under Kimball v. Callahan. Based on reasoning similar to that in Menominee Tribe v. United States, the U.S. District Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit found that, since the Klamath Termination Act did not specifically abrogate Klamath hunting and fishing rights, these rights remained. The court looked at the stipulation in Public Law 280, providing that no state could deprive an Indian tribe (or individual members) of hunting and fishing rights guaranteed to them by federal treaty.Menominee Tribe of Indians v. United States, Certiorari to the U.S. Court of Claims, No. 187, 1968. (Transcript at Caselaw.lp)  Restoration  Within the tribe, termination had been supported only by a few who were loyal to Sen. Watkins. After being terminated, the tribe was cut off from services for education, health care, housing and related resources. Termination directly caused decay within the tribe including poverty, alcoholism, high suicide rates, low educational achievement, disintegration of the family, poor housing, high dropout rates from school, disproportionate numbers in penal institutions, increased infant mortality, decreased life expectancy, and loss of identity.Clements (2009), pp 47-62 Ironically, the western Modoc were restored to tribal status 15 May 1978, in an Act which reinstated the Modoc, Wyandotte, Peoria and Ottawa Tribes of Oklahoma.http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=92&page;=246 Almost a decade later, through the leadership and vision of the Klamath people, and the assistance of a few congressional leaders, the Klamath Restoration Act was adopted into law in 1986, reestablishing the Klamath as a sovereign state.

William Swan Plumer (July 26, 1802 – October 22, 1880) was an American clergyman, theologian and author who was recognized as an intellectual leader of the Presbyterian Church in the 1800s. Early life William S. Plumer was born to William and Catharine Plumer (née McAlester) in Greersburg, present day Darlington, Pennsylvania, on July 26, 1802. He graduated from Washington College (now Washington and Lee University in Virginia) in 1825, received his religious education at Princeton Theological Seminary in New Jersey, and was ordained in the Presbyterian Church. He was licensed in the Presbytery of New Brunswick, a Presbytery in New Jersey, as a clergyman in 1826, and the state's Orange Presbytery ordained him as an evangelist in 1827.http://www.thisday.pcahistory.org/tag/william-swan-plumer/ Career as clergyman Plumer was the minister of several churches during his career, most notably: First Presbyterian Church, Richmond, Virginia (1834–1846); Franklin Street Presbyterian Church, Baltimore, Maryland (1847–1854); Central Presbyterian Church, Allegheny, Pennsylvania (1854–1862); Arch Street Presbyterian Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1862–1865); and Second Presbyterian Church, Pottsville, Pennsylvania (1865–1867). From 1837 to 1845 Plumer was the editor of The Watchman of the South, a weekly Presbyterian newspaper which he had founded while serving as pastor in Richmond. He was also a founder of Staunton's Institution for the Blind, Deaf, & Dumb. Plumer moderated the General Assemblies of two different sects of American Presbyterianism, one in the Presbyterian Church of the United States of America in 1838 and in the Presbyterian Church in the United States in 1871. In both institutions he was a staunch supporter of Old School Presbyterianism. Career as educator Plumer as depicted in 1884's Encyclopedia of the Presbyterian Church. In addition to his career in the pulpit, Plumer was a highly regarded religious instructor, and his teaching positions included: Professor at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania (1854–1862); Professor of Didactic and Polemic Theology (1867–1875) at Columbia Theological Seminary in South Carolina; and Professor of Pastoral, Casuistic, and Historical Theology (1875–1880) at Columbia. Career as author Plumer authored at least 25 books, including commentaries on Romans, Hebrews, and Psalms, as well as numerous tracts and pamphlets, and magazine and newspaper articles. Many of his articles were published anonymously, so the number of writings he produced cannot be calculated with accuracy. Death and burial Plumer died in Baltimore on October 22, 1880, due to complications which arose after having surgery to remove kidney stones. He was buried at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. Family In 1829 Plumer married a widow, Eliza Garden Hassell, in Hillsboro, North Carolina. She died in 1878 and is also buried at Hollywood Cemetery. Honors Plumer was the recipient of several honorary degrees, including: three Doctors of Divinity (D.D.) (Washington & Lee, Lafayette College, and Washington & Jefferson College); and one LL.D. (University of Mississippi).

Funds which had been raised by public subscription for the purchase of a battleship were diverted to establish the Dreadnought Scheme when the Commonwealth instead decided to build an Australian Navy. On arrival in Australia, the teenage boys were assigned to a state government farm for three months of agricultural training. More than half of the boys who participated in the scheme were sent to the Scheyville Farm. Here the boys learnt skills such as shearing, horse riding, cropping, dairying, butchering and farm equipment maintenance. On completion of the training period the boys could be sent to work on any farm in the state. Most of the Dreadnought graduates were employed on dairy farms in the Northern Rivers area. The scheme was put on hold during World War I. During the war the farm was used briefly for the detainment of 87 German citizens who had been taken from boats moored in Sydney Harbour. Later, the farm was used to train Australian women in agricultural skills while men were at war. The scheme resumed in 1921 but in 1930 was again stopped, this time as a result of the Great Depression. By this time 4,500 British boys had been trained at Scheyville. During the Depression the Scheyville Farm took about 500 Australian city boys annually and gave them four months of training in basic farming practices. The boys were found suitable positions on farms on completion of their training. The Scheyville Training Farm era ended in 1940 when the farm was taken over by the Commonwealth for use as a military school during World War II.

It was installed in the town centre of Sutton in Greater London, England in 1981. Appearance The statue features a horse and nude young male rider, created in bronze with very dark patination. It is located directly outside the main entrance to Quadrant House (in the Quadrant), adjacent to Sutton railway station. The horse, with a slightly raised left leg, looks towards the station. The boy-rider, seated bareback, raises his left hand in the air above his head and his right hand to his mouth, as if calling out. It is fully life-size and mounted on a 7-foot plinth of marble and granite slabs. The total height is 150 inches.Public Monuments and Sculpture Association Development The statue was commissioned by the then Business Press International Ltd, and upkeep of the work now falls to Reed Business Information, who occupy Quadrant House. It was a major commission for Wynne, which took four years from his first idea and inspiration on receipt of the brief through roughing out, refining and foundry to the final unveiling and installation. The brief given to him by the company was to illustrate the fundamental business of the company, namely communication, but to convey the idea, rather than simply to represent the work of the company in a direct or very obvious way. Wynne had to consider what actual form the sculpture would take to best capture the idea of communication. When inspiration came to him, it did so \\"like a flash of light, complete\\", as he put it: View of the statue showing the rider calling out As part of his preparation, Wynne visited Italy to see the Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius in Rome and the Horses of Saint Mark in Venice. In his introductory essay in the book The Messenger, Lucius Noël notes Wynne's dislike for statues where the horse is shown as merely the support for the rider. Noël notes the way that Wynne highlights the interrelationship between horse and rider in the work, as he did in his previous two horse and rider sculptures. While noting the greater reality in the work than its two equestrian predecessors, he stresses the strong symbolism in the work. He writes: Noël notes how this analysis ties in with Wynne's wider views about animals, saying \\"We must share the Earth with the animals, who have as much right to it as we do. To find a way to live in peace with the animals is our duty.\\". Location The statue in situ The company had initially considered that the work should be installed high up, above the entrance lobby. However, Wynne advised against this, feeling that the distance created would militate against the engagement he wanted people to have with the work. It would be perceived as two-dimensional, depriving people of the full three-dimensions they would feel by walking around it. So the statue was installed at ground level in front of the entrance to the building, enabling people to get close up to it.

They were originally made from natural dried flowers (which lasted longer than fresh flowers) or could be made from artificial materials such as china and painted plaster of paris or beads strung on wire arrangements. Unless made of a highly durable material (e.g. china), they would often be enclosed in a glass container (known as globes) to protect them from the weather. In some cases, they were embedded into the grave itself (e.g. on the concrete over the grave) while others were merely placed on or by the grave. Immortelles, from Life on the Mississippi by Mark Twain, 1883 In Life on the Mississippi, Mark Twain comments on burial practices in New Orleans: \\"They bury their dead in vaults, above the ground. ... Fresh flowers, in vases of water, are to be seen at the portals of many of the vaults: placed there by the pious hands of bereaved parents and children, husbands and wives, and renewed daily. A milder form of sorrow finds its inexpensive and lasting remembrancer in the coarse and ugly but indestructible 'immortelle'—which is a wreath or cross or some such emblem, made of rosettes of black linen, with sometimes a yellow rosette at the conjunction of the cross's bars—kind of sorrowful breast-pin, so to say. The immortelle requires no attention: you just hang it up, and there you are; just leave it alone, it will take care of your grief for you, and keep it in mind better than you can; stands weather first-rate, and lasts like boiler- iron.\\" Immortelle, Allora Cemetery, 2015 Immortelles were popular in Australia in the early 20th century. Being more expensive than fresh flowers, immortelles were normally left on graves by close family. They were purchased from undertakers. In recent times, plastic flowers have replaced immortelles as a long-lasting flower arrangement for use with graves. Therefore, immortelles will mostly only be seen on older graves.

It started at the Louisiana state line and traveled northwest. The route ended at MS 48, east of Tylertown. MS 577 was designated in 1957, and was removed from the state highway system ten years later. Route description As of 1965, all of the route was in Walthall County. The route started at the Louisiana state line, where Louisiana Highway 62 (LA 62) ended. MS 577 quickly turned northwest on Old State Line Road. The route continued to travel in the same direction until it reached Old Settlement Road, where it bent westward, then northward. MS 577 then turned north onto Dexter Road, and continued to shift west. It ends at MS 48 at a T-intersection, about from the state line. MS 577 is maintained by the Mississippi State Highway Commission, as part of the state highway system. History The road that became MS 577 first appeared on maps in 1956.

Melendez was injured in an IED attack that cost him his left leg in Baghdad, Iraq in 2006.  Early life  Growing up in New York City, Melendez felt compelled by the events of 9/11, and enlisted the military at 17 years old, serving as an Infantryman. While serving in Iraq, an improvised explosive device (IED) struck his platoon. Melendez sustained multiple life-threatening injuries, including the loss of his left leg. Combat Medics struggled to resuscitate him three times, before he was stabilized. As a result, Melendez was awarded a Purple Heart, and began physical rehabilitation at Brooke Army Medical Center. He is of Puerto Rican descent. In 2009, Melendez began working in film and television production as a Motion Picture Studio Mechanic. He went on to work on film sets for Tyler Perry, The Smurfs, A Late Quartet and television shows such as Law and Order and Person of Interest.  Professional wrestling career  Melendez began training at a small professional wrestling school in Brooklyn, New York called The Doghouse. Melendez was then introduced to Total Nonstop Action wrestlers Ken Anderson (a former Army veteran himself) and Bully Ray through the Wounded Warrior Project. They were impressed by Melendez's physical conditioning and attitude. Inspired by Melendez's story and his passion, Ray offered for himself and longtime tag team partner Devon to train Chris at the Team 3D Academy of Professional Wrestling in Kissimmee, Florida if he would drop everything and take the leap of faith. Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2014–2016) Melendez made his in-ring debut in his hometown of New York City on August 5, 2014, where he defeated The BroMans member DJ Z. On September 17, 2014 at No Surrender, Chris Melendez defeated Kenny King. MVP and Kenny King offered Melendez to join them. After Melendez declined, King berated Melendez for refusing to join them. King attacked and referred to Melendez as a “peg leg.” King then demanded a referee. MVP's distractions, allowed Kenny King to strike from behind as the bell sounded. King dominated the match, capitalizing on his pre-match antics. King’s rampage continues, but Melendez capitalized and scores the pinfall with a reversal. Melendez teamed with Mr. Anderson, joining in the pursuit of the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On the October 22, edition of Impact Wrestling, MVP and Kenny King defeated Anderson and Melendez in the first round of the TNA tag team number one contender tournament. Chris hit King with a Fisherman’s Suplex. MVP then interfered and Mr. Anderson rushed back into the ring. MVP charged toward Anderson, but Melendez blindsides MVP and sends him out of the ring. Kenny King sneaks in with a roll-up and a fistful of tights for the win. During the November 19 Impact Wrestling, Melendez defeated Kenny King via disqualification. King attempted a springboard attack but, Melendez used his prosthetic leg, and caught him with a big boot. Melendez connected with a Fisherman’s Suplex, then hoisted King onto his shoulders – MVP then interfered, viciously attacking him with a chair, causing King's disqualification leading to a hiatus from TNA. Melendez returned to television on the February 20, 2015 taping of Impact Wrestling taking part in a 20-man gauntlet in which he was eliminated by Bram. On March 17, episode of Xplosion, Melendez and Mr. Anderson (accompanied by Bully Ray) defeated The BroMans (accompanied by DJ Z and The Beautiful People). On September 23, Melendez finally defeated Eric Young in a lumberjack match to get his prosthetic leg back. On January 5–7, 2016 and March 17, 2016, he wrestled his final matches with TNA Wrestling in a losing effort in the feast or fired match, losing to Eric Young at TNA Rival 2016 and winning against Beauregarde at TNA Victory Road 2016. On June 15, 2016, Melendez announced his departure from TNA.  Personal life Melendez has a son, born in 2014.

While serving as a deputy in Trabzon, he was a witness to the Armenian Genocide. His testimony of the event is considered by genocide scholar Vahakn Dadrian as one of the \\"rarest corroborations of the fact of the complicity of governmental officials in the organization of the mass murder of Armenians\\". He was sentenced to death after the Izmir trials of 1926, charged with attempting to assassinate Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.  Early life  Hafız Mehmet was born in the Ottoman Empire in the village of Sürmene located near Trabzon in 1874. He was the son of Hacı Yakubzâde Ahmed Ağa. He received his early education in local schools near Trabzon. Mehmet moved to Istanbul to study law, where he ultimately attained a degree in law. He served as a lawyer throughout the Ottoman Empire. In the 1912 and 1914 Young Turk elections, Hafız Mehmet was elected as a deputy who represented Trabzon. As a practicing lawyer, Mehmet was nicknamed \\"hukukcu\\" or lawyer.  Armenian Genocide witness  Hafız Mehmet served as a deputy in Trabzon, where an estimated 50,000 Armenians were killed during the Armenian Genocide. Since Trabzon was a coastal city of the Black Sea, the method employed to kill was mainly mass drowning. Hafız Mehmet witnessed such drownings of Armenians off the coast of Ordu, near Trabzon, and provided testimony of his eyewitness accounts during a 21 December 1918 parliamentary session of the Chamber of Deputies: The city of Ordu during the Ottoman era Hafız Mehmet stated that he and other deputies knew beforehand that the Young Turk government had an underlying aim to exterminate the Armenian population. He also said that those tasked to carry out the responsibility were members of the Special Organization, a special task force under the auspices of the imperial Ottoman government, but that these individuals received orders directly from Cemal Azmi, the governor of the Trabzon province. Mehmet testified that he attempted to stop the massacres by trying to speak with Interior Minister Talat Pasha directly but that Talat never responded to his inquiries and never questioned the actions of the politicians in Trabzon. Hafız Mehmet's testimony is considered by genocide scholar Vahakn Dadrian as a representation of the \\"rarest corroborations of the fact of the complicity of governmental officials in the organization of the mass murder of the Armenians.\\" Others have provided similar testimonies including Oscar S. Heizer, the American consul at Trabzon, who reported that \\"many of the children were loaded into boats and taken out to sea and thrown overboard.\\" The Italian consul of Trabzon in 1915, Giacomo Gorrini also wrote: \\"I saw thousands of innocent women and children placed on boats which were capsized in the Black Sea\\".  Later life and death  Hafız Mehmet was sentenced to death after the Izmir trials of 1926. The trials condemned thirty-six individuals for attempting to assassinate Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.

The band was established by guitarist Tom Flynn, bassist Brian Beattie, Jason Weinberg (drums) and Wayne Zito (guitar). Despite only being active for one year, their sole 7\\" release, \\"Break My Face\\" has gone on to be influential and a prized collector's item. Biography Tapeworm was formed in 1978 by Tom Flynn, Brian Beattie, Jason Weinberg, and Wayne Zito; all classmates at Rippowam High School. After practicing as a band, the name was chosen after they saw a bassist in a cover band with a Tapeworm sticker on his bass. Flynn, Beattie, and Weinberg were all previously in a jazz standard band in 1977. Tapeworm combined the diverse genres of each member; Flynn favored hard rock bands, such as Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith, Beattie and Weinberg preferred jazz, while Zito was a fan of metal. Zito wrote one of their first songs, \\"The Spider of the City\\", while they also added various Ramones songs to their setlist. The band's most notable performance came on March 31, 1978 at the Rippowam Talent Show. The band performed Flynn's explosive original song, \\"Break My Face\\", along with the Ramones' \\"Cretin Hop\\" and \\"Rockaway Beach\\" before a raving audience. Zito bought a cheap guitar for the event, and smashed it during the first song. The band eventually lost to performers singing \\"Don't Know Much About History\\". A video of break my face live at the talent show can be seen on Youtube. The band started to dissolve after the members graduated from high school. First, drummer Jason Weinberg left for college in the fall. He was replaced by Doug Karger, while Scott Fletcher took over vocal duties. This new lineup was now billed as Safety Patrol (another drummer, Scott Marcus, joined later on). They achieved local success, and played shows at CBGB's before folding. Legacy In the years following, the band members remained in touch. In college, Weinberg played in a few various, short-lived bands including \\"Alpo\\" and \\"MX and the Cruise Missiles\\". The other members moved to the Bay Area to continue their musical endeavors. Fletcher started a band called \\"Sinequan\\", while Flynn and Beattie both started the band called \\"Fang\\" in 1980. Breaking up after touring the country, Beattie moved to Texas and founded Glass Eye, while Flynn stayed with Fang until the band turned into hardcore legends. Afterwards, Flynn started the band \\"Star Pimp\\". Break My Face Following the band's talent show performance, they went on to put out a single. They chose Ray Cipri (who goes by the stage name Ray Sunshine) for the task, as he had previously put out his own single, \\"Country Fine Sally\\" on Touch Records the previous year and the only person in town with recording equipment. The band went in to record four tracks in Sunshine's residence from May 7 to May 8. Three tracks were put on the single including an intro to \\"Blues For An Insurance Salesman\\", which involves the band playing instruments they don't know how to play in an ode to Charles Ives. The recording session also has something on it called \\"Fuzz Bassolo\\" which has never been released. In all, 200 copies were put out, mainly given to friends and family, or sold at Discount Records. After years of obscurity, the single finally became known to a wider audience after the tracks \\"Break My Face\\" and \\"Blues For An Insurance Salesman\\" were featured on Killed By Death Volume #9 in 1995. In 2001, the single was bootlegged and reissued on Kablooey Records, including the original intro to \\"Blues For An Insurance Salesman\\". Today, very few of the original records have turned up, and they remain highly valued. The single has been re-issued on Death Vault Records. The original master tapes from 1978 were baked and dubbed allowing it to be re-engineered to prepare it for this vinyl re-issue. 500 copies were pressed.

Uytendaal was born in Holland in 1931 and immigrated to Australia in January, 1956. He was one of seventeen living children, coming from an equestrian family in Breda, Holland. Because he was made professional in his homeland, he decided to spend two years in Australia as an assisted migrant, returning as an amateur, but ended up staying for a lifetime. He was one of the first riders to use the 'European' style in Australia and introduced dressage as the basis of show jumping. From 1956 to 1990 Art's list of wins numbered into the thousands in Australia. He was the first sponsored rider in the country -Kevin Dennis Show Jumping Team and also Johnny Walker Whisky. The list of wins includes three Australian Show Jumping Championships, Victorian Championships, Showjumper of the Year awards, and many Puissance records. Some of his well-known horses, that he made or rode were Solo, Bencubbin, Donald, Madison Square, Powder, Trafalgar Square, Leal, Chatter, Gentleman, Brahmin, Tongala, Jamaica Inn, Mr. Kevin, Mr. Dennis, Wanganella, Autograph, Koyuna, Dixieland, Johnny Walker Whisky, Mr. Ed, Duell Bug, Duell Roy and Man of Gold (who competed for Japan at the Sydney Olympics.) He was the first to jump 1 m 93 cm (6' 4\\") in a Puissance in Australia and in 1969 he jumped 2 m 17 cm (7' 1½\\") on Chatter, a record he held for many years until the rules were changed and the wall could include hay bales in front of it. He would have qualified to ride at five Olympic Games, but being professional he was ineligible. Two of his horses, Mr. Dennis finished 5th at the Montreal Olympics ridden by Guy Creighton, and Autograph ridden by Geoff McVean finished 4th at the alternate Olympics in Rotterdam. His first wife Marianne Uytendaal (later Gilchrist) was also an accomplished rider representing Australia on numerous occasions. In 1976 he took two young horses to the UK - Tongala and Jamaica Inn where they both won and placed in shows, qualifying for the Horse of the Year Show, but unfortunately Art was injured and returned home.

Life and career  Mandal joined the University of Allahabad as an exploration assistant in 1960. He rose to become a Professor and retired in 1993. Even though he has never received a PhD, he has supervised several Ph. D. students. Mandal is a card- holding member of the Communist Party of India.

Ratnagar, Tulika Books, 2007), .  Ayodhya dispute  Mandal came to prominence with the publication of his book Ayodhya: Archaeology after Demolition in 1994. The book was written in response to two pieces of evidence. In 1990, the archaeologist B. B. Lal had announced that he had discovered pillar bases during his excavation in Ayodhya during 1975-80, next to the Babri Masjid site. This implied that there was another structure, presumably a temple, under the Babri Masjid, and gave rise to considerable consternation among the secularist academic groups. Secondly, after the demolition of Babri Masjid by the Vishva Hindu Parishad and allied groups in 1992, a number of figures and artifacts were discovered in the debris, which formed the basis for a booklet by Y. D. Sharma et al. Mandal's book was a critique of these two pieces of evidence. Of the pillar bases discovered by B. B. Lal, Mandal wrote that they were not aligned with one another and that they belonged to different cultural levels. At the World Archaeology Congress in 1998, Mandal stated that what were thought to be pillar bases were actually part of a wall, despite his prior assertion that they were not in alignment and belonged to different cultural levels. In an article in the New Age magazine in 1999, he also stated that the Gahadavala inscription found in the Babri Masjid debris, attesting to a Vishnu Hari temple, did not fall from the walls of the mosque and it was possibly brought in from elsewhere. The book was reissued as Ayodhya, Archaeology after Excavation in 2007, along with an introduction and afterword contributed by Shereen Ratnagar. By this time, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) had conducted an excavation at the Babri Masjid site, as directed by the Allahabad High Court, and submitted its report. Mandal and Ratnagar had also received permission from the Court to visit the excavation site. In the 2007 version of the book, Mandal and Ratnagar added a critique of the ASI excavations and its report. They stated that the ASI did not record the strata at which architectural finds were found and that the pieces of glazed pottery, glazed tiles and animal bones found at the site, which could be dated to the Sultanate period, were \\"suppressed.\\" Mandal contended that his analysis of stratigraphy led him to conclude that two significant floods took place during the 4th to 6th centuries AD, resulting in the abandonment of the site until the 13th century AD. This meant, according to him, that it was impossible for a 10th-century shrine and an 11th or 12th century temple to have existed at the same site. On the whole, Mandal and Ratnagar claimed to have found \\"clinching archaeological evidence\\" that there was no temple under the mosque. However, when Mandal appeared as an expert witness for the Sunni Waqf Board in the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi case at the Allahabad High Court, the Court found that \\"the statements made by him in cross examination show[ed] the shallowness of his knowledge in the subject.\\". He had stated that he never visited Ayodhya prior to 2003. He did not make any examination of the black basalt columns that were part of the mosque. In fact, he claimed that his study did not involve examining the structure above the ground. He stuck to his claim that the stratigraphy and conclusion in the ASI Report were wrong, based on his observation about floods. However, the Court noted that, on p. 156 of his book, he had stated that there was no evidence of floods between 600 AD and 1200 AD. So, they could not have affected the 10th-12th century constructions. His statement reflected \\"total confusion on his part,\\" according to the Court. On the whole, the Court found, \\"the entire opinion of this witness is short of the requirement under Section 45 of the Evidence Act 1872 to qualify as an Expert.\\" Both Mandal and Ratnagar were held in contempt of court by the Allahabad High Court for having discussed the ASI report in public while the matter was sub judice.

Building Performance Evaluation Programme: Findings from non-domestic projects - Getting the best from buildings. London: Innovate UK. Page 12 There are established tools for reducing the performance gap, by reviewing project objectives, outline and detailed design drawings, design calculations, implementation of designs on site, and post-occupancy evaluation. NEF's Assured Performance Process (APP) is one such tool, which is being used extensively on different sites that form part of East Hampshire's Whitehill and Bordon new town development, one of the largest regeneration projects anywhere in the UK, with high ambitions for both environmental performance and health. Classification of factors that contribute to the performance gap The performance gap is produced mainly due to uncertainties. Uncertainties are found in any “real-world” system, and buildings are no exception. As early as 1978, Gero and Dudnik wrote a paper presenting a methodology to solve the problem of designing subsystems (HVAC) subjected to uncertain demands. After that, other authors have shown an interest in the uncertainties that are present in building design; Ramallo-González classified uncertainties in building design/construction in three different groups:Ramallo-González, A.P. 2013. Modelling Simulation and Optimisation of Low-energy Buildings. PhD. University of Exeter. # Environmental. Uncertainty in weather prediction under changing climate; and uncertain weather data information due to the use of synthetic weather data files: (1) use of synthetic years that do not represent a real year, and (2) use of a synthetic year that has not been generated from recorded data in the exact location of the project but in the closest weather station. # Workmanship and quality of building elements. Differences between the design and the real building: Conductivity of thermal bridges, conductivity of insulation, value of infiltration or U-Values of walls and windows. There may be optimism bias by designers, where expectations about what is possible on site are unrealistic, and/or buildability fails to get adequate attention during design. # Behavioural. All other parameters linked to human behaviour i.e. door and window opening, heating regimesHughes, M; Palmer, J; Pope, P; Armitage, P. 2016. UK Housing Stock Models Using SAP: The Case for Heating Regime Change. Science Journal of Engineering 4 (2) 12-22., use of appliances, occupancy patterns or cooking habits. Type 1: Environmental uncertainties The type 1 from this grouping, have been divided here into two main groups: one concerning the uncertainty due to climate change; and the other concerning uncertainties due to the use of synthetic weather data files. Concerning the uncertainties due to climate change: buildings have long life spans, for example, in England and Wales, around 40% of the office blocks existing in 2004 were built before 1940 (30% if considered by floor area).ODPM, 2005. Age of Commercial and Industrial Stock: Local Authority Level 2004. London: Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. and, 38.9% of English dwellings in 2007 were built before 1944.CLG, 2007. English House Condition Survey 2007, Annual report. Communities and Local Government This long life span makes buildings likely to operate with climates that might change due to global warming. De Wilde and Coley showed how important is to design buildings that take into consideration climate change and that are able to perform well in future weathers.de Wilde, P. & Coley, D., 2012. The implications of a changing climate for buildings. Building and Environment, 55, pp.1-7 Concerning the uncertainties due to the use of synthetic weather data files: Wang et al. showed the impact that uncertainties in weather data (among others) may cause in energy demand calculations.Wang, L., Mathew, P. & Pang, X., 2012. Uncertainties in energy consumption introduced by building operations and weather for a medium-size office building. Energy and Buildings, 53, pp.152-158 The deviation in calculated energy use due to variability in the weather data were found to be different in different locations from a range of (-0.5% – 3%) in San Francisco to a range of (-4% to 6%) in Washington D.C. The ranges were calculated using TMY as the reference. These deviations on the demand were smaller than the ones due to operational parameters. For those, the ranges were (-29% – 79%) for San Francisco and (-28% – 57%) for Washington D.C. The operation parameters were those linked with occupants’ behaviour. The conclusion of this paper is that occupants will have a larger impact in energy calculations than the variability between synthetically generated weather data files. The spatial resolution of weather data files was the concern covered by Eames et al.Eames, M., Kershaw, T. & Coley, D., 2011. The appropriate spatial resolution of future weather files for building simulation. Journal of Building Performance Simulation, 5, pp.1-12 Eames showed how a low spatial resolution of weather data files can be the cause of disparities of up to 40% in the heating demand. Type 2: Workmanship In the work of Pettersen, uncertainties of group 2 (workmanship and quality of elements) and group 3 (behaviour) of the previous grouping were considered (Pettersen, 1994). This work shows how important occupants’ behaviour is on the calculation of the energy demand of a building. Pettersen showed that the total energy use follows a normal distribution with a standard deviation of around 7.6% when the uncertainties due to occupants are considered, and of around 4.0% when considering those generated by the properties of the building elements. A large study was carried out by Leeds Metropolitan at Stamford Brook. This project saw 700 dwellings built to high efficiency standards.Wingfield, J., Bell, M., Miles-Shenton, D., South, T. & Lowe, B., 2011. Evaluating the impact of an enhanced energy performance standard on load-bearing masonry domestic construction, Understanding the gap between designed and real performance: Lessons from Stamford Brook. London: Department for Communities and Local Government The results of this project show a significant gap between the energy used expected before construction and the actual energy use once the house is occupied. The workmanship is analysed in this work. The authors emphasise the importance of thermal bridges that were not considered for the calculations, and how those originated by the internal partitions that separate dwellings have the largest impact on the final energy use. The dwellings that were monitored in use in this study show a large difference between the real energy use and that estimated using SAP, with one of them giving +176% of the expected value when in use. Hopfe has published several papers concerning uncertainties in building design that cover workmanship. A more recent publication at the time of writing Hopfe, C.J. & Hensen, J.L.M., 2011. Uncertainty analysis in building performance simulation for design support. Energy and Buildings, 43, pp.2798-2805 looks into uncertainties of group 2 and 3. In this work the uncertainties are defined as normal distributions. The random parameters are sampled to generate 200 tests that are sent to the simulator (VA114), the results from which will be analysed to check the uncertainties with the largest impact on the energy calculations. This work showed that the uncertainty in the value used for infiltration is the factor that is likely to have the largest influence on cooling and heating demands. Another study performed by de Wilde and Wei Tian,de Wilde, P. & Tian, W., 2009. Identification of key factors for uncertainty in the prediction of the thermal performance of an office building under climate change. Building Simulation, 2, pp.157-174 compared the impact of most of the uncertainties affecting building energy calculations taking into account climate change. De Wilde and Tian used a two dimensional Monte Carlo Analysis to generate a database obtained with 7280 runs of a building simulator. A sensitivity analysis was applied to this database to obtain the most significant factors on the variability of the energy demand calculations. Standardised Regression Coefficients and Standardised Rank Regression Coefficients were used to compare the impacts of the uncertainties. De Wilde and Tian agreed with Hopfe on the impact of uncertainties in the infiltration over energy calculations, but also introduced other factors, including uncertainties in: weather, U-Value of windows, and other variables related with occupants’ behaviour (equipment and lighting). Their paper compares many of the uncertainties with a good sized database providing a realistic comparison for the scope of the sampling of the uncertainties. The work of Schnieders and Hermelink Schnieders, J. & Hermelink, A., 2006. CEPHEUS results: measurements and occupants’ satisfaction provide evidence for Passive Houses being an option for sustainable building. Energy Policy, 34, pp.151-171 showed a substantial variability in the energy demands of low-energy buildings designed under the same specification (Passivhaus). Type 3: Occupants The work of Schnieders and Hermelink Schnieders, J. & Hermelink, A., 2006. CEPHEUS results: measurements and occupants’ satisfaction provide evidence for Passive Houses being an option for sustainable building. Energy Policy, 34, pp.151-171 showed a substantial variability in the energy demands of low-energy buildings designed under the same specification (Passivhaus). Although the passivhaus standard has a very controlled, high quality workmanship, large differences have been seen in energy demand in different houses. Blight and Coley Blight, T.S., Coley D. A., 2012 The impact of occupant behaviour on the energy consumption of low-energy dwellings, 2nd Conference on Building Energy and Environment. Boulder, USA showed that that variability can be occasioned due to variance in occupant behaviour (the use of windows and doors was included in this work). The work of Blight and Coley proves two things: (1) Occupants have a substantial influence on energy use; and (2) The model they used to generate occupants’ behaviour is accurate for the creation of behavioural patterns of inhabitants. The method used in the previous paper Blight, T.S., Coley D. A., 2012 The impact of occupant behaviour on the energy consumption of low-energy dwellings, 2nd Conference on Building Energy and Environment. Boulder, USA to generate accurate profiles of occupants’ behaviour was the one developed by Richardson et al.Richardson, I., Thomson, M. & Infield, D., 2008. A high-resolution domestic building occupancy model for energy demand simulations. Energy and Buildings, 40, pp.1560-1566 The method was developed using the Time-Use Survey (TUS) of the United Kingdom as a reference of real behaviour of occupants, this database was elaborated after recording the activity of more than 6000 occupants in 24-hours diaries with a 10 minutes resolution . Richardson’s paper shows how the tool is able to generate behavioural patterns that correlate with the real data obtained from the TUS. The availability of this tool allows scientist’s to model the uncertainty of occupants’ behaviour as a set of behavioural patterns that have been proven to correlate with real occupants’ behaviour. There have been works published to take into account occupancy in optimisation using the so called robust optimisation Ramallo-González, A. P., Blight, T., Coley, D.

Hopkins.  Early life and education  Ann Branigar Hopkins was born in Galveston, Texas, the oldest of three children, but she and her siblings grew up in Germany. Her family moved around every few years, within both Europe and the U.S., as a result of her father's military service. Hopkins attended Hollins College in Virginia, earning a bachelor's degree in 1965. She continued on to Indiana University, where she completed a master's degree in mathematics in 1967.  Early career  Hopkins began her career in aerospace at IBM, where she created mathematical models that predicted the motions of scientific and weather satellites under various conditions. She eventually moved into project management, working for several smaller aerospace firms, but decided to leave the industry in search of a more financially stable career path. She wound up at the national accounting firm Touche Ross, where she met her husband, Tom Gallagher. Anti-nepotism rules at Touche Ross barred both Hopkins and her husband from consideration for partnership after they married, so Hopkins took a job at Price Waterhouse in 1978. Within five years, she had brought the firm more business than any other candidate for partnership.  Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins  In 1982, Hopkins was considered for partnership at Price Waterhouse. At the time, she was the senior manager at the firm's Office of Government Services. She was the only woman among 88 candidates for partnership. Despite her clear success in bringing business to the company, and high praise from other partners as an \\"outstanding professional\\" with a \\"strong character, independence, and integrity,\\" her candidacy was put on indefinite hold. She eventually resigned and sued the company for sex discrimination, arguing that her lack of promotion came after pressure to walk, talk, dress, and act more \\"femininely.\\" These requirements, she argued, would never have been made of a male colleague and violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Lower courts upheld Hopkins' claim, but the case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled 6-3 in 1989 that Price Waterhouse had, in fact, discriminated based on sex stereotypes. In his lead opinion, Justice William Brennan wrote, \\"An employer who objects to aggressiveness in women but whose positions require this trait places women in an intolerable and impermissible Catch-22: out of a job if they behave aggressively and out of a job if they don't.\\" A year after the Supreme Court ruling, a federal district judge awarded Hopkins the partnership she was originally denied at Price Waterhouse. By that time, Hopkins had moved on to the World Bank, where she worked as a senior budget officer. The judge also ordered Price Waterhouse to pay Hopkins between $300,000 and $400,000 in back pay. In an interview after the decision, Hopkins said of her case: \\"The explanation I got about why I didn't make partner didn't make sense to me. … I filed suit not because of the money, but because I had been given an irrational explanation for a bad business decision.\\"  Later career  After her landmark case, Hopkins returned to Price Waterhouse, where she worked until her retirement in 2002. The team she led became one of the most diverse and profitable in the company. Hopkins also wrote a book, So Ordered: Making Partner the Hard Way (University of Massachusetts Press, 1996), and began giving lectures on her experience.  Personal life  Hopkins' marriage to Gallagher ended in the mid-1980s and she raised their children, Tela, Gilbert, and Peter, as a single parent. She was a grandmother of five. Hopkins died in 2018.

Russia Russian Empire The Tsardom of Russia, Russian Empire, Soviet Union, capitalist and communist China performed many genocide actions against the Mongols (assimilate, reduce the population, extinguish the language, culture, tradition, history, religion and ethnic identity). During Imperial Russia, Tsar Peter the Great said: \\"The headwaters of the Yenisei River must be Russian land\\".L.Jamsran, Mongol states in Russia, 1995 Russian Empire sent the Kalmyks and Buryats to war to reduce the populations (World War I and other wars).  Soviet Russia  Soviet Russian scientists attempted to convince the Kalmyks and Buryats that they were not Mongols during the 20th century (demongolization policy). 35,000 Buryats were killed during the rebellion of 1927 and around one-third of Buryat population in Russia died in the 1900s–1950s.Войны ХХ века и их жертвы /тысяч человек/ (Russian)Буриад-Монголын үндэстний хөдөлгөөн, тулгамдсан асуудлууд (Mongolian) In 1919 the Buryats established a small theocratic Balagad state in Kizhinginsky District of Russia and the Buryat's state fell in 1926. In 1958, the name \\"Mongol\\" was removed from the name of the Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. On 22 January 1922 Mongolia proposed to migrate the Kalmyks during the Kalmykian Famine but Russia refused. 71–72,000 (93,000?; around half of the population) Kalmyks died during the famine.XX зууны 20, 30-аад онд халимагуудын 98 хувь аймшигт өлсгөлөнд автсан (Mongolian) The Kalmyks revolted against Russia in 1926, 1930 and 1942–1943. In 1913, Nicholas II, Tsar of Russia, said : \\"We need to prevent from Volga Tatars. But the Kalmyks are more dangerous than them because they are the Mongols so send them to war to reduce the population\\". Халимагийн эмгэнэлт түүхээс (Mongolian) On 23 April 1923 Joseph Stalin, communist leader of Russia, said: \\"We are carrying out wrong policy on the Kalmyks who related to the Mongols.Our policy is too peaceful\\". In March 1927, Soviet deported 20,000 Kalmyks to Siberia, tundra and Karelia.The Kalmyks founded sovereign Republic of Oirat-Kalmyk on 22 March 1930. The Oirat's state had a small army and 200 Kalmyk soldiers defeated 1,700 Soviet soldiers in Durvud province of Kalmykia but the Oirat's state destroyed by the Soviet Army in 1930. Kalmykian nationalists and Pan- Mongolists attempted to migrate Kalmyks to Mongolia in the 1920s.Mongolia suggested to migrate the Soviet Union's Mongols to Mongolia in the 1920s but Russia refused the suggestion. Russia deported all Kalmyks to Siberia in 1943 and around half of (97–98,000) Kalmyk people deported to Siberia died before being allowed to return home in 1957. The government of the Soviet Union forbade teaching Kalmyk language during the deportation. The Kalmyks' main purpose was to migrate to Mongolia and many Kalmyks joined the German Army. Marshal Khorloogiin Choibalsan attempted to migrate the deportees to Mongolia and he met with them in Siberia during his visit to Russia. Under the Law of the Russian Federation of April 26, 1991 \\"On Rehabilitation of Exiled Peoples\\" repressions against Kalmyks and other peoples were qualified as an act of genocide. China Imperial China Qing genocide of Dzungars The Dzungars Mongols who lived in an area that stretched from the west end of the Great Wall of China to present-day eastern Kazakhstan and from present-day northern Kyrgyzstan to southern Siberia (most of which is located in present- day Xinjiang), were the last nomadic empire to threaten China, which they did from the early 17th century through the middle of the 18th century.Chapters 3–7 of describe the rise and fall of the Dzungar Khanate and its relations with other Mongol tribes, the Qing dynasty, and the Russian empire. After a series of inconclusive military conflicts that started in the 1680s, the Dzungars were subjugated by the Manchu-led Qing dynasty (1644–1911) in the late 1750s. Clarke argued that the Qing campaign in 1757–58 \\"amounted to the complete destruction of not only the Dzungar state but of the Dzungars as a people.\\" After the Qianlong Emperor led Qing forces to victory over the Dzungar Oirat (Western) Mongols in 1755, he originally was going to split the Dzungar Khanates into four tribes headed by four Khans, the Khoit tribe was to have the Dzungar leader Amursana as its Khan. Amursana rejected the Qing arrangement and rebelled since he wanted to be leader of a united Dzungar nation. The Qianlong Emperor then issued his orders for the genocide and eradication of the entire Dzungar nation and name, Qing Manchu Bannermen and Khalkha (Eastern) Mongols enslaved Dzungar women and children while slaying the other Dzungars.Millward 2007, p. 95. The Qianlong Emperor then ordered the genocide of the Dzungars, moving the remaining Dzungar people to the mainland and ordering the generals to kill all the men in Barkol or Suzhou, and divided their wives and children to Qing forces, which were made out of Manchu Bannermen and Khalkha Mongols.大清高宗純皇帝實錄, 乾隆二十四年平定準噶爾方略 Qing scholar Wei Yuan estimated the total population of Dzungars before the fall at 600,000 people, or 200,000 households. Oirat officer Saaral betrayed and battled against the Oirats. In a widely citeded. Starr 2004, p. 54. account of the war, Wei Yuan wrote that about 40% of the Dzungar households were killed by smallpox, 20% fled to Russia or Kazakh tribes, and 30% were killed by the Qing army of Manchu Bannermen and Khalkha Mongols, leaving no yurts in an area of several thousands li except those of the surrendered.Wei Yuan, 聖武記 Military history of the Qing dynasty, vol.4. \\"計數十萬戶中，先痘死者十之四，繼竄入俄羅斯哈薩克者十之二，卒殲於大兵者十之三。除婦孺充賞外，至今惟來降受屯之厄鲁特若干戶，編設佐領昂吉，此外數千里間，無瓦剌一氊帳。\\" During this war Kazakhs attacked dispersed Oirats and Altays.

Mark Levene, a historian whose recent research interests focus on genocide, has stated that the extermination of the Dzungars was \\"arguably the eighteenth century genocide par excellence.\\" The Dzungar genocide was completed by a combination of a smallpox epidemic and the direct slaughter of Dzungars by Qing forces made out of Manchu Bannermen and (Khalkha) Mongols.Lorge 2006, p. 165. Anti- Dzungar Uyghur rebels from the Turfan and Hami oases had submitted to Qing rule as vassals and requested Qing help for overthrowing Dzungar rule. Uyghur leaders like Emin Khoja were granted titles within the Qing nobility, and these Uyghurs helped supply the Qing military forces during the anti-Dzungar campaign. The Qing employed Khoja Emin in its campaign against the Dzungars and used him as an intermediary with Muslims from the Tarim Basin to inform them that the Qing were only aiming to kill Dzungars and that they would leave the Muslims alone, and also to convince them to kill the Dzungars themselves and side with the Qing since the Qing noted the Muslims' resentment of their former experience under Dzungar rule at the hands of Tsewang Araptan.Kim 2008, p. 139. It was not until generations later that Dzungaria rebounded from the destruction and near liquidation of the Dzungars after the mass slayings of nearly a million Dzungars.Tyler 2004, p. 55. Historian Peter Perdue has shown that the decimation of the Dzungars was the result of an explicit policy of extermination launched by the Qianlong Emperor,Perdue 2009, p. 285. Perdue attributed the decimation of the Dzungars to a \\"deliberate use of massacre\\" and has described it as an \\"ethnic genocide\\". Although this \\"deliberate use of massacre\\" has been largely ignored by modern scholars, Dr. Mark Levene, a historian whose recent research interests focus on genocide,Dr. Mark Levene , Southampton University, see \\"Areas where I can offer Postgraduate Supervision\\". Retrieved 2009-02-09. has stated that the extermination of the Dzungars was \\"arguably the eighteenth century genocide par excellence.\\" The Qing \\"final solution\\" of genocide to solve the problem of the Dzungars made the Qing sponsored settlement of millions of Han Chinese, Hui, Turkestani Oasis people (Uyghurs) and Manchu Bannermen in Dzungaria possible, since the land was now devoid of Dzungars. The Dzungarian basin, which used to be inhabited by Dzungars is currently inhabited by Kazakhs.Tyler 2004, p. 4. In northern Xinjiang, the Qing brought in Han, Hui, Uyghur, Xibe, and Kazakh colonists after they exterminated the Dzungar Oirat Mongols in the region, with one third of Xinjiang's total population consisting of Hui and Han in the northern are, while around two thirds were Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang's Tarim Basin.ed. Starr 2004, p. 243. In Dzungaria, the Qing established new cities like Ürümqi and Yining.Millward 1998, p. 102. The Qing were the ones who unified Xinjiang and changed its demographic situation.Liu & Faure 1996, p. 71. The depopulation of northern Xinjiang after the Buddhist Oirats were slaughtered, led to the Qing settling Manchu, Sibo (Xibe), Daurs (a sub- Mongolic people), Solons, Han Chinese, Hui Muslims, and Turkic Muslim Taranchis in the north, with Han Chinese and Hui migrants making up the greatest number of settlers. Since it was the crushing of the Buddhist Öölöd (Dzungars) by the Qing which led to promotion of Islam and the empowerment of the Muslim Begs in southern Xinjiang, and migration of Muslim Taranchis to northern Xinjiang, it was proposed by Henry Schwarz that \\"the Qing victory was, in a certain sense, a victory for Islam\\".Liu & Faure 1996, p. 72. Xinjiang was a unified defined geographic identity was created and developed by the Qing. It was the Qing who led to Turkic Muslim power in the region increasing since the Mongol power was crushed by the Qing while Turkic Muslim culture and identity was tolerated or even promoted by the Qing.Liu & Faure 1996, p. 76. The Qianlong Emperor explicitly commemorated the Qing conquest of the Dzungars as having added new territory in Xinjiang to \\"China\\", defining China as a multi ethnic state, rejecting the idea that China only meant Han areas in \\"China proper\\", meaning that according to the Qing, both Han and non- Han peoples were part of \\"China\\", which included Xinjiang which the Qing conquered from the Dzungars.Zhao 2006, pp. 11,12. After the Qing were done conquering Dzungaria in 1759, they proclaimed that the new land which formerly belonged to the Dzungars, was now absorbed into \\"China\\" (Dulimbai Gurun) in a Manchu language memorial.Dunnell 2004, p. 77.Dunnell 2004, p. 83.Elliott 2001, p. 503. The Qing expounded on their ideology that they were bringing together the \\"outer\\" non-Han Chinese like the Inner Mongols, Eastern Mongols, Oirat Mongols, and Tibetans together with the \\"inner\\" Han Chinese, into \\"one family\\" united in the Qing state, showing that the diverse subjects of the Qing were all part of one family, the Qing used the phrase \\"Zhong Wai Yi Jia\\" 中外一家 or \\"Nei Wai Yi Jia\\" 內外一家 (\\"interior and exterior as one family\\"), to convey this idea of \\"unification\\" of the different peoples.Dunnell 2004, pp. 76-77. In the Manchu official Tulisen's Manchu language account of his meeting with the Torghut leader Ayuka Khan, it was mentioned that while the Torghuts were unlike the Russians, the \\"people of the Central Kingdom\\" (dulimba-i gurun 中國, Zhongguo) were like the Torghut Mongols, and the \\"people of the Central Kingdom\\" referred to the Manchus.Perdue 2009, p. 218. The Inner Mongolian Chahar leader Ligdan Khan, a descendant of Genghis Khan, opposed and fought against the Qing until he died of smallpox in 1634. Thereafter, the Inner Mongols under his son Ejei Khan surrendered to the Qing and was given the title of Prince (Qin Wang, 親王), and Inner Mongolian nobility became closely tied to the Qing royal family and intermarried with them extensively. Ejei Khan died in 1661 and was succeeded by his brother Abunai. After Abunai showed disaffection with Manchu Qing rule, he was placed under house arrested in 1669 in Shenyang and the Kangxi Emperor gave his title to his son Borni. Abunai then bid his time and then he and his brother Lubuzung revolted against the Qing in 1675 during the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, with 3,000 Chahar Mongol followers joining in on the revolt. The revolt was put down within two months, the Qing then crushed the rebels in a battle on April 20, 1675, killing Abunai and all his followers. Their title was abolished, all Chahar Mongol royal males were executed even if they were born to Manchu Qing princesses, and all Chahar Mongol royal females were sold into slavery except the Manchu Qing princesses. The Chahar Mongols were then put under the direct control of the Qing Emperor unlike the other Inner Mongol leagues which maintained their autonomy. Jindandao massacre of Mongols Ordinary Mongols were not allowed to travel outside their own leagues. During the eighteenth century, growing numbers of Han Chinese settlers had illegally begun to move into the Inner Mongolian steppe. By 1791 there had been so many Han Chinese settlers in the Front Gorlos Banner that the jasak had petitioned the Qing government to legalize the status of the peasants who had already settled there. The first half of the 19th century saw the heyday of the Qing order. Both Inner and Outer Mongolia continued to supply the Qing armies with cavalry, although the government had tried to keep the Outer Mongols apart from the empire's wars in that century. Since the dynasty placed the Mongols well under its control, the government no longer feared of them. At the same time, as the ruling Manchus had become increasingly sinicized and population pressure in China proper emerged, the dynasty began to abandon its earlier attempts to block Han Chinese trade penetration and settlement in the steppe. After all, Han Chinese economic penetration served the dynasty's interests, because it not only provided support of the government's Mongolian administrative apparatus, but also bound the Mongols more tightly to the rest of empire. The Qing administrators, increasing in league with Han Chinese trading firms, solidly supported Chinese commerce. There was little that ordinary Mongols, who remained in the banners and continued their lives as herdsmen, could do to protect themselves against the growing exactions that banner princes, monasteries, and Han creditors imposed upon them, and ordinary herdsmen had little resource against exorbitant taxation and levies. In the 19th century, agriculture had been spread in the steppe and pastureland was increasingly converted to agricultural use. Even during the 18th century growing number of Han settlers had already illegally begun to move into the Inner Mongolian steppe and to lease land from monasteries and banner princes, slowing diminishing the grazing areas for the Mongols' livestock. While alienation of pasture in this way was largely illegal, the practice continued unchecked. By 1852, Han Chinese merchants had deeply penetrated Inner Mongolia, and the Mongols had run up unpayable debts. The monasteries had taken over substantial grazing lands, and monasteries, merchants and banner princes had leased many pasture lands to Han Chinese as farmland, although there was also popular resentment against oppressive taxation, Han usurpers, shrinkage of pasture, as well as debts and abuse of the banner princes' authority. Northern parts of what are today's Chinese provinces of Shaanxi, Shanxi and Hebei were ethnically cleansed of Mongols, with the erasing of nomadic minorities legacies in these regions so as to dispel the notion of borderlands as traditionally Mongolian inhabited. Increasingly during the nineteenth century, the Manchurians were becoming increasingly sinicized themselves, and faced with the Russian threat, they began to encourage Han Chinese farmers to settle in both Mongolia and Manchuria. This policy was followed by subsequent governments. The railroads that were being built in these regions were especially useful to the Han Chinese settlers. Land was either sold by Mongol Princes, or leased to Han Chinese farmers, or simply taken away from the nomads and given to Han Chinese farmers. Many impoverished Mongols also began to take up farming in the steppe, renting farmlands from their banner princes or from Han merchant landlords who had acquired them for agriculture as settlement for debts. Qing rule with tacit continuous Han illegal settlement over the 18th and 19th centuries, had led to a wave of incidents culminating in Mongol ethnic cleansing and displacement. All these incidents culminated in the Jindandao Incident, where an ethnic Han Chinese secret society called Jindandao () rose up and revolted in Inner Mongolia in November 1891. The Chinese rebels massacred 150,000 Mongols and destroyed many Mongol lama temples before being suppressed by government forces in late December.Paul Hyer, The Chin-tan-tao Movement -- A Chinese Revolt in Mongolia (1891), Altaica, pp. 105--112, 1977. The outbreak of the rebellion took place in November, 1891 when rebels attacked the government office of the Aukhan Banner. They slaughtered the jasagh (head) of the banner, Prince Daghchin, who was concurrently the head of the Juu Uda League, and vandalized his ancestral tomb. They quickly rampaged southward into the Ongniud banners (and Chifeng County within them), and then into the Kharachin Left Banner. Around the same time, another group of rebels captured Chaoyang County within the Tümed Right Banner, the Josutu League. They moved into the neighboring Tümed banner and two Kharachin banners while annihilating Mongol communities. They openly employed anti-Mongol and anti-dynastic slogans including \\"Defeat the Qing and wipe of the Mongols\\" () and \\"Kill Mongols in revenge\\" (). The Jindandao devastated Mongol communities in the southeastern borderland and forced many Mongols to take refuge in northern banners.Borjigin Burensain, The Complex Structure of Ethnic Conflict in the Frontier: Through the Debates around the ‘Jindandao Incident’ in 1891, Inner Asia, Vol. 6, No.1, pp. 41-60, 2004. Anyway, the Qing attitude towards Han Chinese colonization of Mongolian lands grew more and more favourable under pressure of events, particularly after the Amur Annexation by Russia in 1860. This would reach a peak during the early 20th century, under the name of xinzheng or \\"New Administration\\". Several NGO and human rights groups monitor happening in the autonomous region today. Communist China During the Cultural Revolution, Mongol separatist political parties and ethnic Mongols were targeted and killed by the Red Guards throughout inner Mongolia, at least 346,000 ethnic Mongols were arrested of which at least 27,900 of them were officially executed and another 120,000 were crippled. An even larger number of ethnic Mongols were tortured or beaten to death, died of sexual violence, worked to death in labour camps or committed suicide, but were unrecorded. Recent researchers estimate that the Red Guards killed about 100,000 to 3000,000 Mongols during the Cultural Revolution. Traditional Mongolian lands within the PRC extend further then Inner Mongolia, often up to the old Ming border and further south and west in places like Gansu, Xinjiang the Datong area of Shaanxi and Kalgan. There is also remnants of Möngke Khan's grand army in Szechuan and Yunnan, yet little recognition of the Mongolian legacy in these areas. There has been riots over what has been perceived by ethnic Mongols of increasing marginalisation by Han Chinese and cultural appropriation disputes over hotpot and throat singing There has been continuing efforts by the CPC to dispel separatism and notions of Pan-Mongolism between the indigenous Mongols of China, with other Mongol groups.China Launches 'Anti-Terror' Operation in Inner Mongolia  Prejudice elsewhere  Furthermore, the use of the term \\"Mongoloid\\" as a pejorative still pervades many cultures today, with stereotypes of Mongolians as superstitious alcoholics. Perhaps the image of Mongolians being barbaric or underdeveloped has pervaded in part to their nomadic lifestyle which has survived partly into modernity. The term 'Mong' or 'Mongoloid' for someone who has Down Syndrome has until recently been used in the UK. Also common in the UK and other European countries Mongolians are uncouth or rapists, with Genghis Khan often used as synonym or insult for barbarianism. In Afghanistan, the Hazara ethnic minority, descendant of the Mongol hordes have often faced racial abuse and prejudice for being of Mongolian descent, as explored in the novel, The Kite Runner. Mongolic peoples have also received prejudice over the ages for their practice of traditional customs and Shamanism as backwards or paganistic, along with their historical willingness to embrace multiple faiths at the same time.China Launches 'Strike Hard' Anti-Rumor Campaign in Inner Mongolia  Derogatory terms   In Korean  * Orangkae () – literally \\"Barbarian\\", derogatory term used against Han Chinese, Mongolian and Manchus.

Playing career  Holmes played in 1996 in British Columbia in the Vancouver Metro Soccer League with West Van F.C. The following year he signed with Toronto Lynx in the USL A-League. His signing was announced in a press conference revealing the inaugural 1997 team roster. He made his debut for the club on 12 April 1997 in a match against Jacksonville Cyclones. Holmes assisted the club in qualifying for the post season for the first time in the franchise's history, by finishing 4th in the Northeastern division. The Lynx were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs against the Montreal Impact. He returned the following year, but failed to make the postseason by finishing second last in their division. When the A-League season came to a conclusion he signed with the Toronto Olympians of the Canadian Professional Soccer League for the 1998 season. Though he joined the Olympians late in the season he contributed in the club's undefeated season which allowed them to claim the regular season championship; the first club to reach that milestone in the league's history. In the postseason he appeared in all the club's matches and contributed by scoring a goal in the semi-final match against the North York Astros in a 5-1 victory. The club reached the finals and faced St. Catharines Wolves, but were defeated in a penalty shootout denying the Scarborough-based club in accomplishing a Treble in their debut season. In 1999, the Olympians went undefeated for the second consecutive year in a row. Within that year Holmes managed to win a Treble with the club by claiming the Canada Cup, CPSL Championship, and the League championship. In 2002, the franchise relocated to Mississauga, where he assisted in finishing second in their division.

He was born in Orosh. He was made Kaymakam of Mirdita by the Ottoman Empire during the absence of Prenk Bibë Doda, who was interned in Anatolia due to his participation in the Albanian League of Prizren. With the death of Prenk Bib Doda, who had no male heirs, the Gjonmarkaj lineage passed to Marka Gjoni. Marka Gjoni's initial attempt to claim the title Kapedan was fraught with difficulties because many of the leaders of Mirdita refused to recognise him, but in time he earned their respect. In 1889, alongside Mons. Doci of Orosh, and at the request of some Catholics in Shkodra, Kapedan Marka Gjoni convinced the Monsignor to conduct the first mass at the church of Our Lady of Shkodra in Bachallek, which had remained closed since Shkodra fell in the hands of the Turks in 1479. Thus on April 26, 1889, exactly 410 years later, Mons. Doci administered the first Holy Mass. It was a very important and historical event and to this day a Mass is held on April 26 at the church in honor of Our Lady of Shkodra. In 1896, Marka Gjoni's younger brother Ded Gjoni was killed by Turkish soldiers on his way to Orosh. This event began a downward spiral for the house. The following year, Marka Gjoni was summoned to Shkodra by the Governor under false pretenses. There he was caught and put on a ferry to Istanbul. From there, he was exiled for five years in Mosul, Iraq. After the five years, with help of some nuns, Marka Gjoni was able to escape his exile dressed as a pilgrim, wearing a beard and pulling a donkey, which was bought for that purpose. He infiltrated a caravan of Bedouins and set off to Mecca, pretending to be a pilgrim. A few weeks later, he headed to the Russian border, where he convinced the guards that he was not a Bedouin but a Catholic Albanian who had escaped from exile in Mosul. From there, he went to Odessa and boarded a Russian ferry to the port of Bulgaria. He ultimately made his way back to Orosh where he was welcomed with open arms by the tribes, glad that their Kapedan had returned. In 1921, with financial support from Belgrade, Marka Gjoni rebelled against the Albanian government and proclaimed Mirdita as independent. The so-called Republic of Mirdita was supported by Serbia and Greece, but was swiftly put down by the Albanian government on 20 November 1921. Marka Gjoni was forced to flee to Yugoslavia, thought he later returned to Albania and was active in Mirdita until his death. He and his wife Dava had four daughters and one son, Gjon Markagjoni, a well-known opponent of Communist forces during World War II.

It was formed in December 2014. The Netherlands public prosecutor has declared it to be a terrorist organisation in 2018, despite the Dutch government having earlier provided it with support. Ideology The Levant Front's membership includes the major Sunni Islamist groups operating in northern Syria, representing a spectrum of ideologies from hardline Salafism to apolitical factions linked to the Free Syrian Army. The group imposes Sharia law where murder and apostasy in Islam are punishable by death. In Aleppo, media activists accusing the Levant Front of corruption and otherwise criticizing the group have received threats and faced reprisal attacks. History Initial formation Following months of negotiations in Turkey and northern Syria between the Islamic Front (mainly the al-Tawhid Brigade), the Army of Mujahideen, the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement, the Fastaqim Union, Liwa Ahrar Souriya and the Authenticity and Development Front, on 25 December 2014, the factions announced that they combined their forces into a joint command called the Levant Front.Arab Newspaper article from Dec 25, 2014 including a picture of the leaders of the Levant Front: الجبهة الشامية تجمع ثوار حلب مع بداية 2015 , sirajpress.com The US-backed Hazzm Movement joined the coalition on 30 January 2015, and announced its dissolution and merger with into other Levant Front factions on 1 March 2015. On 20 February 2015, the Levant Front successfully forced Syrian Army forces to retreat from rural towns in Aleppo; during the clashes group claimed to have killed 300 Syrian soldiers and captured 110. During the same month, the group signed an agreement with the YPG and installed Sharia courts in Sheikh Maqsood and Afrin. Dissolution and reestablishment in 2015 On 18 April 2015, the Levant Front announced its dissolution as an alliance, however it stated that the member factions would continue to coordinate with each other militarily. Reasons behind the split were believed to include a lack of coordination between the groups and increasing defections of its members to other factions. Following its end as a single unified group, it continued to act as a joint operations room. On 26 April 2015, along with other major Aleppo based groups, the Levant Front established the Fatah Halab joint operations room. Between May and June 2015, the Trotskyist Leon Sedov Brigade joined the Levant Front. In June 2016, it largely separated from the group, before completely leaving in October 2016. The group announced its reactivation on 18 June. Its new leader is Abu Amr, who was an Ahrar ash-Sham commander. On 29 June, the Levant Front released their charter. Since its reactivation on 18 June, the Levant Front operates as a unified group with former members acting as independent groups. Various groups have joined and left the group since its reactivation, such as Abu Amara Battalions and the Thuwar al-Sham Battalions. SDF offensive against the Levant Front On 16 November 2015, the Syrian Democratic Forces announced the formation of its branch in the Aleppo and Idlib governorates. The YPG, YPJ, and the Army of Revolutionaries were the founding members of the coalition. Subsequently, clashes erupted between the SDF and the Levant Front, comprising Ahrar al- Sham, the al-Nusra Front, and the Mare' Operations Room. On 10 February 2016, the SDF successfully drove out the Levant Front from the Menagh Military Airbase. After days of fierce clashes, the YPG and the Army of Revolutionaries captured a series of villages before reaching and capturing the airbase and the town of Menagh from the Levant Front. According to sources quoted by Reuters, the SDF were supported by Russian airstrikes. The SDF initiated this offensive following the recent Syrian Army offensive on rebel forces in Aleppo supported by Russian airstrikes. The SDF advanced from the Afrin Canton, the westernmost part of Rojava, which had been attacked multiple times by Islamist groups such as the al-Nusra Front. The aim was to prevent attacks on Afrin canton and close the Turkish border to these various Islamist groups. Turkish intervention and rebel infighting On 24 August 2016, Turkey launched a large-scale military campaign in the northern Aleppo Governorate against both ISIL and the SDF. The Levant Front's northern branch was one of the Syrian National Army factions (SNA) that participated in the operation, which captured Jarabulus, al-Bab, and dozens of other towns in northern Aleppo. On 24 January 2017, the al-Nusra Front backed by Nour al-Din al-Zenki attacked the Army of Mujahideen and the Levant Front west of Aleppo, defeating both. The former two groups then merged with several other Islamist factions and declared the formation of Tahrir al-Sham. The Levant Front's western Aleppo branch and several other former Levant Front groups, such as the Army of Mujahideen and the Fastaqim Union, joined Ahrar al-Sham. In July 2017, the Levant Front's northern branch attacked its former ally and co-SNA group, the Descendants of Saladin Brigade, kidnapping its leader and raiding its bases with other SNA units. This followed the Descendants of Saladin Brigade's declaration that it would not take part in a planned Turkish-led offensive against Afrin Canton, which is ruled by the secular, Kurdish-dominated PYD. The Levant Front reportedly justified this operation by claiming that the Descendants of Saladin Brigade's leader Mahmoud Khallo was an al-Qaeda member and allied to the PYD; according to Khallo, the Levant Front tortured him until he was handed over to the Turkish security forces.  Foreign support  The government of the Netherlands provided materials to the Levant Front as part of a program of non-lethal assistance for 22 rebel groups in Syria from 2015 to 2018. In September 2018, the Dutch public prosecution department declared the Levant Front to be a \\"criminal organisation of terrorist intent\\", describing it as a \\"salafist and jihadistic\\" group that \\"strives for the setting up of the caliphate\\". In an interview an official from the group stated that the Levant Front takes ISIL members and their families captive and will sell them to foreign governments and intelligence agencies for revenue, among the nations listed included the United States and United Arab Emirates, rewards for captured ISIL members are over 10 million USD and the transactions are arranged by brokers and Turkish officials.https://www.ft.com/content/c7a7d804-d357-11e6-b06b-680c49b4b4c0 See also * List of armed groups in the Syrian Civil War References Category:Anti-government factions of the Syrian Civil War Category:Free Syrian Army Category:Anti-ISIL factions in Syria Category:Military units and formations established in 2014 Category:Syrian National Army ar:الجبهة الشامية ","title":"Levant Front"},{"id":"44852955","text":"Miami Beach Towers () is a private housing estate located in Tuen Mun, New Territories, Hong Kong.

Where I'm From focuses on two neighbourhood boys who serve as stand-ins for Demers as a child, as well as a variety of local characters. The film explores the changing face of Verdun as well as the filmmaker's anger and unhappiness as a child, due in part to his being adopted. The film also explores the powerful role that the Saint Lawrence River, which borders Verdun, has played in his own imaginative life growing up, as well as the lives of the children in his film. Demers has stated that it also represented a creative risk to make a documentary film not based on interviews, as he had previously done, but rather a personal film that attempts to see life through the eyes of child. Demers, who now lives in Mile End, Montreal, rented an apartment in his old neighbourhood for three months to regain a feel for the neighbourhood as he planned his shoot. During that process, five key themes emerged that became central to the film, according to the director: \\"Childhood. The relationship with nature. Faith. The words. And struggle. That was my guideline.\\" Trilogy The film completed a trilogy of documentary works by Demers—previously a fiction filmmaker— that he was inspired to make after finally meeting his biological mother. She has told him that his biological father was Italian, which inspired a film about traditional Montreal barbers, many of whom were from Italy, entitled Barbiers – Une histoire d'hommes. Demers' follow up film, Les dames en bleu, was about Quebec singer Michel Louvain and his legion of mostly female fans from his mother's generation. Release The film had its world premiere at International Film Festival Rotterdam, followed by the Canadian documentary film festivals RIDM and Hot Docs. It had its theatrical premiere at Excentris in Montreal and Cinema Le Clap in Quebec City on December 26, 2014. The film received a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Cinematography in a Documentary at the 3rd Canadian Screen Awards.

It was built in 1912. It is also known as Hoffman Stack. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 March 2000.  History  The Newmarket Brickworks Chimney was constructed in 1912. At this time, it formed part of the new complex constructed by Aleck Anderson, a former Clerk of Works, known as the Brisbane Brick and Builders Supply Company Ltd - or Brisbane Brick, as it was widely known. Brickmaking has been practised in Queensland since the days of the Moreton Bay penal settlement in the 1820s. Local clay was used for making bricks, firstly in Redcliffe, and then in Brisbane Town. The clayfield in the later case was situated near the stream at the back of the convict settlement. A kiln was first built near the river but a new kiln was built at the field. Brick production was well under way by the beginning of 1826. A boost was given to the use of brick in Queensland, following a disastrous fire in Queen Street in 1864. Changes made to Local Government Ordinances in response to this encouraged the use of brick for building, although the costs involved meant that brick were mainly used for commercial and public buildings. The development of the brick manufacturing industry, given the wide availability of timber in Queensland, has been faced with obstacles. A group of Brisbane builders and architects, led by Aleck Anderson, a former Clerk of Works, and also an experienced builder, formed Brisbane Brick and Builders Supply Company Ltd in 1911 to obtain good quality bricks, which were then not plentifully available in Brisbane. The Company based its design on the Hoffman method of brickmaking. The main kiln was known as the \\"Hoffman Kiln\\". Chimney in 2015 Mechanisation of brickmaking began in the 1870s. By 1896 the successful Hoffman mechanical method of brickmaking was established in Australia, and for the first time, quality mass-produced bricks could be bought at prices well below those of the hand-made equivalent. The Hoffman method was named after Friedrich Hoffman, an Austrian, who invented the technique in 1859. The Hoffman method enabled drying and firing to take place simultaneously. Known as continuous firing, one chamber would be stacked with \\"green\\" bricks, other chambers contained bricks in increasing degrees of dryness, in another chamber firing may just have been commenced, while another may be in full firing, other chambers might be in various degrees of cooling while one chamber might remain empty. Brisbane Brick made its first appearance in the Queensland Post Office Directory (Trades Directory) in 1912-13. As Queensland was essentially a timber state, the building industry developed mainly by the use of timber and the demand for bricks fell below production. Brickyards, quickly piled high with large stocks of unsold bricks, were often forced during those early years to close down for from six months to two years. After one of these closures the Brisbane Brick issued new preference shares to obtain capital to refit and modernise its original plant at Newmarket, and resume manufacturing. From then until the outbreak of World War Two, the company stopped production for one or two brief periods. During the war, the Defence Department utilised the Newmarket sheds, kilns and yards to store goods such as clothing, boots and other equipment. The company's engineering staff were engaged to maintain Liberty ships and other defence work. World War Two set the brick manufacturing industry back many years, and forced the closure of the company's works at Newmarket. With the end of the war, the brick manufacturing industry then faced the introduction of price controls. At this time, the modernisation of many plants was slowed considerably. With the lifting of price controls many companies, Brisbane Brick included, began a concerted drive to make up for what was considered \\"lost time\\". Plants were improved and production methods were streamlined. Demand for bricks for homes and new commercial buildings soon outstripped production and the new industry faced a new, though welcome obstacle, keeping up with growing demand. Brisbane Brick opened Strathpine Bricks Pty Ltd in 1961, at this time the development of new processes, such as the new tunnel kiln equipment to produce bricks, gradually overhauled the shortage. At the time, Newmarket Bricks Pty Ltd, was a subsidiary of Brisbane Brick and Builders Supply Company. The design of the new Strathpine site was considered \\"as modern as tomorrow - the concept in brickworks design completely removes the traditional image of the old-type works with its towering smoke stack and unattractive factory\\". Operation of the Newmarket brickworks were continued by PGH. By 1985, the Newmarket site had frontages to Alderley, Wakefield and Yarradale Streets and Mina Parade. In 1987 the brickworks were demolished and the site subdivided. Buildings demolished included the Hoffman kiln, drying kiln, sorting sheds, dome kiln buildings and an extruder presses building. Over the last decade, the site has been fully redeveloped for industrial purposes. At the time of demolition, the chimney was excluded from the demolition permit on the basis of its rarity as a remaining example in Brisbane of a load-bearing brick chimney stack.  Description  View of Newmarket with the brickworks chimney on the left, circa 1925 The brick chimney is located along Mina Parade, approximately from the road. Access to the site is via an easement. The chimney rises to a height of approximately , and is, consequently, a prominent landmark. The square base is approximately long. The chimney rises about before tapering uniformly to about square. On each face of the bottom section of the chimney there are a number of arched recesses, which appear to be decorative elements. One of the recesses, on the south side of the chimney, facing Mina Parade, has been enclosed with concrete. Several bands of brick as the top of the chimney flue provide further decorative elements to the structure. A metallic band running the length of the chimney on its eastern side, appears to be related to deflecting lightning strikes. Similarly, on the upper section of the chimney, a number of metallic bands are attached around the structure. The chimney is in reasonably good condition, though there is some evidence of rising damp on the eastern side and a crack running the width of the structure, about from the base, on the northern side. Mortar is breaking up and falling away in various sections on all four sides. The whole of the area formerly occupied by the brickworks has been redeveloped and the chimney now stands in its own space.  Heritage listing  Newmarket Brickworks Chimney was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 March 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Newmarket Brickworks Chimney is significant as a rare, surviving example of the brick manufacturing industry in Brisbane, and Queensland, in the early part of the 20th century. At this time, brick makers often struggled for patronage in a state which, predominantly, utilised timber in building construction. The Newmarket Brickworks Chimney is associated with Brisbane Brick and Builders Supply Company Ltd, or Brisbane Brick as it was widely known. Brisbane Brick, in particular, the Newmarket brickworks, provided bricks for buildings within the University of Queensland, including residential colleges and the MLC building on the corner of George and Adelaide Streets. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.

It is grey in colour, with a small black mask. It has blue wattles (although this colour develops with age: in the young of this bird they are actually coloured a light pink). Because of its wattle, the bird is sometimes locally called the blue-wattled crow, although it is not a corvid. Threats and conservation A kōkako about to be released in the Hunua Ranges near Auckland In the early 1900s the North Island kōkako was common in forests throughout the North Island and its offshore islands. Primary causes of kōkako decline were forest clearance by settlers and the introduction of predators such as rats, stoats and possums. Unlike many of New Zealand's most vulnerable birds, kōkako survive in low numbers in several North Island native forests. However, research has shown that female kōkako are particularly at risk of predation as they carry out all incubation and brooding throughout a prolonged (50-day) nesting period. Years of such predation have resulted in populations that are predominantly male and with consequent low productivity rates.North Island kōkako recovery plan 1999 - 2009 (pdf): http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/science-and- technical/tsrp30.pdf Government-funded pest control programmes, and captive breeding programmes are critical to helping maintain population numbers on the mainland. A \\"research by management\\" approach has demonstrated that the kōkako decline can be reversed and populations maintained in mainland forests by innovative management of their habitat. Current research aims to increase management efficiency to ensure long-term kōkako survival. The use of biodegradable 1080 poison has been particularly beneficial in reversing population decline. For example, between 1991 and 1999 the breeding population of kōkako increased tenfold in Mapara Wildlife Reserve (Waikato) thanks to a series of four aerial 1080 operations.DOC's work with kōkako: http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/birds- a-z/kokako/docs-work/ A population of kōkako has also been re-established at the Otanewainuku Forest in the Bay of Plenty.http://www.kiwitrust.org/news.html New populations are also being established through releases on predator-free offshore islands. As a result, conservationists are hopeful of the species' long-term survival.

Unlike its close relative the North Island kōkako it has largely orange wattles, with only a small patch of blue at the base, and was also known as the orange-wattled crow (though it was not a corvid). The last accepted sighting in 2007 was the first considered genuine since 1967, although there have been several other unauthenticated reports.  Taxonomy  The kōkako was first described by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788 as Glaucopis cinerea, from the Latin cinereus (\\"grey\\"). For some time the North Island and South Island birds were considered subspecies of Callaeas cinerea, but since 2001 North Island birds have been officially recognised as C. wilsoni, and genetic evidence confirms their difference. Although the genus Callaeas is masculine, the species epithet cinerea is not masculinised to match, though some authors have argued it should be.  Description  Auckland Museum collection Like the North Island kōkako, this was a slate-grey bird with long legs and a small black mask; Reischek considered its plumage slightly lighter than the North Island species. Its wattles were distinctly orange in colour with a dark blue base; young birds had much lighter wattles. It seems to have spent more time on the ground than the North Island species, but been a better flier. Kōkako have distinctive organ- and flute-like duetting calls. Early explorer Charlie Douglas described the South Island kōkako call: \\"Their notes are very few, but the sweetest and most mellow toned I ever heard a bird produce.\\"  Distribution  At the time of European settlement, South Island kōkako were found on the West Coast from northwest Nelson to Fiordland, as well as Stewart Island, Banks Peninsula, and the Catlins. Subfossil bones suggest they were formerly found throughout the South Island, but forest burning by Polynesians eliminated them from dry eastern lowland forest. Introduced mammalian predators and forest clearance by settlers reduced their numbers further: by 1900 the bird was uncommon in the South Island and Stewart Island, and had almost disappeared by 1960. Its vulnerability compared to the North Island species was perhaps due to its foraging and nesting close to the ground. Conservation status The South Island kōkako was formally declared extinct by the Department of Conservation in 2007, as it had been 40 years since the last authenticated sighting at Mt Aspiring in 1967. In November 2013, however, the Ornithological Society of New Zealand accepted as genuine a reported sighting by two people near Reefton in 2007, and changed the bird's New Zealand Threat Classification status from \\"extinct\\" to \\"data deficient\\". Eleven other sightings from 1990 to 2008 were considered to be only \\"possible\\" or \\"probable\\". A supposed kōkako feather was found in 1995, but examination by scientists at the National Museum showed it to be from a blackbird. Unconfirmed sightings of South Island kōkako and reports of calls have continued, but no authenticated recent remains, feathers, droppings, video, or photographs exist. The IUCN Red List status of the species is, as of 2016, Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct). The most recent unconfirmed sighting was in November 2018, in the Heaphy Track in Kahurangi National Park.

It is also known in Māori as the tīeke. It was formerly considered conspecific with the South Island saddleback. The IUCN lists the species as Near Threatened, while it is listed as a \\"recovering\\" species in the New Zealand Threat Classification System. Taxonomy and systematics North Island Saddleback at Orana Wildlife Park. René Lesson first described the species in 1828 from a specimen collected in the Bay of Islands four years earlier, using the binomial name Icterus rufusater. The specific name rufusater refers to the saddleback's plumage - a combination of the Latin words rufus 'reddish-brown', and ater 'black'. Their placement in the genus Icterus has since been revised, and the two saddleback species are now in their own separate genus, Philesturnus. This genus, created by Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1832, comes from a portmanteau of two bird genera - Philemon (friarbirds) and Sturnus (starlings). Historically, there has been some uncertainty over the status of the North Island saddleback as its own species. North Island and South Island saddlebacks were formerly considered to be two subspecies of Philesturnus carunculatus, with the North Island subspecies being designated P. c. rufusater. However, today they are generally considered to be separate species, with the North Island saddlebacks having the binomial Philesturnus rufusater. Description The plumage of North Island saddlebacks is mostly black apart from the saddle, rump, and tail coverts, which are chestnut. North Island saddlebacks are distinguished from South Island saddlebacks by a faint yellow lining on the superior edge of the saddle. The black bill is starling- like, with orange-red wattles hanging from its base. North Island saddlebacks have an average length of 25 cm. Males tend to be heavier (80 g) than females (69 g), and possess longer bills and larger wattles. North Island saddlebacks produce calls described as \\"cheet, te-te-te-te\\" or \\"ti-e-ke-ke-ke-ke\\". The Māori name for the bird, tīeke, is derived from the sound of this call. Distribution and habitat North Island saddlebacks naturally occupy lowland broadleaf and coastal evergreen forests, though as a result of translocations, they are now also found in various other forest environments. Before the arrival of humans, North Island saddlebacks were widespread on mainland North Island. However, a combination of deforestation and introduced mammalian predators decimated these populations, and by the 1890s, the mainland population was eliminated, and the remaining North Island saddlebacks were only found on Hen Island, a small island off the coast of Northland. Translocations Zealandia Translocation efforts by the New Zealand Wildlife Service began in 1964, with birds being transported to Whatapuke Island. Further translocations have resulted in the North Island saddleback occupying various islands offshore (and onshore, at Lake Rotorua): *Hen and Chicken Islands ** Hen Island ** Whatapuke Island ** Lady Alice Island ** Coppermine Island (colonized) * Little Barrier Island * Tiritiri Matangi Island * Cuvier Island * Red Mercury Island * Stanley Island * Moutohora Island (Whale Island) * Mokoia Island, Lake Rotorua * Kapiti Island * Motuihe Island * Rangitoto Island * Motutapu Island North Island saddlebacks were first re-introduced to the mainland in 2002, at the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary (now known as Zealandia) in Wellington. Some saddlebacks have since started breeding outside of the predator-proof sanctuary. Saddlebacks have also been introduced at several other mainland sanctuaries. The total population of North Island saddlebacks (as of 2013) is estimated to be at least 7,000. Behaviour and ecology Breeding North Island saddlebacks are monogamous and usually mate for life. The breeding season can vary from year to year and location to location, though clutches typically start appearing from August to April. Fledgling saddlebacks are often seen until March and April. Saddleback nests are mostly built in tree cavities, and will lay up to four eggs per clutch. Food and feeding Saddleback feeding on nectar from a plant. The diet of North Island saddlebacks mostly consists of insects, berries, invertebrates, and nectar. Their bill allows them to force open dead wood to expose insects such as grubs. In forests, saddlebacks forage at all heights, but tend to spend most of the time on the forest floor browsing in leaf litter. Threats Introduced mammalian predators, particularly brown rats, were the primary cause of the North Island saddleback's extinction from mainland New Zealand. Saddlebacks are particularly suspectable to predation because of their tendency to roost and nest in low-lying areas. Several translocations of North Island saddlebacks were made to Kapiti Island between 1981 and 1990, but the population suffered high mortality due to rat predation (rats were not eradicated until 1998). Today, North Island saddleback populations are usually found on predator-free islands and in sanctuaries protected by pest fences, affording the birds protection from these predators. North Island saddlebacks appear to be capable of co-existing with some predators such as the kiore, possibly because they have had a longer history of cohabitation than with brown and black rats. Current efforts are focused towards exterminating pests surrounding mainland sanctuaries, to allow the saddlebacks to successfully expand outside of the sanctuaries. South Island saddlebacks have been affected by avian malaria and avian pox; this has not yet spread to the North Island saddlebacks, but there are concerns that it may do so in the future.

Both the North Island saddleback and this species were formerly considered conspecific. The Department of Conservation currently has the South Island saddleback listed as At Risk--Declining. Distribution and habitat Ulva Island During the early 19th century, South Island saddlebacks were widely distributed throughout the South and Stewart Islands. However, by the end of the century, the species was in decline and nearing extinction due to introduced predators. By 1905, the saddlebacks were confined to the South Cape Islands, off the coast of Stewart Island. In 1962, ship rats were introduced to Big South Cape Island, causing the extinction of the greater short-tailed bat, Stewart Island snipe and the Stead's bush wren. In early 1964, 36 individuals on Big South Cape Island were translocated by the New Zealand Wildlife Service to pest-free islands. Big Island received 21 individuals, whilst Kaimohu Island received 15. Further translocations and predator removal allowed the population to recover, with the current population estimated to be around 2000. Behaviour and ecology Threats The South Island saddleback is at risk of outbreaks of avian malaria and avian pox - two outbreaks in 2002 and 2007 resulted in high mortality rates among those infected. Saddlebacks are especially vulnerable as they have had limited exposure to avian malaria, due to the disease's relatively short history in New Zealand. Conservation A threatened species recovery plan was established by the Department of Conservation in 1994, with the aims of maintaining wild populations, adopting quarantine procedures, and removing predators from islands potentially suitable for translocating members of the species.

The premiership was won by the Springvale Football Club, after it defeated Werribee by 38 points in the Grand Final on 20 September. It was Springvale's fourth top division premiership, and the third of four premierships it won in the five years from 1995 to 1999. League membership There were two changes to the membership of the VFL for the 1998 season: the Bendigo Diggers were admitted and the Traralgon Maroons departed. The Preston Knights were excluded from the league in October 1997, but were reinstated the following month. Strategically, the Victorian State Football League desired to fully align the VFL with the statewide under-18s competition (the TAC Cup), with twelve clubs in each competition and one VFL clubs aligned with each TAC Cup club, and the changes were in large part driven by these motivations. Bendigo At this time, there were two regional TAC Cup clubs with no VFL affiliate: the Bendigo Pioneers and the Murray Bushrangers. In early 1997, the VSFL granted a licence to the Bendigo Football Club to enter a team from the 1998 season and to be aligned with the Pioneers. The club was newly established, unlike the VFL's other two regional teams – North Ballarat and Traralgon – who had been strong clubs in their local competitions. The club wore blue and gold and took the nickname Diggers. Traralgon As a condition of its entry to the VFL in 1996, Traralgon had always intended to allow the members another vote on whether to stay in the VFL or return to the Latrobe Valley Football League after two seasons. In those first two seasons, Traralgon had achieved little on-field success (a win-loss record of 4–31–1); off-field, its average home crowd of 1,200 was among the best in the league, but its finances were stretched due to extra travel and difficulties attracting the necessary sponsorship. There was division within the Traralgon board, with different news reports indicating the board recommending staying or leaving. Ultimately, when the vote took place at the end of November 1997, the members voted in favour of departing, and the club returned to the LTFL. Less than a day after Traralgon's departure was announced, a new group which included some members of the Traralgon board formed a new Gippsland Power senior football club board and applied to join the VFL as a replacement for Traralgon, but this never eventuated and the VFL has since remained without Gippsland representation. Preston On 21 October 1997, the VSFL announced that it would not grant Preston a VFL licence for the 1998 season. As had been the case with the attempted expulsion of Werribee two years earlier, the decision came from the VSFL's desire to reduce the number of metropolitan teams from nine to eight to align it with the eight TAC Cup clubs from the greater Melbourne and Geelong region. It was intended that the Northern Knights TAC Cup team would be reallocated from Preston to Port Melbourne, and that the Geelong Falcons TAC Cup team would be reallocated from Port Melbourne to Werribee (which at that time had no affiliated TAC Cup team). The VSFL had reportedly debated whether Preston or Coburg would be the eliminated club, with the latter retained largely due to its superior playing facilities. Preston had been struggling through the 1990s, with no on-field success and difficulty retaining players, and it had courted former VFA club Prahran during the year to consider an administrative merger to help its finances. Nevertheless, it fought to regain its licence, and in a meeting on 8 November it obtained agreement from the VSFL to delay its final decision and allow the club time to campaign for reinstatement. Over the subsequent weeks, the club gained the support of the Darebin Council to upgrade its Preston City Oval facilities. Ultimately, it was Traralgon's departure at the end of November that had the most significant part to play in Preston's licence being reinstated. With no Gippsland-based team to serve as Gippsland Power's affiliate, the VSFL was faced with the prospect of having to align the Power with a metropolitan club, which would remove the need to eliminate the ninth metropolitan club. In moves which took place before 1999, Gippsland Power was allocated to Springvale; the Oakleigh Chargers were reallocated from Springvale to Port Melbourne; and the Geelong Falcons were reallocated from Port Melbourne to Werribee. Preston then remained in the league as the Northern Knights' affiliate.

It is based on the principles of Waldorf education. Located on 11 acres of land, the school is adjacent to Wildcat Canyon, a regional park. Founded in Berkeley in 1980, East Bay Waldorf School offers classes from prekindergarten through grade 8, as well as parent-child classes for infants-age 3 years. The curriculum is based upon the principles of Waldorf Education, and accredited by the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America (AWSNA). Campus The East Bay Waldorf School's campus includes two large fields, an edible garden, eucalyptus and pine groves, several playgrounds designed to integrate play with nature, and farm animals. The outdoor space is augmented by Wildcat Canyon, a 2,427-acre regional park with hiking trails that lead directly from the school. Curriculum The East Bay Waldorf School offers a balanced, comprehensive curriculum based on the principles of Waldorf Education, conceived by the Austrian educator, scientist and philosopher Rudolf Steiner during the 1920s. The Waldorf movement, represented by over 1000 schools worldwide, pioneered the education of the “whole child” introducing the “head, heart and hands” approach to learning. Waldorf teachers integrate art, music and movement into every academic subject, which helps students better engage and absorb the academic material. Each year of the curriculum is designed to be developmentally-specific to the growing child. During the kindergarten years, the focus is on creative play, being outdoors in nature, artistic work, storytelling, and meaningful practical work such as baking bread, sweeping, or woodworking. The teachers develop children's capacity for later academic learning by supporting this free, creative play, encouraging children's imaginative capacities, modeling behavior and creating a predictable environment of reverence and beauty. In the elementary school grades, the day begins with a two-hour class known as “main lesson.” Devoted to a theme in language arts, math, science, or social studies, main lesson blocks last for 3–4 weeks. The latter part of the day is spent in “practical arts” such as handwork, music, Spanish or German language classes, physical education, Eurythmy (a form of movement), as well as language arts and mathematics. Daily chores and significant outdoor time are also essential to the Waldorf approach. Assessment is formative (careful observation with an ongoing qualitative focus on what needs to be developed), rather than summative (typically grades and testing), and teachers stay with the same class for several years, up to an eight-year period. Waldorf education emphasizes moral qualities such as beauty, truth, and inherent goodness. Teachers strive to surround the children with these elements through aesthetically-pleasing classrooms, meaningful activity, and the content of the curriculum. For example, history is taught through legends and biographies that illuminate human strength and heroism in the face of adversity. The use of television, computers and hand-held devices is discouraged for elementary school students at the East Bay Waldorf School. Electronic media is viewed as detrimental to the healthy development of children, and to the cultivation of creativity, perseverance and problem-solving. The East Bay Waldorf School considers education to be much more than acquiring information and skills; therefore learning is a human-to-human endeavor that electronic devices do not support. Events The East Bay Waldorf School recognizes the cycles of the year by celebrating a variety of seasonal festivals and events, including Michaelmas, Harvest Faire, Wanderer's Way, the Spiral of Light, and the May Faire. Several of these events are open to the public.

This was the third class of fish oil-based drug, after omega-3 acid ethyl esters (Lovaza and Omtryg) and ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (Vascepa), to be approved for use as a drug. The first approval by US Food and Drug Administration was granted in 2014. These fish oil drugs are similar to fish oil dietary supplements but the ingredients are better controlled and have been tested in clinical trials. Following phase III clinical trial in mixed dyslipidaemia, AstraZeneca announced on 13 January 2019 that the clinical is terminated as there is no medical benefit of the medication.  Medical uses  Omega-3 carboxylic acids are used in addition to changes in diet to reduce triglyceride levels in adults with severe (≥ 500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia.Epanova label Revised: May, 2014. Updates can be found at FDA label page here Intake of large doses (2.0 to 4.0 g/day) of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids as prescription drugs or dietary supplements are generally required to achieve significant (> 15%) lowering of triglycerides, and at those doses the effects can be significant (from 20% to 35% and even up to 45% in individuals with levels greater that 500 mg/dL). It appears that both eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) lower triglycerides, but DHA appears to raise LDL-C (\\"bad cholesterol\\") more than EPA, while DHA raises HDL-C (\\"good cholesterol\\") while EPA does not. Other fish-oil based drugs There are other omega-3 fish oil based drugs on the market that have similar uses and mechanisms of action. * Omega-3 acid ethyl esters (brand names Omarcor or Lovaza,University of Utah Pharmacy Services (August 15, 2007) \\"Omega-3-acid Ethyl Esters Brand Name Changed from Omacor to Lovaza\\" Omtryg,Omtryg Label Revised April 2014 and as of March 2016, four generic versions.FDA Omega-3 acid ethyl esters products Page accessed March 31, 2016 * Ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (Vascepa)CenterWatch Vascepa (icosapent ethyl) Page accessed March 31, 2016 Dietary supplements There are many fish oil dietary supplements on the market. There appears to be little difference between in effect between dietary supplement and prescription forms of omega-3 fatty acids but EPA and DHA ethyl esters (prescription forms) work less well when taken on an empty stomach or with a low-fat meal. The ingredients of dietary supplements are not as carefully controlled as prescription products and have not been fixed and tested in clinical trials, as prescription drugs have,Sweeney MET. Hypertriglyceridemia Pharmacologic Therapy for Medscape Drugs & Diseases, Ed. Khardori R. Updated: Apr 14, 2015, page accessed April 1, 2016 and the prescription forms are more concentrated, requiring fewer capsules to be taken and increasing the likelihood of compliance.  Side effects  Special caution should be taken with people who have with fish and shellfish allergies. In addition, as with other omega-3 fatty acids, taking omega-3 carboxylic acids puts people who are on anticoagulants at risk for prolonged bleeding time. Side effects include diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, and burping. Omega-3 carboxylic acids have not been tested in pregnant women and are rated pregnancy category C; it is excreted in breast milk and the effects on infants are not known. Pharmacology Omega-3 carboxylic acids are directly absorbed in the small intestine; maximum plasma concentrations are achieved between 5–8 hours after dosing for total EPA and between 5–9 hours after dosing for total DHA. Both DHA and EPA are mainly metabolized in the liver like other fatty acids derived from food. The half-life of EPA from Omega-3 carboxylic acids is about 37 hours, and for DHA about 46 hours. Mechanism of action Omega-3 carboxylic acids, like other omega-3 fatty acid based drugs, appears to reduce production of triglycerides in the liver, and to enhance clearance of triglycerides from circulating very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles; the way it does that is not clear, but potential mechanisms include increased breakdown of fatty acids; inhibition of diglyceride acyltransferase which is involved in biosynthesis of triglycerides in the liver; and increased activity of lipoprotein lipase in blood. Physical and chemical properties Omega-3 carboxylic acids are derived from fish oil and are a purified mixture of the polyunsaturated free fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The drug contains a concentration of DHA at 15-25 % and a concentration of EPA at 50-60%. History Omega-3 carboxylic acids was approved by the US FDA in May 2014 and was the third prescription form of an omega-3 product approved in the United States but the first in free fatty acid form. Development was completed and regulatory was obtained by AstraZeneca, but omega-3 carboxylic acids were first created at Chrysalis Pharma in Switzerland; Princeton-based Omthera had obtained rights from Chysalis, and Astrazeneca acquired Omthera in 2013 for $323 million in cash along with up to $120 million in milestones.John Carroll for FierceBiotech.May 6, 2014. AstraZeneca wins FDA OK for another fish-oil heart pill, enters crowded market At the time Epanova was approved, AstraZeneca's plan was to develop a combination product with rosuvastatin, the patent on which was set to expire in 2016. Clinical trials of Epanova for severe hypertriglyceridemia showed good results. However, a clinical trial on mixed dyslipidaemia (hypertriglyceridemia with hypocholesterolemia) was started on 30 October 2014, which after phase III, was terminated on 13 January 2019 due to lack of medical benefit in the results.

Even after Muslim rule, the three valli system was still continued up until 1818, when Sicily was divided into seven provinces.

It played a key role in literary history, publishing many important authors, for example John Buchan, George Tomkyns Chesney, Joseph Conrad, George Eliot, E. M. Forster, John Galt, John Neal, Thomas De Quincey, Charles Reade, Margaret Oliphant, John Hanning Speke and Anthony Trollope, both in books and in the monthly Blackwood’s Magazine. History In 1804 William Blackwood opened a shop in South Bridge Street, Edinburgh, for the sale of old, rare and curious books. He undertook the Scottish agency for John Murray and other London publishers, and gradually drifted into publishing on his own account, moving in 1816 to Princes Street. On 1 April 1817 the first number of the Edinburgh Monthly Magazine was published, which on its seventh number became Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. \\"Maga,\\" as this magazine soon came to be called, was the organ of the Scottish Tory party, and round it gathered a host of able writers. In May 1824 Blackwood's became the first British literary journal to publish work by an American with an essay by John Neal that got reprinted across Europe. Over the following year and a half the magazine published Neal's \\"American Writers\\" series, which is the first written history of American literature. The relationship between Blackwood and Neal fell apart over Neal's novel Brother Jonathan, which Blackwood published at a loss in late 1825. In 1829 he wrote to his son William in India telling him that he was moving from Princes Street to 45 George Street as George Street was \\"becoming more and more a place of business and the east end of Princes Street is now like Charring Cross, a mere place for coaches\\". His brother Thomas bought 43 and in 1830 Thomas Hamilton remodelled the entire frontage of the pair for the Blackwood Brothers or Messrs. Blackwood. Thomas' shop operated as a silk merchant. William Blackwood died in 1834 and is buried in an ornate vault in the lower western section of Old Calton Cemetery. He was succeeded by his two sons, Alexander and Robert, who added a London branch to the firm. In 1845 Alexander Blackwood died, and shortly afterwards Robert. A younger brother, John Blackwood succeeded to the business; four years later he was joined by Major William Blackwood, who continued in the firm until his death in 1861. In 1862 the major's elder son, William Blackwood (born 1836), was taken into partnership. On the death of John Blackwood, William Blackwood junior was left in sole control of the business. With him were associated his nephews, George William and JH Blackwood, sons of Major George Blackwood, who was killed at Maiwand in 1880. The last member of the Blackwood family to run the company was Douglas Blackwood. During World War II Blackwood was a fighter pilot and at the height of the Battle of Britain recalled looking down from 25,000 feet to see the firm's London office in Paternoster Row ablaze. Millions of books were lost in the fire and the destruction of Blackwood's base in the City of London marked the beginning of the firm's decline.

It was built between 1920 and 1950. It is also known as Anzac Cottage (no.37). It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 February 2007.  History  This small timber weatherboard house was built as an Anzac Cottage Trust home in 1920, and was occupied by members of the same family until 1998. The Australian public reacted to the many casualties and deaths suffered during World War I by building war memorials and providing homes for wounded veterans and families of those killed. One such project was the Anzac Cottage Trust. Many of the cottages were built on donated land, with volunteers supplying most of the labour, and were built in Australian states. The first was most likely erected in Western Australia by volunteer labour, and officially opened on 15 April 1916. In Queensland the initial Anzac Cottage Trust, a sub-committee of the Queensland War Council established 25 September 1915, met weekly at the Commercial Travelers Sample Rooms in Charlotte Street. The objective of this committee was to acquire land for the erection of homes for homeless widows, or other female dependents, and descendants of deceased men who had enlisted in Queensland for military or naval service during World War I. The committee was also responsible for nominating those who would occupy the cottage. The widow had to be of \\"good character\\", remain single, not be seen drinking publicly nor have male callers. She was also required to pay the bills, any local government charges, for fire insurance, and maintain the house in good order. From the outset, the land was to be vested in the Public Curator upon trust in perpetuity and the widow or female descendant was required to sign a lease with the Public Curator. The rental was intended to fund the maintenance of these cottages. An occupier could apply to this fund for assistance with upkeep costs. The Public Trustee, with agreement from the Committee, had the right to raise revenue for the repairing, maintaining and/or rebuilding of such cottages. The conditions of tenancy for the Anzac Cottages also stated that any child, descendant or widow who married had immediately to vacate the property. They were allowed to reside or share the occupancy only with the approval of the Committee. On the death of the widow, a descendant capable of caring for the remaining family could, at the discretion of the Committee, be allowed to remain on signing of a lease. Alternately, the house could be re- let to a person who fitted the Trust's conditions and on similar terms. The first Anzac cottage built in Queensland was at Wynnum, opened by the Governor on 12 August 1917. Many of the Anzac Cottages constructed in Queensland were funded from profits of \\"Golden Caskets\\", the Queensland lottery, numbers three, four and five. This was an initiative of Harry Coyne, chairman of the Anzac Cottage Committee, subcommittee to the Queensland War Council. The prizes awarded in these lotteries were very large. First, second and third prizes were £5,000, £1,000 and £500 respectively and the total prize pool was £10.000. Golden Casket number three went on sale on 2 March 1918 and was drawn at the Brisbane Stadium on 23 August 1918. The fourth Golden Casket sold out in less than five months and was drawn 14 May 1919, while the fifth was drawn on 13 November 1919. Harry Coyne MP, still Chairman of the Anzac Cottage Committee, was again at the Brisbane Stadium to conduct the draw and told the large crowd that profits from the three Golden Caskets would allow for between 60 and 80 homes to be built for war widows. Thirty-eight cottages were built in Brisbane, and most had a name reflecting the Anzac theme; names such as Kitchener, Haig, Monash, Hopetown and Chauvel. The second last cottage to be built, number 37 was called Strathearn and was erected at 16 Quarry Road, Alderley. It was occupied by the Warner family. English born John Thomas Warner was 42 when he enrolled at Enoggera, although he gave his age as 38 years old. Private Warner was buried in a shell explosion at Ypres in 1917. Rescued the following day he was sent home. He died during March 1920 and was buried in a war grave in Toowong Cemetery. The newly widowed Mrs Mary Ann Warner and five children moved into their new Anzac Cottage, Strathearn in July 1920, and a son Jack was born soon after. Her daughter Mrs Florence Richardson Handley, who was ten when the family moved into Strathearn, moved back into the family home following the death of her husband. As a World War II Prisoner of War he worked on the Burma railway and died when his Japanese transport was torpedoed. Mrs Warner was a keen gardener and a family tradition was the adding of a piece of a sacred bamboo planted by Mrs Warner to wedding bouquets and the giving of each family member a cutting for planting when they moved into a new home. Mrs Warner was working in her garden when she died in 1955, and the Public Curator permitted Mrs Florence Richardson Handley to remain in the house. This Anzac Cottage remained the venue for family activities such as Christmas Day, until Florence Handley died on 10 February 1998. Since then, the house has remained vacant. The wooden fence which was supported by stones from the nearby quarry has been recently removed, as have some of the trees and shrubs. The Anzac Trust Committee was disbanded in 1932 with all responsibility passing to the Public Curator (renamed Public Trustee in 1978). By 1956 the number of World War I widows and dependents requiring housing had decreased and most of the cottages were rented to non-Anzac families. Also, the maintenance fund was in financial straits so that it was suggested by the Public Curator to the Attorney General that some of the vacant dwellings be sold to fund repairs to tenanted cottages and consideration be given to winding up the Trust. The Anzac Cottages & TB Homes Act of 1960 was subsequently passed, enabling the sale of Anzac Cottages. Thirteen were sold by 6 April 1963 and Strathearn was the only remaining Anzac Cottage the Public Trustee was still responsible for in 1999. It was sold in September 2000.  Description  Strathearn, 2015 This house is a single storey, timber weatherboard house with a short ridge corrugated iron roof. It occupies an elevated position with the back windows looking out towards Enoggera Army Barracks and the hills. Garden obscures much of the house, 2015The front elevation of the cottage features a verandah which has been enclosed with fibro sheeting. A centrally-located entry is accessed via two timber steps and features side-hung casement doors. Abutting the casement doors on either side is a louvred opening, extending half-way down the front facade from the front eave. A casement window is located either side of the central entry. The side walls of the enclosed verandah contain louvred openings. The side elevations of the cottage feature two, two-paned sash windows, surmounted by metal shades. A metal shade also covers the rear kitchen window. The cottage is located on a sloping block, resulting in the building being high-set at the back. It is supported on capped concrete posts, infilled with timber slats. A timber staircase provides access to the rear of the house. Positioned above the stairs in the rear wall are three casement windows. Typical of pyramidal and short ridge houses with a front verandah the front door opens onto a passageway that separates the two front bedrooms and leads into the sitting room. The kitchen and dining room are at the back of the house. While the house originally had a third bedroom, this has been converted into a bathroom. Substantial plantings are located to the rear (western) and side (southern) elevations of the cottage.

Only one prototype was built, though it was intended to lead to series production. Design and development The Norélic was a prototype two-seat, single rotor helicopter with an unusual anti-torque system, without a manual cyclic pitch control. Its two crew sat side by side with large, single curvature transparencies in front of them but with open cockpit sides. The Mathis G.7R seven-cylinder radial engine was immediately behind them, with its crankshaft vertical; the Norélic was the first French helicopter with its engine in this orientation. The driveshaft rose through the fuselage to the rotor hub, which was slightly offset forwards on a two side-by-side pillar, faired support. The Norélic had a two-blade articulated rotor with undamped flapping hinges; the blades had the same chord and aerofoil from hub to tip and were each built around a single solid spar with ribs and a thin metal skin, all clamped together. Blade pitch was automatically controlled by small servo or pilot airfoils mounted on rods at right-angles to the rotors. Though reminiscent of the servos on the Hiller 360, those on the Norélic were themselves flappable and were intended to control both cyclic pitch and the flapping amplitude of the main rotors. Thus the cockpit cyclic pitch control was absent, and instead roll was produced by sideways motion of the hub via its parallel support pillars, which separated the centres of lift and gravity. Effects due to variations in the position of the centre of gravity could be trimmed out by longitudinal movements of the hub. The servo blades also served as rotor speed governors; restrained by springs, they could slide outward as the rotor speed began to increase, increasing the pitch and the associated drag to decrease the speed. Collective pitch was thus primarily determined by throttle setting, though there was a collective pitch override lever. Behind the engine the fuselage was conical, tapering to the tail. Instead of a side-mounted anti-torque tail rotor the Nord used a system patented by its designer where an axially driven pusher propeller, rotating within a circular shroud, forced air through four rotatable, vertical airfoils mounted on the shroud trailing edge. The shroud was intended to protect the propeller from the rotor downwash, to guard the propeller from objects on the ground and protect ground staff from the propeller. Air deflected from the blades balanced rotor torque automatically, using information from an hydraulic torque sensor, and also controlled yaw. Two horizontal surfaces controlled fore and aft motion (pitch). In addition the propeller provided thrust for forward propulsion. Its landing gear had mainwheels on cantilever legs and a tailheel mounted on the propeller shroud. The Norélic made its first flight on 17 November 1947. Flight suggests the helicopter continued to be tested through 1949 and that its control system worked well, though it was damaged in two accidents, after which development ended. Thus the intended production machines, with more refined cockpit glazing, faired rotor gear and incorporating lessons learned from the prototype, never appeared. Instead Bruel designed a smaller, lighter, less powerful, single seat machine, the Nord 1710 which shared a similar control system, though horizontal surfaces were added within the shroud for pitch control. This first flew in July 1950 but just a year later was itself abandoned after accidents.

History The Queensland Government established the Queensland War Council on 25 September 1915. Its role was to co-ordinate the funding and initiatives for employment and settlement of returned soldiers, and for assistance to the families of those killed. Specifically, there was a concern that without a co-ordinating body, many well-intentioned but independent initiatives would emerge which would lead to \\"confusion, inefficiencies and overlapping\\". The council's initial membership consisted of the Queensland Premier T. J. Ryan, the Minister for Public Lands John McEwan Hunter, the Minister for Railways John Adamson, the Minister for Public Instruction Herbert Hardacre, the Assistant Minister for Justice John Fihelly, the Commission for Railways Charles Barnard Evans, the Mayor of Brisbane George Down, the Mayor of South Brisbane James Davey, the President of the Chamber of Commence L.M. Bond, the President of the Chamber of Manufacturers M. Becker, and the Director of Labour Walter Russell Crampton. Recruitment was not initially part of the role of the Queensland War Council as a separate Queensland Recruiting Committee had been created in May 1915. However, in October 1915, the Queensland Recruiting Committee become a sub-committee of the Queensland War Council. Local sub-committees of the Queensland War Council were formed in local government areas outside of Brisbane. Their role was to: * recruit more men for reinforcements * provide advice and assistance to the families of those soldiers killed * provide training to disabled soldiers and assistance with artificial limbs and other aids * compile registers of employers in their district and their willingness to employ returned servicemen * provided assistance to returned soldiers who wished to settle as farmers in their district * collection of funds to support such initiatives, although those funds were to be administered by the Queensland War Council Specific areas of responsibility over time included medical care, employment, housing, education and land settlement for returned soldiers or their families. The council was wound up on 1 November 1932.

During the Apollo 8 mission, she became the first female engineer to work in NASA's Mission Control. Later in her career, Northcutt became an attorney specializing in women's rights. In the early 1970s, she served on the national board of directors of the National Organization for Women. Now, she works and volunteers for several organizations in Houston advocating for abortion rights.  Early life  Northcutt was born in Many, Louisiana, on August 10, 1943. She grew up in Luling, Texas, and then moved to Dayton, Texas. Northcutt attended high school at Dayton High School in Liberty County and then went on to study mathematics at the University of Texas.  Career  Engineering for the Apollo Program After graduating in three and a half years, Northcutt was hired in 1965 by TRW, an aerospace contractor with NASA in Houston, as a computress for the new Apollo program. After six months, she had her first performance evaluation, and the head of Houston operations wanted to promote her to technical staff, the term they used for staff doing engineering work. Northcutt was the first woman to work as technical staff. The pay difference between the computress role and the technical staff role was so large that the company did not have mechanisms in place to approve Northcutt's promotion. The operations manager had to schedule pay raises as frequently as possible so that Northcutt's salary was equitable compared to her male colleagues. This experience with the gender pay gap inspired Northcutt's later activism for women's rights. Northcutt was stationed in the Mission Control's Mission Planning and Analysis room. Northcutt and her team designed the return-to- Earth trajectory that the Apollo 8 crew took from the Moon back to Earth. She was able to identify mistakes in the plan, including making calculations that lowered the amount of fuel used to swing around the Moon. Apollo 8 was the second crewed Apollo spacecraft and became the first crewed mission to ever leave Earth orbit. It successfully reached the Moon, orbited it and then returned to Earth safely on December 27, 1968. Northcutt continued working with TRW and NASA for several more years, working NASA missions such as Apollo 13. After learning about the exploded oxygen tank on the Apollo 13 mission, Northcutt and the other engineers who developed the computer program for Apollo 13 all came in to find a way to get the astronauts home safely. The program that she worked on was used to compute the maneuvers used to return the spacecraft. Northcutt and the Mission Operations Team were later awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom Team Award for their work on Apollo 13. In 2019 she gave an interview about her Apollo work. Lay-audience books and articles have claimed that a lunar crater near where the Apollo 17 Lunar Module landed was named for her. However, Gene Cernan, the commander of the Apollo 17 mission, stated in an interview for the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal that in advance of the mission, he had named a crater after the nickname that his daughter used for one of her grandfathers. That nickname was \\"Poppie\\". NASA documents misspelled it as \\"Poppy\\". Apollo crews and the NASA Astronaut Office assigned unofficial names to lunar features for convenience in referring to them. Other names given by Cernan to craters near the landing site were \\"Punk\\", his nickname for his daughter, and \\"Frosty\\" and \\"Rudolph\\", the names of characters in children's Christmastime stories. The International Astronomical Union's / U.S. Geological Survey's Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature has no entries for lunar craters named either \\"Poppie\\" or \\"Poppy\\". Fighting for the women's rights movement While at TRW, Northcutt served on the company's affirmative action committee and advocated to improve its pregnancy leave policies. As one of few women working in engineering, Northcutt became increasingly involved in the women's liberation movement. She helped put on demonstrations, strikes, speeches, press releases and whatever she could to help the cause with the National Organization for Women. She spoke at Houston City Council many times, and in 1974 the mayor of Houston, TX named her the first Women's Advocate for the City. In this position she helped pass a great deal of legislation improving the status of women. She negotiated an agreement with the Houston Police Department enabling women to become police officers. She got the Houston Fire Department to agree to let women serve as firefighters. She led an important equal-pay study going through the entire Houston municipal payroll. She was so dedicated to improving equality that she counted women's versus men's throughout all of Houston, helping to bring even this number into parity. Northcutt helped drastically increase the number of women that were on appointed boards and commissions. She helped pass a law that prohibited hospitals from charging women who came in for rape kits. Later on, Northcutt would become President of both the Houston and entire Texas chapter for the National Organization of Women. During this time, Northcutt was still employed by TRW, receiving a partial salary as she was on loan. When her loan expired, she went back to TRW for a while. However, she believed that \\"If you were doing your job, you should do yourself out of a job\\" and thus went to Merrill Lynch, a stockbroker firm, for a year. Northcutt then switched into the TRW Controls division and during this time attended law school at night. Legal career In 1984, Northcutt graduated summa cum laude from the University of Houston Law Center, becoming a criminal defense lawyer. Northcutt continued to practice law with special emphasis and dedication to her fight for civil rights. Northcutt worked for Jane's Due Process, an organization that ensures protections for pregnant legal minors. She also worked for the Harris County District Attorneys office and was the first prosecutor in the Domestic Violence Unit.

First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte moved into the Tuileries Palace on 19 February 1800 and immediately began to re-establish calm and order after the years of uncertainty and terror of the Revolution. He made peace with the Catholic church; masses were held again in the Cathedral of Notre Dame, priests were allowed to wear ecclesiastical clothing again, and churches to ring their bells.Héron de Villefosse, René, Histoire de Paris, p. 299 To re-establish order in the unruly city, he abolished the elected position of the Mayor of Paris, and replaced it with a Prefect of the Seine and a Prefect of Police, both appointed by him. Each of the twelve arrondissements had its own mayor, but their power was limited to enforcing the decrees of Napoleon's ministers. After he crowned himself Emperor on December 2, 1804, Napoleon began a series of projects to make Paris into an imperial capital to rival ancient Rome. He built monuments to French military glory, including the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, the column in Place Vendôme, and the future church of the Madeleine, intended as a temple to military heroes; and began the Arc de Triomphe. To improve the circulation of traffic in central Paris, he built a wide new street, Rue de Rivoli, from the Place de la Concorde to the Place des Pyramides. He made important improvements to the city's sewers and water supply, including a canal from the Ourcq River, and the construction of a dozen new fountains, including the Fontaine du Palmier on Place du Châtelet; and three new bridges; the Pont d'Iéna, Pont d'Austerlitz, including the Pont des Arts (1804), the first iron bridge in Paris. The Louvre became the Napoleon Museum, in a wing of the former palace, displaying many works of art he brought back from his military campaigns in Italy, Austria, Holland and Spain; and he militarized and re-organized the Grandes écoles, to train engineers and administrators. Between 1801 and 1811, the population of Paris grew from 546,856 to 622,636, nearly the population before the French Revolution, and by 1817 it reached 713,966. During his reign, Paris suffered from war and blockade, but retained its position as a European capital of fashion, art, science, education, and commerce. After his downfall in 1814, the city was occupied by the Prussian, English and German armies. The symbols of the monarchy were restored, but most of Napoleon's monuments and some of his new institutions, including the form of city government, the fire department, and the modernized Grandes écoles, survived. The Parisians Parisians in the Louvre, by Léopold Boilly (1810) According to the census taken by the government, the population of Paris in 1801 was 546,856 persons By 1811, it had grown to 622,636. The wealthiest Parisians lived in the western neighborhoods of the city, along the Champs-Élysées, and the neighborhood around Place Vendome. The poorest Parisians were concentrated in the east, in two neighborhoods; around Mount Sainte-Genevieve in the modern 7th arrondissement, and in the faubourg Saint-Marcel and faubourg Saint- Antoine. The population of the city varied by season; between March and November, 30-40,000 workers to Paris from the French regions; stonemasons and stone cutters who came from the Massif Central and Normandy to work on building construction, weavers and dyers from Belgium and Flanders, and unskilled workers from the Alpine regions, who worked as street sweepers and porters. They would return home during the winter months with what they had earned. The old and new aristocracy Caroline Murat, wife of one of Napoleon's Marechals, a member of the new aristocracy Portrait of Madame Récamier by Jacques-Louis David (1800, Louvre). She lived, along with the wealthiest Parisians of the First Empire, in the faubourgs of Saint-Honoré and Chausėe d'Antin. At the top of the social structure of Paris was the aristocracy, both old and new. In 1788, before the Revolution, the old nobility in Paris had numbered 15-17,000 persons, about three percent of the population. Those who escaped execution during the terror fled abroad to England, Germany, Spain, Russia, and even the United States. Most returned during the reign of Napoleon, and many found positions in the new Imperial court and government. They built new houses, mostly in the area around the Champs-Élysées. They were joined by a new aristocracy created by Napoleon, consisting of his generals, ministers and courtiers, as well as bankers, industrialists, and those who furnished military supplies; about three thousand persons altogether. The new aristocrats often made alliances by marriage with old families, who needed money. One old aristocrat, the Duke of Montmorency, told Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult, who had been made a duke by Napoleon, \\"You are a duke, but you have no ancestors!\\" Soult replied, \\"It's true. We are the ancestors.\\" The wealthiest and most distinguished Parisians during the first Empire purchased town houses between the Palais Royale and the Etoile, especially on the rue du Faubourg Saint Honoré and the Chausée d'Antin: Joseph Bonaparte, the older brother of the Emperor, lived at 31 rue de Faubourg Saint-Honoré, his sister Pauline at number 39, Marshal Louis- Alexandre Berthier at number 35, Marshal Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey in number 63, and Marshal Joachim Murat in number 55, which is now the Élysée Palace, the residence of the Presidents of France. Juliette Récamier lived at number 9 Chausée D'Antin, General Jean Victor Marie Moreau at number 20, and Cardinal Fesch, uncle of Napoleon, at number 68. Other notables of the First Empire settled on the left bank, in the faubourg Saint-Germain. Eugène de Beauharnais, son of the Empress Josephine, lived at 78 rue de Lille, Lucien Bonaparte, younger brother of the Emperor, at 14 rue Saint-Dominique, and Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout at 57 and later 59 on the same street. The wealthy and the middle class Below the old and new aristocracy, there was a large middle class of about 150,000 persons, accounting for about a quarter of the city's population. The lower middle class included small shopkeepers, artisans who had a few employees, government employees, and those in the liberal professions; doctors, lawyers, and accountants. The new upper middle class included Napoleon's generals and high officials, the most successful doctors and lawyers, and a new class of wealthy Parisians who made their money selling supplies to the army, by buying then reselling nationalized property, such as churches; and by speculating in the stock market. It also included a handful of individuals who had begun the first industrial enterprises in Paris: chemical factories, textile mills, and factories making machinery. The newly wealthy, like the aristocracy, tended to live in the west of the city, between Place Vendôme and Etoile, or on the left bank in the Faubourg Saint- Germain. The artisans and workers About 90,000 Parisians, men, women and often children, earned their living as manual workers. According to an 1807 survey by the prefect of police, the largest number worked in the food trades; there were 2250 bakers, 608 pastry chefs, 1269 butchers, 1566 restaurateurs, 16,111 lemonadiers, and 11,832 grocers, and many more in more specialized trades. Twenty-four thousand worked in the building trades, as masons, carpenters, plumbers and other trades. Thirty thousand worked in the clothing trades, including tailors, shoemakers, barbers, and hat-makers; another twelve thousand women worked as seamstresses and cleaning clothing. Twelve thousand worked in furniture workshops; eleven thousand in the metal industry. Fifty percent of the workers were younger than eighteen or older than forty; during the Empire, a large proportion of workers were conscripted into the army. The artisans and workers were concentrated in the eastern neighborhoods. The faubourg Saint-Antoine included the new glass factory of Reuilly and factories making porcelain, pottery, wallpaper, breweries, and many smaller workshops making furniture, locks, and metalwork. The other major industrial neighborhood was the faubourg Saint-Marcel on the left bank, along the banks of the Bievre River, where the tanneries and dyeing workshops were located. Many artisans in these neighborhoods had just two rooms; the front room, with a window, served as the workshop, while the entire family lived in the darker back room. The working-class neighborhoods were densely populated; while the Champs-Élysée neighborhoods had 27,5 persons per hectare, in 1801 there were 1500 persons living in a hectare in the Arcis quarter, which included the Place de Grève, Châtelet and Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie, and a density of 1000 to 1500 persons around Les Halles, rue Saint-Denis and rue Saint-Martin. About sixty to seventy percent of the inhabitants of faubourgs Saint-Antoine and Saint-Marcel were born outside of Paris, mostly in the French provinces. Most came from the north, Picardy, Champagne, the Loire Valley, Berri, and Normandy. Servants Domestic servants, two-thirds of whom were women, made up about fifteen to twenty percent of the population of the capital. Before the Revolution they had worked largely for the nobility, whose families sometimes had as many as thirty servants. During the Empire they were employed more commonly by the new nobility, the newly wealthy and middle class. Upper- middle-class families often had three servants; families of artisans and shopkeepers usually had one. Living conditions of servants depended largely upon the personality of the master, but were never easy. Napoleon abolished the death penalty which previously could be given to a servant who stole from his master, but any servant who was even suspected of stealing would never be able to get another job. Any servant who became pregnant, married or not, could be dismissed immediately. Prostitutes Prostitution in the Palais Royal, by Boilly Prostitution was not legal, but was very common during the Empire. The prostitutes were often women who came from the provinces seeking work, or women who had part-time jobs but could not survive on their small salaries. In 1810, when Paris had a population of about 600,000 persons, the Minister of Police, Savary, estimated that there were 8000 to 9000 women working in maisons closes, or houses of prostitution; 3000 to 4000 who worked out of a rented room; 4000 who worked out of doors, in parks, courtyards, or even cemeteries; and 7000 to 8000 who were prostitutes when money ran short, who were otherwise employed in sewing, selling bouquets of flowers, or other low-paid professions. This accounted in total for five to eight percent of the female population of the city. According to one account from 1814, they had their own social hierarchy; the courtesans at the top, whose clients were exclusively the noble or wealthy; then a class composed of actresses, dancers, and those from the theater world; then semi-respectable prostitutes from the middle class who sometimes received clients at home, often with the husband's consent; then unemployed or working-women who needed money, down to the lowest level, who were found in the city's worst neighborhoods, the Port du Blé, the rue Purgée, and rue Planche Mibray.Deterville, \\"Le Palais-Royal ou les filles en bon fortune, (1815), Paris, Lécrivain. Cited In Fierro, page 67-68. The poor According to Chabrol de Volvic, the Prefect of the Seine from 1812 to 1830, the number of beggars in Paris ranged from more than 110,000 in 1802 to about 100,000 persons in 1812. During the harsh winter of 1803, the Charity Bureaus of the city gave assistance to more than 100,000 persons.Chabrol de Volvic, Recherches statistiques sur la ville de Paris et le departement de la Seine, Paris, Impremerie Royal, 1821-1829, 4 volumes The poorest Parisians lived on the Montagne Saint-Genevieve, and the faubourgs Saint-Antoine and Saint-Marcel, and in the narrow streets of the Île de la Cité, which were particularly crowded. Claude Lachaise, in his Topographie médicale de Paris (1822), described a \\"bizarre assembly of buildings badly constructed, collapsing, damp and dark, each one occupied by twenty-nine or thirty persons, the largest number of whom are masons, iron workers, water-carriers, and street merchants ...the problems are increased by the small size of the rooms, the narrowness of the doors and windows, the multiplicity of families or households, which can reach ten in a single house, and by the influx of poor who are attracted by the low prices of the housing.\\" Children A Parisian family playing checkers (1803) Children and young people were far more numerous in Paris during the Empire than in modern times. In 1800, forty percent of Parisians were under the age of eighteen, compared with 18.7 percent in 1994. Between 1801 and 1820, marriages produced an average of 4.3 children, compared with just .64 children in 1990. In the age before contraception, large numbers of unwanted children were also born, mostly to poor or working women. Five thousand eighty-five children were given to the Hospice des infants trouvées in 1806, about a quarter of the total number of children born in the city. Many newborns were simply clandestinely thrown into the Seine. The mortality rate at the city orphanages was very high; one third died in the first year, another third in the second year. While the children of the middle and upper classes went to school, the children of workers and the poor went to work, often at the age of ten, in a family business or workshop. Marriage, divorce and homosexuality Parisians under Napoleon married relatively old; the average age of marriage between 1789 and 1803 was between thirty and thirty-one for men and twenty-five to twenty-six for women. Unmarried couples living together in concubinage, especially in the working class, were also common. These couples were frequently stable and long- lasting; a third lived together for more than six years, twenty-two percent for more than nine years. Divorce had been common during the Revolution and the Consulate, when one in five marriages ended in divorce. Napoleon was in general hostile to divorces, though he himself divorced Empress Josephine. In 1804 the divorce rate had fallen to ten percent. The number of marriages increased greatly in the last years of the Empire, after the disastrous campaign in Russia, as many young men married to try to avoid military service. The number of marriages rose from 4,561 in 1812 to 6,585 in 1813, the largest number since 1796. Homosexuality was condemned by the Catholic church but, if discreet, was tolerated in Paris. Napoleon did not approve of homosexuality, but during the Consulate, when absent from Paris on military campaigns, he gave interim power to the openly homosexual Jean-Jacques-Régis de Cambacérès. The police paid little attention to it, as long as it was not flagrant. Gay prostitutes were commonly found on the Quai Saint-Nicolas, the place Marché Neuf and the Champs-Élysées. The Prefect of Police reported in 1807 that gay persons were common among restaurateurs, limonadiers, tailors and wig-makers, \\"in ways that were honest and gentle, though they were rarely faithful.\\" Tolerance of homosexuality lasted until 1817, during the restoration of the monarchy, when a campaign of repression began. Money, salaries and the cost of living The metric system was introduced in 1803, as was the franc, worth one hundred centimes, and the sou, worth five centimes. The gold Napoleon coin was worth either 20 or 40 francs, and the government also issued silver coins worth five, two and one franc. The government did not have the resources to collect and remake all the coins of the former regimes, so the gold Louis, with an image of the King, worth 24 pounds, and the écu, a silver count worth three of six pounds, were also legal currency. The coins of all the states within the Empire were also in circulation, including those of the German states, northern and central Italy, the Netherlands, and the Austrian Netherlands (now Belgium). In 1807, a skilled worker, such as a jeweler, perfumer, tailor or furniture maker, could earn 4-6 francs a day; a baker earned 8-12 francs a week; a stonemason earned 2-4 francs a day; an unskilled worker, such as construction laborer, earned 1.50 to 2.5 francs a day. Much of the work was seasonal; most construction work stopped during the winter. Women's salaries were lower; a worker in a tobacco factory earned one franc a day, while women making embroidery or seamstresses earned 50-60 centimes a day, government salaries in 1800 were fixed on a scale of 8000 francs a year for a chief of a division of a Ministry down to 2500 francs a year for a messenger. Fixed prices on goods were rare during the first Empire; almost every product or service was subject to bargaining. However, bread prices were set by the government, and the price of a loaf of four pounds ranged between fifty and ninety centimes during the Empire. A kilogram of beef, depending on quality, cost between 95 and 115 centimes; a liter of ordinary wine from Macon, between 68-71 centimes. A pair of silk stockings for a woman cost 10 francs, a pair of a man's leather shoes cost 11 to 14 francs. The Emperor's famous hats, purchased at the hat maker Poupard, cost sixty francs each. A bath in a bath-house cost 1.25 francs, a haircut for a woman 1.10 francs, a consultation with a doctor cost 3-4 francs. The price of room for two persons on the third floor in the low-income Saint-Jacques neighborhood was 36 francs a year. The average rent of modest-income Parisians was about 69 francs a year; the wealthiest one-eighth of Parisians paid rents of more than 150 francs a year; in 1805 the sculptor Moitte, with a household of seven persons, paid annual rent of 1500 francs for an apartment with a grand salon and bedroom overlooking the Seine, two other bedrooms, dining room, bathroom, kitchen, and cave, in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. The Administration of the City During the French Revolution Paris briefly had a democratically elected mayor and government, the first Paris Commune. This system never really functioned and was suppressed by the French Directory, which eliminated the position of Mayor and divided Paris into twelve separate municipalities, whose leaders were selected by the national government. A new law on 17 February 1800 modified the system; Paris became a single commune, divided into twelve arrondissements, each with its own mayor, once again chosen by Napoleon and the national government. A Council of the Department of the Seine was also created to act as a sort of city council, but its members were also chosen by the national leaders. The real rulers of the city were the Prefect of the Seine, who had his office at the Hôtel de Ville, and the Prefect of Police, whose headquarters was on rue Jerusalem and the quai des Orfèvres on the Île de la Cité. This system, with a brief interruption during the Paris Commune in 1871, remained in effect until 1977. Paris was divided into twelve arrondissements and forty-eight neighborhoods, which corresponded to the Sections created during the French Revolution. The Arrondissements were similar but not identical to the first twelve arrondissements today; they were numbered differently, with the arrondissements on the right bank numbered from one to six from left to right, and the arrondissements on the left bank numbered left to right from seven to twelve. Thus the first arrondissement under Napoleon is largely the 8th arrondissement today, the 6th Napoleonic arrondissement is the modern 1st arrondissement, the Napoleonic 7th is the modern 3rd; and the Napoleonic 12th is the modern 5th. The borders of Paris in 1800 are roughly those of the 12 modern arrondissements; the city limits follow the route of the modern metro line 2 (Nation-Port Dauphine), stopping at Charles-de-Gaulle-Etoile, and those of line 6, from Etoile to Nation. The police and crime Public order in Paris was a top priority of Napoleon. His prefect of police directed forty-eight commissaires of police, one for each neighborhood, and an additional two hundred police inspectors in civilian clothes. None of the police, in fact, had uniforms; a uniformed police force was not established until March 1829. The police were supported by a municipal guard, with 2,154 guardsmen on foot and 180 on horseback. One of the major concerns of the police was the smuggling of goods, especially wine, into the city past the Wall of the Ferme générale, built around the city between 1784 and 1791, where merchants were supposed to pay customs duties. Many smugglers used tunnels under the wall; seventeen tunnels were discovered in 1801 and 1802; one tunnel between Chaillot and Passy was three hundred meters long. Sixty barrels of wine were seized in one tunnel during the same period. Many taverns and guingettes, appeared just outside the walls, particularly in the village of Montmartre, where the untaxed drinks were much cheaper than in the city. The city administration was eventually able to defeat the smugglers by giving higher salaries to the customs agents at the gates, rotating them regularly, and tearing down buildings close to the walls, from which the smugglers operated. Theft was another common concern of the police, increasing or decreasing depending upon economic conditions; there were 1400 recorded thefts in 1809, but 2,727 in 1811. Murders were rare; thirteen in 1801, 17 in 1808, and 28 in 1811. The most sensational crime of the period was the committed by the grocer Trumeau, who poisoned his eldest daughter so he would not have to pay her dowry. Despite some notorious crimes, foreign travelers reported that Paris was one of the safest large cities in Europe; after a visit in 1806-07, the German Karl Berkheim wrote \\"According to those who know Paris, even long before the Revolution, this city has never been as tranquil as it is at this moment. One can walk in complete security, at any hour of the night, in the streets of Paris.\\" Berkheim, Karl Gustav vonLettres sur Paris, ou Correspondance de M*** dans les annees 1806 et 1807, Heidelberg, Mohr et Zimmer, 1809. Citied in Fierro, 2003. P. 45. The Firemen Napoleon and the Empress Marie-Louise escape a deadly fire at the Austrian Embassy (1810). Afterwards, Paris firemen were organized like military units. At the beginning of the Empire, the 293 firemen of Paris were underpaid, untrained and poorly equipped. They usually lived at home and had second jobs, usually as shoemakers. They reported to both the Prefect of the Seine and the Prefect of Police, which caused bureaucratic disputes. They possessed only two ladders, one kept at the National Library, and other at the market of Les Halles. Their shortcomings became evident on 1 July 1810, when a fire broke out at the Austrian Embassy on the Chausée d'Antin during a ball given to celebrate the wedding of Napoleon and Marie-Louise of Austria. Napoleon and Marie-Louise escaped unharmed, but the wife of the Austrian Ambassador and the Princess de la Leyen were killed, and a dozen other guests died later from their burns. Napoleon himself wrote a report of the event, noting that only six firemen had appeared, and several of them were drunk. Napoleon issued a decree on September 18, 1811 which militarized the firemen into a battalion of sapeur-pompiers, with four companies of one hundred forty- two men each, under the Prefect of Police and the Ministry of the Interior. The firemen were required to live in four barracks built for them around the city, and to have watchmen on duty around the city. Health and sickness The health care system of Paris had been severely strained during the Revolution and the Consulate, with little funding or attention given to hospitals. The Revolutionary government, in the name of equality, had abolished the requirement that doctors have licenses, and had allowed anyone to treat patients; in 1801 Napoleon's new Prefect of the Seine reported that, of the seven hundred persons listed as \\"doctors\\" in the official Almanac of Commerce, only three hundred had formal medical training. A new law on 9 March 1803 restored the title of \\"Doctor\\" and the requirement that physicians have medical degrees. Nonetheless, treatment was primitive by modern standards; anesthesia, antiseptics and modern hygienic practices did not yet exist; surgeons operated with their bare hands, wearing their normal street dress with the sleeves rolled up. Doctor giving an inoculation against smallpox, by Louis Léopold Boilly (1807) Napoleon re-organized the hospital system, putting the eleven city hospitals, with five thousand beds altogether, under the administration of the Prefect of the Seine. This was the beginning of the system of municipal public medical assistance for the poor. The other major hospital, Val-de-Grace, was under military administration. The new system recruited the most famous doctors of the time, including Jean-Nicolas Corvisart, Napoleon's personal doctor, and Philippe-Jean Pelletan. The hospitals treated 26,000 patients in 1805 and 43,000 in 1812; the mortality rate of patients ranged between ten and fifteen percent: 4216 died in 1805, and 5634 in 1812. The serious epidemic of influenza struck the city in the winter of 1802–1803; its most prominent sufferers were the Empress Josephine and her daughter, Hortense de Beauharnais, the mother of Napoleon III, who both survived; it killed the poet Jean François de Saint-Lambert, and writers Laharpe and Maréchal. Napoleon created a Health Council under the Prefect of Police to monitor the safety of the water supply, food products, and the environmental effects of new factories and workshops. The committee also made the first systematic surveys of health conditions in Paris neighborhoods, and provided the first widespread vaccinations against smallpox. Napoleon also made efforts to improve the health of the city, by building a canal to provide fresh water and by constructing sewers under the streets that he built, but their effects were limited. An abundant water supply, health standards for housing and efficient sewers did not arrive until Napoleon III and the Second Empire. Cemeteries Prior to Napoleon each parish church in the city had its own small cemetery. For reasons of public health, Louis XIV had decided to close the cemeteries inside the city and move the remains outside the city limits, but only one, the largest, that of the Innocents near Les Halles, had actually been closed. The remaining cemeteries had been neglected since the Revolution and the closure of the churches, and were frequent targets for grave-robbers, who sold the cadavers to medical schools. Frochet, the prefect of Paris, ordered the construction of three large new cemeteries to the north, east and south of the city. The first of these, to the east, had his first burial on 21 May 1804. It became known as Pere Lachaise, for the confessor of Louis XIV, whose country house had been on the site. To the north, the existing cemetery of Montmartre was enlarged, and a new cemetery was planned to the south at Montparnasse, but did not open until 1824. The bones from the old cemeteries within the city limits were exhumed and moved to the abandoned underground stone quarries of the hill of Montsouris. In 1810-11 the new site was given the name the Catacombs and opened to the public. Architecture and the Cityscape The streets In the western neighborhoods of the city, near the Champs Élysées, the streets, mostly built in the 17th and 18th centuries, were reasonably wide and straight. A very few, including the Chausée d'Antin and the rue de l'Odéon, had sidewalks, which had first been introduced into Paris in 1781. The Paris streets in the center and east of the city, with few exceptions, were narrow, twisting, and confined by high rows of houses, sometimes six or seven stories high, which blocked the light. They had no sidewalks, and had a narrow channel down the center with served as a sewer and storm drain. Pedestrians were compelled to compete with traffic in the center of the street. The streets often covered with a thick mud, which clung to shoes and clothing. The mud was mixed with the excrement of the horses who pulled wagons and carriages. A particular Paris profession, the decrotteur, had appeared; men who were expert at scraping mud from shoes. When it rained entrepreneurs put planks over the mud, and charged pedestrians to pass over them. Napoleon made an effort to improve the traffic circulation in the heart of the city by creating new streets; in 1802, on the land of the former convents of the Assumption and the Capucins, he built rue du Mont-Thabor. In 1804 he demolished the Convent of the Feuillants, next to the Louvre, where Louis XVI had briefly been held before being imprisoned in the old Temple, and began construction of a wide new street, the Rue de Rivoli, which was extended from the Place de la Concorde as far as Place des Pyramides. It was constructed between 1811 and 1835, and became the most important east-west axis along the right bank. It was finally finished as far as rue Saint-Antoine by his nephew Napoleon III in 1855. In 1806, on the land of the convent of the Capucins, he built another wide street with sidewalks, named rue Napoleon, between Place Vendôme and the grand boulevards. After his downfall it was renamed Rue de la Paix. In 1811 Napoleon opened the rue de Castiglione, also on site of the old convent of the Feulliants, to connect rue de Rivoli with Place Vendome. The bridges The first Pont d'Austerlitz (1801–07) lined the faubourg Saint-Antoine with the Jardin des Plantes and industries of the left bank The Pont des Arts, the first iron bridge in the city (1802–04) To improve the movement of traffic, goods and people in the city, Napoleon built three new bridges, in addition to the six that already existed, and named two of them after his famous victories. He built the Pont des Arts (1802–04) the first iron bridge in the city, connecting the left bank with the Louvre, a wing of which he had converted into an art gallery, called the Palais des Arts or the Musée Napoleon, which gave the bridge its name. The deck of the bridge was lined with citrus trees in pots, and cost one sou to cross. Further east he built the Pont d'Austerlitz (1801-1807) connecting the Jardin des Plantes and workshops of the left bank with the working-class neighborhoods of Faubourg Saint-Antoine. It was replaced by his nephew, Napoleon III, in 1854. To the west he constructed the Pont d'Iéna, (1808–14) which linked the large parade ground of the École Militaire on the left bank with the hill of Chaillot, where he intended to build a palace for his son, the King of Rome. The new bridge was just finished at the fall of the Empire; the new regime replaced the eagles of Napoleon with the initial of King Louis XVIII. Street numbers Napoleon made one other important contribution to the Paris streets. The numbering of houses had begun in 1729, but each section of the city had its own system, and sometimes the same number would occur several times on the same street, numbers were out of sequence, number 3 might be found near number to 10, and there was no uniformity in where the numbers began. On February 5, 1805, a decree of Duflot, the Prefect of Police, imposed a common system of street numbering to the whole city; numbers were paired, with the even numbers on the right and the odd numbers on the left, and the numbers beginning at the closest point to Seine and increasing as they went away from the river. The new numbers were put up in the summer of 1805, and the system remains in place today. The Passages The narrowness, crowds and mud on the Paris streets led to the creation of a new kind of commercial street, the covered passage, dry and well-lit, where Parisians be sheltered from the weather, stroll, look in the shop windows, and dine in cafes. The first such gallery was opened at the Palais-Royal in 1786, and became immediately popular. It was followed by the Passage Feydau (1790–91), Passage du Caire (1799), Passage des Panoramas (1800), Galerie Saint-Honoré (1807), Passage Delorme (between 188 rue de Rivoli and 177 rue Saint-Honoré, in 1808, and the galerie and passage Montesquieu (now rue Montesquieu) in 1811 and 1812. The Passage des Panoramas took its name from an exhibition organized on the site by the American inventor Robert Fulton. He came to Paris in 1796 to try to interest Napoleon and the French Directory in his inventions, the steamship, submarine and torpedo; while waiting for an answer he built an exhibit space with two rotundas and showed panoramic paintings of Paris, Toulon, Jerusalem, Rome and other cities. Napoleon, who had little interest in the navy, rejected Fulton's inventions, and Fulton went to London instead. In 1800 the covered shopping street opened in the same building, and became a popular success. Monuments Military review in front of the Tuileries in 1810, by Hippolyte Bellangé. Military parades took place around the new Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel (1806–08). In 1806, in imitation of Ancient Rome, Napoléon ordered the construction of a series of monuments dedicated to the military glory of France. The first and largest was the Arc de Triomphe, built at the edge of the city at the Barrière d'Étoile, and not finished before July 1836. He ordered the building of the smaller Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel (1806–1808), copied from the arch of Arch of Septimius Severus and Constantine in Rome, next to the Tuileries Palace. It was crowned with a team of bronze horses he took from the façade of St Mark's Basilica in Venice. His soldiers celebrated his victories with grand parades around the Carrousel. He also commissioned the building of the Vendôme Column (1806–10), copied from the Trajan's Column in Rome, made of the iron of cannon captured from the Russians and Austrians in 1805. At the end of the Rue de la Concorde (given again its former name of Rue Royale on 27 April 1814), he took the foundations of an unfinished church, the Église de la Madeleine, which had been started in 1763, and transformed it into the Temple de la Gloire, a military shrine to display the statues of France’s most famous generals.Héron de Villefosse, René, ‘’Histoire de Paris’’, p. 303 The churches Demolition of the church of Saint-Jean-en-Greve, by Pierre-Antoine Demachy (about 1800) Among the most dismal sights in Napoleonic Paris were the churches which had been closed and wrecked during and after the Revolution. All of the churches were confiscated and made into national property, and were put on sale beginning in 1791. Most of the churches were demolished not by the Revolutionaries, but by real estate speculators, who bought them, took out and sold the furnishings, and demolished the buildings for building materials and to create land for real estate speculation. Twenty-two churches and fifty-one convents were destroyed between 1790 and 1799, and another 12 churches and 22 convents between 1800 and 1814. Convents were particular targets, because they had large buildings and extensive gardens and lands which could be subdivided and sold. Poumies de La Siboutie, a French doctor from Périgord who visited Paris in 1810, wrote: \\"Everywhere there are the hideous imprints of the Revolution. These are the churches and convents half-ruined, dilapidated, abandoned. On their walls, as well as on a large number of public buildings, you can read: \\"National Property for Sale\\".\\"\\" The words could still be read on the facade of Notre Dame, which had been saved, in 1833. When Napoleon was crowned Emperor in Notre Dame Cathedral in 1804, the extensive damage to the building inside and outside was hidden by curtains.Poumies de la Siboutie, Francois Louis, Souvenirs d'un medecin a Paris (1910), Paris, Plon. Cited by Fierro in La Vie des Parisiens sous Napoleon, p. 9 On July 15, 1801, Napoleon signed a Concordat with the Pope, which allowed the thirty-five surviving parish churches and two hundred chapels and other religious institutions of Paris to reopen. The 289 priests remaining in Paris were again allowed to wear their clerical costumes in the street, and the church bells of Paris (those which had not been melted down) rang again for the first time since the Revolution. However, the buildings and property which had been seized from the church was not returned, and the Parisian clergy were kept under the close supervision of the government; the bishop of Paris was nominated by the Emperor, and confirmed by the Pope. Water Prior to Napoleon, the drinking water of Paris came either from the Seine, from wells in the basements of buildings, or from fountains in public squares. Water bearers, mostly from the Auvergne, carrying two buckets on a pole over their shoulder, carried water from the fountains or, since there was a charge for water from fountains, or, if the fountains were too crowded, from the Seine, to homes, for a charge of a sou (five centimes) for a bucket of about fifteen liters. The fountains were supplied with water by two large pumps next to the river, the Samaritaine and Notre-Dame, dating from the 17th century. and by two large steam pumps installed in 1781 at Chaillot and Gros Caillou. In 1800 there were fifty-five fountains for drinking water in Paris, one per each ten thousand Parisians. The fountains only ran at certain hours, were turned off at night, and there was a small charge for each bucket taken. Shortly after taking power, Napoleon told the celebrated chemist, Jean-Antoine Chaptal, who was then the Minister of the Interior: \\"I want to do something great and useful for Paris.\\" Chaptal replied immediately, \\"Give it water\\". Napoleon seemed surprised, but the same evening ordered the first studies of a possible aqueduct from the Ourcq River to the basin of La Valette in Paris. The canal was begun in 1802, and completed in 1808. Beginning in 1812, the water was distributed free to Parisians from the city fountains. In May 1806 Napoleon issued a decree that water should run from the fountains both day and night. He also built new fountains around the city, both small and large, the most dramatic of which were Egytpian Fountain on rue de Sèvres and the Fontaine du Palmier, both still in existence. He also began construction of the Canal St. Martin to further river transportation within the city.Chaptal, Jean Antoine Claude, Mes Souvenirs sur Napoléon, Paris, E. Plon, 1893. Cited by Fierro in La Vie des Parisiens sous Napoléon, p. 38. Napoléon's last water project was, in 1810, the Elephant of the Bastille, a fountain in the shape of a colossal bronze elephant, twenty-four meters high, which was intended for the centre of the Place de la Bastille, but he did not have time to finish it: an enormous plaster mockup of the elephant stood in the square for many years after the emperor's final defeat and exile. Street lighting During the First Empire, Paris was far from being the City of Light. The main streets were dimly illuminated by 4,200 oil lanterns hung from posts, which could be lowered on a cord so they could be lit without a ladder. The number grew to 4,335 by 1807, but was still far from sufficient. One problem was the quantity and quality of the oil being supplied by private contractors; lamps did not burn all night, and often did not burn at all. Also, lamps were placed far apart, so much of the street remained in darkness. For this reason persons going home after the theater or who needed to travel through the city at night hired porte-falots, or torch-bearers, to illuminate their way. Napoleon was furious at the shortcoming: in May 1807, from his military headquarters in Poland, he wrote to Fouché, his Minister of Police, responsible for street lights: \\"I've learned that the streets of Paris are no longer being lit.\\" (May 1); \\"The non-lighting of Paris is becoming a crime, it's necessary to put an end to this abuse, because the public is beginning to complain.\\" (23 May). Transportation Arrival of a diligence from the provinces, by Léopold Boilly (1803) For most Parisians, the sole means of travel was on foot; the first omnibus did not arrive until 1827. For those with a small amount of money, it was possible to hire a fiacre, a one-horse carriage with a driver which carried either two or four passengers. They were marked with numbers in yellow, had two lanterns at night, and were parked at designated places in the city. The cabriolet, a one-horse carriage with a single seat beside the driver, was quicker but offered little protection from the weather. Altogether there were about two thousand fiacres and cabriolets in Paris during the Empire. The fare was fixed at one franc for a journey, or one franc twenty- five centimes for an hour, and one franc fifty for each hour after that. As the traveler Pierre Jouhaud wrote in 1809: \\"Independent of the fixed price, one usually gave a small gratuity which the drivers regarded as their proper tribute; and one could not refuse to give it without hearing the driver vomit a torrent of insults. \\" Wealthier Parisians owned carriages, and well-off foreigners could hire them by the day or month; in 1804 an English visitor hired a carriage and driver for a week for ten Napoleons, or two hundred francs. In all, the narrow streets of Paris were filled with about four thousand private carriages, a thousand carriages for rent, about two thousand fiacres and cabriolets, in addition to thousands of carts and wagons delivering merchandise. There were no police directing traffic, no stop signs, no uniform system of driving on the right or left, no traffic rules, and no sidewalks, which meant both vehicles and pedestrians filled the streets. Leisure Holidays and festivals The wedding procession of Napoleon and Marie-Louise of Austria on the Champs-Élysées (1810). The calendar of Paris under Napoleon was full of holidays and festivals. The first great celebration was devoted to the coronation of the Emperor on 2 December 1804, which was preceded by a procession including Napoleon, Josephine and the Pope through the streets from the Tuileries to the Cathedral of Notre Dame, and followed on December 3 by public dances, tables of food, four fountains filled with wine at the Marché des Innocents, and a lottery giving away thousands of packages of food and wine. . The military victories of the Emperor were given special celebrations with volleys of cannons and military reviews; the victory at the Battle of Austerlitz was celebrated on 22 December 1805; of the Battle of Jena–Auerstedt on 14 October 1805. The 14th of July 1800. the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille, a solemn holiday after the Revolution, was transformed into the Festival of Concord and Reconciliation, and into a celebration of the Emperor's victory at the Battle of Marengo one month earlier. Its main feature was a grand military parade from the Place de la Concorde to the Champs de Mars, and the laying of the first stone of the foundation of a column dedicated to the armies of the Republic, later raised on Place Vendôme. Napoleon, a champion of order, was not comfortable with a holiday which celebrated a violent revolution. The old battle songs of the Revolution, the Marseillaise and the Chant du Depart were not played at the celebration; they were replaced by Hymne a l'Amour by Gluck. From 1801 to 1804, the 14th of July remained a holiday, but was barely celebrated. In 1805, it ceased to be a holiday, and was not celebrated again until 1880. Another major celebration took place on 2 April 1810 to mark the marriage of Napoleon with his new Empress, Marie-Louise of Austria. Napoleon himself organized the details of the event, which he believed marked his acceptance by the royal families of Europe. It included the first illumination of the monuments and bridges of Paris, as well as arches of triumph and a spectacle on the Champs- Élysée, called \\"The Union of Mars and Flore\\"\\", with 580 costumed actors. Besides the official holidays, Parisians again celebrated the full range of religious holidays, which had been abolished during the Revolution. The celebration of Carnival, and masked balls, which had been forbidden during the Revolution, resumed, though under careful police supervision. On Mardi Gras thousands of Parisians in masks and costumes filled the streets, on foot, horseback and in carriages. The 15th of August became a new holiday, the Festival of Saint-Napoleon. It marked the birthday of the Emperor, the Catholic festival of the Assumption, and the anniversary of the Concordat, signed by Napoleon and the Pope on that day in 1801, which allowed the churches of France to reopen. In 1806 the Pope was persuaded to make it an official religious holiday, but its celebration ended with the downfall of the Emperor. The Palais-Royal Promenading in the gallery of the Palais-Royal (1798) It was almost impossible to walk in the narrow streets of Paris, due to the mud and traffic, and the Champs-Élysées did not yet exist, so upper and middle class Parisians took their promenades on the grand boulevards, in the public and private parks and gardens, and above all in the Palais-Royal. The arcades of the Palais-Royal, as described by the German traveler Berkheim in 1807, contained boutiques with glass show windows displaying jewelry, fabrics, hats, perfumes, boots, dresses, paintings, porcelain, watches, toys, lingerie, and every type of luxury goods. In addition there were offices of doctors, dentists and opticians, bookstores, offices for changing money, and salons for dancing, playing billiards and cards. There were fifteen restaurants and twenty-nine cafes, plus stalls which offered fresh waffles from the oven, sweets, cider and beer. The galleries also offered gambling salons and expensive houses of prostitution. The gallery was busy from the early morning, when people came to read the newspapers and do business, and became especially crowded between five and eight in the evening. At eleven, when the shops closed and the theaters finished, a new crowd arrived, along with several hundred prostitutes, seeking clients. The gates were closed at midnight. The Grand Boulevards Next to the Palais-Royal, the most popular places for promenades were the Grands Boulevards, which had, after the Palais-Royal, the greatest concentration of restaurants, theaters, cafes, dance halls, and luxury shops. They were the widest streets in the city, about thirty meters broad, lined with trees and with space for walking and for riding horses, and stretched from la Madeleine to the Bastille. The most crowded part was the Boulevard des Italiens and Boulevard du Temple, where the restaurants and theaters were concentrated. The German traveler Berkheim gave a description of the boulevards as they were in 1807; \\"It is especially from noon until four or five in the afternoon that the boulevards are the busiest. The elegant people of both sexes promenade there then, showing off their charms and their boredom.\\". The most best-known landmarks on the boulevards were the Café Hardi, at rue Cerutti, where businessmen gathered, the Café Chinois and Pavillon d'Hannover, a restaurant and bath house in the form of a Chinese temple; and Frascati's at the corner of rue Richelieu and boulevard Montmartre, famous for its ice creams, elegant furnishings and its garden, where in summer, according to Berkheim, gathered \\"the most elegant and beautiful women of Paris.\\" However, as Berkheim observed, \\"As everything in Paris is about fashion and fantasy, and since everything that is pleasing at this moment must be, for the same reason, considered fifteen days later to be dull and boring,\\" and therefore once the more chic gardens of Tivoli opened, the fashionable Parisians largely abandoned Frascati for a time and went there. In addition to the theaters, panoramas (see below) and cafes, the sidewalks of the boulevards offered a variety of street theater; puppet shows, dogs dancing to music, and magicians performing. Pleasure Gardens and Parks Crowd outside the Jardin Turc, one of the Paris pleasure gardens, by Léopold Boilly (1812). Pleasure gardens were a popular form of entertainment for the middle and upper classes, where, for an admission charge of twenty sous, visitors could sample ice creams, see pantomimes, acrobatics and jugglers, listen to music, dance, or watch fireworks. The most famous was Tivoli, which opened in 1806 between 66 and 106 on rue Saint-Lazare, where the entrance charge was twenty sous. The Tivoli orchestra helped introduce the waltz, a new dance imported from Germany, to the Parisians. The city had three public parks, the Tuileries Garden, the Luxembourg Garden, and the Jardin des Plantes, all of which were popular with promenaders. The theater and opera A crowd outside a theater, by Léopold Boilly The theater was a highly popular form of entertainment for almost all classes of Parisians during the First Empire; there were twenty-one major theaters active, and more smaller stages. At the top of the hierarchy of theaters was the Théâtre Français (today the Comédie-Française), at the Palais-Royal. Only classic French plays were performed there. Tickets ranged in price from 6.60 francs in the first row of boxes down to 1.80 francs for a seat in the upper gallery. Evening dress was required for the premieres of plays. At the other end of the Palais- Royal the Théâtre Montansier, which specialized in vaudeville and comedy. The most expensive ticket there was three francs, and audiences were treated with a program of six different farces and theater pieces. Another highly popular stage was the Théâtre des Variétés on Boulevard Montmartre. on owners of theater regularly invited fifty well-known Paris courtesans to the opening nights, to increase the glamour of the events; the courtesans moved from box to box between acts, meeting their friends and clients. Napoleon often attended the classical theater, but was disdainful and suspicious of popular theater; he did not permit any opposition or ridicule of the army or of himself. Imperial censors reviewed the scripts of all plays, and on 29 July 1807, he issued a royal decree which reduced the number of theaters from twenty-one to nine. The Paris Opera at the time performed in the former theater of Montansier on rue Richelieu, facing the National Library. It was the largest hall in the city, with one thousand seven hundred seats. The aisles and corridors were narrow, the air circulation was minimal, it was badly-lit and had poor visibility, but it was nearly always full. It was not only the rich who attended the opera; seats were available for as little as fifty centimes. Napoleon, as a Corsican, he had a strong preference for Italian opera, and he was suspicious of any other kind. In 1805, he wrote from his army camp at Boulogne to Fouché, his chief of police, \\"What is this piece called Don Juan which they want to perform at the Opera?\\" When he attended a performance, the orchestra played a special fanfare for his entry and his departure. The Opera was also noted for its masked balls, which attracted a large and enthusiastic public. Panoramas The Théâtre des Variétés (left) and two Panoramas (1802)Panoramas, or large-scale paintings mounted in a circular room to give a 360-degree view of a city or an historic event, were very popular in Paris at the beginning of the Empire. The American inventor, Robert Fulton, who was in Paris to try to sell his inventions, the steamboat, a submarine and a torpedo, to Napoleon, bought the patent in 1799 from the inventor of the panorama, the English artist Robert Barker, and opened the first panorama in Paris in July 1799; it was a Vue de Paris by the painters Constant Bourgeois, Denis Fontaine and Pierre Prévost. Prévost went on to make a career of painting panoramas, making eighteen before his death in 1823.La peinture en cinemascope et a 360 degrees, Francois Robichon, Beaux Arts magazine, September 1993 Three rotundas were built on boulevard Montmartre between 1801 and 1804 to show panoramic paintings of Rome, Jerusalem, and other cities. They gave their name to the Passage des Panoramas, where they were located The Guinguettes While the upper and middle class went to the pleasure garden, the working class went to the guinguette. These were cafes and cabarets located just outside the city limits and customs barriers, open on Sundays and holidays, where wine was untaxed and cheaper, and there were three or four musicians playing for dancing. They were most numerous in the villages of Belleville, Montmartre, Vaugirard and Montrouge. Fashion Women Women's fashion during the Empire was set to a large degree by the Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais and her favorite designer, Hippolyte Leroy, who was inspired by the Roman statues of the Louvre and the frescoes of Pompeii. Fashions were also guided by a new magazine, the Journal des Dames et des Modes, with illustrations by the leading artists of the day. The antique Roman style, introduced during the Revolution, continued to be popular but was modified because Napoleon disliked immodesty in women's clothing; low necklines and bare arms were banned. The waist of the Empire gowns was very high, almost under the arms, with a long pleated skirt down to the feet. Corsets were abandoned, and the preferred fabric was mousseline. The main fashion accessory for women was the shawl, inspired by the Orient, made of cashmere or silk, covering the arms and shoulders. Napoleon's military campaigns also influenced fashion; after the Egyptian campaign, women began to wear turbans; after the Spanish campaign, tunics with high shoulders; and after the campaigns in Prussia and Poland, Polish furs and a long coat called a pelisse. They also wore jackets inspired by military uniforms, with epaulettes. In cold weather women wore a redingote, from the English word \\"riding coat\\", borrowed from men's fashion, or, after 1808, a witchoura, a fur coat with a hood.

(1810) The turban became popular after Napoleon's Egyptian campaign. Men During the Revolution, the culotte, or short trousers with silk stockings, and the extravagance fashions, lace and bright colors of the nobility had disappeared, and were replaced by trousers and greater simplicity. The purpose of men's fashion was to show one's wealth and social position; colors were dark and sober. Under the Empire, the culotte returned, worn by Napoleon and his nobles and the wealthy, but trousers were also worn. Men's fashion was strongly influenced by the French aristocrats who returned from exile in England; they introduced English styles, including the large overcoat they called the carsick, going down to the feet; the jacket with a collar going up to the ears; a white silk necktie wrapped around the neck; an English high hat with a broad brim, and high boots. In the late Empire, men's fashion tried for a more military look, with a narrow waist and a chest expanded by several layers of vests.

Daily life Food and drink The staple of the Parisian diet was bread; unlike rural France, where peasants ate dark bread, baked weekly, Parisians preferred a spongy white bread with a firm crust, fresh from the oven, which they commonly ate by soaking it in a meat bouillon. It was similar to the modern baguette, not invented until the 20th century, but took longer to make. Parisians ate an average of 500 grams of bread, or two loaves a day; laborers consumed four loaves a day. Napoleon wanted to avoid the popular uprisings of 1789 caused by bread shortages, so the price of bread was strictly controlled between 1800 and 1814, and was much lower than outside the city. Parisians were very attached to their variety of bread; in times of grain shortages, when the government attempted to substitute cheaper dark breads, the Parisians refused to buy them. Meat was the other main staple of the diet, mostly beef, mutton and pork. There were 580 butchers registered in Paris in 1801, and prices of meat, like bread, were strictly regulated. Fish was another important part of the Parisian diet, particularly fresh fish from the Atlantic, brought to the city from the ports on the coast. Consumption of fresh fish grew during the First Empire, amounting to 55 percent of fish consumption, and it gradually replaced the salted fish which had previously been an important part of the diet, but which were harder to obtain due to the long war at sea between England and France. Seafood accounted for only about ten percent of what Parisians spent on meat; and was slightly less than what they spent on poultry and game. Cheeses and eggs were only a small part of the Parisian diet, since there was no adequate refrigeration and no rapid way to deliver them to the city. The most common cheeses were those of the nearest region, Brie, and then those from Normandy. Fresh fruits and vegetables from the Paris region, potatoes, and dried vegetables, such as lentils and white beans, completed the diet. Wine was a basic part of the Parisian diet, ranking with bread and meat. Fine wines arrived from Bordeaux, ordinary wines were brought to the city in large casks from Burgundy and Provence; lesser quality wines came from vineyards just outside the city, in Montmartre and Belleville. Beer consumption was small, was only eight percent of that of wine, and cider only three percent. The most common strong alcoholic beverage was eau-de-vie, with as much as twenty-seven percent alcohol. It was most popular among the working class Parisians. Coffee had been introduced to Paris in about 1660, and came from Martinique and the IÎe de Bourbon, now Réunion. The English blockade of French ports cut off the supply, and Parisians were forced to drink substitutes made from the chicory or acorns. The blockade also cut off the supplies of chocolate, tea and sugar. Napoleon encouraged the growing of sugar beets to replace cane sugar, and in February 1812 he went himself to taste the products of the first sugar beet refineries opened just outside the city, at Passy and Chaillot. Cafés and restaurants A game of checkers in the Café Lamblin in the Palais-Royal, by Boilly (before 1808) There were more than four thousand cafés in Paris in 1807, but due to the English naval blockade they were rarely able to obtain coffee, sugar, or rum, their main staples. Many of them were transformed into glaciers, which served ice cream and sorbet. One of the most prominent was the Café de Paris, located next to the statue of Henry IV on the Pont Neuf, facing Place Dauphine. The other well-known cafés were clustered in the galleries of the Palais Royal; these included the Café de Foix, the Café de Chartres, the Café de la Rotonde, which had a pavilion in the garden; the Café Corazza, where one could find newspapers from around Europe; and the Café des Mille Colonnes. The German traveler Berkheim described Café Foix: \\"this café, which normally brings together only high society, is always full, especially after the performances of the Théâtre français and the Montansier. They take their ice creams and sorbets there; and very rarely does one find any women among them.\\" In the cellars beneath the Palais Royal were several other cafés for a less aristocratic clientele, where one could eat a full meal for twenty-five centimes and enjoy a show; The Café Sauvage had dancers in exotic costumes from supposedly primitive countries; the Café des Aveugles had an orchestra of blind musicians; and the Café des Variétés had musicians in one grotto and vaudeville theater performances in another. Berkheim wrote: \\"The society is very mixed; composed ordinarily of petit bourgeois, workers, soldiers, servants, and women with large round bonnets and large skirts of wool... there is a continual movement of people coming and going.\\" The first restaurants in the modern sense, with elaborate cuisine and service, had appeared in Paris just before the Revolution. By 1807, according to Berkheim, there were about two thousand restaurants in Paris in 1807, of all categories. Most of the highest-quality and most expensive restaurants were located in the Palais- Royal; these included Beauvilliers, Brigaud, Legacque, Léda, and Grignon. Others were on the boulevards de Temple or Italiens. The Rocher de Cancale, known for its oysters, was on rue Montorgueil near the markets of Les Halles, while Ledoyen was at the western edge of the city, on the Champs-Élysées. The menu of one restaurant, Véry, described by the German traveler August Kotzebue in 1804, gives an idea of the cuisine of the top restaurants; it began with a choice of nine kinds of soup, followed by seven kinds of pâté, or platters of oysters; then twenty-seven kinds of hors d'oeuvres, mostly cold, including sausages, marinated fish, or choucroute. The main course followed, a boiled meat with a choice of twenty sauces, or a choice of almost any possible variety of a beefsteak. After this was a choice of twenty-one entrées of poultry or wild birds, or twenty-one dishes of veal or mutton; then a choice of twenty-eight different fish dishes; then a choice of fourteen different roast birds; accompanied by a choice of different entremets, including asparagus, peas, truffles, mushrooms, crayfish or compotes. After this came a choice of thirty-one different desserts. The meal was accompanied by a choice made of twenty-two red wines and seventeen white wines; and afterwards came coffee and a selection of sixteen different liqueurs. The city had many more modest restaurants, where one could dine for 1.50 francs, without wine. Employees with small salaries could find many restaurants which served a soup and main course, with bread and a carafe of wine, for between fifteen and twenty-one francs a week, with two courses with bread and a carafe. For students in the Left Bank, there were restaurants like Flicoteau, on rue de la Parcheminerie, which had no tablecloths or napkins, where diners ate at long tables with benches, and the menu consisted of bowls of bouillon with pieces of meat. Diners usually brought their own bread, and paid five or six centimes for their meal.Poumiés de La Siboutie, François Louis, Souvenirs d'un médecin a Paris, 1910, pages 92-93. Religion Just fifty days after seizing power, on 28 December 1799, Napoleon took measures to establish better relations with the Catholic Church in Paris. All the churches which had not yet been sold as national property or torn down, fourteen in number in January 1800, with four added during the year, were to be returned to religious use. Eighteen months later, with the signing of the Concordat between Napoleon and the Pope, churches were allowed to hold mass, ring their bells, and priests could appear in their religious attire on the streets. After the Reign of Terror, priests were hard to find in Paris; of 600 priests who had taken the oath to the government in 1791, only 75 remained in 1800. Many had to be brought to the city from the provinces to bring the number up to 280. When the bishop of Paris died in 1808, Napoleon tried to appoint his uncle, Cardinal Fesch, to the position, but Pope Pious VII, in conflict with Napoleon over other matters, rejected him. Fesch withdrew his candidacy and another ally of Napoleon, Bishop Maury, took his place until Napoleon's downfall in 1814. The number of Protestants in Paris under the Empire was very small; Napoleon accorded three churches for the Calvinists and one church for the Lutherans. The Jewish religious community was also very small, with 2733 members in 1808. They did not have a formal temple until 1822, after the Empire, with the inauguration of the synagogue on rue Notre-Dame-du-Nazareth. , Education Schools, collèges and lycées During Old Regime, the education of young Parisians until university age was done by the Catholic church. The Revolution destroyed the old system, but did not have time to create a new one. Lucien Bonaparte, the Minister of the Interior, went to work to create a new system. A bureau of public instruction for the prefecture of the Seine was established on 15 February 1804. Charity schools for poorer children were registered, and had a total of eight thousand students, and were mostly taught by Catholic brothers. An additional four hundred schools for middle class and wealthy Parisian students, numbering fourteen thousand, were registered. An 1802 law formalized a system of collèges and lycées for older children. The principal subjects taught were mathematics and Latin, with a smaller number of hours given to Greek, and one hour of French a week, history, and a half-hour of geography a week. Arithmetic, geometry and physics were the only sciences taught. Philosophy was added as a subject in 1809. About eighteen hundred students, mostly from the most wealthy and influential families, attended the four most famous lycées in Paris in 1809; the Imperial (now Louis le Grand); Charlemagne; Bonaparte (now Condorcet); and Napoléon (now Henry IV). These competed with a large number of private academies and schools. The University and the Grandes Écoles The University of Paris before the Revolution had been most famous as a school of theology, charged with enforcing religious orthodoxy; it was closed in 1792, and was not authorized to re-open until 1808, with five faculties; theology, law, medicine, mathematics, physics and letters. Napoleon made it clear what its purpose was, in a letter to the rectors in 1811; \\"the University does not have as its sole purpose to train orators and scientists; above all it owes to the Emperor the creation of faithful and devoted subjects.\\". In the academic year 1814-15, it had a total of just 2500 students; 70 in letters, 55 in sciences, 600 in medicine, 275 in pharmacy, and 1500 in law. The law students were being trained to be magistrates, lawyers, notaries and other administrators of the Empire. A degree in law took three years, or four to earn a doctorate, and cost students about one thousand francs; a degree in theology required 110 francs, in letters or sciences, 250 francs. While he tolerated the University, the schools that Napoleon valued the most were the École Militaire, the military school, and the Grandes Écoles, which had been founded at the end of the old regime or during the Revolutionary period; the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers; the École des Ponts et Chausées, (Bridges and highways); the École des Mines de Paris (school of Mines), the École Polytechnique, and the École Normale Supérieure, which trained the engineers, officers, teachers, administrators and organizers he wanted for the Empire. He re-organized them, often militarized them, and gave them the highest prestige in the French educational system. Books and the press Freedom of the press had been proclaimed at the beginning of the Revolution, but had quickly disappeared during the Reign of Terror, and was not restored by the succeeding governments or by Napoleon. In 1809, Napoleon told his Council of State: \\"The printing presses are an arsenal, and should not be put at the disposition of anyone...The right to publish is not a natural right; printing as a form of instruction is a public function, and therefore the State can prevent it.\\" Supervision of the press was the responsibility of the Ministry of the Police, which had separate bureaus to oversee newspapers, plays, publishers and printers, and bookstores. The Prefecture of Police had its own bureau which also kept an eye on printers, bookstores and newspapers. All books published had to be approved by the censors, and between 1800 and 1810 one-hundred sixty titles were banned and seized by the police. The number of bookstores in Paris dropped from 340 in 1789 to 302 in 1812; in 1811 the number of publishing houses was limited by law to no more than eighty, almost all in the neighborhood around the University. Censorship of newspapers and magazines was even stricter. in 1800 Napoleon closed down sixty political newspapers, leaving just thirteen. In February 1811 he decided that this was still too many, and reduced the number to just eight newspapers, almost supporting him. One relatively independent paper, the Journal de l'Empire continued to exist, and by 1812 was the most popular newspaper, with 32,000 subscriptions. Newspapers were also heavily taxed, and subscriptions were expensive; an annual subscription cost about 56 francs in 1814. Because of the high cost of newspapers, many Parisians went to cabinets litteraires or reading salons, which numbered about one hundred and fifty. For a subscription of about six francs a month, readers could find a selection of newspapers, plus billiards, cards or chess games. Some salons displayed caricatures of the leading figures of the day. The arts The Army Takes an oath to the Emperor by Jacques- Louis David, shown at the 1810 salon. David removed Josephine from the painting, after Napoleon divorced her. Napoleon supported the arts, as long as the artists supported him. He gave substantial commissions to painters, sculptors and even poets to depict his family and the great moments of the Empire. The principal showcase for paintings was the Paris Salon, which had been started in 1667 and from 1725 took place in the Salon carré of the Louvre, from which it took its name. It was an annual event from 1795 until 1801, then was held every two years. It usually opened in September or October, and as the number of paintings grew, it occupied both the Salon carré and the Gallery of Apollo. In 1800, 651 paintings were shown; in 1812, 1,353 paintings were on display. The stars of the salon were the history painters, Pierre-Narcisse Guérin, Antoine-Jean Gros, Jacques-Louis David, Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson and Pierre-Paul Prud'hon, who painted large canvases of the events of the Empire and the heroes and heroines of ancient Rome. The Salon was one of the major social events of the year, and attracted huge crowds. The salon had its own political sensitivities; On 22 October 1808 the director of the Louvre, Vivant Denon, hid a portrait of the writer and philosopher François-René de Chateaubriand when the Emperor visited the Salon, since Chateaubriand had criticized the Emperor. Knowing what had been done, Napoleon asked to see it. The divorce of Napoleon and Josephine in 1810 was an even more sensitive subject; she had to be removed from the paintings in the salon where she was portrayed. David removed her from his work The Distribution of the Eagles, leaving an empty space; the painter Jean-Baptiste Regnault, however, refused to take her out of his painting of the wedding of Jérôme Bonaparte. The most popular art market in Paris was the gallery of the Palais-Royal, where more than fifty artists had their small studios and showrooms. The artists in the Gallery worked for a wide clientele; Parisians could have their portrait painted for thirty francs, or a profile for twelve francs. Many of the artists also had their residences there, on the fifth floor. The End of the Empire The Battle of Paris The Russian army, led by Czar Alexander I, enters Paris by the Port Saint-Denis on 31 March 1814 In January 1814, after Napoleon's decisive defeat at the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813, the Allied armies of Austria, Prussia and Russia, with over five hundred thousand men, invaded France and headed for Paris. Napoleon departed the Tuileries Palace for the front on January 24, leaving behind the Empress and his son; he never saw them again. He commanded only seventy thousand men, but managed a skillful campaign. . Within Paris, most Parisians were desperately tired of the war. Since the time of Louis XIV, Paris had no walls or other major defensive works. Napoleon's own foreign minister, Prince Talleyrand, was in secret communication with Czar Alexander I; on March 10 he wrote to him, saying that Paris was undefended, and urging him to march directly to the city. On March 29, the Empress Marie-Louise and her son, escorted by 1200 soldiers of the Old Guard, left Paris, heading for the Chateau of Blois in the Loire Valley. On March 30, a combined Russian, Austrian and Prussian army with 57,000 soldiers under Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, attacked Paris, which was defended by Marshal Auguste de Marmont and Marshal Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise, with forty-one thousand men. Schwarzenberg sent a message to the French commanders, threatening to destroy the city if they did not surrender. After a day of bitter but indecisive fighting in Montmartre, Belleville, at the barriers of Clichy and Patin and the quarries of the Buttes de Chaumont, with about seven thousand soldiers killed on each side, Mortier marched his remaining troops southwest out of the city, while Marmont, with eleven thousand men, entered into secret negotiations with Allies. At two o'clock in the morning on 31 March, Marmont marched his soldiers to an agreed place, was surrounded by Allied soldiers, and surrendered his forces and the city. Napoleon heard the news when he was at Juvisy, just fourteen miles from the city; he went immediately to Fontainebleau, where he arrived at 6:00 a.m. on the 31st, and abdicated the throne on April 4. The Russian army, led by Alexander I, entered Paris by the Porte Saint-Denis on 31 March. Some Parisians welcomed them, waving white flags and wearing white as a sign of good will. Spies in Paris for King Louis XVIII, who waiting in exile in England, misunderstood the symbolism of the white flags and reported to him that the Parisians were waving the symbolic color of the Bourbon dynasty, and were eagerly awaiting his return. Talleyrand welcomed the Czar at his own residence; he had a list of ministers for a provisional government already prepared. Orchestrated by Talleyrand, on 1 April, the President of the General Council of the Seine appealed for Louis XVIII to return; the French Senate echoed the appeal on 6 April. The King returned to the city on 3 May, where he was welcomed with joy by royalists but indifference by most Parisians, who simply wanted peace. The return of the Monarchy and the Hundred Days Paris was occupied by Prussian, Russian, Austrian and British soldiers, who camped in the Bois de Boulogne and the open land along the Champs Élysées, and remained for several months, while the King restored the royal government and replaced Bonapartists with his own ministers, many of whom returned from exile with him. The discontent of the Parisians grew as the new government, following the guidance of the new religious authorities named by the King, required all shops and markets to close and banned any sort of entertainment or leisure activities on Sundays. The King was particularly unpopular with the former soldiers and with workers, who suffered from high unemployment. Taxes were raised while British imports were allowed to enter without duty, with the result that the Parisian textile industry very quickly was largely shut down. Early in March 1815 Parisians were astonished by the news that Napoleon had left his exile on Elba and was back in France, on the way to Paris. Louis XVIII fled the city on 19 March, and 20 March Napoleon was back in the Tuileries Palace. Enthusiasm for the Emperor was high among the workers and former soldiers, but not among the general population, who feared another long war. During the Hundred Days between his return from Elba and his defeat at Waterloo, Napoleon spent three months in Paris, busily reconstructing his regime. He organized grand military reviews and parades, restored the tricolor flag. Wishing to show himself as a constitutional monarch rather than a dictator, he abolished censorship, but personally reviewed the budgets of the Paris theaters. He resumed work on several of his unfinished projects, including the Elephant fountain at the Bastille, a new market at Saint-Germain, the foreign ministry building at the Quai d'Orsay and a new wing of the Louvre. The theater conservatory, closed by the Bourbons, was re-opened with the actor François-Joseph Talma on the faculty, and Denon was restored to his position as director of the Louvre. By April 1815, however, enthusiasm for the Emperor diminished, as war appeared inevitable. Conscription was extended to married men, and only the soldiers cheered the Emperior when he passed. A huge ceremony was held on June 1 on the Champs de Mars, celebrating the referendum approving the Acte Additionnel, a new law establishing him as a constitutional monarch. Napoleon wore a purple robe and addressed a crowd of 15,000 seated guests and a crowd of hundred thousand more persons standing behind them. The ceremony featured a hundred cannon salute, a religious procession, solemn oaths, songs, and a military parade; it was the last great Napoleonic event held in the city, before the Emperor departed for the front on June 12 and his eventual defeat at Waterloo on June 18.

Each train was shortened down from 10 to eight cars during conversion.  2nd batch  Class 321000 (second batch) train 321-18 The second batch of Class 321000 trains were introduced following the Gyeongui·Jungang Line's eastward extension from Paldang to Guksu Station. The second batch trains were formed from the surplus of cars resulting from the shortening of trains 321-01~321-14 from 10 to eight cars; 28 cars were left over for an available total of four additional trains (4 new cars were made to bring the total amount of available cars to 32 cars, or four 8-car trains). The second batch trains are numbered 321-15~321-18. All trains had their overhead LED display monitors replaced with LCD display monitors on the sides (above the doors). Train 321-18 uses four newly made cars due to the lack of available cars.  3rd batch  Class 321000 (third batch) train 321-20 The third batch of Class 321000 trains were introduced following the Gyeongui·Jungang Line's eastward extension from Guksu to Yongmun Station. The third batch trains were manufactured and introduced in 2009, few months prior to the opening of the final eastward extension. The third batch trains are numbered 321-19~321-21. All trains were delivered with LCD display monitors on the sides (above the doors), and feature newer exterior LED destination signs that are capable of scrolling. The front end was modified, and had been the blueprint of all subsequent Korail metro cars for the Seoul Metropolitan Subway from 2009 to 2018. Trains 321-20~321-21 feature flip-up seats and bike racks.  Refurbishment  In 2016, many trains were retrofitted with LED headlights.  Gangway refurbishment  From August 2011, all trains gradually received gangway refurbishments (similar refurbishments were also done in Class 311000 trains). Automatic doors were installed to replace the older, manually opened gangway doors. After refurbishment, gangway doors could be automatically opened by the push of a button.

His is still the largest collection of reptile and amphibian specimens donated to Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.  Biography  Born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, England, on 5 September 1944, Whitaker emigrated to New Zealand with his family in 1951, and became a naturalised New Zealander in 1976. He grew up in Upper Hutt, attending St. Patrick's College, Silverstream, and later gaining his Bachelor of Science degree majoring in zoology from Victoria University of Wellington in 1966. He married and fathered two children, and lived in Motueka for much of his life. Whitaker died from a heart attack while mountain-biking near Motueka on 20 February 2014. Herpetology work Whitaker's passion for reptiles was evident from an early age, collecting early specimens of skink while growing up in Upper Hutt. While on a family holiday in the Marlborough Sounds, the 12-year-old Whitaker had gone out to look for geckos. Upon learning of his interest, a publican in Saint Arnaud gave him a jar of geckos pickled in vodka. In 1966 he joined the Ecology Division of the DSIR, New Zealand's main scientific research institute at the time, as a lab technician and later research scientist, specialising in reptiles. By the time he left in 1977, the department's collection had grown to over 2000 specimens and was donated to the New Zealand national museum. Whitaker helped found the Society for Research on Amphibians and Reptiles in New Zealand in 1987 and was a long- serving editor of its journal, SRARNZ Notes. Both Whitaker himself and his distinguished work over many decades were widely respected by New Zealand ecologists and biologists. He produced about 230 published papers and scientific and conservation reports, mentored many in the field, and was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2010 Queen's Birthday Honours, for services to herpetology. He remarked at the time that one of his greatest achievements had been to recognise early on the predatory threat that rats pose to native reptile species, confirmed by later research and pest eradication programmes. Whitaker has one species of skink named after him, Oligosoma whitakeri (Whitaker's skink), and by himself he named one species Mokopirirakau kahutarae, Whitaker's sticky-toed gecko or the black- eyed gecko.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Whitaker, A.H.\\", p. 284). As co-author, he has participated in describing and naming approximately two dozen other new species of reptiles: Bavayia exsuccida, Bavayia goroensis, Bavayia pulchella, Caledoniscincus constellatus, Caledoniscincus pelletieri, Correlophus belepensis, Dierogekko baaba, Dierogekko inexpectatus, Dierogekko insularis, Dierogekko kaalaensis, Dierogekko koniambo, Dierogekko nehoueensis, Dierogekko poumensis, Dierogekko thomaswhitei, Eurydactylodes occidentalis, Kanakysaurus viviparus, Kanakysaurus zebratus, Lioscincus vivae, Marmorosphax boulinda, Marmorosphax kaala, Marmorosphax taom, Mniarogekko jalu, Nannoscincus koniambo, Nannoscincus manautei, Oligosoma hoparatea, Phaeoscincus taomensis, Phasmasaurus maruia, and Sigaloseps pisinnus. In addition, his specimen collection has provided holotypes for several other species, including the skinks Oligosoma chloronoton, Oligosoma stenotis, Oligosoma longipes, and Oligosoma townsi.

It was established by Fray Andres del Espiritu Santo in 1830 and constructed under the patronage of the Holy Infant Jesus or Santo Niño. History The church had withstood several natural and man-made calamities over the past decades. The Great Flood of 1832 submerged the convent of the church. It forced the residents to settle at the upper levels, where they are now at present. The church was struck by a lightning in 1852. The fire ignited spontaneously because of the cogon grass stored inside the structure. Padre Mariano Torrente repaired the church during his term from 1858 to 1872. After 49 years, the Flood of Don Nicolas occurred in 1881, almost submerging the , Olumbuaya Hill. From 1893 to 1898, several repair works were done by Padre Epifanio Vergara. The Flood of Don Osting happened at Mabini in 1957. More than 700 people living at low-lying areas were affected by the flooding. In December 12, 1999, the 1830 church was torn down by a strong earthquake. Few structural components and foundation remained intact. However, majority of the stone walls, facade, and the altar collapsed. The old church of Mabini was restored and blessed on 2005. On the other hand, the old convent and the parish office were transferred to the other side of the church in 2006. This side used to be a chapel before the restoration of the new Mabini church. Architectural features The church was built in the early renaissance architectural style. Its facade is characterized by large Doric columns on pedestals covering the whole height of the first level. The paired columns at the center flanked the main entrance up to the pediment. There were semi-circular windows on the upper walls of the second level. A statued niche and circular windows on the sides fill the walls of the pediments. The bell tower on the left is a later addition.

The idol of the Chilay Devi Maa installed in the temple is a form of the total goddess of the Pandavas and their dynasty Tanwar or Tomar Rajput, People from Tanwar Rajput society worship Maa Surund as Kuldevi. The idol is installed in a cave Legend has it that in the 16th century, the Mughal emperor Akbar brought a stock of liquor on camels after hearing that the idol of the mother idol was consumed. But each time halfway up the temple, the wines kept on camels used to be empty. Seeing this, the Mughal emperor Akbar had to bow down. After this, Akbar got the temple renovated. The idol is situated in a cave on the hill. To reach it, one has to pass through seven gates. Earlier there used to be only one gate. While the remaining six gates are Mughal carpet. It is said that these gates were built by Akbar. This trend continued even during Aurangzeb. The Mother's Footprint It is believed that in the night time, Mata Rani travels on a lion herself.

It is one of the simplest polydiacetylenes that has been synthesized, having only iodine atoms as side chains. It is created by 1,4 topochemical polymerization of diiodobutadiyne. It has many implications in the field of polymer chemistry as it can be viewed as a precursor to other polydiacetylenes by replacing iodine atoms with other side chains using organic synthesis, or as an iodinated form of the carbon allotrope carbyne. Structure The backbone of PIDA is highly conjugated and allows for the formation of an extended pi system along the length of the polymer. This property of PIDA allows it to transport electricity and act as a molecular wire or an organic semiconductor. Considering PIDA's backbone and the fact that Iodine atoms can easily undergo elimination, it is conceivable that PIDA can be subjected to full reductive deiodination in the presence of a Lewis base, such as pyrrolidine to yield carbyne. Synthesis Structure of co- crystals. The oxalamide host is shown in red and diiodobutadiyne in blue. PIDA is synthesized from diiodobutadiyne via 1,4 topochemical polymerization. In order to meet the geometric requirements for polymerization, a host–guest strategy is used by combining a host molecule and diiodobutadiyne in solution and allowing co-crystallization to occur. This can be utilized because hosts that are most commonly used are able to bond to the diyne monomer by halogen bonding from the lewis acidic iodine atom to a lewis basic nitrogen of the host (usually a nitrile or pyridine). In order to give a proper repeat distance to the monomers (5 Å), the hosts also contain oxalamide groups that create a hydrogen bonding network throughout the crystal. In most instances, polymerization is spontaneous upon crystallization or exposure to UV radiation/pressure.

In the first period, when printing was organized by Božidar Vuković, the editors and printers were Hieromonk Pahomije (1519–21) and Hierodeacon Mojsije (1536–40). In 1560 Božidar's son Vićenco Vuković inherited the printing house and for a year only reprinted his father's books. In 1561 he started printing his own publications. Initially they were edited and printed by Stefan Marinović and later by Jakov of Kamena Reka. The books printed in Vuković printing house were srbulje, liturgical books in Serbo- Slavonic, the Serbian written language between the 12th century and the 1830s. Vuković printing house printed the largest number of srbulje and was the first printing house that printed srbulje on parchment. The books printed in Vuković printing house were distributed by Ragusan traders over the territory of Balkans under the Ottoman control, i.e. Belgrade, Nicopolis, Vidin etc. Mileševa was center for their distribution. They were richly decorated, very popular and had significant influence on printers of books on Russian, Greek and Romanian language.  History  In period 1519—1560 this printing house was owned by Božidar Vuković who engaged printers and organized printing in it. After his death in 1560 it was inherited by Božidar's son Vićenco who continued to organize printing of the books in it.  Under Božidar Vuković  During Božidar's life this printing house was operational in two periods, in 1519/1520—1521 and in 1536—1540 and printed some of the first srbulje (Cyrillic books on Serboslavonic language, Serbian recension of Church Slavonic). In the first period 1519/1520—1521 three books were printed (Psalter, Liturgijar and Molitvenik or Zbornik). The editing and printing was done by Hieromonk Pahomije. In second period 1536—1540 two books were printed (2nd edition of Molitvenik or Zbornik and praznični Minej or Sabornik). The most luxurious and lengthiest edition was Praznični Minej. In this second period the printing was done by Hierodeacon Mojsije. The books printed in Vuković printing house under Božidar Vuković had rich decorations made by woodcut. Mileševa (a Serbian Orthodox monastery located near Prijepolje, in southwest Serbia) was center for distribution of books printed in Vuković printing house.  Under Vićenco Vuković  In 1560 Bozidar's son Vićenco Vuković inherited the printing house. His father's books were so popular that until 1561 Vićenco had only published reprints of his fathers books, such as Oktoih Petoglasnik, and successfully sold them. In 1561 Vićenco engaged Stefan Marinović to operate the printing press and first book he printed was Posni Triod. In 1566 Jakov of Kamena Reka printed the Book of hours (Часослов) of 710 pages. Printing activities of Vićenco Vuković announced beginning of the decline of publishing and printing of Serbian books in Venetian Republic, although it had been risen on very high level by Božidar Vuković.  Legacy  Books printed in this printing house significantly influenced, directly or indirectly, to Russian, Greek and particularly Romanian language printed books because some of Božidars woodcuts were copied by printers who printed books on these languages.

Although it is also used to describe the earlier lineages that emerged in Northern India from sixth century onward. In the eleventh century, the term \\"Rajaputra\\" appeared as a non-hereditary designation for royal officials. Gradually, the Rajputs emerged as a powerful social class comprising people from a variety of ethnic and geographical backgrounds. The membership of this class became largely hereditary, although new claims to Rajput status continued to be made in the later centuries. Several Rajput-ruled kingdoms played a significant role in many regions of central and northern India until the twentieth century. Rajput are generally considered to be divided into three primary vansh. Suryavanshi, the Solar dynasty or the Ikshvaku dynasty, denotes descent from the solar deity Surya, the prominent kings and emperors belonging to this royal house are Dilīpa, Raghu, Aja, Dasharatha, Rama, Harishchandra, Sagara, etc.; Chandravanshi (Somavanshi) from the lunar deity Chandra, the prominent kings and emperors belonging to this royal house are Dushyanta, Bharata, Shantanu, Bhishma, Yudhisthir, Parikshit, etc.; and Agnivanshi from the fire deity Agni. The Rajput population and the former Rajput states are found in north, west, central and east India in the present day state of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Jammu, Uttarakhand, Bihar Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh. According to medieval legends, there are four Agnivanshi clans: Chauhans (Chahamanas), Parihars (Pratihara), Parmars (Paramaras) and Solankis (Chaulukyas). It is believed that Parashurama slaughtered Kshatriyas (warriors) 21 times. The only escapees were those who disguised themselves, those who fled leaving behind their swords and those who fell at his feet. The absence of any warriors led to a Dark Age, where demons increased in number, Vedas came to be trampled under their feet, and Hinduism was forgotten. The sages then visited Parashurama's cave on Mount Abu. There, all the gods, men and nāgas assembled and came up with a plan to destroy the demons. Vashistha erected a fire altar and worshiped Shiva, who appeared before the sages. But the demons disrupted the ceremony by throwing impurities like blood, flesh and garbage on the altar. Twenty sages, including their leader Vashistha, then invoked Brahma and Shiva. They erected a new altar and conducted a fresh ceremony, singing hymns from the Sama Veda. To get rid of these demons, Vashistha performed a homa ritual. This led to the appearance of a hero named Pratihara (\\"door-keeper\\"), who Vashistha placed on the road leading to the palace. After this, another hero named Solanki (Chalukka) appeared from the hollowed palm of Brahma. Finally, a third hero appeared, who sage named Pavara (or Paramara, \\"slayer of the enemy\\"). However, these three heroes were not able to stop the demons. Vashistha then dug up a new fire pit, and made yet another offering to the fire, to conjure a new hero. This four-armed hero held a sword, a shield, a bow, and an arrow. Vashistha named him Chahavana or Chauhan, performed his coronation with Vedic hymns, and then ordered him to fight the demons. Parashurama and Shakti blessed the newly created heroes. The sage Bhrigu told him that he would be protected by the goddess Shakti in his endeavours to kill the demons. This, four armed hero warriors defeated the demons. The goddess protected Chohan from all dangers: every time he fell at her feet, his strength doubled and he was able to slay the demons. The goddess came to be known as Ashapuri because she fulfilled the hopes (\\"asha\\") of the sages. The Bachchas is the gotra of Agniwanshi Rajputs. Bachchas and vats are different gotra of Agniwanshi Chauhan Rajput. People of these gotras are the descendants of Prithviraj Chauhan. Most of the people related to these gotras lives in Noida , Haridwar, Bijnor districts of Western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, etc. The vats and bachchas both the gotra comes under Agniwanshi Rajput. Many Bachchas or Bachal Rajputs are said to get the name from queen Bachchal (Hindi: बाछल), who was mother of famous folk-deity, Jaharveer Gogaji. Goga (Hindi: गोगा) was born to queen Bachchal (the daughter of a Rajput ruler, Kanwarpala ruled over Sirsa in present-day Haryana) and king Zewar in Dadrewa, the ancient capital of Chauhan Rulers in the Churu district of Rajasthan. According to another legend Gogaji was son of a Chauhan Rajput Ruler named Vacha or Juar, whose wife Bachal (Hindi: बाछल) was from Tomar/Tuar clan. The apparent reference to parents of Gogaji is same except slight difference in names due to different dialects being spoken those part of Rajasthan and Haryana.

It is part of a series of novels by Smith set to Ancient Egypt and follows the fate of the Egyptian Kingdom through the eyes of Taita, a multi-talented and highly skilled eunuch slave. Plot summary The story is set a few years after River God. Pharaoh Tamose has succeeded in securing a capital at Thebes in Upper Egypt, and the brilliant eunuch Taita is his chief advisor, even as he continues to try to expel the Hyksos from Egypt. Taita receives intelligence that the Hyksos and the Minoans have signed a secret treaty, and that the Minoans are sending a large shipment of silver to a fortress they have constructed on Hyksos territory in an effort to expand their maritime empire. With the help of the young captain Zaras, Taita successfully undertakes a covert operation to steal the Minoan treasure while blaming the theft on the Hyksos, breaking their treaty and enriching Pharaoh at a single stroke. With the vast treasure obtained thanks to Taita's efforts, Tamose now attempts to recruit allies among the neighbouring nations against the Hyksos. He plans to make an alliance with the Minoans by giving their ruler, the Supreme Minos, his sisters Tehuti and Bekatha in marriage. Taita is to lead the journey, and is delegated Pharaoh's full authority when negotiating with foreign rulers. Tehuti meets Zaras when these plans are announced, and they quickly fall in love, much to Taita's chagrin, and she arranges to have Zaras join them in their long journey to Crete to marry the Minoan ruler. Since the most direct route to the Minoan homeland of Crete would require passing through Lower Egypt, the domain of the Hyksos, Taita and the princesses have to instead use an indirect route across the Red Sea and the deserts of Arabia to Babylon. He is then to attempt to convince King Nimrod of Babylon to likewise ally with Egypt, and from there proceed to Crete. The journey across the Arabian desert is dangerous: Tehuti is abducted by a band of brigands, but she is rescued by Taita and Zaras. Tehuti manages to convince Taita to allow her romance with Zaras to proceed, reminding him of what he had once done for her mother Lostris and her true father Tanus. They arrive at Babylon, where they find that Nimrod rules over an impoverished kingdom, as his father squandered much of the country's wealth in grandiose building projects meant to woo the goddess Ishtar to descending to earth. Leaning on the authority delegated to him by Pharaoh, Taita promises Nimrod the funds he will need to rebuild his military as an inducement for an alliance. He also purchases a small flotilla of ships for them to sail to Crete. While at Babylon, the goddess Ishtar, using her Sumerian name Inanna appears to Taita in a vision. She tells him that he is one of her chosen, and that he is actually a demigod with a human mother and a divine father. The Minoan ambassador to Babylon meets with Taita and accompanies them on the final leg of their journey. After a perilous voyage across the Mediterranean, Taita and the princesses arrive at the Minoan capital of Knossos, where they meet the Supreme Minos, who is a sinister, gigantic man who always wears a bull mask. He marries the two princesses who are promptly sequestered in the royal seraglio. Taita is anguished when he learns that he will probably not hear from them ever again, but consoles himself that he has successfully sealed the alliance with the Minoans, and keeps himself busy by planning the joint operations against the Hyksos. Taita does, however, eventually receive news of the princesses through a Minoan slave girl who has become their lady-in-waiting. He learns that they, like the other women in the royal harem, have not seen the Supreme Minos since they were married. However, after a violent earthquake, a group of the royal wives was summoned to the high temple by the Supreme Minos and have not been seen again since. Successful raids against the Hyksos are conducted by Taita and Zaras with the help of their Minoan allies. After one such sortie, Taita has a vision of Inanna, and she warns him that the princesses are in danger. Taita and Zaras sail back to Crete with all speed, and weather a massive tidal wave along the way. They find that volcanoes on the island have begun erupting, and quickly search for Tehuti and Bekatha, and learn they have been taken to the high temple as human sacrifices to appease their god Cronus and prevent him from destroying Crete. They are to be sacrificed by being gored to death by a monstrous bull representing the god. Taita and Zaras arrive in time, and Tehuti manages to slay the bull with a sword dropped to her by Taita. They narrowly escape as volcanoes and earthquakes utterly destroy the once mighty Minoan Empire. Tehuti and Bekatha refuse to return to Upper Egypt with Taita, saying that Pharaoh will just attempt to use them again as royal brides to some other monarch. They leave for one of the Aegean islands with Zaras and another Egyptian officer who became Bekatha's lover, and have Taita tell Pharaoh that they all perished in the destruction of Knossos.

Monsey was admitted to the Royal College of Physicians in 1723. He then practised in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, where he never earned more than £300 a year, but married well. Move to London Monsey was lucky enough to be called to treat Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin, who was taken ill with apoplexy on the way to Newmarket. Godolphin – taken with Monsey's skill, raucous sense of humour and insolent familiarity – persuaded him to move to London, where he introduced him to patients such as the prime minister, Sir Robert Walpole, Lord Chesterfield and other prominent Whigs. He also built up literary connections. For many years he paid court to the bluestocking Elizabeth Montagu, writing rhymed letters to her in the style of Swift. His friendship with David Garrick was broken after a quarrel. Dr Johnson disapproved of his coarse wit. According to William Munk, \\"Monsey maintained his original plainness of manners, and with an unreserved sincerity sometimes spoke truth in a manner that gave offence; and as old age approached, he acquired an asperity of behaviour and a neglect of decorum.... As a physician he adhered to the tenets of the Boerhaavian school, and despised modern improvements in theory and practice.\\" Monsey was a free-thinker in religious matters, or as Munk put it, \\"he shook off the manacles of superstition [and] he fell into the comfortless bigotry of scepticism.\\" One man whom Monsey admired was the Dutch-born physician, philosopher and satirist Bernard Mandeville.

It was based at Queenstown, now Cobh, in Ireland from 1797 - 1919. The admiral's headquarters was at Admiralty House, Cobh. History Admiralty House, Cobh, residence of the Commander-in-Chief, Coast of Ireland Station from 1886 to 1922 The French Revolutionary Wars led to Cobh, then usually known as Ballyvoloon or The Cove of Cork, being developed as a British naval port, and assigned an admiral. The first appointment of an \\"Admiral Commanding in Ireland\\" or \\"Commander-in-Chief, Cork\\" was in 1797. The post remained unfilled between 1831 and 1843. It was renamed \\"Commander-in-Chief, Queenstown\\" in 1849 following a visit by Queen Victoria during which she renamed the town of Cobh \\"Queenstown\\". The post became \\"Senior Officer on the Coast of Ireland\\" in 1876. The full title of the incumbent following the establishment of the post of Admiral Commanding, Coastguard and Reserves in 1903 was Senior Officer on the Coast of Ireland and Deputy to the Admiral Commanding Coastguard and Reserves for Coastguard Duty in Ireland. In July 1915, not without misgivings in some quarters, Vice- Admiral Lewis Bayly was appointed to the post. Bayly was tasked with keeping the approaches to Britain safe from U-boat attacks. In 1917, Bayly, promoted to admiral and given the title Commander-in-Chief, Coast of Ireland, was given command of a mixed British-American force defending the Western Approaches. He took as his chief-of-staff the American captain Joel R. P. Pringle. Bayly had a good working relation with his U.S. counterpart William Sims. He held this post until 1919. The post became \\"Commander in Chief, Western Approaches\\" in 1919, and was disestablished at the end of the Irish War of Independence in 1922. That year the town reverted back to the name Cobh. The Royal Navy continued to station ships in Ireland, in accordance with the Anglo-Irish Treaty until 1938. After Ireland’s independence, the Royal Navy presence generally consisted of two destroyers, with one usually anchored in the Cobh roadstead, opposite Haulbowline, and another either on roving patrol, or moored at Berehaven. These 'guard ships' were withdrawn and the harbour forts (probably including Fort Westmoreland, Fort Carlisle, and Fort Camden (Crosshaven) were handed over to the Irish Government in 1938.

The current lighthouse dates from 1927; it is owned and operated by PD Ports. It is claimed that its early-Victorian predecessor was the first lighthouse in the world reliably lit by gas.  History  Following the establishment of the Hartlepool Dock & Railway company, West Hartlepool quickly grew into a sizeable coal port on the Durham coast. In 1844, mariners tasked with navigating their way into the new docks had expressed concern about the inadequate provision of lights on this dangerous stretch of rocky coastline, and in 1846 the Corporation of Trinity House instructed the harbour authority to make necessary provision.  1847–1915: the first light on The Heugh  The old lighthouse on the Heugh. A lighthouse was promptly built in sandstone, at a cost of £3,200: a tapering cylindrical tower high. It was first lit on 1 October 1847, fuelled by natural gas from one of the local coal mines. The lens (a first-order fixed catadioptric optic) was the last to be manufactured by the pioneering Newcastle firm of Cookson & Co., following its takeover by Robert W. Swinburne. The main light was visible for 18 miles out to sea. A subsidiary (red) light was shown from a window lower down on the tower 'from half flood to half ebb' to signal the state of the tide (during the day a red spherical day mark was displayed in place of the red light). In December 1895 the characteristic of the main light was changed from fixed to occulting (going dark for one second every five seconds).London Gazette, Issue 26696, Page 16, 3 January 1896. The old light's demise came about as an indirect result of the German raid on Hartlepool in December 1914. The lighthouse itself was unscathed (though several nearby buildings received severe damage), but it was realised that the tower obstructed the line of fire of the defensive guns of the Headland batteries. It was therefore dismantled in 1915.  1915–1927: temporary light on the Town Moor  As a temporary measure, the light, lantern and lens from the Heugh Lighthouse were instead mounted on a wooden lattice structure on the nearby town moor. They remained here until the erection of the new Heugh light in 1927. When the structure was dismantled, the optic (lenses) and light array were saved; they are now on display in the Museum of Hartlepool.  1927 onwards: the current lighthouse  The current lighthouse, of a prefabricated steel construction, is a white- painted cylindrical tower, high. Built not far from the site of the first lighthouse (though without obstructing the line of fire of the guns) it was designed to be able to be dismantled in the event of war, so as not to provide a landmark for enemy gunsights. It was, from the start, electrically-powered and fully automated: the light was switched on and off at sunset and sunrise automatically, by a patent sun valve; mains electricity was used, but as a backup a petrol generator was provided which was automatically engaged in the event of a power failure; and in the event of the bulb failing an automatic lamp changer would bring a spare bulb into operation (this change being signalled by a warning light mounted on the shore side of the lighthouse). The light displayed two white flashes every ten seconds.  Present-day operation  The lighthouse in its compound The lighthouse is still in use today, under the management of the local port authority. It displays a white light, flashing twice every ten seconds. One of the adjacent buildings housed a nautophone fog signal, which used to sound three 3-second blasts every 45 seconds. The other building houses radio equipment for HM Coastguard.  Other nearby lighthouses  Nearby Seaton Carew had a pair of lighthouses for many years. They were decommissioned in the late nineteenth century; years later one of the two was re-erected in Hartlepool Marina as a mariners' memorial. South Gare Lighthouse stands on a pierhead at the opposite end of the bay to the Heugh, marking the southern approach to the River Tees. Just south-west of the Heugh, the Old or 'Pilots' Pier has been marked by a lighthouse since 1836. The present wooden structure (painted white with two narrow red horizontal stripes) dates from 1899; the lantern is strikingly topped by a rotating radar. It displays a green light (one flash every three seconds) with a white sector indicating the deep-water channel into the Old Harbour and Hartlepool Docks.

History Origin of 7 Division from existing and new Brigades 7 Division and 17, 18 and 19 Brigades were established on 1 April 1965. Difficulties with manning levels saw the disestablishment of 7 Division on 1 November 1967 and its replacement by the Army Task Force (HQ) and 16 Brigade. Re-designated Headquarters On 2 April 1971, a small band of officers (Brigadier Webster, Colonel Klaus Von Lieres, Colonel Hugh Hardingham, Major Barry York, Major Gerrie Moolman, Captain Bertie Suter, and Captain Manus Bothma) were summoned to meet with Major General Stapelberg (Combat General, Witwaterrand Command) to inaugurate the establishment of 7 Division, South African Army. The meeting took place at the headquarters of the Transvaal Irish Regiment in Johannesburg. From 1 September 1972 Army Task Force Headquarters was redesignated HQ 7 Division.Dorning, and Monick, 'The Forging of a Strike Force Part II,' Scientia Militaria, 22/3, 1992, p.32 fn 1. Sister Divisions Two years later, it was decided to organise the Army's conventional force into two divisions, 7th and 8th South African Armoured Divisions, under a Corps Headquarters. Both were primarily reserve (Citizen Force) formations, though the division and brigade HQs were Permanent Force. The headquarters of these two divisions were established on 1 August 1974. 1 South African Corps itself was established in August 1974 and was active until 30 January 1994. Commanding Officers 7 Division was commanded by: * Major General Neil Webster, original commanding officer of 7th Division.(1972–1983). * Brigadier General Heim Roos (1983–1987). * Brigadier General Gerrie Moolman (1987–1996), originally assigned to the Division in 1971, as a Major (TSO2), to assist with the establishment of the Division's headquarters.

To meet these requirements, the Army was subdivided into conventional and counterinsurgency forces. The Citizen Force, through the 7th and 8th Divisions, provided the Conventional Defence Force. In 1984 Northern Transvaal Command was subdivided and Far North Command (Pietersburg) formed. These two new Commands were regarded as theatres and as such also had responsibility for conventional operations (and units) within their areas. Far North Command had 73 Motorised Brigade within its area; it is not clear how much influence HQ 7 SA Division then had over that Brigade. Inter-divisional Reorganizing By 1985, 7 Division consisted of 71 Motorised Brigade, 73 Motorised Brigade and 82 Mechanised Brigade. 72 Motorised Brigade had been transferred to the command of 8th South African Armoured Division.

The test may be performed in people with suspected gluten-related disorders in very specific occasions and under medical supervision, for example in people who had started a gluten-free diet without performing duodenal biopsy. Gluten challenge is discouraged before the age of 5 years and during pubertal growth. Gluten challenge protocols have significant limitations because a symptomatic relapse generally precedes the onset of a serological and histological relapse, and therefore becomes unacceptable for most patients. History Before serological and biopsy-based diagnosis of coeliac disease was available, a gluten challenge test was a prerequisite for diagnosis of coeliac disease. Today, with serological testing (determination of coeliac disease-specific antibodies in the blood) and duodenal biopsy with histological testing being available for diagnosing coeliac disease, patients with suspected coeliac disease are strongly advised to undergo both serological and biopsy testing before undertaking a gluten-free diet. People who present minor damage of the small intestine often have negative blood antibodies titers and many patients with coeliac disease are missed when a duodenal biopsy is not performed. Serologic tests have a high capacity to detect coeliac disease only in patients with total villous atrophy and have very low capacity to detect cases with partial villous atrophy or minor intestinal lesions with normal villi. Currently, gluten challenge is no longer required to confirm the diagnosis in patients with intestinal lesions compatible with coeliac disease and a positive response to a gluten-free diet. Nevertheless, in some cases, a gluten challenge with a subsequent biopsy may be useful to support the diagnosis, for example in people with a high suspicion for coeliac disease, without a biopsy confirmation, who have negative blood antibodies and are already on a gluten- free diet. Gluten challenge is discouraged before the age of 5 years and during pubertal growth. European guidelines suggest that in children and adolescents with symptoms which are compatible with coeliac disease, the diagnosis can be made without the need for an intestinal biopsy if anti-tTG antibodies titres are very high (10 times the upper limit of normal). A recently proposed criteria to non-coeliac gluten sensitivity diagnosis concludes that an improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms and extra- intestinal manifestations higher than 50% with a gluten-free diet (GFD), assessed through a rating scale, may confirm the clinical diagnosis of non- coeliac gluten sensitivity. Nevertheless, this rating scale, is not yet applied worldwide. To exclude a placebo effect, a double-blind placebo- controlled gluten challenge is a useful tool, although it is expensive and complicated in routine clinical ground, and therefore, is only performed in research studies. Testing The test is also frequently used in clinical trials, for example for assessing the efficacy of novel drugs for patients with coeliac disease. Medical guidelines for performing a gluten challenge vary in terms of the recommended dose and duration of the test. Preparation In order to be able to assess the results of the gluten challenge, the patient needs to have been on a gluten-free diet beforehand, with symptoms having disappeared sufficiently for allowing for a subsequent re-appearance of symptoms under gluten challenge to be observed. Procedure It remains unclear what daily intake of gluten is adequate and how long the gluten challenge should last. Some protocols recommend eating a maximum of 10 g of gluten per day for 6 weeks. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that 2-week challenge of 3 g of gluten per day may induce histological and serological abnormalities in most adults with proven coeliac disease. This newly proposed protocol has shown higher tolerability and compliance, and it has been calculated that its application in secondary-care gastrointestinal practice would identify celiac disease in 7% patients referred for suspected non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, while in the remaining 93% would confirm non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, but is not yet universally adopted. A double-blind placebo-controlled gluten challenge can be performed by means of capsules containing gluten powder (or wheat powder) or a placebo, respectively,Lundin KEA, Alaedini A, Non-celiac Gluten Sensitivity. In: although it is expensive and complicated in routine clinical ground, and therefore, is only performed in research studies. There are indications that patients with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity show a reappearance of symptoms in far shorter time than is the case for coeliac disease: in non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, symptoms usually relapse in a few hours or days of gluten challenge. In cases of suspected coeliac disease, a gastrointestinal biopsy is performed at the end of the gluten challenge. For an alternative diagnosis of non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, the reappearance of symptoms is assessed. However, there is no agreement so far as to how to perform a non-coeliac gluten sensitivity symptom evaluation after a gluten challenge. For people eating a gluten-free diet who are unable to perform an oral gluten challenge, an alternative to identify a possible celiac disease is an in vitro gliadin challenge of small bowel biopsies, but this test is available only at selected specialized tertiary-care centers. Variations For determining whether certain foods such as oats can be tolerated by certain patients, a gradual challenge may be performed.

It sets out to describe the natural structure of the whole of the animal kingdom based on comparative anatomy, and its natural history. Cuvier divided the animals into four embranchements (\\"Branches\\", roughly corresponding to phyla), namely vertebrates, molluscs, articulated animals (arthropods and annelids), and zoophytes (cnidaria and other phyla). The work appeared in four octavo volumes in December 1816 (although it has \\"1817\\" on the title pages); a second edition in five volumes was brought out in 1829–1830 and a third, written by twelve \\"disciples\\" of Cuvier, in 1836–1849. In this classic work, Cuvier presented the results of his life's research into the structure of living and fossil animals. With the exception of the section on insects, in which he was assisted by his friend Pierre André Latreille, the whole of the work was his own. It was translated into English many times, often with substantial notes and supplementary material updating the book in accordance with the expansion of knowledge. It was also translated into German, Italian and other languages, and abridged in versions for children. Le Règne Animal was influential in being widely read, and in presenting accurate descriptions of groups of related animals, such as the living elephants and the extinct mammoths, providing convincing evidence for evolutionary change to readers including Charles Darwin, although Cuvier himself rejected the possibility of evolution. Context As a boy, Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) read the Comte de Buffon's Histoire Naturelle from the previous century, as well as Linnaeus and Fabricius. He was brought to Paris by Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1795, not long after the French Revolution. He soon became a professor of animal anatomy at the Musée National d'Histoire Naturelle, surviving changes of government from revolutionary to Napoleonic to monarchy. Essentially on his own he created the discipline of vertebrate palaeontology and the accompanying comparative method. He demonstrated that animals had become extinct. In an earlier attempt to improve the classification of animals, Cuvier transferred the concepts of Antoine- Laurent de Jussieu's (1748-1836) method of natural classification, which had been presented in 1789 in Genera plantarum, from botany to zoology. In 1795, from a \\"fixist\\" perspective (denying the possibility of evolution), Cuvier divided Linnaeus's two unsatisfactory classes (\\"insects\\" and \\"worms\\") into six classes of \\"white-blooded animals\\" or invertebrates: molluscs, crustaceans, insects and worms (differently understood), echinoderms and zoophytes.Cuvier, Georges. Mémoire sur une nouvelle distribution des animaux à sang blanc, lu le 21 Floréal de l'an III (10 mai 1795), à la Société d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris.

Still not satisfied, he continued to work on animal classification, culminating over twenty years later in the Règne Animal. Blackcock and pin-tailed sandgrouse. 1828 edition For the Règne Animal, using evidence from comparative anatomy and palaeontology—including his own observations—Cuvier divided the animal kingdom into four principal body plans. Taking the central nervous system as an animal's principal organ system which controlled all the other organ systems such as the circulatory and digestive systems, Cuvier distinguished four types of organisation of an animal's body:De Wit, Hendrik Cornelius Dirk. Histoire du Développement de la Biologie, Volume III, Presses Polytechniques et Universitaires Romandes, Lausanne, 1994, p. 94-96. * I. with a brain and a spinal cord (surrounded by parts of the skeleton) * II. with organs linked by nerve fibres * III. with two longitudinal, ventral nerve cords linked by a band with two ganglia positioned below the oesophagus * IV. with a diffuse nervous system which is not clearly discernible Grouping animals with these body plans resulted in four \\"embranchements\\" or branches (vertebrates, molluscs, the articulata that he claimed were natural (arguing that insects and annelid worms were related) and zoophytes (radiata)). This effectively broke with the mediaeval notion of the continuity of the living world in the form of the great chain of being. It also set him in opposition to both Saint- Hilaire and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. Lamarck claimed that species could transform through the influence of the environment, while Saint-Hilaire argued in 1820 that two of Cuvier's branches, the molluscs and radiata, could be united via various features, while the other two, articulata and vertebrates, similarly had parallels with each other. Then in 1830, Saint-Hilaire argued that these two groups could themselves be related, implying a single form of life from which all others could have evolved, and that Cuvier's four body plans were not fundamental.

The work was illustrated with tables and plates (at the end of Volume IV) covering only some of the species mentioned. A much larger set of illustrations, said by Cuvier to be \\"as accurate as they were elegant\\" was published by the entomologist Félix Édouard Guérin-Méneville in his Iconographie du Règne Animal de G.

The 448 quarto plates by Christophe Annedouche, Canu, Eugène Giraud, Lagesse, Lebrun, Vittore Pedretti, Plée and Smith illustrated some 6200 animals. Translations Le Règne Animal was translated into languages including English, German and Italian. Many English translations and abridged versions were published and reprinted in the nineteenth century; records may be for the entire work or individual volumes, which were not necessarily dated, while old translations were often brought out in \\"new\\" editions by other publishers, making for a complex publication history. A translation was made Edward Griffith (with assistance by Edward Pidgeon for some volumes and other specialists for other volumes) was published in 44 parts by G.B. Whittaker and partners from 1824–1835 and many times reprinted (up to 2012 and eBook format); another by G. Henderson in 1834–1837. A translation was made and published by the ornithologist William MacGillivray in Edinburgh in 1839–1840. Another version by Edward Blyth and others was published by William S. Orr and Co. in 1840. An abridged version by an \\"experienced teacher\\" was published by Longman, Brown, Green and Longman in London, and by Stephen Knapp in Coventry, in 1844. Kraus published an edition in New York in 1969. Other editions were brought out by H.G. Bohn in 1851 and W. Orr in 1854.

An Italian translation by G. de Cristofori was published by Stamperia Carmignani in 1832. A Hungarian translation by Peter Vajda was brought out in 1841. Approach Spiny dogfish. 1828 edition Each section, such as on reptiles at the start of Volume II (and the entire work) is introduced with an essay on distinguishing aspects of their zoology. In the case of the reptiles, the essay begins with the observation that their circulation is so arranged that only part of the blood pumped by the heart goes through the lungs; Cuvier discusses the implications of this arrangement, next observing that they have a relatively small brain compared to the mammals and birds, and that none of them incubate their eggs. Next, Cuvier identifies the taxonomic divisions of the group, in this case four orders of reptiles, the chelonians (tortoises and turtles), saurians (lizards), ophidians (snakes) and batracians (amphibians, now considered a separate class of vertebrates), describing each group in a single sentence. Thus the batracians are said to have a heart with a single atrium, a naked body (with no scales), and to pass with age from being fish-like to being like a quadruped or biped. There is then a section heading, in this case \\"The first order of Reptiles, or The Chelonians\\", followed by a three-page essay on their zoology, starting with the fact that their hearts have two atria. The structure then repeats at a lower taxonomic level, with what Cuvier notes is one of Linnaeus's genera, Testudo, the tortoises, with five sub- genera. The first sub-genus comprises the land tortoises; their zoology is summed up in a paragraph, which observes that they have a domed carapace, with a solid bony support (the term being \\"charpente\\", commonly used of the structure of wooden beams that support a roof). He records that the legs are thick, with short digits joined for most of their length, five toenails on the forelegs, four on the hind legs. Then (on the ninth page) he arrives at the first species in the volume, the Greek tortoise, Testudo graeca. It is summed up in a paragraph, Cuvier noting that it is the commonest tortoise in Europe, living in Greece, Italy, Sardinia and (he writes) apparently all round the Mediterranean. He then gives its distinguishing marks, with a highly domed carapace, raised scales boldly marked with black and yellow marbling, and at the posterior edge a bulge over the tail. He gives its size—rarely reaching a foot in length; notes that it lives on leaves, fruit, insects and worms; digs a hole in which to pass the winter; mates in spring, and lays 4 or 5 eggs like those of a pigeon. The species is illustrated with two plates.

Reception Contemporary Swainson's Quinarian classification of birds The entomologist William Sharp Macleay, in his 1821 book Horae Entomologicae which put forward the short-lived \\"Quinarian\\" system of classification into 5 groups, each of 5 subgroups, etc., asserted that in the Règne Animal \\"Cuvier was notoriously deficient in the power of legitimate and intuitive generalization in arranging the animal series\\". The zoologist William John Swainson, also a Quinarian, added that \\"no person of such transcendent talents and ingenuity, ever made so little use of his observations towards a natural arrangement as M. Cuvier.\\" The Magazine of Natural History of 1829 expressed surprise at the long interval between the first and second editions, surmising that there were too few scientific readers in France, apart from those in Paris itself; it notes that while the first volume was little changed, the treatment of fish was considerably altered in volume II, while the section on the Articulata was greatly enlarged (to two volumes, IV and V) and written by M. Latreille. It also expressed the hope that there would be an English equivalent of Cuvier's work, given the popularity of natural history resulting from the works of Thomas Bewick (A History of British Birds 1797–1804) and George Montagu (Ornithological Dictionary, 1802). The same review covers Félix Édouard Guérin-Méneville's Iconographie du Règne Animal de M. le Baron Cuvier, which offered illustrations of all Cuvier's genera (except for the birds). The Foreign Review of 1830 broadly admired Cuvier's work, but disagreed with his classification. It commented that \\"From the comprehensive nature of the Règne Animal, embracing equally the structure and history of all the existing and extinct races of animals, this work may be viewed as an epitome of M. Cuvier's zoological labours; and it presents the best outline, which exists in any language, of the present state of zoology and comparative anatomy.\\" The review continued less favourably, however, that \\"We cannot help thinking that the science of comparative anatomy is now so far advanced, as to afford the means of distributing the animal kingdom on some more uniform and philosophical principles,—as on the modifications of those systems or functions which are most general in the animal economy\\". The review argued that the vertebrate division relied on the presence of a vertebral column, \\"a part of the organization of comparatively little importance in the economy\\"; it found the basis of the mollusca on \\"the general softness of the body\\" no better; the choice of the presence of articulations no better either, in the third division; while in the fourth it points out that while the echinoderms may fit well into the chosen scheme, it did not apply \\"to the entozoa, zoophyta, and infusoria, which constitute by much the greatest portion of this division.\\" But the review notes that \\"the general distribution of the animal kingdom established by M. Cuvier in this work, are founded on a more extensive and minute survey of the organization than had ever before been taken, and many of the most important distinctions among the orders and families are the result of his own researches.\\" Writing in the Monthly Review of 1834, the pre- Darwinian evolutionist surgeon Sir William Lawrence commented that \\"the Regne Animal of Cuvier is, in short, an abridged expression of the entire science. He carried the lights derived from his zoological researches into kindred but obscure parts of nature.\\" Lawrence calls the work \\"an arrangement of the animal kingdom nearly approaching to perfection; grounded on principles so accurate, that the place which any animal occupies in this scheme, already indicates the leading circumstances in its structure, economy, and habits.\\" The book was in the library of HMS Beagle for Charles Darwin's voyage. In The Origin of Species (1859), in a chapter on the difficulties facing the theory, Darwin comments that \\"The expression of conditions of existence, so often insisted on by the illustrious Cuvier, is fully embraced by the principle of natural selection.\\" Darwin continues, reflecting both on Cuvier's emphasis on the conditions of existence, and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's theory of acquiring heritable characteristics from those Cuvieran conditions: \\"For natural selection acts by either now adapting the varying parts of each being to its organic and inorganic conditions of life; or by having adapted them during long-past periods of time: the adaptations being aided in some cases by use and disuse, being slightly affected by the direct action of the external conditions of life, and being in all cases subjected to the several laws of growth. Hence, in fact, the law of the Conditions of Existence is the higher law; as it includes, through the inheritance of former adaptations, that of Unity of Type.\\" Modern The palaeontologist Philippe Taquet wrote that \\"the Règne Animal was an attempt to create a complete inventory of the animal kingdom and to formulate a natural classification underpinned by the principles of the 'correlation of parts'..\\" He adds that with the book \\"Cuvier introduced clarity into natural history, accurately reproducing the actual ordering of animals.\\" Taquet further notes that while Cuvier rejected evolution, it was paradoxically \\"the precision of his anatomical descriptions and the importance of his research on fossil bones\\", showing for instance that mammoths were extinct elephants, that enabled later naturalists including Darwin to argue convincingly that animals had evolved.

The premiership was won by the Sandringham Football Club, after defeating North Ballarat by 31 points in the Grand Final on 27 August. The league underwent significant changes for the 2000 season, being merged with the Australian Football League reserves competition. Since this season, the VFL has served as a state-level senior competition in which reserves players and some reserves teams from the Victorian AFL clubs compete. Merger with the AFL reserves The Victorian State Football League had operated two open-age senior competitions during the 1990s: the Victorian Football League, which it took control of in 1995, and the AFL Reserves, which it had operated since 1992. The AFL Reserves competition was contested by the reserves teams of eleven Australian Football League clubs: those of the ten Victorian clubs and that of the Sydney Swans. The VSFL had intended to merge the two into a single competition which would serve as an AFL reserves competition, a state-level senior competition and a development pathway from the 1995 season; however there was such significant opposition from the AFL clubs against abolishing their dedicated reserves competition that they had threatened to use their power to sack the AFL Commission over the changes. Consequently, the two competitions had run in parallel between 1995 and 1999. Prior to the 1998 season, the AFL again announced plans to amalgamate the VFL and the AFL reserves into a single competition, giving the clubs two years to make arrangements before the combined competition was to begin from the 2000 season. Although most of the AFL clubs were still opposed to the changes, on this occasion they accepted them. Under the new arrangement, AFL clubs were given two options: they could continue to operate their own reserves teams, fielding them in the VFL; or, they could enter a reserves affiliation with one or more existing VFL clubs. Under the affiliation structure, listed players who were not selected in the senior AFL team would be made available to play for their affiliated VFL club; the VFL club would then make up the balance of the team from its own playing list. Affiliations and league membership changes Under the new arrangement, four AFL clubs entered into affiliations with existing VFL clubs. These were:Fiddian, Marc (2004); The VFA; A History of the Victorian Football Association 1877-1995; p. 188 * affiliated with fellow eastern suburban club Box Hill. Box Hill immediately co-branded with Hawthorn, changing its nickname from the Mustangs to the Hawks. * affiliated with fellow western suburban clubs Werribee and Williamstown, with half of its players allocated to each VFL club. * affiliated with Sandringham. * entered a partial affiliation with Port Melbourne, the club with which it had shared a zone when it was based in South Melbourne. No more than six of Sydney's reserves players played for Port Melbourne; the rest played for a dedicated Sydney reserves team in the Sydney AFL competition. A fifth affiliation was established with the creation of a new club, the Murray Kangaroos. The Murray Kangaroos was operated in partnership between the North Melbourne Football Club and the Ovens & Murray Football League, and was based at both Coburg City Oval in Melbourne and the Lavington Sports Ground in Albury. The Murray Kangaroos were affiliated with the Murray Bushrangers from the TAC Cup under-18s competition, which served to complete the VSFL's original vision that all twelve Victorian TAC Cup clubs would be affiliated with a VFL club. This left six Victorian AFL clubs, all of which entered their reserves teams directly into the VFL. These were: Carlton, Collingwood, Essendon, Geelong, Richmond and St Kilda. Other changes After four years, the merger between Preston Bullants senior club and the Northern Knights TAC Cup club was terminated, and the two clubs returned to being separate entities. The senior club, which had competed as the Preston Knights since 1996, became known as the Northern Bullants, and it returned to the red and white colours that it had worn prior to 1996. With the increased size of the league, the finals were expanded from five clubs to eight clubs. The VFL adopted the same final eight system which was adopted by the AFL in the same season, replacing the McIntyre Final Five which had been in use since 1989. The Victorian State Football League was superseded by a newly established body, Football Victoria, which administered the league. Summary As a result of this large suite of changes, the size of the VFL grew from eleven to eighteen clubs, the largest it had been since 1987. The size of the competition during the 2000 season was the largest ever to contest the premiership in a single division in VFA/VFL history. The clubs were: Stand alone VFL *Bendigo *Coburg-Fitzroy *Frankston *North Ballarat *Northern Bullants *Springvale AFL reserves teams *Carlton *Collingwood *Essendon *Geelong *Richmond *St Kilda AFL reserves affiliated *Box Hill () *Murray Kangaroos () *Port Melbourne () *Sandringham () *Werribee () *Williamstown () Premiership season Ladder Finals Series Grand Final Awards *The Jim 'Frosty' Miller Medal was won for the second consecutive year by Nick Sautner (Sandringham), who kicked 60 goals. *The J. J. Liston Trophy was won by David Robbins (Springvale), who polled 23 votes. *The Fothergill-Round Medal was won by Michael Swan (Port Melbourne). *Sandringham won the reserves premiership. Sandringham 17.15 (117) defeated Port Melbourne 11.7 (73) in the Grand Final, held as a curtain-raiser to the Seniors Grand Final on 27 August. Notable events *The VFL established a second television deal during the 2000 season, with one match played each Monday night and broadcast live on the Seven Network's subscription television channel C7 Sport, in addition to the long-standing weekly Saturday afternoon broadcasts on ABC Victoria. The Monday night fixture was short-lived, and did not survive beyond the 2000 season. *With the disuse of Waverley Park for Australian Football League games following the opening of Docklands Stadium, Waverley Park became available for VFA/VFL football for the first and only time in its history. Springvale, located only a few kilometres away, played all but its first home game of the season at the ground, and all Monday night games were played at the ground, as well as a few other isolated games and the Grand Final. The Grand Final was the last game of competitive football played on Waverley Park before it was sold to developers. *Bendigo's six point win against Murray in Round 17 was its final ever win as a stand-alone VFL club. Its remaining 78 games as a stand-alone club (spanning seasons 2000–2002 and 2013–2014 and excluding the period of its reserves affiliation with ) yielded one draw and 77 losses. *As with other major football leagues, the 2000 season was played a month earlier than usual, to ensure it was finished before the 2000 Sydney Olympics, which began on 15 September.

They look pleased, but it is unclear what he might be planning. Whatever this is, everything changes when Lawry goes home and finds out his wife is pregnant. He does not go to meet Dona's parents. They wait for hours. She forgives him this and the affair resumes. But when the other musicians sing a celebration song to Lawry she discovers he is to be a father and she is furious and heart-broken. Lawry imagines breaking down a door and finding Dona dead from hanging herself. We see him dress sombrely with a black tie, but instead of going to Dona's funeral he goes to his own baby's naming ceremony. Instead of committing suicide Dona later sings a song about being betrayed and being 'in heaven', whilst crying on stage... It is now 1967 or later. Dona signs a musician's contract to record a duet with Mohammed Rafi. She says, 'I won't sing with anyone.' But she does sing with Rafi and Lawry stands next to them playing trumpet. Dona listens to the advice of the local drunk who thinks she will soon join his 'world of madness' as she is so sad. He offers her alcohol to help with her sorrow. After another gig, Lawry says Dona behaves like a tart with the audience. She says he has treated her that way and she will no longer sing with him. Next day, Logic, the band manager, cannot find Dona for rehearsal. They use a new singer, Usha, for a recording. Logic doesn't think this recording has any magic to it. The band needs Dona. We see Dona singing with another band and looking somewhat unravelled or drunk. Lawry arrives in the audience. He gets on stage, grabs a mic stand and chases Dona off, shouting about her trying to challenge him. We hear a strike and a shriek. Backstage Dona sobs. Lawry calms down, then leaves. By 1970 both have success separately with their bands in Bombay. Dona's father dies. Lawry has another child. In Goa in 1974 Dona hides a bottle of spirits under a shawl and appears rough. Lawry's wife is pregnant again. In 1975 Lawry contemplates how the film industry credited the actors rather than the musicians and composers from Goa on many well-known films. In 1995 we see a man track down Dona and encourage her to return to the stage. The film ends with footage of the real Lorna Cordeiro singing. 2004 shows a tombstone for Lawry. There is a voiceover in English concerning the decline of Goan musicianship over the decades. note: The film weaves its lilting narrative through 20 timeless songs based on actual events. Songs are frequently accompanied by flamenco dancers who embody the emotional turmoil of the story-telling. This quasi-biographical film is a tribute to one of Goa’s greatest, yet barely acknowledged legacy - its musicians, who once upon a time set the jazz clubs of Bombay on fire and actually shaped the music of Bollywood cinema. Nachom-ia Kumpasar is a nostalgic musical tale set in the times these musicians lived and died in - unrecognized, unappreciated… and unsung until now.

Attestations There are several artifacts, as well as Greek sources, supporting the existence of an Egyptian ruler with this name during the Persian period. The archaeological findings bearing this name consists in a sistrum handle, which also give a throne name Amasis (Ahmose), a scarab with the throne name Nb-k3-n-Rˁ, an ushabti, and a Demotic document from Diospolis Parva (papyrus Straßburg 2), dating to a regnal year 2, while Greek authors give several times the name of this ruler.Anthony Spalinger, Psammetichus IV; Psammetichus V; Psammetichus VI in Lexikon der Ägyptologie 4 (1982), pp. 1173–75. However, the difference of both dating and naming of these attestations makes their attributions to an individual ruler virtually impossible. Identification In 1980, the American Egyptologist Eugene Cruz-Uribe first proposedEugène Cruz-Uribe, \\"On the Existence of Psammetichus IV\\". Serapis. American Journal of Egyptology 5 (1980), pp. 35–39. that the aforementioned papyrus Straßburg 2 from Diospolis Parva, traditionally attributed to Psammetichus III, is in fact more recent and refers to a ruler with the same name who he called “Psammetichus IV”. According to Cruz-Uribe, this ruler most likely reigned over part of Egypt around the 480s BCE: within this decade it is known through Herodotus that a revolt occurred in Egypt in conjunction with the last years of Darius I and the rise of Xerxes I, who, once crowned, promptly suppressed the rebels.Leo Depuydt, Saite and Persian Egypt, 664 BC - 332 BC, in Erik Hornung, Rolf Krauss and David A. Warburton (eds.), Ancient Egyptian Chronology (= Handbook of Oriental studies. Section One. The Near and Middle East, Vol. 83). Brill, Leiden/Boston, 2006, , p. 282 Anthony Spalinger believed that Cruz-Uribe's attribution was “too tentative”, and agreed that Psammetichus IV was the same person as Inaros II's father, mentioned by Herodotus as a Libyan. According to Greek sources, Inaros was a “king of the Libyans” who led a large, well-known revolt against the Persians in the 460s BCE. Assuming that this identification is correct, it appears that this Psammetichus did not have enough authority to claim the Egyptian throne. For this reason, Spalinger believes that the aforementioned archaeological findings may rather belong to a subsequent ruler with the same name: the Athenian historian Philochorus reports that a Psammetichus (V) – who probably was a great-grandson of Psammetichus IV for likely being the son of Thannyros, himself son of Inaros II – shipped grains to Athens in 445/4 BCE. Finally, Diodorus Siculus mentions a Psammetichus (VI) as a king of Egypt in 400 BCE, saying that he was a “descendant of the famous Psammetichus”.

He was president of the Mexican League and owned interests in several teams at a time when the league recruited from Negro league baseball and Major League Baseball, creating a big threat to the Major League talent level. Jorge Pasquel brought racial integration to professional baseball and had a big role when Jackie Robinson debuted in 1947 with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Mr Pasquel died in a plane crash in 1955. He was inducted into the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971. Biography Early life Pasquel was born in Veracruz, Mexico. When he was a child, U.S. military forces had invaded Veracruz. He and four of his brothers ran a cigar factory and then created additional wealth working in various business ventures. By the mid-1940s, the estimated wealth of the family was in the tens of millions of dollars. Baseball career Pasquel and his brothers owned the Azules de Veracruz of the Mexican League and were minority owners in several other clubs. Pasquel was named Mexican League president in 1946. As early as 1943, Pasquel had begun bringing players over from Negro league baseball (who were barred from MLB). After recruiting successfully from the Negro leagues, Pasquel began to offer high salaries to bring major league talent over to the Mexican League. He may have been driven by nationalism and by a dislike for American imperialism, possibly spurred by the U.S. invasion of his hometown when he was a child. After signing a number of major league players with impressive salaries, Pasquel found that he could not attract high enough attendance in Mexico to offset the salaries. Overall, 18 major league players jumped to the Mexican League. In 1946, American player Mickey Owen returned to the United States after playing briefly in the Mexican League. He cited poor playing conditions. A long legal battle ensued, after which Owen was determined to owe Pasquel $35,000 for breach of contract. The league took large financial losses in 1947. Baseball commissioner Happy Chandler imposed a lifetime major league ban for players who went to the Mexican League, which was finally lifted after 5 years, when a federal appeals court allowed a former major league player's lawsuit to proceed. Pasquel and his brother Bernardo left the Mexican League in 1952. The brothers had owned the teams in Veracruz and Mexico City as well as the league's large , now the Parque Delta mall. The players from those two teams were divided among the other six clubs in the league. The Mexican government purchased Parque Delta from Pasquel so that the league could continue using it. Pasquel made headlines the next year when he gained distribution rights for the nation's oil from his cousin, Mexican president Miguel Alemán Valdés. Death and legacy Pasquel was killed in a 1955 plane crash. Shortly after Pasquel's death, the Mexican League became a part of American professional baseball. Pasquel was inducted into the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971.

His family has been working in the trade of traditional Alizarin Bagh print since 7th century. As he began early in life, most part of his life is experienced for Bagh hand block printing. Notable work Earlier Mohammed Yusuf Khatri and his family used to prefabricate different traditional dresses for the persons belonging to different castes living in tribal area of Bagh block of Dhar district of Madhya Pradesh. Because the people of different castes and families had different dresses like Maroo, Jat, Meghwal, Mahajan, Bhil, Bhilala society and they were identified with their dresses. After 1990 Mohammed Yusuf Khatri did new experiments on the clothes for urban market. He did block printing with hand and designed cultural clothing firstly. He also experimented incorporating modernity in the wooden blocks and colours in such a way that its fame and popularity could be established for a long time on the national and international level. He proved his imagination true by making craft on bamboo mat, leather, jute etc. besides cloth, Bagh Print was engraved with natural colours on bamboo chick. This was the first experiment of the world which was completed with colours on bamboo mat. It is notable that before or after popularity of Bagh print in the world, no example of such kind is recorded. Hence it is the first sample of such art in the world. Bagh print tableau on republic day parade The tableau of Bagh prints was displayed in republic day celebration parade 2011 from rajpath to red fort.

In this tableau Mohammed Yusuf Khatri exhibited the live demo of Bagh prints craft. on republic day celebration, the craft of Bagh prints was introduced to the former honourable president of india Pratibha Devisingh Patil & Honourable vice president Dr. Hamid Ansari & the then honourable prime minister Dr. Manmohan Singh took the information of excellencies of Bagh prints and admired the craft person a lot.

It specialises in direct management of current health services and radical strategic thinking in complex health economies. Many of the partners are former Chief Executives of NHS trusts. They are frequently employed by boards in the English NHS either to supply interim management or to advise on strategic difficulties. The firm were involved in the development of the new Royal Adelaide Hospital. They managed the building of the new Treatment Centre in Kidderminster for Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust. Black says \\"When I was a Whitehall official under Thatcher and Clarke I dedicated years to destroying NHS Estates and failed\\". Harrison was formerly Chief Executive of Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust which she left the day before the Healthcare Commission reported on problems at the Trust. The inspectors later wrote: \\"(We) consider there were significant failings on the part of the leadership at the trust and have recommended that the leadership change.\\" Durrow was later employed by Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust, whose chief executive, Samatha Jones, is related to her by marriage. The Trust said in response to criticism: \\"Following a competitive tendering process, specialist health management consultancy Durrow has been hired to manage a review of women's and children's services at Epsom and St Helier Hospitals.\\" Durrow provided Dorset County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust with a temporary chief executive in 2009/10, Derek Smith, at a cost of more than £2,500 a day, plus almost £20,000 in expenses. Though the cost of interim executives was criticised the Trust credited them with turning round their financial situation. The trust predicted a break even in 2011/2012, whereas a £17m deficit had been predicted. Black has an interest in small rural hospitals. He told the BBC in September 2014: \\"If you pursue the centralisation of acute care you end up with a significant proportion of the smaller rural and semi rural hospitals which are deemed non-viable. But the citizens and the voters don't see it that way. So the political pathway to closing that hospital is closed, and the NHS pathway to making it successful is closed.\\" Wycombe MP Steve Baker commissioned a report from the consultancy in 2014 about the future of Wycombe Hospital at a cost of £8000 from his parliamentary allowance. Their report suggested that the hospital could be used for a \\"new generation\\" of casualty unit with an ambulance station integrated into the hospital and could offer GP appointments. Baker was attacked by Linda Derrick, Wycombe Labour's spokesperson on health who said he \\"should have checked the reputations and credibility of the people who he was paying to provide him with advice on the future of Wycombe hospital.\\" In response Durrow retorted: \\"The only thing I would say is millions of pounds have been spent by Labour on management consultants, so they are not adverse to that.\\" References External links * Company website Category:Private providers of NHS services ","title":"Durrow healthcare consultancy"},{"id":"44855477","text":"Punjab Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS Jalandhar) is a medical college and medical research institute based in Jalandhar, India.

In India, Rambo served as the medical director of the Christian Hospital Mungeli and initiated the development of eye camps, groups of medical surgeons that visited towns, set up cataract removal stations, and restored sight to the partially blind through eye surgeries. Under Rambo's leadership, the hospital conducted over 150 eye camps in over 25 villages. It is estimated that the implementation of these eye camps helped restore sight to over 40,000 patients.  Early life   Childhood  Victor Clough Rambo was born in Landour, India in 1894 to parents William Eagle Rambo and Kate Rambo, both missionaries working for the Foreign Christian Missionary Society at the time. In January 1895, when Victor was six months old, the family moved to Damoh, the location of the boys’ orphanage where William taught. The area suffered from monsoon floods, starvation, and disease and over the next five years, the population of the district decreased by about 40,000 people. As more families went hungry, government-sponsored trains sent hundreds of orphans from the north of the country to the Damoh orphanage, where William started farms on which many of the orphans worked and were provided clothing and food. From his father's work, he was exposed to the consequences of starvation, cholera and illness, even noting, \\"I had such a boyhood... no one else could dream of.\\" Raised in a strict Christian family, Rambo was taught to value the Bible and the teachings of Christianity. While living with the other families on the mission compound, he learned conversational Hindi from the native workers.  Return to the United States  In the spring of 1904, the family moved back to the United States, after William and Kate fell ill. The family spent the summer of that year in New Hampshire on a farm with Kate's sister before they relocated to Des Moines, Iowa. In 1908, the family moved to Farson, Wyoming where they settled for the next five years, living in a small three-room house. During the five years in Farson, Rambo and the family planted crops and raised chickens for food, often struggling to produce enough for all members of the household. When Rambo was sixteen, he began working as a water boy to earn money for the family. He soon got a more permanent job driving a Fresno scraper, a metal basket that dumped dirt into an irrigation ditch, but was subsequently fired after he joined a group of workers protesting the wage. He then worked as an orderly in the local hospital and caught the attention of the resident doctor, who began to teach him common procedures such as catheterization. After the doctor left the hospital, Rambo performed many of the former doctor's duties, assisting in the operating room and helping out with emergencies at midnight. He learned to recognize and use different surgical knives and other tools and started handling the catheterization of paraplegics. He attended a nursing class and was two months short of graduating with a registered nurse's certificate when the family suddenly moved to Idaho after William was asked to preach in Emmett. In March 1914, the family moved again to Chehalis, Washington, where Rambo remained until September 1915, graduating from high school at the age of twenty-one.  Education  Rambo attended Fairmount College, now Wichita State University, in Wichita, Kansas and graduated in 1917. He was admitted to the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, now Perelman School of Medicine, and received his medical degree in 1921 at the age of twenty-seven. In order to pay for medical school, Rambo worked as a janitor, busboy, and furnace-keeper. He soon received a scholarship for medical school from members of the Penn Christian Association, who formed a group that would eventually be known as the Rambo Committee, an organization that supported Rambo throughout his time in India and beyond. While completing his hospital residency at Pennsylvania Hospital, Rambo was chosen by the head of experimental surgery to stay in the department after residency, but he declined the offer and expressed his desire to become a medical missionary instead. At end of June 1923, Rambo finished his two years of residency and applied to be an overseas medical missionary, despite having been offered the position of Dean of Meharry Medical College in Nashville at the time of his graduation. Four days after applying, he was assigned to do work in India by the United Christian Missionary Society. In June, Rambo was ordained as a minister in the Church of Christ and in August, he was made a diplomate of the National Board of Medical Examiners.  Missionary Journey  Victor Rambo married Louise Birch on October 8, 1923, in Germantown, Pennsylvania. The couple left for India from Seattle and arrived in Calcutta on January 12, 1924. They stayed in Calcutta for a few days and then headed to Harda, a town where they studied Hindi for about three months with a teacher. Knowledge of Hindi was a requisite for missionary work in India, so in March, the Rambos moved to Landour to study the language further. There, Rambo worked in a small mission hospital, assisting in surgery. In September, the Rambos returned to Harda to take their required first-year language oral exams, which they both passed. In December, they left for Mungeli, a small town in central India with a population of about 5,000 people, that served as a central hub for the 250,000 people in the 250 surrounding villages. The Mungeli mission station was located on one side of the Agar River and the town on the other, and soon, Rambo started work at the local hospital.  Medical missionary work   Work with Christian Hospital Mungeli  Rambo became the medical director of the Christian Hospital Mungeli in 1925. He worked at the hospital with Hira Lal, an Indian man who had learned to deliver children, hold clinics, and treat malaria and other diseases from former missionaries, despite having no medical degree of his own. When Rambo arrived, he faced many challenges. The hospital building only had four rooms, one for storage, two for examining patients, and one for operating. There was no plumbing or proper medical equipment, which made it challenging for him to perform surgery. He encountered a variety of surgical cases, ranging from childbirth emergencies to infections resulting from accidents. The most prevalent diseases during Rambo's early years in Mungeli were yaws and syphilis. Rambo sent workers into villages to gather all people with symptoms of these or other significant diseases and give them injections for their ailments. In one year alone, Rambo, Hira Lal and other workers treated nearly 17,000 patients in outlying dispensaries and performed over 737 operations. During his time in India, Rambo gained many supporters, and the hospital's facilities and delivery of medical services expanded substantially, as the building grew from a four-room hospital into a 120-bed surgical unit known for treating eye disease. The hospital was remodeled to include an outpatient department, lab, and records room and several new wards after it accepted a substantial donation from a supporter back in the United States. Rambo received new operating, delivery, and examining rooms for eye patients. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi provided Rambo with equipment and instruments worth over 10,000 dollars, and Oxfam donated additional supplies.  Focus on eye care  Over time, Rambo noticed that blindness was a major problem in the region. Rambo was aware that for many years, people in the region had relied on \\"couchers,\\" men who traveled with broken razor blades and performed relatively painless eye surgeries on partially blind patients. They would make an incision in the cornea and push the hardened lens back into the vitreous, restoring sight for the patient. However, 97% of patients lost use of the eye within months after surgery, and although couching was outlawed by the government, many people still consulted couchers for surgery. Rambo started performing cataract operations after successfully removing two cataracts from a patient's eye. He was initially hesitant to perform more surgeries, having had limited experience in ophthalmology, but began to treat more patients after a large number of blind individuals approached him for operations. Under Rambo's leadership, the hospital became well known for its work in restoring sight through the use of \\"eye camps,\\" surgical teams from the hospital that traveled to villages and performed eye surgeries, often cataract removal surgeries. Rambo thought of the idea of an \\"eye camp\\" after speaking with a patient who suggested that he come to the villages to perform operations, because he knew many individuals who had lost their vision and could not make the journey out to the distant mission hospital. He was originally hesitant to pursue the idea, knowing the potential risks of operating in a non-sterilized environment. After consulting with Hira Lal, who suggested Rambo test the concept, he decided to go to a village about nineteen miles from Mungeli. When he arrived at the village, there were about fifty people waiting for him to begin operating. He operated on their eyes using a teacher's desk as a table and was able to remove nineteen cataracts that day successfully. As Rambo traveled to villages and performed more operations, he discovered that cataracts accounted for about 55% of all cases of blindness in the country. Determined to mitigate the blindness problem in India, Rambo held the first official eye camp in March 1943 in Kawardha, an area forty-five miles away from Mungeli. There was an adequately equipped hospital in the area with about eight clean beds, and Rambo was able to perform ninety-five successful operations that day, most of them for cataract removal. Camps were held during the winter months in churches, schoolhouses, temples, and other large buildings, and the doctors used slit-lamp microscopes and instruments kept in boxes to prevent contamination. They followed the same procedure as in an official hospital: they sterilized instruments by boiling them and then using a pressure cooker. Over the next twenty five years, the hospital held more than 150 eye camps in over 25 villages and restored the sight of many.  Teaching  In 1947, Rambo began teaching part-time in the Ophthalmology Department at the Christian Medical College, located in Vellore. Over the course of the next ten years, he spent half of each year teaching and the other six months working in Mungeli. Rambo taught both undergraduate and graduate medical and nursing classes and encouraged students to watch and participate in his surgeries. From 1947 to 1958, he served as chief of the Eye Department at Christian Medical College and was named chief of the Eye Department of Christian Medical College, Ludhiana in 1959.  Role of the Rambo Committee  Throughout the fifty years of Rambo's career, the Rambo Committee sent medical supplies, equipment, literature, and funds to support the education of dozens of Indian physicians and Dr. Rambo's work. In the 1930s, the committee purchased hospital beds and surgical supplies for the hospital. In the 1970s, the committee adopted the name, \\"Rambo Committee, Inc.,\\" and had an annual budget of approximately $50,000, which was used to support the work in India as well as the work of Dr. Rambo's son, Dr. Birch Rambo, a medical missionary in Zaire. The committee provided the funds to open the Good Samaritan Hospital in Nigeria in 1970. After Dr. Rambo and his wife left India, the Rambo Committee provided financial support to keep the Christian Hospital Mungeli open from 1980 to 2003, when it experienced a lack of incoming funds.  Later life and death  In 1957, Rambo was elected president of the All-India Ophthalmological Society. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he still performed surgeries, but left many of his operations to other doctors. He spent time in Ludhiana, India in the fall and winter attending various conferences, seminars, and speaking engagements. During this period, the eye camps that Dr. Rambo helped established treated more than five thousand patients. The teams at Vellore, Sompeta, Mungeli, and Ludhiana completed more than fourteen thousand eye operations, despite India's increased fighting with Pakistan in 1969. Rambo wanted to bring eye camps even farther than India, stating, \\"I want to have our science of sight restoration reach every single person with curable blindness in every needy nation.\\" In 1969, Rambo and Arin Chatterjee, a fellow physician, wrote a guide on mobile eye hospitals called The Curable Blind: A Guide for Establishing and Maintaining Mobile Eye Hospitals, a detailed book on the history, techniques, personnel, equipment, surgical procedures and care of patients in mobile eye hospitals. The Rambos returned to the United States in 1974, settling in Germantown, Pennsylvania, after more than half a century of service in India. They returned to India in 1976 to attend the fiftieth anniversary of the Christian Medical Association of India. In the United States, Rambo continued to work with the Rambo Committee to raise funds for projects in Mungeli. On May 23, 1987, Rambo died at the age of 92 in California, Kentucky. He was survived by his wife, five children, fifteen grandchildren, and two great- grandchildren.  Legacy  Rambo received many awards for his work, including the Gold Kaisar-i-Hind Medal from King George VI in 1941 for exceptional public service. In 1969, Rambo received the Ehrenzeller Award given by the ex- Residents Association of the Pennsylvania Hospital for distinguished service. In 1994, the Church of North India opened the Rambo School, named in honor of Dr. Rambo and his legacy, in a bungalow near the Christian Hospital Mungeli. The school, now reconstructed and referred to as the Rambo Memorial English Medium School, provides low-cost English education to children of hospital staff. In 2012, the school enrolled over 600 children aged seven through fifteen. Due to his work in India, Rambo was posthumously inducted into the Medical Mission Hall of Fame in 2008.

He has been a Member of the Bundestag (MdB) since September 2017. Gauland was the party's co-founder and was its federal spokesman from 2017 to 2019 and the party leader for the state of Brandenburg from 2013 to 2017. Biography Gauland was born in 1941 in Chemnitz, a city that became part of East Germany in 1949 and was renamed Karl-Marx-Stadt. After graduating from high school in 1959, he fled as a refugee to West Germany. He studied political science and law at Marburg, where he also received his doctorate. In 1972, Gauland entered the Federal Press Office and worked as the Director of the Office of the Mayor of Frankfurt am Main for 10 years. Afterwards, he became the head of a department of the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety in Bonn and Member of the Hessian Prime Minister´s cabinet. From 1991–2006, he worked as an editor of the local newspaper Märkische Allgemeine in Potsdam. Founding the AfD On the morning of 25 March 2010, German Chancellor Angela Merkel publicly promised there would be no direct financial aid to Greece, but reversed that statement hours later by agreeing with the leaders of the Euro countries to send the first of many \\"rescue packages\\" to Greece. Gerd Robanus, Assessor in the Federal Executive of the CDU-Business Association cited this as the reason for founding the \\"Election Alternative 2013\\" together with Alexander Gauland, Konrad Adam and Bernd Lucke. In February 2014, Gauland received about 80 percent of the vote during an Extraordinary National Congress in Diedersdorf, becoming chairman of the Brandenburg County Association of the right-wing Alternative for Germany. Landtag of Brandenburg The AfD got 12.2 percent of the vote in the 2014 Brandenburg state election, enabling it to enter the assembly of that state for the first time. On Tuesday, 10 July 2014 Gauland opened the inaugural session of the Landtag of Brandenburg: As part of this speech, after quoting Edmund Burke, Gauland wished the other members of parliament \\"all the strength and the courage, to tackle the tasks now ahead of them, in the interest of the voters and in the interest of the common good\\". Political affiliation and ideals Before becoming an AfD founding member Gauland was a member of the CDU. In 2012 Gauland became involved in the Berliner Kreis (\\"Berlin circle\\"), a loose association of federal and state politicians within the CDU, which has been trying for years to make the CDU conservative again, because they consider that under Angela Merkel's leadership it has moved away from these ideals. Alexander Gauland said he can not detect any right-wing extremists or radicals at the PEGIDA-Demonstrations. Gauland said: \\"I do not see right-wing extremists. I see citizens who demonstrate out of concern about developments in Germany, who are afraid. But I haven't seen any right-wing extremists, and we are not the allies of the right-wing extremists, but we are the allies of the people who have these concerns.\\"  Controversies  In May 2016, Gauland reportedly made comments about Bayern Munich and German national team footballer Jérôme Boateng in a conversation with Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung (FAS, Sunday edition of Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper). FAS cited Gauland, \\"people like him [Boateng] as a footballer, but they don't want to have a Boateng as a neighbour\\". A controversy arose about this sentence. Gauland defended himself, saying he was fooled by the newspaper and it had been a background discussion, which was classified as confidential and thus not intended for publication. The newspaper refuted this. Gauland added that the effect of the statement – which in his words was meant descriptive – was distorted by the headline of the newspaper, \\"Gauland insults Boateng\\" (\\"Gauland beleidigt Boateng\\"). The newspaper had no audio recording of the statement, but independently written memos of two journalists. While Boateng himself said he was \\"saddened\\" by the statement of Gauland, the German federal government said it was \\"a vile and sad sentence\\" (\\"ein niederträchtiger und ein trauriger Satz\\").Gauland rechtfertigt sich für Boateng-Äußerungen, Die Zeit, in German But also the FAS was criticised for making \\"mistakes\\".Bei Gauland hat die \\"FAS\\" Fehler gemacht, Die Welt In September 2017, a video emerged of Gauland in which he said that Germany should \\"be proud of\\" its soldiers in both world wars and people should no longer \\"reproach\\" Germans for the Second World War. He was quoted as saying: \\"If the French are rightly proud of their emperor and the Britons of Nelson and Churchill, we have the right to be proud of the achievements of the German soldiers in two world wars\\". He continued, \\"If I look around Europe, no other people has dealt as clearly with their past wrongs as the Germans.\\" In response, Germany's justice minister tweeted that the statements showed that Gauland's AfD was on the extreme right. Gauland's comment was defended by numerous right-leaning supporters both publicly and on social media. Position in the AfD Gauland is one of the party founders. From 2013 to 2017, he was party leader in the state Brandenburg and entered the Landtag of Brandenburg in the 2014 election. He resigned as party leader in Brandenburg, when he led the AfD in the 2017 German federal election next to Alice Weidel, with whom he's now leading the AfD group in the Bundestag. In December 2017, he was elected co-leader of the party next to Jörg Meuthen. In November 2019, he resigned as party leader. Personal life Gauland's life companion Carola Hein is editor of a local newspaper, the Märkische Allgemeine, which he had previously edited. As a 26-year-old man, Gauland suffered from depression. He also suffered a heart attack in 2007, and has been taking medication to lower his blood pressure ever since. Gauland is a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church.Gauland, Alexander in Norbert Beleke (ed.): Wer ist wer? Das deutsche Who’s Who. 42. Ausgabe 2003/2004, Schmidt-Römhild, Lübeck 2003, , p. 411.

Norway was represented by a Consulate, later upgraded as a Consulate General, in Manila from 1952 to 1956. A Norwegian embassy was established in 1967.

Ancestry and family Felician III originated from the gens (clan) Záh, which possessed several landholdings and villages in Nógrád County. According to historian György Györffy, the ancestor of the kindred was a leader of those Székely militiamen, who were settled for the purpose of border surveillance during the reign of Stephen I of Hungary. By the end of the 12th century, the kindred divided into several branches; due to incomplete data, there are only fragmented genealogical tables, and there is inability to connect the branches with each other. Felician's branch owned lands in the northern part of Nógrád County, at the border of Kishont County. Felician was born in the second half of the 1260s as one of the two sons of Záh II. His uncle was the influential prelate Job I, who served as Bishop of Pécs from 1252 until his death in 1280 or 1281. As a partisan of Duke Stephen, he reached the zenith of his influence in the period starting with the death of Béla IV, when he also held temporal offices in addition to his bishopric. Felician and his brother Job II were first mentioned – albeit without names – by a contemporary document in June 1272, when their father was already deceased. Both of them were still minors during the issue of the charter. Job II died sometimes after 1275, leaving Felician as the sole heir of the property and wealth of his branch. Following Bishop Job's death, Felician inherited his acquired lands, but it is possible he was still minor during that time. Felician also had a sister, who married Paul Balog from the Tombold branch.Engel: Genealógia (Genus Balog 4. Tombold branch) Felician disappears from the sources for the next two decades. Sometimes he married to an unidentified noblewoman. They had three children, his namesake son and heir Felician IV, and two daughters, Sebe, who married local county noble Kopaj Palásti, and Clara. Military and court career Felician next appears in contemporary records on 18 May 1301, shortly after the extinction of the Árpád dynasty, when acted as an arbitrator during a legal process, when the borders of Pöstyén (today part of Szécsény) in Nógrád County were determined and designated. The death of Andrew III resulted a civil war between various claimants to the throne—Charles of Anjou, Wenceslaus of Bohemia, and Otto of Bavaria—, which lasted for seven years. Hungary had actually disintegrated into about a dozen independent provinces, each ruled by a powerful lord, or oligarch. Among them was Matthew Csák, who dominated the northwestern parts of Hungary. He extended his influence over Nógrád County sometimes in the period between 1302 and 1308. Becoming the familiaris and confidant of Matthew Csák by then, Felician attended in a meeting in the Pauline Monastery of Kékes on the side of his lord on 10 November 1308, where the papal legate, Cardinal Gentile Portino da Montefiore managed to persuade Matthew to accept King Charles' rule. Three of the five noblemen, who escorted the oligarch, were landowners in Nógrád County, including Felician Záh and Simon Kacsics. The powerful oligarch Matthew Csák, Felician's lord until around 1318 The reconciliation between Charles I and Matthew Csák proved to be short-lived, as the oligarch did not want to accept the king's rule; therefore, he did not attend King Charles' third coronation, when he was crowned with the Holy Crown on 27 August 1310. Moreover, Matthew Csák still continued to expand the borders of his domains and occupied several castles in the northern part of the kingdom. In the same time, Felician raided and pillaged the village of Baj in Pilis County, which then belonged to the property of the Diocese of Veszprém, according to a charter dated October 1310. It is possible that he is also identical with that \\"Fulcyanus\\", who devastated the church estate of Vágszerdahely (present-day Dolná Streda, Slovakia), leading a Csák military force at the turn of 1311–1312. Charles I attempted to weaken the unity among Matthew's partisans through diplomatic means in the following years. According to a royal charter issued in September 1315, the king deprived three of the oligarch's servants of all their possessions and gave those to Palatine Dominic Rátót, because they absolutely supported Matthew Csák's all efforts and did not ask for the king's grace. One of these sanctioned nobles was Felician, who remained a partisan of Matthew Csák even after an internal war between his familiares over the ownership of Jókő Castle (today Dobrá Voda, Slovakia) in 1316. After Csák's military defeats throughout in 1317, numerous faithful noblemen and soldiers left his dominion and allegiance to join the royal camp. Around 1318, Felician also became a partisan of Charles I, who forgave his former infidelity, thus he managed to retain his possessions in Nógrád County. He elevated into a confidential status in the royal court, while his youngest daughter Clara was made maid of honour of Queen Elizabeth. Matthew Csák died on 18 March 1321, his province collapsed shortly thereafter, because most of his former castellans yielded without resistance. Charles I donated the fort of Cseklész to Abraham the Red for Sempte (present-day Bernolákovo and Šintava in Slovakia, respectively) in 1323, which thus became a royal castle. Felician was made castellan of Sempte around 14 March 1326, that is the only piece of information, when he was mentioned in this capacity. In September 1328, already Lawrence the Tót (father of Palatine Nicholas Kont) and his brother Ugrin held the position. Additionally, Felician was not referred as castellan already in June 1327, when one of his servants Pető was involved in a murder case. Historian Krisztina Tóth argued Felician was replaced as castellan of Sempte, because the tensions between Charles and Frederick the Fair, Duke of Austria were emerged during that time, which resulted the growing importance of Sempte, thus the king assured that an old ally, Lawrence would supervise the royal castle. In the summer of 1328 Hungarian and Bohemian troops jointly invaded Austria and routed the Austrian army on the banks of the Leitha River. When Charles signed a peace treaty with the three dukes of Austria on 21 September 1328, Lawrence was also present, demonstrating his local importance. After his replacement, Felician moved to his lands in Gömör County. He resided in his estate of Gice (today Hucín, Slovakia) in December 1327. His neighbor and old nemesis Ladislaus Ákos filed a lawsuit against Felician and his namesake son, but they were not present at local county court. Later land donations confirm that Charles I ruled in favor of Felician in the upcoming lawsuits against Ladislaus, thus he did not fall out of the king's favor, but certainly lost political influence. In January 1329, Felician complained that one of his familiares, French, son of Benedict left his service and stole 100 marks. He decided to punish the insult: on 19 February, his soldiers invaded French's house and captured his servant John and swineherd Bene. They were subsequently tortured to death. French denied the accusation of theft, and Nicholas Treutel, the ispán of Pozsony County forced the parties to duel. However, Felician and French finally agreed with each other. Felician summoned 30 nobles, who justified his accusations: subsequently, French had to pay 60 marks as compensation. The document issued on 10 August also stated that if Felician dies in the meantime, his son, Felician IV owes the remaining debt, which French had to pay nineteen days later, on 29 August. This short period of time confirms Felician's advancing age and, probably, declining health. Failed regicide Assassination attempt and death On 17 April 1330, Wednesday, Felician Záh, stormed into the dining room of the royal palace at Visegrád with a sword in his hand and attacked the royal family. He wounded both Charles and the queen on their right hand and attempted to kill their two sons, Louis and Andrew, before the royal guards killed him.
