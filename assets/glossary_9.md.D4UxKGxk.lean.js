Gaines, Jr. is a Social Psychologist and Senior Lecturer in the School of Social Sciences at Brunel University. Gaines is the lead author of Culture, Ethnicity, and Personal Relationship Processes, published by Routledge in 1997 (). Personal and biographical information Gaines earned a PhD in psychology from the University of Texas in 1991. Throughout this time he had the support of a UT-Austin graduate fellowship, a National Science Foundation graduate fellowship, and a Macalester College pre-doctoral fellowship. After graduate school he spent two years as a post-doctoral fellow and soon after served as an assistant professor of Psychology and Black Studies at Pomona College from 1993-2000. On June 30, 2000, Gaines’ contract expired and he was forced to leave Pomona College after being denied lifetime tenure. This followed with threat of Gaines going on a hunger strike and led him to “fight the College’s immoral, unethical, and illegal behavior toward me.” In 1996 he received a Ford Foundation fellowship to do more research at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. In 2000, Gaines spent a year as a Fulbright Scholar at the University of the West Indies, and from 2001 to now, Gaines has been working as a senior lecturer at Brunel University. Gaines is also a chair member of the International Association for Relationship Research, an Editorial Advisory Board member for the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, and a research fellow for the University of Bath. Discussion of major area of work As a trained social psychologist, Gaines specializes in close relationships and statistics. He has been able to publish in both mainstream and African-centered publications. His current research focuses on the links between objective poverty and individuals’ experience of inner wellbeing across time, among married men and women, and single women heading households in rural villages within India and Zambia. Gaines’ main areas of research include close relationships, culture and ethnicity, gender psychology, intergroup relations, interpersonal processes, personality and individual difference, prejudice and stereotyping, and research methods and assessment. Gaines is also the author Culture, Ethnicity, and Personal Relationship Processes published by Routledge in 1997. Modelling Psychological Responses to the Great East Japan Earthquake and Nuclear Incident (2012) In March 2011, an earthquake and then a major tsunami and a nuclear incident struck Eastern Japan. This study models the individual differences in the risk perceptions of these major events. It studies the implications of these perceptions on the relevant behaviors surrounding them. The study collected data 11–133 weeks after the events from 844 young respondents in three regions of Japan; Miyagi, Yokyo, and Western Japan. The study showed that there were shared normative concerns about the earthquake and nuclear risks along with conservation values, lack of trust in government aid and advice, and poor personal control of the nuclear incident. All of these were positively correlated with perceived earthquake and nuclear risks. Many of these perceptions predicted specific outcomes, such as leaving their homes or even Japan. The study found that there were significant relationships between the respondent's individual values, their normative concerns of their friends and family, their sense of control over the threats, and their trust in the government's aid. All of these risk perceptions now predict a change in preventative measures that will be taken in the future. Avoidance behaviors are including many different safety measures (keeping first aid kits, modifying living quarters, wearing masks, and even contemplating leaving the country). There were, however, significant differences between regions in how they responded to the threat. There was great repeat earthquake anticipation in Tokyo, and behavioral changes were more prominent in areas affected by the March 2011 events. Trust in the government as far as their risk perception is concerned, was also lowered after the events. Impact of Experiences with Racism on African-Descent Persons’ Susceptibility to Stereotype Threat Within the United Kingdom (2008) This study on 103 people in the United Kingdom examined the impact of individual, institutional, cultural, and collective racism on a person's susceptibility to stereotype among African-descent persons. The study found that different experiences with these types of racism were not significant when relating to the susceptibility to stereotype threat. This was contrary to the study's original hypothesis. The only significant indicator came with experiences in collective racism and it showed that it was a positive predictor of susceptibility. This study dealt with implications for the continuing relevance of Erving Goffman's Symbolic Interactionist Theory and Construct of Stigma. It also related strongly to Claude Steele's construct of stereotype threat to the field of Black psychology. While previous research on stereotype threat has mostly focused on academic aspects, this study decided to branch out and focus on stereotype threat on a wide range throughout the United Kingdom. Stereotype threat means the anxiety and potentially impaired performance that comes from the social stigma of inferiority an individual believes has already been evaluated in their domain. The study was considered relatively new, due to the fact that the majority of stereotype threat studies have been done in the United States. The hypothesis for the study was that the UK, like the US, would have high incidences of stereotype threat among African-descent people. In the study, 49 of the participants were men and 64 were women, and the average age of the participants was 28.12 years old. The entire study consisted of a snowball sampling for participants within the West London area. They were first given the consent document and then asked to complete the study survey about stereotype threat. The most prominent finding from the study came from the significant positive effect of experience with collective racism on an African-descent persons’ susceptibility to stereotype threat. The effect was significant even after controlling for the other forms of racism. The study drew a connection in stereotype threat in modern times to a history where White mobs would gang up on Black individuals as a form of collective racism. The rest of the forms of racism were found to be insignificant, and this was noted as very surprising and unexpected. While the study was innovative for its area, it was also narrow and impractical. Their future research needs to have more lifelike scenarios instead of solely depending on an objective survey to find out about people's experiences. Individual definitions and sensitivities to racism can also be called into question. When comparing across a large spectrum of people, the study needs to make sure that all of the answers are relative and using a similar type of scale. The article also should have been more detailed about what the actual survey consisted of. However, the researchers did a good job staying unbiased. Although they inserted opinions into the article, they did not make conclusions or question the data because of it. Overall, the study was interesting and informative while researching an ever-changing topic. Other references * Plous, S. (2009, December 21). Stanley O.

It is situated 4 miles from Ballymena, only a short walk from the village of Cullybackey. The thatched cottage and interpretive centre detail the story of President Arthur and his road to the Presidency. Features It sits in an elevated position on Gourley's Hill. It is constructed of local stone and its walls are some 20 inches thick; bog oak beams support the thatched roof of local flax. It is earthen-floored with a cobble-stoned hearth. The simple rectangular cottage consists of two rooms, each the full width of the building. One room is a kitchen/living room, while the other serves as a bedroom (with access to a second bed in the loft above it). Latter additions to the building were removed to restore the cottage to its original condition. Arthur family President Arthur's grandparents, Alan Arthur (born 1761) and Eliza Arthur (née Meharg) lived in Cullybackey at Arthur Cottage. Their son, William (the President's father) was born on 5 December 1797 in the cottage and emigrated, with other members of the family, to North America between 1816 and 1820. There he met and married Malvina Stone and earned his living as a Baptist minister. Chester A. Arthur was born on 5 October 1829 at Fairfield, Vermont. He became president on 20 September 1881. The President's sister, Mary, and his schoolboy son, Chester Alan Jr., visited the Arthur homestead in 1882 and made contact with various members of the Arthur family who were living in the district. Access The cottage is open to the public from May to September. There are regular period-costume and craft days to show what life would have been like in the house when it was occupied 200 years ago, as well as music and story-telling events. Traditional soda bread and pancake baking demonstrations by women dressed in period costume also take place on organised days.

More generally, the condition can be formulated for functions between any two metric spaces. The number α is called the exponent of the Hölder condition. A function on an interval satisfying the condition with α > 1 is constant. If α = 1, then the function satisfies a Lipschitz condition. For any α > 0, the condition implies the function is uniformly continuous. The condition is named after Otto Hölder. We have the following chain of strict inclusions for functions over a closed and bounded non-trivial interval of the real line : Continuously differentiable ⊂ Lipschitz continuous ⊂ α-Hölder continuous ⊂ uniformly continuous = continuous where 0 < α ≤ 1. Hölder spaces Hölder spaces consisting of functions satisfying a Hölder condition are basic in areas of functional analysis relevant to solving partial differential equations, and in dynamical systems. The Hölder space Ck,α(Ω), where Ω is an open subset of some Euclidean space and k ≥ 0 an integer, consists of those functions on Ω having continuous derivatives up to order k and such that the kth partial derivatives are Hölder continuous with exponent α, where 0 < α ≤ 1. This is a locally convex topological vector space. If the Hölder coefficient : f |_{C^{0,\\\\alpha}} = \\\\sup_{x eq y \\\\in \\\\Omega} \\\\frac{f(x) - f(y) |}{\\\\|x-y\\\\|^\\\\alpha}, is finite, then the function f is said to be (uniformly) Hölder continuous with exponent α in Ω. In this case, the Hölder coefficient serves as a seminorm. If the Hölder coefficient is merely bounded on compact subsets of Ω, then the function f is said to be locally Hölder continuous with exponent α in Ω. If the function f and its derivatives up to order k are bounded on the closure of Ω, then the Hölder space C^{k,\\\\alpha}(\\\\overline{\\\\Omega}) can be assigned the norm : \\\\f \\\\|_{C^{k, \\\\alpha}} = \\\\|f\\\\|_{C^k}+\\\\max_{\\\\beta = k} \\\\left D^\\\\beta f \\\\right |_{C^{0,\\\\alpha}} where β ranges over multi-indices and :\\\\|f\\\\|_{C^k} = \\\\max_{\\\\beta \\\\leq k} \\\\sup_{x\\\\in\\\\Omega} \\\\left |D^\\\\beta f (x) \\\\right |. These seminorms and norms are often denoted simply f |_{0,\\\\alpha} and \\\\f \\\\|_{k,\\\\alpha} or also f |_{0, \\\\alpha,\\\\Omega}\\\\; and \\\\f \\\\|_{k, \\\\alpha,\\\\Omega} in order to stress the dependence on the domain of f. If Ω is open and bounded, then C^{k,\\\\alpha}(\\\\overline{\\\\Omega}) is a Banach space with respect to the norm \\\\|\\\\cdot\\\\|_{C^{k, \\\\alpha}} . Compact embedding of Hölder spaces Let Ω be a bounded subset of some Euclidean space (or more generally, any totally bounded metric space) and let 0 < α < β ≤ 1 two Hölder exponents. Then, there is an obvious inclusion map of the corresponding Hölder spaces: :C^{0,\\\\beta}(\\\\Omega)\\\\to C^{0,\\\\alpha}(\\\\Omega), which is continuous since, by definition of the Hölder norms, we have: :\\\\forall f \\\\in C^{0, \\\\beta}(\\\\Omega): \\\\qquad f |_{0,\\\\alpha,\\\\Omega}\\\\le \\\\mathrm{diam}(\\\\Omega)^{\\\\beta-\\\\alpha} f |_{0,\\\\beta,\\\\Omega}. Moreover, this inclusion is compact, meaning that bounded sets in the ‖ · ‖0,β norm are relatively compact in the ‖ · ‖0,α norm. This is a direct consequence of the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem. Indeed, let (un) be a bounded sequence in C0,β(Ω). Thanks to the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem we can assume without loss of generality that un → u uniformly, and we can also assume u = 0. Then :|u_n-u|_{0,\\\\alpha}=|u_n|_{0,\\\\alpha}\\\\to 0, because :\\\\frac{|u_n(x)-u_n(y)|}{|x-y|^\\\\alpha} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{|u_n(x)-u_n(y)|}{|x-y|^\\\\beta}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\beta}} \\\\left |u_n(x)-u_n(y) \\\\right |^{1-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\beta}} \\\\le |u_n|_{0,\\\\beta}^{\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\beta}} \\\\left(2\\\\|u_n\\\\|_\\\\infty\\\\right)^{1-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\beta}}=o(1). Examples * If 0 < α ≤ β ≤ 1 then all C^{0,\\\\beta}(\\\\overline{\\\\Omega}) Hölder continuous functions on a bounded set Ω are also C^{0,\\\\alpha}(\\\\overline{\\\\Omega}) Hölder continuous. This also includes β = 1 and therefore all Lipschitz continuous functions on a bounded set are also C0,α Hölder continuous. * The function f(x) = xβ (with β ≤ 1) defined on [0, 1] serves as a prototypical example of a function that is C0,α Hölder continuous for 0 < α ≤ β, but not for α > β. Further, if we defined f analogously on [0,\\\\infty), it would be C0,α Hölder continuous only for α = β. * For α > 1, any α-Hölder continuous function on [0, 1] (or any interval) is a constant. * There are examples of uniformly continuous functions that are not α-Hölder continuous for any α. For instance, the function defined on [0, 1/2] by f(0) = 0 and by f(x) = 1/log(x) otherwise is continuous, and therefore uniformly continuous by the Heine-Cantor theorem. It does not satisfy a Hölder condition of any order, however. *The Weierstrass function defined by: ::f(x)=\\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} a^n\\\\cos \\\\left (b^n \\\\pi x \\\\right ), :where 0 is an integer, b \\\\geq 2 and ab>1+\\\\tfrac{3\\\\pi}{2}, is α-Hölder continuous with ::\\\\alpha=-\\\\frac{\\\\log(a)}{\\\\log(b)}.Hardy, G. H. “Weierstrass's Non-Differentiable Function.” Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 17, no. 3, 1916, pp. 301–325. JSTOR, JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/1989005. * The Cantor function is Hölder continuous for any exponent \\\\alpha \\\\le \\\\tfrac{\\\\log 2}{\\\\log 3}, and for no larger one. In the former case, the inequality of the definition holds with the constant C := 2. * Peano curves from [0, 1] onto the square [0, 1]2 can be constructed to be 1/2-Hölder continuous. It can be proved that when \\\\alpha > \\\\tfrac{1}{2} the image of a α-Hölder continuous function from the unit interval to the square cannot fill the square. * Sample paths of Brownian motion are almost surely everywhere locally α-Hölder for every \\\\alpha < \\\\tfrac{1}{2}. *Functions which are locally integrable and whose integrals satisfy an appropriate growth condition are also Hölder continuous. For example, if we let ::u_{x,r} = \\\\frac{1}{|B_r|} \\\\int_{B_r(x)} u(y) dy :and u satisfies ::\\\\int_{B_r(x)} \\\\left |u(y) - u_{x,r} \\\\right |^2 dy \\\\leq C r^{n+2\\\\alpha}, :then u is Hölder continuous with exponent α.See, for example, Han and Lin, Chapter 3, Section 1. This result was originally due to Sergio Campanato. *Functions whose oscillation decay at a fixed rate with respect to distance are Hölder continuous with an exponent that is determined by the rate of decay. For instance, if ::w(u,x_0,r) = \\\\sup_{B_r(x_0)} u - \\\\inf_{B_r(x_0)} u :for some function u(x) satisfies ::w \\\\left (u,x_0,\\\\tfrac{r}{2} \\\\right ) \\\\leq \\\\lambda w \\\\left (u,x_0,r \\\\right ) :for a fixed λ with 0 < λ < 1 and all sufficiently small values of r, then u is Hölder continuous. *Functions in Sobolev space can be embedded into the appropriate Hölder space via Morrey's inequality if the spatial dimension is less than the exponent of the Sobolev space. To be precise, if n < p \\\\leq \\\\infty then there exists a constant C, depending only on p and n, such that: ::\\\\forall u \\\\in C^1 (\\\\mathbf{R}^n) \\\\cap L^p (\\\\mathbf{R}^n): \\\\qquad \\\\|u\\\\|_{C^{0,\\\\gamma}(\\\\mathbf{R}^n)}\\\\leq C \\\\|u\\\\|_{W^{1,p}(\\\\mathbf{R}^n)}, :where \\\\gamma = 1 - \\\\tfrac{n}{p}. Thus if u ∈ W1, p(Rn), then u is in fact Hölder continuous of exponent γ, after possibly being redefined on a set of measure 0. Properties *A closed additive subgroup of an infinite dimensional Hilbert space H, connected by α-Hölder continuous arcs with α > 1/2, is a linear subspace. There are closed additive subgroups of H, not linear subspaces, connected by 1/2-Hölder continuous arcs. An example is the additive subgroup L2(R, Z) of the Hilbert space L2(R, R). *Any α-Hölder continuous function f on a metric space X admits a Lipschitz approximation by means of a sequence of functions (fk) such that fk is k-Lipschitz and ::\\\\|f-f_k\\\\|_{\\\\infty,X}=O \\\\left (k^{-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{1-\\\\alpha}} \\\\right ). :Conversely, any such sequence (fk) of Lipschitz functions converges to an α-Hölder continuous uniform limit f. *Any α-Hölder function f on a subset X of a normed space E admits a uniformly continuous extension to the whole space, which is Hölder continuous with the same constant C and the same exponent α. The largest such extension is: ::f^*(x):=\\\\inf_{y\\\\in X}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ f(y)+C|x-y|^\\\\alpha\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. *The image of any U \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^n under an α-Hölder function has Hausdorff dimension at most \\\\tfrac{\\\\dim_H(U)}{\\\\alpha}, where \\\\dim_H(U) is the Hausdorff dimension of U . *The space C^{0,\\\\alpha}(\\\\Omega), 0<\\\\alpha\\\\leq 1 is not separable. *The embedding C^{0,\\\\beta}(\\\\Omega)\\\\subset C^{0,\\\\alpha}(\\\\Omega), 0<\\\\alpha<\\\\beta\\\\leq 1 is not dense.

It was founded in 1921 by John Verderbar and named Oh Henry Park. The Willowbrook Ballroom is often cited as the last place Resurrection Mary danced before her death. Her ghost is said to appear at the ballroom at times, dancing with the patrons.O'Hara, Chicago Sun-Times. On Friday October 28, 2016 the Ballroom was gutted by a fire. The building was having work done on the roof where the fire was suspected of starting. Due to water pressure issues the fire department had to wait on tanker trucks, which caused a delay in getting the fire under control.Chicago Tribune.  History  Founded in 1921 by John Verderbar, an industrious Austrian immigrant. Verderbar purchased along wooded Archer Ave. He planned to build a peaceful weekend home. His son, Rudy Verderbar, was one of the throngs of young people who danced at the nearly 400 ballrooms and dance halls that thrived in the Chicago area during the mid-to-late 1910s. After dancing in an outdoor pavilion in Michigan, Rudy waged a relentless campaign to scrap the idea of a summer home and build an outdoor dance pavilion. After some research, his father agreed, and in 1921, the all wooden Oh Henry Park was built. It proved so popular, in 1923, the open-air pavilion was enlarged and a new 10-cents-a- dance policy was implemented. The ballroom was supposedly named after the Oh Henry candy bar, manufactured in Chicago by the Williamson Candy Company, who paid Verderbar for the naming rights. In 1930, the pavilion was destroyed in a devastating fire. Verderbar quickly assembled a team of 200 carpenters to construct an enormous outdoor dance floor in time for the next Saturday night. The remaining ten weeks of Oh Henry’s 1930 dance season drew even bigger crowds due to massive publicity touting the romantic aspects of \\"dancing under the stars.\\" Count Basie played Willowbrook Ballroom in the 1940s.On May 3, 1931, more than 1,700 invited guests and dignitaries danced the first dances in the new Oh Henry Ballroom. It had been built at the then-staggering Great Depression-era cost of $100,000. As Big Band fever spread throughout 1940s America, the Oh Henry Ballroom, now with air conditioning, became a major force in the Midwest’s entertainment industry. Even during the Second World War, typical weekly attendance was about 10,000 dancers. The ballroom’s popularity was reason for Chicago bus lines to be rerouted to provide direct service to and from the ballroom. Willowbrook Ballroom attracted some of the most popular bands of their times including Ozzie Nelson and his orchestra in the 1930s with lead singer Harriet Hilliard. The 1940s orchestras of Harry James, Les Brown and Count Basie played the ballroom, and singers Frank Sinatra, Doris Day And Helen O'Connell graced the stage, later so did Wayne King, Guy Lombardo, Sammy Kaye, Jimmy Dorsey, Bob Crosby, Dick Jurgens, Glenn Miller Orchestra and Gene Krupa. In 1955, as ballrooms across the country scaled down or closed, the Verderbars set out on a course to further expand their operations. A addition installed new kitchens, a restaurant and a private room for parties and banquets. In 1959 the entire Oh Henry complex was renamed Willowbrook Ballroom. The 1960s were bringing record crowds to the ballroom, but toward the end of that decade, the public’s taste in entertainment underwent a radical change and fewer people took up ballroom dancing. Willowbrook Ballroom survived by having contemporary bands share the stage on the same evening with the top ballroom bands. As popular music changed, the entertainers on Willowbrook’s stage also changed, particularly on Friday night. Chubby Checker played the ballroom as did The Cryan' Shames, The Association, The Buckinghams, Otis Day and the Knights, The Village People, and Martha Reeves. Songwriter James Holvay first saw Carl Bonafede at the age of 14 when Carl was singing at The Willowbrook Ballroom as a front man for the Gem-Tones. It was one of Jim Lounsbury's local record hops. Bierig, Joel (2016). The Screaming Wildman. Chicago IL: Chi-Town Music History. p. 216. . In 1997 the Verderbar family sold the Ballroom to Birute and Gediminas Jodwalis. The Willowbrook Ballroom is located at 8900 Archer Avenue, Willow Springs, Illinois, 60480. In 2000 The Willowbrook Ballroom was profiled as one of America's \\"Glorious, Historic, Legendary, Treasured Ballroom Dance Floors\\" in Amateur Dancers magazine.Meyer, Amateur Dancers Criteria for being profiled as an Amateur Dancers magazine's \\"Finest Floor\\" is: #A minimum of of danceable wood flooring, sprung preferred. #Sufficient room for 300 or more dancers. #Adequate sound and heating/cooling system. #Currently operating with a 25-year history or more.

The United States Senate refused to ratify the treaty, and consequently Turkey annulled the concession. It was an award of the significant importance and marked the introduction of U.S. capital for the first time on a large scale into the Near East. The same type of agreement (Baghdad Railway) was a major cause of the anxiety that led the Ottoman Empire to World War I. Germany had obtained concessions from Ottoman Empire that allowed German companies to construct railways. The U.S. corporation would have the rights to all the mineral resources, including oil fields, found within a 20-kilometer zone on each side of the railway lines, as well as the privilege of carrying on subsidiary activities such as the laying of pipelines, the utilization of water power for construction, and the building of port and terminal facilities on the Black Sea and the Gulf of Alexandretta. The corporation could utilize the resources of the public lands, including sandpits, gravel pits, quarries and timber, without compensation and was granted exemption from taxation. Retired Rear-Admiral Colby Mitchell Chester led the U.S. syndicate, thus the name Chester concession was employed, although the official name of the syndicate was the Ottoman-American Development Company.New International Encyclopedia Despite the Turkish government's desire to be free of foreign economic influence (which had caused their Ottoman predecessors a great loss of autonomy), the concession was approved because it would guarantee U.S. support at the Treaty of Lausanne, where negotiations were taking place regarding the relationship between the new Turkish state and the European powers.Karpat, Kemal. Turkey's Politics. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1959. (85, footnote 16) Also a factor was the Turkish government's pragmatic need to develop, which overwhelmed fears of imperialism. The railroad grant applied to an extension of the old Anatolian Railway from Ankara to Sivas, with a branch to the port of Samsun on the Black Sea; a line from Sivas to Erzurum and thence on to the Persian and Russian frontiers, with branches to the Black Sea ports of Tirebolu and Trebizond; a line from Ulukışla on the Baghdad Railway to Sivas via Kayseri; a railway from Sivas to Harput and thence to Mosul with branches to Bitlis and Van; and a railway from Harput to Yumurtalık, a port on the Gulf of Iskenderun. It was estimated that $300,000,000 would be needed to carry the plan through. The deal collapsed in part because of financing problems on the U.S. side, and in part because it called for the development of rail into the Basra province, which did not come under Turkish control (Basra became part of the British mandate),Barlas, Dilek. Etatism and Diplomacy in Turkey: Economic and Foreign Policy Strategies in an Uncertain World. Leiden: Brill, 1998 (90) and the British-controlled Turkish Petroleum Company. The French Foreign Office, on behalf of nationals with whose claims the Chester grant conflicted, despatched a note to the Ankara government in which it characterized the whole procedure as being deliberately unfriendly. In 1923, the Ankara Assembly abruptly declared that the concession had lapsed, owing to failure of the concessionaires to fulfill in the allotted time certain conditions of the grant; but Mr Clayton Kennedy, as the representative of the syndicate, went to Ankara in person and, it was reported in 1924, succeeded in reopening the question.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,716998,00.html References Turkey–United States relations History of the Republic of Turkey ","title":"Chester concession"},{"id":"4005923","text":"People's Court may refer to: East Asia * Supreme People's Court, the highest court of the People's Republic of China ** Local people's courts of the People's Republic of China * Local Courts of Vietnam, also known as People's Courts, which deal with legal issues at the district precinct levels * People's Court (Philippines), set up by the 1st Congress of the Commonwealth of the Philippines in 1945 Eastern Europe * People's Court (Soviet Union), a civil court of the Soviet Union * People's Court (Bulgaria), a temporary Fatherland Front–established court in Bulgaria active in 1944–1945 Germany * People's Court (Germany), a court established by Adolf Hitler to deal with those accused of political offences * People's Court (Bavaria), a Bavarian court from 1918–1924, that tried, among others, Adolf Hitler and other Beer Hall Putsch conspirators North Africa * Libyan People's Court, an emergency tribunal founded in Libya after the political change of 1 September 1969, to try officials of the Kingdom era Entertainment * The People's Court, the first widely popular American \\"court show\\" in which actual small claims court cases were heard by a pseudo-judicial arbitrator * La Corte del Pueblo, the Spanish-language version of The People's Court that aired on the Telemundo network See also * Supreme People's Court (disambiguation) * Court of public opinion * Kangaroo court * People’s Tribunal (disambiguation) ","title":"People's Court"},{"id":"4005924","text":"Féile FM was a community radio station based at Conway Mill in the Gaeltacht Quarter in west Belfast. The station first broadcast in July 1996 on a 28-day restricted service licence, operating as an outlet for the west Belfast community. Within two years, Féile FM began broadcasting for two four-week periods each year, providing a buildup to Féile an Phobail's Draíocht Children's Arts Festival, their West Belfast Festival and the St Patrick's Day events. The station was operated under the banner of Féile an Phobail by a radio co-ordinator and a large number of volunteers from the local community. Volunteers were involved in many aspects of the station from hospitality, telephones, news team, production, presenters and even managers. History Over the first nine years, Féile FM broadcast on the same frequency of 106.2 FM. This frequency changed to 107.7 FM for the radio broadcast in July/August 2005. Although the station had been a roving unit for many years, broadcasting from various venues, it returned to Conway Mill in February 2004 to a purpose- built studio with a full studio and modern equipment. The studio was created through a partnership between Féile an Phobail and Conway Mill and was funded by the Belfast Local Strategy Partnership. In October 2005, Féile FM was granted a full-time community radio licence by Ofcom. The terms of the licence allowed Féile FM to take two years to develop the radio station. After the period of two years, Féile FM was granted permission to broadcast throughout the year as opposed to its previous restrictions on broadcasting only in the run-up to St. Patrick's Day and the West Belfast Festival. This allowed the station to provide a full-time community radio service to the entire city of Belfast and across area of counties Antrim and Down. The station closed at 4pm on Friday 25 March 2011 owing to financial difficulties and increasing overhead costs.Statement on the closure of Féile FM, Féile FM, 25 March 2011Féile FM: Cash crisis puts Belfast radio station jobs in jeopardy, Belfast Telegraph, 25 March 2011 References External links *Féile FM Website *Féile an Phobail Website Radio stations in Northern Ireland Mass media in Belfast Community radio stations in the United Kingdom Defunct radio stations in the United Kingdom ","title":"Féile FM"},{"id":"4005928","text":"The Nymphomyiidae are a family of tiny (2 mm) slender, delicate flies (Diptera). Larvae are found among aquatic mosses in small, rapid streams in northern regions of the world, including northeastern North America, Japan, the Himalayas, and eastern Russia. Many fossil species and a few extant species are known. Under an alternative classification, they are considered the only living representatives of a separate, suborder called Archidiptera (or Archaediptera) which includes several Triassic fossil members. The family has characteristics associated with the Nematocera as well as the Brachycera. The antennae are shortened as in the Brachycera and these flies are long, having a snout with vestigeal mouthparts, non-differentiated abdominal segments with large cerci. The wings are narrow and hair-fringed and have very weak venation. They are known to form cloud-like swarms in summer and the short-lived non-feeding adults have wings that fracture at the base shortly after mating. The family Nymphomyiidae has several species which were originally placed in separate genera of their own. Nymphomyia alba, the type species for this family, was discovered in a fast-flowing stream in Japan by Masaaki Tokunaga in 1932. This was followed by Palaeodipteron walkeri described by Ide in Quebec in 1965Ide, F.P. 1965. A fly of the archaic family Nymphomyiidae (Diptera) from North America. Canadian Entomologist, 97: 496-507. and Felicitomyia brundini was described from the Himalayas in 1970. Hennig examined the pupal characteristics of Nymphomyia and placed it in the family Psychodidae. Rohdendorf considered Nymphomyia so distinct that he put it in a separate superfamily Nymphomyioidea related to Triassic Dictyodipteridae which are in a suborder Archidiptera. Modern classifications put all the species in a single genus Nymphomyia. Based on larval morphology, the family has been suggested to be close to the Deuterophlebiidae while others place them in a separate infraorder, the Nymphomyiomorpha. Nymphomyiidae are neotenic, retaining various larval features. They have strap-like wings with a very reduced venation, and the wing margins have long fringes like those of the Thysanoptera. The wings break at the base after mating. The antennae are very reduced. Species in the genus Nymphomyia have atrophied mouthparts. Nymphomyiidae are unusual in that the adults are ventrally holoptic, meaning they possess two eyes that meet on the underside of the head. Adults form large swarms above water. One or two generations may breed in a single year depending on the region and climate.

His maternal grandfather was William Philip Molyneux, 2nd Earl of Sefton. Grenfell was elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Stoke-upon-Trent at a by-election in September 1862, and was re-elected at the general election in 1865. At the general election three years later, in 1868, he stood in the Liberal interest for South West Lancashire, but was defeated. He came forward again at the general election of 1880, standing for Barnstaple, but was again defeated. He was a leading member of the Bimetallic League, and Governor of the Bank of England between 1881 and 1883 following a period as its Deputy Governor. He was also a member of the Council of the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders and was on the boards of several insurance companies.

The FMTV is derived from the Austrian Steyr 12 M 18 truck, but substantially modified to meet U.S. Army requirements, these including a minimum 50 per cent U.S. content. There were originally 17 FMTV variants—four variants in the nominal 2.5 U.S. ton payload class, designated Light Medium Tactical Vehicle (LMTV), and 13 variants with a nominal 5 U.S. ton payload rating, called Medium Tactical Vehicle (MTV). Since the first FMTVs were fielded in January 1996 the family has been expanded and the overall design enhanced considerably. The FMTV was originally manufactured by Stewart and Stevenson (1996-2006), then by Armor Holdings (2006-2007), then by what is now BAE Systems Platforms & Services until 2011. It is currently manufactured by Oshkosh Corporation. On 13 October 2016 the U.S. Army solicited proposals for the FMTV A2 rebuy competition. On 7 February 2018 the U.S. Army announced the FMTV A2 contract had been awarded to Oshkosh Defense. Development and production history FMTV's origins trace back to a U.S. Army TRAining and DOctrine Command (TRADOC) requirements document issued in 1983 for a Medium Tactical Truck (MTT), the intended replacement for the in-service 2.5-ton truck. In July 1984 a program to look at a future 5-ton truck procurement to replace in-service 2.5- and 5-ton trucks began. Cost analysis demonstrated that the procurement should be for both 2.5- and 5-ton trucks, and in October 1984 FMTV formally began as a program. The Request For Proposals (RFP) for FMTV was released in 1988. At this time it was expected that around 120,000 trucks would be ordered over three five-year contracts. In October 1988, the U.S. Army awarded contracts to Stewart & Stevenson, the Tactical Truck Corporation (a 50/50 joint venture between General Motors Military Vehicles and the BMY Wheeled Vehicle Division of the HARSCO Corporation), and Teledyne Continental Motors for 15 prototype vehicles each, these to be completed by January 1989. In October 1991 a five-year FMTV contract was awarded to Stewart & Stevenson. The initial contract order total was expected to be 20,000 vehicles, but this was reduced to 10,843 vehicles valued at USD1.2 billion. Some options were added and raised the total to 11,197 vehicles over what would be extended to 7 contract years. The first FMTVs were fielded in January 1996. In October 1998 Stewart & Stevenson was awarded the second FMTV contract, this for 8,000 trucks and 1,500 companion trailers and with a value of $1.4 billion. Total quantities including options were 11,491 trucks and 2,292 trailers, delivered between September 1999 and October 2004. Trucks were the improved A1 model, with improvements including an uprated engine (1998 EPA compliant) and transmission, and the introduction of ABS. The first A1 models were fielded in July 2000. Stewart & Stevenson and Oshkosh Truck Corporation were awarded contracts in April 2001 for the Evaluation Phase (Phase 1) of the FMTV A1 Competitive Rebuy (FMTV A1 CR) program for the next FMTV production contract. Following trials and evaluation, in April 2003 the contract was awarded to Stewart & Stevenson. Production of the FMTV A1 CR (designated FMTV A1R) began in Q3 2004. Improvements to A1R models were numerous and included a new EPA 2004 compliant Caterpillar C7 engine. A total of 21,149 FMTVs and companion trailers were built under the FMTV A1R contract award. In May 2006, Stewart & Stevenson was acquired by Armor Holdings Inc., and in August 2007, Armor Holdings was acquired by BAE Systems. The U.S. Army had intended that the Future Tactical Truck System (FTTS) with just two variants would eventually replace virtually all of its tactical wheeled vehicle fleet including the FMTV. FTTS never materialized, however along with inputs from other efforts it continues to be used to define requirements for future U.S. Army trucks. With FTTS already faltering, BAE Systems was awarded a bridging contract in June 2008 for up to 10,000 FMTVs or trailers, the contract including an option (which was exercised) for 10,000 additional vehicles. In May 2009 BAE Systems, Navistar Defense and Oshkosh Defense each announced they had submitted proposals for the FMTV A1P2 competitive rebuy program to the U.S. Army's Tank- Automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) Life Cycle Management Command. In August 2009, the U.S. Army announced that Oshkosh Defense had been awarded the FMTV A1P2 rebuy production contract. The award was protested by both BAE Systems and Navistar. The FMTV A1P2 rebuy was awarded as a five-year 'build- to-print' requirements-type award that at award allowed the U.S. government to order from 0 up to 12,415 trucks and 10,926 trailers through to calendar year 2014. Some FMTV variants are excluded from the rebuy competition, those excluded include specialist FMTV variants such as HIMARS, Patriot, MEADS and LVAD, plus all the armored cabs developed by BAE Systems. According to the U.S. Army (in February 2012) all FMTV work with BAE Systems (minus a small number of armor B-kits) had concluded, BAE Systems and legacy companies having delivered around 74,000 FMTV trucks and trailers to the U.S. Army. U.S. budgetary projections of March 2012 suggested that due to funding constraints the FMTV program would be terminated in FY14. Under the FMTV contract orders could be placed until December 2013, with first deliveries to commence within one year of that, with final deliveries one year later. Contract extensions have been made and the Justification and Approval (J&A;) notice for the latest of these, which will extend the FMTV contract from 30 September 2016 to 25 August 2019 and will allow for the continued procurement of FMTV A1P2s, was released on 14 October 2016. One day earlier, on 13 October 2016 the U.S. Army solicited proposals for the FMTV A2 rebuy competition. On 11 January 2017 Israel's Ministry of Defense announced it would be acquiring 200 FMTVs from Oshkosh in a contract valued at $200 million. Deliveries are expected to start this year and conclude mid-2018. The MoD noted that additional orders are likely. At this time Oshkosh confirmed that since deliveries started in 2010, the company had received orders for over 24,500 FMTV trucks and 11,400 FMTV trailers. On 21 September 2017 Oshkosh announced that the U.S. Army had announced an administrative modification to the FMTV A1P2 requirements contract with the company, this to establish the eighth, ninth and tenth Order Years’ pricing under the contract, at an estimated value of $466 million. This administrative modification authorizes future orders under the FMTV A1P2 contract through August 25, 2019. This contract extension will close out production of the FMTV A1P2. On 21 September an order for 1,065 FMTVs at a value of $260.1 million under Order Year 8 of the latest contract extension was announced. On 27 September a further two Order Year 8 orders for a total of 148 FMTVs valued at more than $36 million was announced, with Oshkosh also confirming that the company had delivered more than 36,200 FMTV trucks and trailers. On 6 November Oshkosh announced the delivery of the 25,000th FMTV truck to the US Army. On 14 June 2018 Oshkosh announced that the U.S. Army Contracting Command had placed four additional orders for a total of 771 FMTV A1P2s, valued at $159.6 million. Oshkosh Defense announced on 27 February 2019 that the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) Life Cycle Management Command (LCMC) had placed orders with the company for a further 354 FMTV A1P2 trucks and trailers at a value of $75 million. By February 2019, Oshkosh had delivered more than 38,100 trucks since the award of the FMTV A1P2 contract. On 28 June 2019 the US Department of Defence announced that Oshkosh had been awarded a $320,000,000 modification to domestic and Foreign Military Sales (Argentina, Djibouti, Iraq, Lebanon, Romania) contract W56HZV-09-D-0159 for procurement of Family of Medium Tactical Vehicle variants. Estimated completion date is 24 August 2021. Technical description and variants The 2.5-ton (4x4) FMTV is designated as the Light Medium Tactical Vehicle (LMTV), while the 5-ton (6x6) is designated the Medium Tactical Vehicle (MTV). The FMTV is based on the Austrian Steyr 12 M 18 (4x4) truck, but substantially modified to meet U.S. Army requirements that included a minimum 50% US content. The original 15 FMTV prototypes were assembled in Austria and while based on the 12 M 18 chassis-cab, were fitted with a number of US- supplied/specification components including a Caterpillar diesel engine, Allison automatic transmission and Meritor drive axles. In a move away from previous U.S. Army designs, a Cab Over Engine (COE) design was selected for the FMTV as while the US Army did not specify this configuration, given the Cold War situation prevailing at the time it had indicated that overall length for shipboard transport was a consideration. On a model-for-model basis the FMTV is around 3 ft. shorter than its bonneted predecessors, while retaining a C-130 Hercules transport capability. Subject to load dimensions, all original FMTV variants are C-130 transportable at GVWR and all models capable of being transported underslung by helicopter are fitted with a sliding outrigger system. Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System (LAPES), later revised to Low Velocity Air Drop (LVAD) variants of A0 production LMTV (M1081 cargo) and MTV (M1093 cargo and M1094 dump) variants were produced. The chassis and cab of the FMTV feature extensive corrosion protection. It was the first truck to pass the U.S. Army's 22-year accelerated corrosion test. The design of FMTV has never remained static and to further increase reliability, user friendliness and operational flexibility, detailed refinements/upgrades have continued throughout FMTVs production run. FMTV is built around a conventional bolted / huck-bolted, cold-formed C-section chassis with bolted-in tubular cross-members. The high-grade 758 MPa steel used is sourced from Sweden. LMTV variants can be fitted with a DP-10J winch with an 11,000 lb. line pull. MTV variants use a DP-515 winch with a 15,500 lbs. line pull. Current production FMTV A1P2s are powered by a 2007 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emissions compliant 7.2-liter six-cylinder Caterpillar C7 diesel engine developing 275 hp and 860 Lb.-Ft. torque in LMTV variants and 330 hp and 860 Lb-Ft.torque in MTV variants. FMTV A1Rs have a 2004 EPA emissions compliant version of the same engine with the same power output. FMTV A1 variants have an earlier 1998 EPA emissions compliant version of this engine, the 3126 ATAAC which developed 275 hp at 2400 rpm and 815 Lb.-Ft.torque at 1600 rpm in LMTV variants and 330 hp and 850 Lb.-Ft.torque in MTV variants. A 6.6-liter derivative of this engine, the 3116 ATAAC, was fitted to FMTV A0 models where it developed 225 hp and 735 Lb.-Ft. torque in LMTV variants, and 290 hp at 2600 rpm and 860 Lb.-Ft. torque in MTV variants. The Allison 3070 SP seven- speed transmission fitted to A1P2 and A1R FMTVs has also evolved with the FMTV, its A1 designation being MD 3070 PT, its A0 designation being MD-D7. This has an integral single-speed transfer case. All-wheel drive is full-time, with a 30/70 per cent front/rear torque split for on-road driving, and a 50/50 per cent split for off-road driving. All FMTV models are fitted with Meritor beam axles, the ratings and specifications of which have also evolved as the FMTV has developed. Suspension is by a combination of parabolic tapered leaf springs (inverted on the MTV rear bogie), shock-absorbers, and an anti-roll bar for the rear axle/bogie; Two cargo trailers are part of the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV). The M1082 single-axle trailer is used with the LMTV cargo truck and the M1095 twin-axle trailer is use with the MTV cargo truck. Both trailers have payloads that match that of the towing truck, and they share many components (including axles) with the towing truck.

When it entered production, armoring was not considered an option for the FMTV. The first protection solution for the FMTV was not in answer to such scenarios, but was developed by Stewart & Stevenson and O'Gara- Hess & Eisenhardt Armoring Company (OHE). Called the Crew Protected Cab, it was specifically for the HIMARS variant and offered flash and Foreign Object Debris (FOD) protection during launch. Designs followed for an Enhanced Crew Protected Cab, and later an Armor Protected Cab, each adding more ballistic capability against direct fire, artillery burst and mines. To meet emerging threats on deployed operations, in March 2004 DRS Technical Services was awarded a $16.3 million contract to provide 272 armor protection kits for the FMTV. A total of 1,862 kits are understood to have been produced in total. These kits were based around ballistic-protection panels installed on standard FMTV cabs. In answer to demands for greater crew protection, BAE Systems developed the Low Signature Armored Cab (LSAC) for all variants of the FMTV. The LSAC replaced the standard FMTV cab (with which it shares internals) in a remove and replace operation. To meet the US Army's current Long Term Armor Strategy (LTAS) for armored cabs, BAE Systems developed the LTAS cab for the FMTV. BAE Systems states that it produced over 9,000 LTAS cabs for the FMTV A1P2 variant. All Oshkosh FMTV vehicles include the company's own LTAS- compliant armor solution. LTAS is based around the A and B kit principles, this allowing for vehicles to be armored as required, and with the add-on applique package adaptable to prevailing threats and upgradeable as new armoring technologies emerge. The A-Kit, which includes a new cab, modifies the FMTV to allow the addition of armour; the B-Kit being the bulk of the armor itself. The Caiman Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle is based on the MTV A1R platform. The U.S. Marines placed an initial order with the then Armor Holdings for 1,170 Caiman in July 2007. In total 2,868 Caiman were ordered, with deliveries completed during November 2008. BAE Systems unveiled the Caiman MultiTerrain Vehicle (MTV) at AUSA in Winter 2010. The Caiman MTV is a modified version of the base Caiman that features a revised driveline, new chassis and upgraded fully independent suspension. BAE Systems received contracts to upgrade 2071 (1700 + 371) Camian to Caiman MTV standard, these upgrades completed Q1/Q2 2014. Post-Afghanistan no Caiman MRAPs have been retained by U.S. armed forces, although some have been transferred to U.S. law enforcement agencies. Others have been offered as Excess Defense Articles (EDA) to Iraq, Jordan, Nigeria and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). BAE Systems unveiled the Caiman Light (CLT) in 2008, a five-man 4x4 version of the Caiman. To meet the Iraqi Light Armored Vehicle Requirement (ILAV) BAE Systems offered a fully armored LMTV on which the LSAC cab was extended rearwards into a troop carrying body. Neither of these proposals entered production.  Prototype and developmental FMTVs  *Working with Multidrive an LMTV was integrated with a powered companion trailer to produce a C-130 Hercules transportable vehicle with a 15,000 kg payload. *The FMTV Hybrid Hydraulic Vehicle (HHV) was selected as the test platform for the development of a hybrid hydraulic propulsion system. *The FMTV was selected as the platform to demonstrate that a 155 mm M777 howitzer and prime mover could, for the first time, be deployed in the same C-130 aircraft. *Stewart & Stevenson produced five hybrid electric FMTVs, each tailored for a specific application. *Stewart & Stevenson developed an 11-ton FMTV A1 demonstrator to demonstrate the growth potential of the FMTV family and C4ISR integration potential, via technology insertions, while retaining maximum commonality with the current FMTV fleet. A second vehicle with a tilt-type loadbad was also developed as part of the aborted Future Tactical Truck System (FTTS) requirement. A 13-ton demonstrator then followed. *Stewart & Stevenson developed a 13-ton Medium Tactical Truck Demonstrator (MTTD) that incorporated many of the technologies and capabilities that the Army then envisioned for its future trucks. *A number of 8x8 FMTVs have also been developed, these including examples for Australia's Land 121 (awarded to Rheinmetall MAN Military Vehicles (RMMV)), a 13-ton demonstrator with a load handling system, and a pair of chassis as part of the Future Tactical Truck System (FTTS) undertaking. *Oshkosh Corporation unveiled the FMTV Enhanced Protection & Mobility Demonstrator (EPMD) during 2012. The FMTV EPMD is fitted with Oshkosh's TAK-4 independent suspension system and a custom-fitted Oshkosh Underbody Improvement Kit (UIK). * To help inform the U.S. Army’s FMTV A2 acquisition strategy and performance upgrade requirements Nevada Automotive Test Center was awarded a contract in 2014 to manufacture and test two FMTV Technology Demonstrators. These are based on government-supplied M1157 A1P2 10-ton Dump chassis produced by Oshkosh, but upgraded by NATC. Testing concluded in February 2016.  FMTV A2 requirement  Early in 2014 the U.S. Army's Program Executive Officer for Combat Support and Combat Service Support (CS CSS) had suggested that the Army would be seeking a new medium truck family in the mid-2020s. On 13 October 2016 the U.S. Army solicited proposals for the FMTV A2 rebuy competition. The FMTV A2 request for proposals (RfP) stated the programme would seek \\"to integrate higher capacity suspension, wheels, and tires; integrate underbody protection; increase engine power; integrate higher capacity alternator; integrate data bus upgrade; and integrate safety enhancements\\". The winner of the contract would be asked to integrate such upgrades; build the vehicles, trailers, and kits; and provide programme, maintenance, and logistics support. According to the RfP, the FMTV A2 contract is expected to cover five ordering years with two additional one-year option periods for a potential total of 2,400 vehicles if all options are exercise. In a subsequent statement an Army spokesman said the RfP: \\"includes an estimated quantity of approximately 2,400 new production vehicles. However, the actual quantities in any future award are undetermined and will depend on proposed pricing for this quantity, army requirements, and available funding.\\" Oshkosh will build A2 FMTVs Oshkosh announced on 8 May 2017 that the company had submitted a proposal in response to the Request for Proposal (RFP) for Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) A2 production effort. At this point in time the U.S. Army anticipated a contract award announcement in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, and stated the next generation FMTV A2 would comprise 16 models and three trailers. The Army announced on 7 February 2018 it had selected Oshkosh to build to FMTV A2. The initial estimated contract value is $476.2 million with no cap on the number of vehicles the Army may purchase. The firm fixed price contract covers a five-year ordering period plus two additional one year options. The estimated date of completion has previously been quoted as February 2022. Both Oshkosh and AM General submitted bids for the requirement. Since receiving the FMTV A2 award, Oshkosh has started building vehicles in support of Production Verification Testing (PVT), Live Fire Testing (LFT) and logistics development. Oshkosh expects the FMTV A2 program to transition to low rate production in FY21. FMTVs are currently being reset at the Red River Army Depot on return from deployed operations, and current projections are for a Recap (Recapitalization) program to commence in 2020/2021.

Its members are trained to perform dangerous operations such as high-risk arrests and hostage situations. It is organizationally part of Oslo Police District, but is responsible for the whole country, including oil installations in the North Sea. The unit has participated in several incidents including the Torp hostage crisis at Sandefjord Airport, Torp on 29 September 1994, the aftermath of the NOKAS robbery and the 2011 Norway attacks. The members have a wider variety of weapons than the ordinary police force, including SIG Sauer P226 pistols and Diemaco C8 rifles. Members spend half their time training and preparing for missions and the remaining participating in ordinary law enforcement work in Oslo. Armed officer with an MP5 Operations According to Delta's web site, they conduct in average almost one armed operation every day. In 2004, for instance, they conducted 422 armed missions and only fired their weapons twice. One of Delta's most dramatic missions was the Torp hostage crisis, where an elderly couple and two police officers were taken hostages by two criminals. In the end of the two-day drama, Delta executed a rescue operation rescuing all of the hostages and killing one hostage taker and arresting the other. In the aftermath of the fatal NOKAS robbery, Delta arrested many suspects involved with the robbery. Since October 2006, Delta has focused their operations against gang crime in the capital of Oslo and arrested many criminals and seized many weapons used by the gangs. 2011 Oslo / Utøya attacks Delta were first responders at Utøya and subsequently apprehended Anders Behring Breivik, the perpetrator of the 2011 Norway attacks in Oslo and Utøya on 22 July 2011. Deployment in Special Team Six Members of the unit have been deployed in the multinational police unit, Special Team Six many times. Team Six has most notably served in Kosovo. One of the unit's most important tasks was to arrest war criminals. According to one of the Delta operators, during a rescue mission, grenades and bullets flew over their heads while Team Six rescued 50-60 persons from furious Albanians. This incident was a rescue of United Nations personnel trapped in a building. Team Six was commanded by a Norwegian operator from Delta during this mission and during the period January–July 2004. Beredskapstroppen has had personnel deployed in Team Six ever since its foundation.

A graduate of the University of Otago, his primary business interests are in Charlie's, a juice company. During the 1995 Rugby World Cup he scored six tries in the game against Japan, which is the record for the most tries by an individual in a Rugby World Cup match. NPC Ellis started out for Otago in the NPC in 1991 when he was playing for the club side University, and he was selected for the NZ Colts. He made a name for himself while playing for Otago, which earned him All Black selection in 1992. Ellis stayed with Otago until 1995 when he switched code to rugby league. In 1998, after two seasons of league, Ellis played for North Harbour in the NPC, where he remained for another two seasons. Ellis played his last season of NPC in 2000 for North Harbour. All Blacks Ellis first played for the All Blacks in 1992, against a South Australian Invitation XV, then against Australian club and invitation sides. He scored two tries in his first test, in 1993, at first five-eighth against Scotland, won 51–15 by the All Blacks. A week later he was selected for the test against England where he also played first five. Ellis played his last match of 1993 against the Barbarians. For the 1994 season, Ellis was not selected for the All Blacks and did not attend the NZ trial due to injury, but he did play for the New Zealand XV and New Zealand Universities sides. In 1995 Ellis was re-called to the All Blacks for the World Cup, playing five games on the wing. He scored seven tries in the tournament, six of them in the 145–17 win over Japan. Rugby league At the end of the 1995 season Ellis switched to league to play for the Auckland Warriors where he joined his All Blacks teammate John Kirwan. Ellis was Warrior number 29 when he played his first match in 1996. He played for the Warriors between 1996 and 1998, playing in 36 matches and scoring 103 points through 11 tries, 29 goals and 1 field goal. Ellis also represented the New Zealand national rugby league team, the Kiwis, in 5 matches. Super 12 Ellis missed out on the first few seasons of the Super 12 due to his rugby league career, but when he returned to rugby union in 1998 it was only a short time before he was into the Super 12. After playing a solid season for North Harbour in the NPC Ellis was picked for the Blues, where he played one season. In 1999, after strong seasons with North Harbour and the Blues, Ellis was named in one of the early training squads for the 1999 Rugby World Cup, but he was not selected in the final team and played for NZ A instead. In 2000 Ellis played his final Super 12 season for the Highlanders before retiring from rugby. Post playing career In the early 2000s, Ellis was a popular figure on New Zealand television, often appearing alongside fellow former rugby union and league player Matthew Ridge, notably on light-hearted documentaries. In 2004, as part of a one such programme, Ellis took part in and won the famous and eccentric British annual event, the Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake. From 1996 to 2005 Ellis was a regular presenter on the TV2 talk show SportsCafe, where he was known for his \\"larrikin\\" personality. In 2003 he inaugurated the mock public holiday \\"National Nude Day\\" by challenging viewers to streak in front of then Prime Minister Helen Clark. In 2006, he released his autobiography Crossing the Line, which details all aspects of his life. Ellis has since co-authored Good Fullas: A Guide to Kiwi Blokes, released in 2010 with friend and New Zealand Consul General to Italy, Charlie Haddrell. In 2010 the Gardens Tavern, then a popular student pub in North Dunedin, was advertised for sale; Ellis attempted to buy it but was outbid by the University of Otago, who converted it into a study centre. The university student magazine Critic alleges that the University bought it for the specific purpose of keeping it out of Ellis' hands. Controversy In 2005, Ellis purchased ecstasy tablets from a drug dealer who was under surveillance by the New Zealand Police. Ellis was among many high-profile figures caught in the operation, code-named Aqua. His court appearance put an end to a poorly-kept secret, as despite the fact he had originally obtained name suppression, his identity was widely known by the New Zealand public. Ellis was fined $300. On 15 November 2007, as part of an elaborate marketing ploy for his latest business venture, Ellis detonated 600 kg of explosives on top of Rangitoto Island, a nature reserve in Auckland's Waitematā Harbour. This was an attempt to create an illusion that the volcanic island was erupting. The New Zealand Department of Conservation described the stunt as \\"demoralising and very disappointing\\". There is a total fire ban on the island because of ecological significance. References External links *Marc Ellis at rugbymuseum.co.nz *The Listener 2004 Power List: Ellis is listed as no. 49.

Many of the tribal members, however, did not support the Confederacy, and, not being organized, were driven from Indian Territory with a large loss of life. Most fled to Kansas and Missouri. Many of the \\"Loyal\\" Indians volunteered for Union duty in order to get control back from the Confederate generals. The Indian Home Guard regiments fought mostly in Indian Territory and Arkansas.

He now represents New Zealand. Chris has won two World Championships in Association Croquet, in 1995 and again in 2008, six AC World Team Champs and one GC World Team Champs. 2008 was perhaps Chris's finest year, overtaking previous world champions Robert Fulford and Reg Bamford to regain the position of world number one player, which he held for in excess of 16 months. He also reached the semi-finals of the WCF Golf Croquet World Championships in March 2008 in Cape Town, South Africa and led the English team to the finals of the 2009 European team championships. Clarke now lives in Christchurch, New Zealand. On 30 January 2008 he was married to Jenny Clarke (née Williams), who plays for New Zealand. The pair were therefore due to be on opposing sides when Great Britain played New Zealand in the 2010 MacRobertson Shield, before Clarke withdrew with a back injury. In October 2012, Clarke returned to competitive association croquet singles, having won multiple Open doubles titles in the meantime as well as GC singles events where he rose to world number 2. In November 2012, he completed the requisite ten matches needed to return to the world rankings, which he did in first place. Clarke switched to represent New Zealand following his controversial non-selection for England's golf croquet squad, and was a member of their victorious 2014 MacRobertson Shield team, playing at number 1 where he was the winningmost player in the event. In 2016, Clarke played his last International event involving singles when he captained NZ to win the GC World Championship, once again being the winningmost player in the event. This victory made Clarke the first player to win three of the four WCF Open World Titles. He finished his career having won 9 World titles and never having lost a major International Test Match.

He served as an MP for the constituency of Dublin University in 1830–1841, Privy Councillor of Ireland in 1835–1869 and Lord Chief Justice of Ireland in 1852–1866. Early life Thomas Lefroy was born in Limerick, Ireland.http://limerickslife.com/limerick-changed-the-world/ He had an outstanding academic record at Trinity College, Dublin, from 1790 to 1793. His great-uncle, Benjamin Langlois, sponsored Tom's legal studies at Lincoln's Inn, London. One year later, Lefroy served as Auditor of Trinity's College Historical Society, the still-active debating society of the college. Later still, he became a prominent member of the Irish bar (having been called to it in 1797) and published a series of Law Reports on the cases of the Irish Court of Chancery. Tom Lefroy and Jane Austen In 1796, Lefroy began a flirtation with the young Jane Austen, who was a friend of an older female relative. Jane Austen wrote two letters to her sister Cassandra mentioning \\"Tom Lefroy\\", and some have suggested that it may have been he whom Austen had in mind when she invented the character of Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, as the courtship between Tom Lefroy and Jane Austen took place over the year or so that Pride and Prejudice was written. In his 2003 biography, Becoming Jane Austen, Jon Spence suggests that Jane Austen actually used her and Tom LeFroy's personalities as the models for Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet, but not in an expected way. Spence suggests that Jane Austen used Tom Lefroy's more gregarious personality as the model for the novel's heroine Elizabeth Bennet, and her own measured demeanor was used as the model for the male protagonist, Mr. Darcy. So while the exact influence of Tom Lefroy on Pride and Prejudice continues to be debated, it does seem certain that his presence in Austen's life is in some way reflected in the novel. In a letter dated Saturday (9 January 1796), Austen mentioned: > You scold me so much in the nice long letter which I have this moment > received from you, that I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend > and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking > in the way of dancing and sitting down together. I can expose myself > however, only once more, because he leaves the country soon after next > Friday, on which day we are to have a dance at Ashe after all. He is a very > gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man, I assure you. But as to our > having ever met, except at the three last balls, I cannot say much; for he > is so excessively laughed at about me at Ashe, that he is ashamed of coming > to Steventon, and ran away when we called on Mrs. Lefroy a few days ago. > . . . > After I had written the above, we received a visit from Mr. Tom Lefroy and > his cousin George. The latter is really very well-behaved now; and as for > the other, he has but one fault, which time will, I trust, entirely remove — > it is that his morning coat is a great deal too light. He is a very great > admirer of Tom Jones, and therefore wears the same coloured clothes, I > imagine, which he did when he was wounded. In a letter started on Thursday (14 January 1796), and finished the following morning, there was another mention of him. > Friday. — At length the day is come on which I am to flirt my last with Tom > Lefroy, and when you receive this it will be over. My tears flow as I write > at the melancholy idea. Austen's surviving correspondence contains only one other mention of Tom Lefroy, in a November 1798 letter that Austen biographer Claire Tomalin believes demonstrates the author's \\"bleak remembrance, and persistent interest\\"Tomalin, Claire. Jane Austen: A Life, Viking, London/Knopf, New York, 1997; Vintage Books, New York, 1999. 119 in Lefroy. In the letter to her sister, Austen writes that Tom's aunt Mrs. Lefroy had been to visit, but had not said anything about her nephew... > \\"...to me, and I was too proud to make any enquiries; but on my father's > afterwards asking where he was, I learnt that he was gone back to London in > his way to Ireland, where he is called to the Bar and means to practise.\\" Upon learning of Jane Austen's death (18 July 1817), Thomas Langlois Lefroy travelled from Ireland to England to pay his respects to the British author. In addition, at an auction of Cadell's papers (possibly in London), one Tom Lefroy bought a Cadell publisher's rejection letter—for Austen's early version of Pride and Prejudice, titled First Impressions. Caroline Austen said in her letter to James Edward Austen-Leigh on 1 April 1869: > I enclose a copy of Mr. Austen's letter to Cadell—I do not know which novel > he would have sent—The letter does not do much credit to the tact or > courtesy of our good Grandfather for Cadell was a great man in his day, and > it is not surprising that he should have refused the favour so offered from > an unknown—but the circumstance may be worth noting, especially as we have > so few incidents to produce. At a sale of Cadell's papers &c; Tom Lefroy > picked up the original letter—and Jemima copied it for me – It was rather unlikely that Caroline Austen would address the Chief Justice Lefroy as only 'Tom Lefroy' (she indeed addressed him as the still living 'Chief Justice' in the later part of the letter). However, if it is true that the original Tom Lefroy purchased the Cadell letter after Jane's death, it is possible that he later handed it over to Thomas Edward Preston Lefroy (T.E.P. Lefroy; husband of Jemima Lefroy who was the daughter of Anna Austen Lefroy and Benjamin Lefroy). T.E.P. Lefroy later would give Cadell's letter to Caroline for reference. Cadell & Davies firm was closed down in 1836 after the death of Thomas Cadell Jr. The sale of Cadell's papers took place in 1840, possibly in November. In the latter years of Tom Lefroy's life, he was questioned about his relationship with Jane Austen by his nephew, and admitted to having loved Jane Austen, but stated that it was a \\"boyish love\\".Spence, Jon. Becoming Jane Austen. Hambledon Continuum. London, 2003. As is written in a letter sent from T.E.P. Lefroy to James Edward Austen Leigh in 1870, > My late venerable uncle ... said in so many words that he was in love with > her, although he qualified his confession by saying it was a boyish love. As > this occurred in a friendly & private conversation, I feel some doubt > whether I ought to make it public. A fictitious account of their relationship is at the center of the 2007 historical romance film Becoming Jane. In this film, Lefroy is played by James McAvoy and Austen is played by Anne Hathaway. Political career Lefroy contested Dublin University in an 1827 by-election, as a Tory, but finished third. An idea of Lefroy's politics is given by the opening of an editorial in The Times (of London) on Friday 27 February 1829 when he was opposing the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, whose effect was to admit Irish Catholics to parliament (if they met a high property qualification). Lefroy may have been influenced by Huguenot family memories of persecution by French Catholics; this was the case with other opponents of Catholic emancipation such as William Saurin mentioned above. Richard Lalor Sheil published a profile of Lefroy stating (amongst many hostile remarks on his combination of piety and moneymaking) that Lefroy was well known for his interest in the conversion of Jews to Protestantism, leading Daniel O'Connell to joke during a lawsuit over a collection of antique coins that Lefroy should be given the Hebrew coins as his fee while O'Connell received those with a Roman inscription. Patrick Geoghegan's life of O'Connell, King Dan, states that O'Connell held Lefroy's legal abilities in contempt and regarded him as a prime example of a lawyer promoted above more meritorious Catholics (notably O'Connell himself) because of his Protestant religion and Tory politics. He was elected to the House of Commons for the Dublin University seat in 1830, as a Tory (the party later became known as Conservative). He became a member of the Privy Council of Ireland on 29 January 1835. In 1838, Thomas Langlois Lefroy received American politician Charles Sumner during Sumner's visit to Ireland.Pierce, E.L. 1970. Memoir and Letters of Charles Sumner. Ayer Publishing Tom Lefroy continued to represent the University until he was appointed an Irish judge (with the title of a Baron of the Exchequer) in 1841. In 1848 he presided over the sedition trial of the Young Irelander John Mitchel. He was promoted to Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench in Ireland in 1852. Despite some allegations in Parliament, that he was too old to do the job, Lefroy did not resign as Chief Justice until he was aged 90 and a Conservative government was in office to fill the vacancy. This was in July 1866. One apocryphal story (in the memoirs of the Home Rule MP JG Swift MacNeill) describes Lefroy's son as denying in Parliament that his father was too old to perform his duties, but being himself so visibly old and feeble as to produce the opposite effect on parliamentary opinion. Another version of this story has the son defending his father's capacity although he himself had applied to be excused certain official duties on account of advanced age. The Hansard report of the debate can be found here. In a satirical pamphlet on the Trinity College Dublin election of 1865 Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu suggests that Lefroy was so old that he had \\"ridden on the mastodon to hunt the megatherium\\" and mocks the manner in which the Conservative lawyer-politicians Joseph Napier and James Whiteside allegedly insisted whenever the Conservatives were in power (and might appoint them to replace him) that Lefroy is too old to perform his duties, only to insist whenever a Whig government is in power that he is in perfect health. Interest in astronomy Tom Lefroy was also interested in astronomy. On 30 March 1846, he visited William Parsons, the 3rd Earl of Rosse in Parsonstown to try Parsons's new telescope called Leviathan of Parsonstown. Tom later said to his wife (Letter 31 March 1846): : Family According to the website of (Tom Lefroy's house in Longford, Ireland), the Lefroy family came from the town of Cambrai in the northwestern corner of France. They were a Huguenot family, and one of their heads of the family, the Lord L'Offroy, died at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. =Tom Lefroy's siblings= Tom Lefroy was born of the Irish Lefroys, descendants of a Huguenot Lefroy who migrated to England in the 16th century, hence the French-sounding name (the family head being a Lord L'Offroy). In 1765, Tom's father (Anthony Peter Lefroy) was secretly married to Ann Gardner in Limerick (Ireland). Five girls were born without Benjamin Langlois (Tom's great uncle and his family's benefactor) knowing it (Radovici mentioned five, but Cranfield mentioned four; it is possible that one of Tom's elder sisters died in infancy). Thomas Langlois Lefroy was the sixth child, also the first son. The list of Tom's siblings (including him) is as follows:Cranfield, R.

Tom Lefroy's daughters never married. Jane Christmas Lefroy Tom Lefroy's first daughter was named Jane Christmas Lefroy. Scholars debate the derivation of this name. Some believe that the name Jane was derived from Lady Jane Paul (Tom's mother-in-law). Others believe the name referred to Jane Austen.Radovici, N. 1995, A Youthful Love: Jane Austen and Tom Lefroy?, Merlin Books Devon. The second theory is implied in the 2007 film Becoming Jane. Christmas was a family name coming from the Paul family Carrigglas Manor Carrigglas Manor House, 2001 Carrigglas Manor was a Gothic-style great house built for Lefroy and his family circa 1830 (Memoir of Chief Justice Lefroy). The family had lived in Carrigglas before 1837 (one of Tom's letter for Mary was dated 5 October 1834). James Gandon the famous architect of Dublin's Custom House designed and built a stable block and farmyard and walled garden for Lefroy. In 1837, Lefroy renovated the Manor with the help of Daniel Robertson, Esq., a famous English architect. A hurricane on 6 January 1839 destroyed some parts of the house, and Lefroy had to rebuild it. The Lefroy family sold the Manor and Estate in 2006. , the plan to adapt the manor house to be part of a newly built hotel, and to turn the park into a golf course and housing estate collapsed and work at Carrigglas was terminated before the hotel or any of the new houses were occupied.Carrigglas Manor In 2014, the estate was bought by the Longford family and company Glennon's who are the current owners.

The film was financially successful in the UK, but performed disappointingly in the US. The only film made during a brief contract dispute with Universal Studios, The Ghoul also marked the first time in over two decades that Karloff had acted in Britain and the British film industry.https://www.classicfilmfreak.com/2015/01/22/ghoul-1933-boris-karloff/ accessed 12 March 2019 Subsequently, the film disappeared and was considered to be a lost film. In 1969, collector William K. Everson located a murky, virtually inaudible subtitled copy, Běs, in then-communist Czechoslovakia. Though missing eight minutes of footage including two violent murder scenes, it was thought to be the only surviving copy of the film. Everson had a 16mm copy made and for years made it available to film societies in England and the United States, including a screening at The New School in New York City in 1975 on a Halloween triple bill with Lon Chaney in The Monster and Bela Lugosi in The Gorilla. Subsequently, The Museum of Modern Art and Janus Film made an archival negative of the Prague print and it went into very limited commercial distribution. In the early 1980s a disused and forgotten film vault at Shepperton Studios, its door blocked by stacked lumber, was cleared and yielded the nitrate camera negative of the film in perfect condition. The British Film Institute took possession of the film, new prints were made, and the complete version aired on Channel 4 in the UK. However, the official VHS release from MGM/UA Home Video was of the mutilated Czech copy.

They differ greatly from true toads (those of the family Bufonidae) by having eyes with vertical pupils, no parotoid gland, and relatively smooth skin. Their most distinctive feature is a spade-like projection on their hind feet, from which their common name is derived. This projection enables spadefoot toads to dig in loose soils with ease. Its scientific names means ‘spade-foot’ as well, from the Ancient Greek ' (, ‘spade, shovel’) and ' (, ‘foot, leg’).  Species  Scaphiopus species were once classified with their European cousins in the family Pelobatidae, but have since been reclassified to their own family, Scaphiopodidae with other North American species. There are three species in the genus Scaphiopus: *Couch's spadefoot, Scaphiopus couchii Baird, 1854 *Eastern spadefoot, Scaphiopus holbrookii (Harlan, 1835) *Hurter's spadefoot, Scaphiopus hurterii , 1910  Geographic range  Spadefoot toads are found throughout the United States and into northern Mexico. They tend to prefer dry, grassland areas with loose, sandy soils that flood in the rainy season.  Description  Scaphiopus are generally colored appropriately with greens and browns to camouflage themselves in their native habitat. At adult size they are usually not much larger than 8 cm. Rear foot of a Couch's spadefoot, Scaphiopus couchii demonstrating the \\"spade\\" that gives them their name  Behaviour, diet, and reproduction  Spadefoot toads are nocturnal and are rarely seen when it hasn't rained recently. They spend most of the time during the dry season buried in the ground in aestivation. When it rains, they emerge to feed on invertebrates and to breed in vernal pools. They have one of the fastest reproductive cycles of any amphibian species. Once laid, eggs hatch in a matter of a day or two. The tadpoles are capable of developing to froglets within a couple of weeks. This feature is primarily due to fact that most of their breeding areas dry quickly once the rainy season is over.

This species and Pantala hymenaea, the \\"spot-winged glider\\", are the only members of the genus Pantala. It was first described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1798. It is considered to be the most widespread dragonfly on the planet with good population on every continent except Antarctica although rare in Europe. Globe skimmers make an annual multigenerational journey of some 18,000 km (about 11,200 miles); to complete the migration, individual globe skimmers fly more than 6,000 km (3,730 miles)—one of the farthest known migrations of all insect species. Characteristics =Structure of the adult= The dragonfly is up to 4.5 cm long, reaching wingspans between 7.2 cm and 8.4 cm. The front side of the head is yellowish to reddish. The thorax is usually yellow to golden coloured with a dark and hairy line. There were also specimens with a brown or olive thorax. The abdomen has a similar colour as the thorax. The wings are clear and very broad at the base. There, too, there are some specimens with olive, brown and yellow wings. On Easter Island there are wandering gliders with black wings. The pterostigma turns yellowish. The transparent wings may turn a yellowish shade towards the tip. The chestnut-red eyes take up most of the head, as is usual in the large dragonflies (Anisoptera). The above colours explain the many scientific descriptions of this species under different names. Females show some differences compared with males. The general rule is, the males have reddish yellow abdomen marked with black whereas the females lack the reddish wash in abdomen. The males have golden yellow patch on base of hindwings and narrow apical brown spot at the hind border of wings. The females lack apical brown patches in wings. In mainland males, the length of the femur, the longest leg section, varies; they also have longer front and shorter hindwings than the females. The island representatives, however, have the front and hindwings longer than the female, and the femur is the same for both sexes. There are other differences between mainland and island specimens, particularly in terms of colouring. Island representatives are generally darker. =Structure of the larva= Exuviae The larva is between 24 and 26 mm long. It is light green with light, brown speckles. The round eyes are sideways on the bottom of the head, the abdomen and the tail blunt. The paired side plates on the eleventh segment of the abdomen, the so-called paraproct, is smooth when seen from the side. The unpaired dorsal plate of the eleventh segment, called the epiproct, is roughly the same length as or longer than the paraproct. This distinguishes them from larvae of the genus Tramea, where the epiproct is shorter than the paraproct. Furthermore, the mouth parts (palpus) have 12–14 bristles and thus fewer than P. hymenaea which has 15–18 bristles. =Similar species= Pantala hymenaea; note the brown basal fleck in the hindwing Pantala flavescens may be confused with the P. hymenaea, the \\"spot- winged glider\\", but this has a striking brown basal fleck in the hindwing and is generally slightly darker in colour. It might be taken for a member of the genus Tramea but these usually have a distinctive stripe on their hindwings. Life cycle =Reproduction and development= Mating in Bhuvanagiri, Telangana As is usual in the Libellulidae family, there is no distinct courtship ritual. The females may pair many times, but usually only once a day. After mating, the migrant dragonflies fly in tandem, with the female ovipositing while the male remains connected. A clutch consists of about 500 to 2000 eggs. The eggs are spheroid in shape with the semi-major axis 0.5 mm and 0.4 mm at the smallest points. The larvae develop within 38 to 65 days, which allows this migrant dragonfly to reproduce in temporary waters or even in swimming pools. However, the larvae seem to be very sensitive to temperature. The life expectancy is not known and because of their high mobility it is almost impossible to determine. =Food= The larvae of the globe skimmer, like all dragonflies, are predatory. It forages very actively and eats fairly indiscriminately all sorts of aquatic invertebrates, such as aquatic insect larvae and small shrimps (Peracarida). Even tadpoles and small fish are used for food. The imago eats mostly small insects such as mosquitoes, swarming flying ants, and termites. =Flight behaviour= Pantala flavescens wandering behaviour They are very conspicuous dragonflies; seen in swarms over paddy fields, playgrounds or open areas. They fly tirelessly with typical wandering flight for hours without making any perch. Their flight speed is up to 5 m/s. Especially in the autumn, the wandering glider flies in large swarms, using thermals to advantage. One report even speaks of a \\"cloud\\" covering 34 km2. They prefer moist winds. In normal flight, island populations keep to 2.5 meters above the ground and stop flying in thermal updraughts. The continental populations fly at altitudes of three to four meters, and do not stop flying even in bad weather. Those on Easter Island have adapted away from their migratory habits because to fly out to the open sea would usually mean certain death. When landing, it seeks a vertical attitude. Like all large dragonflies, the wings are held out from the body at rest. =Distribution and flight= An aggregation of dragonflies during migration The globe skimmer, as its name suggests, has a very wide distribution area, between about the 40th parallels of latitude or within the 20 °C isotherm (areas of the world where the annual mean temperature is above 20 degrees Celsius), and up to about the 50th parallel north in North America. In Europe there are only occasional sightings of the species, with credible evidence to date mainly from the Aegean Sea and the adjacent mainland. Globe skimmer records from England or France are doubtful and may arise from co-importation with shipments of bananas. An explanation for the scarcity in Europe of this otherwise common species is the barrier effect of the Sahara which generates unfavourable winds, such as the Sirocco, whose dryness makes dragonfly passage almost impossible. Their arrival in the subtropics and tropics coincides with the Intertropical Convergence Zone. More evidence of their preference for moist winds is that the dragonfly migrates to Southeast India's Tamil Nadu only after the second monsoon, which brings the rain to that region. In the rest of India, however, it arrives with the first rain-making monsoon. Observations and stable isotope evidence suggests that they migrate from India or beyond to Africa across the Arabian Sea. It is the highest-flying dragonfly, recorded at in the Himalayas. It was also first dragonfly species that settled on Bikini Atoll after the nuclear tests there. Furthermore, it is the only Odonata on Easter Island. These individuals seem to be a small gene pool, derived from the continental populations, which is slowly creating a new type by genetic drift. In colder areas like South Australia and Southern Canada, the species cannot overwinter and must therefore be replaced by new migrants each year. According to recent research carried out by biologists at Rutgers University- Newark this species of dragonfly is the world's longest known distance insect traveller. Genetic evidence taken from dragonflies across the globe suggests that these small size insects are travelling vast distances to mate and are thus creating a worldwide gene pool. Another study concluded that Pantala flavescens is a near global panmictic population. Naming =Common name= The English common names \\"wandering glider\\" and \\"globe skimmer\\" refer to its migratory behaviour. The German name Wanderlibelle means \\"migrant dragonfly\\". In Hong Kong, its name translates as \\"typhoon dragonfly\\" as it arrives with or shortly before the seasonal rain. The Japanese name is which is translated as \\"yellow dragonfly with delicate wings\\". Similarly, the South Korean name is '된장잠자리'(translated as \\"doenjang dragonfly\\") because its colour is similar to doenjang, the Korean bean paste. =Scientific name= In the scientific name Pantala flavescens, the genus name Pantala means \\"all wings\\", alluding to the big and long wings. The specific name comes from the Latin flavescens, meaning \\"yellowish\\", and refers to its distinctive golden tint. The species was first described in 1798 as Libellula flavescens by Fabricius as follows: The first description of this underlying holotype is in the Zoological Museum of Copenhagen University taken from a female collected from India. In following years there appeared more descriptions with different names. In 1805, Palisot de Beauvois designated a specimen from Nigeria as Libellula viridula. Around 1823 the British entomologist Dale, in an unpublished manuscript, described an allegedly Norfolk-trapped male as Libellula sparing halli, It is now in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. In 1839, the German entomologist Burmeister named a male collected in Madras as Libellula analis (now in the Zoological Collection of the University of Halle-Wittenberg) and another male from Brazil as Libellula terminalis (now in the Natural History Museum of Vienna.) In 1910, the field was cleared as Richard Anthony Muttkowski recognized that these species were all synonyms. A description made of Sympetrum tandicola (Singh) 1955 from a male collected in the Himalayas and deposited at the Zoological Survey India, Calcutta, was identified as belonging to Pantala flavescens in 1973. Protection status The globe skimmer has NatureServe conservation status G5, meaning it is secure (common, widespread and abundant) worldwide. This status was awarded on 1985. In the United States, it has the national equivalent protection status N5. In Canada, however, it is lower with N4 meaning it is apparently secure – uncommon but not rare but with some cause for long-term concern. Even at this level, it is granted protected status in many states of the US and Canada. Postage stamps Due to its wide distribution, the globe skimmer appears on a number of stamps. On 29 July 1974 Wallis and Futuna published a 45 franc with a dragonfly over a water surface with some plants showing. It has Michel catalog number 257 appearing in a set of insect motifs. On 1975. The Pitcairn Islands published a 15 cent with a dragonfly flying on a dark blue background. Its Miche number is 154, and it also appeared in an insect collection. Tuvalu brought out a 10 cent on 1983 which shows a globe skimmer. The lithographic illustration was designed by J E Cooter. Its Michel number is 190, and it appeared in a set of dragonflies. The representation was limited to the dragonfly with grasses. Botswana published a six-thebe stamp showing the front of a blue dragonfly on a green background. Wallis and Futuna published another stamp on 1998, a 36F with the dragonfly shown flying on a yellowish background. It has Michel number 736 and appeared together with other insect motifs. The latest stamp comes from 2003 and appeared in North Korea. Its value is 15 wŏn and it represents a sedentary globe skimmer on a spike.

History Animaland Park Animaland Park, a collection of concrete sculptures of animals that was once a roadside attraction, is located near Penobsquis. In 2018, the land where the park sits was opened as a campground. The statues remain as a feature of the new campground.  Water supply  Penobsquis is the site of a large potash deposit which is mined by the New Brunswick division of the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (PCS). The company announced expansion plans in 2007 which will see a second mine open within several years. The community also hosts several natural gas wells known as the McCully Field. The wells are being developed by Corridor Resources Inc., some in partnership with PotashCorp. Penobsquis is also the proposed site of an Eco-Industrial Business Park to be known as Fundy Green Park.Fundy Green Park Co-operative Ltd. More than 50 homes in the Penobsquis area lost their well water over a number of years. Many blame this problem on the water that is flowing in the Potash Mine as the mine has had water inflow at rates up to 1,800 gallons per minute. The loss of water is also alleged to be the fault of 3-D and 2-D seismic testing done by PCS and Corridor Resources, although the cause has never been conclusively shown. More than a dozen households have complained to the New Brunswick Mining Commissioner for damage from the loss of water and mining subsidence. Drinking water was delivered to homes affected by dry wells by PCS, and non- potable water by the province of New Brunswick. Many residents allege that the provincially delivered water is a cause of rashes and other health problems. Other residents blame the rashes and lung problems on the natural gas flares. Neither of these allegations have been proven. A new water system was put in by the province with federal gas tax funds, residents are now forced to pay for water. In October 2018, a press release by PotashCorp New Brunswick announced the closure of the Penobsquis potash mine at the end of November 2018.

Biography Goldflam received his education in his native city of Warsaw. He graduated from secondary school in 1869, then studied medicine at Warsaw University. He qualified as a physician in 1875, then worked in internal medicine at Holy Ghost Hospital under Professor Wilhelm Dusan Lambl (1824-95), known for the giardia parasite, Lamblia intestinalis. Lambl was not much of a mentor, so Goldflam worked largely by himself. His position at the internal-medicine clinic supplied him with ample research material. At that time, both internal-medicine and neurology patients were seen at Lambl’s clinic. In 1882 Goldflam studied with the famous neurologists Karl Friedrich Otto Westphal (1833-90) and Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-93), then returned to Warsaw to teach neurology in the manner of the great masters. After a new period in Lambl’s clinic at Holy Ghost Hospital, he established his own clinic at Graniczna Street, no. 10, in Warsaw, for underprivileged patients, which he ran for nearly 40 years. During World War I, Goldflam worked as a volunteer in the Jewish Hospital with his great friend, the neurologist, Edward Flatau (1869-1932). During the war he was one of the first to notice a correspondence between malnourishment and diseases, and he documented a bone and joint disease under the name osteoarthropathia dysalimentaria (1918). His main interest, however, was in the significance of reflexes, the neurological aspects of syphilis, and eye reflexes. Samuel Goldflam Goldflam was a sharp clinician with the ability to recognize small clues of illness which often escaped the attention of his colleagues. He not only worked with patients but was a pathologist. His profound observations and publications were recognized in Poland and abroad. Goldflam established the Jewish Society for Mental Disorders and established the „Sophia” clinic for mental patients in Otwock, as well as the Berson and Bauman Children’s Hospital in Warsaw. Together with Flatau he established the Pathology Scientific Institute and the medical periodical Warszawskie Czasopismo Naukowe. Goldflam was a full member of the Warsaw Scientific Society (Towarzystwo Naukowe Warszawskie). Together with Janusz Korczak and Gerszon Lewin, he helped many social causes. A genius in neurology, Goldflam was also an artist and an expert on Beethoven, and he helped many aspiring artists, including Artur Rubinstein, to establish their careers. He died in 1932, the same year as two other great Polish neurologists, Edward Flatau and Joseph Babiński. References  Sources  * E.J.

Found in honey bee colonies, these most unusual wingless and small flies, are not a true bee parasite, and are barely recognizable as Diptera, as they have the superficial appearance of mites or lice. History The first discovery of Braulidae was of Braula coeca, in 1818 by Christian Ludwig Nitzch, a German zoologist. In 1986, the genus Megabraula was discovered by David Grimaldi, an American entomologist. Braulidae are found throughout the world in Africa, Europe, Australia, North America, and South America. Since they prefer queen bees as hosts, they are thought to have been brought to the United States by queen importation. Many species of Braulidae are thought to have different host honey bee races. Some of these include B. Kohli and B.pretoriensis which are restricted to Carniolan and middle eastern honey bee races and B.schmitzi with the Italian race. B. coeca is the most widely known Braulidae species, most commonly seen on honey bees around the world. Life cycle =Adults= The adult Braulidae life- cycle is intimately connected with that of honey bees. The adults roam around on adult honey bees, feeding on their mouth secretions. Although they do not harm the bees, they may be a major nuisance to them in certain areas. As adults, they will eat honey and when available, preferring royal jelly. The adults are nimble and scramble for food being fed to the queen. When present, Braulidae are most likely found in bee hives, and at times on flowers waiting for bees to hang onto. Once the adults become mature, their eggs are laid on honey bee wax cappings. Size of Braulidae may vary. Braula will be about 1.6mm and the Megabraula will be about 3mm. They have reduced eyes located just above the antennae, their antennae are hidden in grooves, and their legs are short and robust. Unlike most flies, they lack wings or halteres. They are reddish-brown in color, have a 5-segmented tarsus, and their thorax is only half as long as their head. They also lack a distinct scutellum on the metathorax.. =Larvae / immatures= The larvae of Braulidae are maggot-like with a flattened posterior end and pointed anterior end. They tunnel through wax and comb feeding on the wax and pollen. Because they are in the suborder Schizophora, they emerge from the puparium through the use of the ptilinum, an eversible sack on the front of the head that inflates to burst a circular exit from the end of the puparium. Behavior Although Braulidae may be seen on adult honey bees, they are most commonly seen on queen bees. Several (up to 30 reported) can be found on a queen bee at one time, whereas there may only be one or two at most on worker honey bees. Phylogeny Since its discovery, the phylogenetic placement of Braulidae has been uncertain. Up until the 20th century, because of its unique characteristics, scientists were unaware of its placement. Since very little is known about Braulidae, the species Braula coeca has been the most studied. *1818 Nitzsch thought it was pupiparous (young that have already reached the pupal state upon hatching). *1858 Leukart thought they were oviparous (young hatching from an egg), instead of ovoviviparous (eggs hatching within the mother's body, then emerging as live young). *1900s they were thought to have been with Phoridae. *1917 Hermann Schmitz noted a well-developed ptilinal fissure, making it an acalyptrate cyclorrhaphan (Schizophora) *1972 Willi Hennig, after much speculation, agreed with Schmitz and placed the Braulidae near the family Sphaeroceridae (Muscoidea & Anthomyzoinea) *1982 Hackman & Vaisanen did not include Braulidae within their fly classification. *2011 Wiegmann, et al. placed Braulidae within superfamily Ephydroidea, as the sister group to Drosophilidae.

The melanocortins exert their effects by binding to and activating the melanocortin receptors. There are 5 melanocortin receptors (MCR) and all of them are G protein–coupled receptors. In the brain, only MC3R and MC4R are expressed and their endogenous ligand is α-MSH. Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) is the endogenous antagonist.  Function  The melanocortin system is one of the mammalian body's tools to regulate food intake in a push- pull fashion. The only neurons known to release melanocortins are located in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalmus. Accordingly, there is a subpopulation called POMC neurons and one called AgRP neurons. When POMC neurons release α-MSH, appetite is decreased. On the other hand, when AgRP neurons release AgRP, appetite is stimulated. Leptin, the energy surfeit hormone, and Ghrelin, the hunger hormone, are upstream regulators of the melanocortin system in the brain. These hormones also regulate the release of peptides other than the melanocortins.

According to eternal inflation, the inflationary phase of the universe's expansion lasts forever throughout most of the universe. Because the regions expand exponentially rapidly, most of the volume of the universe at any given time is inflating. Eternal inflation, therefore, produces a hypothetically infinite multiverse, in which only an insignificant fractal volume ends inflation. Paul Steinhardt, one of the original architects of the inflationary model, introduced the first example of eternal inflation in 1983, and Alexander Vilenkin showed that it is generic. Alan Guth's 2007 paper, \\"Eternal inflation and its implications\\", states that under reasonable assumptions \\"Although inflation is generically eternal into the future, it is not eternal into the past.\\" Guth detailed what was known about the subject at the time, and demonstrated that eternal inflation was still considered the likely outcome of inflation, more than 20 years after eternal inflation was first introduced by Steinhardt. Overview =Development of the theory= Inflation, or the inflationary universe theory, was originally developed as a way to overcome the few remaining problems with what was otherwise considered a successful theory of cosmology, the Big Bang model. In 1979, Alan Guth introduced the inflationary model of the universe to explain why the universe is flat and homogeneous (which refers to the smooth distribution of matter and radiation on a large scale). The basic idea was that the universe underwent a period of rapidly accelerating expansion a few instants after the Big Bang. He offered a mechanism for causing the inflation to begin: false vacuum energy. Guth coined the term \\"inflation,\\" and was the first to discuss the theory with other scientists worldwide. Guth's original formulation was problematic, as there was no consistent way to bring an end to the inflationary epoch and end up with the hot, isotropic, homogeneous universe observed today. Although the false vacuum could decay into empty \\"bubbles\\" of \\"true vacuum\\" that expanded at the speed of light, the empty bubbles could not coalesce to reheat the universe, because they could not keep up with the remaining inflating universe. In 1982, this \\"graceful exit problem\\" was solved independently by Andrei Linde and by Andreas Albrecht and Paul J. Steinhardt who showed how to end inflation without making empty bubbles and, instead, end up with a hot expanding universe. The basic idea was to have a continuous \\"slow-roll\\" or slow evolution from false vacuum to true without making any bubbles. The improved model was called \\"new inflation.\\" In 1983, Paul Steinhardt was the first to show that this \\"new inflation\\" does not have to end everywhere. Instead, it might only end in a finite patch or a hot bubble full of matter and radiation, and that inflation continues in most of the universe while producing hot bubble after hot bubble along the way. Alexander Vilenkin showed that when quantum effects are properly included, this is actually generic to all new inflation models. Using ideas introduced by Steinhardt and Vilenkin, Andrei Linde published an alternative model of inflation in 1986 which used these ideas to provide a detailed description of what has become known as the Chaotic Inflation theory or eternal inflation. =Quantum fluctuations= New inflation does not produce a perfectly symmetric universe due to quantum fluctuations during inflation. The fluctuations cause the energy and matter density to be different in different points in space. Quantum fluctuations in the hypothetical inflation field produce changes in the rate of expansion that are responsible for eternal inflation. Those regions with a higher rate of inflation expand faster and dominate the universe, despite the natural tendency of inflation to end in other regions. This allows inflation to continue forever, to produce future-eternal inflation. As a simplified example, suppose that during inflation, the natural decay rate of the inflaton field is slow compared to the effect of quantum fluctuation. When a mini- universe inflates and \\"self-reproduces\\" into, say, twenty causally- disconnected mini-universes of equal size to the original mini-universe, perhaps nine of the new mini-universes will have a larger, rather than smaller, average inflaton field value than the original mini-universe, because they inflated from regions of the original mini-universe where quantum fluctuation pushed the inflaton value up more than the slow inflation decay rate brought the inflaton value down. Originally there was one mini-universe with a given inflaton value; now there are nine mini-universes that have a slightly larger inflaton value. (Of course, there are also eleven mini- universes where the inflaton value is slightly lower than it originally was.) Each mini-universe with the larger inflaton field value restarts a similar round of approximate self-reproduction within itself. (The mini-universes with lower inflaton values may also reproduce, unless its inflaton value is small enough that the region drops out of inflation and ceases self-reproduction.) This process continues indefinitely; nine high-inflaton mini-universes might become 81, then 729... Thus, there is eternal inflation.Linde, Andrei. \\"Inflationary cosmology.\\" Inflationary cosmology. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2008. 1-54. In 1980, quantum fluctuations were suggested by Viatcheslav Mukhanov and Gennady Chibisov in the Soviet Union in the context of a model of modified gravity by Alexei Starobinsky to be possible seeds for forming galaxies. In the context of inflation, quantum fluctuations were first analyzed at the three-week 1982 Nuffield Workshop on the Very Early Universe at Cambridge University.See Guth (1997) for a popular description of the workshop, or The Very Early Universe, eds Hawking, Gibbon & Siklos for a more detailed report The average strength of the fluctuations was first calculated by four groups working separately over the course of the workshop: Stephen Hawking; Starobinsky; Guth and So-Young Pi; and James M. Bardeen, Paul Steinhardt and Michael Turner. The early calculations derived at the Nuffield Workshop only focused on the average fluctuations, whose magnitude is too small to affect inflation. However, beginning with the examples presented by Steinhardt and Vilenkin, the same quantum physics was later shown to produce occasional large fluctuations that increase the rate of inflation and keep inflation going eternally. =Further developments= In analyzing the Planck Satellite data from 2013, Anna Ijjas and Paul Steinhardt showed that the simplest textbook inflationary models were eliminated and that the remaining models require exponentially more tuned starting conditions, more parameters to be adjusted, and less inflation. Later Planck observations reported in 2015 confirmed these conclusions. A 2014 paper by Kohli and Haslam called into question the viability of the eternal inflation theory, by analyzing Linde's chaotic inflation theory in which the quantum fluctuations are modeled as Gaussian white noise. They showed that in this popular scenario, eternal inflation in fact cannot be eternal, and the random noise leads to spacetime being filled with singularities. This was demonstrated by showing that solutions to the Einstein field equations diverge in a finite time. Their paper therefore concluded that the theory of eternal inflation based on random quantum fluctuations would not be a viable theory, and the resulting existence of a multiverse is \\"still very much an open question that will require much deeper investigation\\". Inflation, eternal inflation, and the multiverse In 1983, it was shown that inflation could be eternal, leading to a multiverse in which space is broken up into bubbles or patches whose properties differ from patch to patch spanning all physical possibilities. Paul Steinhardt, who produced the first example of eternal inflation, eventually became a strong and vocal opponent of the theory. He argued that the multiverse represented a breakdown of the inflationary theory, because, in a multiverse, any outcome is equally possible, so inflation makes no predictions and, hence, is untestable. Consequently, he argued, inflation fails a key condition for a scientific theory.http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~steinh/vaasrev.pdf Both Linde and Guth, however, continued to support the inflationary theory and the multiverse. Guth declared: According to Linde, \\"It's possible to invent models of inflation that do not allow a multiverse, but it's difficult. Every experiment that brings better credence to inflationary theory brings us much closer to hints that the multiverse is real.\\" In 2018 the late Stephen Hawking and Thomas Hertog published a paper in which the need for an infinite multiverse vanishes as Hawking describes their theory gives universes which are \\"reasonably smooth and globally finite\\". The theory uses the holographic principle to define an 'exit plane' from the timeless state of eternal inflation, the universes which are generated on the plane are described using a redefinition of the no-boundary wavefunction, in fact the theory requires a boundary at the beginning of time. Stated simply Hawking says that their findings \\"imply a significant reduction of the multiverse\\" which as the University of Cambridge points out, makes the theory \\"predictive and testable\\" using gravitational wave astronomy.

Although the unconscious person did not request the doctor's services, the courts have deemed it reasonable for the doctor to presume that such services would be desired by the person, had they been conscious. Another exception to this rule, in certain jurisdictions, is the existence of a quasi-contract. In general, in order for a contract to exist, there must be mutual consent among all parties.Contracts LII / Legal Information Institute In the case of an officious intermeddler, this element of a contract is missing: consideration (goods or services) was provided by one party, but without the mutual consent of the receiving party. Therefore, no contract was made, and the intermeddler has no legal recourse to claim compensation. However, certain legal jurisdictions provide for an implied-by- law contract, called a quasi-contract, that exists solely for the purposes of remedying this unjust enrichment by giving a court legal means to enforce compensation. The distinction between an officious intermeddler, and a party operating under a quasi-contract, is that the recipient of the goods or services has knowingly accepted the goods or services, with the intention of benefiting from them without providing compensation.http://law.jrank.org/pages/9603/Quasi-Contract.html Quasi Contract  References  = Citations = = Sources = * Second Restatement of Contracts Sec. 74 * Restatement of Restitution Sec. 2 * Restatement of Restitution Sec. 116 * Black's Law Dictionary  See also  * Quasi-contract Common law Contract law Contract law legal terminology ","title":"Officious intermeddler"},{"id":"4006171","text":"Into the Void may refer to: *Into the Void (video game), a 1997 strategy game *\\"Into the Void\\" (Black Sabbath song), 1971 *\\"Into the Void\\" (Nine Inch Nails song), 1999 *\\"Into the Void\\" (Kiss song), 1998 * Into the Void, a 1991 Spelljammer novel by Nigel Findley *\\"Into the Void\\" (The Flash), an episode of The Flash  See also  *Enter the Void, a 2009 film ","title":"Into the Void"},{"id":"4006178","text":"Nannophya pygmaea, known variously as the scarlet dwarf, northern pygmyfly, or tiny dragonfly, is a dragonfly of the family Libellulidae, native from Southeast Asia to China and Japan, occasionally found south to Australia.

According to Kant, the Solar System is merely a smaller version of the fixed star systems, such as the Milky Way and other galaxies. The cosmogony that Kant proposes is closer to today's accepted ideas than that of some of his contemporary thinkers such as Pierre-Simon Laplace. Moreover, Kant's thought in this volume is strongly influenced by atomist theory, in addition to the ideas of Lucretius. Background Kant answered to the call of the Berlin Academy Prize in 1754 Manfred Kühn, Kant - A Biography, CUP, 2002), p. 98: \\"[The essay] entitled \\"Investigation of the Question whether the Earth Has Experienced a Change in Its Rotation\\" [...] was meant to answer a question formulated for a public competition by the Berlin Academy. Though the deadline was at first 1754, the Academy extended it on June 6, 1754, for another two years. When Kant decided to publish this essay, he did not know of the extension. Kant claimed that he could not have achieved the kind of perfection required for winning the prize because he restricted himself to the \\"physical aspect\\" of the question.\\" with the argument that the Moon's gravity would eventually cause its tidal locking to coincide with the Earth's rotation. The next year, he expanded this reasoning to the formation and evolution of the Solar System in the Universal Natural History. Within the work Kant quotes Pierre Louis Maupertuis, who discusses six bright celestial objects listed by Edmond Halley, including Andromeda. Most of these are nebulae, but Maupertuis notes that about one-fourth of them are collections of stars—accompanied by white glows which they would be unable to cause on their own. Halley points to light created before the birth of the Sun, while William Derham \\"compares them to openings through which shines another immeasurable region and perhaps the fire of heaven.\\" He also observed that the collections of stars were much more distant than stars observed around them. Johannes Hevelius noted that the bright spots were massive and were flattened by a rotating motion; they are in fact galaxies. Contents Kant's book ends with an almost mystical expression of appreciation for nature: \\"In the universal silence of nature and in the calm of the senses the immortal spirit’s hidden faculty of knowledge speaks an ineffable language and gives [us] undeveloped concepts, which are indeed felt, but do not let themselves be described.\\"Immanuel Kant, Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens, p.367; translated by Stephen Palmquist in Kant's Critical Religion (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2000), p.320.

She was the first Australian gymnast to qualify for an individual event final at the Olympics. She has toured with Cirque du Soleil performing aerial hoops. Gymnastic Career Skinner began gymnastics in 1987 at Lawnton Academy. Between 1995 and 2004, she was a consistent presence on the Australian team, competing at four World Championships, three Olympic Games and many other international meets. She was the Australian national champion in 1996 and 1997. Skinner made her senior international debut at the 1995 World Championships in Sabae, placing 12th with the Australian team. The next year, at the 1996 Summer Olympics, she helped Australia place 10th in the team finals and finished 36th in the individual all-around. In the following years, Skinner's international performance improved dramatically. She earned two gold medals at the 1998 Commonwealth Games: one with the Australian team, the other as an individual on the uneven bars. At the 1999 World Championships, she placed 15th in the all-around. At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Skinner was the highest- ranked Australian female gymnast. At one point in the all-around competition, she was in third place. However, her vault had a low start value, and she therefore did not score high enough to win a medal. She eventually finished in 8th place, the highest placement ever for an Australian gymnast. In the floor exercise final, she had another chance to earn a medal, but ended up in 8th place after a fall. Her appearance was still notable, because it was the first time that an Australian gymnast had qualified to an Olympic event final. The score she received for the same routine in the all-around, a 9.75, would have been enough for a bronze medal in the final. After the 2000 Olympics, Skinner retired, but in 2002 she decided to resume training. She returned to competition in 2003, representing Australia at the 2003 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, the 2004 Pacific Alliance Championships, and the 2004 Summer Olympics. At her third Olympics, Skinner was an uneven bars and balance beam specialist. As a gymnast, Skinner was known for her expressive, balletic presentation and clean lines. She was a floor exercise specialist for many years, displaying routines with unique choreography and music. She also designed several leotards worn by the Australian national team at major competitions. Following the 2004 Olympics, Skinner retired again.

Senario) was a private non-profit college located in Ladysmith, Wisconsin, in the Diocese of Superior. History =Early history= The College began in 1930, when summer extension courses were conducted in Ladysmith for the Servants of Mary (Servite Sisters) by Eau Claire State Teachers College (now University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire). In 1952, courses were expanded to a junior college affiliated with the College of St. Scholastica. Ten years later, the Servants of Mary established Mount Senario College as a four-year college. Enrollment was open to the public and emphasis was placed on teacher training. The college was named after Monte Senario, the birthplace of the Servite Order, near Florence, Italy. In 1963, it received approval for certification of elementary teachers by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction; approval for secondary certification was received in 1965. Mount Senario College became a non-sectarian institution in 1972, when a plan for the reorganization of the school was adopted by the board of trustees and approved by the Servants of Mary. The college was granted academic accreditation by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1975. Mount Senario had 28 satellite locations serving students mostly in the areas of criminal justice, public administration, business administration and liberal arts. ;Main campus The main campus consisted of two major buildings. The largest was the college, consisting of college administration, library, bookstore, cafeteria, lecture hall, several classrooms, chemistry laboratory, biology laboratory and physics laboratory. Adjacent to the college building was the dormitory. ;Fine arts campus The fine arts campus was located a half mile east of the main campus, on the corner of Wisconsin Highway 27 and College Avenue, and consisted of one building. It had originally been erected in 1959 for Our Lady of Sorrows High School, which eventually became Servite High. When that facility closed in 1967, the building became the Fine Arts Center for Mount Senario College. This building housed MSC's music and art programs. The college used the gymnasium as a multi-functional space for basketball games, concerts and other large public gatherings. =Later history= Mount Senario closed on August 31, 2002 as a result of financial trouble. The college had been in poor financial health that was exacerbated by mismanagement and corruption involving school president Norman Stewart that ultimately led to the school's closing. The city of Ladysmith offered some financial assistance (purchasing the athletic fields); however, it was not enough to save \\"The Mount\\". Official student transcripts became the responsibility of the State of Wisconsin Educational Approval Board in August 2003 by court action. The transcript responsibility was transferred in December 2005 to The Wisconsin Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. =Since closing= For the 2006–07 school year, part of the former campus was operated as Concordia Preparatory School, a private Christian preparatory school. That institution also faced financial problems and closed midseason. Silver Lake College of Manitowoc, Wisconsin began offering courses at Mount Senario, renamed \\"Mount Senario Education Center\\", beginning September, 2009.Silver Lake College: Mount Senario Education Center's website Athletics The school colors were blue and gold, with the athletic teams named the Fighting Saints.

Known for his bestselling novels exploring the roles of entertainment and popular culture in historical America, he has also published a critically acclaimed memoir and worked extensively in a broad range of media, including comics, television and podcasting. Gold is also a collector and authority on comics and graphic novels, particularly the works of Jack Kirby and other architects of the Marvel Universe. Biography Gold was born in Corona del Mar, California, the son of a recording industry executive and a British expatriate mother. His parents divorced when he was ten years old. Relocated to San Francisco, he grew up in a milieu of 70s-era Bohemianism “by the side of his increasingly erratic mother, among con men and get-rich schemes.” When he was twelve, she moved to New York without telling him, leaving him to fend for himself with minimal long-distance support.The Times of London, June 21, 2018 https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/my-mother-left-me-to-look-after-myself-i- was-12-years-old-0hzl35knc Despite his unorthodox childhood, he was admitted to the Thatcher School in Ojai, California. He later studied at Wesleyan University, then transferred to the University of California at Berkeley, where he completed his undergraduate degree. He worked as a freelance writer before entering the graduate writing program at University of California, Irvine, where he received his MFA in creative writing. In 2001, Gold married the novelist Alice Sebold; they have since divorced.Biography Channel – Alice Sebold He currently lives in the Silver Lake region of Los Angeles.https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/07/25/glen-david-golds-memoir- revolves-around-a-mommy-not-so-dearest/ Books =Carter Beats the Devil= His first novel, Carter Beats the Devil (2001) was a national bestseller, receiving critical praiseThe New York Times: Something Up His Sleeve and translation into 14 languages. The New Yorker described it as \\"A magical first novel...one of the most entertaining appearing acts of recent years.\\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/09/24/appearing-act Janet Maslin of The New York Times called it \\"an enormously assured first novel...no small feat of legerdemain.\\"New York Times: Carter Beats the Devil Review A L Kennedy in The Observer stated that \\"Carter Beats the Devil is a big, mischievous, intelligent read – nice to see a bit of magic in fiction again\\".The Observer: Carter Beats the Devil Review The book was a 2001 Washington Post Notable Book of the Year, a Christian Science Monitor Best Book of the Year, and shortlisted for the 2001 Guardian First Book Award. The novel is a fictionalised biography of the American stage magician Charles Joseph Carter (1874–1936), following Carter through his career, from his first encounter with magic to his last performance. Along the way he encounters many historical figures, including fellow magicians Harry Houdini and Howard Thurston, United States President Warren G. Harding, BMW founder Max Friz, the Marx Brothers, business magnate Francis Marion \\"Borax\\" Smith, the inventor of electronic television Philo Farnsworth, and San Franciscan madams Tessie Wall and Jessie Hayman. Most of the novel centers on the mysterious death of President Harding, who dies shortly after taking part in Carter's stage show. President Harding apparently knew of many serious scandals that seemed likely to bring down the establishment, and it seems certain that he was assassinated by persons and methods unknown. Much of Carter's past is shown in the form of flashbacks, as U.S. Secret Service Agent Griffin investigates the magician as a suspect. =Sunnyside= Gold's second novel, Sunnyside (2009) was also both critically well received and a national bestseller.The New York Times: The Tramp Returns Once again interweaving real historical figures and events into a tapestry of fiction, the novel begins in 1916, when a mass delusion results in no less than eight hundred sightings of Charlie Chaplin, appearing simultaneously at various locations throughout the world.

Doctorow . . . full of intelligence, ambition, and generosity.\\" =I Will Be Complete= Gold's first memoir, I Will Be Complete, was published in 2018 by Knopf in the United States, and by Hodder & Stoughton in the United Kingdom.

In 2005, the Hammer Museum and the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art invited him to contribute an essay on Jack Kirby to their exhibit Masters of American Comics, billed as an event \\"to establish a canon of fifteen of the most influential artists working in the medium throughout the 20th century.\\";https://hammer.ucla.edu/exhibitions/2005/masters-of-american-comics/ the catalogue was published by Yale University Press. In 2015, the exhibit Comic Book Apocalypse: The Graphic World of Jack Kirby, presented at California State University, Northridge, commissioned Gold to contribute an essay as well. The resulting work, entitled \\"The Red Sheet\\", was one of the first critical essays to connect Kirby's harrowing experiences as an combat infantryman in World War II with his distinctive approach to comics, postulating that Kirby's creation of Captain America may have been an attempt to mediate (and personify) the effects of Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. \\"Here's something we tend not to think of when evaluating Jack Kirby's artistic intent: Kirby killed Nazis, and he did it in hand-to-hand combat.\\" Gold wrote. \\"He did it with the same hands that drew Captain America and Thor...in fact, he was wrestling with such deep nuances about the intermingled natures of good and evil that they're only comprehensible when viewed through the effects of wartime experience.\\"https://www.idwpublishing.com/product/comic-book-apocalypse-the- graphic-world-of-jack-kirby/ (page 67) Bibliography *Carter Beats the Devil (2001) , ; , *Sunnyside (2009) , *I Will Be Complete (2018) , References  External links   Interview with Glen David Gold * Glen David Gold on Twitter * Glen David Gold's official website 1964 births 21st-century American novelists American television writers American comics writers American male novelists Living people Writers from Long Beach, California Wesleyan University alumni University of California, Irvine alumni American male short story writers 21st-century American short story writers 21st-century American male writers Screenwriters from California American male television writers 21st-century American screenwriters ","title":"Glen David Gold"},{"id":"4006356","text":"Henry Saxe, (born September 24, 1937) is a Canadian sculptor.

It is located in the south-east of the island (part of the traditional South Side division) in the sheading of Middle. Settlements in the parish include Newtown. Local government For the purposes of local government, the whole of the historic parish forms a single parish district with commissioners. The Captain of the Parish (since 2003) is Donald James Gelling, CBE. Politics Santon parish is part of the Middle constituency, which elects two members to the House of Keys. From 1986 until 2016 it was in the Malew and Santon constituency. Geography It has an area of approximately and is the island's smallest parish. The parish is now popularly known as Santon instead of the older Santan. Currently the Captain of the Parish is Mr Donald Gelling. To the north of the parish is Newtown and the recently built estate of Mount Murray where the northern border along the Crogga River Glen is to be found. The western boundary is slightly east of Ballalonna Glen and the modern Fairy Bridge. The coastal extremities stretch from the mouth of the Crogga River at Port Soderick over Santon Head, Port Grenaugh and Port Soldrick to the mouth of the Santon Burn which rarely encroaches on Santon territory but forms the northwestern (inland) boundary for much of its course. While the parish lacks size and good soil, it does have some high cliffs, ancient monuments, ruins, and various other scenery. All along the Manx coastline, and particularly on the rocky slate headlands of the south, are the remains of promontory forts which date back almost 2,000 years. Four out of more than twenty have been excavated and several, especially in Santon, can be visited using the coastal footpath. All have a rampart on their vulnerable landward side, and excavations at have shown that access to the fort was by a strongly built gate.Promontory Forts - Isle of Man Government Manx National Heritage The Scandinavians who arrived in Mann in the 8th and 9th centuries sometimes re-used these Iron Age promontory forts, often obliterating the old domestic quarters with their characteristic rectangular houses; the fine example at has been used as the basis of the reconstruction in the House of Manannan. Demographics The Isle of Man census of 2016 returned a parish population of 700, an increase of 1.3% from the figure of 691 in 2011. Ecclesiastical parish The ecclesiastical parish of Santon no longer exists as a separate area. Until 1 November 2012 it was coterminous with the civil parish (see below), but on that date part of the ecclesiastical parish of Braddan between Mount Murray and Port Walberry, including part of the Mount Murray estate, Port Soderick and Quine's Hill, was transferred to the parish of Santon. On 1 February 2013 the parish of Santon and the parish of Malew (except a detached part of the latter to the west of Castletown) were united to form a new ecclesiastical parish of Malew and Santon. The parish church of the former parish of Santon, which is now one of the four parish churches of the united parish, is St Sanctain. St Sanctain's stands on the site of an ancient 1500-year-old chapel - well before St. Augustine came from Rome to Canterbury. The name St Sanctain is of Irish origin and according to legend, the saint was a disciple of St Patrick and Bishop of Cell da Les (Church of Two Forts). Occasioned by an error, the church was referred to as St Ann (or Anne) during the 17th century and this lasted until it was officially corrected in 1891. The living of Santon was in the patronage of the Crown, in the person of Her Majesty the Queen, the Lord of Mann. Before the Dissolution of the Monasteries, it was in the hands of the Abbot of Rushen Abbey. The united benefice of Malew and Santon is also in the patronage of the Crown. When the Queen appoints a new vicar, the Lieutenant Governor receives presentment documents signed by the Queen. At the Service of Institution and induction of a new vicar, these documents, together with the new vicar, are presented by the Lieutenant Governor to the Bishop of Sodor and Man with the request that the Bishop institute the nominee of the Crown. This duty is always carried out by the Governor in person.

It offers full and part-time programs and is approved by the American Bar Association. Western State pays a fee to receive services from Association of American Law Schools (AALS). View of the campus in Fullerton circa 2010. The school subsequently relocated to Irvine. History Western State College of Law was founded in 1966 in Orange County, California. It is the oldest existing law school in the county. In 1987, the school applied for accreditation with the American Bar Association (ABA). Although the school was unsuccessful in this attempt, it was at the time accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges and by the California State Committee of Bar Examiners (CBE). The accreditation by the CBE made graduates eligible to sit for the California Bar Examination. By 1990, Western State had expanded to three campuses in California including locations in Fullerton, Irvine and San Diego. At that time, the school was the largest law school in California. In 1995, Western State again began pursuing accreditation with the ABA for all three of its campuses. In the latter half of the 1990s, the school underwent several changes as part of the accreditation process. In 1995, the school's San Diego campus became the independently owned Thomas Jefferson School of Law and the following year, the school closed its Irvine location and consolidated students to its Fullerton campus. In 1998, the school received provisional accreditation from the ABA and opened a new law library. In 2000, the college's owners sold Western State to Argosy Education Group, which owned the school for a year before it was purchased by Education Management Corporation. Western State was granted full accreditation with the ABA in 2005, and became the third for-profit law school to receive ABA approval. In April 2012, the school was incorporated as one of the colleges of Argosy University and officially changed its name to Western State College of Law at Argosy University. The same year, the school sold its property to California State University, Fullerton for roughly $18 million. In January 2016, the campus moved to Irvine, California. In October 2017, it was announced that the college of law was sold, along with the rest of Argosy University, to the Dream Center Foundation, a subsidiary of the Dream Center megachurch. The transaction was funded in part by the Najafi Companies, a private equity firm.https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/03/06/large- profit-chain-edmc-be-bought-dream-center-missionary-group Critics have claimed that the sale and shift to non-profit status was designed to evade consumer protection regulations focused on for-profit institutions. In 2019, a federal court approved Westcliff University's plan to purchase the school and revert it to for-profit status. The ABA allowed continued accreditation under the ownership of Westcliff University in December 2019. Academics =Programs= Western State offers both full-time and part-time programs. The school offers two areas of focus through their Business Law Center and their Criminal Law Practice Center, which are aimed at preparing graduates for a career in business or criminal law through additional training, internships and networking with lawyers. The law school also offers certificates in Immigration Law, Family Law, and Real Estate. , the school had 274 full-time students and 149 part-time students, and 61 members of faculty. =Bar passage= The school's bar pass rate was 58% for first-time takers of the July 2019 California bar exam. The Ultimate Bar Pass Rate, which the ABA defines as the pass rate for graduates who sat for a bar exam within two years of graduating, is 76.63% for the Class of 2018. =Rankings= US News and World Report ranks the school in the quartile known as #148-194. Among all law schools, Western State has the third-highest Diversity Index, as reported by US News and World Report. In addition, it received an A+ for Diversity in National Jurist's Best Law Schools. Costs The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at the Western State College of Law for the 2018-19 academic year is $63,692 for a student living at home and $77,126 for a full-time student that is self-supporting. Post-graduation employment According to Western State's ABA-required disclosures, 74% of the Class of 2018 obtained employment nine months after graduation. 62% of the class obtained JD-required or JD-advantage employment. Excluding solo practitioners, 45% of the class obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment.

Oxy. XV 1786) is the earliest known manuscript of a Christian Greek hymn to contain both lyrics and musical notation. It is found on Papyrus 1786 of the Oxyrhynchus papyri, now kept at the Papyrology Rooms of the Sackler Library, Oxford. The manuscript was discovered in 1918 in Oxyrhynchus, Egypt, and later published in 1922.. The hymn was written around the end of the 3rd century AD. Description The lyrics of the Oxyrhynchus hymn were written in Greek, and poetically invoke silence for the praise of the Holy Trinity (i.e. cosmic stillness, a motif of ancient Greek hymnody).. According to Cosgrove, the cosmic stillness motif can be found in Homer's Iliad (19.255–19.256), Callimachus's hymn to Apollo, Limenius's hymn to Apollo, in one of Mesomedes's hymns, in two of Synesius's hymns, etc. Historically, the hymn demonstrates Greek civilizational continuity where erudite Christian Greeks used and accepted the musical notation of their classical Greek predecessors. The music is written in Greek vocal notation. It is entirely diatonic, with an ambitus of exactly an octave from F to F an octave above, and a final nominally on G (assuming a key signature without sharps or flats). The notation is Hypolydian, and employs the rhythmic symbols macron (diseme), leimma + macron, stigme, hyphen, and colon.. The text is largely set syllabically, with a few short melismas. The hymn's meter is essentially anapaestic, though there are some irregularities.. The Oxyrhynchus hymn is the only surviving fragment of notated Christian Greek music from the first four hundred years of the Christian period,; . although historian and musician Kenneth Levy has argued that the Sanctus melody best preserved in the Western medieval Requiem mass dates from around the fourth century.; . Modern recordings of the hymn have been included on a number of releases of Ancient Greek music. Text The Phos Hilaron and the Oxyrhynchus hymn constitute the earliest extant Christian Greek hymn texts reasonably certain to have been used in Christian worship, but are neither drawn from the Bible nor modeled on Biblical passages.. # . . . together all the eminent ones of God. . . # . . . night] nor day (?)

It is a concurrency control mechanism analogous to database transactions for controlling access to shared memory in concurrent computing. Transactional memory systems provide high-level abstraction as an alternative to low-level thread synchronization. This abstraction allows for coordination between concurrent reads and writes of shared data in parallel systems.  Motivation  Atomicity between two parallel transactions with a conflict In concurrent programming, synchronization is required when parallel threads attempt to access a shared resource. Low level thread synchronization constructs such as locks are pessimistic and prohibit threads that are outside a critical section from making any changes. The process of applying and releasing locks often functions as additional overhead in workloads with little conflict among threads. Transactional memory provides optimistic concurrency control by allowing threads to run in parallel with minimal interference. The goal of transactional memory systems is to transparently support regions of code marked as transactions by enforcing atomicity, consistency and isolation. A transaction is a collection of operations that can execute and commit changes as long as a conflict is not present. When a conflict is detected, a transaction will revert to its initial state (prior to any changes) and will rerun until all conflicts are removed. Before a successful commit, the outcome of any operation is purely speculative inside a transaction. In contrast to lock-based synchronization where operations are serialized to prevent data corruption, transactions allow for additional parallelism as long as few operations attempt to modify a shared resource. Since the programmer is not responsible for explicitly identifying locks or the order in which they are acquired, programs that utilize transactional memory cannot produce a deadlock. With these constructs in place, transactional memory provides a high level programming abstraction by allowing programmers to enclose their methods within transactional blocks. Correct implementations ensure that data cannot be shared between threads without going through a transaction and produce a serializable outcome. For example, code can be written as: def transfer_money(from_account, to_account, amount): \\"\\"\\"Transfer money from one account to another.\\"\\"\\" with transaction(): from_account -= amount to_account += amount In the code, the block defined by \\"transaction\\" is guaranteed atomicity, consistency and isolation by the underlying transactional memory implementation and is transparent to the programmer. The variables within the transaction are protected from external conflicts, ensuring that either the correct amount is transferred or no action is taken at all. Note that concurrency related bugs are still possible in programs that use a large number of transactions, especially in software implementations where the library provided by the language is unable to enforce correct use. Bugs introduced through transactions can often be difficult to debug since breakpoints cannot be placed within a transaction. Transactional memory is limited in that it requires a shared-memory abstraction. Although transactional memory programs cannot produce a deadlock, programs may still suffer from a livelock or resource starvation. For example, longer transactions may repeatedly revert in response to multiple smaller transactions, wasting both time and energy.  Hardware vs. software  Hardware transactional memory using read and write bits The abstraction of atomicity in transactional memory requires a hardware mechanism to detect conflicts and undo any changes made to shared data. Hardware transactional memory systems may comprise modifications in processors, cache and bus protocol to support transactions. Speculative values in a transaction must be buffered and remain unseen by other threads until commit time. Large buffers are used to store speculative values while avoiding write propagation through the underlying cache coherence protocol. Traditionally, buffers have been implemented using different structures within the memory hierarchy such as store queues or caches. Buffers further away from the processor, such as the L2 cache, can hold more speculative values (up to a few megabytes). The optimal size of a buffer is still under debate due to the limited use of transactions in commercial programs. In a cache implementation, the cache lines are generally augmented with read and write bits. When the hardware controller receives a request, the controller uses these bits to detect a conflict. If a serializability conflict is detected from a parallel transaction, then the speculative values are discarded. When caches are used, the system may introduce the risk of false conflicts due to the use of cache line granularity. Load-link/store-conditional (LL/SC) offered by many RISC processors can be viewed as the most basic transactional memory support; however, LL/SC usually operates on data that is the size of a native machine word, so only single-word transactions are supported. Although hardware transactional memory provides maximal performance compared to software alternatives, limited use has been seen at this time. Software transactional memory provides transactional memory semantics in a software runtime library or the programming language, and requires minimal hardware support (typically an atomic compare and swap operation, or equivalent). As the downside, software implementations usually come with a performance penalty, when compared to hardware solutions. Hardware acceleration can reduce some of the overheads associated with software transactional memory. Owing to the more limited nature of hardware transactional memory (in current implementations), software using it may require fairly extensive tuning to fully benefit from it. For example, the dynamic memory allocator may have a significant influence on performance and likewise structure padding may affect performance (owing to cache alignment and false sharing issues); in the context of a virtual machine, various background threads may cause unexpected transaction aborts.  History  One of the earliest implementations of transactional memory was the gated store buffer used in Transmeta's Crusoe and Efficeon processors. However, this was only used to facilitate speculative optimizations for binary translation, rather than any form of speculative multithreading, or exposing it directly to programmers. Azul Systems also implemented hardware transactional memory to accelerate their Java appliances, but this was similarly hidden from outsiders. Sun Microsystems implemented hardware transactional memory and a limited form of speculative multithreading in its high-end Rock processor. This implementation proved that it could be used for lock elision and more complex hybrid transactional memory systems, where transactions are handled with a combination of hardware and software. The Rock processor was canceled in 2009, just before the acquisition by Oracle; while the actual products were never released, a number of prototype systems were available to researchers. In 2009, AMD proposed the Advanced Synchronization Facility (ASF), a set of x86 extensions that provide a very limited form of hardware transactional memory support. The goal was to provide hardware primitives that could be used for higher-level synchronization, such as software transactional memory or lock-free algorithms. However, AMD has not announced whether ASF will be used in products, and if so, in what timeframe. More recently, IBM announced in 2011 that Blue Gene/Q had hardware support for both transactional memory and speculative multithreading. The transactional memory could be configured in two modes; the first is an unordered and single- version mode, where a write from one transaction causes a conflict with any transactions reading the same memory address. The second mode is for speculative multithreading, providing an ordered, multi-versioned transactional memory. Speculative threads can have different versions of the same memory address, and hardware implementation keeps track of the age for each thread. The younger threads can access data from older threads (but not the other way around), and writes to the same address are based on the thread order. In some cases, dependencies between threads can cause the younger versions to abort. Intel's Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX) is available in some of the Skylake processors. It was earlier implemented in Haswell and Broadwell processors as well, but the implementations turned out both times to be defective and support for TSX was disabled. The TSX specification describes the transactional memory API for use by software developers, but withholds details on technical implementation. ARM architecture has a similar extension. As of GCC 4.7, an experimental library for transactional memory is available which utilizes a hybrid implementation. The PyPy variant of Python also introduces transactional memory to the language.

It officially opened in September 2002, giving students in Hackney the opportunity to study at a college close to where they live. Brooke House has previously been the site of other educational institutions. BSix Brooke House Sixth Form College was opened on the Brooke House school site in September 2002. It was set up by the then Secretary of State for Education, David Blunkett, and formed part of an unrealised plan to build eleven new sixth form colleges in London. BSix is unusual in the sixth form college sector because it offers courses at all levels and across a wide range of subjects, including vocational courses, like Hair and Beauty, Business and Art as well as a significant number of “A” levels. After an initial surge of enthusiasm, the educational context changed rapidly. Hackney's local education authority, The Learning Trust, introduced a programme to create five City Academies in the borough, all with sixth forms. As a consequence, many other 11-16 schools applied to open their own sixth forms. The growth in student recruitment was not as rapid as the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), the funding body, had anticipated. In 2005 the college was inspected by Ofsted and judged to be satisfactory. In April 2006 the founding Principal, Angela O’Donoghue, was promoted to lead the much larger City Of Sunderland College. The LSC and the governing body took the opportunity to review the future of BSix. An interim Principal, Joe West, was given the task of canvassing opinion about merger, closure or continuation for the college. The conclusion of the report, the LSC and the governors was that BSix should continue as an independent institution. A new Principal, Ken Warman, took up post on 30 October 2006.

It operated from 1952 until 2007, with its first graduating class in 1953. LCEHS fell under the command of the U.S. Naval Activities, United Kingdom (COMNAVACTUK). History London Central High School (commonly known as \\"LCHS\\" or just \\"Central\\") was established in 1952 at Bushy Park, in south west London, for students in grades 7 through 12. Subsequent base closures led to two moves: to Bushey Hall in 1962, and to RAF Daws Hill, its final location, in 1971. For the 2006–07 school year, LCHS merged with West Ruislip Elementary School, which had closed in the spring of 2006. Consequently, it accommodated grades K-12 and \\"elementary\\" was added to the school's name. At the time of its closing, LCEHS was the last remaining DoDDS school with dormitories. The USNAVEUR Headquarters were relocated from London to Naples, Italy in 2007. As a result, RAF Daws Hill, along with other naval installations in the area, was scaled down and eventually closed. LCHS staged a formal closing ceremony on May 15, 2007 and locked its doors for the last time in June 2007, with a handover of keys back to the US Navy/RAF on 30 June. The website was completely removed in mid-June 2014. Student body Circa 2005 the average number of students was 360. Students originated from the United States and Canada, with most students being in military families; those from non-military families paid tuition fees. The school had a high rate of students enrolling or transferred away due to job changes. Students living in dormitories, which served grades 9-12, had parents doing military duties or other duties for the U.S. federal government in remote areas in other countries; circa 2005 there were at least 75 students boarding.

The term is still regularly used in Canadian political discussion. Trudeau, who had in previous years been a strong proponent of civil liberties, spoke of the need for drastic action to restore order in Quebec. When questioned by CBC reporter Tim Ralfe on how far he would go in the suspension of civil liberties to maintain order, Trudeau replied \\"Well, just watch me.\\" Three days later, he invoked the War Measures Act, which led to police action against many Quebec dissidents and great public controversy. Just Watch Me: Trudeau and the '70s Generation is the title of a 1999 documentary by Catherine Annau. The phrase has also been the title of several biographies of Trudeau, e.g., Larry Zolf's Just Watch Me: Remembering Pierre Trudeau (1984); Ron Coleman's Just Watch Me: Trudeau's Tragic Legacy (2003); and the 2nd volume of John English's biography, Just Watch Me: The Life of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, 1968–2000 (2009). In March 2013, Trudeau's son Justin, while running for the Liberal Party leadership, made a rare gesture of evoking his father's memory during his campaign by repeating this phrase. It was in answer to a fellow airplane passenger's question in a handwritten note, asking Justin if he could beat Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper. The comment sparked a frenzy on Twitter, as well as mixed reaction from several commentators, some of whom saw the quote as a politically sensitive and risky one in Quebec. Two years later, Justin Trudeau became Prime Minister of Canada, beating Harper in federal election by a significant margin.

It overlooks Strangford Lough and is 7 miles from Downpatrick and 1.5 miles from Strangford. Castle Ward is open to the public and includes of landscaped gardens, a fortified tower house, Victorian laundry, theatre, restaurant, shop, saw mill and a working corn mill. It has a shore on Strangford Lough. From 1985 to 2010 it has also hosted Castleward Opera, an annual summer opera festival. Features The most interesting aspect of Castle Ward is that of its dual architecture, representing the differing tastes of Lord Bangor and his wife, Lady Ann Bligh. While the entrance side of the building is done in a classical Palladian style with columns supporting a triangular pediment, the opposite side is Georgian Gothic with pointed windows, battlements and finials. This difference in style continues throughout the interior of the house with the divide down the centre. Old Castle Ward There is a tower house in the estate's farmyard, built as a defensive structure during 1610 by Nicholas Ward.  History  Castle Ward has been the home of the Ward family since ca. 1570. Known originally as Carrick na Sheannagh and owned by the Earls of Kildare, it was bought by Bernard Ward, father of Sir Robert Ward, Surveyor-General of Ireland. The 850 acre walled demesne also dates from the 16th century. The Ward family built a succession of homes in their estate; Old Castle Ward, built about 1590 near to Strangford Lough, still survives, but a mansion built about 1720 by Judge Michael Ward was demolished about 1850, although some of the associated landscaping remains. The architect of the current building, built during the early 1760s for Michael Ward's son Bernard Ward, 1st Viscount Bangor is unknown, although he may have come from the Bristol area, with which the Ward family had associations. It may have been James Bridges who practiced in Bristol between 1757 and 1763 and whose work there has some similarity to Castle Ward. The property was inherited by a settlement made in 1748 by Bernard Ward's eldest son, Nicholas, 2nd Viscount Bangor, who was clearly insane. When his younger brother, Edward, died in 1812, leaving a young son, the youngest brother Robert took the opportunity to relocate the insane Nicholas into a smaller house in Downpatrick and strip Castle Ward of everything valuable. The house stood empty until the death of Nicholas in 1827, when it was inherited by Edward's son, now the 3rd Viscount. He and his descendants restored the building and its furnishings, but on the death of the 6th Viscount in 1950 the house and estate were given in lieu of death duties to the Government of Northern Ireland, who presented the house and its gardens to the National Trust in 1952. On 10 February 1973, Leonard O'Hanlon (age 23) and Vivienne Fitzsimmons (age 17), both members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army, were killed when the bomb they planted exploded prematurely in the grounds of Castle Ward estate.

Although most strongly identified with the Americana music tradition, his music also incorporates elements of folk, rock, and the cowboy music of the American West. Many of his songs have been recorded by other artists, including Johnny Cash, The Texas Tornados, k.d. lang, Guy Clark, Joe Ely, The Sir Douglas Quintet, Jason Boland, Nanci Griffith, Katy Moffatt, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Sailcat, Iris Dement, Dave Alvin, and Suzy Bogguss. In addition to his music, Russell is also a painter and author. He has published a book of songwriting quotes (co-edited with Sylvia Tyson), a detective novel (in Scandinavia), and a book of letters with Charles Bukowski. His recent works include two books from Bangtail Press: 120 Songs of Tom Russell, and Blue Horse/Red Desert - The Art of Tom Russell, a book of selected paintings. In 2016 a new book of Tom Russell essays was published: Ceremonies of the Horsemen. The essays, originally published in Ranch & Reata magazine, are centered on the American West and include an essay on Johnny Cash for which Russell won a 2015 ASCAP AWARD for music journalism. Early life and career Russell was born in Los Angeles. He graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara with a master's degree in sociology of law and criminology. In 1969, he spent a year teaching in Ibadan, Nigeria, during the Biafran War. He has also lived in Spain and Norway -- and played music at a circus in Puerto Rico. He began his musical career in the early 1970s in Vancouver, British Columbia, playing strip bars along Skid Row, then later relocated to Texas and formed a band with singer-pianist Patricia Hardin. In 1977, the duo moved to San Francisco, performing regularly in clubs there as Hardin & Russell, during which time they recorded the second of their two studio albums. They eventually split in 1979, at which point Russell drifted out of the music industry for a year. It was during this hiatus that Russell wrote his classic song \\"Gallo Del Cielo\\". Both Hardin & Russell albums (Ring of Bone and Wax Museum) received high critical acclaim, and the first was reviewed in Rolling Stone by Chet Flippo. During this period Russell was also the winner of the first Woody Guthrie - William Oliver Award for songwriting, as well as the professional country category in the first American Song Festival. Russell moved to New York City in 1980 and while working as a taxi driver in Queens, he met guitarist Andrew Hardin (no relation to Patricia). After hearing his songs, Hardin convinced him that they should form a new band. Shortly afterward, Robert Hunter of the Grateful Dead was a passenger in Russell's cab; Russell sang Hunter his song \\"Gallo Del Cielo\\" and an impressed Hunter invited Russell to join him on stage at New York's Bitter End. Hunter encouraged Russell to make a full-fledged return to the music business and Russell later opened for Hunter at the Lone Star Cafe. Hunter sang Russell's \\"Gallo Del Cielo\\" at the Glastonbury Festival in the UK. Andrew Hardin remained Russell's full-time sideman until April, 2006. \\"Gallo del Cielo\\" became one of Russell's most fabled songs and has been recorded by Ian Tyson, Joe Ely, Brian Burns, Jason Boland and the Stragglers, and Katie Lee. The song has been cited as a favorite by Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen (as noted in Clarence Clemons' book Big Man.) Tom Russell Band Between 1984 and 1994, the Tom Russell Band, composed of Russell on acoustic guitar and vocals, Andrew Hardin (guitar), Fats Kaplin (pedal steel, fiddle, harmonica, button accordion), Billy Troiani (bass), Rich Crane, Charlie Caldarola, and Mike Warner (drums), released four albums on Philo Records. These albums blended elements of folk, country and rock music, and often featured songs inspired by the American Southwest, blue-collar American life, and events from Russell's own life (for instance, the track \\"Road to Bayamon\\" draws on his experiences playing in a carnival in Puerto Rico). Russell's storytelling approach was also prominent in songs such as \\"Haley's Comet\\", which was also recorded by co-writer Dave Alvin and Doug Sahm and The Texas Tornados. \\"Haley's Comet\\" imaginatively recalls the last, tragic days in the life of rock and roll music legend Bill Haley. These early Tom Russell albums are now considered pioneering recordings of the genre which would come to be known as Americana. Russell was next signed to HighTone Records in California. He released five albums for Hightone before the label was acquired by Shout! Factory Records. Russell's first album on the HighTone label, The Rose of the San Joaquin, was produced by Dave Alvin and Greg Leisz. The Man From God Knows Where In the 1990s Russell released several critically acclaimed solo albums and also collaborated with blues singer Barrence Whitfield on two albums (Hillbilly Voodoo and Cowboy Mambo - recently released as a double CD). Russell also recorded an acoustic album mixing new material with his favorite cowboy-themed songs. His albums include guest appearances from other folk, country, and Americana artists, such as Chris Gaffney and Dave Alvin. Russell's song \\"Outbound Plane\\", co-written with Nanci Griffith, became a top- ten country hit for Suzy Bogguss. However, his most significant album of the 1990s was the innovative 1999 folk opera, The Man From God Knows Where. Drawing on the music of Norway and Ireland in addition to American folk and country, The Man From God Knows Where is a song cycle tracing the journeys of Russell's ancestors from Europe to America and the struggles they encountered. Recorded in Norway near the spot where his great-grandfather was born in 1847, the album features singers Iris DeMent, Dolores Keane, Dave Van Ronk, and Kari Bremnes, portraying (and telling the stories of) Russell's various ancestors. The album's title came from the epitaph of a different Tom Russell, an Irish activist executed in 1803. Recent work Russell's albums in the 21st century have been heavily influenced by the art, culture, history and folklore of the American Southwest. Albums such as Borderland resonate with a strong and authentic Tex-Mex influence, reflecting life on both sides of the border. Russell's songs \\"Tonight We Ride\\" and \\"Navajo Rug\\" were chosen by members of the Western Writers of America as two of the top 100 Western songs of all time. In 2005 Russell released Hotwalker, the second part of his Americana trilogy (the first part being The Man From God Knows Where). It was another conceptual work largely inspired by his correspondence with author Charles Bukowski. Subtitled A Ballad for Gone America, the album features songs and spoken word pieces, many of the latter delivered by another friend of Bukowski, circus midget Little Jack Horton. The sampled voices of Lenny Bruce and Edward Abbey are also heard on the album, which takes the form of a musical collage lamenting the passing of the America of Russell's childhood and the Beat Generation. Jack Kerouac, Charles Bukowski, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Harry Partch, and Dave Van Ronk also appear on the record. Russell made five nationally televised appearances on the Late Show with David Letterman, as well as playing a show for Letterman in Montana. In 2006, Russell released Love and Fear, a collection of original songs that were inspired by the highs and lows of his own relationships. This was followed in 2007 by Wounded Heart of America, a tribute album of Tom Russell songs covered by other artists, including Johnny Cash, Doug Sahm, Joe Ely, Suzy Bogguss, Dave Alvin, Jerry Jeff Walker, and beat poet laureate Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Two new songs, \\"Who's Gonna Build Your Wall?\\" and \\"The Death of Jimmy Martin\\", are also included on the album. In 2008, Russell's new record company, Shout! Factory, released a 2-CD retrospective album entitled Veteran's Day: Anthology. Russell and legendary Canadian singer/songwriter Ian Tyson held court at Elko, Nevada's National Cowboy Poetry Gathering, producing Mano a Mano, a DVD on the art of songwriting. In 2009, Shout! Factory released Russell's album Blood and Candle Smoke, featuring twelve original songs. The album was recorded at WaveLab Recording Studio in Tucson, Arizona with members of Calexico providing a world music beat to many of the songs. The album was produced by Tom Russell and Craig Schumacher, who has worked with Neko Case, Iron & Wine and Calexico. 2011 saw Russell release both a new album, Mesabi, and a documentary DVD, Don't Look Down. In 2013, Frontera Records released Aztec Jazz, a concert recording made with the Norwegian Wind Ensemble (the oldest working orchestra in the world). With the ensemble, Russell was able to realize the vision of reframing some of his more recent songs. He also released Museum of Memories Vol. 2 (1973–2013), a collection of demos, outtakes and previously unreleased live recordings covering a forty-year span. 2014 saw the release of several new projects, including two on Frontera Records: Midway To Bayamon, a compilation of two mid-80s cassette-only releases plus bonus tracks, and Tonight We Ride, an anthology of cowboy songs, including some previously unreleased tracks. The Rockbeat label issued a 2-CD set, The Western Years, collecting western-themed songs primarily from Russell's years on the HighTone label. Rockbeat also re-issued the acclaimed Americana classic Tulare Dust: A Songwriters' Tribute To Merle Haggard which Russell co-produced with Dave Alvin, including a bonus disc taken from a live concert given by many of the artists involved with the project. In April 2015 Russell released The Rose of Roscrae, a double-album on Frontera Records, a Western folk opera that completes the trilogy begun with The Man From God Knows Where and Hotwalker. The double album depicts the journey of an Irishman named Johnny Dutton who sails to America to become a cowboy. There are 52 tracks interspersed with historic and contemporary voices that include: Johnny Cash, Walt Whitman, John Trudell, Lead Belly, Joe Ely, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Tex Ritter, Eliza Gilkyson, Augie Meyers, Finbar Furey, Maura O'Connell, Jimmy LaFave, A.L. Lloyd, Glen Orhlin, Sourdough Slim, David Olney and others, as well as an overture by Mats Halling and The Norwegian Wind Ensemble. The Rose of Roscrae was hailed as the top folk album of 2015 in many publications, including The Irish Times, Mojo Magazine, Uncut Magazine, and The Los Angeles Times. In 2016 Frontera Records released the second Tom Russell Anthology: Gunpowder Sunsets, including favorites from recent albums along with previously unreleased material. Russell released two projects in 2017, \\"Play One More: The Songs of Ian & Sylvia\\" through True North Records, and the Frontera Records release of new original songs, \\"Folk Hotel,\\" which was well received. To replace the out-of-print \\"Veteran's Day\\" anthology, Russell returned to the studio with former guitarist Andrew Hardin to re-record his best known songs in an acoustic format called \\"Old Songs Yet To Sing.\\" In 2019, Russell released an album of new compositions, \\"October in the Railroad Earth,\\" featuring Bill Kirchen on guitar and Eliza Gilkyson guesting on harmony vocals on two tracks. The project was favorably reviewed by critics, including a 4-star review on allmusic.

Pawnee and Otoe Indians attacked the expedition in Nebraska, killing 36 of the 40 Spaniards, 10 of their Indian allies, and a French guide. The survivors retreated to their base in New Mexico.  Background  In the first part of the 18th century, French explorers and fur traders began to enter the plains west of the Missouri River, which they claimed as Louisiana. In 1714, Étienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont became the first colonial explorer known to have reached the mouth of the Platte River, although other French traders may have visited the area and lived among the Indians.Norall, Frank (1988), Bourgmont, Explorer of the Missouri, 1698–1725, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, pp. 24–27. Spain had claimed ownership of the Great Plains since the Coronado expedition of the 16th century, but had done little to assert this claim, and now worried about the growing French influence in the region. In 1718, the War of the Quadruple Alliance broke out between France and Spain.\\"Villasur Sent to Nebraska: Recording the Massacre\\", Nebraska Studies, accessed August 24, 2011  Expedition  The governor of the Spanish colony of Nuevo México based in Santa Fe ordered Villasur to capture French traders on the plains. Spanish authorities hoped to gather intelligence about French ambitions in the region. Villasur had no experience with Indians, but he left Santa Fe on June 16, 1720, leading an expedition which included about 40 soldiers of a mounted frontier corps known as \\"Cuera\\" or leather soldiers, 60 to 70 Pueblo allies, a priest, a Spanish trader, and approximately 12 Apache guides, who were tribal enemies of the Pawnee. Scout leader José Naranjo was of African-Hopi parentage, and he might have previously reached the South Platte River area.Alfred Thomas, After Coronado: Spanish Exploration Northeast of New Mexico, 1696–1727; Documents from the Archives of Spain Mexico and New Mexico (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1935, third printing 1969) , pp. 156, 275n118. The expedition made its way northeast through Colorado, Kansas, and Nebraska. In August, they made contact with the Pawnee and Otoe along the Platte and Loup rivers. Villasur made several attempts to negotiate with Indians in the area, using Francisco Sistaca, a Pawnee held as a slave, to translate. On August 13, Sistaca disappeared from camp. Villasur camped that night just south of the Loup–Platte confluence near Columbus, Nebraska, nervous about the possibility of attack and the increasing number and belligerence of the Pawnee and Otoe Indians.The Pawnee Indians. George E. Hyde 1951. New edition in The Civilization of the American Indian Series, University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, 1974. , pp. 75–76  Battle  The Pawnees and Otoes attacked at dawn on August 14, shooting heavy musketry fire and flights of arrows, then charging into combat clad only in paint, headbands, moccasins, and short leggings. Some survivors reported that Frenchmen had been among the attackers, and men in European dress are shown in a surviving painting of the battle. The Spanish were mostly asleep at this hour; possibly Sistaca had told the Pawnees the best time to attack. In a brief battle, they killed 36 Spaniards, including Villasur and Naranjo, 10 Pueblo scouts, and Jean L'Archevêque, a Frenchman who had been brought as an interpreter. The Pueblo allies were encamped nearby but separately from the Spanish, and they were not the first targets of the attack; most of them escaped. The few Cuera soldiers who escaped were horse-holders, who were able to break loose while their comrades attempted to form a defensive cluster.  Aftermath  The Spanish and Pueblo survivors returned to Santa Fe on September 6. The expedition had journeyed farther to the north and east than any other Spanish military expedition, and its defeat marked the end of Spanish influence on the central Great Plains. The governors of New Mexico inquired into and apportioned blame for the disaster over the next seven years. The French in Illinois were elated to learn of the battle in October, but subsequent French expeditions did not establish French trade and influence in the area.\\"The Villasur Expedition: The Battle\\", Nebraska Studies, accessed August 24, 2011  Notes   References   External links  * Nebraska Studies.org: \\"Villasur Sent to Nebraska\\" * NMHistorymuseum.org: \\"The Segesser Hides Explorer\\" Expeditions from Spain Military expeditions Louisiana (New France) Colonial New Mexico Colonial United States (Spanish) Pawnee 1720 in New France 1720 in New Spain 1720s in New Mexico Conflicts in 1720 Pre-statehood history of Colorado Pre-statehood history of Kansas Pre-statehood history of Nebraska Spanish conquests in the Americas ","title":"Villasur expedition"},{"id":"4006557","title":"1987 Australian Open"},{"id":"4006559","text":"Lake Steilacoom is a reservoir approximately 4 km (2.5 mi) southwest of Tacoma in Pierce County, Washington, United States.

The lake is fed at its southeastern end by two creeks: Ponce de Leon Creek, which originates in springs below what is now Lakewood Towne Center, as well as Clover Creek which flows from its source near Frederickson to the lake. The reservoir was created in 1853 when Andrew Byrd built a dam across Chambers Creek, flooding what had previously been a small pond in a wetland. The dam was used for his sawmill (also built in 1853) and a grist mill (100 yards downstream, in 1857). A public boat launch can be found on the eastern shore in Edgewater Park. The smaller pond was known as Lake Wyatchew prior to the dam's installation, and was briefly known later as Byrd's lake. The Rhodesleigh mansion is located by the lake.

Marsh worked to build Team Elite under SwimMAC Carolina since 2007. Prior to founding Team Elite he was the men's and women's swimming coach at Auburn University. After becoming head coach of Auburn in 1990, Marsh led the men's team to seven NCAA national championships (1997, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007) and the women's team to five national championships (2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007). He finished his coaching career at Auburn at the conclusion of the 2007 season, after which he became the Head Elite Coach and CEO of the United States Olympic Committee Center of Excellence with SwimMAC Carolina. To date, Marsh has led SwimMAC to three consecutive USA club excellence championships, a first for any program, outdistancing the second-place finisher by 12,000 points (see www.usaswimming.org). He was the head swim coach for University of California San Diego, an NCAA Division II program for two seasons from 2017 to 2019.\\"DAVID MARSH TO TAKE HEAD COACHING ROLE AT UC SAN DIEGO\\" The internationally known coach has coached 49 Olympians from 19 different countries. In December 2016 Marsh was named the ‘Professional Adviser’ of the Israel Swimming Association, with a goal of preparing the country's swimmers for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Early life Marsh is originally from Miami, Florida and received his degree in Business Administration from Auburn in 1981. Marsh was a five-time All-American backstroker at Auburn.  Success at Auburn  Marsh is the most successful Auburn coach regardless of sport. He is arguably the most successful coach in the state of Alabama and the SEC, perhaps even the country. Marsh's 12 NCAA titles surpass the six won by football coach Bear Bryant at Alabama and the ten by John Wooden. Even breaking down the Men's and Women's titles separately, Marsh's seven men's titles beat Bryant. Marsh has won 17 SEC titles (13 men and 4 women), by far the most of any Auburn coach or team. In 2003 he led both the men's and women's teams to a sweep of the NCAA titles, a first in collegiate Swimming and Diving. Marsh and the Tigers went on to repeat this accomplishment three more times (2004, 2006, and 2007). Marsh inherited a strong swimming program that was a fixture in the national swimming scene and regularly in the top 20 but was in a slump and turned it into a dynastic powerhouse. Since Marsh took over the Auburn swimming and diving program, Auburn's men finished in the Top 10 every year but his first two years (1991 & 1992 Auburn teams finished 20th and 15th). In 1990, the year before Marsh came to Auburn, the team failed to qualify any swimmers for the NCAA Division I Championship Meet; in Marsh's first year in 1991, the men's team placed 20th at the championship meet. In 1993 the Tigers finished #6 in the NCAAs and have not fallen out of the top 10 since, with the lowest placing in that time being #7 in 2001. The women have been equally successful, jumping from #30 in Marsh's first year to #8 in his second of 92. The lowest finish for the Tiger women since 1992 was #13 in 1995. SwimMAC Carolina (formerly known as Mecklenburg Aquatic Club ) Marsh, Head Coach at Auburn University, became CEO & Director of Coaching for SwimMAC Carolina Mecklenburg Aquatic Club in the summer of 2007. Marsh focused his attention on developing an Elite component of the program, for athletes who rise to a world-class level from within the SwimMAC program, as well as those relocating to North Carolina, such as post-graduate and professional swimmers focusing on their Olympic dreams. Marsh stated, “I am thrilled to have had the opportunity to move to Charlotte and join one of the country's premier programs. I have a long history with SwimMAC athletes and have found them to be remarkable individuals. SwimMAC athletes such as Aaron Ciarla, Daniel Slocki, and Catherine Caldwell have been a key part of the championship program we have built at Auburn. I look forward to joining the quality coaching staff at this club and working with the coaches, athletes, and parents to build a championship program in Charlotte.” In 2016 Marsh and Team Elite placed Anthony Ervin, Ryan Lochte, Cammille Adams, Kathleen Baker, Jimmy Feigen, and Katie Meili on the US Olympic Team. In late 2016, the board decided to move forward without Marsh as CEO and agreed to work to redefine his and Team Elite's role at the club. In May 2017, SwimMAC and Marsh announced a mutual parting of ways. Olympians Marsh has coached 49 Olympians from 19 different countries. Individual champions Marsh's swimmers have combined to win 89 individual NCAA titles and 277 individual SEC titles. Auburn swimmers have also brought home 90 medals from international competitions such as the World Championships, Goodwill Games, Pan-American Games, and the Olympics.  2016 Olympics  On September 9, 2015, USA Swimming announced that Marsh would serve as the head coach of the women's roster of the 2016 US Olympic Swimming Team. Marsh stated: \\"I will do all I can to uphold the unmatched tradition of excellence that has been established by the swimmers and coaches from the previous Olympic Games.\\" A total of 8 medals were achieved by the Team Elite Athletes. 1 Gold for Ryan Lochte (4x200 relay), 2 Gold for Anthony Ervin (100 free relay prelims & 50 free); 2 for Katie Meili (Bronze 100 Br & Gold 4x100 Medley relay prelims); 1 Gold for Jimmy Feigen (4x100 free relay prelims); 2 for Kathleen Baker (Silver 100 back; Gold 4x100 medley relay) Israel In December 2016 Marsh was named the ‘Professional Adviser’ of the Israel Swimming Association, with a goal of preparing the country's swimmers for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.Israel’s top swimmers target success at Worlds - Israel News - Jerusalem Post\\"DAVID MARSH TAKES ON PROFESSIONAL ADVISER ROLE WITH ISRAELI SWIMMING\\" Coaching honors CSCAA Women's Coach of the Year: \`01, \`02, \`03 CSCAA Men's Coach of the Year: \`94, \`97, \`99, \`03, \`04 SEC Men's Coach of the Year: \`92, \`93, \`97, \`98, \`99, \`01, \`03, \`04, \`05 SEC Women's Coach of the Year: \`93, \`02, \`03 Knoxville News-Sentinel Men's Coach of the Year: \`93, \`95, \`98, \`99, \`01, \`03, \`04 Knoxville News-Sentinel Women's Coach of the Year: \`92, \`93, \`03 Inside the Auburn Tigers Coach of the Year: \`93, \`96, \`97, \`03, \`04 2016 USA Women's Olympic Team Head Coach 2014 USA Women's Team Assistant Pan Pac Championships, Australia 2012 USA Men's Olympic Team Assistant 2010 USA Men's Duel in the Pool Head Coach 2005 USA World Championships Assistant Men's Assistant Coach 2003 USA World Championships Head Coach 2003 & 2005 USA Men's Mutual of Omaha Duel in the Pool Head Coach 2000 & 2003 National Collegiate and Scholastic Swimming Trophy 2003 Board Member of the Greater Lee County Boys and Girls Club 2000 USA Men's Olympic Team Assistant Coach 1999 USA Men's Pan-Pacific Team Assistant Coach 1996 USA Men's Olympic Team Assistant Coach 1995 USA Men's Pan-Pacific Team Head Coach 1994 USA Women's Assistant Coach-World Championship Team Honored on the \\"Tiger Trail\\" of Auburn which commemorates athletic achievements by coaches and athletes. 2016 Inducted into the North Carolina Swimming Hall of Fame 2015 Inducted into the Auburn Swimming Hall of Fame Marsh also serves on the boards of the American Swimming Coaches Association as well as the Championship Performance Advisory Board.

Fusion centers may also be affiliated with an Emergency Operations Center that responds in the event of a disaster. The National Network of Fusion Centers was established after the September 11 attacks to allow collaboration across jurisdictions in order to respond to criminal and terrorist activity. It is a decentralized, distributed, self- organizing network of individual fusion centers and their respective partners within each center's area of responsibility. The process is a method of managing the flow of information and intelligence across levels and sectors of government to integrate information for analysis.[1] Fusion centers rely on the active involvement of state, local, tribal, and federal law enforcement agencies—and sometimes on non-law enforcement agencies—to provide intelligence for their analysis. The intent is that, as the diversity of information sources increases, there will be more accurate and robust analysis that can be disseminated as intelligence. The effectiveness of this strategy is disputed. Reports by the US House of Representatives Committee on Homeland security have found fusion centers to be a national asset, though they have at times raised concerns about the ability to evaluate their effectiveness. A 2012 Senate report analyzed 13 months of fusion center reports and found no instances where they helped uncover or prevent a terror attack. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Department of Homeland Security have separately raised concerns about the threats fusion centers pose to privacy rights such as excessive secrecy, little oversight, and mission creep. The actions of individual fusion centers have also been criticized for actions such as labeling universities as terrorism threats, targeting third party candidates and supporters as potential militia members, and incorrectly blaming a faulty water pump on Russian hackers. Operations A fusion center is a collaborative effort between law enforcement agencies to share resources, expertise, and information in order to detect criminal and terrorist activity. The goal is to integrate the information each agency has together to prevent security gaps due to lack of communication. A fusion center is typically organized by combining representatives from different federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies into one physical location. Some fusion centers gather information not only from government sources, but also from their partners in the private sector. Each representative is intended to report information from their agency and use that agency-specific information to contribute to the collective analysis of the group. Similarly, the representative reports the analytic products and threat information back to their home agency. State and local police departments provide both space and resources for the majority of fusion centers. The analysts working there can be drawn from a range of agencies and organizations, including DHS, FBI, Customs and Border Protection, Drug Enforcement Administration, Coast Guard, National Guard, Highway Patrol, state-level Departments of Corrections, local police, and the private sector. A number of fusion centers operate tip hotlines and also invite relevant information from public employees, such as sanitation workers or firefighters. Fusion centers are often confused with investigative support centers or emergency operations centers. Investigative support centers, for example, respond to inquiries and requests from investigators, whereas fusion centers have the responsibility of proactively gathering intelligence, analyzing that information, and then disseminating it to their local, state and federal partners. Fusion centers are also constantly staffed, unlike emergency operations centers which are minimally staffed until a crisis. The National Fusion Center Association The NFCA is an association that represents all of the fusion centers located across the country that make up the National Network. It is headed by an Executive board composed of a President, Vice President, Executive Director, Treasurer, Secretary, and two regional co-chairs that represent Fusion Centers from the North East, South East, Central, and West regions of the country. The mission of the NFCA is as follows: \\"To represent the interests of state and major urban area fusion centers, as well as associated interests of states, tribal nations, and units of local government, in order to promote the development and sustainment of fusion centers to enhance public safety; encourage effective, efficient, ethical, lawful, and professional intelligence and information sharing; and prevent and reduce the harmful effects of crime and terrorism on victims, individuals, and communities.\\" Below are the overarching goals of the NFCA in their support of the National Network, and clearly define their existence as an association. * Provide an independent and consolidated voice for state and major urban area fusion centers; * Maintain the focus of state, tribal, local, and federal governments on the needs of the fusion centers; * Represent fusion center concerns to the federal government through an education process; * Provide support for the development of effective fusion center policy for the nation's state and local government elected officials and tribal leaders; * Serve as a catalyst for the careful consideration and promotion of effective and efficient fusion center policies and practices; * Advocate for the commitment of adequate resources to support a national, integrated network of state and major urban area fusion centers; and * Coordinate between and among the different branches and levels of government and promote broad philosophical agreement. The NFCA have their own website located at www.nfcausa.org, which contains contact information for each of the 79 Fusion centers, a tool to submit a Suspicious Activity Report, and general news on the works of Fusion Centers across the country. =NFCA annual training event= The NFCA hosts an annual training event in Alexandria Virginia. Over 700 fusion center employees, federal and local partners come together to share innovative ideas and business practices for the purpose of enhancing fusion center capabilities and the National Network's contribution to public safety. The conference agenda consists of numerous breakout sessions, presentations and briefings on several topics related to public safety challenges and the domestic terrorism threat picture. Experts from around the country provide outstanding, in-depth instruction on a wide variety of topics to included cyber security, domestic terrorism, federal partner collaboration, private sector engagement, and social media monitoring. The event will also feature several keynote speakers from Federal Entities. Speakers in the past have included FBI director James Comey, former acting Secretary of DHS Elaine Duke, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. =History of the fusion center concept= The fusion center concept was created as a result of the September 11 report, in an attempt by the Department of Homeland Security to create better communication and cooperation between state, local, and territorial law enforcement with federal law enforcement entities including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security and several others. With domestic and foreign threats constantly changing, the strategies used by each Fusion Center have to be defined, and altered, which calls for a specific plans and guidelines as to how to best protect the homeland. The National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding, as well as The National Strategy for Information Sharing are two documents that influenced the workings of the Fusion Center network, and defined a broad strategy for a more proactive information sharing network. The NFCA alongside several other federal and local law enforcement associations formulated the \\"Baseline Capabilities for State and Major Fusion Centers\\" as well as the \\"National Strategy for the National Network of Fusion Centers\\" are documents that defined a clear understanding of the role of Fusion Centers as well as time sensitive goals they should achieve. The National Strategy is constantly being developed as time passes to meet the needs of the changing environment of national security. Additionally, a \\"Cyber Appendix\\" was added to the Baseline Capabilities document, that defines the roles and operational capabilities of Fusion Centers to fight cyber crime that effects their areas of responsibility. Success stories =Hurricane Irma= Hurricane Irma hit several of the Islands off the coast of the U.S.A., including the Virgin Islands. A couple from Falls Church, Virginia had been trapped in their vacation home near St. John due to damage from the hurricane. They had no means to escape their island, no electricity, and a limited amount of water. After their daughter found a video that a pilot had taken from above the island, she noticed the landslide that had trapped her parents in their home. She reached out to congressmen, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Red Cross, but the resources were not available to provide any assistance. Executive Director of the National Fusion Center Association Glenn Archer was alerted of the family's situation, and reached out to the Fusion Center in the Virgin Islands, and after working through the night the Director of the Virgin Islands Fusion Center was able to locate the couple and deploy an FBI SWAT team to their location. The operation was successful, and the couple was able to return to Virginia and be reunited with their daughter. At the time of the rescue, the couple had been trapped for 7 days, and had run out of potable water. Congressional reports The United States Congress in its oversight capacity has issued multiple reports on fusion centers in the United States. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a report in 2012 criticising the usefulness of fusion centers and practices. In a review of 13 months of fusion center reports, the Subcommittee found no examples of a fusion center uncovering a terrorist threat, and they criticized the use of reporting quotas for leading to a high rate of useless information being reported on by the centers. An example highlighted in the Senate report was a California fusion center report on the Mongols Motorcycle Club's distribution of leaflets to its members instructing them how to behave when stopped by police. According to the Senate report, the leaflet suggested to the Club members that they should be courteous, control their emotions and, if drinking, have a designated driver. One supervisor eventually killed the fusion center report, noting that \\"There is nothing illegal or even remotely objectionable [described] in this report,\\" and that \\"The advice given to the groups' members is protected by the First Amendment.\\" The Senate report argued that the report quality was diminished by the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis imposing a quota on the number of reports that must be filed by the fusion centers.Robert O'Harrow, Jr. \\"DHS 'fusion centers' portrayed as pools of ineptitude, civil liberties intrusions\\", The Washington Post, October 2, 2012. The report noted that of the 386 unclassified reports it reviewed, nearly 300 had no connection to terrorists or terrorism threats. The Senate committee estimated that about $1.4 billion had been spent on the fusion centers. Matthew Chandler, a spokesperson for the DHS, immediately denounced the Senate report in an interview with Fox News, in which he said that \\"In preparing the report, the committee refused to review relevant data, including important intelligence information pertinent to their findings,\\" and that the \\"report fundamentally misunderstands the role of the federal government in supporting fusion centers and overlooks the significant benefits of this relationship to both state and local law enforcement and the federal government.\\" A 2013 report by the House Homeland Security committee reported on visits to 32 of the 78 fusion centers and 9 committee hearings. The Committee found that fusion centers were an asset, but needed improved federal assistance to reach their full potential. The lack of a State-focused, national strategy for fusion centers was highlighted as a major barrier to the effectiveness of fusion centers. The report notes that fusion centers do not universally focus on the implications of intelligence for national security, and while fusion centers should fulfill their State and local missions, they must do so in a way that requires analysis with an eye towards counterterrorism. The Committee takes issue with the previous performance metrics which focused on quantity rather than quality of reports, and this inability to assess the quality of reports makes evaluating the value of fusion centers difficult. They point out that the uncertainty of annual budgets due to the funding structure makes long term planning difficult.Majority Staff Report on the National Network of Fusion Centers (2013). A 2017 report by the House Homeland Security committee reported on interviews with staff from 15 fusion centers and 68 responses to its survey of the 78 fusion centers. The report highlight the growth of fusion center operations since its previous 2013 report and highlighted particular challenges which threaten to reduce the effectiveness of fusion centers. The report highlighted the expanded efforts to include emergency personnel such as fire department and emergency medical services. Respondents to the survey raised concerns about their centers' limited access to unclassified and classified information, and the Committee critiqued the level of technical support offered to fusion centers in order to handle cyber threats. The report took issue with the recent decisions of social media companies to restrict access to their data by fusion centers. Criticism There are a number of documented criticisms of fusion centers, including relative ineffectiveness at counterterrorism activities, the potential to be used for secondary purposes unrelated to counterterrorism, and their links to violations of civil liberties of American citizens and others. One such fusion center has been involved with spying on anti-war and peace activists as well as anarchists in Washington state.\\"Report on Fusion Centers\\". Democracynow.org. July 29, 2009. David Rittgers of the Cato Institute has noted: > a long line of fusion center and DHS reports labeling broad swaths of the > public as a threat to national security.

Finally, the ACLU report argued that fusion centers were likely to engage in poorly contained data mining because the \\"Federal fusion center guidelines encourage wholesale data collection and manipulation processes that threaten privacy\\" and that the centers were \\"hobbled by excessive secrecy\\". An updated ACLU report in 2008 argued that the fusion centers were creating a \\"total surveillance society\\" in the US.ACLU Highlights Risk of \\"Fusion Centers\\", The Progressive, www.progressive.org/mag/mc073008a.html An ACLU spokesperson compared the fusion centers initiative with Operation TIPS because of the involvement of private Terrorism Liaison Officers.The New Snoops: Terrorism Liaison Officers, Some from Private Sector, The Progressive, www.progressive.org/mag/mc070208 =MIAC report= Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC) made news in 2009 for targeting supporters of third party candidates, Ron Paul supporters, anti-abortion activists, and conspiracy theorists as potential militia members.

Its first edition was published in 1920, and it has been published continuously since that date, becoming a daily paper in fall 1988. Since 2018, the newspaper has been published on Thursdays, with stories also published online throughout the week at http://www.technicianonline.com. The newspaper is funded by in-paper and online advertising and is a part of NC State Student Media. NC State's Student Media Board of Directors oversees NC State Student Media, which includes Technician, other student-led publications, and a college radio station, WKNC-FM. Notable alumni * Roy H. Park, media mogul, founder of broadcasting and newspaper chain Park Communications Inc. * William C. Friday (1941), American educator and leader of the University of North Carolina system from 1956-86. * Chris Hondros, photographer and 2003 finalist for the Pulitzer Prize * Richard Curtis (1972), a founder and managing editor of graphics and photography for USA Today * Joseph Galarneau (1989), chief operating officer for Newsweek Controversies Like many student newspapers, Technician has seen its share of controversies, including: * In 1990, the newspaper ran an editorial calling for the dismissal of embattled head basketball coach Jim Valvano. Valvano, a popular figure who led the team to the 1983 national championship, had come under fire for ethical and regulatory lapses in handling the basketball program. The editorial was resented as a publicity stunt. Valvano ultimately left the university under fire. * On September 3, 1992, a conservative opinion columnist harshly criticized African-American students' demands for a black cultural center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This column, paired with a front- page article with the headline \\"Black Students Vent Rage in Dining Hall\\"—a report on a NC State Student Government meeting to get feedback from African- American students on campus in a follow-up to recent events in Chapel Hill—resulted in widespread theft of the edition (it is distributed free). Students also burned copies of the Technician in the Brickyard in protest. The aftermath led to the creation of the university's African-American interest publication, Nubian Message. * Following disastrous Wolfpack basketball seasons in 1995 and 1996, Technician published staff editorials asking for the resignation or firing of coach Les Robinson. The editorials were timed to run on the eve of the ACC Tournament play-in game for last-place teams, which had become known throughout the conference as \\"The Les Robinson Invitational.\\" Robinson resigned following his team's loss at the tournament. Asked if he had any regrets at his farewell press conference, Robinson said, \\"Only that the school paper called me a loser.\\" * After new leadership took the helm at the paper in Spring 1997, several Technician editors and reporters were fired without just cause and escorted from the newspaper's offices by university public safety officers. Two months later, three of the fired editors used their inside knowledge of the production process to hijack the last edition of the paper for the school year, secretly inserting a full-column editorial criticizing the new editor-in-chief for using her power over personnel matters to settle personal scores and calling on university administrators to intervene. All 18,000 copies of the paper were distributed on campus the next morning containing the critical editorial, and the new student management was left unable to retract it until the resumption of publication the following semester. Technician's insulted editor-in-chief filed a report with public safety, which investigated the matter as a larceny. Despite dusting for fingerprints and questioning the former employees, investigators were unable to find any evidence against the suspected perpetrators and no charges were filed. * On August 29, 2005, a crowd of approximately 200 Greek Life and African American Student Advisory Council representatives gathered on Harris Field to protest a Technician article entitled \\"Sorostitutes are weak and wounded.\\" Students complained the article was an unfair representation of women's activities in Greek Life. While the event received a lot of media attention, it was quickly overshadowed by Hurricane Katrina's destruction on the Gulf Coast. * In January 2006, Technician ran an article by student contributor Jeff Gaither, stating that drunk driving was at times unavoidable and giving tips on how to avoid getting caught. The author subsequently wrote a retraction of the article. * In February 2014, Editor-in-Chief Sam DeGrave discontinued the traditional \\"Daily Tar Hell\\" satire newspaper while citing racist, sexist, and homophobic humor of past editions as his motivation for halting the ever-popular publication. Several students and alumni were unhappy with the decision and consequently sent a plethora of letters to the editor to voice their frustration. Many argued that the \\"hateful humor\\" was not prevalent in recent years and the satire was all in good taste while others were upset to see one of the few longstanding traditions of the university being tampered with. Very few wrote letters in support of the decision to discontinue the satire edition. DeGrave published a letter from the editor titled \\"One week in Daily Tar Hell\\", in which he condescendingly responded to his readers' criticism. Nonetheless, the \\"Daily Tar Hell\\" was later brought back into publication. Technician Editors-in-Chief 1919-1920 • vol. 1 • Marion Francis 1920-1921 • vol. 2 • J.H. Lane 1921-1922 • vol. 3 • E.C.

It may reflect the attitudes and preconceptions of an author, or the culture to which he or she belongs. The recognition and interpretation of unwitting testimony by historians acknowledges that primary sources may contain flaws as well as several layers of evidence, and that there are messages that are not explicit.  Origin  The phrase \\"unwitting testimony\\" was coined by the British historian Arthur Marwick of the Open University. Marwick acknowledged, however, that he had adopted and developed the concept from some earlier remarks made by the American historian of science, Henry Guerlac.Marwick 2001, p. 172. Marwick defined it as a feature of historical evidence to be distinguished from \\"witting testimony\\", which is the message of the primary source consciously intended to be conveyed by the author. Witting and unwitting testimonies can be applied both to the primary source itself or the historian who is constructing a secondary source. Unwitting testimony has been employed by historians to establish the beliefs and customs of past societies particularly in their interpretation of words and phrases, which tend to change meaning over time. The concept was also applied to film by Karsten Fledelius, referring to the incidental aspects of reality that slipped into the camera that were unwittingly recorded.

It provides feedback score sheets to enlisted members considered for promotion, which help members to focus on specific professional development needs. Selections for promotion to Master Sergeant (E-7), Senior Master Sergeant (E-8), and Chief Master Sergeant (E-9) utilize an integrated weighted and central selection board system. In addition to the weighted score, the central selection board evaluates each individual using the whole person concept. Board scores are determined by considering performance, leadership, breadth of experience, job responsibility, professional competence, specific achievements, and education. The board score is added to the weighted score to determine order of merit for promotion. Online score calculator The WAPS Promotion Score Calculator is used by enlisted airmen to estimate the minimum test score for promotion to the next enlisted rank. Users enter the promotion year, enlisted grade, their \\"Total Active Federal Military Service Date\\", date of their last promotion, EPRs, military decorations, and an estimate of the \\"Air Force Promotion Cutoff Score\\" in the Web page's form. The calculator displays the estimated score if the airman is eligible for promotion during the promotion cycle. Number of promotions Each year, The Air Force determines the number of promotions needed to fulfill mission requirements and manning goals as set forth by law and regulation. The Air Force then divides these slots by percentages across its various Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs), with a few career fields receiving a few extra slots. The result is a system in which each candidate for promotion only competes against those in the same Air Force Specialty (AFS). The numbers of promotion slots are not disclosed until after testing. Points Eligible candidates receive points based on a number of criteria, including awards and decorations, Enlisted Performance Report (EPR) points, Promotion Fitness Examination (PFE) points, and Specialty Knowledge Test (SKT) points. Fractions of points are awarded for certain categories, resulting in scores that are not whole numbers. Candidates with the highest numbers of points, up to the promotion allowance in each career field, are promoted. The score of the last person promoted is known as the cutoff. The cutoff can gauge how narrowly a given candidate missed a promotion. The cutoff score varies because of variations in both the number of promotion slots and the number of points earned by the top candidates. =Awards and decorations= For awards and decorations, a maximum of 25 points is allowed. Point values follow order of precedence. * 1 pt – Achievement Medal (all versions) * 3 pts – Commendation Medal (all versions) * 3 pts – Aerial Achievement Medal * 3 pts – Air Medal * 5 pts – Meritorious Service Medal * 5 pts – Defense Meritorious Service Medal * 5 pts – Purple Heart * 5 pts – Bronze Star * 5 pts – Airman's Medal * 7 pts – Distinguished Flying Cross * 7 pts – Defense Superior Service Medal * 7 pts – Legion of Merit * 9 pts – Silver Star * 9 pts – Distinguished Service Medal * 9 pts – Defense Distinguished Service Medal * 11 pts – Air Force Cross, Navy Cross, or Distinguished Service Cross * 15 pts – Medal of Honor (Note: Promotion to next highest grade usually will occur the first day of the month following awarding of MOH) =Promotion Fitness Examination (PFE)= The Promotion Fitness Examination is a test of material taken from the Professional Development Guide. It covers a wide range of US Air Force knowledge, including history, organization, regulations, practices, traditions, and customs. The number of PFE points awarded is equal to the number of correct responses out of the 100 items on the exam. =Specialty knowledge test (SKT)= The Specialty Knowledge Test is a multiple choice test consisting of 100 questions. Test material is taken from the Career Development Course (CDCs) and applicable Air Force instructions and manuals for each AFSC, as the SKT is specific to a candidate's AFSC. The number of points earned on the SKT is the number of points awarded toward promotion. Some members do not take the SKT. A common reason for this is that a candidate is performing a special duty and does not have CDCs. In other cases, candidates are in the process of retraining and have not completed the CDCs for the new role. Other candidates may not have access to their CDCs for one reason or another. When a candidate does not take the SKT, the PFE score counts again in place of the SKT. This is termed either \\"PFE only\\" or \\"SKT exempt\\". Taking the tests is known as \\"WAPS testing\\" or \\"promotion testing\\". Line numbers When promotions have been determined, a list is drawn up and each person is assigned a promotion sequence number, commonly known as a line number. The line number dictates the order in which candidates will be promoted, as if all of the promotees were waiting in a line. Line numbers are issued according to time in current grade, not by promotion scores, as is frequently perceived. Line numbers are assigned across the entire Air Force rather than by AFSC. Promotions begin in September and continue each month (on the first of the month) for 12 months for SSgts. TSgt and MSgt promotions start in August. Criticisms The promotion system has come under heavy criticism from all ranks in the Air Force. The primary complaint is that the EPR system has become \\"inflated,\\" with most average and above average individuals (including the stellar performers) receiving scores of five. Academic testing thus becomes a major deciding factor, which may not be a true indication of readiness for leadership and responsibility. Prior to the WAPS system, the entire promotion fitness was determined by the APR (Airman Performance Report) - the predecessor of the current EPR. These were also inflated to the point that anything less than a 9 (top rating at the time) would not get one promoted.

Contrary to the name and popular belief, the ramparts were not built by Romans during Trajan's reign, but during other imperial periods. Furthermore, the association with the Roman Emperor may be a recent scholarly invention, only entering the imagination of the locals with the national awakening of the 19th century. Medieval Moldavian documents referred to the earthworks as Troian, likely in reference to a mythological hero in the Romanian and Slavic folklore.Paolo Squatriti, \\"Moving Earth and Making Difference,\\" in Florin Curta (ed.), Borders, Barriers and Ethnogenesis, Tournhout: Brepols, 2006, pp. 63-64 The other major earthen fortification in Romania, Brazda lui Novac (Novac's Furrow), is also named after a mythological hero. Romania A variety of walls in Romania, Moldova and Ukraine There are three valla in Romania, in south-central Dobruja, extending from the Danube to the Black Sea coast. While the relative chronology of the complex is widely accepted, the exact dating of each fortification is currently under dispute. Scholars place their erection at different dates in the Early Mediaeval period, in the second half of the first millennium. In what regards the builders, two theories have gained acceptance, with supporters split, to a large degree, along national lines. Thus, Bulgarian historiography considers the fortifications were built by the First Bulgarian Empire as a defence against the various nomad groups roaming the North-Pontic steppes. On the other hand, several Romanian historians have tried to attribute at least part of the walls to the Byzantine Empire under emperors John I Tzimisces and Basil II, which controlled the region in the second part of the 10th century and throughout the 11th. The oldest and smallest vallum, the Small Earthen Dyke, is 61 km in length, extending from Cetatea Pătulului on the Danube to Constanţa on the sea coast. Entirely made of earth, it has no defensive constructions built on it, but has a moat on its southern side. This feature has been interpreted as indicating construction by a population living to the north of the earthwork, in order to protect itself from an enemy in the South.\\"The protobulgarians on the northern and the western Black Sea coast\\", p.187, D.Dimitrov, 1987. The second vallum, the Large Earthen Dyke, 54 km in length, overlaps the smaller one on some sections. It begins on the Danube, follows the Carasu Valley and ends at Palas, west of Constanţa. Its average height is 3.5 m, and it has moats on both sides. On it are built 63 fortifications: 35 larger (castra), and 28 smaller (castella). The average distance between fortifications is 1 km. The vallum shows signs of reconstruction. The last vallum to be built, the Stone Dyke, is also made of earth, but has a stone wall on its crest. It is 59 km in length, extending from south of Axiopolis to the Black Sea coast, at a point 75 m south of the little earth wall. The agger is about 1.5 m in height, while the stone wall on top has an average height of 2 m. It has a moat on its northern side and 26 fortifications, the distance between them varying from 1 to 4 km. The commune Valu lui Traian (formerly Hasancea) is named after the vallum. In the Northern part of Dobrogea, on South bank of Danube there was a wall, probably built by Trajan. The wall was constructed between today Tulcea and ancient town of Halmyris (60 km) on the East. The wall was discovered by means of aerial photographsIoana Oltean, A lost archaeological landscape on the Lower Danube Roman limes: The contribution of second world war aerial photographs, in Archaeology from Historical Aerial and Satellite Archives, Springer New York, 2014, 147-164 Moldova The remnants in Moldova comprise earthen walls and palisades. There are two major fragments preserved in Moldova: Upper Trajan's Wall and Southern (or Lower) Trajan's Wall. The Southern Trajan's Wall in Moldova is thought to be dated by the 3rd century, and built by AthanaricThe Goths By Peter Heather page 100 and stretches from Romania: Buciumeni- Tiganesti-Tapu-Stoicani and in after that another 126 km from the village of Vadul in Cahul district by the Prut River stretches into Ukraine and ends at Lake Sasyk by Tatarbunar. The Coat of Arms of Cahul district of Bessarabia, Russian Empire, incorporated Trajan's Wall. Some academics like Dorel Bondoc and Costin Croitoru think that it was done by the Romans, because -to be done- it required plenty of knowledge and workforce that barbarians like Athanaric did not have. \\"Problema Valurilor\\": Roman Walls in Moldova (in Romanian)Costin Croitoru, Sudul Moldovei in cadrul sistemului defensiv roman.

Elam Medes Achaemenid Era Oxus chariot model.jpg|A golden chariot made during Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BC). Achaemenid true extent.png|The Achaemenid Empire at its greatest extent. Persepolis Apadana noerdliche Treppe Detail.jpg|Right: Persian soldier. Left: Median soldier. Persépolis. La Garde.jpg|Persian warriors. The Achaemenid Empire (559 BC–330 BC) was the first of the Persian Empires to rule over significant portions of Greater Iran. The empire possessed a “national army” of roughly 120.000-150.000 troops, plus several tens of thousands of troops from their allies. The Persian army was divided into regiments of a thousand each, called hazarabam. Ten hazarabams formed a haivarabam, or division. The best known haivarabam were the Immortals, the King's personal guard division. The smallest unit was the ten man dathaba. Ten dathabas formed the hundred man sataba. The royal army used a system of color uniforms to identify different units. A large variety of colors were used, some of the most common being yellow, purple, and blue. But this system was probably limited to native Persian troops and was not used for their numerous allies. The usual tactic employed by the Persians in the early period of the empire, was to form a shield wall that archers could fire over. These troops (called sparabara, or shield-bearers) were equipped with a large rectangular wicker shield called a spara, and armed with a short spear, measuring around six feet long. Though equipped and trained to conduct shock action (hand-to-hand combat with spears, axes and swords), this was a secondary capability and the Persians preferred to maintain their distance from the enemy in order to defeat him with superior missile-power. The bow was the preferred missile-weapon of the Persians. At maximum rate of fire a sparabara haivarabam of 10,000 men could launch approximately 100,000 arrows in a single minute and maintain this rate for a number of minutes. Typically the Persian cavalry would open the battle by harassing the enemy with hit and run attacks - shooting arrows and throwing small javelins - while the Persian sparabara formed up their battle-array. Then the Persian cavalry would move aside and attempt to harass the flanks of the enemy. Defending against the Persian cavalry required the enemy infantry to congregate in dense static formations, which were ideal targets for the Persian archers. Even heavily armoured infantry like the Greek hoplites would suffer heavy casualties in such conditions. Enemy infantry formations that scattered to reduce casualties from the dense volleys of Persian arrows, were exposed to a close-in shock assault by the Persian cavalry. Torn by the dilemma between exposure to a gradual attrition by the arrows or to being overwhelmed by a cavalry charge on their flanks, most armies faced by the Persians succumbed. The major weaknesses of the typical Persian tactics were that proper application of these tactics required: a) A wide battlefield composed of fairly flat and expansive terrain that would not hinder the rapid movement of massed horses and where the cavalry could conduct proper flanking maneuvers. b) Good coordination between the cavalry, infantry, and missile units. c) An enemy inferior in mobility. d) An enemy lacking a combined-arms military. Most Persian failures can be attributed to one or more of these requirements not being met. Thus, the Scythians evaded the Persian army time and again because they were all mounted and conducted only hit-and-run raids on the Persians; at Marathon the Athenians deployed on a rocky mountainous slope and only descended to the plain after the Persian cavalry had reboarded their transport-ships - charging through the arrow-shower to conduct close- combat with spears and swords - a form of combat for which the Athenians were better equipped and better trained; at Thermopylae the Greek army deliberately deployed in a location that negated the Persians ability to use cavalry and missile-power, again forcing them to fight only head-on in close-combat and was forced to retreat only after the Persians were informed of a bypass that enabled them to circumvent this defensive position to defeat the Spartans; at Plataea the Persian attack was poorly coordinated and defeated piecemeal; Alexander the Great's Macedonian army that invaded the Persian empire was composed of a variety of infantry and cavalry types (combined-arms approach) that enabled it, together with Alexander's superior tactical generalship, to negate the Persian capabilities and, once again, force them to fight close- combat. Seleucid Empire (330 to 150 BCE) The Seleucid Empire was a Hellenistic successor state of Alexander the Great's dominion, including central Anatolia, the Levant, Mesopotamia, Persia, Turkmenistan, Pamir and the Indus valley. Parthian Empire (250 BCE to 226 CE) Parthian Empire at its greatest extent, c.60 BCE. Parthia was an Iranian civilization situated in the northeastern part of modern Iran, but at the height of its power, the Parthian dynasty covered all of Iran proper, as well as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Georgia, eastern Turkey, eastern Syria, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Kuwait, the Persian Gulf, the coast of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine and the UAE.Parthia (2): the empire The Parthian empire was led by the Arsacid dynasty, led by the Parni, a confederation of Scythians which reunited and ruled over the Iranian plateau, after defeating and disposing the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire, beginning in the late 3rd century BC, and intermittently controlled Mesopotamia between 150 BC and 224 AD. It was the third native dynasty of ancient Iran (after the Median and the Achaemenid dynasties). Parthia was the arch-enemy of the Roman Empire for nearly three centuries. After the Scythian-Parni nomads had settled in Parthia and built a small independent kingdom, they rose to power under king Mithridates the Great (171-138 BC).George Rawlinson, The Seven Great Monarchies of the Ancient Eastern World, 2002, Gorgias Press LLC The power of the early Parthian empire seems to have been overestimated by some ancient historians, who could not clearly separate the powerful later empire from its more humble obscure origins. The end of this long-lived empire came in 224 AD, when the empire was loosely organized and the last king was defeated by one of the empire's vassals, the Persians of the Sassanid dynasty. Sassanid Era (224 CE to 651 CE) The Sassanid Empire at its greatest extent. Reconstruction of a Sassanid-era cataphract. The birth of the Sassanid army dates back to the rise of Ardashir I (r. 226–241), the founder of the Sassanid dynasty, to the throne. Ardashir aimed at the revival of the Persian Empire, and to further this aim, he reformed the military by forming a standing army which was under his personal command and whose officers were separate from satraps, local princes and nobility. He restored the Achaemenid military organizations, retained the Parthian cavalry model, and employed new types of armour and siege warfare techniques. This was the beginning for a military system which served him and his successors for over 400 years, during which the Sassanid Empire was, along with the Roman Empire and later the East Roman Empire, one of the two superpowers of Late Antiquity in Western Eurasia. The Sassanid army protected Eranshahr (\\"the realm of Iran\\") from the East against the incursions of central Asiatic nomads like the Hephthalites, Turks, while in the west it was engaged in a recurrent struggle against its rival, the Roman Empire and later the Byzantine Empire, setting on forth the conflict that had started since the time of their predecessors, the Parthians, and would end after around 720 years, making it the longest conflict in human history. Islamic conquest (637 to 651) The Islamic conquest of Persia. The Islamic conquest of Persia (633–656) led to the end of the Sassanid Empire and the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Persia. However, the achievements of the previous Persian civilizations were not lost, but were to a great extent absorbed by the new Islamic polity. Most Muslim historians have long offered the idea that Persia, on the verge of the Arab invasion, was a society in decline and decay and thus it embraced the invading Arab armies with open arms. This view is not widely accepted however. Some authors have for example used mostly Arab sources to illustrate that \\"contrary to the claims, Iranians in fact fought long and hard against the invading Arabs.\\"Milani A. Lost Wisdom. 2004 p.15 This view further more holds that once politically conquered, the Persians began engaging in a culture war of resistance and succeeded in forcing their own ways on the victorious Arabs.Mohammad Mohammadi Malayeri, Tarikh-i Farhang-i Iran (Iran's Cultural History). 4 volumes. Tehran. 1982. Tahirid dynasty (821 to 873) Although nominally subject to the Abbasid caliphate in Baghdad, the Tahirid rulers were effectively independent. The dynasty was founded by Tahir ibn Husayn, a leading general in the service of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun. Tahir's military victories were rewarded with the gift of lands in the east of Persia, which were subsequently extended by his successors as far as the borders of India. The Tahirid dynasty is considered to be the first independent dynasty from the Abbasid caliphate established in Khorasan. They were overthrown by the Saffarid dynasty, who annexed Khorasan to their own empire in eastern Persia. Alavid dynasty (864 to 928) The Alavids or Alavians were a Shia emirate based in Mazandaran of Iran. They were descendants of the second Shi'a Imam (Imam Hasan ibn Ali) and brought Islam to the south Caspian Sea region of Iran. Their reign was ended when they were defeated by the Samanid empire in 928 AD. After their defeat some of the soldiers and generals of the Alavids joined the Samanid dynasty. Mardavij the son of Ziar was one of the generals that joined the Samanids. He later founded the Ziyarid dynasty. Ali, Hassan and Ahmad the sons of Buye [bu:je] (that were founders of the Buyid or Buwayhid dynasty) were also among generals of the Alavid dynasty who joined the Samanid army. Saffarid dynasty (861 to 1003) The Saffarid dynasty ruled a short-lived empire in Sistan, which is a historical region now in southeastern Iran and southwestern Afghanistan. Their rule was between 861 and 1003. The Saffarid capital was Zaranj (now in Afghanistan). The dynasty was founded by – and took its name from – Ya'qub bin Laith as-Saffar, a man of humble origins who rose from an obscure beginning as a coppersmith (saffar) to become a warlord. He seized control of the Seistan region, conquering all of Afghanistan, modern-day eastern Iran, and parts of Pakistan. Using their capital (Zaranj) as base for an aggressive expansion eastwards and westwards, they overthrew the Tahirid dynasty and annexed Khorasan in 873. By the time of Ya'qub's death, he had conquered Kabul Valley, Sindh, Tocharistan, Makran (Baluchistan), Kerman, Fars, Khorasan, and nearly reaching Baghdad but then suffered defeat.Britannica, Saffarid dynasty The Saffarid empire did not last long after Ya'qub's death. His brother and successor Amr bin Laith was defeated in a battle with the Samanids in 900. Amr bin Laith was forced to surrender most of their territories to the new rulers. The Saffarids were subsequently confined to their heartland of Sistan, with their role reduced to that of vassals of the Samanids and their successors. Samanid dynasty (819 to 999) The Samanids (819–999)Encyclopædia Britannica, Online Edition, 2007, \\"Samanid Dynasty\\", LINK were a Persian dynasty in Central Asia and Greater Khorasan, named after its founder Saman Khuda who converted to Sunni Islam despite being from Zoroastrian theocratic nobility. It was among the first native Iranian dynasties in Greater Iran and Central Asia after the Arab conquest and the collapse of the Sassanid Persian empire. Ziyarid dynasty (930 to 1090) The Ziyarids, also spelled Zeyarids (زیاریان or آل زیار), were an Iranian dynasty that ruled in the Caspian sea provinces of Gorgan and Mazandaran from 930-1090 (also known as Tabaristan). The founder of the dynasty was Mardavij (from 930 to 935), who took advantage of a rebellion in the Samanid army of Iran to seize power in northern Iran. He soon expanded his domains and captured the cities of Hamadan and Isfahan. Buwayhid dynasty (934 to 1062) The Buyid dynastyBusse, Heribert (1975), \\"Iran Under the Buyids\\", in Frye, R.

It lost its western territories to the Seljuqs in the Battle of Dandanaqan resulting in a restriction of its holdings to what is now Afghanistan, as well as Balochistan and the Punjab.

The Ilkhanate initially embraced many religions, but was particularly sympathetic to Buddhism and Christianity, and sought a Franco- Mongol alliance with the Crusaders in order to conquer Palestine.

Safavid Era (1501 to 1736) The Safavid Empire at its greatest extent. The Safavid rulers of Persia, like the Mamluks of Egypt, viewed firearms with distaste, and at first made little attempt to adopt them into their armed forces. Like the Mamluks they were taught the error of their ways by the powerful Ottoman armies. Unlike the Mamluks they lived to apply the lessons they had learnt on the battlefield. In the course of the sixteenth century, but still more in the seventeenth, the shahs of Iran took steps to acquire handguns and artillery pieces and to re-equip their forces with them. Initially, the principal sources of these weapons appears to have been Venice, Portugal, and England. Despite their initial reluctance, the Persians very rapidly acquired the art of making and using handguns. A Venetian envoy, Vincenzo di Alessandri, in a report presented to the Council of Ten on 24 September 1572, observes: Safavid Guns 17AD \\"They used for arms, swords, lances, arquebuses, which all the soldiers carry and use; their arms are also superior and better tempered than those of any other nation. The barrels of the arquebuses are generally six spans long, and carry a ball little less than three ounces in weight. They use them with such facility that it does not hinder them drawing their bows nor handling their swords, keeping the latter hung at their saddle bows till occasion requires them. The arquebus is then put away behind the back so that one weapon does not impede the use of the other.\\" This picture of the Persian horseman, equipped for almost simultaneous use of the bow, sword, and firearm, aptly symbolized the dramatic and complexity of the scale of changes that the Persian Military was undergoing. While the use of personal firearms was becoming commonplace, the use of field artillery was limited and remained on the whole ineffective. A painting on the wall of the Chel-Sooton Palace in Isfahan of Shah Abbas at war Shah Abbas (1587–1629) was instrumental in bringing about a 'modern' gunpowder era in the Persian army. Following the Ottoman Army model that had impressed him in combat the Shah set about to build his new army. He was much helped by two English brothers, Anthony and Robert Sherley, who went to Iran in 1598 with twenty-six followers and remained in the Persian service for a number of years. The brothers helped organize the army into an officer-paid and well-trained standing army similar to a European model. It was organized along three divisions: Ghilman ('crown servants or slaves' conscripted from hundreds of thousands of ethnic Circassians, Georgians, and Armenians), Tofongchis (musketeers), and Topchis (artillery-men) Shah Abbas's new model army was massively successful and allowed him to re-unite parts of Greater Iran and expand his nations territories at a time of great external pressure and conflict. The Safavid era also saw the mass integration of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Caucasians, notably Circassians, Georgians, Armenians, and other peoples of the Caucasus in Persian society, starting with the era of Shah Tahmasp I, and which would last all the way till the Qajar era. Originally only deployed for being fierce warriors and having beautiful women, this policy was notably significantly expanded under Shah Abbas I, who would use them as a complete new layer in Persian society, most notably to crush the power of the feudal Qizilbash. Under Abbas' own reign, some 200,000 Georgians, tens of thousands of Circassians, and 300,000 Armenians were deported to Iran. Many of them were, as above mentioned, put in the ghilman corps, but the larger masses were deployed in the regular armies, the civil administration, royal household, but also as labourers, farmers, and craftsmen. Many notorious Iranian generals and commanders were of Caucasian ancestry. Many of their descendants linger forth in Iran as the Iranian Georgians, Iranian Circassians, and Iranian Armenians (see Peoples of the Caucasus in Iran), and many millions of Iranians are estimated to have Caucasian ancestry as a following of this. Upon the fall of the Safavid dynasty Persia entered into a period of uncertainty. The previously highly organized military fragmented and the pieces were left for the following dynasties to collect. Afsharid Dynasty (1750 to 1794) Following the decline of the Safavid state a brilliant general by the name of Nader Shah took the reins of the country. This period and the centuries following it were characterised by the rise in Russian power to Iran's north. Following Nader Shah, many of the other leaders of the Afsharid dynasty were weak and the state they had built quickly gave way to the Qajars. As the control of the country de-centralised with the collapse of Nader Shah's rule, many of the peripheral territories of the Empire gained independence and only paid token homage to the Persian State. One of the branches of service to benefit most from Nader's reforms was by far the artillery. During the reign of the Safavid dynasty gunpowder weapons were used to a relatively limited extent and were certainly not to be considered central to the Safavid military machine.Rudi Matthee, \\"Unwalled Cities and Restless Nomads: Firearms and Artillery in Safavid Iran\\" in Safavid Persia: The History and Politics of an Islamic Society , ed. Charles Melville (London, 1996) Although most of Nader's military campaigns were conducted with an aggressive speed of advance which brought up difficulties in keeping up the heavy guns with the army's rapid marches, Nader placed great emphasis on enhancing his artillery units. A field cannon from the Afsharid period. The main centres of Persian armament production were Amol, Kermanshah, Isfahan, Merv. These military factories achieved high levels of production and managed to equip the army with good quality cannon. However mobile workshops allowed for Nader to maintain his strategic mobility whilst preserving versatility in the deployment of heavy siege cannon when required. Zand Dynasty (1750 to 1794) Qajar Era (1794 to 1925) Iran in the 20th century. Abbas Mirza. Two Royal Officers in Full Uniform, One of 274 Vintage Photographs. Brooklyn Museum. The second half of the 18th Century saw a new dynasty take hold in Iran. The new Qajar dynasty was founded on slaughter and plunder of Iranians, particularly Zoroasterian Iranians. The Qajars, under their dynasty founder, Agha Mohammad Khan plundered and slaughtered the aristocrats of the previous Zand Dynasty. Following this, Agha Mohammad Khan was determined to regain all lost territories following the death of Nadir Shah. First on his was the Caucasus, and most notably Georgia. Iran had intermittently ruled most of the Caucasus since 1555, since the early days of the Safavid Dynasty, but while Iran was in chaos and tumult, many of their subjects had declared themselves quasi- independent, or in the case of the Georgians, had plotted an alliance with the Russian Empire by the Treaty of Georgievsk. Agha Mohammad Khan, furious at his Georgian subjects, starting his expedition with 60,000 cavalry under his command, defeated the Russian garrisons stationed there and drove them back out of the entire Caucasus in several important battles, and completely sacked Tblisi, and carried of some 15,000 captives back to Iran. Following the capture of Georgia, Agha Mohammad Khan was murdered by two of his servants who feared they would be executed. The rise of the Qajars was very closely timed with Catherine the Great's order to invade Iran once again. During the Persian Expedition of 1796, Russian troops crossed the Aras River and invaded parts of Azarbaijan and Gilan, while they also moved to Lankaran with the aim of occupying Rasht again. His nephew and successor, Fath Ali Shah, after several successful campaigns of his own against the Afshars, with the help of Minister of War Mirza Assadolah Khan and Minister Amir Kabir created a new strong army, based on the latest European models, for the newly chosen Crown-Prince Abbas Mirza. This period marked a serious decline in Persia's power and thus its military prowess. From here onwards the Qajar dynasty would face great difficulty in its efforts, due to the international policies mapped out by some western great powers and not Persia herself. Persia's efforts would also be weakened due to continual economic, political, and military pressure from outside of the country (see The Great Game), and social and political pressures from within would make matters worse. With the consolidation of the Treaty of Georgievsk, Russia annexed eastern Georgia and Dagestan in 1801, dethroning the Bagrationi Dynasty. In 1803, Fath Ali Shah was determined to get Georgia and Dagestan back, and fearing Russia would march on more south towards Persia and the Ottoman Empire too, declared war on Russia. While starting with the upper hand, Russians were ultimately victorious in the Russo-Persian War (1806-1813). From the beginning, Russian troops had a great advantage over the Persians as they possessed much modern Artillery, the use of which had never sunk into the Persian army since the Safavid dynasty three centuries earlier. Nevertheless, the Persian army under the command of Abbas Mirza managed to win several victories over the Russians. Iran's inability to develop modern artillery during the preceding, and the Qajar, dynasty resulted in the signing of the Treaty of Gulistan in 1813. This marked a turning point in the Qajar attitude towards the military. Abbas Mirza sent a large number of Persians to England to study Western military technology and at the same time he invited British officers to Persia to train the Persian forces under his command. The army's transformation was phenomenal as can be seen from the Battle of Erzeroum (1821) where the new army routed an Ottoman army. This resulted in the Treaty of Erzurum whereby the Ottoman Empire acknowledged the existing frontier between the two empires. These efforts to continue the modernisation of the army through the training of officers in Europe continued until the end of the Qajar dynasty. With the exceptions of Russian and Imperial British armies, the Qajar army of the time was unquestionably the most powerful in the region. With his new army, Abbas Mirza invaded Russia in 1826. While in the first year of the war Persia managed to regain almost all lost territories, reaching almost Georgia and Dagestan too, the Persian army ultimately proved no match for the significantly larger and equally capable Russian army. The following Treaty of Turkmenchay in 1828 crippled Persia through the ceding of much of Persia's northern territories and the payment of a colossal war indemnity. The scale of the damage done to Persia through the treaty was so severe that The Persian Army and state would not regain its former strength till the rise and creation of the Soviet Union and the latter's cancellation of the economic elements of the treaty as 'tsarist imperialistic policies'. After these periods of Russo-Persian Wars, Russian influence in Persia rose significantly too. The reigns of both Mohammad Shah and Nasser al-Din Shah also saw attempts by Persia to bring the city of Herat, occupied by the Afghans, again under Persian rule. In this, though the Afghans were no match for the Persian Army, the Persians were not successful, this time because of British Intervention as part of The Great Game (See papers by Waibel and Esandari Qajar within the Qajar Studies source). Russia backed the Persian attacks, using Persia as a 'cat's paw' for expansion of its own interests. Britain feared the seizure of Herat would leave a route to attack India controlled by a power friendly to Russia, and threatened Persia with closure of the trade of the Persian Gulf. When Persia abandoned its designs on Herat, the British no longer felt India was threatened. This, combined with growing Persian fears about Russian designs on their own country, led to the later period of Anglo-Persian military co-operation. Ultimately, under the Qajars Persia was shaped into its modern form. Initially, under the reign of Agha Mohammad Khan Persia won back many of its lost territories, notably in the Caucasus, only to be lost again through a series of bitter wars with Russia. In the west the Qajars effectively stopped enroachment of their Ottoman archrival in the Ottoman–Persian War (1821–23) and in the east the situation remained fluid. Ultimately, through Qajar rule the military institution was further developed and a capable and regionally superior military force was developed. This was quashed by the then superpowers of the day: Russia and Britain. For World War I, see the Persian Campaign. Pahlavi Era (1925 to 1979) When the Pahlavi dynasty came to power the Qajar dynasty was already weak from years of war with Russia. The standing Persian army was almost non-existent. The new king Reza Shah Pahlavi, was quick to develop a new military, the Imperial Iranian Armed Forces. In part, this involved sending hundreds of officers to European and American military academies. It also involved having foreigners re-train the existing army within Iran. In this period a national air force (the Imperial Iranian Air Force) was established and the foundation for a new navy (the Imperial Iranian Navy) was laid. Following Germany's invasion of the USSR in June 1941, Britain and the Soviet Union became allies. Both saw the newly opened Trans-Iranian Railroad as a strategic route to transport supplies from the Persian Gulf to the Soviet Union and were concerned that Reza Shah Pahlavi was sympathetic to the Axis powers, despite his declaration of neutrality. In August 1941, Britain and the USSR invaded Iran and deposed him in favor of his son Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. Following the end of the Second World War, both countries withdrew their military forces from Iran. Following a number of clashes in April 1969, international relations with Iraq fell into a steep decline, mainly due to a dispute over the Shatt al-Arab (called Arvand) waterway in the 1937 Algiers Accord. Iran abrogated the 1937 accord and demanded a renegotiation which ended completely in its favor. Furthermore, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi embarked on an unprecedented modernisation program for the Iranian armed forces. In many cases Iran was being supplied with advanced weaponry even before it was supplied to the armed forces of the countries that developed it. During this period of strength Iran protected its interests militarily in the region: in Oman, the Dhofar Rebellion was crushed. In November 1971, Iranian forces seized control of three uninhabited but strategic islands at the mouth of the Persian Gulf; Abu Musa and the Tunb islands. In the 1960s as Iran began to prosper from oil revenues, and diplomatic relations were established with many countries, Iran began to expand its military. In the 1960s it purchased Canada's fleet of 90 Canadair Sabre fighters armed with AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles. These aircraft were later sold to Pakistan.Cached In the early 1970s the Iranian economy saw record years of growth thanks to booming oil prices. By 1976, the Iranian GDP was the largest in the Greater Middle East. The Shah (king) of Iran set about modernising the Iranian military, intent on purchasing billions of dollars worth of the most sophisticated and advanced equipment and weaponry through countries like the United States and the United Kingdom.Nixon, Kissinger, and the Shah: the origins of Iranian primacy in the Persian Gulf Iran's purchases from the United States prior to the Iranian Revolution in 1979 included: 79 F-14 Tomcats, 455 M60 Patton tanks, 225 McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II fighter planes, including 16 RF-4E reconnaissance variants; 166 Northrop F-5 Tiger II fighters and 15 Northrop RF-5A reconnaissance planes; 12 Lockheed P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft and two decommissioned and modernised American destroyers, ( and ). As of 1976 Iran had acquired 500 M109 howitzers from the United States, 52 MIM-23 Hawk anti aircraft batteries with over 2000 missiles, over 2500 AGM-65 Maverick air to ground missiles and over 10,000 BGM-71 TOW missiles. Furthermore, Iran ordered hundreds of helicopters from the United States, notably 202 Bell AH-1J Sea Cobras, 100 Boeing CH-47C Chinooks and 287 Bell 214 helicopters.history.navy.mil: USS Stormes 2.^ navsource.org USS Zellars Iran's purchases from the United Kingdom prior to the 1979 revolution included 1 decommissioned and modernized British destroyer (), 4 British-built frigates () and a vast array of missiles such as the Rapier and Seacat missile systems. Additionally Iran purchased several dozen hovercraft in the SR.N6 variety, 250 FV101 Scorpion light tanks and 790 Chieftain tanks. Iran also notably received much of their ground armored equipment from the Soviet Union. These deals were usually bartered using cheap oil and natural gas from the Iranian side in exchange for Russian expertise, training and equipment. In regards to military equipment Iran ordered ZSU-23-4 artillery vehicles, BTR 300 BTR-60's along with 270 BTR-50s and 300 BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launchers. The Imperial Iranian Army maintained the largest fleet of operational attack hovercraft in the world. These hovercraft's were obtained from various British and American companies and were later retrofitted with weaponry. In having this fleet the Iranian Army would be able to patrol shallow areas or the gulf and avoid minefields. The Iranian military never received many of the orders placed in the late 1970s due to the Iranian Revolution occurring in February 1979. The list below seeks to highlight some of the major orders that were placed prior the Iranian revolution but never were completed or delivered. In the late 1970s, Iran accelerated its orders from the United States in an attempt to outpace British, French and Chinese military orders. The Shah of Iran believed the Iran was destined to become a world super power, proudly led by one of the strongest militaries in the world. In regards to the Imperial Iranian Air Force from the USA in 1976 Iran placed for 300 F-16 Fighting Falcons, a further 71 Grumman F-14 Tomcats on top of the 79 that had arrived. All of these orders were due in 1980. In September 1976 Iran formally requested the purchase 250 F-18 Hornet, however this order would not have arrived until 1985. In addition to this in late 1977 Iran ordered 7 Boeing E-3 AWACS command and control aircraft and 12 Boeing 707 jets designed to refuel planes in midair. A massive order was made by the Iranian government in an attempt to modernize the Iranian Imperial Navy and give it capability to patrol the Caspian Sea, Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. The Iranian Navy had placed an order for 4 s equipped with Standard missiles, Harpoon missiles, Phalanx CIWSs and Mark 46 torpedoes, 3 used retrofitted s (these were transferred rather than sold to Iran from the American military) equipped with sub Harpoon missiles. In addition the navy sought to aquure 4 modified Spruance-class destroyers and 39 Lockheed P-3 Orion maritime reconnaissance planes for ocean surveillance and anti-submarine warfare. Unlike the air force the Imperial Iranian Navy did not solely rely on American equipment and used a wide variety of suppliers. From Germany, Iran ordered 6 diesel type 209 submarines due to arrive in 1980 designed to protect Iran in the Indian Ocean. From Italy, Iran ordered 6 s, capable of anti-submarine warfare and outfitted with Otomat missiles. In 1978 Iran ordered 8 s from the Dutch, each one equipped with Mk. 46 torpedoes, Harpoon missiles and Sea Sparrow anti-aircraft missiles. In the same year Iran sought to order a further four s (similar in design to the Korteaer class). Iran had entered discussions with Great Britain as early as the late 1960s to purchase a nuclear powered aircraft carrier that would give Iran amphibious attack capabilities in the Indian Ocean. While initially interested in purchasing one CVA-01 aircraft carrier, which was later on cancelled by the British, Iran expressed interest in the s. Talks were in place for Iran to purchase 3 modified versions of these carriers however no official record stands to prove that such an order was placed. From France, Iran ordered 12 equipped with Harpoon missiles. Of this order, approximately 6 were delivered and the subsequent 6 cancelled. During this same time-frame in the 1970s the Imperial Iranian Army was making several advancements and placing massive orders to keep up with other divisions of the military. To reinforce the ground troops the Iranians ordered 500 M109 howitzer's, 455 M60 Patton A3 tanks were ordered from the Americans. The largest order was placed from the British for 2000 Chieftain tanks, which had been specifically designed for the Iranian Army. Some other major equipment on order included hundreds of Russian BMP-1 outfitted with anti-tank missiles. In addition the Iranians sought to strengthen their position in the Strait of Hormuz by setting up missile sites in the close vicinity. When the Carter administration turned down Iran's request for nuclear capable missiles, they turned to the Israelis. They were working on the Project Flower ballistic missiles with Israel. In addition to these developments, the government of Iran had begun alongside American and British corporations to enter the licensed manufacturing of several different types of military equipment. Iran was very active in manufacturing Bell Helicopters, Boeing Helicopters and TOW missiles. As well many bases were under construction to house all of the military equipment. Two very notable and large bases that were to be built were in Abadan, where a massive infantry unit and airforce would serve to protect Iran from any Iraqi aggression, while the other in Chabahar was to house a port capable of housing submarines and aircraft carriers which would serve to allow Iran to patrol the Indian Ocean. At this time Iran was investing over $10bn in the construction of nuclear stations, 8 locations would be built by the Americans, 2 by the Germans and 2 by the French, for its 23,000 MW nuclear project which could produce enough uranium for 500-600 warheads.Nuclear Iran: The Birth of an Atomic State By David Patrikarakos Iran contributed to United Nations peacekeeping operations. It joined the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC) in the 1960s, and ten years later, Iranian troops joined the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) on the Golan Heights. =Gallery of Pahlavi-era service crests= Image:Imperial Iranian Ministry of War.svgImperial Iranian Ministry of War Image:Ground Force Imperial Army of Iran.pngImperial Iranian Ground Force (IIGF) Image:IIN-Seal.svgImperial Iranian Navy (IIN) Image:IIAF Seal.svgImperial Iranian Air Force (IIAF) Image:IIG Logo (Old).svgImperial Iranian Gendarmerie (IIG) Image:Iran Imperial Shahrbani.svgShahrbani Image:Imperial Guard of Iran.svgImperial Guard Islamic Republic of Iran =Under Khomeini (1979 to 1989)= In 1979, the year of the revolution in which Ayatollah Khomeini, who had been exiled by the shah for 15 years, heightened the rhetoric against the \\"Great Satan\\"Moin Khomeini, (2000), p. 220 and focused popular anger on the United States and its embassy in Tehran, the Shah's departure was consummated. The Iranian military thereupon experienced a 60% desertion from its ranks. Following the ideological principles of the Islamic revolution in Iran, the new revolutionary government sought to strengthen its domestic situation by conducting a purge of senior military personnel closely associated with the Pahlavi Dynasty. It is still unclear how many were dismissed or executed. The purge encouraged the dictator of Iraq, Saddam Hussein to view Iran as disorganised and weak, leading to the Iran–Iraq War. The indecisive eight-year Iran-Iraq War (IIW), which began on 22 September 1980 when Iraq invaded Iran, wreaked havoc on the region and the Iranian military. After it expanded into the Persian Gulf, where it led to clashes between the United States Navy and Iran (1987-1988), the IIW ended on 20 August 1988 when both parties accepted a UN-brokered ceasefire. On 26 August 1988, the UN published Security Council Resolution 620 because it was \\"deeply dismayed\\" and \\"profoundly concerned\\" that both Iran and Iraq had employed chemical weapons on an indiscriminate basis, and called =Under Khamenei (1989 to present)= Following the IIW an ambitious military rebuilding program was set into motion with the intention to create a fully fledged military industry. Islamic Iran has always striven to foster and develop the nuclear science industry it captured from the Shah. In 2002 George W. Bush tagged Iran with the label Axis of evil, and in 2003, the Proliferation Security Initiative was born. The IAEA became concerned around this time with Iran's potential weaponization of nuclear technology, and that led in 2006 to the formation of the P5+1 consortium, which signed in 2015 with Iran the now-imperilled JCPOA that was designed to prevent nuclear weaponization by Iran. Regionally, since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has sought to exert its influence by supporting various groups (militarily and politically). It openly supports Hezbollah in Lebanon in order to influence Lebanon and threaten Israel. Various Kurdish groups are also supported as needed in order to maintain control of its Kurdish regions. In neighbouring Afghanistan, Iran supported the Northern Alliance for over a decade against the Taliban, and nearly went to war against the Taliban in 1998. Under Khamenei, and especially in the decade from 2010, Iran has made no secret of its ambitions as a regional-class power. It was formally excluded from participation in the Iraq War (2003-2011). Its contention with the Saudi Arabia, especially as one of the sponsors of the Houthi rebellion in Yemen, and its military aid to Syria over the course of the Syrian Civil War mark it as a threat to the status quo Pax Americana, under which flourish minor Sunni Emirates along the West coast of the Persian Gulf. In September 2019, as joint military exercises with Russia and China in the Gulf of Oman and the Indian Ocean were announced, President Rouhani declared to America and the G7 Nations that =Gallery of Islamic Republic service crests= Image:Iran Chief of Staff of Armed Forces.svgHeadquarter of Iran Armed Forces Image:Seal of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army.svg|Iranian Armed Forces Image:IRI.Army Ground Force Seal.svg|Ground Force of Iran Image:IRI.Army Air Force Seal.svg|Air Force of Iran Image:IRI.Navy Seal.svg|Navy of Iran Image:IRGC-Seal.svg |Revolutionary Guards Image:Seal of the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Defense Force.svg Islamic Republic of Iran Air Defense Force  See also  * History of the Iranian Air Force * Military of Iran * Central Treaty Organization  References   Further reading   The Middle East: 2000 Years of History From The Rise of Christianity to the Present Day, Bernard Lewis, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1995. * Qajar Studies: War and Peace in the Qajar Era, Journal of the Qajar Studies Association, London: 2005.  * ","title":"Military history of Iran"},{"id":"4006787","text":"Seckford Hall, Woodbridge Seckford Hall is a Tudor period house in Seckford Hall Road, Great Bealings, near Woodbridge, Suffolk. In the same road are Seckford Golf Club and Seckford Farm. The hall is now a luxury hotel. The hall was constructed in the 1530s as the family home of Thomas Seckford. It is built of local brick in two storeys to an E-shaped plan with a 9-bay frontage. The hall passed down in the Seckford family until 1673, when it was bequeathed to Seckford Cage, after which it passed through several hands by purchase. A wartime stay after leaving school in 1915 inspired a teenage Enid Blyton. In May 1940 Sir Ralph Harwood purchased the neglected building from a demolition contractor, but it was soon afterwards commandeered by the Army for the duration of the Second World War. The property was returned after the war and early in 1946 Sir Ralph began to restore and modernise the property using materials rescued from other stately homes and churches. In 1950 the property was acquired by the Bunn family and converted to a first-class country house hotel and restaurant. The hotel is said to contain furniture that was once used in Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, including the chair that King Henry VII is said to have died on.

The festival welcomes nearly 15,000 attendees over the weekend. History The Lansing JazzFest began in 1995 when the Old Town Business and Art Development Association, having successfully produced OctoberFest (now the Old Town BluesFest), discovered that music festivals are an excellent way to encourage people to visit and enjoy Old Town Lansing. The local jazz radio station, 89.7 WLNZ, signed on as a founding media sponsor, and Message Makers, a local media company, became its founding business sponsor. In the festival's early days, local musicians donated their time to play at JazzFest, and volunteers from the local community pitched in to see that the 4,000-5,000 people in attendance had a good time. The Lansing JazzFest is the only mid-Michigan festival to increase consistently in attendance every year since its beginning. A virtual show is planned in September 2020 as live shows were cancelled caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

ZNS-TV's two transmitters, serving Nassau and Freeport, are the only over-the-air TV stations in the country. The rest of the country receives these channels (and a privately owned station) via Cable Bahamas, a privately held company that maintained an exclusive license to operate cable TV services until 2009. BCB also owns ZNS-1 AM Radio 1540 (a clear-channel station), its repeater, ZNS-1 on 104.5, ZNS-2 AM 1240, 107.9 \\"Inspiration 107.9 FM\\" in Nassau, and ZNS-3 AM 810 / FM 104.5 \\"Power 104.5\\" in Freeport. History Older ZNS-TV logo, with variant colors ZNS radio was founded in 1937 to broadcast hurricane warnings to the islands throughout the archipelago. At its inception, the station broadcast for two hours a day, featuring news and musical recordings from the BBC and Nassau sources. The radio station eventually established another transmitter in Freeport on the island of Grand Bahama. ZNS-TV launched in Nassau on New Providence Island in 1977. The station aired programming to entertain, educate and inform. It aired sitcoms, sports, dramas, and even movies. In 1992, the stations started to air only public affairs programming. In October 2010, the BCB implemented a major restructuring exercise in which approximately 80 employees were made redundant. This event sparked much public debate. The government offered a severance package to employees who separated from the company. One reason for restructuring was that the previous governments had declared the BCB to be a major strain on the public purse, bringing in little revenue. The further reason for the downsizing was to enable the corporation's transition to a public broadcasting service. The people behind the changes were then Minister of National Security with Responsibilities for Broadcasting, Hon. Tommy Turnquest, and the chairman of BCB, Michael Moss, along with his board and managers. Payouts were reported to cost the government around $4 million. Many of those who received separation packages and termination letters generally were unhappy, because it did not reflect their years of service. However, the government maintained that the separation package was generous, considering the economic climate in the country and that they were greater than required by law. In addition to the monetary payouts, those affected were provided with health insurance for 12 months. On December 14, 2011, ZNS-TV announced that it was planning on converting to ATSC digital terrestrial television, with the additional capability of adding a mobile DTV feed. In 2017, ZNS-TV shut down its on- channel repeater in Freeport, ZNS-TV-1 (also using VHF 13), and substantially reduced power at its remaining transmitter in Nassau.

She is a Ugandan lawyer, politician, diplomat, and model. She was the first female East African to be admitted to the English Bar. She is a paternal aunt of the King of Toro, Rukidi IV. She briefly served as minister of foreign affairs under Idi Amin from February to November 1974.  Early life and education  The Princess was born in 1936 to Rukidi III of Toro, the eleventh Omukama of Toro who reigned between 1928 and 1965. Her mother was Queen Kezia, a daughter of Nikodemo Kakoro, a senior chief. Her title from birth was Omubiitokati or Princess. After finishing elementary school from the present Kyebambe Girls' Secondary School, she was sent to Gayaza High School, a girls' boarding school in Buganda, followed by Sherborne School for Girls in England, where she was the only black student. \\"I felt that I was on trial and that my failure to excel would reflect badly on the entire black race,\\" she later wrote. After one year, she was accepted into Girton College, Cambridge, the third African woman to be admitted to the University of Cambridge in the institution's history. In 1962, she graduated from Cambridge with a law degree. Three years later, in 1965, the princess became a barrister-at-law, becoming the first woman from East Africa to be admitted to the English Bar.  Royal life and modelling  Around this time, her father died, and her brother Patrick was enthroned as Olimi III, the twelfth Omukama of Toro, who reigned from 1965 until 1995. At the coronation, Elizabeth received the title and office of Batebe (Princess Royal), which traditionally made her the most powerful woman in the Toro Kingdom and the most trusted adviser of the king. King Fredrick Mutesa II of Buganda, another of Uganda's traditional kingdoms, was now the president, with Prime Minister Milton Obote. Barely one year after the coronation of the Omukama Olimi III, Obote attacked the Buganda Palace, sending Edward Muteesa II into exile, and declared himself president. Soon, he abolished all Ugandan traditional kingdoms, including Toro. Elizabeth was afraid for her brother's life, but he escaped to London. Elizabeth later completed an internship at a law firm, and became Uganda's first female lawyer. She was a virtual prisoner in her own country until Princess Margaret of the United Kingdom sent her an invitation to model in a charity fashion show. The princess was a smash hit, and soon became a highly successful fashion model, being featured in many magazines. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis met Elizabeth at a party, and convinced her to move to New York City. In 1971, Obote was overthrown by General Amin, and Elizabeth returned to Uganda. Amin's rule was arguably even more repressive than Obote's, with Amin executing and imprisoning many people. In 1974, Amin appointed Elizabeth minister of foreign affairs.  Exile and return  In February 1975, Elizabeth escaped to Kenya, then to Vienna, then to London. Four years later, Elizabeth returned to Uganda to help with the country's first free national elections, which were won by Obote, who continued killing his enemies. Elizabeth and her lover, Prince Wilberforce Nyabongo, son of Prince Leo Sharp Ochaki, escaped to London in 1980 and married in 1981. In 1984, Elizabeth played the part of Shaman in the Columbia Pictures film Sheena: Queen of the Jungle Finally in 1985, Obote was overthrown and following a brief period of military rule, was replaced by Yoweri Museveni. In 1986, Elizabeth was appointed ambassador to the United States, a job she held until 1988. Later that year, Nyabongo, an aviation engineer, was killed in a plane crash at the age of 32. Following the death of her husband, Elizabeth opted to leave public service and get involved in charity work, in addition to being an official guardian of her brother's son, Rukidi IV, who was born in 1992 and has been the reigning Toro monarch since 1995. Following a period of service as Uganda's Ambassador to Germany and the Vatican, Elizabeth accepted an appointment as Uganda's High Commissioner to Nigeria.

These urinary symptoms may also occur with interstitial cystitis and following a radical prostatectomy. Outside the United States, PTNS is also used to treat fecal incontinence. PTNS can be used as a primary therapy. Treatment for overactive bladder and fecal incontinence may begin with pharmacological therapies before PTNS is administered. Unlike the variety of OAB drugs available PTNS is more effective and produces far fewer side-effects. Nearly 80% of patients discontinue use (mean of 4.8 months) of drugs within the first year with as high as 17% of discontinuation being due to adverse side-effects. Neuromodulation is emerging as an effective modality to treat patients who are not successful with conservative methods and its demonstrated efficacy has been the topic of multiple publications. Medical uses =Urinary incontinence= PTNS appears to be effective at improving the number of times a person who has overactive bladder syndrome needs to urinate, although the mechanism for this is unclear . It appears to work as well as medication, but with fewer side effects }. =Fecal incontinence= A meta-review that considered mostly low quality studies found tentative evidence of a benefit for PTNS in fecal incontinence . However, a more recent high quality study however did not identify a benefit . Procedure A patient sits comfortably with the treatment leg elevated. A fine needle electrode is inserted into the lower, inner aspect of the leg, slightly cephalad/rostral to the medial malleolus. As the goal is to send stimulation through the tibial nerve, it is important to have the needle electrode near (but not on) the tibial nerve. A surface electrode (grounding pad) is placed over the medial aspect of the calcaneus on the same leg. The needle electrode is then connected to an external pulse generator which delivers an adjustable electrical pulse that travels to the sacral plexus via the tibial nerve. Among other functions, the sacral nerve plexus regulates bladder and pelvic floor function. With correct placement of the needle electrode and level of electrical impulse, there is often an involuntary toe flex or fan, or an extension of the entire foot. However, for some patients, the correct placement and stimulation may only result in a mild sensation in the ankle area or across the sole of the foot. The treatment protocol requires once-a-week treatments for 12 weeks, 30 minutes per session. Many patients begin to see improvements by the 6th treatment. Patients who respond to treatment may require occasional treatments (~ once every 3 weeks) to sustain improvements. PTNS is a low-risk procedure. The most common side- effects with PTNS treatment are temporary and minor, resulting from the placement of the needle electrode. They include minor bleeding, mild pain and skin inflammation. Research and market approval The methodology was first invented by Dr. Marshall Stoller at UCSF Medical Center, San Francisco, and was first known as the SANS (Stoller Afferent Nerve Stimulator) protocol. In 2000, Dr. Stoller reported that 98 patients were treated with the SANS device with an approximate 80% success rate in treating urge incontinence syndrome, including urgency and frequency. Dr. Marshall Stoller's Guest Lecture On IC Network In a corroborative multi-center study by Govier, et al., 71% of patients achieved success. Additionally, in a study by Shafik, et al., 78% of patients achieved a long-term improvement in faecal incontinence when treated with PTNS. Regulatory clearances were based on these data. A PTNS device received FDA-clearance for urinary urgency, urinary frequency and urge incontinence in 2000; in 2010, the clearance was updated to include Overactive Bladder (OAB). A PTNS device received the CE mark for urinary urgency, urinary frequency and urge incontinence and fecal incontinence in 2005. Since 2005, Uroplasty has marketed the Urgent PC Neuromodulation System. In 2015, Medtronic acquired Advanced Uro-Solutions for its PTNS therapy, and began marketing the NURO PTNM System in 2016 U.S. reimbursement Effective January 1, 2011, the PTNS procedure will be billed under the new CPT code 64566,CPT copyright 2009 American Medical Association.

Highlights of the NICE guidance include: Evidence shows that PTNS is effective in reducing symptoms in the short and medium term. There are no major safety concerns. It can be offered routinely as a treatment option for people with overactive bladder provided that doctors are sure that the patients understand what is involved and agree to the treatment and that the results of the procedure are monitored. A NICE guidance for fecal incontinence is currently under review. Transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation Recent studies have been carried out to demonstrate the efficacy of transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation with the use of external electrodes. Electrodes are applied near to the ankle where the tibial/sural nerve is located. It is believed that the electrical stimulation can penetrate the skin delivering tibial nerve stimulation in the same way, but without the need for a needle electrode. It is thought that further studies on alternative possible treatments, such as home based transcutaneous stimulation, are needed. However, it has proved a viable and successful treatment for many.

Suffering a shortage of food, the renegade chief Inkpaduta (Scarlet Point) led 14 Sioux against the settlements near Okoboji and Spirit lakes in the northwestern territory of Iowa near the Minnesota border, in revenge of the murder of Inkpaduta's brother, Sidominadotah, and Sidominadotah's family by Henry Lott. The Sioux killed 35-40 settlers in their scattered holdings, took four young women captive, and headed north. The youngest captive, Abbie Gardner, was kept a few months before being ransomed in early summer. It was the last Native American attack on settlers in Iowa, but the events increased tensions between the Sioux and settlers in the Minnesota Territory. Nearly 30 years after the events, in 1885 Gardner-Sharp published her memoir, History of the Spirit Lake Massacre and Captivity of Miss Abbie Gardner,The Spirit Lake Massacre and the Captivity of Abbie Gardner (Expanded, Annotated, 2015, BIG BYTE BOOKS) which was reprinted several times in small editions. It was one of the last captivity narratives written of European Americans' being held by Native Americans. In 1891, Gardner-Sharp purchased the primitive family cabin and returned home. For the last 30 years of her life, she subsisted on the modest earnings from her book and souvenir sales. The town erected an historical monument to commemorate the attack. The State of Iowa now maintains the park and Abbie Gardner Sharp home site. Background Abbie Gardner Sharp, photographed decades after the massacre Inkpaduta led a small band of Wahpekutes who had been expelled from the main band in dissension following the murder of a chief in 1840. (Other major bands of Sioux in the region were the Wahpeton and Sisseton.) Including some women and children, his band followed the game and lived by hunting, whose yield was decreasing under pressure of new settlement. They also received some annuities under the Traverse des Sioux and Mendota 1852 treaties but never received the rightful amount owed by the United States for lands the Sioux were forced to cede.Roy Willard Meyer, History of the Santee Sioux: United States Indian Policy on Trial, Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1967, revised edition 1993, accessed 17 Oct 2010 By the terms of the Traverse des Sioux treaty, a reservation was set up along the Minnesota River, about 15 miles above Fort Ridgely. Promised improvements were not made on time and the federal government repeatedly failed to make adequate and timely annuity payments, even failing to authorize adequate budgets for the Department of Interior for this purpose. Provisions for education were not started for several years; only a few missionaries taught the Sioux bands. Lands were not adequately plowed for cultivation. Supplies were shipped too late and in inadequate amounts, to the point where the Sioux could not survive on them. By 1856, many Mdewakantons and Wahpekutes still came to the reservation just to get annuity payments, and returned to old hunting grounds to survive, especially during the winter. As they encountered more new settlers, conflicts arose. In a reorganization, in the summer of 1856 Charles A. Flandrau was appointed US Indian agent. Said to be an experienced trader and a man of integrity, he worked at improving conditions, but had much ground to make up. Many Sioux in addition to Inkpaduta's band were living off the reservation because of the government's failures.Meyer, Santee Sioux', pp. 90-98 Suffering food shortages during the severe winter of 1856–1857, which saw heavy snows, Inkpaduta and his band begged for food at European-American settlements in northwestern Iowa. Also struggling that winter, whites rebuffed the Indians with violence and a posse disarmed Inkpaduta's band after they killed a settler's dog that had bitten one of the band.Meyer, p. 98 They managed to acquire arms and retaliated by attacking settlements there and at Spirit Lake. In another account, the tribe was camped near current day Smithland, Iowa. Native people were sometimes beaten and chased for stealing livestock and scavenging grain in harvested fields; thus, weary of the group, who in turn \\"borrowed\\" community items freely if they could, a vigilante group from Smithland went out to their encampment. The group, including John Howe, Eli Floyd and Jonathan Leach, appropriated guns and told the tribe they would be back in the morning. The Indians broke camp that night. Defenseless, and hungry, the band moved north. Perhaps the first raid of the Spirit Lake Massacre came at Lost Island Lake, now near Ruthven, Iowa. A warrior of the group, who approached the Gillett cabin, was shot and decapitated while looking for food and rifles. As the tribe destroyed homes and lives on their journey, they came across Jowl Howe, who was also decapitated. The warriors killed 35-40 settlers, regardless of age or gender. Most of the victims were scalped.Keenan, Jerry. Encyclopedia of American Indian Wars, ABC-CLIO, Inc.: California, 1997, accessed 16 Oct 2010 The Sioux took four young women as captives, 14-year-old Abbie Gardner and three who were married, and headed back to Minnesota territory.Gardner-Sharp, Abbie. History of the Spirit Lake Massacre and Captivity of Miss Abbie Gardner, Des Moines: Iowa Printing, 1885 (reprinted 1892, 1910), accessed 16 Oct 2010 Word spread about the attacks, and the U.S. Indian Agent organized an armed militia of white citizens. Because of the heavy snows, a relief expedition from Fort Dodge failed to arrive in time to defend Springfield. Another expedition from Fort Ridgely in Minnesota pursued Inkpaduta and his band, but failed to catch them.\\"Spirit Lake Massacre\\", Encyclopædia Britannica, accessed 3 May 2010 While settlers demanded vengeance and rumors proliferated, the territorial authorities decided not to act against the Sioux until the captives had been returned. Settlers killed innocent Sioux who were caught hunting near them. When contact was made with Inkpaduta's group, the officials found that two of the captive women had been killed. In May the territorial legislature authorized a ransom, and a few days later two Wahpeton men brought in the third matron, Mrs. Margaret Ann Marble, for ransom. By the summer, Gov. Samuel Medary of the Minnesota Territory, and the Indian agent at Lac qui Parle ,\\"DICKINSON COUNTY: DESCRIPTION, From our Own Correspondent\\", Tour of Iowa Counties, Daily State Register, 4 May 1869, on Genealogy Trails, accessed 16 Oct 2010 completed negotiations for the ransom of Abbie Gardner, who was returned to Spirit Lake. During the summer, after struggling to marshal troops and attract allied Sioux warriors, the Indian Agency pursued Inkpaduta and his band, but most evaded capture. The Sioux refused to join another expedition. Aftermath This was the last attack of Native Americans against settlers in Iowa. Historians have considered it a foreshadowing of the Sioux uprising in Minnesota in 1862. The events worsened relations between the Sioux and settlers in the territory, with mistrust and fear higher on both sides. Whites reacted by attacking some innocent Sioux who were hunting near settlements. Because of competition over the lands, white settlers feared that the remaining free Indians would attack them, so they called for their removal by the US government. The Sioux resented the failure of the government to fulfill treaty obligations; they were starving due to inadequate rations and annuities at the reservations. By 1862, seeing thousands of children and elders die from starvation while whites broke the laws by seizing prime Sioux lands, the Sioux rebelled in what historians called the Sioux \\"Uprising.\\" Nearly 30 years later in 1885, Abbie Gardner-Sharp, by then married, published her short memoir of the 1856 attack and her captivity, entitled History of the Spirit Lake Massacre and Captivity of Miss Abbie Gardner.Abbie Gardner-Sharp, History of the Spirit Lake Massacre and Captivity of Miss Abbie Gardner, full text online at Archive Website, accessed 15 January 2011 Perhaps because the Indian Wars were over, the book was very popular and had several editions; it was reprinted in 1892 and 1910. This was one of the last works in the United States in the literary genre known as captivity narratives, dealing with the holding of European Americans by Native Americans. After years of marriage and living elsewhere, Gardner- Sharp returned to Spirit Lake in 1891 and bought her former family cabin. She operated it as a tourist site until her death in 1921, and sold her book, postcards and souvenirs there.\\"Abbie Gardner Sharp Cabin\\", Site History, State Historical Society of Iowa, accessed 16 Oct 2010 In 1895 the state erected a memorial monument to the settlers at Arnolds Park near the site. The area of the Spirit Lake settlement was later redeveloped as Camp Foster, a YMCA youth summer camp, where legends and ghost stories related to the events are recounted. Abbie Gardner Sharp Cabin The Abbie Gardner Sharp Cabin, where Gardner lived as a girl and which she later ran as a tourist attraction, still stands at Arnolds Park, Iowa. The state Conservation Commission purchased the cabin in 1941 and transferred it to the State Historical Society of Iowa in 1974. Under the guidance of architects and archeologists, it has been restored to its 1856 appearance. The park's visitor center features artifacts relating to the period, and to the cultures of both the Sioux and the European-American settlers.

First published in The Defence of Guenevere, and Other Poems in 1858, it is one of his best-known poems. Plot The poem is a grimly realistic piece set in France during the Hundred Years' War. The doomed lovers Jehane and Robert de Marny flee with a small escort through a convincingly portrayed rain-swept countryside, to reach the safety of English-held Gascony. They are however intercepted by the treacherous Godmar and have a last despairing parting besides the \\"old soaked hay\\" of the title. The encounter takes place shortly after the Battle of Poitiers but the characters Godmar and Jehane are entirely fictional. Morris used the name of an English knight Sir Robert de Marny, who was born in Essex and fought at Poitiers but who did not die in the manner recited. Text Three passages from the poem are most often quoted: The in medias res opening: Godmar's threat to Jehane if she does not become his mistress: And the forlorn conclusion, following Robert's brutal slaying by Godmar and his men: Criticism The poem succeeds because of its narrative pace, rather than ostentatiously-crafted language. It was one of the poems from Morris' early romantic period which were brought to the fore by historian E. P. Thompson (himself a published poet) in his 1955 biography of Morris.

The mall was opened in 1968 and was the sixth interior mall constructed in Greater Philadelphia. The Neshaminy Mall is anchored by Boscov's and AMC Theatres and has over 120 shops and eateries including a food court that was opened in 1989 and retailers including American Eagle Outfitters, Barnes & Noble, Foot Locker and Modell's. The Neshaminy Mall is directly across Bristol Road from Belmont, a historic home. The mall was named after the nearby Neshaminy Creek and features a unique fountain, which features of a waterfall, trees, plants and a statue of Tawank who was a leader of the Lenni Lenape Native American tribe. The world \\"Neshaminy\\" comes from the Lenni Lenape tribe's language. Location The Neshaminy Mall is located in Bensalem Township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. The mall is located off of the Pennsylvania Turnpike and U.S. Route 1. The Neshaminy Mall is accessible through SEPTA's route and Boulevard Direct bus routes. Across the street from the Neshaminy Mall is the Market Place at Neshaminy, which is a 350,000 square foot outdoor shopping center that has stores including The Home Depot and Target. Other nearby retailers and eateries include Walmart, Lowe's, Panda Express, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Bertucci's and Starbucks. History Plans to build the Neshaminy Mall were made in 1966, with Sears and Strawbridge & Clothier to be anchors. The mall was projected to cost $24 million. The Neshaminy Mall opened in 1968, developed by The Korman Company and Strouse Greenberg. The mall underwent an expansion in 1975. In 1977, the Lit Brothers store at the Neshaminy Mall closed as part of the chain closing all its stores in the Philadelphia area and was replaced by Pomeroy's. The Pomeroy's store became The Bon-Ton in 1987 after the chain was sold. A food court was added to the mall in 1989. In 1990, the Neshaminy Mall was purchased by Homart Development Company from Mutual of New York for over $50 million. The Bon-Ton closed in 1994. In 1995, the mall underwent a renovation that expanded the food court. In addition, Boscov's replaced the former Bon-Ton. The same year, General Growth Properties took over ownership of the mall after it acquired Homart Development Company. A 24-screen movie theater to be built at the mall was approved by Bensalem Township in 1997 after they had initially opposed the project. In 1998, the 24-screen AMC Theatres opened in the mall at a cost of $11 million. The Strawbridge's became Macy's in 2006 after Federated Department Stores acquired May Department Stores in 2005. In 2015, the mall began a small renovation starting with signage at mall entrances, the main sign and an expansion of the Boscov's. On January 4, 2017, Macy's announced that its store would be closing in spring 2017 as part of a plan to close 68 stores nationwide. Since the announcement was made, the Macy's closed in early April. As of late 2017, the Neshaminy Mall has seen a slow, but noticeable increase in the vacancy rate, likely to increase more due to the departure of the Macy's. On October 15, 2018, it was announced the Sears store would be closing as part of a plan to close 142 stores nationwide as a result of the company filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In July 2020, it was announced that medical offices would take over the former Sears building. In March 2020, the former Macy's store was sold to SANT properties, who plans to convert the space into mixed use. Also, at the corner of the Macy's parking lot, a Wawa is in the planning stages to be constructed.

Green indicates reduced expression. Cluster analysis has placed a group of down regulated genes in the upper left corner. In the field of molecular biology, gene expression profiling is the measurement of the activity (the expression) of thousands of genes at once, to create a global picture of cellular function. These profiles can, for example, distinguish between cells that are actively dividing, or show how the cells react to a particular treatment. Many experiments of this sort measure an entire genome simultaneously, that is, every gene present in a particular cell. Several transcriptomics technologies can be used to generate the necessary data to analyse. DNA microarrays measure the relative activity of previously identified target genes. Sequence based techniques, like RNA-Seq, provide information on the sequences of genes in addition to their expression level.  Background  Expression profiling is a logical next step after sequencing a genome: the sequence tells us what the cell could possibly do, while the expression profile tells us what it is actually doing at a point in time. Genes contain the instructions for making messenger RNA (mRNA), but at any moment each cell makes mRNA from only a fraction of the genes it carries. If a gene is used to produce mRNA, it is considered \\"on\\", otherwise \\"off\\". Many factors determine whether a gene is on or off, such as the time of day, whether or not the cell is actively dividing, its local environment, and chemical signals from other cells. For instance, skin cells, liver cells and nerve cells turn on (express) somewhat different genes and that is in large part what makes them different. Therefore, an expression profile allows one to deduce a cell's type, state, environment, and so forth. Expression profiling experiments often involve measuring the relative amount of mRNA expressed in two or more experimental conditions. This is because altered levels of a specific sequence of mRNA suggest a changed need for the protein coded by the mRNA, perhaps indicating a homeostatic response or a pathological condition. For example, higher levels of mRNA coding for alcohol dehydrogenase suggest that the cells or tissues under study are responding to increased levels of ethanol in their environment. Similarly, if breast cancer cells express higher levels of mRNA associated with a particular transmembrane receptor than normal cells do, it might be that this receptor plays a role in breast cancer. A drug that interferes with this receptor may prevent or treat breast cancer. In developing a drug, one may perform gene expression profiling experiments to help assess the drug's toxicity, perhaps by looking for changing levels in the expression of cytochrome P450 genes, which may be a biomarker of drug metabolism. Gene expression profiling may become an important diagnostic test.  Comparison to proteomics  The human genome contains on the order of 25,000 genes which work in concert to produce on the order of 1,000,000 distinct proteins. This is due to alternative splicing, and also because cells make important changes to proteins through posttranslational modification after they first construct them, so a given gene serves as the basis for many possible versions of a particular protein. In any case, a single mass spectrometry experiment can identify about 2,000 proteins or 0.2% of the total. While knowledge of the precise proteins a cell makes (proteomics) is more relevant than knowing how much messenger RNA is made from each gene, gene expression profiling provides the most global picture possible in a single experiment. However, proteomics methodology is improving. In other species, such as yeast, it is possible to identify over 4,000 proteins in just over one hour. Use in hypothesis generation and testing Sometimes, a scientist already has an idea of what is going on, a hypothesis, and he or she performs an expression profiling experiment with the idea of potentially disproving this hypothesis. In other words, the scientist is making a specific prediction about levels of expression that could turn out to be false. More commonly, expression profiling takes place before enough is known about how genes interact with experimental conditions for a testable hypothesis to exist. With no hypothesis, there is nothing to disprove, but expression profiling can help to identify a candidate hypothesis for future experiments. Most early expression profiling experiments, and many current ones, have this form which is known as class discovery. A popular approach to class discovery involves grouping similar genes or samples together using one of the many existing clustering methods such the traditional k-means or hierarchical clustering, or the more recent MCL. Apart from selecting a clustering algorithm, user usually has to choose an appropriate proximity measure (distance or similarity) between data objects. The figure above represents the output of a two dimensional cluster, in which similar samples (rows, above) and similar gene probes (columns) were organized so that they would lie close together. The simplest form of class discovery would be to list all the genes that changed by more than a certain amount between two experimental conditions. Class prediction is more difficult than class discovery, but it allows one to answer questions of direct clinical significance such as, given this profile, what is the probability that this patient will respond to this drug? This requires many examples of profiles that responded and did not respond, as well as cross-validation techniques to discriminate between them.  Limitations  In general, expression profiling studies report those genes that showed statistically significant differences under changed experimental conditions. This is typically a small fraction of the genome for several reasons. First, different cells and tissues express a subset of genes as a direct consequence of cellular differentiation so many genes are turned off. Second, many of the genes code for proteins that are required for survival in very specific amounts so many genes do not change. Third, cells use many other mechanisms to regulate proteins in addition to altering the amount of mRNA, so these genes may stay consistently expressed even when protein concentrations are rising and falling. Fourth, financial constraints limit expression profiling experiments to a small number of observations of the same gene under identical conditions, reducing the statistical power of the experiment, making it impossible for the experiment to identify important but subtle changes. Finally, it takes a great amount of effort to discuss the biological significance of each regulated gene, so scientists often limit their discussion to a subset. Newer microarray analysis techniques automate certain aspects of attaching biological significance to expression profiling results, but this remains a very difficult problem. The relatively short length of gene lists published from expression profiling experiments limits the extent to which experiments performed in different laboratories appear to agree. Placing expression profiling results in a publicly accessible microarray database makes it possible for researchers to assess expression patterns beyond the scope of published results, perhaps identifying similarity with their own work.  Validation of high throughput measurements  Both DNA microarrays and quantitative PCR exploit the preferential binding or \\"base pairing\\" of complementary nucleic acid sequences, and both are used in gene expression profiling, often in a serial fashion. While high throughput DNA microarrays lack the quantitative accuracy of qPCR, it takes about the same time to measure the gene expression of a few dozen genes via qPCR as it would to measure an entire genome using DNA microarrays. So it often makes sense to perform semi-quantitative DNA microarray analysis experiments to identify candidate genes, then perform qPCR on some of the most interesting candidate genes to validate the microarray results. Other experiments, such as a Western blot of some of the protein products of differentially expressed genes, make conclusions based on the expression profile more persuasive, since the mRNA levels do not necessarily correlate to the amount of expressed protein.  Statistical analysis  Data analysis of microarrays has become an area of intense research. Simply stating that a group of genes were regulated by at least twofold, once a common practice, lacks a solid statistical footing. With five or fewer replicates in each group, typical for microarrays, a single outlier observation can create an apparent difference greater than two-fold. In addition, arbitrarily setting the bar at two-fold is not biologically sound, as it eliminates from consideration many genes with obvious biological significance. Rather than identify differentially expressed genes using a fold change cutoff, one can use a variety of statistical tests or omnibus tests such as ANOVA, all of which consider both fold change and variability to create a p-value, an estimate of how often we would observe the data by chance alone. Applying p-values to microarrays is complicated by the large number of multiple comparisons (genes) involved. For example, a p-value of 0.05 is typically thought to indicate significance, since it estimates a 5% probability of observing the data by chance. But with 10,000 genes on a microarray, 500 genes would be identified as significant at p < 0.05 even if there were no difference between the experimental groups. One obvious solution is to consider significant only those genes meeting a much more stringent p value criterion, e.g., one could perform a Bonferroni correction on the p-values, or use a false discovery rate calculation to adjust p-values in proportion to the number of parallel tests involved. Unfortunately, these approaches may reduce the number of significant genes to zero, even when genes are in fact differentially expressed. Current statistics such as Rank products aim to strike a balance between false discovery of genes due to chance variation and non-discovery of differentially expressed genes. Commonly cited methods include the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) and a wide variety of methods are available from Bioconductor and a variety of analysis packages from bioinformatics companies. Selecting a different test usually identifies a different list of significant genes since each test operates under a specific set of assumptions, and places a different emphasis on certain features in the data. Many tests begin with the assumption of a normal distribution in the data, because that seems like a sensible starting point and often produces results that appear more significant. Some tests consider the joint distribution of all gene observations to estimate general variability in measurements, while others look at each gene in isolation. Many modern microarray analysis techniques involve bootstrapping (statistics), machine learning or Monte Carlo methods. As the number of replicate measurements in a microarray experiment increases, various statistical approaches yield increasingly similar results, but lack of concordance between different statistical methods makes array results appear less trustworthy. The MAQC Project makes recommendations to guide researchers in selecting more standard methods (e.g. using p-value and fold-change together for selecting the differentially expressed genes) so that experiments performed in different laboratories will agree better. Different from the analysis on differentially expressed individual genes, another type of analysis focuses on differential expression or perturbation of pre-defined gene sets and is called gene set analysis. Gene set analysis demonstrated several major advantages over individual gene differential expression analysis. Gene sets are groups of genes that are functionally related according to current knowledge. Therefore, gene set analysis is considered a knowledge based analysis approach. Commonly used gene sets include those derived from KEGG pathways, Gene Ontology terms, gene groups that share some other functional annotations, such as common transcriptional regulators etc. Representative gene set analysis methods include Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), which estimates significance of gene sets based on permutation of sample labels, and Generally Applicable Gene-set Enrichment (GAGE), which tests the significance of gene sets based on permutation of gene labels or a parametric distribution.  Gene annotation  While the statistics may identify which gene products change under experimental conditions, making biological sense of expression profiling rests on knowing which protein each gene product makes and what function this protein performs. Gene annotation provides functional and other information, for example the location of each gene within a particular chromosome. Some functional annotations are more reliable than others; some are absent. Gene annotation databases change regularly, and various databases refer to the same protein by different names, reflecting a changing understanding of protein function. Use of standardized gene nomenclature helps address the naming aspect of the problem, but exact matching of transcripts to genes remains an important consideration.  Categorizing regulated genes  Having identified some set of regulated genes, the next step in expression profiling involves looking for patterns within the regulated set. Do the proteins made from these genes perform similar functions? Are they chemically similar? Do they reside in similar parts of the cell? Gene ontology analysis provides a standard way to define these relationships. Gene ontologies start with very broad categories, e.g., \\"metabolic process\\" and break them down into smaller categories, e.g., \\"carbohydrate metabolic process\\" and finally into quite restrictive categories like \\"inositol and derivative phosphorylation\\". Genes have other attributes beside biological function, chemical properties and cellular location. One can compose sets of genes based on proximity to other genes, association with a disease, and relationships with drugs or toxins. The Molecular Signatures Database and the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database are examples of resources to categorize genes in numerous ways.  Finding patterns among regulated genes  Ingenuity Gene Network Diagram which dynamically assembles genes with known relationships. Green indicates reduced expression, red indicates increased expression. The algorithm has included unregulated genes, white, to improve connectivity. Regulated genes are categorized in terms of what they are and what they do, important relationships between genes may emerge. For example, we might see evidence that a certain gene creates a protein to make an enzyme that activates a protein to turn on a second gene on our list. This second gene may be a transcription factor that regulates yet another gene from our list. Observing these links we may begin to suspect that they represent much more than chance associations in the results, and that they are all on our list because of an underlying biological process. On the other hand, it could be that if one selected genes at random, one might find many that seem to have something in common. In this sense, we need rigorous statistical procedures to test whether the emerging biological themes is significant or not. That is where gene set analysis comes in. = Cause and effect relationships = Fairly straightforward statistics provide estimates of whether associations between genes on lists are greater than what one would expect by chance. These statistics are interesting, even if they represent a substantial oversimplification of what is really going on. Here is an example. Suppose there are 10,000 genes in an experiment, only 50 (0.5%) of which play a known role in making cholesterol. The experiment identifies 200 regulated genes. Of those, 40 (20%) turn out to be on a list of cholesterol genes as well. Based on the overall prevalence of the cholesterol genes (0.5%) one expects an average of 1 cholesterol gene for every 200 regulated genes, that is, 0.005 times 200. This expectation is an average, so one expects to see more than one some of the time. The question becomes how often we would see 40 instead of 1 due to pure chance. According to the hypergeometric distribution, one would expect to try about 10^57 times (10 followed by 56 zeroes) before picking 39 or more of the cholesterol genes from a pool of 10,000 by drawing 200 genes at random. Whether one pays much attention to how infinitesimally small the probability of observing this by chance is, one would conclude that the regulated gene list is enriched in genes with a known cholesterol association. One might further hypothesize that the experimental treatment regulates cholesterol, because the treatment seems to selectively regulate genes associated with cholesterol. While this may be true, there are a number of reasons why making this a firm conclusion based on enrichment alone represents an unwarranted leap of faith. One previously mentioned issue has to do with the observation that gene regulation may have no direct impact on protein regulation: even if the proteins coded for by these genes do nothing other than make cholesterol, showing that their mRNA is altered does not directly tell us what is happening at the protein level. It is quite possible that the amount of these cholesterol-related proteins remains constant under the experimental conditions. Second, even if protein levels do change, perhaps there is always enough of them around to make cholesterol as fast as it can be possibly made, that is, another protein, not on our list, is the rate determining step in the process of making cholesterol. Finally, proteins typically play many roles, so these genes may be regulated not because of their shared association with making cholesterol but because of a shared role in a completely independent process. Bearing the foregoing caveats in mind, while gene profiles do not in themselves prove causal relationships between treatments and biological effects, they do offer unique biological insights that would often be very difficult to arrive at in other ways. = Using patterns to find regulated genes = As described above, one can identify significantly regulated genes first and then find patterns by comparing the list of significant genes to sets of genes known to share certain associations. One can also work the problem in reverse order. Here is a very simple example. Suppose there are 40 genes associated with a known process, for example, a predisposition to diabetes. Looking at two groups of expression profiles, one for mice fed a high carbohydrate diet and one for mice fed a low carbohydrate diet, one observes that all 40 diabetes genes are expressed at a higher level in the high carbohydrate group than the low carbohydrate group. Regardless of whether any of these genes would have made it to a list of significantly altered genes, observing all 40 up, and none down appears unlikely to be the result of pure chance: flipping 40 heads in a row is predicted to occur about one time in a trillion attempts using a fair coin. For a type of cell, the group of genes whose combined expression pattern is uniquely characteristic to a given condition constitutes the gene signature of this condition. Ideally, the gene signature can be used to select a group of patients at a specific state of a disease with accuracy that facilitates selection of treatments. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and similar methods take advantage of this kind of logic but uses more sophisticated statistics, because component genes in real processes display more complex behavior than simply moving up or down as a group, and the amount the genes move up and down is meaningful, not just the direction. In any case, these statistics measure how different the behavior of some small set of genes is compared to genes not in that small set. GSEA uses a Kolmogorov Smirnov style statistic to see whether any previously defined gene sets exhibited unusual behavior in the current expression profile. This leads to a multiple hypothesis testing challenge, but reasonable methods exist to address it.  Conclusions  Expression profiling provides new information about what genes do under various conditions. Overall, microarray technology produces reliable expression profiles. From this information one can generate new hypotheses about biology or test existing ones. However, the size and complexity of these experiments often results in a wide variety of possible interpretations. In many cases, analyzing expression profiling results takes far more effort than performing the initial experiments. Most researchers use multiple statistical methods and exploratory data analysis before publishing their expression profiling results, coordinating their efforts with a bioinformatician or other expert in DNA microarrays. Good experimental design, adequate biological replication and follow up experiments play key roles in successful expression profiling experiments.

Each May, about 300 middle to high school instrumentalists go through one or more auditions for places in the ASYO (the minimum age requirement is 13, though exceptions are made). Only about 100 will be selected to participate in the season.  The youth orchestra  In 1974, the Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra was created as a subsidiary of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, a practice that is relatively rare for American orchestras. However, this arrangement worked for the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra since it began as a youth ensemble itself, the Atlanta Youth Symphony of 1944-47. Thirty years after the start of the Atlanta Youth Symphony, the Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra was formed, first directed under Michael Palmer, Associate Conductor of the ASO. Sung Kwak was the successor to Michael Palmer as conductor of the orchestra and conducted for two years. From 1979 to 2014, Jere Flint was the conductor of the orchestra. From 2014 to 2017, Joseph Young was the conductor. Stephen Mulligan has been the conductor since 2017.. Members of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra often work with members of the youth orchestra during Saturday rehearsals. This program has been in effect since orchestra was founded. More than 50 ASO players have served as ASYO coaches.  Concerts  Each season, the Youth Orchestra performs at least three subscription concerts, in addition to annual Kids' Holiday concerts and a Family Concert. At least one concert each season features Youth Orchestra soloists selected through an annual Concerto Competition. Another annual competition, the Scholarship Auditions, reward the winners with scholarships which are used to further musical studies at summer camps, colleges and conservatories. The Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra promotes the arts and arts education in the Atlanta community, and it performs an annual concert for the Atlanta Ministry with International Students. Occasionally, the Youth Orchestra performs large symphonic-choral works in concerts with local high school chorus members as a part of the Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra Chorus. As of the 2006-2007 season, the last time this occurred was May 2002. The ASYO also commissions works by local and national composers. The ASYO has hosted or exchanged visits with youth orchestras from Great Britain, Australia, and Berlin, Germany. During the 1996 Cultural Olympiad, the Youth Orchestra performed to sold-out audiences. The Youth Orchestra was also the featured orchestra at the Closing Ceremonies of the 1996 Olympic Games and broadcast worldwide. Four concerts of recent performances have been highlighted on National Public Radio's \\"Performance Today\\" series. In addition to that, ASYO concerts are replayed on local radio station WABE FM-90.1. The Youth Orchestra was invited to perform for the Georgia Music Educators Association in January 2005. In April 2005, the Youth Orchestra performed and recorded two live concerts with Atlanta rock band Collective Soul. They are showcased in the DVD Home: A Live Concert Recording With The Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra. Other guest artists including Jennifer Larmore, Jami Rogers, and Andrés Díaz have performed with the Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra. Guest conductors Robert Shaw, Yoel Levi, Mark Waters, Michael Kamen, Alexander Mickelthwate, Donald Runnicles, and Robert Spano have also conducted the Youth Orchestra. A number of the Youth Orchestra's members have gone on to study music in conservatories and university music departments and pursue careers in music, as teachers and performers.

He is especially noted for introducing a new style into Kashmiri poetry and for expanding Kashmiri poetry into previously unexplored thematic realms. In addition to his poems in Kashmiri, Mahjoor is also noted for his poetic compositions in Persian and Urdu.  Early life  Mahjoor was born in the village of Mitrigam, Pulwama, 38 km from Srinagar and 5 km from Pulwama. He got his pen name Mahjoor when he visited Punjab and started writing poetry under the influence of great Urdu poet, Shibli Namani. He followed in the academic footsteps of his father, who was a scholar of Persian language. He received the primary education from the Maktab of Aashiq Trali (a renowned poet) in Tral. After passing the middle school examination from Nusrat-ul-Islam School, Srinagar, he went to Punjab where he came in contact with Urdu poets like Bismil Amritsari and Moulana Shibi Nomani. He returned to Srinagar in 1908 and started writing in Persian and then in Urdu. Determined to write in his native language, Mahjoor used the simple diction of traditional folk storytellers in his writing. Mahjoor worked as a patwari (regional administrator) in Kashmir. Along with his official duties, he spent his free time writing poetry, and his first Kashmiri poem 'Vanta hay vesy' was published in 1918. Poetic legacy Many of the themes of the poetry of Mahjoor involved freedom and progress in Kashmir, and his poems awakened latent nationalism among Kashmiris. His popular verses engaged such topics as love, communal harmony, social reform, and the plight of the Kashmiris. He also wrote on such timeless themes as youth, the flowers of Nishat Garden, peasant girls, gardeners, and the golden oriole. At that time, such songs were unknown in formal Kashmiri poetry. Mahjoor is also recognized as a poet who revolutionized the traditional forms of nazm and ghazal. In 1972, a bilingual film named Shayar-e-Kashmir Mahjoor was released with the Hindi version starring Balraj Sahni. A square in Srinagar is named after him. He is buried near the poet Habba Khatoon at a site near Athwajan on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway. A song featured in Coke Studio Explorer, \\"Ha Gulo\\" is written by Mahjoor and was sung by Kashmiri regional band Qasamir. Bibliography * Ghulam Ahmad Mahjoor. Poems of Mahjoor.

Specifically, the problem is due to left common iliac vein compression by the overlying right common iliac artery. This leads to stasis of blood, which predisposes to the formation of blood clots. Uncommon variations of MTS have been described, such as the right common iliac vein getting compressed by the right common iliac artery. In the 21st century the May–Thurner syndrome definition has been expanded to a broader disease profile known as nonthrombotic iliac vein lesions (NIVL) which can involve both the right and left iliac veins as well as multiple other named venous segments. This syndrome frequently manifests as pain when the limb is dependent (hanging down the edge of a bed/chair) and/or significant swelling of the whole limb. Mechanism In contrast to the right common iliac vein, which ascends almost vertically to the inferior vena cava, the left common iliac vein traverses diagonally from left to right to enter the inferior vena cava. Along this course, it goes under the right common iliac artery, which may compress it against the lumbar spine and limit the flow of blood out of the left leg. There are case reports of the inferior vena cava being compressed by the iliac arteries or right-sided compression syndromes, but the vast majority are on the left side. While this is the suspected cause of the syndrome, the left iliac vein is frequently seen to be compressed in asymptomatic patients, and considered an anatomic variant- a 50% luminal compression of the left iliac vein occurs in a quarter of healthy individuals. Compression becomes clinically significant only if it causes appreciable hemodynamic changes in venous flow or venous pressure, or if it leads to acute or chronic DVT. In addition to compression, the vein develops intraluminal fibrous spurs from the effects of the chronic pulsatile compressive force from the artery. The narrowed turbulent channel predisposes the patient to thrombosis. The compromised blood flow often causes collateral blood vessels to form. These are most often horizontal transpelvis collaterals, connecting both internal iliac veins, thus creating outflow through the right common iliac vein. Sometimes vertical collaterals are formed, most often paralumbar, which can cause neurological symptoms, like tingling and numbness. This compressed, narrowed outflow channel causes stasis of the blood, which is one element of Virchow's triad that precipitates deep vein thrombosis. Diagnosis It is important to consider May–Thurner syndrome in patients who have no other obvious reason for hypercoagulability and who present with left lower extremity thrombosis. To rule out other causes for hypercoagulation, it may be appropriate to check the antithrombin, protein C, protein S, factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, and antiphospholipid antibodies. Venography will demonstrate the classical syndrome when causing deep venous thrombosis. May–Thurner syndrome in the broader disease profile known as nonthrombotic iliac vein lesions (NIVLs) exists in the symptomatic ambulatory patient and these lesions are usually not seen by venography. Morphologically, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has emerged as the best current tool in the broader sense.Neglén P, Raju S.J (2002) Intravascular ultrasound scan evaluation of the obstructed vein. Vasc Surg. 2002 Apr;35(4):694-700. Functional testing such as duplex ultrasound, venous and interstitial pressure measurement and plethysmography may sometimes be beneficial. Compression of the left common iliac vein may be seen on pelvic CT. Treatment Management of the underlying defect is proportional to the severity of the clinical presentation. Leg swelling and pain is best evaluated by vascular specialists (vascular surgeons, interventional cardiologists, interventional radiologists) who both diagnose and treat arterial and venous diseases to ensure that the cause of the extremity pain is evaluated. The diagnosis needs to be confirmed with some sort of imaging that may include magnetic resonance venography, venogram and usually confirmed with intravascular ultrasound because the flattened vein may not be noticed on conventional venography. In order to prevent prolonged swelling or pain from the consequences of the backed up blood from the compressed iliac vein, flow needs to be improved out of the leg. Uncomplicated cases may be managed with compression stockings. Severe May–Thurner syndrome may require thrombolysis if there is a recent onset of thrombosis, followed by angioplasty and stenting of the iliac veinMarder VJ, Aird WC, Bennett JS, Schulman S. Hemostasis and Thrombosis: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. 2013 after confirming the diagnosis with a venogram or an intravascular ultrasound. A stent may be used to support the area from further compression following angioplasty. As the name implies, there classically is not a thrombotic component in these cases, but thrombosis may occur at any time. If the patient has extensive thrombosis, it may be appropriate to consider pharmacologic and/or mechanical (also known as pharmacomechanical) thrombectomy. This is currently being studied to determine whether this will decrease the incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome. Epidemiology May–Thurner syndrome (MTS) is thought to represent between two and five percent of lower-extremity venous disorders. May–Thurner syndrome is often unrecognized; however, current estimates are that this condition is three times more common in women than in men. The classic syndrome typically presents in the second to fourth decades of life. In the 21st century in a broader disease profile, the syndrome acts as a permissive lesion and becomes symptomatic when something else happens such as, following trauma, a change in functional status such as swelling following orthopaedic joint replacement.

London and Chichester: Phillimore, 1981, pp.4-6 The present Georgian Killerton House was built by Sir Thomas Acland, 7th baronet in 1778. The chapel was built in 1738 to the designs of Charles Robert Cockerell. The garden was created in the 1770s by John Veitch, one of the leading landscape designers of the time. It features rhododendrons, magnolias, herbaceous borders and rare trees, as well as an ice house and early 19th-century summer house. The surrounding parkland and woods offer a number of circular walks. Plans attributed to William Sawrey Gilpin (1762-1843) for a new drive from Killerton to Columbjohn (1820) were not implemented; a short play about of the meeting between Veitch and Gilpin was commissioned by The National Trust in the gardens of Killerton in mid 2016.http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/events/83e8693f-e34a-4161-a7a3-52aad5b8f9b6/pages/details Killerton was given to the National Trust by British politician Sir Richard Dyke Acland, 15th Baronet, and in September 2015 The National Trust commissioned a short drama to be staged on the site entitled The Gift, written by Eileen Dillon, telling the story of Sir Richard's decision to hand over his estate. The Lost House In 2016 an archeological dig discovered what is believed to be a footprint of an intended replacement home to the current Killerton. Reports believe that this is what has been known in history as the lost house of Devon, of 240 years, designed by architect James Wyatt. It is a shortish walk from the current site, but still within the grounds, and its existence was obscured by a copse that looks to have been deliberately planted to hide it. Killerton have placed woodwork in all four corners of what they believe would have been the corners of the intended property above the footprints found. They have also placed a door and frame on what they believe would have been the entrance to the intended billiard room. Killerton’s information boards on the site state that there is an intention for further archeological digs in the future.

It was first formed in 1754 with the start of hostilities with France. 1755 In 1755 Col. Joseph Blanchard was given command, and the regiment sent a company under Robert Rogers to build Fort Wentworth on the upper reaches of the Connecticut River before joining Sir William Johnson's army at Fort Edward in New York. During the Battle of Lake George, Col. Blanchard was in command at Fort Edward. When he heard the battle commence and saw the smoke of burning ox-carts he sent a company under Nathaniel Folsom to reinforce Sir William Johnson's army away. Capt. Folsom's company was able to capture the French baggage train and the French commanding officer Jean Erdman, Baron Dieskau, as the French and Indian forces tried to disengage from Sir William Johnson's main force. After the battle a second battalion was raised under the command of Col. Peter Gilman and sent to reinforce the army at Lake George. Both battalions left Fort Edward in December to return home to New Hampshire except for Robert Rogers' ranger company that stayed behind as part of the winter garrison. 1756 In the spring of 1756 two more battalions were raised, with Col. Nathaniel Meserve in command. The 1st battalion was sent to Nova Scotia and the 2nd to the newly built Fort William Henry. 1757 For the 1757 campaign two more battalions were raised. The 1st would again go to Halifax and the 2nd battalion under the command of Lt. Col John Goffe to Fort William Henery. Of the 200 men from the New Hampshire Provincial Regiment at Fort William Henry 80 were killed in the siege and massacre that followed. With the 1st battalion in Nova Scotia and the 2nd battalion regrouping at Fort Edward a new 3rd battalion of infantry with two attached companies of Dragoons was quickly raised under the command of Maj. Thomas Tash and sent to Fort at Number 4 to protect the western frontier of the state. 1758 For the 1758 campaign again two battalions were raised. The 1st under Col. John Hart would join General Jeffrey Amherst in the capture of Fortress Louisbourg and the 2nd under Lt Col. Goffe was sent to join Gen. James Abercrombie in the defeat at the Battle of Carillon. The regiment and the attached rangers stayed on the flanks during the main assault and covered the retreat of the British Army preventing a complete disaster. 1759 & 1760 In 1759 the 1st Battalion went with Gen. James Wolfe to Quebec City and the Battle of the Plains of Abraham serving in a support role followed by the Battle of Sainte-Foy and the subsequent siege of Quebec. Meanwhile, the 2nd battalion was with Gen. Amherst at the capture of Fort Ticonderoga and Fort St. Frédéric, driving the French from the Lake Champlain valley. In 1760, with the continuation of the 1759 Lake Champlain campaign, Col. Goffe commanded the New Hampshire troops who built the Crown Point Military Road from the Fort at Number 4 to the new English fort at Crown Point in forty days during the spring and at the Siege of Montreal and the fall of New France later that year. In 1759 one-third of all able-bodied males of military age in New Hampshire were serving in the British military. 1762 Volunteers from the regiment were with the British Army that captured Havana, Cuba, from the Spanish on August 10, 1762. Other notable members of the regiment were John Stark, William Stark, James Reed, Timothy Bedel, Isaac Wyman, Enoch Hale, Hercules Mooney and Abraham Drake. All of these men would go on to serve as officers during the American Revolutionary War.

Until 1929 it was called the Maryborough Gaol. It should not be confused with the Midlands Prison, which is a newer, medium security prison directly beside it. The prison was built in the 1830s, making it one of the oldest still operating today in the Irish prison system. It is the prison in which people convicted of membership of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and other illegal paramilitary and designated terrorist organisations are usually detained. A number of IRA and dissident republican prisoners are housed in \\"E Block\\". Anyone charged under Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act must be sent to the prison because of its unique security measures.€240,700 to keep a prisoner in Portlaoise Soldiers from the Irish Army patrol Portlaoise Prison on a permanent basis.  Security  Soldiers guard the prison 24 hours a day. The security features include a detachment consisting of approximately platoon strength, armed with rifles and anti- aircraft machine guns, who patrol the prison complex. An air exclusion zone operates over the entire complex. The perimeter consists of high walls, cameras and sensors. The prison has a capacity for 399 prisoners, but because of the security sensitive nature of its inmates, it operates below this capacity and its daily average number of resident inmates was only 119 in 2009. There have been various high-profile attempts to spring prisoners from inside the walls. In 1902, the infamous criminal James Lynchehaun, who was in prison for the attempted murder of Agnes McDonnell, escaped unaided over the walls and made his way to America. The method of escape is well documented in the book, The Playboy and the Yellow Lady and made headlines worldwide.https://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/hero-or-villain-the-gruesome- tale-of-the-real-playboy-of-the-western-world-26850686.html In 1974, nineteen Republican prisoners escaped in one daylight escape.http://www.rte.ie/archives/2014/0818/637799-ira-prisoners-escape-from- portlaoise-prison/ On Friday 29 December 1974 Provisional IRA prisoners held several prison officers hostage and caused considerable destruction to their wing in a protest for better living conditions inside the jail. Irish Army soldiers were used to regain control and the hostages were freed, all of them unharmed.http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch74.htm#291274 In 1975, during an attempted escape, Tom Smith of the IRA's Dublin Brigade was shot dead by the Irish Defence Forces. The prisoners had blasted their way through a door in the recreation area into the prison yard. As the prisoners entered the yard, Irish soldiers opened fire on the inmates, shooting Smith in the head.http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi- bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&day;=17&month;=03&year;=1975 In November 1985, an IRA mass breakout failed when a bomb, which had been assembled within the prison itself, failed to detonate at the prison gates.The Times, 25 November 1985; pg 2 col A  Controversy  During the 1970s and 1980s the prison was noted for its harsh treatment meted out towards prisoners. In 1977 a number of prisoners went on hunger strike demanding a public enquiry into conditions in the prison. In 1946 Sean McCaughey refused to wear prison clothes and spent nearly five years naked except for a blanket in protest against harsh conditions. He commenced a hunger strike on 19 April 1946. After 10 days, he stopped taking water and died on 11 May, the twenty-third day of his protest. In 1984 the Assistant General Secretary of the Prison Officers Association, Tom Hoare strongly criticised conditions within the prison stating that staff were forced by senior management in the prison to use excessive force against prisoners. He also criticised the then Governor of Portlaoise Prison, William Reilly, and the Minister of Justice Michael Noonan stating \\"I accuse the minister of negligence in this area. I accuse the management of Portlaoise Prison of being indifferent to complaints. I would hate to be a prisoner making a complaint\\". At the Prison Officers Association 1984 conference a delegate from Portlaoise Prison, Larry O'Neill, told the conference: \\"If Hitler wanted generals today he would find plenty of them in Portlaoise. After the war the Nazis said many of them were doing their duty and that is what the management in Portlaoise are saying today\\".Evening Press 24 May 1984 Conditions within the prison improved after the death of Governor Reilly and the appointment of John Lonergan as Governor of the prison. In May 2007, an inmate named John Daly, who was serving 9 years for armed robbery, called the RTÉ radio show Liveline from inside the prison.Irish Examiner - Criminal calls RTÉ’s Liveline from prison cell - 2 May 2007 He called in to defend himself against Sunday World crime journalist Paul Williams who was speaking on the radio show at the time. Daly was on air for a few minutes before prison guards took the phone from him and ended the conversation. This phone call resulted in a major clampdown in all Irish prisons and over 1,300 pieces of contraband being confiscated.

Background The song \\"Living Next Door to Alice\\" was listened to on a regular basis in café Gompie in Nijmegen. When the name \\"Alice\\" had passed, it was common for disk jockey Onno Pelser to turn the volume down, and the entire café would scream \\"Alice, who the fuck is Alice?\\". Rob Peters, director of a record company, happened to visit café Gompie one evening and witnessed this show. He approached his friend, singer Peter Koelewijn, and one day later the song was recorded. \\"Gompie\\" was chosen as the artist name. The single became a hit in the Benelux and 80 other countries. In the United Kingdom and the United States, a censored version was released with the name \\"Alice, who the bleep is Alice?\\".

Station layout Like Spring Hill station, Greensboro was built in the median of SR 7 with a single island platform serving two tracks. However, unique among all Silver Line stations in Tysons, it was built partially at ground level and sub-surface. The construction and overall design of the station have been likened to that of Southern Avenue on the Green Line because of its depressed but open-air layout. This is the result of the south end of the station acting as the western portal for the connecting tunnel leading to SR 123 while SR 7 slopes upwards towards the east. A mezzanine covering the central half of the platform contains ticket machines and faregates; two aerial walkway exits cross either side of Route 7 and meet at the mezzanine. The main platform has a height of at its east end and at its west end. History Greensboro station opened as part of the first phase of the Silver Line to Wiehle – Reston East in 2014.

According to the Commission's outline, the area bounded by Route 123, Gosnell Drive, Westpark Drive, and International Drive will be designated as the Tysons Central 7 District and contain high-density residential and commercial mixed-use development. Exterior of the station during construction in 2013 The Tysons Central 7 District is divided into two sub-districts, North and South, separated by Route 7. The south sub-district is approximately large and will contain mixed- use development, with offices predominating near the station and residential buildings in the outer transition zone. The plan calls for a \\"civic commons\\" to be the central open space in the sub-district with government and civi- related buildings surrounding it. The north sub-district is similar in nature, but is in area. In contrast, the north sub-district is planned to be more vibrant and 24-hour than the south, with a minimum building height of , although both sectors have a maximum allowance of . To connect these districts, it is envisioned that Leesburg Pike will be reconfigured, along with Chain Bridge Road, to a \\"boulevard\\" design, with a median separating four lanes of traffic each way, as well as landscaping the sidewalks to improve walkability. Radiating out from Route 7 will be a series of avenues and collector streets, each with different regulations to create a hierarchical street grid.

Synopsis In the game, players take the role of Amagon, a Marine who is trapped on an island after his plane crashed. Inconveniently, his rescue ship is on the other side of the island, which Amagon must now cross on foot. The storyline used for the original Japanese release was somewhat different. The main character is a scientist named \\"Jackson\\" who transforms into his \\"Macho Man\\" form by using the special drug \\"Macho Max\\" that has been taken from his plane by the creatures of \\"Monster Island\\".Totsuzen! Machoman Gameplay Amagon confronting the final boss at the end of the game Amagon encounters a variety of enemies which he can dispose of with his rifle. He also has the ability (upon collecting and then activating the Mega-Key) to transform into a larger, stronger version of himself called \\"Megagon\\". Upon transformation, Megagon is given 1 hit point for every 5,000 points he scored as Amagon (whereas a single hit from any enemy or hazard will kill Amagon). Megagon cannot use the machine gun, but instead has a punch which does eight times the damage and never runs out of ammo. At the cost of one hit point each, he can also fire waves of energy from his chest; these are much broader than machine gun shots, do 16 times the damage, and can hit multiple enemies in a single blast.

At the time, the Hotel Roosevelt was one of two luxury hotels in the city's downtown, with many restaurants and businesses on its ground floor, including a ballroom and a barber shop. At the end of each year, the Hotel Roosevelt hosted hundreds of travelers who came to attend the Gator Bowl. Fire and evacuation The fire started in the ballroom's ceiling. The old ceiling, which was deemed a fire hazard, was not removed when the new ceiling was installed, providing kindling for the fire, which started from faulty wires. The first call to the Jacksonville Fire Department was made at 7:45 a.m., by hotel doorman Alton Joseph Crowden. Smoke was traveling throughout the 13-story building, and hotel visitors climbed out of the smoky building with the help of other patrons and bedsheets tied together. For some that saw that fire department ladders would not reach them, guests threw mattresses to the ground in an attempt to soften the landing. Guests were warned not to jump by a county patrol officer, who drove on the sidewalk and used his microphone to broadcast; \\"Don't jump. The firemen, are coming to get you.\\" Mayor W. Haydon Burns immediately called for assistance from the U.S. Navy, and eight helicopters were flown to downtown from Cecil Field and NAS Jacksonville. The airmen helped the patrons out of the building, and transported them to a nearby parking lot, where ambulances were already waiting. The fire was extinguished by 9:30 a.m., and it was estimated that nearly 475 people were saved from the burning building. After a day of recovering the dead, firefighters found 20 residents dead in their beds from smoke inhalation. A woman died after attempting to climb to safety from her 11th floor room, but slipped while on the makeshift bedsheets rope she had made. In addition, assistant chief J.R. Romedy collapsed of a heart attack during the initial rescue efforts, and died at the scene. = Notable survivors = Survivors of the fire included 1964 Miss America Donna Axum, Manhattan Jaspers basketball coach Ken Norton, and Florida Gators basketball coach Norm Sloan. Aftermath and remembrance Immediately after the fire many local Jacksonville residents, churches and businesses took in displaced hotel guests, and provided food and clothes to those displaced. Property damage to the Hotel Roosevelt was immense, and the hotel was closed in 1964, with most of the hotel's businesses and staff relocating to the equally upscale Hotel George Washington. After much renovation, the building was re- opened as a retirement home and the Jacksonville Regency House, which closed in 1989. The former Hotel Roosevelt, located on Adams Street in downtown, is still standing. The building was placed in the National Register of Historic Places in February 1991. Memorials are still held to remember those who died in the fire; the most recent gathering occurred in December 2003, for the 40th anniversary of the blaze. The building was renovated in recent years and is now known as The Carling, an upscale apartment residence. = Legal = The city and fire department were cleared of liability in nearly 40 lawsuits, which were seeking $10 million in damages related to the fire. The ruling by Circuit Judge Marion Gooding, left Hotel Roosevelt Inc and the fire insurer U.S. Fidelity and Guarantee Co. as the targets for damage claims in the fire, and not the city and the insurance company.

Resolutio omnium Euclidis problematum, 1553 Science of motion In his works Resolutio omnium Euclidis problematum (1553) and Demonstratio proportionum motuum localium (1554), Benedetti proposed a new doctrine of the speed of bodies in free fall. The accepted Aristotelian doctrine at that time was that the speed of a freely falling body is directly proportional to the total weight of the body and inversely proportional to the density of the medium. Benedetti's view was that the speed depends on just the difference between the specific gravity of the body and that of the medium. As opposed to the Aristotelian theory, his theory predicts that two objects of the same material but of different weights would fall at the same speed, and also that objects of different materials in a vacuum would fall at different though finite speeds. In a second edition of the Demonstratio (also 1554), he extended this theory to include the effect of the resistance of the medium, which he said was proportional to the cross section or the surface area of the body. Thus two objects of the same material but of different surface areas would only fall at equal speeds in a vacuum. He repeated this version of his theory in his later Diversarum speculationum mathematicarum et physicarum liber (1585). In this work he explains his theory in terms of the then current theory of impetus. It is thought that Galileo derived his initial theory of the speed of a freely falling body from his reading of Benedetti's works. Thus the account found in Galileo's De motu, his early work on the science of motion, follows Benedetti's initial theory as described above. It omits the later development which included the resistance of the medium and not just its density. In this early work, Galileo also subscribes to the theory of impetus. In 1572, the Jesuit Jean Taisner published from the press of Johann Birkmann of Cologne a work entitled Opusculum perpetua memoria dignissimum, de natura magnetis et ejus effectibus, Item de motu continuo. This is considered a piece of plagiarism, as Taisnier presents, as though his own, the Epistola de magnete of Peter of Maricourt and the second edition of Benedetti's Demonstratio. Music In a letter to Cipriano de Rore dated from around 1563, Benedetti proposed a new theory of the cause of consonance, arguing that since sound consists of air waves or vibrations, in the more consonant intervals the shorter, more frequent waves concurred with the longer, less frequent waves at regular intervals. Isaac Beeckman and Marin Mersenne both adopted this theory in the next century. In the same letter, he proposed a measure of consonance by taking the product of the numerator and the denominator of a rational interval in lowest terms. James Tenney also used this method to develop his measure of \\"harmonic distance\\" (log2(ab) is the harmonic distance for the ratio b/a measured from an arbitrary tonal center 1/1). When they sought Descartes' opinion on Benedetti's theory, Descartes declined to judge the goodness of consonances by such a rational method. Descartes argued that the ear prefers one or another according to the musical context rather than because of any concordance of vibrations.

Plot A singer, Sugar Kane (Linda Evans), is unwittingly being used for publicity stunts for her latest album by her agent (Paul Lynde), for example, faking a skydiving stunt, actually performed by Bonnie (Deborah Walley). Meanwhile, Frankie (Frankie Avalon), duped into thinking he rescued Sugar Kane, takes up skydiving at Bonnie's prompting; she secretly wants to make her boyfriend Steve (John Ashley) jealous. This prompts Dee Dee (Annette Funicello) to also try free-falling. Eric Von Zipper (Harvey Lembeck) and his Rat Pack bikers also show up, with Von Zipper falling madly in love with Sugar Kane. Meanwhile, Bonehead (Jody McCrea) falls in love with a mermaid named Lorelei (Marta Kristen).

He was also the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India from 1962 to 1964. Early life and education D.G. Karve was born in Pune, India in 1898. His father died when he was one year old placing a financial burden on the remaining family. Supported by his mother, he studied at the New English School in Pune and later at Fergusson College. He failed a first-year college examination--an experience that spurred him to bring his academic and life goals into clearer focus. He studied under the distinguished Indian economist Professor V.G. Kale, and in 1921 was awarded the Cobden Club Medal for winning first position in economics on his B.A. examination. Academic achievements In 1923 D.G. Karve joined the Deccan Education Society as a professor of economics. In collaboration with Professor Kale he published a book on Principles of Economics in the Marathi language in 1927, followed by a second volume in 1929. In 1932 he succeeded Professor Kale as Head of the Economics Department at Fergusson College, Pune. In June 1935 the Deccan Education Society appointed him Principal of Willingdon College, Sangli, an institution suffering from low numbers and poor academic standing. By the end of his five- year term the college saw significant improvements in its enrollment, finances and its reputation. He returned to Fergusson College as Head of the History- Economics Department in 1940. He went on to become the first Principal of the newly formed Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce in 1943. Recognition of his contributions to the field of economics led to his election as President of the All-India Economic Conference in 1945 and President of the All-India Agricultural Economic Conference in 1956. He served as Vice Chancellor of the University of Poona from 1959 to 1961. In 1962 Dattatreya Gopal Karve was awarded an Honorary Fellowship at the International Institute of Social Studies (ISS) in The Netherlands. Public administration and the cooperative movement Recognizing that economic policies are unlikely to be successful without effective planning and administration, D.G. Karve worked to educate and promote state planning in India. His contributions to public administration included serving as Chairman of the Bombay Administrative Enquiry Committee, and later as Director of the Indian Institute of Public Administration in 1954. He contributed to India's cooperative movement using his background in agricultural economics to encourage state participation in cooperation. He was chosen to become a Director of the Bombay State Cooperative Bank, Vice-Chairman of the State Bank of India (1960-1962) and Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (1962-1964). During his tenure at the Reserve Bank of India he served as Chairman of the Central Committee of Cooperative Training – a position that helped spread the cooperative model widely within India. He went on to serve as a special consultant to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. He participated in and chaired several commissions of the International Cooperative Alliance, and was Chairman of the 23rd session of the International Cooperative Congress in Vienna in 1966. Legacy In 2005 the Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce (BMCC) established the Principal D.G. Karve Chair in Economics and Commerce. D.G. Karve served as the first Principal of the BMCC in 1943.

Located in Reston, the station is situated alongside Reston Station, a mixed- use urban center. Station layout The station under construction in July 2013 History The \\"Wiehle\\" in the station's name refers to Wiehle Avenue at the eastern end of the station, which itself is named after a small town, Wiehle's Station, built in 1892 that used to be located nearby. The station sits in the median of SR 267, similar to how the Orange Line is located in the median of Interstate 66 from Vienna (the current terminus of the Orange Line). It is about from Spring Hill, the next station to the east. The station has approximately 2,300 parking spaces to the north of the road. The main platform has a height of at its east end and at its west end. In order to foster high density development within walking distance of the station, Fairfax County awarded development rights to an existing park-and-ride lot on the station site. Reston-based Comstock Partners constructed a 2,300 space below-ground parking structure, and is developing of commercial and residential space, which when completed will consist of more than of Class A office space, approximately of restaurants, shops, and service-oriented retailers, a 200-plus room hotel, and approximately 900 luxury residences. The station is the staging point for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority's Silver Line Express Bus, whose 15 minute trips travel between the station and Washington Dulles International Airport every 15 to 20 minutes. The paved Washington & Old Dominion Railroad Trail (W&OD; Trail) crosses Wiehle Avenue northeast of the station.

Life Catoire studied piano in Berlin with Karl Klindworth (a friend of Richard Wagner) from whom he learned to appreciate Wagner. He became one of the few Russian 'Wagnerite' composers, joining the Wagner society in 1879. Catoire graduated from Moscow University in mathematics in 1884 with outstanding honours. Upon graduating, he worked for his father's commercial business, only later becoming a full-time musician. It was at this time that Catoire began taking lessons in piano and basic harmony from Klindworth's student, V. I. Willborg. These lessons resulted in the composition of a piano sonata, some character pieces, and a few transcriptions. The most famous of these transcriptions was the piano transcription of Tchaikovsky's Introduction and Fugue from the First Orchestral Suite (which Jurgenson later published at the recommendation of Tchaikovsky). Not satisfied with his lessons with Willborg, Catoire went to Berlin in late 1885 to continue his lessons with Klindworth. Throughout 1886, he made brief trips to Moscow, and on one of these trips, he became acquainted with Tchaikovsky, who was greatly pleased with Catoire's set of piano variations. Tchaikovsky told the younger composer that, \\"it would be a great sin if he did not devote himself to composition\\". It was during this visit to Moscow that Catoire was introduced to the publisher Jurgenson. Catoire continued to study piano with Klindworth in Berlin throughout 1886, and simultaneously studied composition and theory with Otto Tirsch. Not satisfied with Tirsch's instruction, he began study with Philipp Rüfer. These lessons were also short-lived but resulted in the composition of a string quartet. Catoire returned to Moscow in 1887. He declined to make a debut as a concert pianist, despite Klindworth's recommendation. Catoire met Tchaikovsky again, and he showed him (along with Nikolai Gubert and Sergei Taneyev) the string quartet which he had written in Berlin for Rüfer. They all agreed that the work was musically interesting but lacking in texture. On Tchaikovsky's recommendation, Catoire went to Rimsky-Korsakov in St Petersburg with a request for composition and theory lessons. In a letter to Rimsky-Korsakov, Tchaikovsky later described Catoire as, \\"very talented... but in need of serious schooling.\\" Rimsky-Korsakov gave Catoire one lesson before passing him to Lyadov. This single lesson resulted in three piano pieces which were later published as Catoire's op.2. With Lyadov, Catoire studied counterpoint and wrote several pieces, including the lovely Caprice op.3. Lyadov's lessons concluded Catoire's formal schooling. After returning to Moscow, Catoire became quite close to Anton Arensky. It was during this period that he wrote his second quartet (which he later rewrote as a quintet) and his cantata, \\"Rusalka\\", op.5, for solo voice, women's chorus and orchestra. Catoire's family, friends, and colleagues were not sympathetic to his choice of career in composition, so in 1899, after a series of disappointments, he withdrew to the countryside and nearly gave up composing altogether. After two years of withdrawal from society, and having broken off almost all connections with musical friends, the opus 7 Symphony emerged in the form of a sextet as a result of this seclusion. From 1919 Catoire was professor of composition in the Moscow Conservatory. He wrote several treatises on theory and composition during his tenure. Nikolai Myaskovsky had great regard for Catoire's students. Today Catoire is very little known, although a few recordings exist of his piano works by Marc-André Hamelin, Anna Zassimova and Alexander Goldenweiser, while David Oistrakh and Laurent Breuninger have recorded the complete violin music. His music has a certain semblance to the works of Tchaikovsky, the early works of Scriabin, and the music of Fauré. Catoire's compositions demand not only high virtuosity but also an ear for instrumental colour.

Marinelli was born in Adria, Veneto. A wealthy man, he contributed to Fascist success by financing the March on Rome. Secretary of the National Fascist Party (PNF), he created the Ceka, a secret police established on the model of the Soviet Cheka. The Ceka soon established itself as a terrorist squad, and was behind the assassination of Giacomo Matteotti, a prominent member of the opposition to the Fascist régime. Tried as instigator of the murder in November 1925, Marinelli was defended by Roberto Farinacci himself, and eventually sentenced to a light punishment. His close friendship with Benito Mussolini ensured that he did not serve the full term. He remained out of the spotlight during most of the next two decades of Fascist rule, and appears to have been involved in the crushing of internal opposition to Mussolini (including moves inside the PNF). As a member of the Grand Council of Fascism, on 25 July 1943 he joined the coup d'état carried out by Dino Grandi against Mussolini, as an attempt for Italy to switch sides in World War II (out of the alliance with Nazi Germany and into an agreement with the Allies). When the Nazis helped Mussolini re-establish his rule in Northern Italy, as leader of the Italian Social Republic, Marinelli was convicted of treason during the Verona trial of 1944, and executed by firing squad, along with former foreign minister Galeazzo Ciano, Emilio De Bono, Carlo Pareschi and Luciano Gottardi.

Reston Town Center is approximately to the north of the station. Transit-oriented development As with all stations on the Silver Line within Fairfax County, the Fairfax County Planning Commission aims to transform the surrounding area into a mixed-use, dense, and walkable neighborhood connected to Reston Town Center. The Planning Commission has delineated an area bounded by New Dominion Parkway, Reston Parkway, Sunset Hills Road, Sunrise Valley Drive, and Fairfax County Parkway for transit- oriented development. The vast majority of the precinct is devoted to mixed- use zoning, while some outlying areas are designated for office, industrial, or government use.

Founded in 1833, it is the first Portuguese national museum exhibiting collections of Portuguese art, including a collection by Portuguese sculptor António Soares dos Reis, from which the museum derives its name. History The museum was founded in 1833 as Museum Portuense by King Peter IV. Initially it was housed in the Convent of Santo António (in the centre of Porto), exhibiting religious art confiscated from Portuguese convents, and those works of art expropriated from the absolutist followers of Miguel I (who had struggled against Peter IV a year before). During the 19th century the museum made several acquisitions that were integrated into the main collection. But, it was in 1911 that the museum obtained its collection of work by Soares dos Reis, a celebrated Portuense sculptor, taking on the name of its benefactor. In 1942 the museum was transferred from the centre of the city to the former- residence of the Moraes e Castro family, known commonly as the Carrancas (which means scowlers/frowners, a passing reference to the disapproving nature of its members). The large building provided the spaces and conditions to store and exhibit the collections. Over time, the spaces were expanded and modernised under a project by architect Fernando Távora. Collections The museum has a vast collection mainly focused on Portuguese art of the 19th and 20th centuries, including painting, sculpture, furniture, metalwork and ceramics. Artists represented include painters Domingos Sequeira, Vieira Portuense, Augusto Roquemont, Miguel Ângelo Lupi, António Carvalho de Silva Porto, Marques de Oliveira, Henrique Pousão, Aurélia de Souza, Dórdio Gomes, Júlio Resende and sculptors Soares do Reis, Augusto Santo, António Teixeira Lopes, Rodolfo Pinto do Couto and many others.

She was born to a couple of Cuban actors and she was part of an extended family of artists, being the sister of Venezuelan actor Leon Bravo, one of the pioneers of theater, radio and TV in Venezuela. She published her first book at the age of 16, titled Pétalos sueltos. She then moved back to Cuba with her parents, and later returned to Mexico, where she kept writing and obtained a role in her only film, Corazón bandolero (1934). She became a chair member of the Ateneo Mexicano de Mujeres and later moved back to Cuba, where she wrote the radionovela Yo no creo en los hombres, which was adapted in Mexico for telenovelas in 1969 and 1988. Upon the rise of Fidel Castro, she returned to Mexico, where she would remain the rest of her life. Back in Mexico, she wrote Corazón salvaje, a novel that has been adapted to the screen twice and as a telenovela four times (including once as Juan del Diablo in Puerto Rico). She then wrote La intrusa, Bodas de odio and other novels that earned her important awards.  The nature of her work  Caridad Bravo Adams can easily be identified as the Margaret Mitchell of telenovelas. Though she has her own style of writing Caridad's most successful stories are the ones in which she deals with the Margaret Mitchell- like topic of loveless marriage and the process of conquering one's wife. In Corazón salvaje, La mentira, Bodas de odio (and later Amor real), El otro (and later Por tu amor) she deals with the subject of a seemingly loveless marriage that turns out not to be so. Just like Mitchell, Caridad explores the human psychology from the perspective of a protagonist who ignores her true emotions and goes through a process of realizing the feelings that were there all along. Hence a love and hate relationship begins until finally the emotional worlds of the couple come to light.

Originally planned to be operational by 2018, the station is now expected to open in July 2021. The station was originally planned to be underground, but was built as an above-ground station next to daily parking garage one.  History  The Dulles Metro Station under construction in November 2015. A Washington Metro station had been considered for Dulles since at least 1969, but formal plans were not made until 2002, with the first phase of the project commencing in 2004. According to a 1969–1970 engineering study, a full-scale Metro station was planned (but never built) 28 feet (8.6 m) below a parking lot. The originally planned single-side platform station would not meet current Metro specifications for a center platform, which is necessary since current plans would extend service beyond the airport to western suburbs. Plans for an above-ground facility drew concerns from the Virginia Historic Preservation Office regarding the visual impact on the Eero Saarinen-designed terminal. Consultants estimated that an above-ground station would save $640 million in construction costs. On April 6, 2011, the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) board voted 9–4 to build an underground station away from the terminal, rather than an above-ground station away from the terminal, at an additional cost of $330 million. Construction of the underground station would have extended its expected opening to mid-2017. However, on July 20, 2011, the MWAA board reversed its previous vote and approved an above-ground station due to pressure from state and local officials to reduce overall project costs. Station layout The station will be connected to the terminal building using the existing pedestrian tunnel which connects the hourly and daily parking lots and parking garage 1 to the baggage claim level of the airport terminal; it is equipped with moving sidewalks. The section of the tunnel connecting the terminal and daily and hourly lots to parking garage 1 was closed in January 2016 in order to reconfigure that tunnel section to accommodate the future Metro station entrance.

CFL Vic Washington first starred with the CFL's Ottawa Rough Riders in 1968 and 1969, winners of back-to-back Grey Cup Championships in 1968 & 1969 against the Calgary Stampeders and the Saskatchewan Roughriders, respectively. In the first of the two title matches, Washington received the Most Valuable Player award for his game-winning 80-yard touchdown run from scrimmage, establishing a Grey Cup record that still stands. He played one more season in the CFL with the 1970 B.C.Lions before leaving for the NFL. NFL After signing with the NFL's San Francisco 49ers, he rushed for 811 yards with a 4.2 average, was named to his only Pro Bowl and helped to lead the team to the National Football Conference finals in 1971.

History  The area now known as American River was first visited by Europeans in 1802 when Matthew Flinders landed to survey this part of Kangaroo Island. In 1803, a group of American sealers camped for four months in the area. They arrived on the brig and built their own 35 ton schooner Independence from local timber. The town takes its name from this time. A memorial plaque and accompanying anchor (recovered in 1969) from an early American whaling vessel is dedicated to Union s crew. Frank Potts was the first official settler in 1842, before moving to the mainland and establishing the Bleasdale vineyard and winery at Langhorne Creek. John Buick, a professional boat builder, built the first house in the town in 1844. It was fashioned out of local stone, pug and sput timber and remained standing until 1985. Somewhat erroneously, the waters of Eastern Cove, upon which the township is located, have been referred to as American River, compounding the illusion that the township is connected in any way with a river. A fish canning factory existed for a few years from the late 1890s, remnants of which may still be found on the shore north of the town proper. Gypsum was mined at Flour Cask Bay, later at Pelican Lagoon and trucked to nearby Ballast Head, from 1956 until 1986. Until the 1980s the town was serviced regularly by the ketches Falie, Nelcebee (last service 15 April 1982) and Ulonga, operated by R. Fricker & Co. Consequently, on cessation of this service the wharf area for some time was a redundant commercial facility, resulting in the removal of several buildings and fuel facilities. Recently however, the advent of oyster farming has seen new shedding erected and increased activity, in harmony with recreational boating activities. The population has increased steadily in recent years, while nearby hamlets in the vicinity of Eastern Cove, such as Island Beach and Baudin Beach, South Australia have become more prominent. Electricity supply to American River was only made permanent in 1967. Tourism The town looks out over Pelican Lagoon, which is a popular place for birdwatching, kayaking and boating, though fishing within the lagoon is prohibited. The establishment of guest houses at American River in the early part of the last century were the forerunner of today's tourism industry on Kangaroo Island. Ryberg, Lierich, and Linnett, are names synonymous with the development of tourism at American River. Nils Ryberg, a Swedish born immigrant, settled at American River in 1884, and ten years later built the original \\"Ryberg House\\" on the site of the present Kangaroo Island Lodge, exclusively for tourist accommodation. Ryberg added to the building over several years, before selling to John and Valerie Linnett in 1913. Ryberg House was completely rebuilt in 1928, and remains today. Fishing trips were an integral part of the business, with three boats, Warrigal, Linnette and Linnette 2 comprising the fleet which operated until 1985. The business was operated until John Linnett's death in 1955, after which time his four sons, Keith, Lionel, Leon and Gordon continued under the name of Linnetts Pleasure Resort. Leon Linnett assumed sole proprietorship in 1971, expanding the resort with the erection of several new wings and refurbishing the reception, administration and restaurant areas in 1980, when the resort became known as Linnetts Island Club. Leon Linnett sold the property in the late 1990s to an Adelaide-based consortium that trades under the name Kangaroo Island Lodge.Cordes, Neville, Linnetts - A Kangaroo Island Dynasty 2005, Statewide and Global Group,  Facilities  The town supports a Country Fire Service brigade and South Australian Ambulance Service depot. An active sports and community association maintains a focal point for weekly meals and community awareness, whilst an annual fishing competition, normally held at Easter, is popular. There is a small store and post office, providing most postal services (limited banking) on Buick Drive. There is also a small cafe and gift shop located at the wharf which is open from 10.00am to 3.00pm daily. An extensive wharf with mooring facilities for large commercial fishing boats was completed in 1964. A new, triple berth boat ramp with floating pontoons was completed in July 2008. In recent years several new land subdivisions have seen increased development within the township, highlighting the need for improved effluent disposal and water supply. A Community Wastewater Management Scheme was implemented in 2009.  Transport  Since the withdrawal of services by ketches to American River, there has been no direct freight service. During the 1980s, there was a passenger ferry service operated by John and Ann Hamlyn between Cape Jervis and American River, using the mono hulled Valerie Jane. Air services were operated for a number of years by Emu Airways, utilising a privately owned airstrip located to the north of the township. Air Transport regulations subsequently rendered the airstrip unsuitable for commercial flights. An accommodation venue at nearby Muston publicises access via an alternative, private air strip.

Biography Hiorthøy was born and raised in Trondheim, Norway, and studied at the Trondheim Academy of Fine Art (1991–96) as well as the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen (1999–2000). During his tenure at the Trondheim Academy of Fine Art, Hiorthøy spent a year abroad in 1994 to attend the School of Visual Arts in New York. There he worked extensively with Cinematographer Mott Hupfel. Currently, he lives and works in Berlin, Germany. A fictionalized version of Hiorthøy is a character in Erlend Loe's novel L. Career =Music= Hiorthøy began making music while attending the Trondheim Academy of Fine Art; he worked in the academy's sound studio until he left school and purchased his own equipment. After various \\"collaborations and accidents\\", his music was eventually introduced to Joakim Haugland of the Smalltown Supersound record label. Haugland asked Hiorthøy to work with the label, and in 2001 Hiorthøy released his debut album, \\"Hei\\". He has subsequently released several albums, EPs, and 7-inch records with Smalltown Supersound. Hiorthøy's musical style is difficult to classify; the Smalltown Supersound website offers the following description: \\"On his records Kim Hiorthøy combines weird beats, lo- fi/leftfield electronics, field recordings, electro-acoustic sounds and samples, resulting in a sound all his own.\\" His live sets, however, differ from his recordings, with louder, faster beats and a techno undertone. =Graphic design and film= While exploring music at the Trondheim Academy of Fine Art, Hiorthøy simultaneously began his work in graphic design. He started to publish fanzines and design record sleeves for local bands, and as time passed he began to work more seriously in a variety of creative mediums. To date, Hiorthøy has released several collections of photography, drawing and design, and has provided cover artworks for such record labels as Rune Grammofon, Smalltown Supersound, Smalltown Superjazzz and the rock group Motorpsycho. He is currently represented by STANDARD, an Oslo-based gallery aimed at promoting contemporary Norwegian artists. Some of his other creative achievements include film directing, film photography, and illustration for children's books. In a 2004 interview with KultureFlash.com, Hiorthøy described the relationship between graphic design and music: \\"I regard them as very different things, even though the place in my head that decides if something works or not is the same for both\\".

History former logo =Early Years= On September 6, 1922, the station signed on with the sequentially issued call letters KFCB.FCC History Cards (FCC.gov)\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, October 2, 1922, page 3. It was the second radio station in Arizona, after KTAR went on the air three months earlier. KFCB was owned by the Nielson Radio Supply Company of Phoenix. After using several frequencies in its early years, it settled on 1390 kilocycles, with a power of 1,000 watts by day, 500 watts at night. On February 8, 1929 the call letters were changed to KOY, which it would keep for 70 years. The station became a CBS Radio Network affiliate, running its dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the \\"Golden Age of Radio.\\" =Top 40= In the 1960s and 70s, KOY played Top 40 hits. It was acquired by The Southern Company in 1967. Southern also acquired an FM station in 1971, 95.5 KRFM, which played beautiful music. It later became KQYT, standing for \\"Quiet.\\" In the 1980s, as hit music shifted from AM to FM, KQYT became Top 40 Y-95, taking the KOY call letters and format from 550 AM. That led KOY to switch to a middle of the road format of popular adult music, news and talk. By the 1990s, it had moved all the way to adult standards. =Sports and Talk= In 1997, San Antonio-based Clear Channel Communications acquired Chancellor Media, which owned KOY and its FM sister station, which had changed its call letters to KYOT.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2001 page D-23 Clear Channel also acquired AMFM, Inc. That came with AM 910 KGME and FM 102.5 KZON. On May 7, 1999, KOY's call letters were changed to KGME, with 550 taking on a sports radio format. The call letters represented the word \\"Game.\\" The KOY call sign was transferred to the former KISO, operating on 1230 kHz. A year later, on September 26, 2000, there was a further call letter swap. The talk radio format on AM 910, along with its KFYI call sign, were moved to AM 550. And the sports format and KGME call letters were moved to AM 910. The call sign KFYI had been previously used by a station in Oakland, California, now KMKY.History of the call signs of KMKY KFYI signed on at 5:30am on July 10, 1985 with Morning Host Charlie Van Dyke, newsman Brad Messer and sports anchor Jim Jeffrey. KFYI host Barry Young served as the station's program director from 1988 until 1998, retiring from the station on November 7, 2014. Former Congressman J. D. Hayworth hosted a weekday show in the late 2000s on KFYI. He resigned from KFYI in 2010 to pursue an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate against Senator John McCain. =Controversy= On March 8, 2006, KFYI made news when fill-in host Brian James suggested that the United States National Guard and Border Patrol should shoot to kill people illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexican border. He also said on the air that he would be \\"happy to sit there with my high-powered rifle and my night scope\\" and kill people as they cross the border.

He has been nominated twice for the National Book Critics Circle Award. Biography George attended St. John's University. He was an intern at the New York Amsterdam News before being hired as black music editor for Record World. He later served as a music editor for Billboard magazine from 1982 to 1989. While there, George published two books: Where Did Our Love Go: The Rise and Fall of the Motown Sound in 1986, and The Death of Rhythm & Blues in 1988. He also wrote a column, entitled \\"Native Son\\", for the Village Voice from 1988 to 1992. He first got involved in film when, in 1986, he helped to finance director Spike Lee's debut feature She's Gotta Have It. A lifelong resident of Brooklyn, New York, George currently lives in Fort Greene. Literary work George has authored 15 non-fiction books, including the bestseller The Michael Jackson Story in 1984, Blackface: Reflections on African-Americans and the Movies in 1994, Elevating the Game: Black Men and basketball in 1992, and Hip Hop America in 1998. In 2005, he published Post-Soul Nation, which further developed his concept of \\"post-soul\\" black culture. With Alan Leeds, he co-authored The James Brown Reader, a collection of articles about the \\"Godfather of Soul,\\" in 2008. George's The Death of Rhythm and Blues chronicles and critiques the path that R&B; has taken. He takes a close look at the genre's fall to the hands of the mainstream and even suggests that some popular artists \\"sold out\\". George has written three detective novels featuring bodyguard-turned-private investigator D Hunter. All three novels—The Accidental Hunter, The Plot Against Hip-Hop: A Novel, and The Lost Treasures of R&B;—have been optioned by rapper/actor Common. Film and television work In 1991, George co-wrote the Halle Berry vehicle Strictly Business and in 1993 he was co-creator of the movie CB4 starring comedian Chris Rock. In 2004, George made a short film called To Be a Black Man, starring Samuel L. Jackson, and a documentary called A Great Day in Hip-Hop. Both titles appeared in festivals in New York, London, and Amsterdam. He executive-produced the HBO film Everyday People which also debuted in 2004 at the Sundance Film Festival. Currently he is serving as co- executive producer of VH1's Hip Hop Honors television show and executive producer of Black Entertainment Television's American Gangster series, which was the highest rated series in the history of BET in 2006.

Unlike the legendary Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s, which was largely a literary scene, the artists collected in these neighborhoods were as involved with newer means of expression (film, rock music, hip hop, avant garde theater, stand-up comedy, photography) as with traditional African-American artistic pursuits (poetry, jazz). The film premiered on Showtime Networks in February 2012 for Black History Month. Finding The Funk was released in March 2013, it traced the history of funk music from the 1960s to the present day.

The Beautiful Poster Lady: A Life of Ethel Reed. New Castle, DE: Oak Knoll Press, 2013. In the 1890s, her works received critical acclaim in America and Europe. In 2016 they were on exhibit in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Museum of Modern Art in New York, the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, and the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City. Early life and career Ethel Reed was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, on March 13, 1874, she was the daughter of a local photographer and an Irish American mother and the daughter of Edgar Eugene Reed. Her father died when she was an adolescent, and Ethel and her mother consequently suffered hardship. After they moved to Boston in 1890, she studied briefly at the Cowles Art School in 1893, and after 1894 began to receive public notice for her illustrations. Reed's youthful beauty and cleverness caught the attention of a Newburyport artist Laura Hills, who became a mentor.A Chat with Ethel Reed. The Bookman: A Literary Journal, Volume II, Number 4 (December, 1895), pp. 287–291. During her time in Boston, she achieved national fame as a poster artist while still in her early twenties. She did many series of posters and book illustrations during a span of less than two years. In the mid-1890s she was engaged to fellow artist Philip Leslie Hale, whose father Edward Everett Hale was a prominent Bostonian. However, the engagement was broken off. In 1896, she traveled Europe with her mother. In 1897 they settled in London where Reed worked as an illustrator, in particular for the Yellow Book, a quarterly literary periodical, which was co-founded by Aubrey Beardsley. She had two children with different lovers. She was acquainted with important literary and artistic figures of her day: the writer Richard le Gallienne, the architects Bertram Goodhue and Ralph Adams Cram, the photographer Fred Holland Day. Ethel Reed was the model for Day's photographs Chloe and The Gainsborough Hat. She also modeled at least three times for portraits by Frances Benjamin Johnston.Hirshler, Erica E., Janet L. Comey, and Ellen E. Roberts. A Studio of Her Own: Women Artists in Boston, 1870–1940. Boston: MFA Publications, 2001.

The process was invented in 1874 by Emil Wohlwill. This electrochemical process involves using a cast gold ingot, often called a Doré bar, of 95%+ gold to serve as an anode. Lower percentages of gold in the anode will interfere with the reaction, especially when the contaminating metal is silver or one of the platinum group elements. The cathode(s) for this reaction are small sheets of pure (24k) gold sheeting or stainless steel. Current is applied to the system, and electricity travels through the electrolyte of chloroauric acid. Gold and other metals are dissolved at the anode, and pure gold (coming through the chloroauric acid by ion transfer) is plated onto the gold cathode. When the anode is dissolved, the cathode is removed and melted or otherwise processed in the manner required for sale or use. The resulting gold is 99.999% pure, and of higher purity than gold produced by the other common refining method, the Miller process, which produces gold of 99.95% purity. For industrial gold production the Wohlwill process is necessary for highest purity gold applications. When lower purity gold is required refiners often utilize the Miller process due to its relative ease, quicker turnaround times, and because it does not require a large inventory of gold, in the form of chloroauric acid, on site at all times.

History Temple Beth Israel, now the Heinen Theater, was a part of Third Ward Soon after the 1836 establishment of Houston, the City Council established four wards as political subdivisions of the city. The original Third Ward district extended south of Congress Street and east of Main Street and ended at the north shore of the Brays Bayou; what was then the district includes what is today portions of Downtown Houston and Midtown Houston in addition to residential African American area currently identified as Third Ward, which is located southeast of Downtown Houston. As of 2003 the usage of the land within the boundaries of the historic Third Ward is more diverse than the land usage in the current Third Ward.Wood, Roger.

Afterwards, according to Bivins, the area \\"began a long downward slide toward the skid row of the 1990s\\" and the hotels were changed into flophouses.

By the 1930s the White and Black populations of Third Ward were about even. After World War II White residents and the Temple Beth Israel moved from Third Ward to newly developed suburbs on the southwest side, and Third Ward became mostly African American.Wood, Roger.

In the post-World War II period a large number of black migrants, many of them from Louisiana and some from East Texas and other areas in the Deep South, settled in Third Ward. The community became characterized by poverty since many of these migrants were unable to get non- menial jobs. In the era of racial segregation, Almeda Road, a road located in Third Ward area that at that time served as a corridor to Downtown Houston, was a busy commercial corridor.Duggins, Kamilah. \\"Third-Ward Rebound.\\" Houston Press.

The People's Party II, a community activist organization that eventually became the Houston Chapter of the Black Panther Party was originally led by Carl Hampton - a charismatic speaker who organized the PPII at 2800 Dowling Street in the spring of 1970 to address police brutality and corruption towards Black and Brown people in the community. Hampton died after being shot without provocation by police from a top of a church on July 26, 1970.\\"Parting shots Political activists recall the shooting death of a Black Panther leader by Houston police and the turmoil preceding it. \\" Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

Gonzales of the Houston Chronicle stated that there were disputes between southern whites and blacks regarding th nature of Hampton's death. Carl Hampton's contribution to Third Ward Community was the Rainbow Coalition that included The MAYO group - a Mexican community activist group - and The John Brown Revolutionary League, a group of white community activists. These groups worked together to bring about positive changes in their working class communities by supporting each other's \\"survival\\" programs. Programs included free childcare, free food giveaway, free fumigation for poor people, assisting the elderly in the community and free sickle cell anemia testing. Charles Boko Freeman became the PPII/local Black Panther Party Chairman. Party activity continued until membership dropped in late 1974 and early 1975 due to constant police repression. In the 1960s and 1970s many families in Third Ward relocated to racially integrated suburbs; racial integration allowed many Blacks to move to the suburbs, therefore Third Ward lost some of its population with decades of neglect and economic traffic. Despite the relocations the Almeda Road commercial corridor remained busy. Kent Hadnot, the executive director of Third Ward Redevelopment Council, said in a 2000 Houston Press article that blockbusting beginning in the 1970s began to drive homeowners and business owners away from the Third Ward and into suburbs such as Missouri City. The construction of Texas State Highway 288, which offered a quicker alternative into Downtown, caused Almeda Road's commercial properties to decline. In addition 288's construction had divided existing parts of Third Ward. Many children of Third Ward area business owners, educated in universities, had no desire to work in their parents' businesses, reducing the employee base of the Third Ward businesses. The 1980s oil bust hurt the economy of Third Ward and the nearby Almeda Road commercial corridor.

Garnet Coleman—a state representative from the area—expressed his opposition to gentrification and a desire to keep the original residents in the neighborhood. Coleman had some control over the Midtown Tax Increment Financing District, which bought land in Third Ward and enacted deeds restricting what may be done with the land, so that the land could indefinitely be used to house low income residents. In 2009, Coleman said \\"We learned a lot from the debacle in the Fourth Ward. So it would be stupid not to respond to the negative byproducts of rapid development. We want to find people who will make this community better by becoming part of its fabric, not by changing its fabric.\\" In 2010 Norris published an article in the Thurgood Marshall Law Review stating how existing Third Ward residents could continue to keep their properties, including enforcing deed restrictions; because the City of Houston does not have zoning, many Houston neighborhoods use deed restrictions to maintain their existing setups and atmospheres.

Witcher of the Houston Press reported that the Third Ward, as defined by Third Ward Redevelopment Council, \\"may be the most variegated community in Houston.\\" Witcher described the area west of Texas Southern University, \\"the heart of the Third Ward,\\" as having \\"blocks of sturdy, well-tended brick houses,\\" and being the \\"home\\" to the \\"diminished but still-viable base of middle-class and working-class homeowners and renters\\" of the area. The brick houses, south of Truxillo are larger and, in the words of Roger Wood, author of Down in Houston: Bayou City Blues, \\"nicer\\" than the housing stock north of Truxillo. Throughout the history of Third Ward, African Americans gradually occupied the brick houses. As of 2003 the brick houses are in varying conditions; Woods said that some are \\"beautifully renovated,\\" some are \\"respectfully maintained,\\" and some are \\"severely neglected.\\" Witcher described the northern part of Third Ward, which in his view \\"more than any other in Third Ward, call to mind the word 'ghetto,' Houston-style,\\" as having \\"rows of shotgun shacks, worn frame houses and fraying apartments\\" owned by absentee landlords. The section included crime, families affected by welfare dependency, unemployment, and proliferation of recreational drugs. In the summer residents of that area who wanted to cool down from the summer heat sat on porches and visited friends on the streets. The Third Ward area included many churches of varying sizes; some churches still attracted members who lived in Missouri City and other suburbs. The shotgun shacks, located north of Truxillo Street, are smaller and more cheaply built than the houses, and they have been historically occupied by working class African Americans. Some shotgun shacks have been continually occupied, and some shotgun shacks have been abandoned; some of the abandoned shotgun shacks have been boarded up. Emancipation Avenue, renamed as such in 2017 and previously Dowling Street, has served as the main northeast to southeast artery of the Third Ward.

Its representative as of 2008 is Sheila Jackson Lee. Crime Ronald E. McNair South Central Police Station Crime in Third Ward has been on a steady decline since 2006 and as of 2014. According to Houston Police Department's Uniform Crime Summary, there were approximately 1,428 total violent and non-violent crimes in 2006 in the Third Ward area patrolled by police beat 10H50. In 2013, there were approximately 991 violent and non-violent crimes in the area. In other words, there were 437 fewer crimes in 2013 than in 2006. Some of the drops in crime rate may be related to the fact that the City of Houston, the University of Houston, and other private companies are cleaning up the area through construction. A prime example of this is the Campus Vue apartment complex off North MacGregor Way and Calhoun Road. Other companies like Fountain Residential Partners and Asset Campus Housing, who have decided to build off-campus boutique dorms in the area, are receiving tax abatement and government support for building in a high poverty area. “We continually evaluate the types of crime that are affecting our community and adjust our patrol and investigation methods to address those issues,” said Bret Collier, UHPD lieutenant and chief of staff.

In essence, the jobber acts as the \\"middleman\\" between the company that refines the petroleum products and those that use them or market them at retail prices. The jobber often owns the gasoline being sold, and the station it is being sold to, but allows an operator to lease the store. In 2001, 44.3% of all gasoline in the U.S. was sold through jobbers. Approximately the same percentage was sold through integrated oil company-owned and operated stores or franchise arrangements. The percentage of jobbers responsible for fuel sale in the USA in 2004 fell to 37.3%.

At the 2016 census, Langhorne Creek had a population of 427. Wine Industry Langhorne Creek has a wine history dating back to 1850. Traditionally a red wine growing district well known for production of outstanding Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz. These two red wine grape varieties constitute approximately 70% of the total vineyard plantings in the region. Over recent years, considerable experimentation has occurred and a wide range of grape varieties are now grown. The vineyards harvest from early March to late April. The town is on the banks of the Bremer River which flows into Lake Alexandrina. In winter, the river frequently floods across the vineyards, contributing to the terroir of the region. Features The township has numerous places to eat: the Langhorne Creek General Store and The Bridge Hotel can be found on the main street of the town while the Angas Plains Estate, Bremerton and Lake Breeze cellar doors all offer lunch menus that go perfectly with a glass of wine. Additionally, The Winehouse is available to hire for functions and features a full kitchen. Langhorne Creek has seven cellar doors, all open seven days a week: Angas Plains Estate, Bremerton, Bleasdale, Lake Breeze, Rusticana, The Winehouse and Vineyard Road Cellar Door. Frank Potts Reserve (named for the founder of the nearby Bleasdale winery) and Alfred Langhorne Park (for one of the cattle-droving brothers Alfred and Charles) are popular places to picnic and excellent areas to observe native flora and fauna.  Sport  Despite its relatively small population, Langhorne Creek boasts a strong culture of success across a number of sports. Langhorne Creek fields teams in the following sports: Australian rules football, netball, cricket, tennis, lawn bowls and table tennis. The main venue for football, cricket, netball, tennis and lawn bowls is Langhorne Creek Memorial Park which is located at Murray Road, Langhorne Creek.

Early life David Briggs was born in Douglas, Wyoming. Briggs left Wyoming in 1962 to hitchhike his way to Los Angeles and Canada, then finally settled in California, the place he would call home for the rest of his life. In the mid-sixties, Briggs began producing in the music business working on Bill Cosby's label, Tetragrammaton Records.http://djangomusic.com/artist_bio.asp?pid=P+++407102&morebio;=1 One of the first albums he produced was for comedian Murray Roman. According to Briggs, this was the first album ever released with the word \\"fuck\\" on it. Working on Cosby's label led Briggs into doing his own production work with people such as Alice Cooper, Summerhill, Quatrain, Spirit, Nils Lofgren and his band, Grin, and Jerry Lynn Williams. Career In 1968, after picking up a hitchhiking Neil Young, Briggs went on to produce the singer/songwriter's first solo album, entitled Neil Young (1968). This led to a lifelong friendship between the two men, with Briggs co-producing over a dozen of Young's albums including Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere and After the Gold Rush. Young's Sleeps with Angels album (1994) is the last work that Briggs produced before his death in 1995. Other than producing with Young, Briggs worked on albums with many successful artists such as Spirit, Tom Rush, Nils Lofgren, Steve Young, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, and Royal Trux. Personal life David had one son, Lincoln, with artist Shannon Forbes in 1969. In 1988, Briggs married Bettina Linnenberg. Bettina would soon be noted as the production coordinator on many of the projects that Briggs produced in the 1990s. These projects included Nick Cave, 13 Engines, Sidewinder, and Royal Trux. She also helped him on projects that would never be released, including work with John Eddie and Blind Melon. Briggs was a spiritual atheist.Shakey: Neil Young's Biography Death and posthumous projects David Briggs died on November 26, 1995, after a battle with lung cancer. He was 51 years old. Before his death, he was still working with Joel Bernstein on the Neil Young Archives project. This project had been underway for five years before his death and there could be anywhere from three to twenty albums worth of unreleased material. After Briggs' death Neil Young and Crazy Horse went on to record material such as Broken Arrow, released in 1996 and Year of the Horse, released in 1997. They have recorded sporadically in the new millennium, releasing the studio albums Greendale (2003), and Psychedelic Pill (2012). The band The Low & Sweet Orchestra was working with David Briggs at the time of his death. Their album Goodbye To All That was released in 1996, and featured 9 out of 12 tracks produced by Briggs. Critical views Briggs' work was not universally acclaimed. Neal Smith of the Alice Cooper group later said \\"David hated our music and us. I recall the term that he used, referring to our music, was 'psychedelic shit'.\\" I think Easy Action sounded too dry, more like a TV or radio commercial and he did not help with song arrangement or positive input in any way.\\" His sessions with Nick Cave were also acrimonious, which led to Cave remixing the album Henry's Dream.

It was held in Chicago in 1948 and 1949 along the shore of Lake Michigan and is often referred to as \\"the last great railroad fair\\" with 39 railroad companies participating. The board of directors for the show was a veritable \\"Who's Who\\" of railroad company executives.  History of the fair  The origin of the fair traces back to the Chicago and North Western Railway (CNW), which at the time was the successor of the first railroad to operate out of Chicago, the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad. CNW was seeking a way to commemorate 100 years of railroading in Chicago, especially as it was done on the CNW itself. Public Relations Manager F.V. Koval is credited with developing the idea behind the fair. The CNW advertising and public relation staff went to work to promote the show in the early months of 1948, beginning with a series of photographs made by company photographer Don Lidikay of people in 19th century costumes posing with the locomotive Pioneer, which had pulled the first train out of Chicago in 1848. The fair was rapidly planned during the winter and spring of 1948, and originally scheduled to run between July and August of that summer. Erected on of Burnham Park in Chicago between 21st and 31st Streets, the fair opened after only six months of planning. A grand opening for the fair commenced on July 20 with a parade that featured such spectacles as a military marching band and a replica of a troop train, a contingent of cowboys and Native Americans, a replica of the Tom Thumb, the first American locomotive, and the spry, octogenarian widow of Casey Jones, who served as honorary Grand Master of the parade. One dollar was the price of admission, and, except food, all the attractions, displays, exhibits and shows were free. Besides the thirty-nine railroads who participated in the fair, there were more than twenty equipment manufacturers, including General Motors. The Santa Fe also sponsored an Indian Village where Native Americans sold handicrafts, staged dances, and explained the different types of lodging that were on display.Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, \\"Santa Fe Railway Indian Village\\" (ATSF). The explanatory brochure was printed in both 1948 and 1949. A highlight of the fair was the presence of the Freedom Train. The Freedom Train travelled the country from September 17, 1947, through Jan 22, 1949, and was at the Railroad Fair from July 5 – 9. It held many documents and artifacts from the National Archives. Available for public viewing were the original United States Constitution, Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. Security of the documents was the responsibility of the Marine Corps.  Board of directors  The officers and board of directors for the fair were mostly prominent railroad executives. The fair's officers were: * President - Lenox R. Lohr, President Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago * Vice President - R.L. Williams, President Chicago and North Western Railway * Treasurer - Wayne A.

This was a dramatic and musical presentation intended to showcase the development of transportation and the railroads across the country beginning with trails and waterways. The pageant included a recreation of the Golden Spike ceremony at Promontory, Utah, and various historic rolling stock and replicas of equipment in operation.

In 1948 Walt Disney and animator Ward Kimball attended the fair. To their enjoyment they not only got to see all of the equipment, but they were also allowed to operate some of the steam locomotives that were at the Fair. Upon their return to Los Angeles, Disney used the Fair, the House of David Amusement Park, and Greenfield Village, as inspiration for a \\"Mickey Mouse Park\\" that eventually became Disneyland. Walt also went on to build his own backyard railroads, building the Carolwood Pacific Railroad. Kimball already had his own, named Grizzly Flats Railroad.

The current lighthouse stands at the north end of Anastasia Island and was built between 1871 and 1874. The tower is the second lighthouse tower in St. Augustine, the first being lit officially by the American territorial government in May 1824 as Florida's first lighthouse. However, both the Spanish and the British governmentshttp://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/LAMP/Historical_Research/Turner%20El%20Escribano.pdf operated a major aid to navigation here including a series of wooden watch towers and beacons dating from 1565.http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/ourstories/LighthouseStory The current lighthouse tower, original first-order Fresnel Lens and the Light Station grounds are owned by the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum, Inc., a not-for-profit maritime museum.

The non profit mission is to \\"discover, preserve, present and keep alive the stories of the nation's oldest porthttp://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/nha/Significance as symbolized by our working St. Augustine Lighthouse.\\" History The St. Augustine lighthouse in 1824 St. Augustine was the site of the first lighthouse established in Florida by the new, territorial, American Government in 1824. According to some archival records and maps, this \\"official\\" American lighthouse was placed on the site of an earlier watchtower built by the Spanish as early as the late 16th century. A map of St. Augustine made by Baptista Boazio in 1589, depicting Sir Francis Drake's attack on the city, shows an early wooden watch tower near the Spanish structure, which was described as a \\"beacon\\" in Drake's account. By 1737, Spanish authorities built a more permanent tower from coquina taken from a nearby quarry on the island. Archival records are inconclusive as to whether the Spanish used the coquina tower as a lighthouse, but it seems plausible, given the levels of maritime trade by that time. The structure was regularly referred to as a \\"lighthouse\\" in documents—including ship's logs and nautical charts—dating to the British Period beginning in 1763. In 1783, the Spanish once again took control of St. Augustine, and once again the lighthouse was improved. Swiss-Canadian engineer and marine surveyor Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres marks a coquina \\"Light House\\" on Anastasia Island in his 1780 engraving, \\"A Plan of the Harbour of St. Augustin\\". Jacques-Nicolas Bellin, Royal French Hydrographer, refers to the coquina tower as a \\"Batise\\" in Volume I of Petit Atlas Maritime. The accuracy of these scholars is debated still; DesBarres work includes some obvious errors, but Belline is considered highly qualified. His work provides an important reference to St. Augustine's geography and landmarks in 1764. Facing erosion and a changing coastline, the old tower crashed into the sea in 1880, but not before a new lighthouse was lit. Today, the tower ruins are a submerged archaeological site. Early lamps in the first tower burned lard oil. Multiple lamps with silver reflectors were replaced by a fourth order Fresnel lens in 1855, greatly improving the lighthouse's range and eliminating some maintenance issues. At the beginning of the Civil War, future mayor Paul Arnau, a local Menorcan harbor master, along with the lightkeeper, a woman named Maria Mestre de los Dolores Andreu (who, in this role, became the first Hispanic-American woman to serve in the Coast Guard), removed the lens from the old lighthouse and hid it, in order to block Union shipping lanes. The lens and clock works were recovered after Arnau was held captive on a ship off-shore and forced to reveal their location. By 1870, beach erosion was threatening the first lighthouse. Construction on a new light tower began in 1871 during Florida's reconstruction period. In the meantime, a jetty of coquina and brush was built to protect the old tower. A trolley track brought building supplies from the ships at the dock. The new tower was completed in 1874, and put into service with a new first order Fresnel lens. It was lit for the first time in October by keeper William Russell. Russell was the first lighthouse keeper in the new tower, and the only keeper to have worked both towers. For 20 years, the site was manned by head-keeper William A. Harn of Philadelphia. Major Harn was a Union war hero who had commanded his own battery at the Battle of Gettysburg. With his wife, Kate Skillen Harn, of Maine, he had six daughters. The family was known for serving lemonade out on the porches of the keepers' house, which was constructed as a Victorian duplex during Harn's tenure. On August 31, 1886, the Charleston earthquake caused the tower to \\"sway violently\\", according to the keeper's log, but there was no recorded damage. In 1885, after many experiments with different types of oils, the lamp was converted from lard oil to kerosene. During World War II, Coast Guard men and women trained in St. Augustine, and used the lighthouse as a lookout post for enemy ships and submarines which frequented the coastline. In 1907, indoor plumbing reached the light station, followed by electricity in the keeper's quarters in 1925. The light itself was electrified in 1936, and automated in 1955. As the light was automated, positions for three keepers slowly dwindled down to two and then one. No longer housing lighthouse families by the 1960s, the keepers' house was rented to local residents. Eventually it was declared surplus, and St. Johns County bought it in 1970. In that year the house suffered a devastating fire at the hands of an unknown arsonist. Restoration In 1980, a small group of 15 women in the Junior Service League of St. Augustine (JSL) signed a 99-year lease with the county for the keeper's house and surrounding grounds and began a massive restoration project. Shortly after the JSL adopted the restoration, the League signed a 30-year lease with the Coast Guard to begin a restoration effort on the lighthouse tower itself. The lighthouse was subsequently placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 due to the efforts of local preservationist and author Karen Harvey. The antique lens was functional until it was damaged by rifle fire in 1986, and 19 of the prisms were broken. Lamplighter Hank Mears called the FBI to investigate this crime. As the lens continued to weaken, the Coast Guard considered removing it and replacing it with a more modern, airport beacon. Again championed by the JSL, this plan was dismissed and the -tall lens was restored, with the help of retired Coast Guardsmen Joe Cocking and Nick Johnston. This was the first restoration of its kind in the nation. Cocking and Johnston continue to work with Museum staff and care for the lens. Volunteers from Northrop Grumman Corporation and Florida Power & Light clean and inspect the lens and works every week. Today, the St. Augustine Light Station consists of the 1874 tower, the 1876 Keepers' House, two summer kitchens added in 1886, a 1941 U.S. Coast Guard barracks and a 1936 garage that was home to a jeep repair facility during World War II. The site is also a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather station. St. Augustine Lighthouse and Maritime Museum Visitors' Center View of the Keeper's House from the tower In 1994, the Lighthouse Museum of St. Augustine opened full-time to the public. A community-based board of trustees was created in 1998. The men and women of the volunteer board are charged with holding the site in trust for future generations. In 2002, under the direction of current Executive Director Kathy Fleming, ownership of the tower and historic Fresnel lens was transferred from the U.S. Coast Guard through the General Services Administration and the National Park Service to the St. Augustine Lighthouse and Museum, Inc. This was the first such transfer of a U.S. lighthouse to a non-profit organization. The Museum keeps the light burning as a private aid-to-navigation. In 2016 the museum changed its name to the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum. The St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum aims to preserve local maritime history, keep alive the story of the nation's oldest port, and connect young people to marine sciences. The museum board and staff also work to help save other lighthouses in Florida and across the nation, coordinating efforts with several federal agencies and volunteer groups such as the Florida Lighthouse Association. The Lighthouse employs close to 50 individuals, and is visited annually by over 200,000 people including 54,000 school-aged children. The museum maintains an active archaeological program (Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program, or LAMP) that researches maritime archaeological sites around St. Augustine and the First Coast region. Staff archaeologists have discovered a number of historic shipwrecks and investigated many others, along with other maritime sites such as breakwaters, plantation wharf remains, and the nearby remains of St. Augustine's original lighthouse. The museum also researches other aspects of maritime heritage including boat building and the history of the local and regional shrimping industry, and maintains a growing collection of World War II artifacts focusing on the history of the U.S. Coast Guard in St. Augustine. The Keeper's house is used to display a series of exhibits related to these various aspects of St. Augustine's maritime history. The Lighthouse also hosts a volunteer-driven heritage boat building program, which has built a number of traditional wooden boats from various time periods in the port's history. In early 2010, the First Light Maritime Society was established as the support organization for the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Museum and LAMP. The use of this fundraising organization was discontinued by the Lighthouse & Maritime Museum with its re-branding in 2016. =Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program (LAMP)= The St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum, as part of its ongoing mission to discover, present, and keep alive the maritime history of America's oldest port, has funded maritime archaeology in St. Johns County waters since 1997. In 1999, the Lighthouse formalized its research program, creating the Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program, Inc. (LAMP). LAMP is one of the few research organizations in the nation employing full-time professional marine archaeologists and conservators that is not a part of a university or government entity. LAMP's founding Director was William \\"Billy Ray\\" Morris, who oversaw archaeological research and educational programs until his departure in 2005. In March 2006, underwater archaeologist Chuck Meide took over control of the organization as its new Director, with the assistance of then Director of Archaeology Dr. Sam Turner. Today, LAMP maintains four archaeologists on staff and works with a team of archaeological conservators, and regularly employs a large number of volunteers and student interns. To date, the oldest identified shipwreck discovered in St. Augustine waters is the sloop Industry, a British supply ship lost on May 6, 1764, while attempting to make port with munitions, tools, and other equipment for the garrisons in Britain's recently acquired colony of Florida. Artifacts from the wreck site—including eight cast-iron cannon, an iron swivel gun, crates of iron shot, iron mooring anchors, millstones, and boxes of tools such as axes, shovel blades, knives, trowels, files, and handsaws—were well-preserved, and provided an unprecedented glimpse into the needs of British soldiers and administrators on the Florida frontier. Many of these items were recovered and conserved by LAMP archaeologists, and have been on display in the maritime museum in the Lighthouse keeper's house. LAMP archaeologist recording the ship's bell discovered on the 18th century \\"Storm Wreck.\\" In 2009, LAMP archaeologists discovered the second oldest shipwreck in northeast Florida waters, an unidentified colonial sailing vessel known as the \\"Storm Wreck\\". The wreck site, completely buried when initially discovered, has been subject to excavations each summer from 2010 to 2012, and seems to consist of scattered remnants of cargo, ship's equipment and components, military hardware, and personal possessions. LAMP archaeologists, along with volunteer and student divers, have documented and recovered a wide range of well- preserved artifacts, including numerous iron and copper cauldrons, pewter spoons and plates, an iron tea kettle, ceramic and glass fragments, belt and shoe buckles, a brass candlestick, bricks, a flintlock Queen Anne pistol, three Brown Bess muskets (two of which were loaded, one with buck and ball), thousands of lead shot, military buttons (including one from a Royal Provincial unit and one from the 71st Regiment of Foot, Fraser's Highlanders), a cask of nails, tools and navigational equipment (including a sight from an octant), ship's hardware and rigging elements, the ship's lead deck pump, a bronze ship's bell, a 4-pounder cannon, and a 9-pounder carronade, believed to be the second oldest in the world.A series of six papers on the excavation and analysis of the Storm Wreck are published in: Jordan, Brian; Nowak, Troy J. (editors) (2012). ACUA Underwater Archaeology Proceedings 2012. Baltimore, Maryland: Advisory Council on Underwater Archaeology. pp. 17-59. . After three seasons of excavation and laboratory analysis of artifacts, it is believed that this vessel was a ship involved in the December 18, 1782, evacuation of Charleston at the end of the American Revolution, carrying Loyalist refugees and troops to St. Augustine, which was a loyal British colony at the time. This was the final British fleet to leave Charleston, and when it arrived between December 24 and 31, 1782, as many as sixteen vessels were lost on the sandbar in front of the St. Augustine inlet. In 2015-2016 LAMP discovered three additional historic shipwrecks, and is currently excavating one of these that appears to date to the second half of the 18th century, the so-called \\"Anniversary Wreck.\\" LAMP has also excavated two historically significant 19th century wrecks: a wooden-hulled steamship, and a centerboard schooner. The identities of both wrecks remain unknown, but the study of their remains has led to a greater understanding of the economic and technological evolution of St. Augustine at the dawn of modernity. The latter shipwreck carried a cargo of cement in barrels which was probably intended for the city's late 19th century building boom, associated with industrialist entrepreneur Henry Flagler. In addition to these and other shipwrecks, LAMP has investigated a wide variety of archaeological sites in St. Augustine and the greater Florida First Coast region representing Florida's French, Spanish, British, and Early American periods. These include British plantation landings, community boatyard foundations, ferry and steamboat landings, ballast dump sites, colonial wharves, and inundated terrestrial sites. Current work includes the implementation of the First Coast Maritime Archaeology Project, a comprehensive program of research and outreach focusing on the waters around St. Augustine and elsewhere in northeast Florida. This project was partially funded from 2007-2009 and 2014-2019 by historic preservation grants awarded by the state of Florida. Ghost stories Looking down the staircase of the lighthouse The location is the subject of numerous ghost stories and supernatural legends, and the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum offers tickets for a number of \\"Dark of the Moon\\" ghost tours and ghost-themed private events to the public. According to ghost hunters, the lighthouse and surrounding buildings have a history of paranormal activity. The lighthouse has been featured in episodes of the Syfy television series Ghost Hunters, and also on the paranormal TV program My Ghost Story. Researcher Joe Nickell who investigated has written that there is no credible evidence the lighthouse is haunted. He noted that supposed spooky noises or sounds from the tower have mundane explanations such as seagulls or the wind.Nickell, Joe. (2012). The Science of Ghosts: Searching for Spirits of the Dead.

In other words, immunogenicity is the ability to induce a humoral and/or cell-mediated immune responses. Distinction is made between wanted and unwanted immunogenicity: * Wanted immunogenicity is typically related with vaccines, where the injection of an antigen (the vaccine) provokes an immune response against the pathogen (virus, bacteria), protecting the organism from future exposure. Vaccine development is a complex multi-step process, with immunogenicity being at the center of vaccine efficacy. * Unwanted immunogenicity is an immune response by an organism against a therapeutic antigen (ex. recombinant protein, or monoclonal antibody). This reaction leads to production of anti-drug-antibodies (ADAs) inactivating the therapeutic effects of the treatment and, in rare cases, inducing adverse effects. A challenge in biotherapy is predicting the immunogenic potential of novel protein therapeutics. For example, immunogenicity data from high-income countries are not always transferable to low-income and middle-income countries. Another challenge is considering how the immunogenicity of vaccines changes with age. Therefore, as stated by the World Health Organization, immunogenicity should be investigated in a target population since animal testing and in-vitro models cannot precisely predict immune response in humans.  Antigenic immunogenic potency  Many lipids and nucleic acids are relatively small molecules and/or have non-immunogenic properties. Consequently, they may require conjugation with an epitope such as a protein or polysaccharide to increase immunogenic potency so that they can evoke an immune response. * Proteins and few polysaccharides have immunogenic properties, which allows them to induce humoral immune responses. * Proteins and some lipids/glycolypids can serve as immunogens for cell-mediated immunity. * Proteins are significantly more immunogenic than polysaccharides.  Antigen characteristics  Immunogenicity is influenced by multiple characteristics of an antigen: * Phylogenetic distance * Molecular size * Epitope density * Chemical composition and heterogeneity :* Protein structure :* Synthetic polymers :* D-amino acids * Degradability (ability to be processed & presented as MHC peptide to T cells) T cell epitopes  T cell epitope content is one of the factors that contributes to antigenicity. Likewise, T Cell epitopes can cause unwanted immunogenicity, including the development of ADAs. A key determinant in T cell epitope immunogenicity is the binding strength of T cell epitopes to major histocompatibility complexes (MHC or HLA) molecules. Epitopes with higher binding affinities are more likely to be displayed on the surface of a cell. Because a T cell's T cell receptor recognizes a specific epitope, only certain T cells are able to respond to a certain peptide bound to MHC on a cell surface. When protein drug therapeutics, (as in enzymes, monoclonals, replacement proteins) or vaccines are administrated, antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as a B cell or Dendritic Cell, will present these substances as peptides, which T cells may recognize. This may result in unwanted immunogenicity, including ADAs and autoimmmune diseases, such as autoimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP) following exposure to recombinant thrombopoietin and pure red cell aplasia, which was associated with a particular formulation of erythropoietin (Eprex).  Monoclonal antibodies  Factors affecting Immunogenicity of Monoclonal Antibodies Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are used for several diseases, including cancer and Rheumatoid arthritis. Consequently, the high immunogenicity limited efficacy and was associated with severe infusion reactions. Although the exact mechanism is unclear, it is suspected that the mAbs are inducing infusion reactions by eliciting antibody antigen interactions, such as increased formation of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, which may bind onto mast cells and subsequent degranulation, causing allergy-like symptoms as well as the release of additional cytokines. Several innovations in genetic engineering has resulted in the decrease in immunogenicity, (also known as deimmunization), of mAbs. Genetic engineering has led to the generation of humanized and chimeric antibodies, by exchanging the murine constant and complementary regions of the immunoglobulin chains with the human counterparts. Although this has reduced the sometimes extreme immunogenicity associated with murine mAbs, the anticipation that all fully human mAbs would have not possess unwanted immunogenic properties remains unfulfilled. Evaluation methods =In silico screening= T cell epitope content, which is one of the factors that contributes to the risk of immunogenicity can now be measured relatively accurately using in silico tools. Immunoinformatics algorithms for identifying T-cell epitopes are now being applied to triage protein therapeutics into higher risk and low risk categories. These categories refer to assessing and analyzing whether an immunotherapy or vaccine will cause unwanted immunogenicity. One approach is to parse protein sequences into overlapping nonamer (that is, 9 amino acid) peptide frames, each of which is then evaluated for binding potential to each of six common class I HLA alleles that “cover” the genetic backgrounds of most humans worldwide. By calculating the density of high-scoring frames within a protein, it is possible to estimate a protein's overall “immunogenicity score”. In addition, sub-regions of densely packed high scoring frames or “clusters” of potential immunogenicity can be identified, and cluster scores can be calculated and compiled. Using this approach, the clinical immunogenicity of a novel protein therapeutics can be calculated. Consequently, a number of biotech companies have integrated in silico immunogenicity into their pre-clinical process as they develop new protein drugs.

The Second Episcopal Conference of Latin America was a bishops' conference held in 1968 in Medellín, Colombia, as a follow-up to the Second Vatican Council which it adapted in a creative way to the Latin American context. It took as the theme for its 16 documents “The Church in the Present Transformation of Latin America in the Light of the Council\\", with a focus on the poor and oppressed in society. It recognized that “the social situation demands an efficacious presence of the Church that goes beyond the promotion of personal holiness by preaching and the sacraments.”Jorge Mejía, “El pequeño Concilio de Medellín,” Criterio 41 (1968): 688. The bishops agreed that the church should take \\"a preferential option for the poor\\" and gave their approval to Christian \\"base communities\\" in which the poor might learn to read by reading the Bible. The goal of the bishops was to liberate the people from the \\"institutionalized violence\\" of poverty. They maintained that poverty and hunger were preventable.  History  In 1931, Pope Pius XI had put forward a vague plan for a sort of moderate corporatism. However, he also pushed for both Catholic and secular labor unions. Though these unions were likely more akin to medieval guilds in the Pope's vision, unions at this time were beginning to be associated with workers' rights and class struggles. By the 1950s and 1960s, Christian Democratic parties and Catholic labor associations were on the rise. Members were tasked with bringing Christian values and principles into public life. Papal teachings emphasized the “re-Christianizing” of society based on cooperation for the common good. While the Christian Democratic Parties began advertising their “Third Way” as an alternative to both capitalism and socialism, a divide formed within the Christian Democratic Parties between the “liberationists” and the moderate conservatives who were in control. The Latin American Episcopal Council (Spanish: Consejo Episcopal Latinoamericano), also known as CELAM, organized the conference in Medellin in order to give direction to the Church in Latin America. In an introductory statement the bishops wrote: The reform movement drew on the influence of Paulo Freire, widely regarded as the greatest literacy teacher of the region, along with Father Camilo Torres and Bartolomé de Las Casas. It allowed for the poor to object to the hegemony and hierarchy they had been subjected to for the past centuries. Instead of accepting only what they were given, the people could now demand more, like soup kitchens, day care, co-ops, neighborhood organizations, higher wages, better medical care, and greater self-respect. The bishops and religious sisters who took part in this effort were hoping that the \\"religious fervor\\" of the region would help make the result extremely powerful. They rejected for Latin America the model of development imposed by international organizations along with the national governments and economically powerful groups. The poor were to become active agents in the political and economic spheres. Bishop Dom Hélder Câmara called for a \\"structural revolution\\" which would allow for integral development and the full flourishing of every human person. Pope Paul VI had spoken of \\"just insurrection\\" and the possible use of violent rebellion in certain situations. The Medellin Conference in 1968 opened the way for the development of liberation theology, and endorsed the formation of base communities under lay leaders approved by the pastor. As base communities greatly multiplied, critics would complain of Marxist ideology and propensity toward violent confrontation. In 1978 Pope John Paul II, a staunch opponent of Communism in his native Poland, diminished the influence of liberation theology by appointing in Latin America only conservative bishops. Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, later Pope Benedict XVI, as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, was in charge of enforcing doctrine which largely opposed the theological interpretations and actions of the liberationists. In 1983 the Pope visited Nicaragua and expressed his belief that there is a fundamental difference between Catholic and Sandinista ideology, something which they vehemently deny.  Tension in Medellin documents  It was common to see the contradictory nature of the documents from the 1968 conference as the new liberationist movement overtaking the older, developmentalist thought which has been described as follows:William T. Cavanaugh. \\"\\"The Ecclesiologies of Medellin and the Lessons of the Base Communities\\"\\" Cross Currents Vol. 44 Iss. 1 (1994) In contrast to this, the liberationist model denounces the political-economic model now in place as \\"institutionalized violence\\", which must be \\"conquer[ed] by means of a dynamic action of awakening (concientización) and organization of the popular sectors\\" (Peace, 16, 18).The more conservative bishops at Medellin continued to see themselves as the protectors of the masses, while the poor masses were being encouraged to become literate and take control of their own destiny. Such literacy and mass action was fostered by the publication in Brazil of Paulo Friere's Pedagogy of the Oppressed, and given support in the Council's document on education (8). Gustavo Gutiérrez, the author of A Theology of Liberation (1973), sees the tension in the documents of Medellin as arising in the bishops' attempt to reach all Latin American communities, no matter where they stood, and begin introducing more liberationist views.Gutiérrez, Gustavo.

Rodgers, Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (2000) The concept covered mechanical, economic, social, and personal improvement.Samuel Haber, Efficiency and Uplift: Scientific Management in the Progressive Era, 1890–1920 (1964) The quest for efficiency promised effective, dynamic management rewarded by growth.Jennifer K. Alexander, The Mantra of Efficiency: From Waterwheel to Social Control (2008) As a result of the influence of an early proponent, it is more often known as Taylorism. United States The Efficiency Movement played a central role in the Progressive Era in the United States, where it flourished 1890–1932.Haber (1964) Adherents argued that all aspects of the economy, society and government were riddled with waste and inefficiency. Everything would be better if experts identified the problems and fixed them. The result was strong support for building research universities and schools of business and engineering, municipal research agencies, as well as reform of hospitals and medical schools, and the practice of farming.W. J. Spillman, \\"The Efficiency Movement in Its Relation to Agriculture\\", Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol. 59, (May, 1915), pp. 65–76 in JSTOR Perhaps the best known leaders were engineers Frederick Winslow Taylor (1856–1915), who used a stopwatch to identify the smallest inefficiencies, and Frank Bunker Gilbreth Sr. (1868–1924) who proclaimed there was always \\"one best way\\" to fix a problem. Leaders including Herbert Croly, Charles R. van Hise and Richard Ely sought to improve governmental performance by training experts in public service comparable to those in Germany, notably at the Universities of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Schools of business administration set up management programs oriented toward efficiency.Stuart Morris, \\"The Wisconsin Idea and Business Progressivism,\\" Journal of American Studies, April 1970, Vol. 4#1 pp. 39–60 =Municipal and state efficiency= Many cities set up \\"efficiency bureaus\\" to identify waste and apply the best practices. For example, Chicago created an Efficiency Division (1910–16) within the city government's Civil Service Commission, and private citizens organized the Chicago Bureau of Public Efficiency (1910–32). The former pioneered the study of \\"personal efficiency,\\" measuring employees' performance through new scientific merit systems and efficiency movement Mordecai Lee, Bureaus of Efficiency: Reforming Local Government in the Progressive Era, (Marquette University Press, 2008) State governments were active as well. For example, Massachusetts set up its \\"Commission on Economy and Efficiency\\" in 1912. It made hundreds of recommendations.Commission on Economy and Efficiency, Annual report of the Commission on Economy and Efficiency (Boston, 1913), p 76 online =Philanthropy= Leading philanthropists such as Andrew CarnegieAbigail A. Van Slyck, Free to All: Carnegie Libraries & American Culture, 1890–1920 (1998) p. 1 and John D. Rockefeller actively promoted the efficiency movement. In his many philanthropic pursuits, Rockefeller believed in supporting efficiency. He said, > To help an inefficient, ill-located, unnecessary school is a waste ...it is > highly probable that enough money has been squandered on unwise educational > projects to have built up a national system of higher education adequate to > our needs, if the money had been properly directed to that end.John D. > Rockefeller, Random Reminiscences of Men and Events (1933) =Conservation= The conservation movement regarding national resources came to prominence during the Progressive Era. According to historian Samuel P. Hays, the conservation movement was based on the \\"gospel of the efficiency\\".Samuel P. Hays, Conservation and the Gospel of Efficiency: The Progressive Conservation Movement 1890–1920 (1959). The Massachusetts Commission on Economy and Efficiency reflected the new concern with conservation. It said in 1912: President Roosevelt was the nation's foremost conservationist, putting the issue high on the national agenda by emphasizing the need to eliminate wasteful uses of limited natural resources. He worked with all the major figures of the movement, especially his chief advisor on the matter, Gifford Pinchot. Roosevelt was deeply committed to conserving natural resources, and is considered to be the nation's first conservation President.W. Todd Benson, President Theodore Roosevelt's Conservation Legacy (2003) 1908 US editorial cartoon on Theodore Roosevelt and conservation In 1908, Roosevelt sponsored the Conference of Governors held in the White House, with a focus on natural resources and their most efficient use. Roosevelt delivered the opening address: \\"Conservation as a National Duty\\". In contrast, environmentalist John Muir promulgated a very different view of conservation, rejecting the efficiency motivation. Muir instead preached that nature was sacred and humans are intruders who should look but not develop. Working through the Sierra Club he founded, Muir tried to minimize commercial use of water resources and forests.Roderick Nash, Wilderness and the American Mind (3rd ed. 1982), pp. 122–40 While Muir wanted nature preserved for the sake of pure beauty, Roosevelt subscribed to Pinchot's formulation, \\"to make the forest produce the largest amount of whatever crop or service will be most useful, and keep on producing it for generation after generation of men and trees.\\" Gifford Pinchot, Breaking New Ground (1947) p. 32. =National politics= In U.S. national politics, the most prominent figure was Herbert Hoover, a trained engineer who played down politics and believed dispassionate, nonpolitical experts could solve the nation's great problems, such as ending poverty.William J. Barber, From new era to New Deal: Herbert Hoover, the economists, and American economic policy, 1921–1933 (1989) p. 5 After 1929, Democrats blamed the Great Depression on Hoover and helped to somewhat discredit the movement. =Antitrust= Boston lawyer Louis Brandeis (1856–1941) argued bigness conflicted with efficiency and added a new political dimension to the Efficiency Movement. For instance, while fighting against legalized price fixing, Brandeis launched an effort to influence congressional policymaking with the help of his friend Norman Hapgood, who was then the editor of Harper's Weekly. He coordinated the publication of a series of articles (Competition Kills, Efficiency and the One-Price Article, and How Europe deals with the one-price goods), which were also distributed by the lobbying group American Fair Trade League to legislators, Supreme Court justices, governors, and twenty national magazines. For his works, he was asked to speak before a congressional committee considering the price-fixing bill he drafted. Here, he stated that \\"big business is not more efficient than little business\\" and that \\"it is a mistake to suppose that the department stores can do business cheaper than the little dealer.\\" Brandeis ideas on which business is most efficient conflicted with Croly's positions, which favored efficiency driven by a kind of consolidation gained through large- scale economic operations. As early as 1895 Brandeis had warned of the harm that giant corporations could do to competitors, customers, and their own workers. The growth of industrialization was creating mammoth companies which he felt threatened the well-being of millions of Americans.Melvin I. Urofsky, Louis D. Brandeis: a life (2009) pp. 300–26 In The Curse of Bigness he argued, \\"Efficiency means greater production with less effort and at less cost, through the elimination of unnecessary waste, human and material. How else can we hope to attain our social ideals?\\"Louis Brandeis, The curse of bigness: miscellaneous papers of Louis D. Brandeis edited by Osmond Kessler Fraenkel and Clarence Martin Lewis, (1965) p. 51 He also argued against an appeal to Congress by the state-regulated railroad industry in 1910 seeking an increase in rates. Brandeis explained that instead of passing along increased costs to the consumer, the railroads should pursue efficiency by reducing their overhead and streamlining their operations, initiatives that were unprecedented during the time. =Bedaux system= The Bedaux system, developed by Franco-American management consultant Charles Bedaux (1886–1944) built on the work of F. W. Taylor and Charles E. Knoeppel.Edward Francis Leopold Brech, Productivity in Perspective, 1914-1974 (Bristol: Thoemmes Press, 2002).Michael R. Weatherburn, 'Scientific Management at Work: the Bedaux System, Management Consulting, and Worker Efficiency in British Industry, 1914-48' (Imperial College PhD thesis, 2014). Its distinctive advancement beyond these earlier thinkers was the Bedaux Unit or B, a universal measure for all manual work.Craig R. Littler, Development of the Labour Process in Capitalist Societies: a Comparative Study of the Transformation of Work Organization in Britain, Japan and the USA (London: Heinemann, 1982) entry on Google Books The Bedaux System was influential in the United States in the 1920s and Europe in the 1930s and 1940s, especially in Britain.Steven Kreis, 'Charles E. Bedaux' in American National Biography onlineSteven Kreis, 'The Diffusion of Scientific Management: the Bedaux Company in America and Britain, 1926-1945' in A Mental Revolution: Scientific Management Since Taylor (1992) From the 1920s to the 1950s there were about one thousand companies in 21 countries worldwide that were run on the Bedaux System, including giants such as Swift's, Eastman Kodak, B.F. Goodrich, DuPont, Fiat, ICI and General Electric.Patricia Tisdall, Agents of Change: The Development and Practice of Management Consultancy (London: Heinemann, 1982).Matthias Kipping, 'Consultancies, Institutions and the Diffusion of Taylorism in Britain, Germany and France, 1920s to 1950s', Business History (1997) PDF from Taylor & Francis onlineMichael Ferguson, The Rise of Management Consulting in Britain (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2002)'Christopher D. McKenna, The World's Newest Profession: Management Consulting in the Twentieth Century (Cambridge: CUP, 2010). Cambridge University Press =Relation to other movements= Later movements had echoes of the Efficiency Movement and were more directly inspired by Taylor and Taylorism. Technocracy, for instance, and others flourished in the 1930s and 1940s. Postmodern opponents of nuclear energy in the 1970s broadened their attack to try to discredit movements that saw salvation for human society in technical expertise alone, or which held that scientists or engineers had any special expertise to offer in the political realm. Coming into usage in 1990, the Western term lean manufacturing (lean enterprise, lean production, or simply \\"lean\\") refers to a business idea that considered the expenditure of resources for anything other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful, and thus a target for elimination. Today the Lean concept is broadening to include a greater range of strategic goals, not just cost-cutting and efficiency. Britain In engineering, the concept of efficiency was developed in Britain in the mid-18th century by John Smeaton (1724–1792). Called the \\"father of civil engineering\\", he studied water wheels and steam engines.Alexander (2008) ch. 1 In the late 19th century there was much talk about improving the efficiency of the administration and economic performance of the British Empire.Arnold White, Efficiency and empire (1901). National Efficiency was an attempt to discredit the old-fashioned habits, customs and institutions that put the British at a handicap in competition with the world, especially with Germany,W.H. Dawson, The German Workman: a Study in National Efficiency (1906) online which was seen as the epitome of efficiency.G. R. Searle, The Quest for National Efficiency, 1899–1914: A Study in Politics and Political Thought (Oxford UP, 1971) In the early 20th century, \\"National Efficiency\\" became a powerful demand — a movement supported by prominent figures across the political spectrum who disparaged sentimental humanitarianism and identified waste as a mistake that could no longer be tolerated. The movement took place in two waves; the first wave from 1899 to 1905 was made urgent by the inefficiencies and failures in the Second Boer War (1899–1902). Spectator magazine reported in 1902 there was \\"a universal outcry for efficiency in all departments of society, in all aspects of life\\".G. R. Searle, \\"The Politics of National Efficiency and of War, 1900–1918\\" in Chris Wrigley, ed., A Companion to Early 20th-Century Britain (Blackwell, 2003) p. 56 The two most important themes were technocratic efficiency and managerial efficiency. As White (1899) argued vigorously, the empire needed to be put on a business footing and administered to get better results. The looming threat of Germany, which was widely seen as a much more efficient nation, added urgency after 1902. Politically National Efficiency brought together modernizing Conservatives and Unionists, Liberals who wanted to modernize their party, and Fabians such as George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells, along with Beatrice and Sidney Webb, who had outgrown socialism and saw the utopia of a scientifically up-to-date society supervised by experts such as themselves. Churchill in 1908 formed an alliance with the Webbs, announcing the goal of a \\"National Minimum\\", covering hours, working conditions, and wages – it was a safety net below which the individual would not be allowed to fall.James T. Kloppenberg, Uncertain Victory: Social Democracy and Progressivism in European and American Thought, 1870–1920 (1988) p 475Henry Pelling, Winston Churchill (1989) p. 104 Representative legislation included the Education Act of 1902, which emphasized the role of experts in the schools system. Higher education was an important initiative, typified by the growth of the London School of Economics, and the foundation of Imperial College.Searle (1971) There was a pause in the movement between 1904 and 1909, when interest resumed. The most prominent new leaders included Liberals Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George, whose influence brought a bundle of reform legislation that introduced the welfare state to Britain. Much of the popular and elite support for National Efficiency grew out of concern for Britain's military position, especially with respect to Germany. The Royal Navy underwent a dramatic modernization, most famously in the introduction of the Dreadnought, which in 1906 revolutionized naval warfare overnight. Germany In Germany the efficiency movement was called \\"rationalization\\" and it was a powerful social and economic force before 1933. In part it looked explicitly at American models, especially Fordism.Mary Nolan, \\"Housework Made Easy: the Taylorized Housewife in Weimar Germany's Rationalized Economy,\\" Feminist Studies. Volume: 16. Issue: 3. pp 549+ The Bedaux system was widely adopted in the rubber and tire industry, despite strong resistance in the socialist labor movement to the Bedaux system. Continental AG, the leading rubber company in Germany, adopted the system and profited heavily from it, thus surviving the Great Depression relatively undamaged and improving its competitive capabilities. However most German businessmen preferred the home-grown REFA system which focused on the standardization of working conditions, tools, and machinery.Paul Erker, \\"Das Bedaux-System: Neue Aspekte der Historischen Rationalisierungsforschung,[\\"The Bedaux system: new aspects of research on the history of rationalization\\"], Zeitschrift für Unternehmensgeschichte, 1996, Vol. 41#2 pp 139–158 \\"Rationalization\\" meant higher productivity and greater efficiency, promising science would bring prosperity. More generally it promised a new level of modernity and was applied to economic production and consumption as well as public administration. Various versions of rationalization were promoted by industrialists and Social Democrats, by engineers and architects, by educators and academics, by middle class feminists and social workers, by government officials and politicians of many parties. It was ridiculed by the extremists in the Communist movement. As ideology and practice, rationalization challenged and transformed not only machines, factories, and vast business enterprises but also the lives of middle-class and working-class Germans.Nolan (1975) Soviet Union Ideas of Science Management was very popular in the Soviet Union. One of the leading theorists and practitioners of the Scientific Management in Soviet Russia was Alexei Gastev. The Central Institute of Labour (Tsentralnyi Institut Truda, or TsIT), founded by Gastev in 1921 with Vladimir Lenin's support, was a veritable citadel of socialist Taylorism. Fascinated by Taylorism and Fordism, Gastev has led a popular movement for the “scientific organization of labor” (Nauchnaya Organizatsiya Truda, or NOT). Because of its emphasis on the cognitive components of labor, some scholars consider Gastev’s NOT to represent a Marxian variant of cybernetics. As with the concept of 'Organoprojection' (1919) by Pavel Florensky, underlying Nikolai Bernstein and Gastev's approach, lay a powerful man-machine metaphor. Japan W. Edwards Deming (1900–1993) brought the efficiency movement to Japan after World War II, teaching top management how to improve design (and thus service), product quality, testing and sales (the last through global markets), especially using statistical methods. Deming then brought his methods back to the U.S. in the form of quality control called continuous improvement process.Andrea Gabor, The Man Who Discovered Quality: How W.

The Raja Passenger Train Company is an associate of the IR,Sources: *, company website * and manages its passenger trains. The Railway Transportation Company is an associate of the IR, which manages its freight transport. The Ministry of Roads & Urban Development is the state agency that oversees the IRIR. Some 33 million tonnes of goods and 29 million passengers are transported annually by the rail transportation network, accounting for 9 percent and 11 percent of all transportation in Iran, respectively (2011).  History  = Qajar dynasty = Narrow-gauge railway Tehran – Rey In 1886, during the time of Nasser-al-Din Shah, an 8.7 km horse- driven suburban railway was established south of Tehran, which was later converted to steam. This line was closed in 1952. The First Iranian railway was set up in 1887 between Mahmudabad and Amol; its construction was completely private. However it was not used because of several problems.Persia and the Persian Question The Tabriz–Jolfa line (146 km) was built in 1914, the Sufiyan–Sharafkhaneh line (53 km) in 1916, and the Mirjaveh–Zahedan line (93 km) in 1920. =World War II= The long Trans-Iranian Railway from Bandar Shah (now Bandar Torkaman) on the Caspian Sea to Bandar Shahpur (now Bandar-e Emam Khomeyni) on the Persian Gulf was opened during the reign of Reza Shah Pahlavi in 1939. The railroad was built with rail weighing and required more than 3000 bridges. There were 126 tunnels in the Zagros mountains, the longest of which was . Grades averaged 1.5 percent south of Tehran, but then increased to 2.8 percent to cross the pass between Tehran and the Caspian Sea. =Anglo- Soviet Invasion of Iran= After the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in 1941, this Persian Corridor became one of the supply routes for war material for the Soviet Union during World War II (Railway trend in Iran). The invading British built a branch line from the bridge over the Karun River in Ahvaz to a new southern port at Khorramshahr on the Arvand Rud river. In 1943, 3,473 American soldiers of the Military Railway Service began running trains between the Persian Gulf and Caspian Sea using ALCO RS-1 locomotives rebuilt with 3-axle trucks and designated RSD-1.Pinkepank, Jerry A. The Second Diesel Spotter's Guide 1973 Kalmbach Books p.233 The Americans set up headquarters in Ahvaz, but were unable to tolerate the daytime heat, and generally operated the railway at night.DeNevi & Hall United States Military Railway Service (1992) Boston Mills Press pp.8&73-77 The Persian Gulf Command ran trains day and night. \\"Persian Gulf Command\\" by Joel Sayre 1945, Random House =Challenging construction= The Trans-Iranian railway traverses many mountain ranges, and is full of spirals and 1 in 36 (2.78%) ruling grades. Much of the terrain was unmapped when construction took place, and its geology unknown. Several stretches of line, including tunnels, were built through unsuitable geology, and had to be replaced before the line opened. Nevertheless, the line was completed ahead of schedule. In recent years the railways have undergone significant extensions including the 1977 linking to the western railway system at the Turkish border, the 1993 opening of the Bandar Abbas line providing better access to the sea, and the 1996 opening of the Mashad–Sarakhs extension as part of the Silk Road railway to link to the landlocked Central Asian Countries. =Railway construction= Following the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, American and British railroad crews pose alongside a locomotive, ca. 1943 Do Ab, Mazanderan Province on the Gorgan — Bandar Shah line, 2007 In December 2014, a rail line from Iran opened to Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. The opening of the line marks the first direct rail link between Iran, Kazakhstan and China, and upon completion of the Marmaray rail project direct rail transport between China and Europe (while avoiding Russia) will be possible.Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan-Iran Railway to Open Today, by Onur Uysal, http://railturkey.org/2014/12/03/kazakhstan-turkmenistan-iran-railway/ { |-- !

Trains are operated with diesel and electric locomotives. Steam locomotives have been phased out. Diesel is a strategic industry, and by using this heavy oil as a fuel instead of gas for locomotives, the Islamic Republic of Iran has joined the 12 world countries which manufacture this type of engine. Operations In 2008, the IR operated 11,106 km of rail with a further 18,900 km in various stages of development. Almost all of this is standard gauge of , but 94 km are Russian gauge of to link up to ex-Soviet Union border states. There is also the no-longer-isolated Indian gauge section of from Zahedan to the Pakistan border that continues to Quetta and the Indian sub-continent. The extent of double-track lines is 1,082 km. The Jolfa–Tabriz line is electrified( 148 km). In 2006, IR reported that it possessed 565 engines, 1,192 passenger coaches, and 16,330 wagons. The vast majority of the engines are diesel-powered. =Expansion= right The majority of transportation in Iran is road-based. The government plans to transport 3.5% of the passenger volume and 8.5% of the freight volume by rail. Extensive electrification is planned. The railway network expands by about 500 km per year according to the Ministry of R&T.; According to plan, Iran’s railway lines are to reach 15,000 kilometers by 2015 and 25,000 kilometers by the year 2025. The State Railways Company has 300 locomotives with an average lifespan of 40 years. The Islamic Republic of Iran Railways, the Iran Power Plant Projects Management (Mapna) and Germany's Siemens have signed a contract for 150 IranRunner locomotives for passenger trains. Siemens is committed to exporting to Iran some 30 locomotives in the first phase, and to manufacturing another 120 using domestic capacities and expertise over the next 6 years (2007). MLC (Mapna Locomotive Engineering and Manufacturing Company) is the manufacturing company responsible for this production. Another locomotive manufacturer in Iran is Wagon Pars which builds AD43C locomotives in partnership with Iranian power plant maker DESA diesel. In 2009, €17 billion in foreign investment in the rail industry has been secured, according to the Ministry of Road and Transportation of Iran.right Affiliate companies *Raja Passenger Train Company is an associate of the Islamic Republic of Iran Railways (IRIR) and manages its passenger trains, including international trains linking Tehran to Istanbul and Damascus. Raja Passenger Train Company carried more than 4 million passengers during 2003-05. The number of passengers traveling by rail increased from 11.7 million in 2000 to 17.3 million in the year ending March 2005. Every passenger wagon annually carries 7,340 passengers per kilometer on average (whereas the figure is 3,950 people per kilometer in Turkey and 5,220 passengers per kilometer in Egypt). Private enterprises are expected to operate 5,000 wagons by 2009 (50% of total). *Railway Transportation Company is also a subsidiary of the IRIR which manages its freight transport while the Ministry of Roads and Transportation is the state agency that oversees the IRIR. In Iran, for every wagon, some 1,050 tons of freight are being transported (2008). The cargo rail system between Iran, Turkey and Pakistan will begin regular operations by August 2010. *Zarand Company provides the national railroad system with freight and passenger train carriages. Network and corridors The railway network converges on Tehran. The Iranian cities of Isfahan and Shiraz were linked to Tehran in 2009. Further extension of this line to Bushehr and Bandar Abbas is planned. Furthermore, the construction of Chabahar-Zahedan-Mashhad railway, extending from southeast to northeast of the country to the length of 1,350 kilometers, started in 2010 with 3 billion euro credit. The western railway extension links to Turkey at the Rāzī–Kapıköy border. There is a northern connection to Azerbaijan, the Caucasus, and Russia has a bogie-changing station at the border at Jolfa. The southern routes connect Tehran to the Persian Gulf ports of Bandar Imam and Bandar Abbas. A line to the Caspian Sea ends at the terminal of Amir Abad and at Bandar Torkaman, and is part of a North-South corridor to Russia and Scandinavia. The north-east corridor connects Mashhad and continues further to the bogie-changing station at Sarakhs. For the landlocked countries of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan this line provides access to the sea. A recent connection from Mashhad to Bafq has significantly shortened access to the port city of Bandar Abbas. Tehran-Mashhad with a length of 900 kilometers, Tehran-Qom-Esfahan with a length of 410 kilometers (under construction), Qazvin-Rasht-Anzali-Astara with a length of 370 kilometers; will all be built with help from China at a cost of $12 billion. In total, Iran has signed a number of contracts with China for the development of 5,000 kilometres of railway lines. =North-South Railway= The North-South railway is complete between Qazvin and Bandar Abbas; the line was expected to be completed as far as Azerbaijan by the end of 2016. Qazvin to Astara is the missing link in the North-South Transportation Corridor, which links India, Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia and Finland. Qazvin Rasht railway was completed in 2018 and Rasht Astara railway needs another four years to be completed. =Links to Azerbaijan and Armenia= Iran's first rail link to the outside world appeared simultaneously with the beginning of the country's railway system, as Iran's first major railway (1916) connected Tabriz with Jolfa on the border with the Russian Empire. The link continued its importance throughout the USSR era; Iran and the USSR signed an agreement on cross-border rail transport in 1940, and amended it in 1958.СОГЛАШЕНИЕ О СОВЕТСКО-ИРАНСКОМ ЖЕЛЕЗНОДОРОЖНОМ СООБЩЕНИИ (МОСКВА, 20 ЯНВАРЯ 1958 Г.) (Agreement on Soviet-Iranian railway communications; Moscow, 20 January 1958) It is reported that during the late- Soviet era, some 350 railcars crossed the border at Jolfa daily, with the annual amount of cross-border freight reaching 3.5 million tons.На торговом пути «Север — Юг» (The North-South trade route) However, after the breakup of the USSR and the closing of the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan the Jolfa connection became a dead end, as it only links Iran with the isolated Nakhichevan exclave of the Republic of Azerbaijan.Georgia to remain vital transit route for Armenia . Quote: \\"However, there are no expectations that in the near future there will be a resolution of the Karabakh conflict and the railroads connecting Armenia and Azerbaijan - Yerevan-Nakhichevan-Baku and Ichevan-Baku - will begin operating.\\" In 2007, Iranian Railways, Azerbaijan State Railway and Russian Railways agreed on implementing the project to build a new line between Qazvin, Resht, Astara, Iran and Astara, Azerbaijan. In April 2017, Russia and India celebrated 70 years of diplomatic relations and vowed to complete the North-South Transportation Corridor (NSTC) with the help of Iran. The NSTC reduces time and cost of travel by 30-40%.North–South Transport CorridorThere is presently no direct railway connection between Iran and Armenia, even though the two countries share a border. In 2009, Iran and Armenia agreed to build a railway linking Armenia with Iran’s Persian Gulf ports. =Links to Central Asia= In 1996, Mashhad–Sarakhs extension connected Iran to Turkmenistan,as part of the Silk Road railway to link to the landlocked Central Asian Countries.Former states of the Soviet Union have railways using a Russian gauge,thus the Iranian Railways maintain break-of- gauge services at borders to Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan,and beyond brief wide-track rail segments to the border crossing.The Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan- Iran railway link is a part of the North-South Transport Corridor and is a long railway line connecting the Central Asian countries of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan with Iran and the Persian Gulf.It will link Uzen in Kazakhstan with Bereket - Etrek in Turkmenistan and end at Gorgan in Iran's Golestan province.In Iran,the railway will be linked to national network making its way to the ports of the Persian Gulf.The project is estimated to cost $620m which is being jointly funded by the governments of Kazakhstan,Turkmenistan and Iran. =Links to Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan= right Feasibility studies were started on Khorramshahr-Basra and Kermanshah-Baghdad links with Iraq. , the Iranian line to Khorramshahr was finished, but construction had not started on the track from the Iraqi border to Basra. In 2017, the West Corridor was expanded from Arak to Malayer and Kermanshah. The Iranian government plans on expanding the network further to Khosravi (Iran-Iraq) border by 2018. Mashhad-Khvaf-Afghanistan's Border-Islam Qala railway is being constructed by an Iranian firm, with funding from the Afghan government, but the section in Afghanistan remains incomplete. = Link to Turkey, and International Standard Gauge route to Europe = In 1977, the Iranian railways linked to the western railway system at the Turkish border. The route to the west into Turkey terminates at Van with a train ferry for both freight wagons and international passenger traffic (baggage car only) across Lake Van, which is at an altitude of , to Tatvan where it joins the Turkish standard-gauge network. = Link to Pakistan = The construction of the railway from Bam to Zahedan was completed in early 2009 connecting Tehran to Pakistan border with an opening ceremony on 19 July 2009. However international container traffic commenced operations on 14 August 2009 with transshipment (or transloading) between and wagons in the Gulf, Western Texas and Pacific Railway Zahedan Exchange Yard on the bypass line. The freight traffic was discontinued however after the initial trial trains, and was only revived in 2015. Iranian Railways have been trying to persuade Pakistan Railways to convert its route to Quetta to standard gauge, in order to facilitate the flow of international traffic to Europe. Pakistan responded in 2006 with a statement that it is to convert its network to standard gauge, and would plan a link with the standard gauge system of China. A through passenger service is being considered to supplement the occasional Quetta-Zahedan service, itself a poor shadow of the former Pakistan-Iran 'Taftan Express'. = International railway links with neighboring countries = * Afghanistan-no link-break-of-gauge -railway link to Afghanistan is being built using standard gauge. * Armenia-no link-break- of-gauge . * Azerbaijan-open-break-of-gauge -only via the Azerbaijani exclave Nakhchivan; a railway link to Azerbaijan proper is being built. * Iraq-no link\\\\- standard gauge. * Pakistan-open-break-of-gauge . * Turkey-open\\\\- standard gauge. * Turkmenistan-open-break-of-gauge.. Railway electrification Although railway electrification in Iran was started in 1975, it was halted for almost 30 years. A contract for electrification of the Tehran-Mashhad double-track line and the supply of 70 electric locomotives was awarded in 2009. Speeds of up to 200 km/h for locomotive-hauled passenger trains and 250 km/h for tilting EMUs are expected to reduce existing journey times of 7.5 to 12 to less than 5 hours. As recently as July 2017 the Iranian Government has completed a loan agreement for the Tehran – Mashhad electrification project. Works on this project are expected to begin shortly.

It is endemic to California, growing in interior valleys and foothills from Siskiyou County to San Diego County. Mature specimens may attain an age of up to 600 years. This deciduous oak requires year-round access to groundwater. Its thick, ridged bark is characteristic and resembles alligator hide. The valley oak's deeply lobed leaves assist in identification. Description and ecology The sturdy trunk of the valley oak may exceed three meters (10 feet) in diameter and its stature may surpass 30 meters (100 feet) in height. The \\"Henley Oak\\", in Covelo, California, is the tallest known North American oak, at . The branches have an irregular, spreading and arching appearance that produce a profound leafless silhouette in the clear winter sky. During Autumn leaves turn a yellow to light orange color but become brown during mid to late fall. In advancing age the branches assume a drooping characteristic. Its pewter- colored rippled bark adds to the attractive aesthetic of this species. Close up of trunk fork and bark Typically, leaves are five to ten centimeters (2–4 inches) long and are roundly and deeply lobed. The leaf width is approximately one half its length. Each leaf is matte green with an underneath pale green appearance; moreover, the leaf is covered with abundant soft fuzz, yielding an almost velvety feeling. When a fresh leaf is rubbed or broken, an aromatic scent is exuded, evoking a forest odor. The wood is a dull brown approaching yellow, and it has not been used extensively for milling. Acorn and leaves Over most of the range, acorns fall in October. A variety of mammals and birds eat them, including the acorn woodpecker, California scrub jay, yellow-billed magpie, and California ground squirrel. The acorns are also attacked by bruchid beetles, but can survive moderate levels of infestation. Surviving acorns all germinate in their first winter, and none remain by mid-winter. The acorns are medium to dark brown and range from two to three centimeters (0.8–1.2 inches) in length. The caps have deep stippling and are found most often as singlets, but occasionally as doublets. The Concow tribe call the acorns lō-ē’ (Konkow language). Globular galls up to several centimeters in diameter are frequently attached to twigs of mature specimens of valley oak. These house the larval stage of small indigenous wasps Andricus quercuscalifornicus. A related wasp species, A. kingi, produces small galls shaped like Hershey's kisses on leaf surfaces. The valley oak is the only known food plant of Chionodes petalumensis caterpillars. Like many oaks, valley oaks can tolerate wild fires. Although smaller individuals may be top- killed, most resprout from the root crown. Distribution and habitat Valley oak tolerates cool wet winters and hot dry summers, but requires abundant water. It is most abundant in rich deep soils of valley floors below 600 meters (2000 feet) in elevation. Valley oak is found in dense riparian forests, open foothill woodlands and valley savannas. Commonly associated trees are coast live oak, interior live oak, blue oak, California black walnut, California sycamore and gray pine. The valley oak is widely distributed in: the California Central Valley; many smaller valleys such as the San Fernando Valley (original Spanish place-name from oak savannah), Conejo Valley, and Santa Ynez Valley; the Inner Coast Ranges south of the Eel River; and the Transverse Ranges from the Tehachapi Mountains to the Simi Hills, Santa Susana Mountains. It is also present on Santa Cruz Island and Catalina Island in the Pacific Ocean. Some of the most picturesque stands are found in Sonoma Valley, Round Valley in Mendocino County and the southern Salinas Valley near the up-river reaches of the Salinas River. Taxonomy Valley oak is of the white oak evolutionary lineage, which is officially known as the subgenus Lepidobalanus. This subgenus comprises numerous oaks from California and elsewhere, which species share similar leaves, acorns, bark and wood pulp. Early settlers used a variety of common names for the valley oak including: white oak, bottom oak, swamp oak, water oak and mush oak. The Spaniards, because the tree looked like the white oaks in Europe, called the tree \\"roble\\". Mature valley oak on a hillside Leaves of Quercus lobata Quercus lobata leaves with Spined Turbin Gall Wasp Historical accounts In 1792, the English explorer George Vancouver noted on his expedition through the Santa Clara Valley, after seeing an expanse of valley oaks: \\"For about twenty miles it could only be compared to a park which had originally been closely planted with the true old English oak; the underwood, that had probably attended its early growth, had the appearance of having been cleared away and left the stately lords of the forest in complete possession of the soil which was covered with luxuriant foliage.\\" In the year 1861, William Henry Brewer, the chief botanist for the first California Geological Survey wrote of the valley oaks that he saw in Monterey County: \\"First I passed through a wild canyon, then over hills covered with oats, with here and there trees—oaks and pines. Some of these oaks were noble ones indeed. How I wish one stood in our yard at home....I measured one [valley oak] with wide spreading and cragged branches, that was 26.5 feet in circumference. Another had a diameter of over six feet, and the branches spread over 75 feet each way. I lay beneath its shade a little while before going on.\\" The Hooker Oak of Chico, California, was once considered the largest known valley oak. When it fell on May 1, 1977, it was nearly a hundred feet tall (30 m) and 29 feet (8.8 m) in circumference eight feet (2.4 m) from the ground. Uses The acorns are sweet and edible; Native Americans roasted them and also ground the edible portion into meal to make into bread and mush. =Commercial wood interest= Difficulties in acquiring valley oak wood as well as issues stemming from its drying such as cracking and warping have shifted its consumption from a general purpose lumber to a primarily niche product. Valley oak wood has a small, but significant market for use in cabinetry though, and is also suitable for hardwood flooring. Tyloses present in the pores of valley oak wood increase its impermeability to fluids allowing it to be used in the production of water-tight vessels. Such vessels include wine barrels where valley oak wood sees limited role in the composition of and where it has similar properties to other white oaks such as a reduced tannin load compared to the red oaks and an open grain that allows for an increased transfer of oxygen.

Alexander Macleay (also spelt McLeay) MLC FLS FRS (24 June 1767 – 18 July 1848) was a leading member of the Linnean Society, a fellow of the Royal Society and member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. Life Macleay was born on Ross-shire, Scotland, eldest son of William Macleay, provost of Wick. Alexander had a classical education, before relocating to London and becoming a wine merchant with his business partner William Sharp - after whom his first son was named. In 1795 he was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society of London, also serving as its Secretary, and was also appointed chief clerk in the prisoners of war office. When the office was linked with the Transport Board after war broke out, Macleay became head of the correspondence department and by 1806 secretary. The Board was abolished in 1815, and Macleay retired on an annual pension, of £750. Macleay's chief natural history interest was entomology, principally lepidoptery, and he possessed the finest and most extensive collection then existing of any private individual in England and possibly the world. This included the British Collection of John Curtis now housed in Melbourne, Australia. In 1813, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. On 14 June 1825, Macleay was appointed Colonial Secretary for New South Wales. He arrived in Sydney in January 1826, with his wife Eliza, 9 of his 10 surviving children, and his extensive collection. He was soon working twelve-hour days and on 17 July 1825 was nominated to the New South Wales Legislative and Executive Councils, holding both positions until December 1836. Macleay represented Counties of Gloucester, Macquarie, and Stanley in the partially elected Legislative Council from June 1843 until 19 June 1848, a month before his death. Originally residing at the Colonial Secretary's House in Macquarie Place, Macleay was granted land at Elizabeth Bay by Governor Ralph Darling, where he constructed Elizabeth Bay House and laid out an extensive botanic garden. A memorial to Macleay on the wall of St James' Church, Sydney His extensive entomological collections formed the basis of the Macleay Museum at the University of Sydney. Macleay was also very active beyond his scientific pursuits and was the foundation president of the Australian Club. Family Macleay married a Miss Barclay of Urie. He was the father of the entomologist William Sharp Macleay, who expanded his father's collection, and of George Macleay, also a zoologist. William John Macleay, his nephew, was also an explorer and collector in Australia and New Guinea.

As of the 2006 census, Eudunda had a population of 640.https://quickstats.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/UCL421011?opendocument Eudunda is in the Regional Council of Goyder local government area, the South Australian House of Assembly electoral district of Stuart and the Australian House of Representatives Division of Grey.  Etymology and Nomenclature  The town name of Eudunda originates from the name of the spring to the west of the town, which local Aboriginals called judandakawi. According to Dr. Phillip Clarke of the South Australian Museum, judandakawi means 'sheltered water.' Alternative translations appear as Eudundacowi, Eudandakawi, or Eudundacowie. The spring still flows to this day. Some local theories suggest that German pronunciation of the letter j led to the current pronunciation. The earliest- known written mention of the name 'Eudunda' comes from the Adelaide newspaper, The Express and Telegraph, from 8 March 1872, where a small notice appears regarding the conveyance of mail. Weigall Street in Eudunda is named after Sir Archibald Weigall, Governor of South Australia, who visited Eudunda in December 1920 to lay the foundation stone of the hospital. Hannan Street is named in honour of John Hannan, who owned the land on which the town is now situated. History The earliest European activity in the district was overlanding, centred on Narcoota and the Narcoota Track in the late 1830s. Pastoralism soon followed, with expansive 'runs' being taken up for sheep grazing by men such as Lachlan McBean, Frederick Hansborough Dutton, and William Russell. Several decades then passed before closer settlement began. In the late 1860s, Henry Watson, a Quaker, established a wine store and bar on the site of the Eudunda Hotel Motel, serving passing stockmen. The founder of Eudunda was John Henry Hannan, who owned the land that was surveyed and divided for sale. In 1874, Friedrich Gotthilf Ernst Appelt opened Appelt's General Store on South Terrace, Eudunda. It was the first trading general store in the town. The building is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. Railway services were first introduced to Eudunda in 1878, with the opening of the North-West Bend Railway to Morgan. The line was opened by the Governor of South Australia, Sir William Francis Drummond Jervois, on the 18th of October, 1878. In 1878 the District Council of Neales was formed, with the town becoming the centre of the local government area. The District Council lasted until 1932 when it merged with the District Council of Julia to form the District Council of Eudunda. This lasted until 1997 when the Regional Council of Goyder was formed. In 1895, a meeting of farmers and other interested parties was held at Mann's Hotel (The Eudunda Hotel) to discuss the sale of firewood, predominantly from the Murray Flats around Sutherlands, Bower and Mount Mary, to Adelaide. This was the foundation of the state-wide store franchise, Eudunda Farmer's Co-Operative Society, which later formed Eudunda Farmers. Eudunda's strong German culture led to a series of events during the First World War that were stoked by anti-German sentiments. A local Lutheran pastor was arrested in early 1915 for having communicated with the then Attorney-General of South Australia, Hermann Homburg, regarding matters of naturalization. Although released shortly thereafter, a further incident occurred on February 12, 1915. Citizen's Forces raided homes and businesses of German-born and Australian-born residents. Sentries were posted outside the town stopping travellers in and out. Although the raiders discovered nothing, the raid was also served to demonstrate that authorities were determined to suppress any disloyal feelings. On the 16th of November, 1920, world-renowned author, Colin Thiele, was born at Mutter Knabe's Nursing Home in Eudunda. His upbringing in nearby Julia, and his two-year education in Eudunda, served as great inspiration for many of his writings. In 1950, Laucke Flour Mills acquired the prominent grain-mill building on Gunn Street, which had previously been owned by Edwin Davey.  Media  The Eudunda Courier and Murray Flats Advertiser was first printed in Eudunda on the 9th of February, 1922, by Mr. H. J. Weckert. Ownership changed in 1928 when F. T. Marsden bought the newspaper, and again in 1948 when N. W. and V. H. Baehnisch acquired it. In 1978, due to the death of V. H. Baehnisch, the newspaper closed, but after negotiation, the newspaper was taken over by the Reese and Smedley family. In 1981, the partnership changed hands, with Barossa News taking ownership. The Eudunda Courier then became a supplement to the Barossa Herald. Since then, the title has been dropped, with Eudunda news items now being covered by The Leader.  The town today  The town landscape has changed a little from the Edwardian era – with the \\"Gunn Street Extension\\" pushing the main road from the Top Pub on Gunn Street straight through what used to be railway land toward Bruce Street and the centre of the town. The new road has further enhanced the town gardens, seen on the drive into the main centre.Panorama of Eudunda from the town lookout, looking in a northerly direction, in February 2018. Eudunda was the birthplace of world-renowned author Colin Thiele, whose bronzed sculpture (by Chris Radford) is in the Centenary Gardens. The gardens also contain stone walls and tiled art featuring a Century of Transport. The town's distinctive German-Lutheran heritage continues with St. John's Lutheran Church and St. John's Lutheran Primary School. Many residents have German ancestry and carry Germanic surnames. Transport Laucke's Mill Building, Eudunda, located on Gunn Street. Eudunda was once a station on the Morgan railway line from 1878 until it closed. From 1914, it was the junction station for a branch running north past Point Pass to Robertstown. It is on the Thiele Highway, and is the junction to the Worlds End Highway leading north through Robertstown towards Burra and state route B84 (Curio Road) leading west through Auburn and Balaklava to Port Wakefield. Narcoota Narcoota and associated Narcoota Springs, lie in a valleyin the south of the Eudunda locality near Neales Flat. The area featured prominently in the pioneering history of South Australia. Located at Section 350, Hundred of Dutton, South Australia, , Narcoota Springs are at the eastern escarpment of the Mount Lofty Ranges, 12 kilometers south of Eudunda, in a valley on Narcoota Creek, adjacent to the later named Smith Road.Geographical Names in Australia, Gazetteer of Australia 2008, Geoscience Australia Narcoota, an indigenous name for the area, is of obscure meaning. It may be a corruption of ‘Narcoona’ – seeing – in reference to being a lookout over the Murray Plains.Australian Aboriginal Words, H.M. Cooper, SA Museum 1948 (1st ed.) European settlers adopted it from the outset, although it was variously spelt at first (examples are Nancoota, Tharcoota, and Nicota). Narcoota Springs was a bustling stopover and watering place for the earliest explorers and pioneering overlanders, being a rare source of permanent water at the brink of the waterless Murray Plains. It was at the western end of the Narcoota Track, which from 1838 to 1842 was part of the main (and first) road between the Murray River and Adelaide. At the eastern end was The Pound, 9 km north of Blanchetown, which years later became named McBean Pound at Roonka Station. The overland road diverged at the Pound – one track went south toward Mount Barker and the other west to Narcoota, then on to Gawler Town and Adelaide. Apart from overlanding parties droving large mobs of livestock from New South Wales, Narcoota Springs had some distinguished visitors in its heyday. They included Governor George Gawler and explorer Charles Sturt, as well as Henry Inman, Commander of Police, who passed through there at least five times.Inman: first commander of the SA Police / Max Slee (Seaview Press, 2010)Narcoota Creek, looking eastThe first was in 1839 when Inman led a police party to the Weston Flat district to investigate conflict resulting in the death of one over-lander and an unknown number of Aboriginals. Months later he was back again when he took part in the exploration expedition of Governor Gawler from North West Bend to Mount Bryan. In 1841 Inman was there again after his own over-landing party was attacked near Chowilla, losing 5,000 sheep. He again camped there as part of the 68-man police party led by Commissioner of Police Thomas Shuldham O'Halloran, sent by Governor George Grey to protect other over-landers at the Rufus River. After a settlement was established in late 1841 by Edward John Eyre at Moorundie (8 km below Blanchetown, South Australia), the overland route then shifted further south, roughly following the present Sturt Highway between Blanchetown and Truro. The Narcoota Track became disused thereafter.Hills, valley and plains: history of the Eudunda District / compiled by Betty Dreckow (Eudunda, 1986). Later in the 1840s a pastoral property named Narcoota Station was established. Nearby is Mount Rufus, where gold was discovered in 1868, but without much result. With closer settlement in the latter part of the 1800s, many grain farmers moved into the district, such that by 1900 there were busy schools and churches. Over a century later many stone ruins attest to the failure of close settlement, but those pioneering foundations produced the farms and grazing properties which thrive there today. Geologically, the beds outcropping along Narcoota Creek are so typical in structure and stratigraphy of geological features occurring in several locations throughout the North Mount Lofty Ranges, that the name Narcoota Series has been adopted for the entire group.

Some of the organizations were under the direction of the Confederate government, others operated independently with government approval, while still others were either completely independent of the government or operated with only its tacit acknowledgment. By 1864, the Confederate government was attempting to gain control over the various operations that had sprung up since the beginning of the war, but often with little success. Secret legislation was put before the Confederate Congress to create an official Special and Secret Bureau of the War Department. The legislation was not enacted until March 1865 and was never implemented; however, a number of groups and operations have historically been referred to as having been part of the Confederate Secret Service. In April 1865, most of the official papers of the Secret Service were burned by Confederate Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin just before the Confederate government evacuated Richmond, although a few pages of a financial ledger remain.Confederate States of America. Secret Service. \\"CSA Secret Service Account Book [Manuscript].\\" Chicago Historical Society. 1861–1865. http://www.chsmedia.org (accessed January 31, 2013). An account book of secret service expenditures with entries dated 1861–1874, plus a few apparently unrelated 1886 personal account entries by someone using the old volume. The volume has been mutilated extensively with only a few pages remaining. Thus, the full story of Confederate secret operations may never be known. Military operations and officially sanctioned Secret Service activities =Agents within the United States= The Confederacy benefited from the services of a number of \\"traditional\\" spies including Rose O'Neal Greenhow and Aaron Van Camp, who appear to have been members of an espionage ring during the formative period of the Confederate government. Greenhow was incarcerated at the Old Capitol Prison in Washington, D.C. Thomas Jordan recruited Greenhow and provided her with cypher code. Other known espionage agents include Belle Boyd and Catherine Virginia Baxley. John Surratt served as both a courier and spy. John H. Sothoron appears to have led the Confederate underground in St. Mary's County, Maryland. Col. Sothoron lived near Charlotte Hall Military Academy. His son, Webster, attended the school and was reputed to be a spy. Richard Thomas (Zarvona) and David Herold were also students, although Herold's attending is disputed. Samuel Mudd, of Charles County, Maryland, appears to have lent shelter to agents and harbored John Wilkes Booth, although Mudd's role is disputed. =Foreign Agents= The Confederacy's first secret-service agent may have been James D. Bulloch. In 1861, almost immediately after the attack on Fort Sumter, Bulloch traveled to Liverpool, England, to establish a base of operations. Britain was officially neutral in the conflict between North and South, but private and public sentiment favored the Confederacy. Britain was also willing to buy cotton that could be smuggled past the Union blockade, which provided the South with its only real source of hard currency. Bulloch established a relationship with the shipping firm of Fraser, Trenholm & Company to buy and sell Confederate cotton, using this currency to purchase arms and ammunition, uniforms, and other supplies for the war effort. Fraser, Trenholm & Co. became, in effect, the Confederacy's international bankers. Bulloch also arranged for the construction and secret purchase of the commerce raider CSS Alabama, as well as many of the blockade runners that acted as the Confederacy's commercial lifeline. Jacob Thompson was the Confederate commissioner in Canada. He distributed money, coordinated agents, and may have planned covert operations. He was involved in the attempt to liberate Confederate prisoners at Johnson's Island, a Union facility which also housed political prisoners. Thompson met with Clement Laird Vallandigham, an Ohio politician. Vallandigham, a potential presidential candidate against Lincoln, was arrested by Union General Ambrose Burnside and deported to the Confederacy. Vallandigham made his way to Canada. =Signal Corps= The Confederate Signal Corps was established in 1862. Nearly 1,200 men were in the secret service, most of whom were well-to-do and knew more than one language. Example: Alexander Campbell Rucker, brother of Col Edmund Winchester Rucker, was in the Confederate Secret Service. -from an article in the Owensboro Messenger (Owensboro, Kentucky) 16 Feb, 1922. Major William Norris was their commander. Norris may have worked under Braxton Bragg. On April 26, 1865, Norris took the position of the Commissioner of Prisoner Exchange Robert Ould. Ould may have been the civilian liaison to the corps, and Bragg the military liaison, with both reporting to Jefferson Davis or Judah Benjamin. Thomas Nelson Conrad was a scout and spy who worked with Norris. =Torpedo Bureau= The Torpedo Bureau, authorized on October 31, 1862, and headed by Brigadier General Gabriel Rains, was charged with the production of various explosive devices, including land mines, naval mines, and \\"coal torpedoes.\\" =Submarine Battery Service= Created at the same time as the Torpedo Bureau, the Submarine Battery Service was the Confederate Navy's torpedo specialists. The Service primarily utilized electrically-detonated torpedoes to protect the South's waterways. Originally under Commander Matthew Fontaine Maury, known as \\"The Pathfinder of the Seas\\", Maury was succeeded by his protégé\`, Lt. Hunter Davidson, when Maury was sent abroad to further his experiments involving electrical torpedoes and to procure needed supplies and ships. The Service operated along the James River between Richmond and Hampton Roads, Wilmington, NC, Charleston, SC and Savannah, GA among other locales. =Bureau of Special and Secret Service= In November 1864, the Confederate House of Representatives in secret session referred a bill “for the establishment of a Bureau of Special and Secret Service” to their Committee on Military Affairs. The bureau was to have a “polytechnic corps”. The existing “torpedo corps” was to be incorporated into the bureau. New inventions were to be encouraged.Confederate States of America. Congress. House of Representatives. \\"A Bill to Provide for the Establishment of a Bureau of Special and Secret Service.\\" Internet Archive. 11 31, 1864. https://archive.org/details/billtoprov00conf (accessed December 13, 2012). =Secret Service operations in Canada and the Maritime provinces= Confederate agents operated around Halifax, Quebec City, Niagara, Toronto, and (especially) Montreal. Sanctioned destructionists, privateers, and licensed operators =The bounty law= The Confederacy knew it was in trouble from the beginning of war without its own Navy. The few privately owned ships that could be converted to military service were no match for the Union Navy. On May 21, 1861, the Confederate Congress enacted an amendment to their May 6, 1861 Declaration of War which provided that > the government of the Confederate States will pay to the cruiser or cruisers > of any private armed vessel commissioned under said act, twenty per centum > on the value of each and every vessel of war belonging to the enemy, that > may be sunk or destroyed by such private armed vessel or vessels, the value > of the armament to be included in the estimate. In 1862, possibly following a suggestion, the Confederate Congress enacted a bounty of fifty percent of the value of any vessel destroyed by means of a new invention: > The Congress of the Confederate States of America do enact, That the first > section of the above entitled Act be so amended, that, in case any person or > persons shall invent or construct any new machine or engine, or contrive any > new method for destroying the armed vessels of the enemy, he or they shall > receive fifty per centum of the value of each and every such vessel that may > be sunk or destroyed, by means of such invention or contrivance, This attracted the attention of entrepreneurs. Horace Hunley put together a group of investors to finance the submarine that bears his name, hoping to profit from the bounties. Private individuals with engineering experience such as E. C. Singer, C. Williams, and Zere McDaniel developed and patented new torpedoes and fuses. =Special and detached service= =The coal torpedo= Developed by Thomas Courtenay of the Confederate Secret Service, coal torpedoes were hollow metal castings resembling a lump of coal. The castings were filled with powder and then secreted in the coal bunker of enemy vessels. When the coal replicas were shoveled into the fire boxes of ship's boilers, the resulting explosions either damaged or sank the ship. A hollowed out piece of wood filled with powder was used against river steamers. These could be concealed in the fuel piles of cord wood stacked along the river banks. =Active measures operations= While it is not known if the secret service was involved in the following, the likelihood is great. On 19 October 1864, the St. Albans Raid took place in Vermont by personnel in Canada. The attempted John Wilkes Booth plots in the assassination of President Lincoln in August 1864 and April 1865 may have been connected. This is argued in the Edward Steers, Jr. book, Blood on the Moon: The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln.

The school was founded as Garner Senior High School (GSHS), which graduated its first class in 1969. Garner is one of four high schools in the Wake County Public School System offering an International Baccalaureate Programme of study, along with Needham B. Broughton High School, William G. Enloe High School, and Millbrook High School. As of 2018-19, Garner offers its nearly 2,400 students 34 IB Diploma Programme courses, 16 Advanced Placement courses, 48 Career and Technical Education courses, Three world languages, a Public Safety Career Academy, an Army JROTC program, courses in Music, Dance, Theatre and Visual Arts, 19 varsity sports, and 50 student clubs. The school is also seeking authorization to begin offering the International Baccalaureate Career-related Programme beginning in the fall of 2019. History The school opened in the fall of 1968 when Garner desegregated its schools. Garner Consolidated School had served African-American students. Garner High School had served white students (and handful of African-American students who elected to attend under the \\"choice\\" plan that was in place prior to desegregation. Garner resident Tim Stevens, a retired journalist, in March 2018 premiered a theatrical production, \\"68,\\" telling the story of the school's September 2 opening that year. Stevens credits the community and principal Wayne Bare for managing integration peacefully and for overcoming a number of construction delays. In a 2008 book on implementation of the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision, editors Daugherity and Bolton attribute Garner's successful desegregation to Bare's effort to create a shared culture and avoid a power imbalance. In the summer of 2016, the Garner Magnet High School building was partially torn down due to mold and mildew, and Garner Magnet High School's students were located in the South Garner High School building until the renovation of Garner Magnet High School was complete.

N. mitchellii is a bipedal rodent with large back legs, similar to a jerboa or kangaroo rat. The species occurs throughout much of semi-arid Southern Australia, and appears to be particularly common on the Eyre Peninsula, South Australia. Typical habitat for N. mitchellii appears to be mallee shrublands on sandy dune systems. The species is currently considered to be unthreatened, but its range has been reduced through habitat disturbance and destruction associated with European settlement in Australia. Individuals are a sandy grey colour, with white chest hairs and a paler underbelly. The tail of the species is long and has the characteristic hopping mouse brush at the tip. This tail morphology is thought to aid balance when travelling at speed. Being nocturnal, Notomys mitchellii shelters during the day in typical hopping mouse burrows; a small number of interconnected, vertical shafts, burrowing deep into the dune. Up to eight animals, different ages and sex, have been found in a single burrow. N. mitchellii is known to have a lifespan of up to five years in the laboratory and this is thought to be a strategy evolved to combat the breeding- constraints of lengthy periods of drought. It has also been found that this species is less able to cope with water deprivation than other species of the genus. Notomys mitchellii produces concentrated urine to conserve water, but in a different way to more arid-dwelling rodents. The diet of N. mitchellii is also thought to consist of more roots and green matter than that of other species of the genus: animals captured in drought conditions had stomach contents consisting of some 85% roots, 11% green leaf and 4% seed. As a pet A 2010 report by the Australian Government Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation into the feasibility of keeping Australian native mammals as pets concluded that \\"Mitchell's hopping mouse is a suitable species for widespread keeping as a pet.\\" , this would require changes to legislation or policy in most Australian states and territories. As of late 2013, Mitchell's hopping mice can be kept as pets without a licence in Victoria (Australia), however commercial breeding still requires a licence to prevent removal of mice from the wild. Victorian Wildlife Regulations 2013 - Schedule 4B Species are commonly kept by large numbers of the general public. Husbandry techniques are simple and well established. A licence is required to obtain and, sell these species for commercial purposes as a safe guard against take from the wild.

The program was founded with 10 eight-grade girls to participate in engineering-based competitions. In the five-year period after the establishment of the program, the size of participant increased to 60 girls. The Board of Education of the Livingston Public Schools also supported the initiative by the mean of funding its technology lab. A review in 2013 by the American School Board Journal found that the program resulted in an improvement in standardized math test scores and more female students continued to enroll in higher-level math classes when they enter Livingston High School. However, the future career decisions for those participants are still yet to be seen. The journal awarded the program as one of the winners of the 2013 Magna Awards in the category of public school districts with 5,000 to 20,000 enrollments in the United States.

In addition to the many variants in service with the Swedish Navy under the \\"Stridsbåt 90H\\" designation, the CB 90 has been adopted by the navies of several countries, including Norway (as the S90N), Greece, Mexico (as the CB 90 HMN), the United States (as the Riverine Command Boat) and Malaysia. Additionally, the German Navy plans to equip the Berlin-class replenishment ships with the CB90. The CB90 is an exceptionally fast and agile boat that can execute extremely sharp turns at high speed, decelerate from top speed to a full stop in 2.5 boat lengths, and adjust both its pitch and roll angle while under way. Its light weight, shallow draught, and twin water jets allow it to operate at speeds of up to in shallow coastal waters. The water jets are partially ducted, which, along with underwater control surfaces similar to a submarine's diving planes, gives the CB90 its manoeuvrability.  History  Stridsbåt 90C In 1988, Dockstavarvet won a competition to design and manufacture a replacement for the aging Tpbs 200 class. Two prototypes, with pennant number 801 and 802, were delivered in 1989. After completion of field trials, the Swedish Navy signed a purchase order for 120 boats in June 1990. In 2002, the Swedish Navy ordered an additional 27 boats of a slightly different type, designated Stridsbåt 90 HS - where S refers to Skydd (protected) as the Strb 90 HS is armoured and features CBRN protection (the whole boat can be over-pressurized) - intended for use in international peace- keeping operations. Apart from the addition of armour, it sports air- conditioning for deployment in tropical conditions, fuel cooling system, 220 V generator and more powerful engines. The manufacturer sometimes refers to the model as the CB 90 HI, where the I probably stands for International. Several of the tasks carried out by the Strb 90 H-variants, were originally intended for the Strb 90 E, which is now almost completely phased out. The Royal Norwegian Navy evaluated the Strb 90 H in early 1996, and subsequently purchased a total of 20 boats, designated 90 N (for Norsk utgave, literally Norwegian version). The Mexican Navy acquired 40 units (designated CB 90 HMN) between 1999 and 2001, and obtained a production license in 2002, allowing further units to be manufactured in Mexico. Since then eight additional units have been built. The German Water Police rented a Combat Boat 90H from the manufacturer Dockstavarvet for the 33rd G8 summit in Heiligendamm, Germany. This boat was involved in a high-speed chase with three Greenpeace RIBs which were trying to enter the restricted area near the hotel where the meeting was being held. A video clip of the incident was later widely spread around the internet.SvD articleGreenpeace-Boote dringen in G-8-Sperrzone ein In July 2007 The United States Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) specified the CB90 for testing as its Riverine Command Boat. Safeboat International of Port Orchard, Washington, was given a US$2.8 million contract to produce one prototype. In June 2009 an unknown buyer from Abu Dhabi bought two civilian luxury versions.Di article In 2010, Dockstavarvet Shipyard modified two CB90's to be carried in the davits of Dutch and UK Navy Landing Platform Docks. During these six months trials, the two boats and a full Swedish boat squadron were embarked on a Royal Netherlands Navy LPD as a fully integrated element of the amphibious forces aboard and successfully deployed.

The L stands for ledning (command or leadership). * The Strb 90 KompL is a plain Strb 90 H in which portable computer and communications equipment has been installed, allowing it to temporarily provide company-level command and control. Electrical power is provided by a rather loud portable generator installed on deck. * The Strb 90 HS is designed for overseas peace-keeping and rescue operations. It is modified to keep its crew comfortable in Mediterranean conditions, with air conditioning, an auxiliary generator, a head, and more comfortable crew stations. More importantly, it is armored, and its engines have been upgraded to compensate for the added weight. * At least one Strb 90 H, pennant number 802, is equipped with a decompression chamber. * The Swedish Police operate one unarmed Strb 90 H equipped with bunks, a pantry and a crew lounge. * The Swedish Sea Rescue Society operates two unarmed Strb 90 Hs converted for search and rescue. * Hellenic Coast Guard operate also since 1998 three CB90 under the CB90HCG which is a slightly different version of the Norwegian Navy Version = Norwegian version= The Royal Norwegian Navy operates 20 CB90s under the designation SB90N; the N simply stands for Norsk utgave (Norwegian version). The S90N differs from the Strb 90 H in a few areas: * It is armed with two M2 Browning heavy machine gun (port and starboard), and a Sea PROTECTOR Remote controlled weapon station.https://www.tu.no/artikler/norske- stridsbater-blir-atte-knop-raskere-og-treffer-med-forste-skudd/232414 * The anchor winch is motorized, and the anchor is mounted at the stern, allowing a grounded S90N to tow itself afloat rather than risk damage to its impellers. * It carries an auxiliary generator which provides electrical power to navigation and communications systems even when the engines are not running. * The troop compartment has a higher deck height, making it possible for most people to stand without crouching. * It has two water tight compartments in the bow, having an extra room for toilet and stores. * It has a much more sophisticated navigation equipment based on GPS-technology delivered by Kongsberg Seatex AS. At least one S90N has been reconfigured into a floating ambulance.https://ambulanseforum.no/artikler/kriseplanen-for-luftambulanse- overgangen-forsvaret-har-ingen-ekstra-beredskap In 2004, the Royal Norwegian Navy conducted tests (including a live fire exercise) to evaluate the effectiveness of the SB90N as an aiming and launching platform for the Hellfire missile. One SB90N was equipped with stabilized Hellfire-launcher based on the Protector (RWS), and its machine gun was replaced with a gimbal- mounted sensor package containing visible-light and infrared cameras and a laser designator. Although the tests were successful, there is currently no indication that the Royal Norwegian Navy will actually deploy SB90Ns armed with Hellfire missiles in regular service. The Hellfire can still be carried on the boats without launching platforms and be fired from shore with the Portable Ground Launch System. The CB90s are used by the Coastal Ranger Commando.  Incidents and accidents involving CB90s  In mid-1999, one CB90 (No. 820) belonging to the Swedish Karlskrona Coastal Artillery Regiment (KA2) crashed into a concrete pier at approximately . There were eight soldiers on board; seven of them sustained more or less severe injuries, including fractures, while one soldier who was standing in the machine gun ring-mount on mid-deck remained physically unhurt. On June 13, 2004, several Strb 90 H from the Swedish First Marine Regiment (AMF1) were sailing at high speed in convoy formation when one of them abruptly reduced speed (allegedly so its wake would not upset a smaller sailboat). The boat immediately behind it failed to react and rammed it. Two soldiers who were above deck at the time of the accident were hit and thrown in the water; both were killed almost instantly. On the night of October 23, 2006, a CB90 sank off of Hamnudden, east of Utö in the Stockholm archipelago. The boat was traveling at due to the bad weather when it suddenly began to take on water from the bow. It then sank in less than ten minutes. All of the crew of 16 were quickly picked up by other ships that were nearby. No one was physically injured, but the crew suffered from shock and hypothermia when picked up. On October 5, 2014, a Royal Malaysian Navy CB90 bearing registration number CB204 was reported lost at sea due to storm and high tides. There were seven crewmen on board. The boat was last detected at 1.05pm some 57 nautical miles off Labuan Island. The boat was found on October 6 near Station Lima, after its distress call was heard by KD Paus, a Jerung- class gunboat, with no injuries to all 7 crew. It was reportedly caused by engine and steering problems. On January 12, 2016, two U.S. Navy riverine command boats were “taken into custody” by Iran's Revolutionary Guards' Navy near Farsi island in Persian Gulf. An Iranian state-run news outlet reported that 10 U.S. sailors had been “arrested” even though Iranian and U.S. officials said that none of the sailors were harmed and that they would be released promptly. Officials have stated that one of the boats broke down very close to Iranian territorial waters and after drifting for a short time both were picked up by Iranian forces. According to Stars and Stripes newspaper, the crews were released a short time later.http://www.stripes.com/news/middle- east/us-navy-sailors-held-by-iran-are-released-with-their-boats-1.388443  Operators  US Navy Riverine Squadron small unit riverine craft (left) and a Riverine Command Boat (right), 2011 ;: Hellenic Coast Guard: 3 ;: Malaysian Navy: 5 unit CB90, 12 unit CB90HEX ;: Mexican Navy: 48 ;: Royal Norwegian Navy: 20 ;: Royal Swedish Navy: 147 in service, 18 on order ;: Royal Navy: 4, formerly leased from the Royal Swedish Navy, used to evaluate the option of potential acquisition and returned to the Swedish Navy. ;: US Navy: 6, known as 'Riverine Command Boat' ;: Marina de Guerra del Perú: SIMA Peru will build, on behalf of the Peruvian Navy, in agreement with the N.Sundin Dockstavarvet factory, a subsidiary of the Swedish group SAAB, the first 2 ultra-fast combat boats out of a total of 24 that They will be used for maritime interdiction work on the Peruvian coast.

Career  =Club career= Despite being a native of Palermo, Tedesco was initially refused by the local team, Palermo, because of his thin build, and moved to Reggina. At Reggina, he quickly became a regular in 1990. After three seasons with Reggina (1 in Serie B, 2 in Serie C1), Tedesco moved to Fiorentina in 1993 and helped the team to win the Serie B league. The following season, he then debuted in Serie A in a 2–1 win against Cagliari on 4 September 1994. Successively, Tedesco has also played for Foggia, Salernitana and Perugia, where he stayed for six seasons and became popular as a valuable midfielder and team leader, especially during his time with Serse Cosmi as manager. In January 2004, Tedesco was signed by Genoa of Serie B in an attempt to strengthen the team for the end of the season, which was seeing the rossoblu fighting for the promotion to Serie A. However, Tedesco only settle in with the arrival of Serse Cosmi, his former coach at Perugia, for the following season, who replaced Luigi De Canio who had not been able to maintain the team into the top table positions. Genoa eventually won Serie B in 2005. However the club was denied promotion and instead relegated to Serie C1 due to alleged match frauds. After relegation to Serie C1, Tedesco chose to stay and played in Genoa for the first half of the 2005–06 season before accepting an offer from Palermo which he would not have ever refused. On 8 January 2006 Tedesco played his 500th professional match, a home debut match against Lazio, which the club won 3–1, and he scored the second goal. His contract with Palermo, due to expire in June 2007, was renewed for one more year after the final matchday. He was later stated to have refused offers from several other clubs in order to stay in Palermo and expecting to end his playing career with the rosanero. On 10 April 2008 he agreed terms with Palermo for another one-year extension of his contract with the rosanero. In 2008–09 he was featured even less, only playing 17 games in his season with the rosanero, many of them in the final part of season. In June 2009 the club announced to have agreed a two-year extension for the 37-year-old local hero and Palermo native, who will play with a rosanero jersey until June 2011. However, in the 2009–10 season he found limited opportunities in the first team, appearing only seven times during the club's Serie A season. In June 2010 it was confirmed Giovanni Tedesco's retirement from football, and his appointment as US Palermo's new team manager. =Coaching career= After a few months as team manager of Palermo, Tedesco was moved into the youth coaching staff, initially working alongside youth system chief Rosario Argento as his aide; later in September 2011 Tedesco took his first coaching job, as head of the under-17 Allievi Regionali team for Palermo. On 26 June 2012, Tedesco amicably parted company with Palermo in order to pursue a head coaching career. The next day he was announced as new coach of Lega Pro Seconda Divisione club Foligno, but he was sacked after four matches. On 6 April 2014, Tedesco was assigned as the new manager for Floriana FC. He then switched to another Maltese team, Birkirkara, also coaching former Palermo teammate Fabrizio Miccoli. On 25 January 2016, a few weeks after his departure from Birkirkara, Tedesco was announced as new head coach of his hometown club Palermo, as the club was searching for a trainer with the requested UEFA Pro coaching badges due to newly-appointed Guillermo Barros Schelotto's pending issues on that sense. On that sense, Tedesco will officially fill in the role of head coach and hold press conferences till the end of the season, with Schelotto working alongside him as a \\"team manager\\" till his bureaucratic issues will not get solved. On 10 February 2016, following Schelotto's resignation after UEFA refusal to hand him a valid European coaching authorization, Palermo announced to have promoted Primavera youth coach Giovanni Bosi as new head coach, with Tedesco as his technical collaborator. He successively left Palermo in order to return to Floriana as head coach on 15 June 2016. Further to 2017–18 Maltese FA Trophy defeat against Naxxar Lions F.C., Tedesco resigned with immediate effect from Head Coach of Floriana.https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20171203/football/tedesco- parts-ways-with-floriana.664802 At the end of May 2018, he was appointed as coach of Ħamrun Spartans F.C..https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20180531/football/hamrun- appoint-tedesco-as-coach.680530https://www.stadionews.it/giovanni-tedesco- tecnico-dellhamrun-ufficiale/https://www.tvm.com.mt/mt/sports/giovanni- tedesco-huwa-l-kowc-il-gdid-ta-hamrun- spartans/http://sport.repubblica.it/news/sport/calcio-hamrun-giovanni-tedesco- e-il-nuovo-allenatore/4741657 After reaching the fourth place in the league, he resigned from his position at the end of the season. Right after leaving, he signed a new three-years contract with Gżira United. On 18 July 2019, he surprisingly guided Gżira United to eliminate Croatian powerhouse Hajduk Split in the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League first qualifying round by defeating them at home 3–1. On 21 January 2020 Tedesco was sacked by the Maroons, leaving the team at the fourth position in the league. After just one month, in February 2020, he has been appointed as new manager of Valletta F.C., signing a deal until the end of the season.. After just three matches at the helm of the Citizens (due to the end of the season caused by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malta), in June Tedesco decided not to agree teerms with the club for another year, remaining without a team.

He was educated at both the College of Santa Fe (now Santa Fe University of Art and Design) in New Mexico and the Pratt Institute in New York. Since 1990, Paine's works have been exhibited in major collections and galleries across the United States, Germany, Sweden, England, the Netherlands, and Israel. His most reviewed exhibitions include Replicants, Machines, Dendroids, and Dioramas. Paine is represented by Paul Kasmin Gallery in New York The Kavi Gupta Gallery of Chicago & Berlin, and by the Marianne Boesky Gallery in New York. Roxy Paine currently lives and works in Brooklyn and Treadwell, New York.  Biography  Paine was born in New York City and raised in the suburbs of northern Virginia. Throughout his childhood, he spent his free time exploring the wooded, overgrown areas of land that separated housing developments in his neighborhood. He describes his experience of growing up in suburbia as a \\"twisted vision of nature\\", his environment possessing an \\"overwhelming blandness\\". Around age 13 or 14, Paine used his local creek as a place to experiment with using drugs and alcohol. > \\"There was a creek nearby when I was growing up. That's where I spent most > of my time. I would constantly reroute the stream, building dams. I was > mostly interested in the water. What I remember distinctly about nature in > the suburbs were the borders. The natural world is totally controlled and > manipulated in suburbia.\\" At age 15, Paine ran away to California to live with his brother, a hiker and rock climber. His brother's \\"outdoor western\\" influence spurred them to hike places like Yosemite and Joshua Tree. Living in California helped Paine make his decision to become an artist. He moved to New Mexico and enrolled at the College of Santa Fe, but he soon dropped out due to poor relations with his professors. > \\"In general, the teachers hated me. I always had problems with art teachers. > I don't know why. I didn't go in trying to be confrontational, but it always > ended up with bad blood somehow.\\" He then moved to New York and attended Pratt Institute for a time, originally as a painting major but later switching to sculpture. In addition to paintings, Paine produced unusual, functional ceramic and metal musical instruments. He eventually dropped out of Pratt, and with help from some of his colleagues, formed the artist collective Brand Name Damages in 1989. Work In his body of work, Paine mirrors natural processes, drawing increasingly on the tension between organic and man-made environments, between the human desire for order and nature's drive to reproduce. His highly detailed simulations of natural phenomena include an ambitious series of hand- wrought stainless steel trees, vitrines of mushroom and plant life in various states of decay and several large-scale machines designed to replicate creative processes. Many of his works create a platform to ask aesthetic questions about art, the natural, and the unnatural world rather than answer these questions like his counterparts he ignites the flame of inquiry. Collectively, his works demonstrate the human attempt to impose order on natural forces, depicting the struggle between the natural and the artificial, the rational and the instinctual. Paine has said, \\"I'm interested in taking entities that are organic and outside of the industrial realm, feeding them into an industrial system, and seeing what results from that force-feeding. The end results are a seamless containment of these opposites.\\"Tsien, Billie http://bombsite.com/issues/107/articles/3261 \\"Roxy Paine\\" BOMB Magazine Spring 2009, retrieved July 27, 2011 =Early work= Paine began showing his work in Williamsburg, Brooklyn in 1990 and 1991 at an artist run collective called Brand Name Damages (which he helped to found) and he had his first solo exhibition at the short-lived Herron Test-Site in October 1992. His early work consisted of kinetic and time-based sculptures such as Viscous Pult, 1990, which consisted of a paint brush smearing ketchup, white paint and motor oil on the gallery space's front window; and Displaced Sink, 1992, which had a leaking pipe in the ceiling dripping water on a tall stack of soap bars, leaving a pool of semi-liquid soap to collect on the gallery floor.Volk, Gregory. 'Roxy Paine: Dreams and Mathematics' in Roxy Paine: Second Nature, 2002. Page 27, Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston and Rose Art Museum, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA. Roxy Paine's Dinner of the Dictators, 1993-95. His next solo exhibition was at Ronald Feldman Gallery in 1995, and it included other kinetic works, but the central and most critically acclaimed work was a piece called Dinner of the Dictators, 1993–95, a vitrine enclosing the taxidermied favorite meals of infamous dictators, ranging from Genghis Khan and Adolf Hitler to Napoleon Bonaparte and Suharto. The research alone took eight months, and overall, the work took two years to produce, opening Paine to new approaches and processes in his work.Volk, Gregory. Page 28-29. From this point onward, Paine's work separated into a few distinct but nevertheless related categories. The first involves naturalistic works: minutely precise reproductions of natural objects like mushrooms, leafy plants or poppies. A second category consists of machine-based works: he has devised a number of conceptually-challenging art-making machines, like the SCUMAK (Auto Sculpture Maker), 1998, PMU (Painting Manufacturing Unit), 1999–2000, and the Erosion Machine, 2005. Bridging the gap between the naturalistic and mechanized works, Paine also creates large-scale stainless steel trees and boulders of varying sizes (ranging from 8 – 50 feet in height). =Replicants= Roxy Paine's Amanita Field, 2001, installed in Germany. Paine's vitrines and botanical works often feature replicas of plants that have been discovered as extremely poisonous or have been used by humans for experimental hallucinogenic or drug experiences. The living plants are cast and subsequently rendered in thermoset polymers, paint, lacquer, and epoxy, among other materials. Crop, 1997–98, shows a field of poppies, with ripened pods exposing the evidence of raw opium being readied for harvest. The piece embodies the shifting views of the beauty of a field of wild flowers and the grave potential of drug addiction.Volk, Gregory. Page 33. Amanita Muscaria Field, 2000, shows a field of psychoactive mushrooms that appear as if they are sprouting from the gallery floor. This field might present multiple readings: are these works a hallucinogenic vision on their own or do they represent the plant life that offers the possibility of arriving at that vision? Another related series of works is that of the Dead Amanita vitrines, lifelike mushrooms seem to be decaying under glass. The genus Amanita is a group of poisonous and psychoactive mushrooms that has some species that are among the deadliest if ingested by humans. Roxy Paine's Datura 2, 2006 Another example is the leafy plant genus Datura, which has long been used as a poison and hallucinogen; many species are known by common names such as Hell's Bells or Devil's weed. Paine's re-creation of various species of Datura take on a state of potential, presenting us with a deceptively simple plant that nonetheless contains complex molecules that can give rise to an altered state of consciousness. =Machines= Removing the artist's hand in the creative process and replacing it with a computer program is the crux of Paine's machine-based works. His first art-making machine, Paint Dipper, 1997, employed a steel armature that continuously dipped canvases into a vat of paint over the course of time, creating works that collect latex paint stalactites along the bottom edge. SCUMAK (Auto Sculpture Maker), 1998–2001, melts plastic with pigments and periodically extrudes them onto a conveyor belt, creating bulbous shaped sculptures that are each unique. Roxy Paine's SCUMAK 2, 2001, installed at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Detroit, 2007. PMU (Painting Manufacturing Unit), from 1999–2000, involves a metal painting arm that is programmed to expel white paint onto a canvas according to specific instructions programmed into the machine. The resulting works often can evoke landscapes or possibly layers of geological sediment. Most recently, Paine introduced his Erosion Machine, 2005, which consists of a robotic arm that traces and cuts patterns into large blocks of stone. The course of the arm's movement is determined by data sets, such as weather conditions and school test results. The work suggests the corrosive effects of human imposition on the environment while at the same time represents the transformation of the banal into the beautiful. About the SCUMAK (Auto Sculpture Maker), art historian Jonathan Fineburg wrote that \\"The beauty of the machine and the eccentricity of the results are also a paean to the romantic. Paine positions both his gardens and his machines at a fluid interface of man, nature, and science; they take the viewer to an intuitive experience of the liminal place at which scientists have arrived as they begin to redesign the human genome and connect living neurons with silicon chips.\\"Fineburg, Jonathan. Art Since 1940: Strategies of Being, Second Edition, 2000. Page 498-499, Harry N. Abrams, Publishers, New York, NY. =Dendroids= Paine uses both mechanical means and the innate logic of natural forms to create his \\"Dendroid\\" tree-like sculptures. Paine's meticulous research and observation of a variety of tree species help him to understand the \\"language\\" of how a tree grows, and from there he creates fictional tree species that grow to a logic of their own. Paine has said: > I've processed the idea of a tree and created a system for its form. I take > this organic majestic being and break it down into components and rules. The > branches are translated into pipe and rod.Roxy Paine, interviewed by Allan > McCollum. Bluff catalogue, 2002, Page 24. Public Art Fund and James Cohan > Gallery. Employing the language that he has invented pertaining to each of these fictive species, Paine's trees are \\"grown\\" through a laborious process of welding together the cylindrical piping and rods of diminishing size.Neil, Jonathan T.D. 'Do Androids Dream of Making Art? Roxy Paine's Robot Artworks and Artificial Environments Ask Just that Question' in Art Review, August 2006. He has also described his aims with the Dendroids series by saying, \\"I have been seeking to expand the edges of the language, and send the work outward into those edges. Essentially, I am establishing the rules of a language, only to then break those rules.\\"Tsien, Billie http://bombsite.com/issues/107/articles/3261 \\"Roxy Paine\\" BOMB Magazine Spring 2009, retrieved July 27, 2011 The first of these dendroids was Impostor, 1999, now at the Wanas Foundation, in Knislinge, Sweden. He has gone on to create 25 of these sculptures, including Bluff, 2002, which premiered in New York's Central Park during the Whitney Biennial in 2002, and the very ambitious Conjoined, 2007, recently on display in Manhattan's Madison Square Park (through December 31, 2007). Conjoined is a 40 ft tall by 45 ft wide sculpture of two trees whose branches cantilever in space and connect in mid air. Paine creates two different fictional tree species where each branch from one tree joins with a branch from the other. For the observer, it is unclear where one tree begins and the other ends. \\"Conjoined\\" was acquired in 2008 by and is on display at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. Paine's recent sculpture, Inversion, 2008, was installed in the Public Art Projects section of Art Basel 39, in Basel, Switzerland in June 2008. It was also part of FREEDOM: Den Haag Sculptuur 2008 in The Hague, Netherlands through August 2008. Maelstrom, 2009, was on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art from April 28 - November 29, 2009Metropolitan Museum website and Graft, 2009 was installed at the National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden in Washington, DC, in the fall of 2009. When asked about Maelstrom Paine described it as existing on five \\"levels\\" at once: > \\"On one level, it's a forest that has been downed by an unseen force—a force > of nature or, perhaps, a force of man. I also want the sculpture to be the > force itself, a swirling, churning force. The word 'maelstrom' actually has > a Dutch root; it literally means 'grinding stream,' ... The third state is > trees in the state of becoming abstractions. There are areas with > recognizable tree parts and then others where representation is stretching, > breaking apart, and coalescing again ... I want the fourth state of trance > to be a pipeline in a factory that's run amuck. This is getting back to the > root of the material, so to speak, which is purely industrial. Here the > piece is embracing its source. And, finally, the fifth state is that of a > mental storm, or what I envision happens during an epileptic seizure.\\" Distillation, 2010, was on view at James Cohan Gallery in New York from October 16 - December 11, 2010, and One Hundred Foot Line, 2010, was installed permanently at the National Gallery of Canada, in Ottawa, Ontario.National Gallery of Canada Distillation, as described by Hilarie Sheets in The New York Times, > pushes the metaphoric content that underpins these sculptures to new > extremes. It still uses arboreal forms, but they now mesh with other overtly > defined branching systems: a vascular network of arteries and veins with two > plump kidneys, mushroom colonies and their germinating mycelia, neuron > bundles and taxonomic diagrams, and raw pipelines connected to steel tanks > and industrial valves.Sheets, Hilarie. 'Man of Steel's Industrial Web > Mirroring Nature,' The New York Times, October 17, 2010. Ferment was permanently installed in April 2011 on the south lawn of The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, MO. Taking more than three years to produce, this 56-ft tall stainless steel dendroid sculpture, as described by Paine, \\"was trying to capture a churning, swirling force.\\" In June 2014, Symbiosis (2011) was installed in Philadelphia, PA in Iroquois Park, originally on temporary loan to the Association for Public Art courtesy of Paine and Marianne Boesky Gallery. In 2015, the Association for Public Art received a grant from the Daniel W. Dietrich II Trust, Inc. to acquire Symbiosis, enabling the dendroid to remain in Philadelphia. =Dioramas= In September 2013 Paine debuted the first two installations of a new series of work utilizing large-scale dioramas. The two installations were revealed in an exhibition at the Kavi Gupta gallery in Chicago. The new pieces, meticulously carved from wood, are life-size replicas of a fast-food restaurant and a control room, respectively. The new work draws from a complex dialog of Western and Eastern philosophies which both embrace and deconstruct the values and conceptual core of Paine's earlier work. Christian Viveros-Faune, in an interview with Paine, discussed Paine's interests in the Japanese philosophical aesthetic of Wabi-Sabi, which emphasizes the beauty within natural and unpredictable flaws.

His unorthodox style of electric guitar playing is widely acclaimed. Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin hailed Walker's guitar sound as \\"really strong\\". Peer Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine praised Walker's guitar playing, which he described as \\"this effortless playing producing a monstruous sound\\". Life and career When he was eight years old, Walker was deeply marked by the guitar's sound of the song \\"Sabre Dance\\" by Love Sculpture. \\"I used to go mad when it came on the radio.\\" When he was fourteen, Walker's family moved south from Newcastle to Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, 45 miles northwest of London. It was during this era that he acquired his nickname due to his northeastern \\"Geordie\\" accent (which he has subsequently lost). He decided to learn playing guitar: \\"I used to run home from school at about four, lock myself in the bedroom, turn the amp up full, and thrash it till he came in. It was a daily ritual\\". He learnt that it's melody lines as opposed to solos. The first guitar that helped him to find his way was bought in Northampton at Christmas 1973. When her mother saw a Gibson Les Paul in the shop, she suggested him to try it in souvenir of a concert she attended with Jimi Hendrix on the bill. After Walker played about two chords, her mother's verdict was; \\"we'll take it.\\" He worked at that time, \\"two real jobs\\" that allowed him to save money. He then bought another guitar, a Gibson SG Junior. Walker later moved to London to study architecture and became a founding member of Killing Joke in 1979 when he responded to an advertisement placed by the singer Jaz Coleman. He had never played in a band before. Walker and Coleman have been the only constant members of the group since. Walker has also been a member of industrial music supergroups Murder, Inc. and The Damage Manual. Walker now lives in Royal Oak, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit with his wife and son, Lloyd (Atticus). At the time of the recording of Hosannas from the Basements of Hell in 2006, he produced UK girl punk rock act Mary-Jane at Faust Studios in Prague. Influences Walker cited the band Love Sculpture and their sound on the song \\"Sabre Dance\\" because \\"it used the guitar as a musical instrument to convey an atmosphere, it wasn't normal guitar playing which people feel they have to play, certain rhythms, certain solos, certain scales\\". Walker also named Siouxsie and the Banshees' debut album The Scream as an influence because their original guitarist John McKay \\"came out with these chord structures that I found very refreshing\\". Style Walker's tuning of guitar is different. He likes it to be strung a whole tone lower. \\"It suits the resonance and the volume of the thing, and you can use heavier strings. I’ve got 58s on the bottom. Basically if I play an E-position chord, it’s D.\\" Walker said that \\"a guitar has a lot of musical capability, but it has the rhythm as well. As one instrument, I think it has the most pleasing sound, the attack, the rhythm\\". Concerning his guitar playing, Walker explained: \\"If you hit a chord and press down on the bridge, it bends all six notes at once, that's probably one of the odder aspects of my technique. If you want to get technical - things like augmented fourths and sevenths have a certain unnerving effect, a bit like a tingle up the spine. I go for a lot of those in my chord structures. Equipment His preferred guitar of choice is a hollow-bodied 1952 Gibson ES-295 in gold lacquer: an instrument also previously used by Elvis Presley sideman Scotty Moore. It is a semi-acoustic guitar, made in 1952, with a trapeze tailpiece. Walker bought it from an old jazzman who played in clubs. He plugged it into the Burman amplifier, \\"and the sound was there – a full resonance, and totally bell-like with the sustain on it through 250 watts of amplification in stereo. You can feel the thing vibrating, it's a huge sound. I tune the guitar in D (below bottom E) and my strings are really thick, I use an 062 on the bottom, and because of the way I tune the guitar, the strings still have the same response as a normal guitar would. The amplification makes the bottom end sound unreal. [...] the sound of the guitar is a lot sharper, a lot clearer than other ones I've heard.\\" He has used ADT units made by Bell, one of those on each amplifier : \\"It's got from a really tight delay to a single short delay, and a pitch bend on it\\", and Electro Harmonix Memory Man Chorus.

He is best known for his rendition of the Wilhelmus (the national anthem of the Netherlands), which he performed on countless occasions in football stadiums. Moreover, Van Dijk worked on various musical productions. In 1982, he represented the Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest. His song, \\"Jij en ik\\", written by Dick Bakker (music), Liselore Gerritsen (lyrics) and Peter Schön (musical arrangement), failed to make an impression in Harrogate: it finished 16th with only 8 points. He performed voices on Sesamstraat, the Dutch co-production of Sesame Street. Van Dijk did the voices of Roosevelt Franklin, Clementine, and many of the rock singers on the show (such as Little Chrissy and Bip Bipadotta). He was active on Sesamstraat until the early 1990s. Van Dijk portrayed the title character in both the Dutch and Broadway productions of Cyrano: The Musical in the early 1990s. He also played one of the lead roles in the Dutch production of the musical HAIR in the early 1970s, performing in Amsterdam at The Desmet Theatre and touring throughout the country. He also played Clopin in the Disney movie The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film) in the Dutch version.

Biography =Early life= Dundee was born the eldest son of a farmer, near Ballyclare, County Antrim, Northern Ireland. He was educated at Ballyclare High School, studied medicine at Queen's University Belfast, and undertook postgraduate studies at Liverpool, Oxford and Philadelphia. He graduated with a PhD from Liverpool University in 1957. =Career highlights= Dundee founded the Department of Anaesthetics at Queen's University Belfast in 1958. He was appointed Professor of Anaesthetics there in 1964—a post he held until his retirement in 1987. He worked as an anaesthetist in the Royal Victoria Hospital of Belfast, was a Fellow of the Faculty of Anaesthetists of the Royal College of Surgeons, and was Dean of the Faculty of Anaesthetists at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. He presented the Joseph Clover Lecture in 1988. A frequent international traveller, Dundee developed a great interest in acupuncture. One of his most notable achievements was the discovery that appropriate use of acupressure can provide relief of morning sickness in pregnant women. His 1988 report on this work, published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, demonstrates significant reduction of nausea and vomiting in a controlled trial. Dundee originated many anaesthetic techniques which remain in use, and his extensive writings on the subject continue to be consulted.235 articles are listed at He was a principal researcher of the human and veterinary anaesthetic ketamine and assisted in the development of intravenous anaesthesia. He also assisted with the development of cyclomorph, a preparation combining morphine and cyclizine. His \\"service to medicine in Northern Ireland\\" was acknowledged by the award of the Order of the British Empire in the 1989 New Year's Honours List. That year, he was also the first anaesthetist to be elected President of the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland. After his retirement, he was appointed Professor Emeritus and continued to undertake research into acupressure as an anti-emetic until his death, work which was sponsored by the Friends of Montgomery House, Belfast. Besides receiving international awards and accolades in medicine, Dundee also held an internationally prestigious musical qualification (Associate of Trinity College London (ATCL). As a medical student, he had been an organist at Raloo Church near Larne. He continued to play the instrument in later life at church services throughout Northern Ireland, and he also sang in the choir at Windsor Presbyterian Church, Belfast. At various times, he was superintendent of Windsor Mission and a member of the board of Belfast City Mission. From 1985 to 1987, he was President of the Christian Medical Fellowship of UK and Ireland.

Recent research has shown that not only are these two separate gems, but also that the story of once being owned by the Ruspoli family and having been acquired from a wooden spoon seller in Bengal are both apocryphal tales with no basis. The origins of this confusion stem from a book published in 1858 by Charles Barbot, who confused the Ruspoli Sapphire with the Grand Sapphire of Louis XIV.. The known history of this sapphire begins with a French jeweler named Perret, who sold it to a jeweler from Milan named Antonio Fusi around 1811. A dispute over the sale was settled by a court-ordered auction in 1813, leaving a clear paper trail of this gem's history. From there it passed through the hands of a well-known Parisian jeweler named David Achard who then apparently sold it to Henry Philip Hope (of the Hope Diamond fame). From there it passed into the Russian Crown Jewels and then to Queen Marie of Romania. Her daughter sold it to a \\"famed New York jeweler\\" in 1950, and its whereabouts from that point on are unknown.

She later served in the Soviet Navy as EK-2 and then in the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force as Shii (PF-17) and Shii (PF-297) and YAS-44. Construction and commissioning Long Beach was laid down 19 March 1943, as a patrol gunboat, PG-142, for the Maritime Commission by Consolidated Steel Corporation, in Wilmington, California. Reclassified as a patrol frigate, PF-34, on 15 April 1943, she was launched on 5 May 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Walter Boyd; and acquired by the Navy and commissioned on 8 September 1943, with Lieutenant Commander T. R. Midtlying, USCG, in command. Service history =U.S. Navy, World War II, 1943-1945= Following shakedown off California, Long Beach departed San Diego, on 12 January 1944 for Cairns, Australia, arriving there on 17 February 1944. After towing two LCSs from Milne Bay, New Guinea, to Cape Sudest, New Guinea, she departed on 16 March 1944 escorting the dock landing ship to the landings on Manus in the Admiralties. Returning to Cape Sudest on 18 March 1944, Long Beach screened ships around New Guinea, and on 19 April 1944 took part in the invasion of Aitape. She sailed for the Schoutens on 6 August 1944 for patrol and shore bombardment duty during cleanup operations against Japanese holdouts in the Biak area, returning to local operations off New Guinea on 31 August 1944. On 5 November 1944, Long Beach departed for newly invaded Leyte guarding a resupply convoy of tank landing ships (LSTs), arriving at Leyte Gulf on 15 November 1944 and returning to New Guinea on 21 November 1944. She steered for home 15 December 1944, calling at Panama and reaching Boston, on 25 January 1945. After overhaul, Long Beach, as flagship of Escort Division 25, departed Casco Bay, Maine, with the rest of the division - her sister ships , , , , and - on 28 March 1945 for Seattle via the Panama Canal, training en route at Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone. The six patrol frigates arrived at Seattle on 26 April 1945, then got underway again for Kodiak, Alaska on 7 June 1945. Ogden had to return to Seattle for repairs, but Long Beach and the other four frigates arrived at Womens Bay, Kodiak, on 11 June 1945.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp 24-25.

Training of Long Beachs new Soviet Navy crew soon began at Cold Bay.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 25. =Soviet Navy, 1945–1949= Long Beach was decommissioned on 12 July 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately along with nine of her sister ships, the first group of patrol frigates transferred to the Soviet Navy. Commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, she was designated as a storozhevoi korabl (\\"escort ship\\") and renamed EK-2 in Soviet service. On 15 July 1945, EK-2 departed Cold Bay in company with nine of her sister ships - EK-1 (ex-Charlottesville), EK-3 (ex-Belfast), EK-4 (ex-Machias), EK-5 (ex-San Pedro), EK-6 (ex-Glendale), EK-7 (ex-Sandusky), EK-8 (ex-Coronado), EK-9 (ex-Allentown), and EK-10 (ex-Ogden) - bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 27, 39. EK-2 entered service with the Soviet Pacific Ocean Fleet on 23 July 1945 at Petropavlovsk- Kamchatsky. She participated in the Soviet offensive against Japan in August–September 1945, including the amphibious landings at Chongjin on 18 August 1945 and at Maoka on 20 August 1945. After the Soviet Union concluded military operations against Japan on 5 September 1945, EK-2 served as a patrol vessel in the Soviet Far East. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations with the Soviet Union for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Navy for use during World War II. On 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned, EK-2 among them. Negotiations for the return of the ships was protracted,Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39. but the Soviet Union finally returned EK-2 to the United States at Yokosuka, Japan, in 1949. =Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, 1953–1967= Reverting to her former name, Long Beach lay idle at Yokosuka until the United States loaned her to Japan for service in the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) in November 1953 as . On 15 February 1957, the U.S. Navy cancelled the name Long Beach for her so that the name could be reassigned to a new ship, the nuclear-powered guided-missile cruiser , which was then under construction. On 1 September 1957, the JSMDF reclassified Shii as PF-297. Struck from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register on 1 December 1961, Shii was transferred to Japan outright on 28 August 1962 and saw continuous service in the JMSDF until decommissioned and renamed YAS-44 on 3 March 1967.

It is best known for producing, publishing, and distributing Sega consoles and video games in Brazil. The company was founded by Daniel Dazcal, Leo Kryss, and Abe Kryss in 1987 because Dazcal saw an opportunity to develop a market for electronic toys and video games, product categories that competitors did not sell in Brazil at the time. The company stock is traded on the Bovespa. Soon after its founding, Tectoy completed a licensing agreement with Sega allowing it to market a laser gun game based on the Japanese anime Zillion, which sold more units in Brazil than in Japan. Tectoy would later bring the Master System and Mega Drive to the region, as well as Sega's later video game consoles and the Sega Meganet service. Other products developed by Tectoy include educational toys such as the Pense Bem, karaoke machines, and original Master System and Mega Drive games released exclusively in Brazil, such as Férias Frustradas do Pica-Pau and Portuguese translations and alternate versions of video games. Over its history, Tectoy has diversified to include more electronic products, such as DVD and Blu-ray players and the Zeebo console. While successful at times, the company has also undergone debt restructuring in 2000 and actions to consolidate its two public stock offerings into one. Tectoy is credited with the continued success of Sega consoles in Brazil far past their lifetimes worldwide. At one point, Tectoy held an 80% market share of video games in Brazil. Tectoy continues to produce \\"plug and play\\" dedicated consoles modelled after the Master System and Genesis to this day, which continue to rival more modern systems by Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony in popularity. History = Formation and early years (1987–1996) = Tectoy was founded in September 1987 by Daniel Dazcal, Leo Kryss, and Abe Kryss. Dazcal was previously associated with Sharp Corporation in Brazil, while the Kryss brothers were the owners of Evadin, a Brazilian TV manufacturer associated with Mitsubishi. The new startup company sought to create \\"intelligent toys\\" designed specifically for the Brazilian market. At the time, Brazil's most dominant toy manufacturer was Estrela, which held 55% of the market share but did not have any interest in electronics. This gave Dazcal an area to focus the new company. In order to give the company an advantage in marketing costs, Tectoy set its factory in the Free Economic Zone of Manaus to leverage tax incentives. One of the primary goals of the founders of the company was to enter the video game market. Relying on individual previous experiences in working with Japanese companies, Tectoy executives reached out to Sega, which initially showed reluctance to partner with Tectoy given the failure of Tonka in merchandising Sega products in the United States. The company slowly built trust with Sega and was ultimately granted total liberty to manage Sega products in the Brazilian market. The first Sega product released by Tectoy was the Zillion infrared laser tag gun, based on the phaser featured in the anime of the same name. The success of Zillion led Sega to have Tectoy distribute its 8-bit video game console, the Master System, in Brazil as well. Launched officially in Brazil in September 1989, the Master System achieved success. Tectoy's revenue in 1989 was US$66 million, of which $40 million was attributed to the console. Some of this success is attributed to the company's strong advertising investments: the launch campaign, which lasted until Christmas 1989, was at an expense of $2 million. By the end of 1990, the Master System install base in Brazil was about 280,000 units. The company also introduced a telephone service with tips for games, created a Master System club, and presented the program Master Tips during commercial breaks of the television show Sessão Aventura of Rede Globo. Over a year after the launch of the Master System, Tectoy officially brought Sega's 16-bit console, the Mega Drive, to Brazil in December 1990. Sega's handheld console, Game Gear, was later released in August 1991. Like the Master System, the two products were assembled by Tectoy in Manaus, and Game Gear was the first portable console manufactured in Brazil. Sega's primary competition, Nintendo, did not officially arrive in Brazil until 1993; they entered the region through Playtronic, a partnership between Gradiente and Estrela. By the time Nintendo arrived in the region, they were unable to compete with pirated NES systems already available in the region and Tectoy's established following. Mega Drive surpassed the SNES in market share in Brazil, and Tectoy claimed 80% of the local video game market. By 1996, Tectoy had sold 2 million video game consoles and was receiving 50,000 calls a month to their video game tip line. On May 26, 1994, Dazcal died at the age of 42. He was replaced as CEO by Stefano Arnhold, who had worked for Dazcal at Sharp and became one of Tectoy's earliest employees in December 1987. Arnhold continued Tectoy's partnership with Sega and released the Sega Saturn on August 30, 1995, at a price of R$899.99. With the increase in the number of commercial Internet users in Brazil, Tectoy also invested in content and Internet access by introducing a Brazilian version of Internet service provider CompuServe, at the time the second largest US subscriber number. São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte were the first cities to receive the service. The service officially began in April 1997 and was part of a strategy to diversify the company's interests away from being a seasonal industry. = Debt restructuring and changes in focus (1997–2006) = In 1997, Tectoy saw financial losses of R$35.9 million and saw a 32% drop in revenue compared to 1996, a year in which the company also failed to meet its revenue goal. The company managed to reduce its losses in 1998, but still saw a net loss of R$10.8 million. During this period, the company launched the Dreamcast console in Brazil in September 1999 at a price of R$900. To cut costs, the Brazilian version was released without a pack-in game and a modem for Internet connection. The modem would be released months later at a price of R$49.99. As of July 2000, Dreamcast sold about 20,000 units in Brazil. By 2000, Tectoy had debts of R$55 million. The difficulties presented by the market caused Tectoy to announce its application for debt restructuring on December 9, 1997. At the time, the reasons disclosed to the press were the drop in sales and interest in Tectoy's products. The arrangement caused a number of Tectoy businesses to be restructured. CompuServe, which had opened the previous year in Brazil, was closed on April 25, 1998. Subscribers had the option of migrating to the competitor Universo Online (UOL). At the time of the closure, Arnhold stated that although the internet market was \\"promising\\", the company had not reached the number of subscribers that the company was expecting. As part of the debt restructuring, Tectoy renegotiated the debt up to six years for repayment, moved its factory in Manaus to smaller facilities, simplified its production chain, and cut its number of employees from 1000 to 110. In Tectoy's offices in São Paulo, all employees were centralized to one location. Tectoy also narrowed its focus to video games and its new work on karaoke machines. The company became the first in Brazil to use compact discs as media for its karaoke devices, in contrast to the cartridge-based machines of its only domestic competitor, Raf Electronics. With these restructuring changes, Tectoy was able to reduce its annual costs to R$4 million in 2001, half of what it spent in 1997, and bankruptcy procedures closed on October 4, 2000.left After the end of bankruptcy proceedings, Tectoy announced another change to its focus. The company announced its diversification from focusing solely on toys and video games into an \\"entertainment company\\". Tectoy intended to introduce more product lines, including DVD players, with a focus on higher profitability and less seasonality to the business. The company's video game business remained strong during this time; the year 2000 saw Tectoy make a 25% increase in sales of its Mega Drive console as compared to 1999. While a 2% sales decrease occurred in 2001 due to power rationing in Brazil, the company aimed for another 25% increase of its video game business the next year. By the year 2002, Tectoy had sold 1.2 million Mega Drives in Brazil, and aimed to produce another 100,000 units. Part of the continued success of the Mega Drive came from Tectoy's partnership with Brazilian television station SBT to release a game based on Show do Milhão, a popular game show. = Diversification and Zeebo (2006–2010) = Tectoy's third logo from 2007 to 2020. In May 2007, Fernando Fischer became the company's president. He promised to reverse the R$3 million loss from the previous year, and increase revenue by R$45 million. At the same time, the company began using the name \\"Tectoy\\" as one word instead of two, and introduced a new logo. Tectoy set forth four business areas of focus in the digital entertainment field: video games, DVDs, digital TV receivers, and toys. One of the first new products was a mobile TV digital receiver, MobTV, in December 2007. During the previous year, Tectoy entered the gaming market for mobile devices. Branded as a subsidiary called Tec Toy Mobile, the company partnered with Level Up! Games, responsible for games like the MMORPG Ragnarok Online. The partnership between the two companies ended in the second half of 2010, when Tectoy sold its stake in Level Up!. Tectoy also began importing the Nabaztag, a portable rabbit-shaped electronic device that played music and accessed information over Wi-Fi. A fire occurred in the Tectoy factory in Manaus in November 2008, which temporarily paralyzed the production lines of the company. In February 2009, Tectoy launched the first Blu-ray player manufactured in Brazil. Subsequently, neither the digital TV receiver nor the Blu-ray player have been financially successful. alt=Tectoy announced a partnership with Qualcomm in 2008 for a new project, the Zeebo. Known by the codename \\"Jeanie\\", the project was originally announced as a \\"digital toy\\" that would talk to \\"several existing technologies.\\" The new digital platform was publicly released at the end of the year as a new video game console dedicated to emerging markets, with no physical media and low price to minimize piracy. Zeebo was released in Brazil on May 25, 2009, but faced competition from Sony and its PlayStation 2 console, which originally sold at R$799. In turn, the Zeebo was not well received by consumers, selling only 30,000 units rather than the company's projection of 600,000. Fischer stated that Tectoy would be operating at a profit if it had not invested in and launched Zeebo. Faced with this scenario of losses, the Zeebo was discontinued in Brazil in 2011. The game purchase network, ZeeboNet, was shut down on September 30, 2011. = Further diversification and stock actions (2010–present) = For a short time starting in November 2010, Tectoy produced and marketed 14-inch tube TVs with 12 games included in memory. This production came at a time when LCD and plasma screen manufacturers accounted for 70% of production in the Free Economic Zone of Manaus. Faced with the success of outsourced set-top boxes for the South Korean company Humax, which produced them for Sky, Tectoy executives saw the possibility of using the company's factory in Manaus for third-party products. This, the company reasoned, would be especially helpful to those who wanted to enter the Brazilian market without investing in their own structure. Tectoy's workforce rose from 200 to 400 employees as a result of the partnership with Humax, which began on December 16, 2010. The company's partnership with Humax ended in the second quarter of 2013. In the wake of higher revenues obtained in early 2011, Tectoy attempted to auction preferred and common shares. While the company expected to gain R$9.6 million from the sale, a lack of market interest prevented the sale from happening. Tectoy continued to invest in new categories and licensing in digital electronics. Tablets were a major part of the company's revenue in 2013, accounting for 37% of revenue between January and September, with the expectation of surpassing DVD players and becoming their main product category. In 2012, Tectoy licensed Disney characters to launch a new product, the Magic Tablet. The company's shares were grouped in 2015. Tectoy was forced to carry out the procedure after actions of BM&F; Bovespa against penny stocks. A strategy of the company has been betting on nostalgia to bring back consoles that were sold in the 1980s and 1990s. In March 2017, Tectoy released the Atari Flashback 7, a version of the Atari 2600, with 101 games in memory but without support to insert game cartridges. Additionally, by June of the same year, it was planned to relaunch the Mega Drive, with some additional features such as a microSD card slot. As of the end of 2015, Tectoy was still selling plug and play Master System derivatives. By 2016, the company had sold 8 million of these systems in Brazil. Products Master System Super Compact, a Master System variant exclusively released by Tectoy in Brazil Tectoy is known for their handling and distribution of Sega consoles in Brazil. The company has sold all of Sega's consoles since 1987, including the Master System, Mega Drive, 32X, Sega CD, Game Gear, Saturn, Sega Pico, and Dreamcast, in addition to the Zillion laser tag gun. The company also introduced the Sega Meganet service to Brazil in 1995, starting with a focus on e-mail but later expanding to online multiplayer and chat by 1996, as well as partnering with Brazilian bank Bradesco to develop a banking system, similar to Japan's connection with Nagoya Bank. As of 2015, the Master System and Mega Drive combined sell around 150,000 a year. This is a level comparable to modern consoles available in Brazil such as the PlayStation 4, despite the Mega Drive being temporarily discontinued and reintroduced. Tectoy's hardware for the Master System and Mega Drive evolved over time into derivatives targeting the low-income market. These consoles generally do not have the cartridge slots, as games are installed directly on its internal memory. One of these consoles is the Mega Drive Portable, a portable Mega Drive with 20 games installed onto its memory. Other variations exclusive to Tectoy's releases include the Master System Super Compact, which is a wireless system that transmits to a television, and the Master System Girl, a version of the Super Compact in a neon pink case. In 2006, Tectoy released the Master System 3 Collection and the Mega Drive 3, including 120 and 71 built-in games, respectively. Tectoy has received and considered requests to remake the original Master System. Master System Girl, a pink-colored variant of the Master System Super Compact In the 1990s, Tectoy translated several games published by Sega into Portuguese. Translated games include the first three Phantasy Star games, Shining in the Darkness, and Riven, the last of which also incorporated dubbed voices. Additionally, Tectoy built relationships with other developers, including Capcom, Acclaim Entertainment, Electronic Arts, and Midway Games. Tectoy would then translate titles from these developers into Portuguese for release in Brazil, and to tie in to popular Brazilian entertainment franchises. Some examples of this include: Teddy Boy became Geraldinho, certain Wonder Boy titles became Monica's Gang games, and Ghost House became Chapolim vs. Dracula: Um Duelo Assutador, based on Mexican TV series El Chapulín Colorado. Additionally, Tectoy ported games for their Sega systems, such as Street Fighter II for the Master System and Duke Nukem 3D for the Mega Drive, as well as various games ported from the Game Gear to the more popular Master System. Aside from porting, the company developed Férias Frustradas do Pica-Pau after finding out that Woody Woodpecker was the most popular cartoon on Brazilian television. These titles were developed in-house by Tectoy in Brazil. Tectoy also suggested the development of Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II, a project that Sega accepted but would be the only suggestion from Tectoy that Sega approved. More recently, Tectoy created two Mega Drive games based on Show do Milhão, a Brazilian game show based on the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? format, and Mega Drive 4 Guitar Idol, a 16-bit rhythm video game based on Guitar Hero with its own guitar peripheral. Tectoy had been granted a master license by Sega for all of their games, including those developed in Europe or America, and had permission to sell any game by Sega in Brazil. Aside from its work with Sega, Tectoy has developed and sold karaoke machines, set-top boxes, televisions pre-installed with games, mobile games, DVD players, Blu-ray players, a mobile TV receiver, the Nabaztag music player, and the Zeebo video game console. Tectoy also distributed PC games in Brazil such as Blade Runner, StarCraft, and Daytona USA. A successful electronic toy of the company was the Pense Bem, a toy computer introduced in 1988 that asked questions to kids on geography and history. Another product, the Teddy Ruxpin, is a teddy bear that moves and tells stories, licensed by Tectoy for release in Brazil. The Magic Star, a plastic singing toy based on a character from Monica's Gang, was popular in the 1980s and later was rereleased in 2013. Other toys include the Mr. Show electronic question and answer game, as well as Sapo Xulé, a frog doll wearing sneakers, and toys developed for Senninha, a comic based on Ayrton Senna. More recently, Tectoy has also entered the infant care market, partnering with Fisher-Price on baby monitors and with Disney on air purifiers and toothbrush sterilizers.

Earlier meeting The agreement was reached after a mini-summit in Tripoli, Libya, hosted by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Prior to the meeting, Chadian Foreign Minister Ahmad Allam-Mi, Sudanese Foreign Minister Lam Akol, and Libyan Foreign Minister Abdel Rahman Shalgham, attended a two-day preparatory meeting aimed at reducing the scope of the disagreement before the heads of state met to iron out the details. Attendance Current Chairperson of the African Union and President of Congo Denis Sassou-Nguesso, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, Central African Republic President François Bozizé, African Union Chairperson of the Commission Alpha Oumar Konaré, and Burkinabé President Blaise Compaoré, the current chair of the Community of the Sahelo-Saharan States, also attended the summit. Sudanese Minister of Information and Communication al-Zahawi Ibrahim Malik called the summit \\"a generous initiative from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on patching up the rift and containing a security dispute between Sudan and Chad.\\" Resuming relations and ending support for rebels The two heads of state agreed to resuming relations and reopening consulates. The agreement calls for a ban on the use of territory of either country for hostile action and the acceptance of rebels from each other. Libya intends on overseeing the agreement to end hostile press campaigns and support of militant groups. However, Muammar Gaddafi has called on the leaders of each nation to continue talks on solving the root cause of tensions. \\"What's going on in Darfur is the cause of the tension in relations between Sudan and Chad... It is shameful that Africa resorts to weapons whenever there is a dispute. Unfortunately, we turn all our differences into wars, which gives an opportunity for foreign interference,\\" Gaddafi said. Gaddafi backs the Agreement to keep make sure the conflict stays \\"solely African.\\" The United Nations Security Council has contingency plans for international peacekeepers to replace African Union soldiers in Darfur. Gaddafi further stated that the nations involved in the dispute \\"have no need of UN peacekeepers - we have our own African forces - and we certainly have no need of the forces of our friend Prime Minister Tony Blair. We can settle our problems ourselves.\\" \\"The Tripoli peace agreement will enable the two countries to restore their good relations after they were about to go into the wrong path,\\" Déby said. \\"We will commit ourselves to the agreement because we are seriously endeavoring to exert sincere efforts which will be practically reflected in improving good neighborly relations,\\" al-Bashir said. Creation of new agencies In addition, the Tripoli Agreement creates a \\"ministerial committee,\\" chaired by Libya, to find a long term solution to the conflict, a commission to acquire information about the situation, and a peace force to prevent cross-border attacks by rebel groups like the UFDC and the Alliance of Revolutionary Forces of West Sudan. On February 12 Human Rights Watch expressed disapproval of the treaty's proposed multinational, instead of international peace force. The African ministerial committee, made up of the foreign ministers of Chad, Sudan, Libya, Central African Republic, Congo Brazzaville, and Burkina Faso and the chairman of the executive council of the Community of the Sahel-Saharan States (CEN-SAD), met in Tripoli on March 6 and Libyan Foreign Minister Abdel Rahman Shalgham described the results. African Union (AU) Commissioner for peace and security Said Djinnit delivered his report on the conflict and the committee agreed to set up surveillance groups on the Chadian-Sudanese border. The other groups proposed in the Tripoli Agreement are expected to be implemented after the committee’s next meeting, sometime before the end of March. The committee identified 10 positions along the border for surveillance, five on each side of the border, and the states expected to form the control groups and the mechanisms for their operation. Chalgam said the meeting was \\"constructive, sincere and detailed,\\" and said the results were \\"practical.\\" Reaction =Arab League= Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa said, \\"I have the honour to warmly congratulate [Gaddafi] for the historic achievement at the mini-African summit held under your auspices that culminated into the settlement of the recent problems that occurred between the two brotherly countries of Sudan and Chad as well the signing of a peace agreement to end the crisis that could be harmful not only to the two states, but the entire Africa and the African-Arab world. History and Arab and African peoples will cherish your efforts that contributed to the creation of a mechanism to transcend the differences between these two countries and will remember you as the Arab and African leader who has initiated Africa's unity through the creation of the [African Union] and the continuation of actions for the unification of the Arab and African worlds.\\" =Libya= Although it was not specified in the Tripoli Agreement, Gaddafi now wanted a temporary closure of the loosely enforced border between Sudan and Chad. Gaddafi said that \\"these measures are stated in the African Union deeds which are included in the AU constitutive act and the non aggression and joint defense act African security and Peace council protocol and the African joint defense policy plan.\\" Prior to the summit Libyan Foreign Minister Abdel Rahman Shalgham emphasized the \\"need for all sides to contain the tensions between Chad and Sudan.\\" After the summit Junior Libyan Foreign Minister Abdel Salam Triki expressed his belief that the summit between the leaders \\"was positive. We heard the points of view of both Sudanese and Chadian sides. They showed a willingness to find a mechanism to end the conflict. We feel confident about finding one.\\" =Mali= President of Mali Amadou Toumani Touré congratulated Libya's success with the Tripoli Agreement on February 15. =Niger= President of Niger Mamadou Tandja said Gaddafi has \\"once again proved [his] willingness to unite the African continent and reconcile its sons. I give my sincere congratulations for the success obtained by this summit. I reiterate my backing to whatever you do to unify the African continent and to consolidate the permanent march towards well-being and progress.\\" =Rebels= Mohammed Nour, the leader of the United Front for Democratic Change, the Chadian rebel alliance operating from bases in Darfur to attack cities in eastern Chad, was not invited to the summit, despite playing a crucial role in the tension between Chad and Sudan. UFDC rebels regard the treaty as \\"a piece of paper with signatures on it. It means nothing.\\" Nour's original demands, for Déby to relinquish power, a two-year interim period, and fair and free national elections, have been modified. Nour now wants a national forum, before the end of June, for opposition parties and organizations to discuss how the country should move forward politically. Nour said, \\"A delegation will arrive tomorrow in Libya to present our demands to [Libyan leader] Gaddafi. We will have a transitional period, the length of which the forum will decide, and then we will have free and transparent democratic elections. I guess after a week or more we will know what Déby's reaction to this proposal is. If he refuses, then we will attack using force to remove him... No one wants a war, but if that's the only way, we will go to Chad.\\" Another rebel group joined the UFDC on February 13, and Nour says the UFDC is \\"eight times stronger\\" than it was when it attacked the city of Adré on December 18. Colonel Bishara Moussa Farid acted as a peacekeeper in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, later helping both Déby and his predecessor Hissene Habre seize control of the Government of Chad. He recently defected, and said the UFDC is \\"much better off than the previous resistances. We didn't have equipment and heavy weapons as we do now.\\" =African Union= Congolese Foreign Minister and current chairman of the African Union executive council Rodolphe Adada said on behalf of the African Union, \\"We hope to move forward. We think we could again lay the foundations for a lasting peace. The two countries have for a long time remained in an atmosphere of absolute confidence and there is no reason that we can't rekindle that confidence.\\" =European Union= On February 14, 2006, the European Union expressed its approval of the treaty. Austria, which is the current president of the EU, released a press statement on February 13 on behalf of the EU, stating: > \\"After the tensions following the attack on the town of Adré by Chadian > rebels [the Rally for Democracy and Liberty and Platform for Change, Unity > and Democracy rebel groups] on 18 December 2005, the European Union sees > this agreement as an important step towards the restoration of a climate of > confidence and cooperation between the two countries. The European Union > appeals to both parties to honor this agreement, in particular their > commitment to refrain from hosting rebel forces of the other party on their > respective territory.\\" Severance of diplomatic relations Following the Battle of N'Djamena in April 2006, Chad severed relations with Sudan.

In an era where most Greek traders were anonymous, Herodotus believed that Colaeus and Sostratus the Aeginetan were important enough to note. Colaeus was on a venture to Egypt when he was blown off course by a great storm through the Mediterranean and into the Atlantic by the Strait of Gibraltar as far as Tartessus, south-western Spain. Tartessus had previously been unvisited by traders and Colaeus was able to obtain a cargo of metal and return it safely to Samos. Upon his return, he dedicated one tenth of his profits to his native goddess, Hera. It is widely believed that the storm was an invention by Colaeus to hide his trade route from his competitors as the rewards from the previously untapped source of metal proved immense. Phocaeans were the first visitors of Tartessos (Herodotus (Hdt. 1.163))Πρώτῃ δὲ Φωκαίη Ἰωνίης ἐπεχείρησε.

Studtite was originally described by Vaes in 1947Annales de la Société Géologique de Belgique - 1947 - pp B212 to B226- J.F. Vaes - Six nouveaux minéraux d'urane provenant de Shinkolobwe (Katanga) - from specimens from Shinkolobwe, Katanga Copper Crescent, Katanga (Shaba), Democratic Republic of Congo, and has since been reported from several other localities. The mineral was named for Franz Edward Studt, an English prospector and geologist who was working for the Belgians. When exposed to air studtite converts over a short time to the metastudtite UO4·2(H2O) form. Despite their apparent chemical simplicity, these two uranyl species are the only reported peroxide minerals. They may also be readily formed on the surface of nuclear waste under long-term storage and have been found on the surface of spent nuclear fuel stored at the Hanford, Washington nuclear site. It has also been reported that studtite has since formed on the corium lavas that were created during the course of the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident. Thus, there is considerable evidence that uranyl peroxides such as studtite and metastudtite will be important alteration phases of nuclear waste, possibly at the expense of other minerals, such as uranyl oxides and silicates, which have been more thoroughly studied and are better understood. The formation of these minerals may impact the long-term performance of deep geological repository sites such as Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. Due to insufficient information about these minerals it is unknown if they will make radioactive wastes more or less stable, but the presence of studtite and metastudtite provides a pathway for mobilizing insoluble U(IV) from the corroding fuel surface into soluble uranyl species.

Themes Davies' books often deal with the manipulation of human consciousness, and in some ways are comparable to the works of Philip K. Dick. (The premise of The Artificial Man resembles that of Dick's Time Out of Joint.) His protagonists frequently suffer from amnesia or other loss of identity, and their quest to find out who they really are drives the plot. Film adaptations Davies' novels The Artificial Man (1965) and Psychogeist (1966) were adapted into the 1968 film Project X, and The Alien (1968) was loosely adapted into the 1972 film The Groundstar Conspiracy.

The make-up effects were designed by Rick Baker. The film's scenario is at times comic or serious, and one of its peculiarities is that there never is any explanation for Ratboy's origin and existence as a human-rat hybrid. Ratboy had a troubled production and was both a critical and commercial failure. However, it received better reviews in European countries, especially France, winning the Deauville American Film Festival.  Synopsis  A failed window dresser named Nikki overhears of a mysterious \\"Ratboy\\" named Eugene while dumpster diving at a dump. After finding and befriending him, Nikki makes several attempts at exploiting his uniqueness to the public. At the same time, Eugene wishes to avoid public attention. In the end, the police are searching for Eugene's body, as Nikki stands saddened until a crystal in her jacket pocket begins to shine. Eugene had survived the gunshot and is hiding on top of a tree and signaling Nikki. Nikki is happy that Eugene is alive. Eugene then begins to flee as the police continue searching for him.

In commission in the US Navy from 1943 to 1945, and from 1950 to 1951, she also served in the Soviet Navy as EK-6 from 1945 to 1949 and in the Royal Thai Navy as Tachin (PF-1) from 1951 to 2000. Construction and commissioning Originally classified as a patrol gunboat, PG-144, Glendale was reclassified as a patrol frigate, PF-36, on 15 April 1943. She was launched on 28 May 1943, at the Consolidated Steel Corporation shipyard in Los Angeles, California, sponsored by Miss Shirley Schlichtman and commissioned on 1 October 1943, with Lieutenant Commander Harold J. Doebler, USCG, in command. Service history =World War II, 1944-1945= Following shakedown off Southern California, Glendale departed San Diego, California, on 12 January 1944 and reached Cairns, Australia, on 17 February 1944. Until late 1944, she served as an anti-submarine and anti- aircraft escort ship based in New Guinea, protecting arriving and departing merchant ships. In September 1944, Glendale took part in the assault on Morotai Island, departing Humboldt Bay, New Guinea, on 14 September 1944 to escort merchant ships to the island. She returned to Humboldt Bay on 24 September 1944 to continue escort assignments between New Guinea and the Philippine Islands. On 5 December 1944, Glendale was escorting a convoy from Hollandia to Leyte in the Philippines when attacking Japanese aircraft sank SS Antoine Saugrain, a cargo ship laden with valuable radar materiel, and severely damaged the merchant ship . Glendale brought the rest of the convoy safely into Leyte the next day. Glendale departed Leyte on 8 December 1944 bound for the Atlantic Ocean and moored at Boston, Massachusetts, on 24 January 1945. After overhaul, Glendale got underway from Casco Bay, Maine, on 28 March 1945 as part of Escort Division 25 - which also included her sister ships (the flagship), , , , and - bound for Seattle, Washington, via the Panama Canal. The six patrol frigates arrived at Seattle on 26 April 1945. They got underway again for Kodiak in the Territory of Alaska on 7 June 1945. Ogden had to return to Seattle for repairs, but Belfast and the other four frigates arrived at Womens Bay, Kodiak, on 11 June 1945.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp 24-25. On 13 June 1945, Glendale, Long Beach, Belfast, San Pedro, Coronado, and their sister ships , , , and got underway from Kodiak for Cold Bay, Alaska, where they arrived on 14 June 1945 to participate in Project Hula, a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan. Training of Glendales new Soviet Navy crew soon began at Cold Bay.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 25. =Soviet Navy, 1945–1949= Glendale was decommissioned on 12 July 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately along with nine of her sister ships. This was the first group of patrol frigates transferred to the Soviet Navy. When her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Ambrose Simko, handed Glendale over to the Soviet Navy, he as well as the commanding officers of the other nine transferred patrol frigates received custom daggers made for each of them as gifts from the Soviets. Commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, Glendale was designated as a storozhevoi korabl (\\"escort ship\\") and renamed EK-6 in Soviet service. On 15 July 1945, EK-6 departed Cold Bay in company with nine of her sister ships - EK-1 (ex-Charlottesville), EK-2 (ex-Long Beach), EK-3 (ex-Belfast), EK-4 (ex-Machias), EK-5 (ex-San Pedro), EK-7 (ex- Sandusky), EK-8 (ex-Coronado), EK-9 (ex-Allentown), and EK-10 (ex-Ogden) - bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union. EK-6 served as a patrol vessel in the Soviet Far East.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 27, 39. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations with the Soviet Union for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Navy for use during World War II. On 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned, EK-6 among them. Negotiations for the return of the ships was protracted, but on 16 November 1949 the Soviet Union finally returned EK-6 to the U.S. Navy at Yokosuka, Japan.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39. =Korean War, 1950–1951= Reverting to her old name. Glendale was recommissioned into the U.S. Navy on 11 October 1950 for service in the Korean War. In December 1950, the ship patrolled off Hungnam, Pusan, and Inchon, Korea, in support of United Nations forces fighting ashore. On 29 October 1951, she was decommissioned again and transferred along with her sister ship to the Government of Thailand. The U.S. Navy struck Glendale from the Navy List on 20 November 1951. =Royal Thai Navy, 1951-2000= The ship served in the Royal Thai Navy as HTMS Tachin (PF-1), later reclassified PF-411. She was decommissioned on 22 June 2000 at Sattahip Naval Base. Museum ship Dismantled and transported by truck to the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School in Nakhon Nayok Province, Thailand, Tachin was re-assembled and has been on display there since 9 July 2001 with all her original armament intact. Awards The U.S. Navy awarded Glendale five battle stars for her World War II service and four battle stars for her Korean War service. She also received the Korean Presidential Unit Citation for her actions during the Korean War.

Fogg was launched on 20 March 1943 by Bethlehem Steel Shipyard, Hingham, Massachusetts; sponsored by Mrs. Adelbert W. Fogg, mother of Lieutenant (junior grade) Fogg, and commissioned on 7 July 1943, Lieutenant Commander Charles F. Adams, Jr. USNR, in command. Service history Fogg's first cruise on convoy duty began with her departure from New York on 13 October 1943. She escorted unladen tankers to Aruba and Curaçao in the Netherlands West Indies, crossed to Algiers guarding loaded tankers, then returned by way of Curaçao and Trinidad to New York on 4 December 1943. Between 26 December 1943 and 20 August 1944, she made six escort voyages from New York to Londonderry Port, Northern Ireland, guarding the flow of men and material which made possible the invasion of Europe and the push across the continent which followed. The escort put to sea once more from New York on 12 September 1944, to escort a convoy through the English Channel to Cherbourg, France, then called at Portsmouth, England, before returning to New York on 9 October for a brief overhaul. After special training at Charleston, she sailed on 6 November to escort a slow towing convoy to England and back. Homeward bound, on 20 December, one of the LSTs in the convoy was torpedoed, and as Fogg began to search for the submarine, she, too, was torpedoed by commanded by Ernst Hechler. Fourteen of her men were killed and two wounded, and the ship badly damaged. For two days the crew fought to save their ship, but when on 22 December the stern sheared off, all but a skeleton crew were taken off. These men restored buoyancy, and Fogg reached the Azores in tow the next day. A first attempt to tow her back to the United States failed when bad weather tore away the temporary bulkheads replacing the stern, but she at last arrived at Boston for repairs on 9 March 1945. After refresher training, Fogg sailed out of Norfolk between 2 and 30 June 1945, acting as target ship in battle problems with a cruiser, serving as plane guard for a carrier, and training men in combat information center duty. On 1 July, she entered Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for conversion to a radar picket, which was completed on 2 October. Duty along the United States East Coast and in the Caribbean, primarily in anti-submarine warfare development and as combat information center school ship, continued until 26 July 1947, when she arrived at Charleston, South Carolina. There, Fogg was decommissioned and placed in reserve on 27 October 1947. She was reclassified DER-57 on 18 March 1949. On 28 October 1954 she was reclassified DE-57. Fogg was stricken from the Navy List on 1 April 1965 and sold for scrap on 6 January 1966.

More broadly, a post-war period (or postwar period) is the interval immediately following the end of a war. A post-war period can become an interwar period or interbellum, when a war between the same parties resumes at a later date (such as the period between World War I and World War II). By contrast, a post-war period marks the cessation of conflict entirely. Post- war =Chronology of the post–World War II era= The term \\"post-war\\" can have different meanings in different countries and refer to a period determined by local considerations based on the effect of the war there. In Britain, \\"post-war\\": *culturally, is a term commonly used in the arts and architecture, as it is worldwide. It is primarily and especially before the ascendancy of Pop Art and overlapping \\"post-modernist\\" \\"1960s\\" movements. Its end is complex due to its archetypes of the 1950s contrasting with leading developments in avant-garde music genres and in pop art, becoming to some audiences mainstream, before 1960. Its movements such as continued functionalism and brutalism were overtaken by the, definitively raucous, counterculture of the 1960s, dominating as the decade wore on. Later resurgences to its stress on quite basic forms were common such as postmodernism and minimalism. *politically and economically **at its broadest, is the period from the election of Clement Attlee in 1945 to that of Margaret Thatcher in 1979, the so-called post-war consensus. **at its narrowest, usually with precise or contextual qualifiers, it is the war's direct aftermath; this prompted social solidarity, unprecedented high capital, particularly inheritance taxation, internationalism, the granting of independence to the British Empire, the founding and endowing of the National Health Service all amid relative austerity particularly rationing. Hardships in capital taxation, and of rationing, faded due to global recovery, technological advances and consumerism enabled and encouraged from the late 1950s such as under the four-successive leader Conservative government, 1957–1964. These set a social norm for a majority of out-of-town journeys in private rather than public transport and private housing preferred over public housing, continued (with minor abatement) through alternating governments of the next two decades.The Post War Economy: 1945–1960 =Cold War era= Considering the post-war era as equivalent to the Cold War era, post-war sometimes includes the 1980s, putting the end at 26 December 1991, with the Dissolution of the Soviet Union. The 1990s and the 21st century are extremely rarely described as part of the post-war era.

Set in approximately of parkland, the house is a Grade II listed building. It has a 17th-century nucleus behind a classical two-storey front built of Ashlar stone. The gate piers either side of the carriageway leading to the house are also Grade II listed. The estate is documented from 1246. Throughout the 17th and most of the 18th centuries, the estate was owned by a succession of Bristol merchants and tradesmen, culminating in Robert Bush, a pewterer, who purchased the estate in 1774. His son, Robert, constructed a classical façade in c. 1800, obscuring much of the original building. Sold for more than £12,000 to General Sir William Gabriel Davy in 1820, it was much altered and rebuilt by his son, a prominent Freemason, who adorned the estate with many Masonic symbols. The estate again changed hands in 1926. The mansion ceased to be a private house in 1973, when it was auctioned and subsequently became a golf and country club and hotel. Early history During the Roman occupation of Britain, a large villa was sited on what is today the Tracy park estate. It was excavated in 1865, when it was found that the villa had once been enclosed by earthworks encompassing some two acres of land. Standing stones, thought to be the remains of a long barrow, just under a mile from the house, suggest that the site was occupied at an even earlier date. The present site became the property of John de Tracye in 1246; the park probably constituted 100 acres of land at the bottom of Freezing Hill and his manor house was likely near the church and not in the park, although its exact location is unknown. His descendants, Lords of the Manor of Doynton, held the property until the end of the 16th century. General Sir William Gabriel Davy who bought Tracy Park in 1820; his descendants owned the estate until 1926. The estate was purchased from John de Tracye's descendants in 1595 by William Wintor, who likely built the house a few years later. It was a small gabled building, known in the 17th century as Well House. By 1718, it had a hall and kitchen and, in the 18th century, sat in a park comprising 200 acres of land. The estate was owned by a succession of Bristol tradesmen, ending with Robert Bush, a successful Bristol pewterer, who purchased the house in 1774 for £6,250. Bush's son, Robert, inherited the estate. Most traces of the 17th-century house were obscured when he rebuilt it and gave it a classical façade in c. 1800. In 1820, Bush sold the estate to General Sir William Gabriel Davy (1780–1856) for £12,818, and it was his son, Rev. Charles Raikes Davy (1819-1885), who after inheriting the estate from his father in 1856, was responsible for the size and appearance of the house and estate seen today. Charles Raikes Davy began a program of rebuilding the mansion in 1858; datestones bear the years 1858, 1859, 1863, 1864 and 1871. He is thought to have commissioned the Bath architect John Elkington Gill to aggrandise the early 19th-century architecture. Gill retained the western façade, but embellished the slightly projecting central three bays with an overpowering Doric tetrastyle porch. It was during this rebuilding that two large pilasters were added to the western façade. In keeping with the mid-Victorian fashion for housing the growing number of servants in a separate wing, Gill also designed the large south-eastern service wing; this was designed in a loose Tudor Gothic style, linked to the main house by a belvedere. In addition to his work on the house, Davy was also responsible for building the dry-stone walls enclosing the property, and many of the estate buildings.  Description  The north-west entrance to the estate is through two tall mid-19th century gate piers, which are Grade II listed. These are constructed principally of rubble, but dressed with bath stone ashlar which frames heraldry peculiar to the Davy family. The piers are crowned by double cross finials. These piers clearly reflect the unusual design of the large buttresses on the south face of the mansion. Opposite the entrance piers, and deliberately complementing them, is a three-story farmhouse built in about 1845; this has been given heavy Grecian detailing, a blind pediment and a classical balustrade to its precincts. The southwest entrance is also through high gate piers, but these are cylindrical and of a simpler, chaste design than those of the northeast entrance. The mostly 19th- century rear facade; the finial of the belvedere tower can be seen above the roof-line. Tracy Park gives its name to the Grade II listed mansion situated within its grounds. The house has a 17th-century nucleus, but has been remodelled externally. Its two-storey western façade of seven bays, in a classical style built of limestone ashlar, dates from circa 1800. The slightly protruding central three bays contain the main entrance which is through a later Doric tetrastyle porch; the tympanum within the porch's pediment contains a lamb and flag motif, while the entablature bears the motto \\"In hoc signo vinces.\\" Two large pilasters sit between the outer pairs of windows on either side of the facade; perhaps intended to complement the porch, they rise only to the first floor and are crowned with heavy stone crosses. This porch is part of the remodeling of the house by Charles Raikes Davy. On the western facade's left side is a single-story 19th century extension; it has a central door (beneath a pediment) between two windows. Attached to the left is a lower extension, dating to c. 1920, with an arcade of eight Doric columns. A 19th- century belvedere tower to the right of the house's western elevation links the main building to the service wing. It is described by Verey and Brookes as containing \\"over-elaborate Grecian detail.\\" The unusual design of the tower is very much in the style of the 19th-century architect Alexander Thomson. Classical Greek architecture did not feature towers, therefore the tower would have been the unknown architect's own interpretation and explain why the \\"Grecian\\" tower contains both Greek and provincial Italian elements - such a tower is a feature of Italianate architecture derived from the look-out and campanile towers of the Italian Renaissance. Tracy Park's tower has an upper- most floor, completely surrounded by a slightly projecting Italiante balcony, supported by corbels, appears as a rectangular cupola and has Ionic pilasters at each corner; this structure is surmounted with a large finial. Much of the rear facade of the house was remodeled in the 19th century in a Tudor Gothic style. However, the haphazard fenestration suggesting mezzanine floors, and stonework and the need for a low buttress suggest that the lower floors, at least, may belong to the 16th and 17th-centuries. Facing the rear are a number of outbuildings, including the former stables, which date from 1849 to 1860. As of 2015, the Tracy Park estate consists of approximately of land. Historically, the size varied: when sold by the Bush family in 1820, to William Davy, the estate consisted of just ; nineteen years later, the estate was further reduced to , although it was expanded in the 19th century by Rev. Charles Raikes Davy.  Freemasonry  Temple of Solomon's pillars, a Masonic device. Tracy Park contains symbols of Freemasonry and the associated Knights Templar; these date to the occupation of the house by Rev. Charles Raikes Davy, who inherited the estate in 1856 and died in 1885. An Anglican priest, educated at Balliol College, Oxford,The Times (issue 31641). 28 December 1885. p. 4.The Times (issue 18438). 27 October 1843. p. 3. Davy was described in local newspaper reports as popular amongst Masonic groups in Gloucestershire due to his \\"devotion to the general interests of Masonry\\"; he was Grand Chaplain to the Grand Lodge of Freemasons and also Provincial Grand Master of Mark Masons for Gloucester. He added extensively to the estate in the 1850s, 1860s and early 1870s. Amongst these additions are symbols associated with freemasonry: the cross of Lorraine finials crowning the main entrance piers; the twin cylindrical gate piers at the south-west entrance bear resemblance to the twin pillars, Boaz and Jachin; and the deep engravings in an overmantel in what is now the hotel restaurant, described by English Heritage as \\"masonic emblems\\". Other Masonic references include the motto \\"In hoc signo vinces\\" carved above the mansion's principal entrance, taken from the standard of a Commander of the Knights Templar. On the south front are paneled twin buttresses, flanking the entrance and crowned with crosses, which seem to serve no structural purpose; they are possibly a further reference to the pillars of Boaz and Jachin. The lamb and flag motif carved into the pediment of the entrance porch is not only the crest of the Davy family, but also a symbol of the Knights Templar and Freemasonry.  Modern history  Charles Raikes Davy died in 1885 and his son, William (1851−1915), inherited the estate. The younger Davy moved to St Ann's in Burnham and, by 1897, Tracy Park was unoccupied. After his death, the estate passed to his son, William James Davy, who had lived in the United States and Ceylon before joining the Ceylon Rifles at the outbreak of World War I; he fought with them in Gallipoli and France, but was killed in action in 1916. After his death, the estate passed to his sister, Helen Hodges (later known as Mrs Arthington-Davy).Helen Arthington-Davy as Helen A Davy had married a Tom Hodges in 1919; she changed her name (along with that of her two sons, Tom Jeffrey and William Henry) by deed poll to Arthington-Davy in 1927. The Times (London, England), Thursday, 22 September 1927; p. 24; Issue 44693. In the family's absence, the house had been let from at least 1912 to Charles Samuel Clarke (1873−1947), a director of the Imperial Tobacco Company, who eventually bought the property from Helen Hodges in 1926. In July 1929, it was announced in The Times that the Davy heirlooms from Tracy Park were to be sold by Helen Arthington-Davy.The Times (London, England), Thursday, 4 July 1929; p. 29; Issue 45246. The Clark family remained in occupation of Tracy Park until the death of Charles Clark's widow, Elsie, in 1973; the estate was then put up for auction, after which it became a golf and country club hotel with two 18-hole courses, named the Crown and Cromwell. As a leisure complex, the estate was sold by Ian and Jane Knipe to TP Resorts in 2005; they bought it back in 2010 and, as of 2014, the Club is owned by Knipe and his wife, Ann.

Distribution This species is found in the tropical western Atlantic Ocean, including the Caribbean Sea. Human uses It has been proposed that Elysia subornata could be used as a biological control agent against an invasive strain of the alga Caulerpa taxifolia in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. The high toxicity levels of that alga discourage most of the native herbivorous fauna from consuming it. Elysia subornata, however, preferentially feeds on Caulerpa taxifolia, using the secondary metabolite, Caulerpenyne, for its own defence. It doesn't survive the cool temperature of winter Mediterranean waters, and would therefore need to be raised on a large scale to have any significant effect.

The second USS Gallup (PF-47), a in commission from 1944 to 1945 and from 1950 to 1951, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for Gallup, New Mexico. She also served in the Soviet Navy as EK-22 and in the Royal Thai Navy as HTMS Prasae (PF 2). Construction and commissioning Originally classified as a patrol gunboat, PG-155, Gallup was reclassified as a patrol frigate, PF-47, on 15 April 1943. She was launched on 17 September 1943 at the Consolidated Steel Corporation shipyard in Los Angeles, California, sponsored by Ensign Helen McMahon, NNRC, and commissioned on 29 February 1944, at San Pedro, California, with Lieutenant Commander Clayton M. Opp, USCG, in command. Service history =U.S. Navy, World War II, 1944-1945= Following conversion work at Newport Beach, California, and shakedown out of San Pedro and San Diego, California, Gallup departed San Diego on 1 June 1944 for the Pacific war zone. Conducting anti-submarine patrol en route, she arrived at Nouméa, New Caledonia, on 21 June 1944, and began escort and patrol duties in the waters of New Caledonia, New Guinea, and Australia with Escort Division 43. On 17 August 1944, she bombarded enemy strongholds to support landings on Biak Island at Blue Beach, north of the Wardo River by units of the United States Armys 41st Infantry Division; she continued to fire until the troops had completed their landing and secured the beach. Again, on 25 August 1944, Gallup lent support to the conquest of Biak by shelling the beaches between Menoerar and Cape Warari. After Biak had been secured, she returned to her duties with Escort Division 43 until 12 October 1944. Departing Hollandia, New Guinea, on 12 October 1944, Gallup was part of the screen for the task force which mounted the invasion of Leyte in the Philippine Islands. On 17 October 1944, she shelled the beach area of Dinagat, and the next day she swept the channel into Leyte Gulf as U.S. forces poised for the invasion. She then began anti-submarine and anti-mine patrol near Black Beach, screening vessels engaged in landing operations. Stationed most of the time off Desolation Point, she collected tide and hydrographic information, served as dispatch boat and as escort through the cleared channel in Leyte Gulf, guided incoming ships and convoys through the channel, and served as harbor entrance control vessel during landing operations. She performed these duties, most of the time in gusty, stormy weather, with her sister ship and the large infantry landing craft and , before being sent on an escort mission to Humboldt Bay, New Guinea, on 28 November 1944, touching San Pedro Bay in the Philippines, Kossol Roads in the Palau Islands, and Manus in the Admiralty Islands en route. On 3 December 1944, Gallup departed for the United States West Coast, stopping to drop men at Seeadler Harbor in the Admiralty Islands and at Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii. She arrived at San Francisco, California, on 25 December 1944. Departing San Francisco on 9 January 1945, Gallup steamed via Seattle, Washington, to Dutch Harbor, Territory of Alaska, where she arrived on 20 January 1945. She then patrolled the North Pacific Ocean. Selected for transfer to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula - a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy at Cold Bay, Alaska, in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan - Gallup proceeded to Cold Bay in August 1945 to begin training her new Soviet crew.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 39. =Soviet Navy, 1945–1949= Following the completion of training for her Soviet crew, Gallup was decommissioned on 26 August 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately along with her sister ships Bisbee, , , , and . Commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, Gallup was designated as a storozhevoi korabl (\\"escort ship\\") and renamed EK-22 in Soviet service. She soon departed Cold Bay bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union, where she arrived on 5 September 1945, too late to see World War II service with the Soviets. She served as a patrol vessel in the Soviet Far East.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 33, 39. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II. On 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned, EK-22 among them. Negotiations for the return of the ships were protracted, but on 14 November 1949 the Soviet Union finally returned EK-22 to the U.S. Navy at Yokosuka, Japan.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39. =U.S. Navy, Korean War, 1950–1951= Reverting to her original name, Gallup lay idle in the Pacific Reserve Fleet at Yokosuka until recommissioned on 18 October 1950 for service in the Korean War, with Lieutenant Commander William W. Boyd, Jr. in command. After shakedown off Sagami Wan, Japan, she got under way with Bisbee on 23 November 1950 for Hungnam, Korea. There she relieved her sister ship as harbor entrance control vessel, escorting ships when directed, guarding the channel against unfriendly ships, preventing friendly vessels from entering mined areas, and performing search and rescue services for the many refugees flooding through the area. On 19 December 1950, Gallup left for Pusan, where she performed anti-submarine patrol on the approaches to the harbor, before leaving on 31 December 1950 for Sasebo, Japan. On 29 January 1951, she returned to Korea, this time to Kansang and Kosong to participate in a feint intended to divert Communist forces by making them think an amphibious assault was imminent, conducting what was designed to look like a pre-assault bombardment against installations at Kansang and Kosong. Gallup continued to operate out of Sasebo, making escort, patrol, and guide tours to Pusan, Wonsan, and Chongjin, Korea, and to Sangley Point and Subic Bay on Luzon in the Philippine Islands. She helped in the bombardment of Wonsan from 23 through 25 February 1951 as United Nations forces seized the harbor islands, and then served as harbor entrance control vessel and \\"flycatcher,\\" in the latter role patrolling against enemy small boats, combat swimmers, and suicide attack craft. Returning to Yokosuka on 14 March 1951, she entered dry dock there for extensive hull repairs. Returning to Korea, she continued similar duty off the Korean coast until she returned to Yokosuka on 6 October 1951. =Royal Thai Navy, 1951-2000= Gallup was decommissioned and transferred under the Military Defense Assistance Program along with her sister ship to Thailand at Yokosuka on 29 October 1951, and served thereafter in the Royal Thai Navy as HTMS Prasae (PF 2). Prasae remained in service until struck from the Thai Navy Register and decommissioned on 22 June 2000. Museum ship Prasae initially was preserved as a memorial at the Sattahip Naval Base, then was towed to the mouth of the Prasae River in Rayong Province and put on display there by the Prasae River Communities Committee on 27 December 2003 as the \\"HTMS Prasae Memorial\\". Awards The U.S. Navy awarded Gallup two battle stars for her World War II service and three battle stars for her Korean War service.

Inside the gate, to the left, was the door from which Sykes exited his residence. The door to his 390x390px Sir Richard Adam Sykes, (8 May 1920 – 22 March 1979) was the British Ambassador to the Netherlands, who was assassinated by the IRA in The Hague in 1979. Early life Richard Sykes was born on 8 May 1920 to Brigadier A. C. Sykes. For his schooling he attended Wellington College before going up to the University of Oxford, where he attended Christ Church. Second World War During the Second World War, Sykes served in the British Army with the Royal Signals from 1940 to 1946. During his service he attained the rank of major. In 1945 he was awarded the Military Cross as well as the Croix de Guerre by France. Diplomatic career Sykes joined HM Foreign Service in 1947 and served at the Foreign Office from 1947 to 1948. He then served in Nanking (1948–50), Peking (1950–52) and returned to the UK to serve at the Foreign Office (1952–56). His next overseas postings took him to Brussels (1956–59), Santiago (1959–62) and Athens (1963–66), before returning to the Foreign Office (1967–69). Sykes' first posting as an ambassador came with a posting to Havana (1970–72) before moving to be a Minister at the British Embassy in Washington D.C. (1972–1975). From there he returned to the Foreign Office as Department Under-Secretary between 1975 and 1977. Sykes was then appointed as Ambassador to the Netherlands in 1977. Assassination Sykes was leaving his residence in The Hague at 9 am and was getting into his silver Rolls Royce limousine when he was shot. He was sitting next to Alyson Bailes. The car door was held by Karel Straub, a 19 year old Dutch national who worked at the embassy. Staub was also shot in the attack. Sykes' chauffeur, Jack Wilson, was uninjured and drove Sykes to Westeinde Hospital where he died two hours later. Straub was transported by ambulance to the same hospital where he also died. Police reported that the shots came from around 10 yards by two assailants wearing business suits who escaped on foot following the attack. Suspects for the assassination were Palestinians or Iraqis, although no evidence was ever put forward. It was ultimately confirmed that the IRA had carried out the killings.BBC coverage of Sykes/Straub assassinations, accessed 30 August 2014. The IRA claimed responsibility for the assassination in February 1980. In a statement they said of Sykes: \\"[he was] not just a Brit propagandist, as are all British ambassadors, but because he had been engaged in intelligence operations against our organisation.\\" The 'intelligence operations' mentioned in the statement related to a government report written by Sykes following the assassination of Christopher Ewart-Biggs. Ewart-Biggs was the British Ambassador to the Republic of Ireland and was killed by the IRA in 1976. Sykes produced diplomatic security guidelines as part of his report. Sykes' position as Ambassador to the Netherlands had been strained due to certain Dutch groups, which were sympathetic to the IRA, and consequent arms smuggling activities.The Guardian coverage of Sykes/Straub assassinations, theguardian.com, accessed 30 August 2014.Straub profile, cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 6 August 2014.Assassination details, cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 6 August 2014.Report on assassinations, time.com; accessed 6 August 2014.

The butterfly is named after Pierre Joseph Michel Lorquin, a French naturalist who came to California from France during the Gold Rush, and made important discoveries on the natural history of the terrain. Description The Lorquin's admiral has brown-black wings, each with a row of white spots across it. Its forewings have orange tips. Wingspan: 47 to 71 mm; females are generally larger than males. Distribution and habitat The Lorquin's admiral can mostly be found across the Upper Sonoran to the Canadian Zone, east to western Montana and Idaho. Known areas include southern British Columbia (including Vancouver Island, north of Emerald Lake), and Cypress Hills in southwestern Saskatchewan as well as southwestern Alberta. The butterfly resides mostly in forest edges, mountain canyons, parks, streamsides, fencerows, orchards, and groves of cottonwood and poplar. Usually the butterflies feed on California buckeye, yerba santa, privet, bird droppings, and dung. They are extremely territorial and will attack any intruders into their habitat, including large birds. Larvae Larvae are usually yellow with a patch of white on the back. Eggs are laid near or on the tips of leaves. Common trees that the larvae feed on include willow (Salix), poplar, cherry (Prunus), cottonwood (Populus), and an assortment of orchard trees, including cherry, apple, and plum. Flight season The Lorquin's admiral usually flies around April to October, though it depends on the region. Butterflies in northern areas tend to have one brood a year (usually between June and August) whereas southern butterflies (mainly in California) tend to have multiple broods.

History Historically part of Lancashire, the name Leece is probably from the Old English leah, which means 'woodland clearing', and the plural of which is Leas. It was recorded in the Domesday Book as Lies, in the Manor of Hougun held by Earl Tostig.Explore Low Furness It appears later in 1269 as Lees. Leece used to contain the United Methodist Free Church. It was founded in 1881, but closed in 1912. The building, which was taken down in the late 1920s, can still be seen on some photographs from the period. The church did not have a cemetery. St. Matthew's Church, in the village of Dendron, built in 1642, also served the village, as both a church and a school. It was funded by Robert Dickinson, a citizen of London, who had formerly lived in Leece. In the 1990s and 2000s, Leece played a part in the Lady in the Lake murder trial.

Geoff Edwards was originally to host the (unrecorded) pilot, but was dropped at the last minute and was replaced by producer Chuck Barris. Although ABC bought the series, they mandated that someone other than Barris be the host; Bob Barker, then hosting Truth or Consequences and also began hosting the Miss USA & Miss Universe Pageants on CBS that year, was selected without a screen test or pilot. The Family Game was played similar to Barris' more popular ABC game show The Newlywed Game, except that instead of four married couples there were three families (each consisting of two children and their parents). The series is notable for being the last new black-and-white network series to air in America prior to the nationwide switch to color in 1968. Gameplay The Family Game had parents and their children aged 6–11 years old trying to predict and match answers to a series of questions, similar to Newlywed. =Round 1= In Round 1, the younger children were asked three questions while their parents were off stage. The parents returned and the mothers responded to the same questions. Their teams scored 10 points for each answer they matched. =Round 2= In Round 2, the parents again left the stage and the older children answered four questions. The first three were worth 15 points, while the last was a \\"bonus\\" worth 25 points. When the parents returned, the father tried to match answers to the first three questions and both parents responded to the 25-point bonus question. The family with the most points won the game and a grand prize. If there was a tie, it was broken in the same manner as on The Newlywed Game. Before the show, each family was asked to predict how many points they would score. The one closest to their actual score without going over was declared the winner. Merchandise A board game based on the show was released by Hasbro at the time. Episode status The Family Game is believed to have been erased (\\"wiped\\") due to network practices. Only two episodes are known to exist. Attempted revival A revival was attempted in 1986 with Jeff MacGregor (the host of The All-New Dating Game from 1987 to 1989), but the pilot was not picked up. This unsold pilot can be viewed at the UCLA Film and Television Archive, and a clip was also shown briefly in the Game Show Network original series, As Seen On.

The virus later evolved into the eukaryotic nucleus by acquiring genes from the host genome and eventually usurping its role. The hypothesis was proposed by Philip Bell in 2001 and was further popularized with the discovery of large, complex DNA viruses (such as Mimivirus) that are capable of protein biosynthesis. Recent supporting evidence includes the discovery that, upon the infection of a bacterial cell, the giant bacteriophage 201Phi2-1 (of genus Phikzvirus) assembles a nucleus- like structure that segregates proteins according to function. This nucleus- like structure and its key properties have been found conserved in the related phages. The viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis has inflamed the longstanding debate over whether viruses are living organisms. Many biologists do not consider viruses to be alive, but the hypothesis posits that viruses are the originators of the DNA genetic mechanism shared by all eukaryotes alive today (and possibly that of prokaryotes as well). Critics of the theory point out that the similarities between DNA viruses and nuclei can be taken as evidence either of viral eukaryogensis or of its converse, nuclear viriogenesis: that complex eukaryotic DNA viruses could have originated from infectious nuclei.  Hypothesis  The viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis posits that eukaryotes are composed of three ancestral elements: a viral component that became the modern nucleus; a prokaryotic cell (an archaeon according to the eocyte hypothesis) which donated the cytoplasm and cell membrane of modern cells; and another prokaryotic cell (here bacterium) that, by endocytosis, became the modern mitochondrion or chloroplast. In 2006, researchers suggested that the transition from RNA to DNA genomes first occurred in the viral world. A DNA- based virus may have provided storage for an ancient host that had previously used RNA to store its genetic information (such host is called ribocell or ribocyte). Viruses may initially have adopted DNA as a way to resist RNA- degrading enzymes in the host cells. Hence, the contribution from such a new component may have been as significant as the contribution from chloroplasts or mitochondria. Following this hypothesis, archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes each obtained their DNA informational system from a different virus. In the original paper it was also an RNA cell at the origin of eukaryotes, but eventually more complex, featuring RNA processing. Although this is in contrast to nowadays more probable eocyte hypothesis, viruses seem to have contributed to the origin of all three domains of life ('out of virus hypothesis'). It has also been suggested that telomerase and telomeres, key aspects of eukaryotic cell replication, have viral origins. Further, the viral origins of the modern eukaryotic nucleus may have relied on multiple infections of archaeal cells carrying bacterial mitochondrial precursors with lysogenic viruses. The viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis depicts a model of eukaryotic evolution in which a virus, similar to a modern pox virus, evolved into a nucleus via gene acquisition from existing bacterial and archaeal species. The lysogenic virus then became the information storage center for the cell, while the cell retained its capacities for gene translation and general function despite the viral genome's entry. Similarly, the bacterial species involved in this eukaryogenesis retained its capacity to produce energy in the form of ATP while also passing much of its genetic information into this new virus-nucleus organelle. It is hypothesized that the modern cell cycle, whereby mitosis, meiosis, and sex occur in all eukaryotes, evolved because of the balances struck by viruses, which characteristically follow a pattern of tradeoff between infecting as many hosts as possible and killing an individual host through viral proliferation. Hypothetically, viral replication cycles may mirror those of plasmids and viral lysogens. However, this theory is controversial, and additional experimentation involving archaeal viruses is necessary, as they are probably the most evolutionarily similar to modern eukaryotic nuclei. The viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis points to the cell cycle of eukaryotes, particularly sex and meiosis, as evidence. Little is known about the origins of DNA or reproduction in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. It is thus possible that viruses were involved in the creation of Earth's first cells. The eukaryotic nucleus contains linear DNA with specialized end sequences, like that of viruses (and in contrast to bacterial genomes, which have a circular topology); it uses mRNA capping, and separates transcription from translation. Eukaryotic nuclei are also capable of cytoplasmic replication. Some large viruses have their own DNA-directed RNA polymerase. Transfers of \\"infectious\\" nuclei have been documented in many parasitic red algae. Another supporting evidence is that the m7G capping apparatus (involved in uncoupling of transcription from translation) is present in both Eukarya and Mimiviridae but not in Lokiarchaeota that are considered the nearest archaeal relatives of Eukarya according to the Eocyte hypothesis (also supported by the phylogenetic analysis of the m7G capping pathway).  Implications  A number of precepts in the theory are possible. For instance, a helical virus with a bilipid envelope bears a distinct resemblance to a highly simplified cellular nucleus (i.e., a DNA chromosome encapsulated within a lipid membrane). In theory, a large DNA virus could take control of a bacterial or archaeal cell. Instead of replicating and destroying the host cell, it would remain within the cell, thus overcoming the tradeoff dilemma typically faced by viruses. With the virus in control of the host cell's molecular machinery, it would effectively become a functional nucleus. Through the processes of mitosis and cytokinesis, the virus would thus recruit the entire cell as a symbiont—a new way to survive and proliferate.

It relates the free energy of a two-dimensional square-lattice Ising model at a low temperature to that of another Ising model at a high temperature. It was discovered by Hendrik Kramers and Gregory Wannier in 1941. With the aid of this duality Kramers and Wannier found the exact location of the critical point for the Ising model on the square lattice. Similar dualities establish relations between free energies of other statistical models. For instance, in 3 dimensions the Ising model is dual to an Ising gauge model. Intuitive idea The 2-dimensional Ising model exists on a lattice, which is a collection of squares in a chessboard pattern. With the finite lattice, the edges can be connected to form a torus. In theories of this kind, one constructs an involutive transform. For instance, Lars Onsager suggested that the Star-Triangle transformation could be used for the triangular lattice.Somendra M. Bhattacharjee, and Avinash Khare, Fifty Years of the Exact Solution of the Two-Dimensional Ising Model by Onsager (1995), Now the dual of the discrete torus is itself. Moreover, the dual of a highly disordered system (high temperature) is a well-ordered system (low temperature). This is because the Fourier transform takes a high bandwidth signal (more standard deviation) to a low one (less standard deviation). So one has essentially the same theory with an inverse temperature. When one raises the temperature in one theory, one lowers the temperature in the other. If there is only one phase transition, it will be at the point at which they cross, at which the temperature is equal. Because the 2D Ising model goes from a disordered state to an ordered state, there is a near one-to-one mapping between the disordered and ordered phases. The theory has been generalized, and is now blended with many other ideas. For instance, the square lattice is replaced by a circle,, Self-dual property of the Potts model in one dimension, F. Y.

This has resulted in the development of three task-specific \\"platoons\\" of players within any single team: the offense (the team with possession of the ball, which is trying to score), the defense (the team trying to prevent the other team from scoring, and to take the ball from them), and the so-called 'special team' (who play in all kicking situations). Within these three separate \\"platoons\\", various positions exist depending on the main task of each player.  Offense  In American football, the offense is the term used to describe the team that has possession of the ball and is advancing toward the opponent's end zone to score points. The eleven players of the offense can be separated into two main groups: the five offensive linemen, whose primary job is to block opponents and protect their quarterback, and the six backs and receivers, whose primary job is to move the ball down the field by either running with it or passing it. The organization of the offense is strictly mandated by the rules of the sport: there must be at least seven players on the line of scrimmage and no more than four players (known collectively as \\"backs\\") behind it. The only players eligible to handle the ball during a normal play are the backs and the two players on the end of the line (the \\"ends\\"). These players make up the \\"skill positions\\" and are also referred to as \\"eligible receivers\\" or \\"eligible ball carriers.\\" The remaining players (known as \\"interior linemen\\") are \\"ineligible\\" to catch forward passes. Within these strictures, however, creative coaches have developed a wide array of offensive formations to take advantage of different player skills and game situations. The following positions are standard in nearly every game, though different teams will use different arrangements of them, dependent on their individual game plans. = Offensive (interior) line = jerseys) consists of a center (with ball in hand ready to snap) with two guards on either side, and two tackles. The offensive line is primarily responsible for blocking the defensive line of the opposition, in order to protect their own quarterback. During normal play, offensive linemen do not handle the ball (aside from the snap from center), unless the ball is fumbled by a ball carrier, a pass is deflected, or a player who is normally an offensive lineman takes a different position on the field. The offensive line consists of:  Center (C)  :The center is the player who begins the play from scrimmage by snapping the ball to the quarterback. As the name suggests, the center usually plays in the middle of the offensive line, though some teams may employ an unbalanced line where the center is offset to one side. Like all offensive linemen, the center has the responsibility to block defensive players. The center often also has the responsibility to call out blocking assignments and make last second adjustments depending on the defensive alignment.  Offensive guard (OG)  :Two guards line up directly on either side of the center. Like all interior linemen, their function is to block on both running and passing plays. On some plays, rather than blocking straight ahead, a guard will \\"pull\\", whereby the guard comes out of their position in line to lead block for a ball carrier, on plays known as \\"traps\\" (for inside runs), \\"sweeps\\" (for outside runs), and \\"screens\\" (for passing plays). In such cases, the guard is referred to as a \\"pulling guard\\".  Offensive tackle (OT)  :Two tackles play outside of the guards. Their role is primarily to block on both running and passing plays. The area from one tackle to the other is an area of \\"close line play\\" in which blocks from behind, which are prohibited elsewhere on the field, are allowed. For a right-handed quarterback, the left tackle is charged with protecting the quarterback from being hit from behind (known as the \\"blind side\\"), and this is usually the most skilled player on the offensive line. Like a guard, the tackle may have to \\"pull\\", on a running play, when there is a tight end on their side. Tackles typically have a taller, longer build than interior offensive linemen, due to the need to keep separation from defensive linemen in pass blocking situations. They also tend to have quick footwork skills as they often engage against containing or rushing defensive ends. = Backs and receivers = Four backs line up behind the line of scrimmage. Additionally, there are two receivers, one on each end of the line of scrimmage, who line up outside of the interior linemen. There are four main positions in this set of players:  Quarterback (QB)  : The quarterback is the player who receives the ball from the center to start the play. Considered the most influential position on the offensive side because his team's progress down the field is dependent on his success, the quarterback is responsible for receiving the play from the coaches on the sideline and communicating the play to the other offensive players in the huddle. The quarterback may need to make late changes to the intended play at the line of scrimmage (known as an \\"audible\\") depending on the defensive alignment. At the start of the play, the quarterback may be lined up in one of three positions. If he is positioned directly behind and in contact with the center and receives the ball via the direct hand-to-hand pass, he is said to be \\"under center\\". Alternatively, if he is lined up some distance behind the center, he is said to be either in \\"shotgun formation\\" or in \\"pistol formation\\" ('shotgun' is generally further back than 'pistol'). Upon receiving the ball from the center, the quarterback has three basic options to advance the ball: he may run the ball himself, he may hand it to another eligible ball carrier to run with it, or he may execute a forward pass to a player further up the field.  Running back (HB/FB)  :Running backs are players who line up behind the offensive line in a position to receive a hand-off from the quarterback and execute a rushing play. Anywhere from one to three running backs may be utilized on a play (or none, which is referred to as an \\"empty backfield\\"). Depending on where they line up and what role they have, running backs come in several varieties. The \\"tailback,\\" also known as the \\"halfback,\\" is often a team's primary ball carrier on rushing plays. They may also catch passes, often acting as a \\"check-down\\" or \\"safety valve\\" when all other receivers on a pass play are covered. The \\"fullback\\" is often larger and stronger than the tailback and acts primarily as a blocker, though the fullback may also be used for catching passes or for rushing as a tailback does. Fullbacks often line up closer to the line of scrimmage than tailbacks do in order to block for them on rushing plays. A \\"wing-back\\" or a \\"slot-back\\" is a term for a running back who lines up behind the line of scrimmage outside the tackle or tight end on either side of the offensive line. Slot-backs are usually only found in certain offensive alignments, such as the flexbone formation. There also exists a similar position, known as the \\"H-back\\", that is actually considered a modification of the normal tight end position.  Wide receiver (WR)  A wide receiver (No. 87, in white) begins a play in the flanker position : Wide receivers are pass-catching specialists. Typically fast and tall, their main job is to run pass routes and get open (i.e. find a position with no near defender) for passes, although they are occasionally called on to block. Wide receivers generally line up split \\"wide\\" near the sidelines at the start of the play. Wide receivers, like running backs, come in different varieties depending on exactly where they line up. A wide receiver who is directly on the line of scrimmage is called a \\"split end\\" and is counted among the seven required players on the line of scrimmage. A wide receiver who lines up behind the line (and thus counts as one of the four backs) is called the \\"flanker\\". A wide receiver who lines up between the outermost wide receiver and the offensive line is said to be \\"in the slot\\" and is called the \\"slot receiver\\".  Tight end (TE)  :Tight ends play on either side of the offensive line and directly next to the tackles. Tight ends are considered \\"hybrid players\\" because they are a cross between a wide receiver and an offensive lineman. Because they play next to the other offensive linemen, they are very frequently called on to block, especially on running plays. However, because they are eligible receivers, they may also catch passes. The position known as the \\"H-back\\" is a tight end who lines up behind the line of scrimmage, and is thus counted as one of the four \\"backs\\", but their role is otherwise similar to that of other tight ends. Depending on the style of offense the coaches have designed, the game situation, and the relative skill sets of the players, teams may run formations which contain any number of running backs, wide receivers, and tight ends, so long as the mandated \\"four backs and seven on the line\\" rule is followed. For many years, the standard set consisted of the quarterback, two running backs (a tailback/halfback and a fullback), two wide receivers (a flanker and a split end) and a tight end. Modern teams show a wide variety of formations, from a \\"full house\\" formation with three running backs, two tight ends, and no wide receivers, to \\"spread\\" formations featuring four or five wide receivers and either one or no running backs.  Defense  The defensive team, simply known as the \\"defense,\\" is the team that begins a play from scrimmage without possession of the ball. The objective of the defensive team is to prevent the other team from scoring and win possession of the ball for their side. The defense accomplishes this by forcing the offense to turn the ball over by either preventing them from achieving a first down and forcing them to punt, forcing and recovering an offensive fumble, intercepting a pass, or, more rarely, forcing a turnover on downs. Unlike the offensive team, the rules of the sport do not restrict the defensive team into certain positions. A defensive player may line up anywhere on his side of the line of scrimmage and perform any legal action. Over time, however, defensive roles have become defined into three main sets of players that encompass several individual positions. = Defensive line = The four defensive linemen (in red) have their hands on the ground in a \\"three point stance\\" Like their offensive counterparts, defensive linemen (also called rushers) line up directly on the line of scrimmage. There are two positions usually considered part of the defensive line:  Defensive tackle (DT);  : Sometimes called a \\"defensive guard\\", defensive tackles play at the center of the defensive line. Their function is to rush the passer and stop running plays directed at the middle of the line of scrimmage. The most interior defensive tackle who sometimes lines up directly across from the ball and is, therefore, almost \\"nose-to-nose\\" with the offense's center is often called a \\"nose tackle\\" (alternately \\"nose guard\\" or \\"middle guard\\"). The nose tackle is most common in the 3-4 defense. Most defensive sets have one or two defensive tackles. If one employs a second defensive tackle, sometimes referred to as an \\"under tackle\\", they are usually a bit faster than the nose tackle.  Defensive end (DE)  :Defensive ends line up outside of the defensive tackles and are the \\"ends\\" of the defensive line. Their function is to attack the passer or stop offensive runs to the outer edges of the line of scrimmage, which is often referred to as \\"containment.\\" The faster of the two is usually placed on the right side of the defensive line (quarterback's left) because that is a right-handed quarterback's blind side. Defensive linemen will often take a stance with one or both of their hands on the ground before the ball is snapped. These are known as a \\"three-point stance\\" and \\"four-point stance\\" respectively, and this helps distinguish a defensive lineman from a linebacker, who begins in a two-point stance (i.e. without a hand touching the ground). = Linebackers = 4-3 set. Just behind the four defensive linemen (whose hands are on the ground) are three linebackers (Nos. 55, 3 and 16), and further back are two safeties (numbers 24 and 44). Linebackers play behind the defensive line and perform various duties depending on the situation, including rushing the passer, covering receivers, and defending against the run.  Middle linebacker (MLB)  :Sometimes called the \\"inside linebacker\\" (especially in a 3-4 defense), and known colloquially as the \\"Mike\\" linebacker, the middle linebacker is often known as the \\"quarterback of the defense\\", as they are frequently the primary defensive play callers and must react to a wide variety of situations. Middle linebackers must be capable of stopping running backs who make it past the defensive line, covering pass plays over the middle, and rushing the quarterback on blitz plays.  Outside linebacker (OLB)  : Outside linebackers are given different names depending on their role and the philosophy of the team. Some teams keep their outside linebackers on the same side of the field at all times while others define them as playing on either the \\"strongside\\" (SLB) or the \\"weakside\\" (WLB). The strongside, or \\"Sam\\", linebacker lines up on the same side as the offensive tight end and often is responsible for covering the tight end or running back on pass plays. The weakside, or \\"Will\\", linebacker lines up on the side of the offensive line without a tight end and is often used to rush, or blitz, the quarterback or to cover a running back on pass plays. = Defensive backs = Cornerback Tory James gets a read on the offense just prior to the start of play Defensive backs, also known as the \\"secondary\\", play either behind the linebackers or outside near the sidelines and are primarily used to defend against pass plays. They also act as the last line of defense on running plays and need to be able to make open field tackles, especially when the ball carrier has gotten past the other defenders. A normal defensive line-up includes two cornerbacks and two safeties, though specialty defensive backs (nickelbacks and dime backs) can be brought in in place of linebackers and defensive linemen when there is a need to cover additional receivers.  Cornerback (CB)  :Cornerbacks attempt to prevent successful passes by either swatting the airborne ball away from the receiver or by catching the pass themselves. In rushing situations, their job is to contain the runner, either by directing them back to the middle of the field to be tackled, by tackling them themselves, or by forcing them out of bounds.  Safety (S)  : The safeties are the last line of defense (furthest from the line of scrimmage) and usually help the corners with deep-pass coverage. The strong safety (SS) is usually the larger and stronger of the two, providing extra protection against run plays by standing closer to the line of scrimmage, usually on the strong (tight end) side of the field. The free safety (FS) is usually the smaller and faster of the two, and is usually the deepest player on the defense, providing help on long pass plays.  Nickelback and dimeback  :In certain formations, the defense may remove a linebacker or a defensive lineman to bring in extra pass coverage in the form of extra defensive backs. A formation with five defensive backs is often called a \\"nickel\\" formation, and the fifth (extra) defensive back is called a \\"nickelback\\" after the U.S. nickel coin, a five-cent piece. By extension, a formation with a sixth defensive back (dimeback) is called a \\"dime package\\" because it employs a second nickelback and the U.S. 10-cent dime coin is equal to two nickels (nickelbacks). Although it is a rare occurrence, a team may also use seven or eight defensive backs on a play, as well. Defensive formations are often known by a numerical code indicating the number of players at each position. The two most common formations are the 3–4 defense and the 4–3 defense, where the first number refers to the number of defensive linemen, and the second number refers to the number of linebackers (the number of defensive backs can be inferred, since there must be eleven players on the field). Thus, a 3–4 defense consists of three defensive linemen (usually a nose tackle and two defensive ends), four linebackers, and four defensive backs (two cornerbacks, a strong safety, and a free safety) Special teams A placekicker (Mason Crosby, No. 2) prepares to kick the ball from the hand of a holder (Jon Ryan, No. 9). Special teams are units that are on the field during kicking plays. While many players who appear on offensive or defensive squads also play similar roles on special teams (offensive linemen to block or defensive players to tackle), there are some specialist roles that are unique to the kicking game. = Kicking specialists = Kicking specialists are in charge of kicking the football. Depending on the type of specialist and the play that was called, the responsibilities of the these positions vary.  Kicker (K)  :Also called a \\"placekicker\\", kickers handle kickoffs, extra points, and field goals. All three situations require the kicker to kick the ball off the ground, either from the hands of a holder or off of a tee. Some teams employ two kickers: one kicks extra points and field goals, and the other, known as a \\"kickoff specialist\\", handles kickoffs. Most, however, use a single kicker for both jobs, and rarely, the same player may also punt.  Kickoff specialist (KOS)  :Kickoff specialists are exclusively used during kickoffs. Teams employ kickoff specialists if they feel neither their kicker nor punter is good enough at kicking off. Due to their specialized nature and the limited number of active roster spots, professional KOSs are rare.  Punter (P)  : The punter usually lines up 15 yards behind the line of scrimmage. However, this distance has to be shortened when it would result in being on or behind the end line. After receiving the snap, the punter drops the football and kicks, or \\"punts,\\" it from the air in order to relinquish possession to the defensive team and to send the ball as far downfield as possible. This is usually done only on fourth down. = Other special teams positions =  Holder (H)  : The holder is usually positioned 7–8 yards from the line of scrimmage and holds the ball for the placekicker to kick. The player occupying this position is often a backup quarterback or a punter because of their \\"good hands\\", feel for the ball, and experience taking snaps from a long snapper or center during plays from scrimmage. A holder is occasionally used on kickoffs if the weather or field conditions repeatedly cause the ball to fall off the tee.  Long snapper (LS)  : The long snapper is a specialized center who snaps the ball directly to the holder or punter. They are usually distinct from a regular center, as the ball often has to be snapped much farther back on kicking plays than on standard offensive plays.  Kick returner (KR) and punt returner (PR)  :Returners are responsible for catching kicked balls (either on kickoffs or punts) and running the ball back. These are usually among the fastest players on a team and typically play either wide receiver or cornerback, as well. However, due to the relatively high likelihood of injury during kick returns, most professional teams will not regularly use their very best WRs or CBs as returners. Teams may also use the same player for both return positions or have a specific returner for punts and another for kickoffs.  Upback  : The upback is a blocking back who lines up approximately 1–3 yards behind the line of scrimmage in punting situations. Because the punter plays so far back, the back frequently makes the line calls and lets the long snapper know when the punter is ready to receive the ball. Their primary role is to act as the last line of defense for the punter; however, upbacks occasionally receive the snap instead on fake punts and will either pass or run with the football in those situations.  Gunner  : A gunner is a player on kickoffs and punts who specializes in running down the field very quickly in an attempt to tackle the returner. They usually line up near the sidelines where there will be fewer blockers which allows them to get down the field quickly.  Jammer  :Jammers try to slow down gunners during punts or kickoffs so the returners have more time to move down the field.

The regiment served most of its time on the Atlantic coast in the Carolinas. The 3rd New Hampshire finished the war in North Carolina and were mustered out of Federal service on July 20, 1865, arriving back in Concord on the 28th for final discharge and payment.State of NH, Report of the Adjutant General, 1866: vol II pg505 The 3rd had a total of 198 casualties, with another 154 dying in Confederate prisons, disease, or warfare-related accidents. Military service After being mustered in, the 3rd New Hampshire left for Long Island, New York, encamping at Camp Winfield Scott at Hempstead Plains. From here, they went to Washington, D.C. and Annapolis, Maryland before arriving at Hilton Head, South Carolina, as part of the forces used to establish Federal footholds on the South's Atlantic Coast. Except for minor skirmishes with Confederate pickets, they did not see action until June 16, 1862, where it participated in the Battle of Secessionville. The 3rd entered battle with 26 officers and 597 men and suffered 104 casualties--27 of them killed or mortally wounded. In August 1862, the undersized Company H, consisting of 48 men, was stationed at the northern end of Pinckney Island. A Confederate raid overran this position, resulting in seven deaths and 36 prisoners of war, who were later exchanged. The 3rd New Hampshire then engaged in amphibious operations for several months and was assigned to one of the brigades to attack Fort Wagner. From July 10-13, 1863, the 3rd attempted the first assault, which failed, losing seven killed and 21 wounded. The regiment lost another eight in a second failed assault which took place July 18, 1863. During the spring of 1864, the 3rd New Hampshire was transferred north to Virginia where they joined the 10th Corps, also known as the Army of the James. Soon after, they were heavily engaged at Drewry's Bluff on May 16, 1864, where sixty-six New Hampshire men were killed or wounded. On August 16, 1864, they also fought at Deep Bottom, Virginia, where Lt. Colonel Josiah Plimpton, in command of the regiment, was mortally wounded.

He graduated from Randolph-Macon College in Virginia (A.B. degree, 1844). Career Already licensed to preach, McTyeire was admitted on trial into the Virginia Annual Conference in November 1845. He was appointed to Williamsburg, Virginia. After one year's service, he was transferred to the Alabama Conference, admitted into full connection at the first of 1848. He was a pastor in Alabama (Mobile and Demopolis) and Mississippi (Columbus), before transferring to the Louisiana Conference, where he was ordained elder in 1849. He also was a pastor in New Orleans. In 1854, McTyeire was elected editor of the New Orleans Christian Advocate, serving in this position until 1858. He was then elected editor of the Nashville Christian Advocate, the central organ of the M.E. Church, South. Interrupted in his editorial career by the American Civil War of 1861-1865, he entered the pastorate again in the Alabama Conference, serving in the city of Montgomery, from which he was elected to the episcopacy in 1866 at the General Conference meeting that year in New Orleans. McTyeire led a movement within the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, to establish \\"an institution of learning of the highest order.\\" In 1872, a charter for a \\"Central University\\" was issued to the bishop and fellow petitioners, who represented the nine M.E.

Biography Born in Kent, England in 1802, William Locke Brockman was a member of the Brockman family, a prominent Kent family with a history dating back to the 14th century. Little is known of his early life, except that he was a farmer with land in the Romney Marsh area. In 1827, Brockman married Ann Francis Elizabeth Hamersley (1809–1876). They would have six sons and three daughters. In 1829, Brockman, with his wife and eldest son Edmund, emigrated to the Swan River Colony in Western Australia. They arrived on the in January 1830. Brockman brought with him a prefabricated house, seven servants, and a number of sheep. Under the colony's system of land grants, this entitled him to a grant of over . He was only the ninth person to be granted land in the colony. He established himself as a pastoralist and wheat grower in the Upper Swan district. He named his grant Herne Hill, and this name survives today as the name of the Perth suburb of Herne Hill. He was a foundation member of the Swan Agricultural Society in 1831, and in 1833 became a Justice of the Peace. In 1837, he constructed a mill on his property. His success as a farmer prompted his wife's brother Edward Hamersley to immigrate. Hamersley arrived with his wife and son Edward in February 1837. He ultimately became a successful and wealthy pastoralist, and a member of the Western Australian Legislative Council, and the Hamersley family became one of the most prominent families in the colony. In 1839, he was nominated to the Western Australian Legislative Council, but he resigned the following year. From around 1845, he began exporting horses to India. He later acquired land near Northam, and was the first person to take up land in what is now the Shire of Bindoon. For this reason, the Brockman River, which flows through the Bindoon Shire, was named after him. Local aborigines showed him the land around Gingin and because it had permanent water, he took up land there in 1841. He called the property Cheriton, after the parish of his father, the Reverend Julius Drake-Brockman. A water powered mill was built over the Gingin Brook by Alfred Carson and wheat was milled into flour, helping relieve the West Australian colony's dependence on imported flour. Due to favourable soils, the property became the principal source of citrus fruit for Perth, and was especially known for what came to be called Cheriton oranges. It is thought that he had sourced the seeds in the Canary Islands. In the 1860s, he became involved in the public push for representative government. Eventually, the Governor of Western Australia agreed to hold informal Legislative Council elections, in the understanding that he would nominate those elected. In the informal election of May 1867, he was elected for Guildford, and was accordingly nominated to the council. He held the nominative seat until July 1870, when the council became formally elective. He contested the seat of Swan in the subsequent election, but was defeated by Thomas Courthope Gull. Two years later he contested the seat again, this time defeating Gull. He held the seat until his death at Herne Hill on 28 November 1872. Two of his sons, Henry and Edmund Ralph, became prominent farmers in the colony and Members of the Legislative Council.

The Laws of Cricket specify that only the rotation of the shoulder can be used to impart velocity to the ball – a bowler's arm must not extend during the bowling action. If the umpire deems that the ball has been thrown, they will call a no-ball which means the batsman cannot be given out from that delivery. Current regulations of the International Cricket Council (ICC) set the legal limit of 15 degrees of permissible straightening of the elbow joint for all bowlers in international cricket. This law applies between the point at which the bowling arm passes above shoulder height and the point at which the ball is released. The limit is to allow some natural flexing of the elbow joint which happens during the course of legal delivery. The charge of 'throwing' against a bowler is one of the most serious and controversial that can be made in cricket, as a bowler with an illegal action cannot dismiss a batsman. This means the player cannot effectively participate in the game, and may not be selected again without significant change to the way they bowl. Overview Tom Wills, the first Australian to be called for throwing in a top-class match Law 24, Clause 3 defines a fair delivery with respect to the arm:  History  Before the advent of developed biomechanical and audiovisual technology, this law was implemented by the field umpires, who judged a delivery as illegal or \\"thrown\\" on visual judgement alone. The law against throwing has not changed in its essence since overarm bowling was legalised in 1864. = 1800s = Tom Wills, Australia's most revered cricketer of the mid-19th century, was also its most controversial and he was often accused of (and admitted to) throwing. Many of his contemporaries recalled his trickery: \\"[Wills] used to say to the umpire, 'Just look at my feet, will you; I have a bad habit now and then of going over the crease.' The umpire would look at Tom's feet, and Tom would let go a throw for all he was worth.\\"Felix (2 February 1901). \\"The bowling trouble\\", The Australasian. In 1872 he became the first cricketer to be called for throwing in a major Australian match, effectively ending his first-class career. In the early 1880s there were a number of bowlers who were widely considered to have unfair actions, with the Lancashire pair of Jack Crossland and George Nash coming in for particular criticism. After playing for Kent against Lancashire in 1885, when he faced the bowling of Crossland and Nash, Lord Harris decided to take action. He persuaded the Kent committee to cancel the return fixture. Later that season, Crossland was found to have broken his residential qualification for Lancashire by living in Nottinghamshire and Nash dropped out of the side. Thus the two counties resumed playing each other the following season. Harris's Wisden obituarist wrote: \\"...there can be no doubt the action of Lord Harris, even if it did not entirely remove the throwing evil, had a very healthy effect on the game.\\" Jim Phillips no-balled several prominent bowlers for throwing. Sydney Pardon, the editor of Wisden, accused quick bowler Ernest Jones of throwing during Australia's tour of England in 1896 but it was left to an Australian umpire, Jim Phillips, to \\"call\\" Jones for throwing in the Melbourne Test in 1897. The same umpire ended the great C.B. Fry's bowling career by calling him for throwing. Pardon considered the end of the career of the famous Corinthian bowler \\"a case of long-delayed justice\\". Phillips went on to call Lancashire and England fast bowler Arthur Mold in 1900 and 1901, all but ending his productive career. Mold took 1,673 wickets in first-class cricket at only 15.54 apiece, bowling at high pace with a sharp 'break back' from just a four pace run up, but his bowling had always attracted as much controversy as praise. He took 192 wickets in 1895 and was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1892 but he left the first-class scene after the 1901 season and Phillips' intervention. = Early 1900s = The Australian aboriginal fast bowler Eddie Gilbert was another fast bowler who generated extreme pace from a remarkably short run. Standing tall and in weight he took wickets at a prodigious rate in the late 1920s in Queensland club cricket. He was chosen for Queensland against New South Wales Colts in 1930 and took 6 wickets but the Brisbane Courier's correspondent \\"Long On\\" was moved to describe his whipped catapult action as \\"almost a throw\\". He was picked for Queensland's Sheffield Shield side and bowled with great success. Queensland selectors responded to complaints from New South Wales by filming his arm action in slow motion but took no action against him. His most famous spell came against Don Bradman on 6 November 1931. He dismissed the NSW opener with his first ball, a vicious bouncer, then knocked Bradman's bat out of his hands with the next. The next delivery knocked Bradman over and the third had him caught behind. A month later, playing against Victoria, he was repeatedly called for throwing. He played on for Queensland, bowling at a reduced pace, and in 1934–35 headed the Queensland averages. He was a victim of legislation outlawing intimidatory bowling, in the wake of the Bodyline affair and retired in 1936, having taken 87 first-class wickets at 29.21. He later suffered from mental illness. = 1950s = An epidemic of throwing plagued cricket in the 1950s. Umpire Frank Chester wanted to no-ball the South African Cuan McCarthy for throwing in 1951 but was blocked by the authorities at Lords, Plum Warner commenting diplomatically \\"These people are our guests\\". Surrey and England left-arm spinner Tony Lock was generally thought to throw his dangerous faster ball, on one occasion Doug Insole inquiring if he had been 'bowled or run out' after Lock had shattered his stumps. He was in fact called for throwing in county cricket early in his career, and is said to have cleaned up his action towards the end of his career after seeing a bowler on video, commenting on how poor the bowler's action was and being shocked to discover it was himself. Left-arm paceman Ian Meckiff helped Australia to regain the Ashes in 1958–59 but feelings ran high in the England team and press that Meckiff and others had bowled outside the laws and spirit of the game. (Meckiff was also alleged - along with several other Australia bowlers - to be breaking the spirit of the no-ball law by \\"dragging\\" - grounding the back foot behind the bowling crease, thus making the delivery legal, but dragging it through so that it was considerably in front of the crease before the front foot landed, thus bowling from illegally close to the batsman. Following arguments over this, the no- ball law was changed to rely on the bowler's front foot being grounded behind the popping crease, rather than the back foot being grounded behind the bowling crease.) Elder statesmen on both sides, including Gubby Allen and Don Bradman, resolved to clear the air before Australia's tour of England in 1961. In 1963–64, Meckiff was called by Colin Egar in the First Test against South Africa in Brisbane, ending his career. Twenty-one-year-old South African Geoff Griffin, who had already been called when playing for Natal, was called in May 1960 while playing against MCC at Lords and his test career was ended by umpire Frank Lee who called him four times during the Second Test. Remarkably he claimed a hat trick during the test but South Africa lost by an innings, prompting an exhibition match to be staged as the Queen was due to visit the ground. Griffin was called by umpire Syd Buller, ending an over bowling underarm when he was no-balled again for not informing the umpire of a change of action. West Indian fast bowler Charlie Griffith, perhaps the most feared fast bowler of his generation, was often suspected of throwing his faster ball although he was not called in Test matches and the promising career of Derbyshire's Harold Rhodes was stunted by constant speculation about the legality of his action. He was 'called' while playing against the South African tourists in 1960 by Paul Gibb but though he was eventually cleared and played on with great success for Derbyshire through the decade, he played just twice for England. = 1990s = In more recent times bowlers such as England's James Kirtley, Australia's Brett Lee and Pakistan's Shoaib Akhtar and Shabbir Ahmed have fallen under the microscope to varying degrees. Muttiah Muralitharan's bowling action was a subject of controversy and debate for much of his career. Muttiah Muralitharan, one of the modern era's most celebrated exponents of spin bowling was dogged by controversy over his bowling action for much of his international career. From his debut for Sri Lanka he was under scrutiny from umpires due to an unusual hyperextension of his congenitally bent arm during delivery. Despite initial criticism, the first occasion when his action became a real issue was when Australian umpire Darrell Hair called him for throwing during the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne, 1995. Hair publicly stated that he wouldn't hesitate to call Murali for throwing again, given the opportunity and considered his bowling action \\"diabolical\\". The inability of cricket's officials to agree on the legality of Muralitharan's action and the reluctance of other umpires to call him for throwing meant Hair was isolated and was later excluded from officiating in matches involving Sri Lanka. Subsequent bio-mechanical tests exonerated Muralitharan's action, showing that he did not extend his arm any more than many other bowlers with legal actions. Unfortunately this testing never completely cleared his action in the eyes of his critics, who claim the extension of the arm differs between bowling in testing and in games and also when he bowls particular deliveries. During testing at the University of Western Australia several independent witnesses, including former cricketer Bruce Yardley, were present to ensure Muralitharan bowled as he would in match conditions. Since the mid-1990s when Pakistani off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq pioneered the doosra, off spinners who have bowled with a non-classical action that can produce this delivery have routinely been reported and investigated for throwing. Such bowlers include Harbhajan Singh, Shoaib Malik, Marlon Samuels, Mohammad Hafeez, Saeed Ajmal, Johan Botha, Shane Shillingford and Moeen Ali: Ali, at least, although never actually banned from bowling, has stopped attempting to bowl the doosra and now bowls classical off-spin. Saqlain is one of the few bowlers of the doosra whose action has never been called into question - although he was regularly no-balled for the more conventional sin of overstepping the crease. Biomechanics and modifications to the throwing laws Testing conducted in the 1990s in England revealed that during a delivery virtually all bowlers flex and extend their arms naturally to some degree as it rotates around the shoulder. This testing revealed that the strict Laws of Cricket which banned any flexing of the arm were impossible to follow. A set of tiered tolerance thresholds for the amount of allowable elbow extension, or straightening, were implemented: 10 degrees for fast bowlers, 7.5 degrees for medium pacers, and 5 degrees for spin bowlers. Enforcing these new measures proved problematic, as the laboratory based measurement systems used had a margin of error of at least 1 degree, and video based measurement systems were likely to have more, especially if inappropriately executed. A later study from 2000 to 2003 showed that bowling actions that looked normal to the naked eye in many of the world's elite fast bowlers had, on average, 9 degrees of elbow extension during the bowling action. Some recorded elbow extension measuring between 10 and 15 degrees, yet none of these bowlers had ever had a problem regarding the legality of their bowling action. This testing showed that a zero tolerance threshold, and the tiered thresholds implemented in the late 1990s, had no or little scientific merit. The study, conducted by the Australian Institute of Sport Biomechanics department, led by cricket biomechanist Dr. Marc Portus, involved taking three-dimensional video based biomechanical analyses during tour, test and one-day international matches in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. Results from this work indicated that video based measurement error in such a scenario, using best practice methodologies, was 3 degrees. This report was submitted to the ICC in 2003, which instigated the review of the illegal action definition and processes. Subsequent to this the ICC received data from laboratory based analyses, on the basis that these measurement environments are more controlled, involving more sophisticated measurement technologies such as the Vicon Motion Analysis system. These were subject to less measurement error. Data was provided by the Australian Institute of Sport, the University of Western Australia and the Motion Analysis Corporation system from the University of Auckland. The ICC also carried out further video based three- dimensional analyses on all bowlers during the 2004 Champions Trophy in England. Regardless of the biomechanical measurement protocol used, a strikingly similar pattern emerged: the normal biomechanics of cricket bowling, whether it be spin or pace, features an element of elbow extension. The average extension of a normal, seemingly legal delivery was 8-10 degrees for all bowler types. There were virtually zero instances of no elbow extension at all in accordance with the original laws. The ICC formed an expert panel comprising biomechanists Professor Bruce Elliott of The University of Western Australia, Dr Marc Portus of the Australian Institute of Sport and Dr Paul Hurrion from the UK who presented during a forum of a special ICC cricket sub-committee for illegal bowling actions in late 2003 in Dubai. The sub-committee was David Richardson, Angus Fraser, Aravinda De Silva, Michael Holding, Tony Lewis and Tim May. After this meeting the ICC decided to raise the elbow extension tolerance threshold to 15 degrees for all bowlers. The new 15-degree limit was chosen after considering biomechanical findings from 130 pace and spin bowlers, the scientific issues with measurement, and that bowling actions considered to be \\"throw-like\\", or illegal, were usually measured to be well above 15 degrees of elbow extension, often in the 20 to 30-degree range. Process once a bowler is reported If an umpire or match official deems that a bowler is contravening law 24.3, they detail this in the match report which is passed on the match referee. Within 24 hours of the conclusion of the match, the match referee provides the team manager and the ICC with a copy of the match report. A media statement is also issued that the player has been reported. The first step in this process is an independent review of the player's bowling action which is carried out by a member of the ICC panel of human movement specialists, who will furnish the ICC with their report. If this report concludes that the player does have an illegal action, they are immediately suspended from all international cricket until they have remedied their action. If however, only a particular delivery is illegal, they can continue to bowl in international cricket provided they do not use the delivery in question until it has been remedied. Throughout the period of this independent assessment, the player can continue to bowl in international cricket. If the player does not agree with the report, they can seek a hearing from a bowling review group made up of experts appointed by the ICC. This group will review evidence and decide, by a simple majority vote, on the legality of the player's action. If the player is cleared the suspension will be lifted immediately. A player who has been suspended from international cricket can continue to play domestic cricket under the supervision of his cricket Board. A player who has been suspended can at any time apply for a reassessment of their action. This usually happens after the player has completed a period of remedial work on their action. This reassessment is carried out in the same manner as the independent review. If the review concludes that the player has remedied their action the suspension will be lifted with immediate effect and they can start bowling in international cricket. If the player is reported and suspended a second time within two years of his last report, he is automatically suspended for a period of one year before they can apply for a reassessment of their action. This event usually ends up effectively terminating a player's international career. = Intentional throwing = In general, although players with suspect actions now tend to be reported for investigations rather than suffering a public trial in front of spectators by being no-balled, umpires still have the right to call bowlers on the field if necessary. Such a case might occur when a bowler decides to deliberately and obviously throw the odd ball in a manner akin to a javelin throw as a surprise. Such cases have occurred throughout history of a bowler whose general action is not of concern but for whatever reason has appeared to deliberately throw a ball with a vastly different action. The Australian Test bowler Laurie Nash was once no-balled in such circumstances in the 1930s, with the journalists present opining that he had deliberately thrown the ball. The same was also true of David Gower (normally a batsman, and only a very occasional bowler) in the 1986 Eng/NZ Test at Trent Bridge: with New Zealand needing just one run to win with eight wickets in hand, rather than leaving the job of conceding the final run to a specialist bowler, Gower was brought on to bowl, and threw it with a fairly blatant illegal action (he normally bowled legally on the rare occasions that he bowled), conceding a no-ball for throwing. The batsman smacked the ball to the boundary anyway, and the four runs were awarded (in those days, if runs were scored from the bat off a no-ball, these were considered to replace the normal penalty run for a no-ball: the law has subsequently changed so that the penalty run is additional to any runs scored), leaving Gower with an unusual bowling analysis of conceding 4 runs from, technically, zero deliveries. Hyperextension In a report by scientists commissioned by the ICC it was shown that Pakistani bowler Shoaib Akhtar and Indian bowler R. P. Singh were seen to extend their elbow joints by a negative angle with respect to the upper arm. This phenomenon, also known as hyperextension, can give the illusion of throwing. In the report it was seen that R. P. Singh maintained this negative angle throughout his delivery stride, while Akhtar sometimes bowled a quicker delivery by flexing this hyperextension. These actions are not considered to be chucking as they are due to the distinctive architecture of their elbows, possibly a congenital condition. Since these cricketers have no control over this hyperextension, any degree of hyperextension (past zero) is not included in the 15-degree extension tolerance threshold.

Morgan was one of about two dozen U.S. citizens to fight in the revolution and one of only three foreign nationals to hold the rank of comandante in the rebel forces.The others were Che Guevara, an Argentine citizen, and Eloy Gutiérrez Menoyo, a Spanish citizen. He turned against Castro after the revolution when Castro began to show Communist leanings, and was one of the leaders of the CIA supplied Escambray rebellion. Life before Cuba Morgan was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to Alexander Morgan and German-American Loretta Morgan (née Ruderth). Raised in an affluent Toledo neighborhood, he dropped out of high school and was often in trouble with the law.Micheal Sallah, \\"The Yankee Comandante,\\" The Toledo Blade\\", March 3-4-5, 2002 Morgan joined the United States Army after World War II and married Darlene Edgerton in 1946. The marriage was annulled after a year and a half. He was stationed with Company B, 35th Infantry, in Japan, where he fathered a son with a German-Japanese hostess named Setsuko Takeda. He went AWOL, was arrested, and escaped from custody by overpowering a guard. Recaptured, he was court-martialed in 1948, received a dishonorable discharge, and spent over two years in a federal prison. He is said to have been skilled with firearms and was rumored to have been a Central Intelligence Agency operative, though there are no public records or witness interviews to support the claim. After his discharge from the Army, Morgan apparently also worked for a local crime syndicate. On May 11, 1954, Morgan married Ellen Theresa May Bethel, a snake charmer, in Miami. They had two children, Anne Marie (1955) and William A. Morgan Jr. (1957).

From left to right: Fidel Castro, Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado, Che Guevara, Augusto Martínez Sánchez, Antonio Núñez Jiménez, William Alexander Morgan and Eloy Gutiérrez Menoyo. Opposed to the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista, Morgan abandoned his wife and children and went to Cuba in 1957, joining a guerrilla force of the Second National Front of the Escambray (Segundo Frente Nacional de Escambray or SFNE) that operated against Batista's soldiers in the Escambray Mountains in central Cuba. After distinguishing himself in a series of battles, he was promoted to the rank of comandante, leading his own column. In 1958, he wrote a statement that appeared in the New York Times to explain his participation in Castro's revolution, \\"Why I Am Here\\". It said in part: In December 1958, Che Guevara joined forces with Morgan's group and the Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil guerrillas of the Escambray mountains. Together they captured the city of Santa Clara on December 31. Twelve hours later, Batista fled Cuba. Morgan and his men occupied the city of Cienfuegos on January 1–2, 1959.Miguel A. Faria Jr., Cuba in Revolution—Escape from a Lost Paradise (2002), 69 In January 1959, he told a reporter that \\"all I'm interested in is settling down to a nice peaceful existence\\" but worried how U.S. authorities would respond to his military activities in Cuba. In March 1959, officials of the U.S. embassy in Havana warned Americans that participation in foreign military service could jeopardize their citizenship. In August 1959, Morgan gained international attention when he helped smash a coup attempt orchestrated by Dominican Republic strongman Rafael Trujillo and others by pretending to lead the takeover while quietly divulging the plot to Fidel Castro in order to help the fledgling government.New York Times: \\"A Fighter with Castro,\\" August 15, 1959, accessed June 25, 2012New York Times: \\"Trouble for Castro,\\" August 16, 1959, accessed June 25, 2012 In September 1959, the U.S. State Department revoked his citizenship, a move that was prompted by members of Congress who had supported Trujillo.

Morgan married a Cuban, Olga María Rodríguez Farinas, also a revolutionary, and they had two daughters. In August 1959, the FBI and American authorities revoked Morgan's U.S. citizenship. On September 24, 1959, Morgan renounced his U.S. citizenship publicly on a Havana radio station. After the revolution, Morgan developed a business of frog farming; with the legs being sold to restaurants, the skin for fashion accessories, and what remained for cattle feed. During this venture, Morgan employed around 600 workers and shipped an average of 50,000 pounds of frozen frog legs to the U.S. every month. On March 6, 1960, the French freighter La Coubre exploded in Havana Harbor killing around 100 people. An American named Jack Lee Evans, who was in Cuba at the time of the explosion with Morgan, left for Miami a few days after the incident. While in Miami, he gave an interview with the Miami Herald suggesting that Morgan had been involved with the sabotaging of the ship, which Morgan adamantly denied. A memorial for the explosion was held a few days later. Morgan was pictured arm and arm walking through the streets of Havana during this memorial with prominent Cuban leaders including Castro and Che. Throughout the struggle against Batista, Morgan was vocal about Castro's supposed anti-communist beliefs. When asked during interviews about Castro's political beliefs and where the new Cuban government was leaning, he remained firm in his belief that Castro was not a communist and that Cuba would become a capitalist parliamentary democracy. As Castro began to reveal his socialist leanings, Morgan became disenchanted with the revolutionary government, as did other members of the SFNE, who wanted Cuba to restore elections. In the middle of June 1960, Morgan and a select few former Escambray leaders met to discuss Castro's turn towards socialism and protecting the Revolution. As the arrests of Morgan's former rebel comrades for counterrevolutionary activities started to increase, Morgan organized weapons to be smuggled to the counterrevolutionaries in the Escambray. Arrest and execution William Alexander Morgan in prison, Havana, Cuba. 1961 On October 16, 1960, Castro ordered Morgan's arrest due to counterrevolutionary activities. Three days later, Morgan was arrested while attending a meeting for the National Institute for Agrarian Reform, to which he had been summoned. Morgan was formally charged with plotting to join and lead the counter-revolutionaries who were active in the Escambray Mountains. On March 11, 1961, shortly after a military trial at La Cabaña fortress, Morgan, then 32 years old, was shot by firing squad with Fidel and Raul Castro in attendance. One month later, 1,500 CIA trained counterrevolutionaries unsuccessfully invaded Cuba at the Bay of Pigs resulting in Castro officially declaring the Revolution a Socialist endeavor. Olga María Rodríguez Farinas was tried with him in absentia. She was found guilty of co-conspiracy and sentenced to 30 years in prison. She was released after 10 years. She left for the United States in 1980 during the Mariel boatlift. In a series of interviews with The Toledo Blade in 2002, she admitted that she and her husband had begun running guns to anti-Castro guerrillas because they were opposed to Castro's pro-Soviet leanings. She also said she wanted Morgan's U.S. citizenship restored and his remains returned to the United States for reburial. The newspaper stories prompted two Democratic members of the United States House of Representatives, Charles Rangel and Marcy Kaptur, to travel to Cuba in April 2002 to meet Fidel Castro and ask him to return Morgan's body, and Castro agreed. In April 2007, nearly 50 years after the government stripped him of his rights in 1959 for serving in a foreign country's military, the US State Department declared that Morgan's US citizenship was effectively restored.Amy Driscoll, \\"U.S. reclaims citizen who led Cuban rebel fighters,\\" Miami Herald, April 13, 2007  Morgan in pop culture  Morgan's story remained largely out of the American eye until the 21st century when articles, documentaries, and films introduced his story. In 2012, George Clooney planned to buy the rights and direct a film based on David Grann's 2012 New Yorker article on Morgan.

Built in 1954 and named in 1957 for patron Godfrey Lowell Cabot, the building houses a variety of facilities for the various teams. The arena is built on the site of the old Huntington Avenue Grounds, where the first-ever World Series baseball game was held in 1903, and is barely over a quarter-mile (402 m) away to the southwest from the Matthews Arena, the original home of the NHL's Boston Bruins ice hockey team in 1924. Cabot in 1952 Solomon Court Solomon Court at Cabot Center is the 1800-seat home to the women's basketball and volleyball teams, as well as the non-game day home of the men's basketball team. In the late 1990s, the facilities underwent a multimillion-dollar renovation culminating with the dedication of the court to long-time fan Bernard \\"Bunny\\" Solomon on November 28, 2000. The venue hosted the championship game of the ECAC North, now America East Conference men's basketball tournament in 1981. Solomon Indoor Track When the Cabot Center opened in 1954 the building included a dirt floor track & field facility, not uncommon at the time. Now known as the Solomon Indoor Track, the facilities have undergone a number of renovations, including the installation of a 120-yard banked track in 1971, followed by the installation of a flat rubber surface track. In 2008 the facilities were revamped once again, installing an embedded granule track featuring four-lane straightaways, two-lane ovals, and a pole vault pit.

He is also executive chairman of Barrick Gold Corporation and non- executive chairman of PineBridge Investments. Thornton stepped down as co- president of Goldman Sachs in 2003. Early life and education Thornton is the son of John V. Thornton, former vice chairman of the Consolidated Edison Company, and Edna Lawson Thornton, a lawyer. He attended the Hotchkiss School, and later served as President of the school's Board of Trustees. Thornton received a bachelor's degree in history from Harvard College in 1976, a B.A/M.A. in jurisprudence from Oxford University in 1978, and a master's degree in public and private management (MPPM) from the Yale School of Management in 1980. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Bank Street College of Education in 2003.http://www.brookings.edu/about/media- relations/news-releases/2003/20030611thornton Thornton was fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2007 and an honorary fellow of St. John's College, Oxford University in 2009. Career Thornton joined Goldman Sachs in 1980. In 1983, he founded Goldman Sachs' European mergers and acquisitions business. He served as co-CEO of Goldman Sachs International in London from 1995 to 1996. Thornton was Chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia from 1996 to 1998, where he expanded the firm's regional franchise during the Asian financial crisis. He became co-president of Goldman Sachs in 1999. When then- CEO Henry Paulson delayed his retirement and Thornton's expected promotion, Thornton left Goldman Sachs in 2003 and became a professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Thornton is the first non-Chinese full professor at Tsinghua University since 1949. Thornton did not speak any Chinese languages at the time of his appointment. The New York Times reported that Thornton's Goldman exit “was not met with resistance from senior management”. Thornton was non-executive chairman at Laura Ashley, the British fashion retailer, between 1995 and 2002. Thornton joined the board of directors for Ford Motor Company in 1996. William Clay Ford, Jr. – then CEO and chairman at Ford – had been friends with Thornton since their prep school days together at The Hotchkiss School. Their personal ties came under \\"sharp scrutiny\\" when William Clay Ford, Jr., received 400,000 shares in Goldman Sachs’s 1999 IPO, the largest individual award of that IPO by a large margin. In 2002, an escalating series of investigations and congressional hearings revealed that Goldman Sachs had “spun hot IPO shares to preferred clients”, mostly CEOs, as \\"an inducement to win investment banking business\\" from those clients. Goldman Sachs collected $87 million in investment fees from Ford Motor Company between 1996 and 2002. A board ethics whistle-blower described Goldman's role in the bank's activities with Ford as being \\"the umpire and pitcher in the same game\\".Landon Thomas Jr., “Ford and Goldman, So Cozy at the Top”, “The New York Times”, December 8, 2002 Thornton remains a member of Ford's compensation, finance and nominating and governance committees and is the longest serving independent director of Ford. Thornton played a significant role in helping Ford survive the financial crisis. In 2005, Thornton became the founding chairman of the Nelson Mandela Legacy Trust in the United States. In December 2008, Thornton became a board member at HSBC (the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation) and stepped down in 2013. Thornton has also served on the Boards of Intel, ICBC, China Unicom, IMG, BSkyB, DirectTV, News Corp. and on the advisory board of McKinsey. Thornton was appointed to the board of Barrick Gold in May, 2012 and became Executive Chairman of Barrick Gold in 2014. In May 2017, the government of Tanzania accused Acacia Mining, a subsidiary of Barrick Gold, of “under-reporting its gold exports by a factor of ten”. The investigation revealed that copper and silver were also under-reported, and sulfur, iron, iridium, titanium and zinc were present, but not accounted for. The Tanzanian government then imposed a ban on the export of gold and copper concentrates. The accusation and ban halved Acacia’s market value.“Tanzania’s firebrand leader takes on its largest gold miner”, “The Economist”, June 15, 2017 In October 2017, Thornton met with John Magufuli, then president of Tanzania, for six hours, emerging with a preliminary deal that included a $300 million payment for back taxes from Acacia to the Tanzanian government, as well as the Tanzanian government taking a 16% stake in Acacia’s mines.“New Barrick set to end Tanzania tax dispute - CEO”, “Standard Digital” Thornton reportedly did not tell Acacia the terms of the proposal until after the deal was announced, even though Acacia, not Barrick, would be responsible for the payment.Thomas Wilson and Omar Mohammed, “Barrick-Brokered Tanazania Pact Leaves Acacia in the Dark”, “Bloomberg”, October 20, 2017 Shortly after Thornton’s deal with Magufuli was announced, Acacia’s top executives – CEO Brad Gordon, CFO Andrew Wray and COO Mark Morcombe, under whose tenure relations with the Tanzanian government had deteriorated – resigned.Thomas Wilson and Omar Mohammed, “Barrick’s Trouble in Tanzania Deepens as Acacia Chiefs Depart”, “Bloomberg”, November 2, 2017 The resolution allowed Acacia and Barrick to resume operations in Tanzania. In January 2020, Barrick formalized a joint venture with the Tanzanian government covering the North Mata, Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi mines. On September 24, 2018, Barrick Gold announced plans to acquire London-listed Randgold Resources in a transformational deal valued at more than $6.5 billion. The merger solidified Barrick's position as one of the world's largest gold mining companies, with proven and probable reserves of 78 million ounces of gold and dominant land positions in many of the world's major gold producing regions. Thornton led the all-stock, nil-premium merger, which earned the support of more than 95% of the shareholders of both companies. In February 2019, Barrick Gold announced a hostile $19 billion bid to acquire Newmont Mining Corporation, an American company based in Denver, Colorado. Newmont’s board unanimously rejected the offer, describing Barrick’s “egocentric proposal” as “designed to transfer value from Newmont shareholders to Barrick’s”. Newmont CEO Gary Goldberg said, “[O]ne of the major factors that hindered Barrick’s ability to create value in the past remains the same… John Thornton is still firmly in control.” Newmont later reversed this position and agreed to enter into a joint venture with Barrick in Nevada. In August 2020, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had purchased 20.9 million shares of Barrick Gold, a position valued at $563.5 million by the end of the second quarter of 2020. Thornton currently serves as Chair Emeritus of The Brookings Institution and Co-Chair of the Asia Society. In addition to these academic and research affiliations, Thornton has also authored forewords for three books, including \\"Social Ethics in a Changing China\\", \\"China in 2020\\" and \\"Democracy is a Good Thing\\". Interest in China Thornton's interest in China stretches to at least November 1997, when Goldman Sachs assisted China Telecom with its $4.2 billion IPO, one of the first international listings of a Chinese state-owned company. By the time Thornton stepped down from his position at Goldman, the bank had become the lead underwriter for major Chinese state-owned companies. Thornton joined the board of trustees of the Brookings Institution in May 2000, and became chairman in June 2003. Brookings established the John L. Thornton China Center in 2006 with an initial $12.5M donation from John Thornton. The center has offices in Washington and Beijing and provides recommendations to decision makers in China and the West. In November 2018, Thornton stepped down as board chair and became chair emeritus. In 2009, he became an inaugural member of the International Advisory Council of the Chinese sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation. Thornton was an original member of the Schwarzman Scholars board of trustees, founded in 2013 by Stephen A. Schwarzman. Thornton's son, J. R. Thornton, was named a Schwarzman Scholar in 2017. In September 2017, Thornton helped arrange a meeting between Steve Bannon and Wang Qishan, Thornton’s friend and former head of the China Construction Bank and the current Vice President of the People’s Republic of China,Rachelle Younglai, “The man with the key to China: Barrick Gold’s quest to open new doors” “The Globe and Mail”, December 6, 2013 at the Communist Party’s Zhongnanhai headquarters a few weeks after Bannon was forced out of his advisory role in President Donald Trump’s administration.Mark Landler, “In Beijing and Abu Dhabi, Signs of Bannon’s Continued Influence”, “The New York Times”, September 22, 2017 Bannon, also a former Goldman employee, has described Thornton as a friend and mentor. Thornton, along side Secretary of Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, and US Trade Representative Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, served as one of the architects of Phase I of the US-China trade deal.  Interest in Mongolia  Over his career, Thornton has built relationships with leaders of countries in which his current and former companies have conducted business. Some of these relationships include South African President, Nelson Mandela, US President, Donald Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Félix Tshisekedi, president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, John Magufuli, president of Tanzania, Malcolm Turnbull, Prime Minister of Australia and former president of Mongolia Nambaryn Enkhbayar. Thornton developed a friendship with Enkhbayar, who was arrested in April 2012 by Mongolia’s anti-corruption commission after being accused of misuse of state property while in office. Thornton played a key role in a campaign led by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) to gain international support for Enkhbayar, who had been convicted by a government court in August 2012.Michael Kohn, Mongolian President Pardoned After 2012 Graft Conviction”. Bloomberg, August 1, 2013. Retrieved July 21, 2019. Senator Feinstein took the position that due process of law had not been followed in Enkhbayar's trial. Enkhbayar was released and pardoned by the new President of Mongolia Recognition In 2007, Institutional Investor Magazine named John Thornton one of forty individuals who have had the greatest influence in shaping global financial markets over the past forty years. He received the 2009 Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) Achievement Award, which every year honors one past participant in collegiate tennis who has made unique contributions to society as well as achieving excellence in their careers. Thornton appeared on the National Post's 2017 Power List of the most influential people shaping Canadian business. The newspaper noted Thornton has \\"overseen a massive overhaul at Toronto-based Barrick\\" following which the company \\"has shed billions of dollars of debt and generated excellent financial results.\\" In 2008, he was awarded the Friendship Award of the People's Republic of China, the highest honor accorded to a non-Chinese citizen. The Chinese government also named him as one of fifteen 'foreign experts' who have made the most significant contribution to China's development over the past three decades. Personal life Thornton is married to Margaret Bradham Thornton, an American author whose works include the novels, Charleston and A Theory of Love. The Thorntons have four children. The Thorntons live in Palm Beach, Florida. Disputes between the Thorntons and their neighbors have led to multiple lawsuits. In 2011, The Wall Street Journal reported on the vast water consumption of wealthy Palm Beach residents during exceptional drought conditions. Thornton was listed as a top-five water user, having consumed 8,698,492 gallons between June 2010 and May 2011. The average Palm Beach resident consumes 108,000 gallons per year.

Momentum is conserved, as is necessary for phase-matching, through an additional momentum contribution corresponding to the wavevector of the periodic structure. Consequently, in principle any three-wave mixing process that satisfies energy conservation can be phase-matched. For example, all the optical frequencies involved can be collinear, can have the same polarization, and travel through the medium in arbitrary directions. This allows one to use the largest nonlinear coefficient of the material in the nonlinear interaction. Quasi-phase-matching ensures that there is positive energy flow from the pump frequency to signal and idler frequencies even though all the frequencies involved are not phase locked with each other. Energy will always flow from pump to signal as long as the phase between the two optical waves is less than 180 degrees. Beyond 180 degrees, energy flows back from the signal to the pump frequencies. The coherence length is the length of the medium in which the phase of pump and the sum of idler and signal frequencies are 180 degrees from each other. At each coherence length the crystal axes are flipped which allows the energy to continue to positively flow from the pump to the signal and idler frequencies. The most commonly used technique for creating quasi-phase-matched crystals has been periodic poling.Paschotta, Rüdiger. \\"Quasi-phase matching.\\" Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology. Retrieved April 30, 2006 More recently, continuous phase control over the local nonlinearity was achieved using nonlinear metasurfaces with homogeneous linear optical properties but spatially varying effective nonlinear polarizability. Mathematical description In nonlinear optics, the generation of other frequencies is the result of the nonlinear polarization response of the crystal due to fundamental pump frequency. When the crystal axis is flipped, the polarization wave is shifted by 180°, thus ensuring that there is a positive energy flow to the signal and idler beam. In the case of sum-frequency generation, polarization equation can be expressed by : P_3 = 4d A_1 A_2 e^{i(k_1+k_2)z}, where d is the nonlinear susceptibility coefficient, in which the sign of the coefficient is flipped when the crystal axis is flipped, and i represents the imaginary unit. : P_3 = -4d A_1 A_2 e^{i(k_1+k_2)z} = 4d A_1 A_2 e^{i((k_1+k_2)z+\\\\pi)}. Development of signal amplitude The following mathematical description assumes a constant pump amplitude. The signal wavelength can be expressed as a sum over the number of domains that exist in the crystal. In general the rate of change of the signal amplitude is \\\\frac{\\\\partial A_2}{\\\\partial z}=A_1^2 \\\\chi e^{i \\\\Delta k z}, where A_2 is the generated frequency amplitude and A_1 is the pump frequency amplitude and \\\\Delta k is the phase mismatch between the two optical waves. The \\\\chi refers to the nonlinear susceptibility of the crystal. In the case of a periodically poled crystal the crystal axis is flipped by 180 degrees in every other domain, which changes the sign of \\\\chi. For the n^{th} domain \\\\chi can be expressed as \\\\chi=\\\\chi_0 (-1)^n where n is the index of the poled domain. The total signal amplitude A_2 can be expressed as a sum A_2=A_1^2 \\\\chi_0 \\\\sum^{N-1}_{n=0} (-1)^n \\\\int^{\\\\Lambda (n+1)}_{\\\\Lambda n} e^{i \\\\Delta k z} \\\\partial z where \\\\Lambda is the spacing between poles in the crystal. The above equation integrates to A_2=-\\\\frac{i A_1^2 \\\\chi_0}{\\\\Delta k} \\\\sum^{N-1}_{n=0} (-1)^n (e^{i \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda (n+1)}-e^{i \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda n}) and reduces to A_2=-i A_1^2 \\\\chi_0 \\\\frac{e^{i \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda}-1}{\\\\Delta k} \\\\sum^{N-1}_{n=0} (-1)^n e^{i \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda n} The summation yields s=\\\\sum^{N-1}_{n=0} (-1)^n e^{i \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda n}=1-e^{i \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda}+e^{i 2 \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda}-e^{i 3 \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda}+...+(-1)^N e^{i \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda (N-2)}-(-1)^N e^{i \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda (N-1)}. Multiply above equation both sides by a factor of e^{i \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda} s e^{i \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda}=e^{i \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda} -e^{i 2 \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda}+e^{i 3 \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda}+...+(-1)^N e^{i \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda (N-1)}-(-1)^N e^{i \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda N}. Adding both equation leads to the relation s(1+e^{i \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda})=1-(-1)^N e^{i \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda N}. Solving for s gives s=\\\\frac{1-(-1)^N e^{i \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda N} }{1+e^{i \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda}}, which leads to A_2=-i A_1^2 \\\\chi_0 \\\\left( \\\\frac{e^{i \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda}-1}{\\\\Delta k} \\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\frac{1-(-1)^N e^{i \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda N}}{e^{i \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda}+1}\\\\right). The total intensity can be expressed by I_2=A_2 A_2^*= \\\\left|A_{1}\\\\right|^{4} \\\\chi_0^2 \\\\Lambda^2 \\\\mbox{sinc}^2(\\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda/2) \\\\left(\\\\frac{1-(-1)^N \\\\cos(\\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda N)}{1+\\\\cos(\\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda)} \\\\right). For the case of \\\\Lambda=\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{\\\\Delta k} the right part of the above equation is undefined so the limit needs to be taken when \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda \\\\rightarrow \\\\pi by invoking L'Hôpital's rule. \\\\lim_{\\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda\\\\to\\\\pi}\\\\frac{1-(-1)^N \\\\cos(\\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda N)}{1+\\\\cos(\\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda)}=N^2 Which leads to the signal intensity I_2=\\\\frac{4 \\\\left|A_{1}\\\\right|^{4} \\\\chi_0^2 L^2}{\\\\pi^2}. In order to allow different domain widths, i.e. \\\\Lambda=\\\\frac{m \\\\pi}{\\\\Delta k}, for m=1,3,5,..., the above equation becomes I_2=A_2 A_2^*= \\\\left|A_{1}\\\\right|^{4}\\\\chi_0^2 \\\\Lambda^2 \\\\mbox{sinc}^2(m \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda/2) \\\\left(\\\\frac{1-(-1)^N \\\\cos(m \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda N)}{1+\\\\cos(m \\\\Delta k \\\\Lambda)} \\\\right). With \\\\Lambda = \\\\frac{m \\\\pi}{\\\\Delta k} the intensity becomes I_2=\\\\frac{4 \\\\left|A_{1}\\\\right|^{4} \\\\chi_0^2 L^2}{m^2 \\\\pi^2}. This allows quasi-phase-matching to exist at different domain widths \\\\Lambda. From this equation it is apparent, however, that as the quasi-phase match order m increases, the efficiency decreases by m^2 . For example, for 3rd order quasi-phase matching only a third of the crystal is effectively used for the generation of signal frequency, as a consequence the amplitude of the signal wavelength only third of the amount of amplitude for same length crystal for 1st order quasi-phase match. Calculation of domain width The domain width is calculated through the use of Sellmeier equation and using wavevector relations. In the case of DFG this relationship holds true \\\\Delta k = k_1 - k_2 - k_3, where k_1, k_2, \\\\mbox{and } k_3 are the pump, signal, and idler wavevectors, and k_i = \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi n(\\\\lambda_i)}{\\\\lambda_i}. By calculating \\\\Delta k for the different frequencies, the domain width can be calculated from the relationship \\\\Lambda = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{\\\\Delta k}.

Originally it was used only to refer to women's skirts, as men wore a loincloth, called a maro. Nowadays the term is applied to any piece of cloth worn wrapped around the body, worn by males or females. It is related to the Malay sarong, Filipino malong, tapis and patadyong, Samoan lavalava, Tongan tupenu and other such garments of the Pacific Islands such as the Hawaiian Islands, Marquesas Islands, New Zealand, and Fiji.  Etymology  In contemporary Tahitian the right word is pāreu (singular: te pāreu, plural: te mau pāreu), with the pronunciation of the word with a long a (hold the sound for two beats rather than just one) and the e and u pronounced separately, rather than slurred into a diphthong: [pɑːreu]. It is not clear where the variant pareo comes from. It might be an old dialectic variant or an early explorers' misinterpretation. But both terms were already used in the 19th century (the Dutch geographic magazine De Aarde en haar Volken of 1887 had a few South-seas articles, some of them using pāreu, others pareo). Nowadays, however, pareo can be considered as the English-language form of the word (plural pareos), much less likely subject to mispronunciation. Styles Hiva Oa dancers dressed in pāreu around 1909 The Tahitian pāreu are among the most colourful and bright of the Pacific. Originally flower patterns, the hibiscus flowers in particular, or traditional tapa patterns, were printed in bright colours on a cotton sheet of about 90 or 120 cm wide and 180 cm long. Nowadays they are also made in Tahiti itself and dye painting with varying colours is popular as well. A pāreu can be worn in many ways. Women will usually wrap it around their upper body, covering it from breasts to above the knees. Either they rely on their breasts for it not to slide down, or they may wrap a corner around their shoulder or their neck. In more traditional surroundings the covering of the upper body is less important, but the covering of the thighs is. Then it is worn as a longer skirt. Men wear it as a short skirt, or may even make shorts out of it, especially when fishing or working in the bush where freedom of movement of the legs is needed. But during quiet, cooler nights at home, they may wear it as a long skirt too. The ends of the pāreu are normally tied in a knot to keep it in place.

Its buildings include a motor vehicle and farm equipment workshop, the Ti Tree Hotel, a church, a fire brigade station manned by volunteers and a community hall. Warrion sits at the foot of Warrion Hill. At the , Warrion had a population of 198. There are a number of early and important references (see below) to first contact with local aboriginal inhabitants. Warrion Post Office opened on 24 August 1875 and closed in 1976. The general store was owned throughout the 1950s and until 1980 by George Glover and his wife, Rosie. The Glovers drove a 100E Ford Prefect panel van and sold home-made lunchtime pies to schools across the district. Mr Glover sold the pies from a pie warmer from the rear tailgate. His wife, Rosie, sat on the tailgate dispensing tomato sauce for a penny a serve. The Glovers sold meat, fish, vegetable, apple and apricot pies. Augustus (Gus) Goonan owned and operated the Ti Tree Hotel, and the service station was owned and operated by Stan Tune. Main rural industries included cropping of peas and onions, and dairy farming. Warrion has important groundwater resources which are used widely in local farming activities. Farming families included Leahy, Carroll, Kerr, Hay, Cowley, Chant, De Lorenzo, Monaco and Illett. In recent years, farms have been absorbed into larger landholdings, with an associated decline in rural population. Underground water storage is under threat due to a prolonged drought and an increase in irrigation from large capacity bores on huge dairy farms. The historic stone walls have recently been roughly plundered without consideration for heritage or visual appeal. The walls have been bulldozed and transported for sale into metropolitan landscaping businesses by some local large dairy farming enterprises. Warrion Oval The Warrion recreation reserve is managed by the Warrion Recreation Reserve Committee. The Victorian Cricket Association have scheduled the occasional Premier grade cricket match at the Warrion Oval since 2006, attracting several well-known Australian cricketers as well as large crowds. The oval was home to the Warrion Football Club, which used to compete in the Colac & District Football League until the team disbanded at the end of 1985. The team won the 1938 and 1952 premierships. Curator Eric Hay is renowned across the state for the high quality outfields and turf wickets he produces. A turf wicket was first put in place in 1980 and is regarded as one of the best regional cricketing facilities in Victoria. Warrion Cricket Club The Warrion Cricket Club is one steeped in history since its formation in the late 1880s. The club now competes in the Colac District Cricket Association. Its first premiership came in the late 1970s before the club entered its golden era of the 1980s and 1990s when it regularly competed in finals. The club's most recent premiership came in the 2009-10 season when it defeated the Alvie Cricket Club at the Warrion recreation reserve. Jarrod Stinchombe was named man of the match taking four wickets in a commanding win under the guidance of Ray Barrow. The club has produced several district cricketers including Gavin Holland (Richmond) and Phillip Lang (North-Melbourne - Geelong). The club currently fields three Senior teams and Junior teams.

His father was from Iasi, Romania and his mother from Rostov-na-Donu, Russia. Julius Josephson was a printer who became a bank president before his death in 1925. Matthew Josephson graduated from Columbia University and married Hannah Geffen in 1920. They lived in Europe in the 1920s. His wife, librarian of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and an author in her own right, worked closely with her husband on various projects throughout their careers. In 1945 she and Malcolm Cowley edited Aragon, Poet of the Resistance. Matthew and Hannah Josephson collaborated on Al Smith: Hero of the Cities in 1969. They had two sons, Eric and Carl. Initially Josephson wrote poetry, published in Galimathias (1923), and reported for various \\"little magazines.\\" He became associate editor of Broom: An International Magazine of the Arts (1922–24) and contributing editor of Transition (1928–29). Josephson was also a regular contributor to The New Republic, The Nation, The New Yorker, and the Saturday Evening Post. Josephson's first biographies were Zola and His Time (1928) and Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1932). Influenced by Charles A. Beard and the Depression, and with only one major exception, Stendhal: or the Pursuit of Happiness (1946), Josephson changed his focus of interest from literature to economic history when he published The Robber Barons in 1934. This was followed by more full- length works in which Josephson served as a spokesman for intellectuals of his generation who were dissatisfied with the social and political status quo. Josephson wrote two memoirs, Life Among the Surrealists (1962) and Infidel in the Temple (1967). He died on March 13, 1978 at the Community Hospital in Santa Cruz, California. Legacy Josephson's collected papers are in the Yale Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University.

The gopher tortoise is grouped with land tortoises that originated 60 million years ago, in North America. A genetic study has shown that their closest relatives are in the Asian genus Manouria. The gopher tortoises live in the southern United States from California's Mojave Desert across to Florida, and in parts of northern Mexico. Gopher tortoises are so named because of their ability to dig large, deep burrows; those of the gopher tortoise can be up to in length and in depth. These burrows are used by a variety of other species, including mammals, other reptiles, amphibians, and birds. Gopher tortoises are in length, depending on the species. All six species are found in xeric habitats. Numerous extinct species are known, the oldest dating to the Priabonian stage of the Late Eocene of the United States. Diet Gopher tortoises are mainly herbivores that feed on low growing plant life. Their diet consists mostly of grasses and legumes. Gopher tortoises are scavengers and will also feed on small berries, fruits, carrion, and excrement. Gopher tortoises are rarely seen drinking from still water. Most of the water gopher tortoises consume comes from within the food they eat. Desert rortoise (Gopherus agassizii) San Bernardino County, California, US. Breeding Gopher tortoises usually mate during April and May. The female will then choose either a sunny spot nearby or a sandy mound in front of her burrow to lay between 3 and 15 eggs. The eggs then hatch from 70 to 100 days later. Once hatched, the baby tortoises spend most of their time in their mother's burrow until they learn to dig their own burrow. They do not reach maturity until they are around 10 to 15 years old. Gopher tortoises have an abbreviated mating season in early spring, when male tortoises visit the female tortoise' burrows and mate with them.Landers, L. J.; Garner, J. A. & McRae, W. A. (1980). \\"Reproduction on Gopher Tortoises in Southwestern Georgia\\". Herpetological. 36: 353–361. Species In July 2011, researchers decided on the basis of DNA and behavioral data that the Sonoran and Mojave populations of the desert tortoise were distinct species.US Geological Survey As such, there are currently six recognized species in the genus Gopherus: Listed alphabetically by binomial name:Gopherus, The Reptile Database * Mojave desert tortoise or Agassiz's desert tortoise, Gopherus agassizii (Cooper, 1863) * Texas tortoise, Gopherus berlandieri (Agassiz, 1857) * Sinaloan desert tortoise or Goode's desert tortoise, Gopherus evgoodei Edwards et al., 2016 * Bolson tortoise, Gopherus flavomarginatus Legler, 1959 * Sonoran desert tortoise or Morafka's desert tortoise, Gopherus morafkai Murphy et al., 2011 * Gopher tortoise, Gopherus polyphemus (Daudin, 1802) Members of Gopherus that became extinct in the late Pleistocene: * Gopherus donlaloi (Reynoso and Montellano-Ballesteros, 2004) Conservation Texas tortoise (Gopherus berlandieri), northern Tamaulipas, Mexico Populations of all six species of Gopherus have declined dramatically. In the past, gopher tortoises were hunted for their meat, which was used in stews.\\"Gopher Tortoise Stew\\", in: Recipes from Another Time: Savor the flavor of old St. Augustine and try a couple of these original recipes. Smithsonian magazine, October 2001 Currently the most significant threat to their survival is habitat destruction, but the pet trade and collisions with vehicles have also taken their toll. To help decrease gopher tortoise death due to collisions with vehicles, the US Department of Transportation in Mississippi has recently placed angled fences along the road side to keep tortoise from wandering onto the highways near their habitats. On November 9, 2009, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed rulemaking to include the eastern population of the gopher tortoise, Gopherus polyphemus, in the List of Threatened Wildlife.

Radioseven was concentrated on broadcasting mainly dance music, with appearances of live program hosts during peak hours. It stopped broadcasting in April 2017.http://www.radioseven.se/ The station, originally named 7UP-Radio, started broadcasting on August 8, 1999. It was a young Swede named Patrick Westerlund, who together with friends he had met on the IRC network DALnet, started the radio as a hobby project. Over the years the station has striven to become more serious and professional. Some of these steps are the renaming of 7UP-Radio to Radioseven in February 2002, and the establishment of the non-profit association Seven Broadcasting. During the autumn of 2005, Seven Broadcasting launched two new online radio stations: the house and trance oriented Mysteria: The Club Experience, and ICE playing mostly hip hop and modern R'n'B. These two stations had to be shut down after about six months due to high license fees and the limited economic resources of Seven Broadcasting. Radioseven has for several years been a partner of the LAN party Dreamhack. During Dreamhack Winter in 2006, the station broadcast over FM for the first time and could be heard all over Jönköping where Dreamhack is held, on 107.0 MHz.

Standing 6'5\\" and weighing 235 lbs., McGraw was fresh from action with the U.S. Marine Corps in World War II when he enrolled at Colorado State University in 1946, when it was known as Colorado A&M.; Working diligently at his game, McGraw called upon lessons learned as a boxer and wrestler to fashion himself into a special breed of football player. His arm strength was crushing to opposing players and his agility developed through wrestling served him well when fending off enemy linemen. Colorado A&M; finished 2–7 in McGraw's freshman season, but things would change quickly. As a sophomore, McGraw helped his Rams post a 5–4–1 mark, the team's best record in 11 years. Then, in 1948, the Aggies posted upsets over rivals Utah State, Wyoming, BYU and archrival Colorado. The 1949 campaign, McGraw's last as a four-year letterman, saw the Aggies log a 9–1 record marred only by a loss to Wyoming. After graduation, McGraw joined the Detroit Lions and captured Rookie of the Year and All-Pro honors. In 1981, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. While at Colorado State, McGraw was the school's first football All-American in 1949. When he returned to CSU in later years as a staff member, he also served as the athletic director from 1976 to 1986.

Kirby is said to have received his M.A. in England, probably at Cambridge, before converting to Catholicism at Louvain and entering Douai College in 1576. He was ordained a priest at Cambrai in September 1577 and left Rheims for England on 3 May 1578; however, he returned on 15 July and went to Rome. There he took the college oath at the English College, Rome, 23 April 1579. During his stay at the College he practised charity towards his countrymen in Rome who needed help, Catholic and non-Catholic. He helped them from his slender purse, and once went forty miles out of Rome to see some safe on the way. It was in Rome that he met the spy/informer Munday, who later gave false testimony against him.Challoner, Richard. Memoirs of Missionary Priests, Thomas Richardson & son, 1843, p. 110 He was chosen to accompany Campion and Ralph Sherwin on their way to England, and the three set out from Rome on 14 April 1580, arriving in Rheims on 31 May.

Previously, she was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as the Liberal Party of Canada's candidate in the Toronto riding of Willowdale in a federal by-election held on March 17, 2008, to fill a vacancy created by former Liberal MP Jim Peterson's resignation. She was re-elected in the 2008 general election but lost her seat in the 2011 election. She had previously been the party's candidate for Newmarket—Aurora in the 2004 federal election, losing narrowly to Conservative candidate Belinda Stronach, and the first declared candidate for the Liberal Party leadership election to succeed Paul Martin in 2006. She was also an unsuccessful candidate in the 2013 leadership race. Early life and career Born in Toronto, Hall Findlay lived in York Mills, attending the Toronto French School until Grade 8 when she was 13 and her parents separated. She moved with her mother to Thornbury, at the base of the Blue Mountains, east of Owen Sound. She skipped three grades (9, 10 and 11) to enter Grade 12 at Georgian Bay Secondary School in Meaford, and graduated from high school at 15. Hall Findlay was overall silver medallist in the 1976 Canadian Ski Championship, and was named to the national training squad before retiring from competition to concentrate on her education. She graduated in international relations from the University of Toronto, and in law from Osgoode Hall Law School at York University. Through university, she worked as a waitress, carpenter and ski race coach; while completing law school, she co- owned and operated two retail stores, living above the Yonge St. store. While in the International Relations Program she married Doug Findlay and, in her second year in 1981, gave birth to her first child, Katie. At Osgoode Hall Law School she had two more children, Everett in '83 and Patrick in '85, receiving her LL.B. in 1987. At the same time her mother went back for her university degree at age 60. In Hall Findlay's professional career she worked for six years practicing corporate and commercial law at the Toronto offices of international law firm Baker McKenzie (then known as Baker & Mckenzie), served as general counsel and executive for Bell Mobility and Mobility Canada, and later served as vice-president and general counsel for The Rider Group. After moving to Collingwood, Ontario in 1996, she founded The General Counsel Group, a legal and management consulting firm working primarily in the high-tech and telecommunications fields in Canada and Europe. In 2007, she joined the law firm of Gowlings Lafleur Henderson LLP as counsel. After losing her seat in the 2011 election Hall Findlay became the chief legal officer at EnStream LP and an Executive Fellow at the University of Calgary’s School of Public Policy. Political career In the 2004 federal election, the presumptive Liberal Party candidate in the riding of Newmarket—Aurora bowed out, not wanting to run for the scandal-plagued Liberal Party. Hall Findlay, still residing in Collingwood, was parachuted into the riding to challenge Conservative candidate Belinda Stronach, a wealthy local executive nationally famous for her candidacy in the Conservative leadership election earlier that year. While Stronach was thought to have a large lead on election night Hall Findlay came within 687 votes of winning the seat. Hall Findlay was dedicated to winning the seat in the next election, she moved to the riding and was acclaimed as the Liberal candidate for the new election. However, on May 17, 2005, Stronach crossed the floor to join the Liberal Party caucus, and Hall Findlay stepped down as the candidate to allow Stronach to run under the Liberal banner. With nominations closed in other Toronto area ridings she was not a candidate in the 2006 election. =2006 Leadership bid= Martha Hall Findlay's Big Red Bus. Martha Hall Findlay on the morning of the last day of the Liberal Leadership race, having just endorsed Dion. The Liberal Party was defeated in the 2006 election and Paul Martin announced his intentions to step down as leader of the Liberal Party. On February 8, 2006, Hall Findlay became the first declared candidate for the Liberal Party leadership election to succeed Paul Martin. As the lowest profile of the candidates she jokingly referred to herself as \\"Martha Who Who\\". Hall Findlay made up for her lack of profile with an ambitious grassroots campaign that also included driving across the country in a motor home, which became known as the \\"big red bus\\". She described herself as fiscally conservative, socially progressive and the candidate who could bridge the gap between the Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin factions of the party. Political commentator Chantal Hébert wrote that out of the three women vying for the leadership, former cabinet ministers Carolyn Bennett and Hedy Fry dropped out mid-campaign, Hall Findlay \\"is the only one who has the necessary language credentials and the presence that front-line politicians are made of.\\" Her two key issues in the race were the environment and health care. She believed that the Kyoto climate change protocol was worth pursuing and favoured private health care, but from a universal, single-tier and publicly funded system. Towards the end of the campaign Hall Findlay was endorsed by York West Member of Parliament Judy Sgro, she was the only member of the Liberal caucus to endorse Hall Findlay's candidacy. Along with Stéphane Dion she also received a newspaper endorsement from the Toronto Sun. Hall Findlay finished last on the first ballot with 2.7% of the vote and threw her support behind eventual winner Dion. On December 18, 2006, Dion appointed Hall Findlay as the party's platform outreach chair. In her role she traveled across the country engaging Canadians on ideas for the party's election platform. =Willowdale MP= Hall Findlay was appointed as the Liberal candidate in the Toronto riding of Willowdale by Dion in 2007, after Liberal MP Jim Peterson announced he would not seek re-election. Willowdale was considered to be one of the Liberal Party's safest seats in the country and Hall Findlay's victory was almost guaranteed. Only months after announcing he would not seek re-election Peterson resigned from parliament, leading to a by- election to be held on March 17, 2008. Findlay faced Conservative candidate Maureen Harquail, NDP candidate Rini Ghosh, and Green Party candidate Lou Carcasole. On by-election night, Hall Findlay won nearly 60 per cent of the popular vote. Later that year she was re-elected in the general election, though her share of the popular vote fell below 49 per cent. Dion resigned as Liberal leader in October 2008, following the party's poor showing the general election weeks prior. Hall Findlay was mentioned as a potential candidate for the leadership of the party, but announced in November that she would not be seeking the leadership. Outstanding debt from her leadership bid, as well as from the by-election and general election factored into her reason for not seeking the leadership. In December 2008 leadership candidates Dominic LeBlanc and Bob Rae dropped out of the race and Michael Ignatieff was acclaimed as party leader. Under Dion and Ignatieff she held several important Critic positions in the Official Opposition: Associate Finance; Transport, Infrastructure and Communities; Public Works and Government Services, and International Trade. With the Liberal Party finishing behind the Conservatives and NDP for the first time in the 2011 federal election Hall Findlay was narrowly defeated in her own riding by Conservative Chungsen Leung. =2013 leadership bid= Hall Findlay during a candidates debate on February 16, 2013, in Mississauga Ignatieff resigned as leader following the party's showing in the 2011 election. Despite her defeat in that election, Hall Findlay made no secret of her interest in seeking the leadership of the party in the 2013 leadership race. However, with outstanding debt from her 2006 leadership bid, Hall Findlay stated that she would not run for leader until that debt was paid off. In October 2012, she announced that she had paid off the remainder of the debt and on November 14, 2012, she announced her candidacy for the leadership of the Liberal Party. While Justin Trudeau was widely viewed as the frontrunner in the race, Hall Findlay was considered among the top-tier of candidates. On April 14, 2013, she lost the leadership election to Montreal MP Justin Trudeau. In June 2012, as an Executive Fellow with the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary, Hall Findlay, released a paper that called for an end to the supply management system in Canada's dairy, poultry and egg sectors. At the launch of her leadership bid on November 14, 2012, she stated that with the exception of \\"some politicians and dairy farmers\\" the reaction to her proposal to abolish supply management had been \\"overwhelmingly positive.\\" Hall Findlay also announced she would be releasing policy papers every few weeks of the five month race, her first policy proposal called for a national energy strategy for energy infrastructure. According to Elections Canada, Hall Findlay's campaign brought in $149,877.45 in donations in the fourth quarter of 2012, originally believed to be second only to Justin Trudeau who brought in $673,156.53. However, a discrepancy involving money raised to pay off her leadership debt from the 2006 races appears to have slid her into third behind Marc Garneau. Hall Findlay's campaign was managed by Stephen Carter, who managed the Calgary Mayoral campaign of Naheed Nenshi and the Alberta PC campaign under leader Alison Redford. Post-political career After her 2011 election loss, Hall Findlay moved to Calgary where she became an Executive Fellow with the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary. From 2011 to 2016, she was also the chief legal officer at EnStream. From 2016 to 2019, Hall Findlay was president and CEO of the Canada West Foundation think tank. In 2020, she joined Suncor as Chief Sustainability Officer.

Career Demsetz grew up on the West Side of Chicago, the grandchild of Jewish immigrants from central and eastern Europe. He studied engineering, forestry, and philosophy at four universities before being awarded a B.A. (1953) in economics from the University of Illinois, and an MBA (1954) and a Ph.D. (1959) from Northwestern University. While a graduate student, he published an article each in Econometrica and the Journal of Political Economy. Demsetz taught at the University of Michigan (1958–60), UCLA, 1960–63, and the Graduate School of Business at the University of Chicago, 1963–71. In 1971, he returned permanently to UCLA's Economics Department, which he chaired 1978–80. He held the Arthur Andersen UCLA Alumni Chair in Business Economics, 1986–95. He has been affiliated with the Center for Naval Analyses and the Hoover Institution. Demsetz was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a director of the Mont Pelerin Society, and a past (1996) president of the Western Economics Association. Work Demsetz belonged to the Chicago school of economic theory, and was one of the pioneers of the approach now called New Institutional Economics. He is a founder of the field of managerial economics. He has expanded the theory of property rights now prevalent in law and economics. Even though Demsetz never employed game theory, he is a major figure in industrial organization through his writings on the theory of the firm, antitrust policy, and business regulation. His expository style is devoid of mathematical formalism to an extent unusual for someone who began his career after 1950. His principal influences include Frank Knight and a number of colleagues: Armen Alchian, Ronald Coase, Aaron Director, and George Stigler. Demsetz coined the term \\"nirvana fallacy\\" in 1969.

It has an area of 95,212 acres (385 km2). It is bordered by M-28 and M-77. The nearest town of any size is Seney, Michigan. The refuge contains the Seney Wilderness Area and the Strangmoor Bog National Natural Landmark within its boundaries. Birds, animals and wilderness While the Seney National Wildlife Refuge is oriented towards maintaining living space for bird life, river otters, beavers, moose, black bears and wolves also live in the refuge. 211 separate species of birds have been logged at Seney, including ducks, bald eagles, trumpeter swans, osprey, sandhill cranes, and common loons. On the western side of the National Wildlife Refuge, a parcel is officially designated as a wilderness with an area of 25,150 acres (102 km2). =Strangmoor Bog= The Seney NWR's western wilderness area, designated by federal law as the Seney Wilderness Area, includes the Strangmoor Bog National Natural Landmark. The Strangmoor Bog was landmarked as being the best surviving example in the 48 states of a sub-arctic patterned bog ecosystem, characterized by rapid glacial meltoff from an exposed sandy plain. The friable sand, exposed to the weather, was sculpted by wind and water into parallel strips of dune highland and wetland. History The Seney National Wildlife Refuge is built upon the remains of the Great Manistique Swamp, a perched sand wetland located in the central Upper Peninsula. After its forests were heavily exploited in 1880-1910, promoters attempted to drain the swamp for farmland. The drainage was a failure and left the wetland criss- crossed with canals, ditches, and drainage ponds. Much of the property was then abandoned for unpaid property taxes. During the 1930s, work crews employed by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) rebuilt, restored, and expanded the wetland drains, this time for active wetlands management purposes. These CCC ponds and drains are still used by the wetlands managers that staff the current National Wildlife Refuge. The Seney National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1935.Rosentreter (1986). Canada geese Canada goose When the Seney National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1935, the Canada goose was a threatened species. Widespread, year-round hunting (legal and illegal) had reduced the North American population of free-flying Canada geese to a trickle of birds who avoided human beings as much as possible. One of the priorities of the new Seney NWR was to establish a refuge for free- flying Canada geese. In January 1936, during the first winter of the Seney Refuge's operation, the refuge trucked in 300 pinioned Canada geese. These flightless geese were given a fenced-in pond area within the Refuge and were fed. It was hoped that they would produce a crop of goslings that would establish a migratory pattern of behavior and voluntarily return to the Refuge. The goslings were banded so that if they returned, the Refuge's small staff would know it. Every year a shrinking crop of Canada goslings was hatched and flew south for the winter, but few or none returned in the following spring to Seney. Poaching was apparently continuing in the geese wintering grounds and on the flyways. Meanwhile, the parent population of wing-clipped Canada geese diminished between 1936 and 1945 from 300 to 45. March, 1946 saw the first significant return of sixteen banded, free-flying Canada geese. This tiny flock bred true in the following years. The Seney Canada goose breeding population had multiplied to 3,000 birds by 1956, and continued to expand thereafter even after local hunting was re-legalized. The Seney National Wildlife Refuge's Canada goose project is considered to have been one of the key programs in re-establishing the Canada goose as a major wetland bird of North America. Today As of 2007, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, administrator of the Seney National Wildlife Refuge, was reporting that the refuge hosted approximately 88,000 visitors annually. Seney NWR acts as the administrative unit for the following other refuges: *The Huron Islands/Huron National Wildlife Refuge in Lake Superior. *The Lake Michigan division of the Michigan Islands National Wildlife Refuge. *The Whitefish Point Unit on Lake Superior in the eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where the Whitefish Point Bird Observatory conducts research on migrating birds. In 1998, the United States Coast Guard transferred from the Whitefish Point Light Station to the USFWS to form the Whitefish Point Unit of the Seney NWR.Lively (2002), pp. 10-11. The USFWS shares governance of the former light station with the Michigan Audubon Society and the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society through a Management Plan. The USFWS has final oversight at Whitefish Point.Casselman (2009), p. 7.

It had a single three-blade rotor originally powered by a 75 horsepower (56 kW) engine. The first \\"free\\" flight of the VS-300 was on 13 May 1940.Munson 1968, p. 111. The VS-300 was the first successful single lifting rotor helicopter in the United States and the first successful helicopter to use a single vertical-plane tail rotor configuration for antitorque. With floats attached, it became the first practical amphibious helicopter. Design and development Igor Sikorsky's quest for a practical helicopter began in 1938, when as the Engineering Manager of the Vought- Sikorsky Division of United Aircraft Corporation, he was able to convince the directors of United Aircraft that his years of study and research into rotary- wing flight problems would lead to a breakthrough. His first experimental machine, the VS-300, was test flown by Sikorsky on 14 September 1939, tethered by cables. In developing the concept of rotary-wing flight, Sikorsky was the first to introduce a single engine to power both the main and tail rotor systems. The only previous successful attempt at a single-lift rotor helicopter, the Yuriev-Cheremukhin TsAGI-1EA in 1931 in the Soviet Union, used a pair of uprated, Russian-built Gnome Monosoupape rotary engines of 120 hp each for its power.video.Savine, Alexandre. \\"TsAGI 1-EA\\". ctrl-c.liu.se, 24 March 1997. Retrieved 12 December 2010. For later flights of his VS-300, Sikorsky also added a vertical airfoil surface to the end of the tail to assist anti-torque but this was later removed when it proved to be ineffective. The cyclic control was found to be difficult to perfect, and led to Sikorsky locking the cyclic and adding two smaller vertical-axis lifting rotors to either side aft of the tailboom.Dorr 2005, p. 32. By varying pitch of these rotors simultaneously, fore and aft control was provided. Roll control was provided by differential pitching of the blades. In this configuration, it was found that the VS-300 could not fly forward easily and Sikorsky joked about turning the pilot's seat around.\\"A National Historic Engineering Landmark: VS-300 Helicopter (1939)\\" . Crystal City, Virginia: The American Society of Mechanical Engineers, American Helicopter Society, 17 May 1984. Operational history Sikorsky fitted utility floats (also called pontoons) to the VS-300 and performed a water landing and takeoff on 17 April 1941, making it the first practical amphibious helicopter.\\"Timeline\\". Sikorsky.com. Retrieved: 22 September 2009. On 6 May 1941, the VS-300 beat the world endurance record held by the Focke-Wulf Fw 61, by staying aloft for 1 hour 32 minutes and 26.1 seconds. The final variant of the VS-300 was powered by a 150 hp Franklin engine.Munson 1985, p. 51. The VS-300 was one of the first helicopters capable of carrying cargo. The VS-300 was modified over a two-year period, including removal of the two vertical tail rotors, until 1941, when a new cyclic control system gave it much improved flight behavior.Chiles 2008, p. 104. Surviving aircraft In 1943, the VS-300 was retired to the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan.

As a composer, he was best known for his virtuosic salon pieces for solo piano, which included a grand sonata in F minor, twelve études, and various caprices, impromptus, waltzes, and mazurkas. Life and career Schulhoff was born in Prague, where he began studying piano with Kisch and Ignaz Amadeus Tedesco and also trained in music theory with Václav Tomášek. He made his debut at Dresden in 1842 and soon afterwards appeared at the Leipzig Gewandhaus. Moving to Paris shortly afterwards, he met Frédéric Chopin, who encouraged him in his bid to become an established professional pianist. The concerts that Schulhoff gave at Chopin's suggestion were greeted with such acclaim that he embarked on a long tour through France and to London, continuing his travels through Spain (1851) and Russia (1853). After this tour he returned to Paris, where he devoted himself entirely to composition and teaching. He continued as a piano teacher when he settled in Dresden in 1870 and later moved to Berlin in 1897. He died in Berlin in 1898, aged 72.

History Stover finished in third place in the NCAA shot put competition in 1979. In 1980, while attending the University of Oregon, he was named Pac-10 champion shot putter. With record- breaking statistics, Stover made it to the 1980 Olympic trials. However, as a result of the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott by the United States (held that year in Moscow), he never had the opportunity to compete. Stover had a great eagerness to play professional football, and earned a tryout with the San Francisco 49ers shortly after they won Super Bowl XVI. He was signed by the 49ers, but played sparingly during his first few seasons. In 1984, he was named the team's starting left end, but a knee injury during the first regular season match against the Detroit Lions caused him to miss several games. In 1985, he finally played a full, healthy season in a starting role, and registered 10 sacks. In 1986, in 15 games, he registered 11 sacks. He is one of only seven 49ers defensive linemen (along with Dwaine Board, Charles Haley, Dana Stubblefield, Chris Doleman, Roy Barker, and Bryant Young) to register 10 or more sacks more than once during their tenure with the team since the statistic started being recorded in 1982... Stover remained a free agent through all of training camp and preseason in 1987 (in the midst of talk of a possible strike by the players), but signed before the season began. However, this proved to be a turning point in his career, as he in poor physical condition and posted only 3.5 sacks. In 1988, he failed to register even half a sack for the first time in his career, but still was able to play in the Super Bowl against the Cincinnati Bengals. He retired following the season and now owns the Chico Sports Club in Chico, California. He became interested in medicine and rehabilitation largely because he was plagued by injuries in his own career. Playing style Stover had more size and power than most defensive ends of his time period. Listed at 275 pounds but probably closer to 290, he was capable of simply overpowering opposing linemen. He could play defensive end in the 3-4 and defensive tackle in the 4-3, and regardless of where he played, he would simply try to run over his opponents rather than beat them with speed. In 1984, Bill Walsh called him his \\"most consistent defensive player.\\"References Other sources *Jeff Stover's Football Reference 1958 births Living people American football defensive tackles Oregon Ducks football players San Francisco 49ers players Players of American football from California Super Bowl champions ","title":"Jeff Stover"},{"id":"4009568","text":"The Banana Massacre ( or ) was a massacre of United Fruit Company workers that occurred between December 5 and 6, 1928 in the town of Ciénaga near Santa Marta, Colombia. The strike began on November 12, 1928, when the workers ceased to work until the company would reach an agreement with them to grant them dignified working conditions. After several weeks with no agreement, in which the United Fruit Company refused to negotiate with the workers, the conservative government of Miguel Abadía Méndez sent the Colombian army in against the strikers, resulting in the massacre of 100 to 2,000 people. After U.S. officials in Colombia and United Fruit representatives portrayed the workers' strike as \\"communist\\" with a \\"subversive tendency\\" in telegrams to Frank B. Kellogg, the United States Secretary of State, the United States government threatened to invade with the U.S. Marine Corps if the Colombian government did not act to protect United Fruit’s interests. The Colombian government was also compelled to work for the interests of the company, considering they could cut off trade of Colombian bananas with significant markets such as the United States and Europe. Gabriel García Márquez depicted a fictional version of the massacre in his novel One Hundred Years of Solitude, as did Álvaro Cepeda Samudio in his La Casa Grande. Although García Márquez references the number of dead as around three thousand, the actual number of dead workers is unknown. Strike The workers of the banana plantations in Colombia went on strike on November 12, 1928. The workers made nine demands from the United Fruit Company: # Stop their practice of hiring through sub-contractors # Mandatory collective insurance # Compensation for work accidents # Hygienic dormitories and 6 day work weeks # Increase in daily pay for workers who earned less than 100 pesos per month # Weekly wage # Abolition of office stores # Abolition of payment through coupons rather than money # Improvement of hospital services The strike turned into the largest labor movement ever witnessed in the country until then. Radical members of the Liberal Party, as well as members of the Socialist and Communist Parties, participated. The workers wanted to be recognized as employees, and demanded the implementation of the Colombian legal framework of the 1920s. Massacre An army regiment from Bogotá was dispatched by the government to deal with the strikers, which it deemed to be subversive. Whether these troops were sent in at the behest of the United Fruit Company did not at first clearly emerge. Three hundred soldiers were sent from Antioquia to Magdalena. There were no soldiers from Magdalena involved because General Cortes Vargas, the army- appointed military chief of the banana zone in charge of controlling the situation, did not believe they would be able to take effective actions, as they might be related to the plantation workers. The troops set up their machine guns on the roofs of the low buildings at the corners of the main square, closed off the access streets, p. 16 and, after issuing a five-minute warning that people should leave, opened fire into a dense Sunday crowd of workers and their families including children. The people had gathered after Sunday Mass to wait for an anticipated address from the governor. p. 132 Number of people dead General Cortés Vargas, who commanded the troops during the massacre, took responsibility for 47 casualties. In reality, the exact number of casualties has never been confirmed. Herrera Soto, co-author of a comprehensive and detailed study of the 1928 strike, has put together various estimates given by contemporaries and historians, ranging from 47 to as high as 2,000. According to Congressman Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, the killed strikers were thrown into the sea. Other sources claim that the bodies were buried in mass graves. Among the survivors was Luis Vicente Gámez, later a famous local figure, who survived by hiding under a bridge for three days. Every year after the massacre he delivered a memorial service over the radio. Another version by official Jose Gregorio Guerrero gave the number of dead as nine: eight civilians and one soldier. Guerrero added that Jorge Eliécer Gaitán had exaggerated the number of deaths. El Pilon: Verdades sobre la Masacre en las Bananeras The press has reported different numbers of deaths and different opinions about the events that took place that night. The conclusion is that there is no agreed-on story, but rather diverse variations depending on the source they come from. The American press provided biased information on the strike. The Colombian press was also biased depending on the political alignment of the publication. For example, the Bogotá-based newspaper El Tiempo stated that the workers were within their rights in wanting to improve their conditions. However, since the newspaper was politically conservative, they also noted that they did not agree with the strike. Official U.S. telegrams Telegram from Bogotá Embassy to the U.S. Secretary of State, Frank B. Kellogg, dated December 5, 1928, stated: Telegram from Santa Marta Consulate to the U.S. Secretary of State, dated December 6, 1928, stated: Telegram from Bogotá Embassy to the U.S. Secretary of State, dated December 7, 1928, stated: Telegram from the U.S. Department of State to Santa Marta Consulate, dated December 8, 1928, stated: Telegram from Santa Marta Consulate to the U.S. Secretary of State, dated December 9, 1928, stated: Dispatch from Santa Marta Consulate to the U.S. Secretary of State, dated December 11, 1928, stated: Dispatch from Bogotá Embassy to the U.S. Secretary of State, dated December 11, 1928, stated: Dispatch from U.S. Bogotá Embassy to the U.S. Secretary of State, dated December 29, 1928, stated: Dispatch from U.S. Bogotá Embassy to the US Secretary of State, dated January 16, 1929, stated: Consequences Guerrilla movements in Colombia such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) argued that the growth of Communism in Colombia was triggered by atrocities like these, and called it state terrorism. The Banana Massacre was one of the principal causes of the Bogotazo, and the subsequent era of violence known as La Violencia. Some sources claim there are connections between this massacre and the atrocities committed in more recent years by Chiquita Brands in Colombian territory.Glacer, Jason, director. Banana Land: Blood, Bullets and Poison. Banana Land: Blood, Bullets and Poison, 2 June 2015, bananalandmovie.org Chiquita admitted paying 1.7 million dollars to the paramilitary group AUC (United Self Defense Forces of Colombia), who have killed hundreds of Colombian citizens. This company has financed war machines by paying this terrorist group. They claimed that they had been victims of extortion and said the payments were made as a way to protect their workers from the paramilitaries, but the people seem to object. In the documentary “Banana Land” Colombian plantain workers speak up about how they feel terrorized by multinational companies like Chiquita and their work with paramilitaries. They even say that people who speak up about the way they feel are at risk of being targeted by the AUC.

Plot  Young-eon (Kim Ok- bin), the top singer at an all-girls school, is murdered by a music sheet cutting her throat in the opening scene. The next day nobody can see or hear her except her friend Seon-min (Seo Ji-hye), who can only hear her. The two attempt to find out what happened to Young-eon. Seon-min begins speculating that the music teacher must have killed Young-eon. The mystery behind her death is slowly unraveled as Young-eon has flashbacks of life before her death. Seon-min befriends a strange and lonely girl at school named Cho-ah (Cha Ye-ryun), who can hear the voices of the dead, and she helps the two solve the incident. Meanwhile, the music teacher kills herself. Seon-min begins to doubt what Young-eon says after Cho-ah tells her that ghosts only remember what they want to, meaning Young-eon's memory may be incorrect. Young-eon's body is found in on top of the elevator. Young-eon is running out of time to discover who the other ghost is; if her friend forgets about her, she will lose her voice. Some of the flashbacks include her mother, who is in a hospital. In one flashback, she talks to her mother about how she will learn to drive when she is old enough. Another features how her mother committed suicide by jumping off the top of the hospital. In the end, Young-eon is revealed to have driven her mother to suicide, and might have multiple personality disorder due to the trauma and guilt of encouraging her mother to kill herself. Young-eon brings tears to her music teacher's eyes when she asks the teacher to sing, leading the latter to contemplate suicide. It turns out that Young-eon had been hearing the voices of her teacher and of the ghost, Hyo-jung, the whole time. Young-eon wanted the teacher dead to get rid of Hyo- jung's voice. Hyo-jung was a student and top singer at the school who fell in love with the music teacher. She has the same voice as Young-eon and they are both recorded in a song. Hyo-jung is revealed to have shot the music sheet at Young-eon's throat in the opening scene out of anger at losing her voice. Seon-min thinks Young-eon should move on but Young-eon is angered by her statement, since she wants nothing more than to live again. Young-eon kills Cho-ah and takes over Seon-min's body. She then walks alongside Seon-min's mother, talking about how, as soon as she is old enough, she will learn to drive. A scene during the credits shows Cho-ah shouting in frustration, but voiceless.

The organization was founded in 1946, and merged with International House in 1968, when it was renamed to World Trade Center New Orleans. The original International Trade Mart building (since demolished), corner of Camp & Common Streets in New Orleans. 2 Canal Street, the former headquarters of the World Trade Center New Orleans, successor organization of the ITM, designed by Edward Durell Stone. After World War II, New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw returned to New Orleans where he became a founder of the International Trade Mart (ITM). From 1947 to his retirement in 1965, Shaw ran the ITM as a managing director. The International Trade Mart was chartered in 1945, first opened in 1948, and in 1968, merged with International House to form the World Trade Center New Orleans (WTCNO), a private, non-profit organization with a membership of 2,000 corporations and individuals dedicated to improving international trade with New Orleans. Like its predecessor organizations, the WTCNO continues to sponsor trade missions to Latin American and Caribbean nations to conduct a variety of educational programs, conferences, seminars, and trade shows and to host dignitaries and other visitors from New Orleans' trade partner nations. In 1968, the WTCNO moved into a purpose-built 33-story building at 2 Canal Street, designed by architect Edward Durell Stone. The building overlooks the Mississippi River and the French Quarter. After Hurricane Katrina, the building was unoccupied, and in 2012 it was purchased from the WTCNO by the City of New Orleans. In 2018, the city announced that the building would be redeveloped into a hotel and apartment complex, set to open in 2021. The World Trade Center New Orleans organization has offices in a nearby building, One Canal Place. Trade expansionists advanced their cause further by forming the International Trade Mart (ITM). They intended that International House and ITM would complement each other and together would form the international program's foundation. The mart satisfied a longstanding ambition for an institution that could exhibit commodities and could provide a setting where buyer and seller could meet easily in New Orleans. Since the city lacked a manufacturing base, buyers from, say, Mexico might—absent a mart in New Orleans—travel to, say, Toledo to purchase steel or glass. The resulting trade might well bypass New Orleans. But the mart, thought trade expansionists, would maximize the port's chances of handling this trade.  References  Bibliography * Arthur E.

He was an advocate of Indian removal from the eastern United States, proposing an Indian state in what is now Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. He also played an instrumental role in the founding of Grand Rapids, Michigan and Kansas City, Missouri. Early life McCoy was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, in 1784. Five years later, the McCoy family rafted down the Ohio River to Kentucky, settling first near Louisville and in 1792 in Shelby County. The senior McCoy was a Baptist minister, and he and his son had profound arguments on religion. (The elder McCoy, on theological principles shared by many of his congregation, was opposed to evangelizing.) While still young, Isaac was inspired to become a missionary to Native Americans and determined on that work. =Marriage and family= In 1804 at the age of 20, Isaac McCoy married Christiana Polke (1778–1851), age 16, in Kentucky; she was a cousin of the future President James K. Polk. Christiana's family had been at Kincheloe's Station, Nelson County, Kentucky, when it was attacked. Her mother and four siblings were carried into captivity by the Shawnee and Christiana was born after that time. They were taken to Michigan, where they lived with the Indians for 13 months. They were eventually \\"bought\\" or ransomed by the British, who sent them south to return to their people in Kentucky. The McCoys had 14 children; only four survived to adulthood. John Calvin McCoy assisted his father and became prominent in his own right in the early history of the Kansas and Missouri frontiers.\\"Sixth Biennial Report,\\" Kansas State Historical Society, 1889, pp. 298-311 McCoy's wife, Christiana, died in Kansas City in 1851.

Bradley Publishing, Inc., 1997 and a lake in Cass County, Michigan are named for her.\\"Christiana Polke McCoy\\", Polke Papers, Cartar, accessed 28 April 2012 Westward migration Soon after their marriage, the young couple departed Kentucky for Vincennes, Indiana. Although he had no training and no formal education, McCoy became a part-time preacher. In 1808 the Silver Creek Baptist Church, the first Baptist Church in Indiana, granted McCoy a license \\"to preach the Gospel wherever God in His providence might cast his lot.\\" The Silver Creek church was located near what became Sellersburg in Clark County. In 1809 McCoy became pastor of Maria Creek Church near Vincennes and in 1810 the Church ordained him as a minister. He also spent time serving as the town jailor at Vincennes. Despite illness and poverty, McCoy traveled widely (if unsuccessfully) on the frontier promoting the Baptist church. In 1817, the Baptist Board of Foreign Missions appointed him as a missionary to the settlers and Indians in Indiana and Illinois territories. Though his original intention was to preach to frontiersmen, his interests and concern for Indians quickly began to dominate his work.Schultz, George A. An Indian Canaan: Isaac McCoy and the Vision of an Indian State. Norman: U of OK Press, 1971, pp. 4-15 Isaac McCoy at age 47 Missions in Indiana and Michigan McCoy founded his first \\"religious station\\" and school in October 1818 in what became Parke County, Indiana, on Big Raccoon Creek upstream from the later Wea Indian reservation at Armiesburg.Schultz, p. 28 The mission was said to be situated between Rosedale and Bridgeton. The Wea showed little interest in the school, however, and it failed. McCoy at that time was likely the only white settler in Parke County. In February 1819, he performed the first marriage in the county, between two métis, Christmas Dazney (Noel Dagenet) and Mary Ann Isaacs (a Brotherton or Mohegan from upstate New York). In 1821, in compensation for his work with McCoy and for the federal government as an interpreter, Dazney filed a land claim between the mouths of Sugar Creek and Big Raccoon Creek north and east of present-day Montezuma and established a Wea-Miami reservation there. This was the first reservation that came about as a result of a connection with Isaac McCoy, though McCoy had left the area by then. Dazney was eventually instrumental in leading bands of Indiana Indians west to Kansas after the Indian Removal Act of 1830. Dazney died in Kansas in 1848. In May 1820, the McCoy family moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana to set up a mission to the Miami tribe. His school at Fort Wayne attracted 40 Miami, Potawatomi, and mixed-blood children, several whites, and one African American. The Miami and Potawatomi tribes at this time consisted of mixed-race people and there were no clear lines of distinction between races within the tribes. In 1821, McCoy made the first of many visits to Washington, DC, seeking approval by the federal government, unsuccessfully on this occasion, for him to appoint teachers, blacksmiths, and other \\"agents of civilization\\" to be provided the Indians under newly ratified treaties.Schultz, pp 56-58 In 1821 Chief Little Turtle of the Miamis, along with 16 other Indians and the captive William Wells, also made a trip to Washington, DC. It was Little Turtle's second visit to a President. The trip resulted in a government-funded Quaker agricultural mission to the Miamis. In December 1822, McCoy left Fort Wayne and moved his family and 18 Indian students to a site on the St. Joseph River near the present-day city of Niles in southwestern Michigan; he opened a mission to the Pottawatomi. The Carey Mission, as it came to be known, was 100 miles from the nearest White settlement. The Pottawatomi gave McCoy a relatively warm welcome and helped feed his large family and Indian students through their early seasons in the territory. McCoy enjoyed more success here than in his earlier endeavors. His school expanded to have 76 Indian children, four Indian employees, five missionaries, six white children, and a millwright. In 1826, McCoy led his family in another move, deeper into the frontier, where he established the Thomas Mission to the Odawa people, at what was later to become Grand Rapids, Michigan. McCoy and his missionaries were the first European-American settlers in Niles and Grand Rapids. Indian removal McCoy began in 1823 to advocate that the Indian nations of the East be moved west \\"beyond the frontiers of the White settlement.\\" He believed that getting the tribes to their own, isolated places, away from the reach of whiskey traders and others who were exploiting them, would give them a better chance of surviving and becoming Christianized. McCoy's ideas for removal of the Indians were not new, but he promoted the idea that the U.S. government should fund \\"civilization programs\\" to educate the Indians and turn them into farmers and Christians.Schultz, pp. 67-70 McCoy expanded his concept later to propose the creation of an Indian state making up most of the land area of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Nebraska. Although McCoy thought of himself as the future leader of Indian Canaan (as he called it) he had little confidence in his fellow missionaries. They never accomplished more than 'to soften the pillows of the dying' and had \\"too recently been transplanted from the sterile plains of religious bigotry, to expand with liberal views of the character, and of the just rights of man.\\" Rather he placed his faith in the government to create for the Indians \\"a country of their own\\" where they could \\"feel their importance, where they can hope to enjoy, unmolested, the fruits of their labours, and their national recovery need not be doubted.\\" His proposed Indian colony, to become subsequently a Territory and then a State within the United States, would be guided by a benign U.S. government and missionaries with whiskey dealers and dishonest merchants banned. What McCoy failed to foresee was that the frontier of white settlement was expanding so rapidly that his Indian Canaan would be overrun by settlers before Indians could enjoy \\"unmolested, the fruits of their labours.\\"Schultz, 95-96 Moreover, he overestimated the good will and capacity of the government. During the tragic removals forced on the Indians by the U.S. government in the 1830s and later, thousands would die of neglect and arrive in Kansas and Oklahoma impoverished and starving. McCoy's conversion programs and philosophy of removal, though well-intentioned, culminated in the 1838 Potawatomi Trail of Death. Surveyor of Indian Territory The possibility of removing eastern Indians west of the Mississippi River was enhanced In 1825 when the Osage and the Kaw ceded large portions of their lands in Kansas and Oklahoma to the United States. In 1828, Congress authorized McCoy to lead an expedition to survey lands to which the Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Creek of the Southeast could be relocated. McCoy also invited representatives of the Potawatomi and Odawa to join the expedition. With the unenthusiastic Indians, McCoy traveled through Kansas and Oklahoma laying out potential reservations and devising in his mind the organization of an Indian State.Schultz, pp. 101-116 In June 1829, McCoy moved his family to Fayette, Missouri. That fall, at his own expense, he carried out a survey on the Kaw lands. In 1830, with Kaw \\"mixed blood\\" Joseph James as his guide he surveyed and established the boundaries of a reservation for the Delaware tribe who were persuaded to move there from their territories in southern Missouri. In 1830, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, which formally authorized the removal of eastern Indians to the West. For the next ten years, McCoy was engaged in surveying boundaries of reservations for more than twenty tribes who moved west to present-day Kansas. Often they comprised small remnants of formerly powerful peoples.\\"Kansas Indian Tribes\\", from John R. Swanton, The Indian Tribes of North America, Bureau of American Ethnology, Bulletin 145, Washington DC: US Government Printing Office, 1953, reproduced at Access Genealogy, accessed February 21, 2011 McCoy had hoped to be one of the three commissioners appointed to oversee Indian Territory, but he was passed over and his dreams of becoming the government's chief representative to the Indian tribes were dashed.Schultz, 139-140 Aware of the fraud, abuse, and neglect involved in the removal of Indians westward, McCoy rationalized that it was for the greater good of having Indian lands secured for them in perpetuity. Such \\"perpetuity\\" was to last little more than two decades.Schultz, p. 141 Missionary work in the 1830s McCoy, his son John, his daughter Delilah and her missionary husband Johnston Lykins, worked together as missionaries to the Shawnee and Lenape (Delaware), following them to what is now Kansas City, Missouri, on the border of Indian Territory and near their reservations. The younger McCoy established a trading post at Westport, Missouri. He was among the first organizers of Kansas City. His brother-in-law Lykins was elected as one of the city's first mayors. McCoy's strong views were often at odds with the Baptist mission board and other missionaries. In 1832, a smallpox epidemic was killing thousands of Indians. McCoy traveled to Washington, seeking funds from Congress to support a vaccination program for Indians. He found little enthusiasm for such a bill. The Missouri Senator, Alexander Buckner, said to him about the Indians, \\"if they were all dead it would be a blessing for our country.\\" Partially due to his efforts, Congress eventually passed a modest bill to finance Indian vaccinations. In 1833, an armed McCoy was involved with a company of \\"ruffians,\\" a mob in Independence, Missouri who attacked Mormon families at gunpoint and expelled them from their homes onto the prairie, where they nearly starved.Schultz, 153-162 The autobiography of Parley Pratt recalls: \\"While we thus made our escape the companies of ruffians were ranging in every direction; bursting into homes without fear, knowing that the people [the Mormons] were disarmed; frightening women and children, and threatening to kill them if they did not flee immediately. At the head of one of these parties appeared the Rev. Isaac McCoy (a noted Baptist missionary to the Indians), with gun in hand, ordering the people to leave their homes immediately and surrender everything in the shape of arms. Other pretended preachers of the Gospel took part in the persecution—speaking of the [Mormon] Church as the common enemies of mankind, and exulting in their afflictions.\\" Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt p. 108 Edward Partridge recalled the same incident in a letter of 1839, when the Mormons were disarmed at Independence: \\"Wednesday Nov 6th. The arms being taken from the Saints the mob now felt safe and were no longer militia. They formed themselves into companies and went forth on horseback armed to harass the saints and pick up all the arms they could find. Two of these companies were headed by Baptist priests. The Rev. Isaac McCoy headed one of about 60 or 70, the other's was about 30 or 40. They went through the different settlement[s] of the Saints threatening them with death and destruction if they were not off immediately... The mobs whipped and shot at some and others they hunted, for as they said to kill them. Such mobs well lined with whiskey were acting worse than savages.\\"\\"Edward Partridge, History, Manuscript, Circa 1839.\\" Although he was involved in numerous projects on behalf of what he perceived as the best interest of Indians, McCoy was nearly destitute during much of the 1830s, taking in boarders and working as bookkeeper in a neighboring store. He hoped to be appointed as the government overseer of Indians. He lobbied in Washington and on the frontier seeking, unsuccessfully, for U.S. government recognition of the Indian lands as an official U.S. Territory.Schultz, 173-181 While in Missouri, a slave state, in 1835 McCoy purchased a female slave named Chainy. Opposed to slavery, he said that he had bought her to prevent her being separated from her husband and children by being sold through a slave market. (It appears he already owned her husband and children.) In his will he provided for her to be manumitted, on the condition that she pay his estate (or descendants) her purchase price of $415 plus interest. He also provided for her children (also his property) to be freed when each reached age 24.\\"Will of Isaac McCoy.\\" http://old/genquest.com/isaacmccoy.htm, accessed February 19, 2011 In 1840, McCoy wrote one of the earliest, most personally informed reports on the Midwestern Native American tribes, The History of Baptist Indian Missions. In 1842 he returned East to Louisville, Kentucky, where he directed the Baptist American Indian Mission Association. He wrote additional works on Indians and the missions. He died there in 1846 and was buried in Western Cemetery.\\"Isaac McCoy\\", Oklahoma Encyclopedia of Culture and History, accessed February 19, 2011 Assessment McCoy was much more of a social reformer than a missionary, hardly being concerned in his later years with converting Indians to Christianity. He \\"attacked the system of law and custom by which Indians had been kept in bondage\\" and \\"his object was to free the Indians from those restraints.\\" His solution was to move the Indians beyond where they could be corrupted and exploited by Whites. But the tide of westward expansion in the U.S. was too strong and his plans failed. Still, the vision of this rude, untutored preacher and pioneer was, in the words of his biographer, 'somewhat breathtaking.\\"Schultz, pp. 198-203 References Further reading  * External links *The Isaac McCoy Papers at The Kansas Historical Society * 1784 births 1846 deaths People from Uniontown, Pennsylvania American city founders People from the Kansas City metropolitan area People from Grand Rapids, Michigan People from Louisville, Kentucky United States Indian agents People from Vincennes, Indiana Critics of Mormonism People from Fayette, Missouri Baptist missionaries in the United States ","title":"Isaac McCoy"},{"id":"4009699","text":"Purdue University College of Technology Kokomo was co-located on the Indiana University Kokomo campus, in Kokomo, Indiana.

Life Cottam was born to Protestant parents, Laurence Cottam of Dilworth and Anne Brewer, but was converted as an adult to Catholicism by Thomas Pound. He studied at Brasenose College, Oxford, and received his M.A. on 14 July 1572, before leaving for London, where he became master of a grammar school. It was there that he met Pound and decided to head to Douai to become a priest. He was ordained a deacon at Cambrai in December 1577 and, desiring to become a missionary to India, went to Rome and was received as a Jesuit novice at Sant' Andrea on 8 April 1579. That October he came down with a fever and was sent to Lyons to recuperate. The spy Sledd had been in Rome, and traveling with some Englishmen arrived in Lyon, where he made the acquaintance of Cottam. Discovering that Cottam intended to proceed to England, he made careful note of Cottams's appearance and particulars and continuing on to Paris passed the information to the English ambassador.Challoner, Richard. Memoirs of Missionary Priests, Thomas Richardson & son, 1843, p. 121 From there he went to the English College, Rheims, considering himself accepted for India, if his health improved after a visit to England. He was ordained around 28 May 1580, at Soissons and left on 5 June with four companions for England. Betrayed by Sledd, he was immediately arrested at Dover. Through a ruse by Dr. Ely, one of his fellow-travellers, Cottam reached London safely; however, the good deed put the doctor at risk, and Cottam voluntarily surrendered himself. He was initially committed \\"close prisoner\\" to the Marshalsea, where it is thought he said his first Mass.

This condition is due to mitochondrial dysfunction mediating the death of optic nerve fibers. Dominant optic atrophy was first described clinically by Batten in 1896 and named Kjer’s optic neuropathy in 1959 after Danish ophthalmologist Poul Kjer, who studied 19 families with the disease. Although dominant optic atrophy is the most common autosomally inherited optic neuropathy (i.e., disease of the optic nerves) aside from glaucoma, it is often misdiagnosed.  Presentation  Autosomal dominant optic atrophy can present clinically as an isolated bilateral optic neuropathy (non-syndromic form) or rather as a complicated phenotype with extra-ocular signs (syndromic form). Dominant optic atrophy usually affects both eyes roughly symmetrically in a slowly progressive pattern of vision loss beginning in childhood and is hence a contributor to childhood blindness. Vision testing will reveal scotomas (areas of impaired visual acuity) in the central visual fields with peripheral vision sparing and impaired color vision (color blindness). Visual acuity loss varies from mild to severe, typically ranging from 6/6 (in meters, equivalent to 20/20, ft) to 6/60 (20/200, ft) with a median value of 6/36 (roughly equivalent to 20/125 ft), corrected vision. In rare cases, vision loss is more severe. Characteristic changes of the fundus evident on examination is temporal pallor (indicating atrophy) of the optic disc and in its end stage, excavation of the optic disc, as is also seen in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and normal tension glaucoma. Because the onset of Dominant optic atrophy is insidious, symptoms are often not noticed by the patients in its early stages and are picked up by chance in routine school eye screenings. First signs of Kjer's typically present between 4–6 years of age, though presentation at as early as 1 year of age has been reported. In some cases, Dominant optic atrophy may remain subclinical until early adulthood. Progression of dominant optic atrophy varies even within the same family. Some have mild cases with visual acuity stabilizing in adolescence, others have slowly but constantly progressing cases, and others still have sudden step-like decreases in visual acuity. Generally, the severity of the condition by adolescence reflects the overall level of visual function to be expected throughout most of the patient’s adult life (Votruba, 1998). Slow decline in acuity is known to occur in late middle age in some families. In complicated cases of autosomal dominant optic atrophy, in addition to bilateral optic neuropathy, several other neurological signs of neurological involvement can be observed: peripheral neuropathy, deafness, cerebellar ataxia, spastic paraparesis, myopathy.  Genetics Dominant optic atrophy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. That is, a heterozygous patient with the disease has a 50% chance of passing on the disease to offspring, assuming his/her partner does not have the disease. Males and females are affected at the same rate. Although Kjer's has a high penetrance (98%), severity and progression of DOA are extremely variable even within the same family.  Pathophysiology  Vision loss in dominant optic atrophy is due to optic nerve fiber loss from mitochondria dysfunction. Dominant optic atrophy is associated with mutation of the OPA1 gene found on chromosome 3, region q28-qter. Also, 5 other chromosomal genes are described as causing optic atrophy: OPA2 (x-linked), OPA3 (dominant), OPA4 (dominant), OPA5 (dominant) and OPA6 (recessive) (see OMIM 165500). The OPA1 gene codes for a dynamin-related GTPase protein targeted to the mitochondrial inner membrane. OPA1 has distinct roles in the fusion of mitochondrial inner membranes during mitochondrial fusion events, and in regulation of cell death. Mitochondria are subcellular structures that generate and transform energy from metabolism into discrete usable units (ATP) for the cell’s functions (See oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport chain). Retinal ganglion cells (neurons), which make up the optic nerve, have a high energy demand and are particularly sensitive to mitochondrial dysfunction. This is especially the case for smaller and less myelinated neurons such as those found in the papillomacular bundle of the retina, which transmit information corresponding to the central visual field. Biochemical and mitochondrial morphological studies on cells from patients affected by autosomal dominant optic atrophy have shown a severe defect in the shape (with a very remarkable fragmentation of the mitochondrial tubules in small spheres) and distribution of mitochondria, occurring independently from a bioenergetic defect (respiratory chain function, ATP synthesis, and reactive oxygen species production) or apoptosis, indicating that the mitochondrial fusion defect is the primary pathogenetic mechanism, although variable bioenergetic defects can also occur as a secondary phenomenon, especially in severe cases with complicated phenotypes and accumulation of multiple mitochondrial-DNA deletions. Over 60 different mutations of the OPA1 gene causing Kjer's have been reported, most of which occur in the catalytic domain of the protein. Mutations at the OPA1 gene are also associated with normal tension glaucoma (OMIM 606657) and deafness (OMIM 125250).  Management  Currently there is no effective therapy for dominant optic atrophy, and consequently, these patients are simply monitored for changes in vision by their eye-care professional. Children of patients should be screened regularly for visual changes related to dominant optic atrophy. Research is underway to further characterize the disease so that therapies may be developed. Since November 2018, Cure ADOA Foundation has been focusing on fellow patients and their families. They have the following goals: scientific research, disease awareness, interaction between all parties involved and a trustworthy place for the patients. Incidence  The incidence of dominant optic atrophy has been estimated to be 1:50000 with prevalence as high as 1:10000 in the Danish population (Votruba, 1998).

Biography Moses was born in Strand in Rogaland county, Norway in 1885. He was the son of Reverend Henrik B. and Isabella (Eckersberg) Moses. He attended public school in Norway, and graduated from the high school at Kongsvinger in 1900 and from junior college in Oslo in 1903. He came to the United States in 1905 and worked for the Great Northern Railway from 1906 to 1911. He entered the University of North Dakota in 1912, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1914. He entered the University of North Dakota Law School and graduated with a Juris Doctor degree in 1915. He began practicing law at Hazen, North Dakota in 1917. He was married to Ethel Joslyn and had four children. Political career From 1919 until 1923, and later from 1927 until 1933, Moses served as State's Attorney for Mercer County. In 1936 he came in third in the three-way governor's race, behind former governors William Langer and Walter Welford. Moses became governor in 1939, following William Langer's second term in the office. Moses worked hard to reduce Langer's influence. He sought to cut government spending and to balance the state's budget. Moses was in office during World War II. He tried to encourage war-time industries to locate in the state, but North Dakota ranked last in the nation for receiving war spending. Despite the lack of wartime appropriations, Moses' administration was a time of prosperity for the state. Rainfall was plentiful and there was a ready market for agriculture products. Moses was a popular governor. During his election campaign he gave speeches in English, German, or Norwegian, depending on his audience. A Democrat, Moses was noted for his support from both political parties. In 1944 Moses defeated Gerald P. Nye for a seat in the United States Senate. Death Moses died on March 3, 1945, shortly after taking his place in the Senate. He is buried in St. Mary's Cemetery, Bismarck, North Dakota.

He held a Royal Warrant as organ builder to HM Queen Elizabeth. Biography Drake was born 1947 in Baltimore, Maryland to an English father and mother of Swiss-American citizenship. Returning to England in 1952 on the death of his father he was educated at Dartington College of Arts where he learned the organ under John Wellingham. He was inspired to become an organ builder following a visit as a teenager to the exhibition of newly built organs at St Albans International Organ Festival at St Albans Abbey. After completing an apprenticeship in Austria with Rieger Orgelbau he worked with Rudolf Janke in Göttingen. He built a small award-winning organ as his Meisterstuck in the workshop of Patrick Collon in Brussels. Drake established the firm of William Drake Ltd in 1974 in Buckfastleigh, Devon. The company was part of the John Loosemore Centre for Organ and Early Music - an entity that taught a number of subjects concerning the organ - such as playing of the organ, history, and organ-building. Eventually that program was discontinued, but Drake's organ- building firm continued in the premises. William Drake Ltd has built new organs and restored instruments in a number of countries, including New Zealand and the United States. For the design of instruments, the firm takes its inspiration from English organs of the 18th and 19th centuries. Organs built by Drake's company are mechanical action instruments and restorations adhere to high standards of historical accuracy. William Drake died on 11 January 2014, aged 70.

Early life O'Rourke was born October 26, 1876 in Basin, Minsk, Russian Empire (modern Belarus), to an aristocratic family of Irish ancestry, many of them high officers in the Russian military. The most prominent was Joseph Cornelius O'Rourke. They held imperial titles of the Russian Empire and of the German Holy Roman Empire, but also had petitioned to retain the Irish count title as well, which was granted by the Tsar in 1848. His father was Michael Graf O'Rourke and his mother Baltic-German Angelika von Bochwitz. He received a broad European education and learned a number of languages. After graduating in 1898 from the famous Jesuit School in Chyrów, then in Galicia, Austria- Hungary, now in Ukraine, he went to Riga, Latvia to study. In 1903 he graduated from the Trade and Mechanics Faculty of the University of Riga. In 1903 he moved to Freiburg, Switzerland, where he continued his studies at the University of Fribourg, faculty of law. The following year O'Rourke moved to the theological faculty at the University of Innsbruck in Austria-Hungary. On October 27, 1908 he was ordained priest in Wilno, now in Lithuania. He became a professor of ecclesiastical history, German and French at the Seminary of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Minsk-Mohilev in Saint Petersburg. Between 1912 and 1915, he was parish priest of the multilingual congregation of St. Stanislaus in Petersburg.kirchenlexikon.de After the February Revolution in Russia, the church decided to re-establish the diocese of Minsk; O'Rourke was appointed as its administrator and the interim head of the Catholic Church in Russia. He met Achille Ratti for the first time, the Apostolic Visitor for the Baltic Countries and later Pope Pius XI. Due to the proposed independence of Latvia, in 1918 the diocese of Riga was established. O'Rourke was appointed bishop of Riga on the recommendation of Ratti on 29 September 1918. O'Rourke's position in Riga was problematic as German forces occupied the city in early 1919. By the end of World War I, the ecclesiastical organisation was largely destroyed, and only a few priests remained. O'Rourke did not speak Latvian but tried to encourage Latvian priests. He resigned after a new government in Latvia was appointed and there was a popular movement calling for an ethnic Latvian bishop. He was released from Riga in April 1920 and named titular bishop of Canea He was appointed Apostolic Delegate for the Baltic States. In November 1921 he was also appointed the Pontifical Delegate for Russian refugees in Danzig and East Prussia, and in 1928 for Catholic Russians in Germany. Free City of Danzig The Free City of Danzig was split from Germany in 1920. On April 24, 1922 Achille Ratti, then Pope Pius XI, nominated O'Rourke to the post of an Apostolic Administrator of the Free City of Danzig, and, on 21 December 1922, as the titular bishop of Pergamon. After the creation of the Diocese of Danzig on December 30, 1925, O'Rourke was appointed as the first Bishop of Danzig. He initially established good relations with the authorities (who granted him citizenship on 12 June 1926) and the mostly Protestant population. After the Nazis took over the area in 1933, he came into conflict with them over their policies.Stefan Samerski: Das Bistum Danzig in Lebensbildern He hosted a synod from 10 to 12 December 1935, but growing pressure from the Nazi-majority senate made him resign as bishop of Danzig after he had tried to appoint four additional Polish parish priests. On 13 June 1938 he was appointed Titular bishop of Sophene. He adopted Polish citizenship in December 1938 and was made Cathedral Canon in Gniezno/Poznań. When the Germans attacked Poland in September 1939, O'Rourke was on a journey to Estonia. He traveled via Warsaw and Königsberg to Berlin, where he applied for a Visa to Italy.Samerski, Ein aussichtsloses Unternehmen After going to Rome, O'Rourke tried to return to his Diocese in Poznań, but his visa application was rejected by the Germans. O'Rourke died in Rome on June 27, 1943. His successor as Bishop of Danzig (and later Gdańsk) was Carl Maria Splett. In 1972 O'Rourke's ashes were moved from Campo Verano to his former bishopric, now in Poland; they were buried in a crypt in the Oliwa Cathedral.

In passenger aircraft, aircraft seat maps and seats were designated by row number followed by column letter. For wide bodied jets, the seats can be 10 across, labeled ABC-DEFG-HJK. The letter I is skipped to avoid mistaking it as row number 1. In Vehicle Identification Number used by motor vehicle manufacturers, the letters I, O and Q are omitted for their similarity to 1 or 0.

Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 138. He attended the public schools and the academy at Mount Pleasant, Iowa. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1853 and began practicing law. He was married to Margaretta T. Bowen. Career Bowen moved to Wayne County, Iowa, in 1856 and was a member of the Iowa House of Representatives that year. In 1858, he moved to Kansas. During the American Civil War, Bowen served in the Union Army. On June 11, 1861, he was appointed captain of the 1st Nebraska Infantry Regiment, later redesignated 1st Nebraska Cavalry Regiment. He resigned from the volunteers on February 5, 1862.

Bowen was appointed colonel of the 13th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Infantry, September 20, 1862. Bowen was temporary commander of brigades in the Department of the Missouri and the Department of Arkansas from October 1862 to March 21, 1864. He commanded Brigade 1, Division 1, VII Corps (Union Army) in the Department of Arkansas from March 22, 1865 to June 24, 1865.

It first appeared on Bob Marley and the Wailers' 1976 Island Records album, Rastaman Vibration, Marley's only top 10 album in the USA. (In UK it reached position 15 May 15, 1976.) The lyrics are almost entirely derived from a speech made by Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I before the United Nations General Assembly on 4 October 1963. Songwriting controversy \\"War\\" is credited to Allen \\"Skill\\" Cole (idea) and Carlton Barrett (music); the music was an extension of the one-drop drumming style, which Carlton Barrett had developed and refined, if not invented. The lyrics are a near-exact repetition of a speech in the UN by the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie. However, the two simple guitar chords and the semi-improvised, spirited melody put to Selassie's words is unmistakably Marley's. According to Stephen Davis' biography \\"Bob Marley,\\" it also appears that Marley had credited several of his multi-million selling 1974-1976 songs to close friends and relatives because he was under an unfavorable publishing contract, signed in April 1968 with Cayman Publishing, that would have otherwise deprived him of much of his songwriting royalties. Crediting close friends, such as football player Allan \\"Skill\\" Cole or Wailers drummer Carlton \\"Carly\\" Barrett therefore enabled Bob Marley to circumvent the law until new, more favorable agreements were made. This practice, along with the practice of rewarding friends who contributed to compositions by crediting them — even if they only contributed with ideas — and Marley's sudden death without leaving a will all combined to create confusion about the copyright status of several songs, including \\"War\\". Barrett's brother, Wailer musician Aston \\"Family Man\\" Barrett (who created the bass line, key to the song's efficiency) has since brought lawsuits against the Marley estate (in practice, the widow Rita Marley) for unpaid royalties and credit for songs such as \\"War\\" that were claimed to have been either written by others and not by Bob Marley, or in collaboration with Marley.Miller, Mark and Blum, Bruno, Sur la route avec Bob Marley, page 97. Scali, France, 2007. One such suit reached a settlement in 1994 in which Barrett was paid $500,000. Barrett later continued to pursue legal action, seeking £60 million ($113.6 million at the time) in a suit against the Island-Universal record label and the Marley family, but the case was dismissed on the grounds that the earlier settlement proscribed any further claim on the estate Bob Marley was a talented songwriter, but during the ska-, rocksteady- and the primitive reggae era, only Peter Tosh could play the guitar in The Wailers. Carlton Barrett was considered the most promising young reggae drummer in Jamaica when he belonged to Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry's studio band The Upsetters, and when Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer broke with Perry in 1972, they took the Barrett brothers with them. The Barrett Brothers have a very large part in the development of Bob Marley's special sound, that does not sound like other reggae music. When Tosh and Wailer left in 1973, it was Aston Barrett's idea to rearrange the band's music room, to create a rehearsal room, and set it up like a little demo studio to tape the new concept of lyrics, melodies, and music. Bob Marley and the Wailers started to prepare themselves much better musically before they were ready to go into the studio. The first work was the album called Natty Dread 1974 (where \\"No Woman No Cry\\" and \\"Rebel Music\\" can be found, and the second album was Rastaman Vibration with the songs \\"War\\" and \\"Want More\\" (Aston Barrett).Obrecht, Jas (2011) \\"Aston \\"Family Man\\" Barrett: A New Interview About Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and The Wailers\\" Jas Obrecht Music Archive, 14 feb 2011. After Marley's death, it was not easy to determine who did what in creating music. The songs grew naturally through rehearsals, etc., but when it came to Bob Marley and the Wailers, the band members were convinced that they were led by a prophet who inspired them all. Bob Marley was extremely charismatic, and after his death in 1981 many of the band members had difficulties making a living, sometimes due to depression and personal crises. The royalty battles are really deeply tragic, but the situation has improved in many ways since Marley's sons David (Ziggy) and Stephen took over the heritage, the copyrights and the responsibility. Background As taught by the Original Gong, Leonard P Howell, Marley, along with fellow Rastafari, worship Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia as the incarnation of God, and refer to him as \\"Ras Tafari,\\" \\"Jah\\" or \\"The Lion of Judah\\" which Marley does in many of his songs. To him, Haile Selassie was not only one of the most prominent African leaders of his time, he was also identified as God returning to earth as \\"King of Kings, Lord of Lords\\" (Revelation 19, 16), imperial titles born both by Haile Selassie and Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II before him. It was Menelik II, who created this self-styled imperial title in the late 19th century after he succeeded in uniting Ethiopia. Marley did however accept Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity eight months before his death. Haile Selassie gave the \\"War\\" speech on October 4, 1963, calling for world peace at the 1963 U.N. General Assembly in New York City. This historical speech was spoken a few weeks after the Organization of African Unity (OAU) was founded in Ethiopian capital city Addis Ababa, where Haile Selassie chaired a summit meeting gathering almost every African head of state (The King of Morocco had declined the invitation). This U.N. speech resounded even louder as Haile Selassie had made a name for himself on the international scene in 1936, when he spoke at The League of Nations in Geneva. There, Haile Selassie warned the world that if the members of the League did not fulfill their obligation to militarily assist Ethiopia against the invasion by fascist Italy, the League would then cease to exist as a matter of fact and the rest of the member states were to suffer the same fate as his country. Three years later World War II broke out. This visionary speech granted Haile Selassie much respect around the world, eventually leading to British military support, which helped freeing his country in 1941. Addressing the world again in 1963, Haile Selassie's words bore full weight. In picking this utterance for lyrics, Bob Marley thus projected two dimensions of the Ethiopian Emperor: the head of state as well as the Living God Rastafarian saw him as. Lyrics Although credited to Emperor Haile Selassie I, whose Christian name is Tafari Makonen, the real author of the text remains uncertain . It is sometimes believed that it was written by Lorenzo Tazaz, a close contributor who wrote many of the Ethiopian leader's most important speeches, including a historic one given in 1935 to the League of Nations. But Tazaz died in 1947, over fifteen years before the 1963 U.N. utterance. Spoken in Ethiopia's official Amharic language at the U.N., the 1963 speech was published in English in Important Utterances of H.I.M. Emperor Haile Selassie I 1963-1972.Important Utterances of H.I.M. Emperor Haile Selassie I 1963-1972, The Imperial Ethiopian Ministry of Information, Addis Ababa, 1972 The book gave permission to freely use its contents: \\"Any portion of this book could be reproduced by any process without permission.\\" The song uses part of Selassie's speech that calls for equality among all without regard to race, class, or nationality in his hymnal cry for peace. It also asserts, quoting Selassie directly, that until the day of an equal society, there will be war. In the original speech, Selassie urged U.N. officials and country representatives to disarm nuclear weapons, and to end international exploitation (specifically with Africa). The song honors Haile Selassie I while calling for action against racial inequality and international injustice. The part of the speech used by Bob Marley was preceded by the following words: > Last May, in Addis Ababa, I convened a meeting of Heads of African States > and Governments. In three days, the thirty-two nations represented at that > Conference demonstrated to the world that when the will and the > determination exist, nations and peoples of diverse backgrounds can and will > work together. In unity, to the achievement of common goals and the > assurance of that equality and brotherhood which we desire. On the question > of racial discrimination, the Addis Ababa Conference taught, to those who > will learn, this further lesson: Here is the part of Haile Selassie's speech put to music by Marley in his original song \\"War\\" (Bob Marley slightly modified the original words, changing each \\"that until\\" to \\"until\\" and added the word \\"war\\" several times): > That until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another inferior > is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned; That until there are > no longer first-class and second-class citizens of any nation; That until > the color of a man's skin is of no more significance than the color of his > eyes; That until the basic human rights are equally guaranteed to all > without regard to race; That until that day, the dream of lasting peace and > world citizenship and the rule of international morality will remain but a > fleeting illusion, to be pursued but never attained; And until the ignoble > and unhappy regimes that hold our brothers in Angola, in Mozambique and in > South Africa in subhuman bondage have been toppled and destroyed; Until > bigotry and prejudice and malicious and inhuman self-interest have been > replaced by understanding and tolerance and good-will; Until all Africans > stand and speak as free beings, equal in the eyes of all men, as they are in > the eyes of Heaven; Until that day, the African continent will not know > peace. We Africans will fight, if necessary, and we know that we shall win, > as we are confident in the victory of good over evil. - Haile Selassie I Here are the lyrics from the Bob Marley and the Wailers at the album Rastaman Vibration: A different mix, which includes a different horn arrangement, released as a bonus track in the Deluxe Edition (2002) of the Rastaman Vibration album, revealed that Marley had recorded an extra verse also adapted from the original speech: > Until bigotry and prejudice, malicious and inhuman self-interest have been > replaced by understanding and tolerance and good will, yeah, war. Until all > Africans stand and speak as free beings equal in the eyes of the almighty, > war. Everywhere is war. In his speech to the U.N., Selassie reminded his listeners that \\"these are only words; their value depends wholly on our will to observe and honor them and give them content and meaning.\\" The Song The original version of \\"War\\" was recorded at Harry J's studio in Kingston, Jamaica, by engineer Sylvan Morris. It includes Aston \\"Family Man\\" Barrett on Fender Jazz bass, his brother Carlton 'Carly' Barrett on drums, Earl \\"Chinna\\" Smith on guitar, Alvin \\"Seeco\\" Patterson on percussion and Tyrone Downie on keyboards. Marcia Griffiths, Judy Mowatt and Rita Marley sing harmony vocals as the I Three. It was produced by Bob Marley & The Wailers and mixed at Miami's Criteria studio by Aston \\"Family Man\\" Barrett and Chris Blackwell with engineer Alex Sadkin. With such potent and meaningful lyrics, the song soon became one of Bob Marley's greatest classics, carrying the Rastafari message to the world in Haile Selassie I's own words. As from 1977, when Bob Marley & The Wailers embarked for their first major world tour in June, \\"War\\" was sung at most concerts until Marley's last show on September 23, 1980 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Two live recordings of the song have since been released officially by Tuff Gong/Island Records. The first one was issued on the 1978 \\"Babylon by Bus\\" album recorded live at the Pavillon de Paris in Paris, France, on June 26, 1978. The second was recorded at the Rainbow Theatre in London, England, on June 4, 1977, and was issued on the 2001 Deluxe Edition of the Exodus album. Predating these two is another version, recorded on May 26, 1976 and released in 2003 on Live at the Roxy. Haile Selassie version Two other hit versions of the song featuring Bob Marley & the Wailers can also be heard. A vinyl single released in Jamaica on Bruno Blum's Human Race label in December 1997 includes samples of Bob Marley's voice saying \\"Rastafari is the prince of Peace.\\" But most importantly, the song features the original recording of Haile Selassie I's Amharic speech done in 1963, overdubbed on a new rhythm track played by Wailers original members. The B-side offers a welcome English translation of the speech by Bruno Blum, whose spoken rendition of War includes the second part of the speech not used by Bob Marley: A second mix of this new recording was also released, charting at the #1 spot in the U.K. Echoes magazine in April 1998. This time it featured samples of Bob Marley & the Wailers' song Selassie Is the Chapel (adapted from Crying in the Chapel), where Bob and Rita Marley's voices can be heard on a sizeable part of the record, as well as Selassie's original \\"foundation lead vocal,\\" creating a virtual duet between Haile Selassie I and his apostle Bob Marley. Both new versions were recorded at Kingston Musick Studio in Kingston, Jamaica, engineered by Rudy Thomas. They include Wailers survivors Aston \\"Family Man\\" Barrett on bass guitar and piano, Mikey \\"Boo\\" Richards\\" on drums and Earl \\"Wire\\" Lindo on keyboards, along with guitar and backing vocals by Bruno Blum. Percussionist Norbert \\"Nono\\" Nobour and backing singer Tatiana Prus were later added. The sessions were produced by Bruno Blum and mixed by Thierry Bertomeu at AB Studio in St. Denis, France. Released in Europe on Blum's Rastafari label in early 1998, both \\"War\\" and \\"War/Selassie Is the Chapel\\" were successful singles contributing to the \\"new roots\\" reggae scene where Rastafari themes sung by the likes of Garnett Silk, Luciano and Dennis Brown were popular again after more than a decade of decline. Several singles derived from this new recording were subsequently issued on the label, including Buffalo Bill's War/Warmongers, Big Youth's We No Want No War and Joseph Cotton's Conflicts backed by Doc Reggae's spoken French version Guerre. A full-length CD album entitled The War Album, including all versions, was issued in Europe on the Rastafari label in 2001. A vinyl album was released in Jamaica on the Human Race label in 2004, and the full War Album was reissued in 2010 as part of the Human Race label double CD anthology.

Ownership of the original game is necessary to play. While Civilization is in print (by Gibsons Games), Advanced Civilization isn't, following the dissolution of the original Avalon Hill game company and sale of all rights to titles to Hasbro in 1998. Features Advanced Civilization enhances the game as much as it expands it, clarifying rules and simplifying certain aspects of the game. New features include: * Assigning points to position on the Archaeological Succession Table (AST), rather than void a player from winning who has fallen behind in development * Unlimited Civilization cards, omitting the fight to acquire advances before other players * Seven new commodities cards, making the ever-important trade phase far more exciting * Four new calamity cards * Introduction of non- tradeable calamities * Eight new Civilization cards, including a new group: religion * Simplified trade to speed the game up * Rules for 8 players * Rules for late-comers and those that leave early Gameplay Gameplay is broadly similar to Civilization. Most phases of play have minor alterations which simplify or rebalance play, but are still similar to the original. Some of the major differences are in trade cards and calamities. There are more types of resources, as well as additional calamities. Calamities cannot be discarded or held, and a player who holds a calamity after trading becomes its primary victim, which encourages players to trade tradable calamity cards. The rules for trading are also simplified: each player in a trade must still trade three or more cards, but must only honestly state the number of cards being offered and the name of two of the cards, but not the total point value of the cards. One of the biggest changes is in determining the victor. Rather than being the first person to reach the end of the AST, victory is determined by points. The largest share of points typically comes from civilization cards, followed by position on the AST; other resources that earn points are cities in play, trade cards, and tokens in treasury. Video game Avalon Hill created a video game version of this game, called Avalon Hill's Advanced Civilization. The rules are slightly modified from the board version to make it suitable for computer play.

FARS contains data on a census of fatal traffic crashes within the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. To be included in FARS, a crash must involve a motor vehicle traveling on a trafficway customarily open to the public and result in the death of a person (occupant of a vehicle or a non-occupant) within 30 days of the crash. FARS has been operational since 1975 and has collected information on over 989,451 motor vehicle fatalities and collects information on over 100 different coded data elements that characterizes the crash, the vehicle, and the people involved. FARS is vital to the mission of NHTSA to reduce the number of motor vehicle crashes and deaths on our nation's highways, and subsequently, reduce the associated economic loss to society resulting from those motor vehicle crashes and fatalities. FARS data is critical to understanding the characteristics of the environment, trafficway, vehicles, and persons involved in the crash.

The stone is currently in the National Museum of Anthropology. At the end of the 18th century, by order of the viceroy of Bucareli, the items that formed part of the collection by Lorenzo Boturini — including the sculptures of Coatlicue and the Sun Stone — were placed in the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico, forming the core of the collection that would become the National Museum of Anthropology. On August 25, 1790, the Cabinet of Curiosities of Mexico (Gabinete de Historia Natural de México)This early cabinet of curiosities, Gabinete de Historia Natural de México, became years later the nowadays Museo de Historia Natural in Mexico City. was established by botanist José Longinos Martínez. During the 19th century, the museum was visited by internationally renowned scholars such as Alexander von Humboldt. In 1825, the first Mexican president, Guadalupe Victoria, advised by the historian Lucas Alamán, established the National Mexican Museum as an autonomous institution. In 1865, the Emperor Maximilian moved the museum to Calle de Moneda 13, to the former location of the Casa de Moneda. The \\"La Malinche\\" huipil it is made of cotton with feathers, wax and gold thread. The design is dominated by an image of a double headed eagle, showing both indigenous and Spanish influence. It is part of the collection of the Museo Nacional de Antropología. In 1906, due to the growth of the museum's collections, Justo Sierra divided the stock of the National Museum. The natural history collections were moved to the Chopo building, which was constructed specifically to shelter permanent expositions. The museum was renamed the National Museum of Archaeology, History and Ethnography, and was re-opened September 9, 1910, in the presence of President Porfirio Díaz. By 1924 the stock of the museum had increased to 52,000 objects and had received more than 250,000 visitors. In December 1940, the museum was divided again, with its historical collections being moved to the Chapultepec Castle, where they formed the Museo Nacional de Historia, focusing on the Viceroyalty of the New Spain and its progress towards modern Mexico. The remaining collection was renamed the National Museum of Anthropology, focusing on pre-Columbian Mexico and modern day Mexican ethnography. The construction of the contemporary museum building began in February 1963 in the Chapultepec park. The project was coordinated by architect Pedro Ramírez Vázquez, with assistance by Rafael Mijares Alcérreca and Jorge Campuzano. The construction of the building lasted 19 months, and was inaugurated on September 17, 1964, President Adolfo López Mateos, who declared: > The Mexican people lift this monument in honor of the admirable cultures > that flourished during the Pre-Columbian period in regions that are now > territory of the Republic. In front of the testimonies of those cultures, > the Mexico of today pays tribute to the indigenous people of Mexico, in > whose example we recognize characteristics of our national originality. The film Museo tells the story of the famous robbery to the National Museum of Anthropology on December 25, 1985, in Mexico City. Exhibits Original Aztec Sunstone is available for exhibit The museum's collections include the Stone of the Sun, giant stone heads of the Olmec civilization that were found in the jungles of Tabasco and Veracruz, treasures recovered from the Maya civilization, at the Sacred Cenote at Chichen Itza, a replica of the sarcophagal lid from Pacal's tomb at Palenque and ethnological displays of contemporary rural Mexican life. It also has a model of the location and layout of the former Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, the site of which is now occupied by the central area of modern-day Mexico City. The permanent exhibitions on the ground floor cover all pre-Columbian civilizations located on the current territory of Mexico as well as in former Mexican territory in what is today the southwestern United States. They are classified as North, West, Maya, Gulf of Mexico, Oaxaca, Mexico, Toltec, and Teotihuacan. The permanent expositions at the first floor show the culture of Native American population of Mexico since the Spanish colonization. The museum also hosts visiting exhibits, generally focusing on other of the world's great cultures. Past exhibits have focused on ancient Iran, Greece, China, Egypt, Russia, and Spain.

History Originally called A.P. Leto Comprehensive High School, it was named in honor of Ateo Phillip Leto, a former principal at Jefferson High School and at Chamberlain High School in Tampa. He was originally to serve as the school's first principal, but he died before the school year began. The first principal of Leto was Frank M. Farmer. Established in 1965 with grades 9-11, which meant that the first graduating class was not until 1967, Leto was the first comprehensive high school in Hillsborough County. It was \\"comprehensive\\" because in addition to the high school academic curriculum, Leto offered several modern vocational options for students. Although the largest school in Hillsborough County, it originally lacked a gymnasium, a stadium, baseball and softball fields, which were added in the 1970s. According to Leto's official website, the students of the first graduating class of 1967 chose the school's colors, mascot, alma mater and several other traditions that continue to be practiced at Leto High. The school opened with 1,670 students its first year and is situated on .  Magnet School  Created in 2013, Collegiate Academy is a magnet program provided by Hillsborough Community College.

The manor was the seat of the Lords of Aldingham, and included at its peak the villages of Bardsea, Urswick, Scales, Stainton, Sunbrick, Baycliff, Gleaston, Aldingham, Dendron, Leece and Newbiggin. The area also features the historic remains of Gleaston Castle, Aldingham Castle, Gleaston Water Mill, the Druids' Temple at Birkrigg, plus many prehistoric remains around Urswick and Scales.  The Place  The area that became Muchland in the Middle Ages is situated on the eastern side of the Furness Peninsula in southwest Cumbria. On its eastern side, it is bounded for its entire length by the sands of Morecambe Bay, the shore of which has eroded considerably since the manor was created. Along the coast lie the villages, from north to south, of: *Bardsea, *Baycliff, *Aldingham, *Newbiggin, *Goadsbarrow. Muchland derives its name from Michael's Land after Michael le Fleming who was granted the lands by Henry I sometime between 1107 and 1111. These lands lay eastwards of Abbey Beck and southwards of the moors of Birkrigg and Swarthmoor and stretched right down to the southernmost tip of the peninsula at Rampside.F Barnes, Barrow and District, 1968 At that time the southern limit of the manor was Walney Channel, but it was later moved inland to follow the line of Sarah Beck or Roosebeck. This land became the new manor of Aldingham Aldingham is home to the Church of Saint Cuthbert, who was laid here after death on his journey to be buried. A little further down is the remains of Aldingham Moat and Aldingham Motte, both homes to the Lords of Aldingham in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Newbiggin was once home to Sea Mill, one of the three mills of the manor. The western boundary of the manor is now the Borough of Barrow-in-Furness, which was originally land belonging to Stephen of Blois, but belonged to Furness Abbey from 1127 until 1536 when Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries. There were numerous debates over the hunting rights between the Lords of Aldingham and the Abbots of Furness in places like Leece and Stainton, which lay at the western boundary of the manor. The small village of Dendron, also on the western boundary, is home to the seventeenth century Saint Matthew's Church where the artist George Romney went to school for a time. Further east from Dendron is Gleaston, the geographical and administrative centre of the manor from the mid-thirteenth century. The village is dominated by Beacon Hill to the northeast, which legend says was used to signal danger to Piel Castle to the south, which can clearly be seen from the top of the hill. The village boasts the remains of Gleaston Castle and Gleaston Water Mill, the second corn mill of the manor. Gleaston Beck runs through the valley here from Urswick Tarn in the north to the coast at Newbiggin. North of Gleaston are Scales and Little and Great Urswick. Little Urswick is now home to Low Furness Primary School, but was previously home to a seventeenth-century grammar school. Great Urswick, built around two sides of Urswick Tarn, boasts the ancient Church of Saint Mary and Saint Michael. It would seem this area was of considerable activity in the Iron Age. To the east of Urswick is Birkrigg Common, so called because it was shared in common with the men of Urswick and Aldingham. This rocky hill has a number of archeological sites, including an ancient stone circle, and has views across Morecambe Bay, Furness and the mountains of the Lake District. On the edge of the common lies the small hamlet of Sunbrick, which is now little more than a few farms and houses, but shelters a small walled Quaker graveyard where leading Quaker Margaret Fell, who lived at nearby Swarthmoor Hall, is buried. The northern boundary of the manor generally follows the line of the road leading from Lindal-in-Furness in the west to Conishead Priory on the coast. Beyond it is the market town of Ulverston and the manor of Pennington. =The Lost Villages of Muchland= It is known that several villages which once existed in Muchland have since disappeared off the map. Local legends are full of tales about villages on the coast being swept away by the encroaching tides, although there is little to substantiate the tales. It is certain that the gravelly coastline must have suffered considerable erosion over the past centuries and that any village too near the shore might have fallen victim to its advances. Aldingham, for example, may once have been up to a mile in length, stretching out into what is now Morecambe Bay with the church at its centre. Besides those villages lost to the sea, several others have disappeared. Perhaps the most interesting is Hart, which is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Hert. There was later a mill named Hart Mill which is known to have been in the vicinity of Gleaston. Archeological investigations have taken place to discover the site of this early mill around the valley where Gleaston Water Mill now stands, but they have yielded little evidence. The name Hart was probably shortened from Hart Carrs, which means 'marsh of the harts'. To the south of Gleaston, at the end of Carrs Lane, there is a large flat area which has been drained, through which still flows Hart Carrs Beck. It is possible that the village once stood in this area. Two other villages named in the Domesday Book have also disappeared, but are even more difficult to track down. Crivelton probably stood on the coast between Rampside and Roose but has since been washed away by the sea. The name is recorded as Clivertun in the Domesday Book, which suggests a location on a cliff. Fordbootle was probably situated somewhere around modern-day Stank, although its name suggests a location beside a watercourse, possibly further west on the River Yarl. Both Clivertun and Fordbootle were listed in the Domesday Book as vills or townships forming the Manor of Hougun held by Earl Tostig. Around 1153 Roose, Crivelton and Fordbootle were part of an exchange of land between Muchland and Furness Abbey, suggesting that it was certainly situated in that area. A final village to be mentioned in the Domesday Book is Alia Lies, meaning 'another Leece'. The position of this lost village is by no means certain, but it may have been in the area of Old Holbeck, to the west of present-day Leece, or nearer the coast to the south of the village.  History  =Before the Manor= The area later named Muchland has been inhabited since at least the Mesolithic period and evidence of Upper Paleolithic habitation has been found in caves at Scales. Remains of prehistoric settlements from the mesolithic to the Bronze Age have been found at Gleaston and Scales, including a bronze sword and axe head, and human bones. It is believed that a post-glacial lake near Gleaston would have provided food and resources for a small community from the end of the last ice age to the Bronze Age. There is a small stone circle on Birkrigg Common known locally as the Druids' Temple which revealed a Bronze Age burial urn during excavations [OL6 292741]. In the Iron Age, when the Carvetii and, later, Brigantes tribes inhabited the region, there was a great deal of activity on the rocky ground surrounding present-day Urswick and Scales. There are visible remains of a fort to the north of Great Urswick [OL6 274753], a settlement northwest of Little Urswick known as Urswick Stone Walls [OL6 260740] and a homestead to the east [OL6 275734] as well as numerous tumuli and burial chambers in the area. Boundary ditch and wall surrounding the Iron Age settlement Urswick Stone Walls The Romans may also have been present in Urswick during their occupation. Recent archeological investigations in the area may have uncovered the presence of a Roman fort (a claim which has been criticised by leading local archeologists) and it is believed that the parish church of St Mary and St Michael may contain remnants of a sub-Roman church which could have been the centre of a monastery, although all of these claims are yet to be substantiated by solid evidence. It is possible that the Romans exploited the rich iron-ore resources of the area, which had been utilised in previous times and provided the catalyst for a booming industrial economy in the area in the 19th century. In the 4th century AD this part of England belonged to the kingdom of Coel Hen, known as Northern Britain or Kyle, but was later in a division of that kingdom known as Rheged. Little is known about the local history at this point, but it is known that the area would have remained Celtic until around the 8th century when Rheged was annexed to Northumbria and English Angles began to filter in. In 685AD land in south Cumbria was granted to Saint Cuthbert and it was recorded that the area still had a significant British population. Part of an early English cross bearing a runic inscription from around this period is available to view in Urswick church. The English slowly displaced or assimilated the native Cumbric Celts, although they may have remained in pockets around the region (as is evidenced by place names such as Walney, meaning 'Isle of the British' from Old Norse walna+ey). In 925AD Norsemen began landing on the local shores from Norway via Ireland, Man and Scotland but they seem to have been peaceable farmers rather than vicious warriors and they settled amongst the English and British in the region, although part of a Norse sword was found in nearby Rampside. The Norse influence on the area was a significant one, shown not only by the large number of Norse place-names in the area, but also by the discovery of a 12th- century inscription at Loppergarth near Ulverston, which contained a curious mix of both Norse and English runes. =The Lords of Muchland= The le Flemings After the Norman Conquest in 1066 the small manor of Aldingham was granted to Roger de Poitou as part of a much larger holding which included land across much of the north of England. At that time the area was on the very fringe of Norman England. When the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086 Aldingham had been confiscated from de Poitou for his part in a plot against William I, but it was returned to him shortly after. By 1102 Aldingham had been confiscated from de Poitou once again, but before this he had built a ringwork near the coast at Aldingham. Around 1107 Aldingham was granted to Michael le Fleming (Latinized to Flandrensis, \\"of Flanders\\") and it was he who gave his name to the manor, literally \\"Michael's Land\\". At this point the manor stretched from Walney Channel around Rampside and Roose north to Sunbrick and Great Urswick. It was Michael or one of his sons that erected the motte at Aldingham on the site of Roger de Poitou's ringwork [OL6 278698]. In 1153, the second Michael le Fleming agreed an exchange of land with Furness Abbey, giving up Roose, Fordbootle and Crivelton for Little Urswick and part of Foss, near Bootle in Cumberland, so that the Abbot could get greater access to his port at Piel. By the early 13th century the wealth and importance of the manor had increased significantly and the Lord of the manor was granted the right to hold his own courts Leet and Baron. The manor of Bardsea was also added to the le Fleming estate. Around this time the seat of the manor of Muchland was moved from the motte at Aldingham to a nearby moated site [OL6 279700], probably due to the advance of the sea and the erosion of the hill on which the motte stands. In 1227 the overlordship of Muchland was changed from the Duke of Lancaster to Furness Abbey. This seems to have been an unwelcome decision for the Lords of Aldingham, as the Abbot began claiming rights to lands within the bounds of Muchland. Over coming years, William le Fleming (alias de Furness) got into several disputes over hunting rights with his neighbour the Abbot of Furness which eventually resulted in William being exempt from formal attendance at the Abbots Court and the men of Muchland being banned from entering the Abbot's town of Dalton-in-Furness. The de Haringtons Gleaston Castle from the north In the mid 13th century Michael de Furness - direct ancestor of the first Lord of Aldingham - died crossing the Leven Sands in Morecambe Bay after dining at Cartmel Priory and the manor passed to the Cansfield family from Lancashire through Michael's sister Alina de Furness. It was probably Richard de Cansfield who initiated the move inland from Aldingham to Gleaston, where a wooden hall was probably built about 0.5 km north of the present village [OL6 262715]. When Alina and Richard's son William de Cansfield was drowned in the River Severn the manor passed again through a female heir to the de Harington family from north west Cumbria. The son of that marriage, John de Harington (1281–1347) was knighted in 1306 and was created Baron Harington upon being summoned by writ to Parliament in 1326. It was he who was responsible for the building of Gleaston Castle on the site of the previous hall, which was begun before 1325 and finished around 1340. The 1st Baron seems to have been quite a contradictory character. Not only was he a member of Parliament, he sat on councils, was a Commissioner of array for eight years, sat on various commissions in the north of England, and completed his obligatory military service with Edward, Prince of Wales and Andrew de Harcla. But he was also involved in a faction opposed to Piers Gaveston and complied in his murder, for which he received a pardon in 1313 and was pardoned again in 1318. His activities with Andrew de Harcla in the Scottish Marches led to his being outlawed in 1323 on discovery of Harcla's treason, but he was pardoned upon surrender then awarded as custodian of the truce with Scotland. During their time as lords of the manor of Muchland the de Harringtons increased their estate greatly through marriage to heiresses, gaining lands in Devon, Cornwall, Leicestershire, Ireland, and further lands in Cumberland and Westmorland. In 1460 the only male heir to the manor, William Bonville was killed at the age of 17 along with his father and grandfather at the Battle of Wakefield leaving behind a new born baby girl, Cecilia. She later married Thomas Grey, 1st Marquis of Dorset, who was grandfather to Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, who was father of Lady Jane Grey who became Queen of England but was beheaded after nine days by Queen Mary. And so the manor passed to the crown in whose hands it remained until it was given to the Cavendish family of Holker Hall in the 18th century who held it until 1926 when it was sold.

Lady Frances Brandon  Lady Jane Grey  Toponymy  Muchland was originally 'Michael's Land', which changed to 'Mickle Land' from the local version of Michael, which was confused with another local term from the Old Norse mikkel meaning 'great' and so became 'Much Land' Adgarley means 'Eadgar's slope' from Old English Eadgars hlið Aldingham means 'home of Alda's people or descendants' from the Old English Alda+inga+ham. [Domesday Aldingham] Bardsea ?unsure. Possibly 'bard's resting place' from Celtic bard eisteddfa [Domesday Berretseige] Baycliff ?unsure. There are no notable cliffs in the area, despite the village overlooking Morecambe Bay. [early form Belleclive, 1212] Birkrigg Common 'ridge with birch trees' from Old Norse birkr hryggr Bolton probably 'farmstead with a shelter' from Old Norse boðl tun, the Domesday Book records this as Bolton-le-Moors Crivelton ?unsure. Domesday records this lost village as Clivertun, which probably means 'village on a cliff' from OE clif+ton. There may be an additional Old Norse element meaning 'hill', klif+haugr+tun Dendron Probably clearing in a valley from Old English denu+rum. [Domesday Dene] Fordbootle 'dwelling by a ford' from ford+boðl [Domesday fordebodele] Gleaston means 'green hill farm' from Old Norse glas+haugr+tun. [Domesday Glassertun] Goadsbarrow means 'Godi's or Gauti's burial mound' with the Old English beorg Harbarrow There are several explanations. The second element is certainly 'hill' from Old English beorg. The first is probably 'hare' from Old English hara (there is a Hare Hill nearby), but may also be 'herd' from heord, 'oats' from Old Norse hafri, or 'grey' from Old English har. Hart now lost, this probably just means 'hart' or 'stag' from Old Norse hjortr. It seems likely this is a shortening of the name Hart Carrs, which means 'marsh where harts live' with Old Norse kjarr. Hart Carrs Beck flows through an area of flat, often boggy land. [Domesday Hert] Holbeck 'stream in a hole' from Old Norse hol-bekkr' Leece means 'glades' from Old English leahs. [Domesday Lies] Newbiggin means 'new building' with Old or Middle English biggin Rampside either 'Hrafn's shieling' from Old Norse Hrafns saetr or 'ram's head' from Old English ramms heofod, referring to the shape of the coast Roose 'moor' from the Brythonic Celtic ros Scales means 'huts' from Old Norse skalis Scarbarrow ?unsure. Possibly 'hill with huts' from Old Norse skali berg, but may also be 'hill with a scar' - there is a small stream which has eroded the hill into a steep gully. Skeldon Moor possibly ridge or ledge from a local word skelf, or 'shell midden' with Old Norse skel dun and Old English mōr Stainton means 'farm by stones' from Old Norse steinn+tun [Domesday Steintun] Sunbrick means 'pig slope' from Old Norse svin+brekka [Domesday Suntun, meaning 'pig farm'] Urswick ?unsure. '-wick' could either be related to Latin vicus meaning 'town', which is a common feature of places along Roman roads (there's evidence of one to the north); or it could be from Old English wick meaning 'farm'  See also  *Gleaston *Cumbria *History of Cumbria *Furness *Middle Ages References Furness ","title":"Muchland"},{"id":"4009888","text":"Gandalf (born Heinz Strobl, born 1952) is the name used by a new-age Austrian composer.

In August 1861, the Union Army (and the United States Congress) determined that the US would no longer return escaped slaves who went to Union lines and classified them as \\"contraband of war\\", or captured enemy property. They used many as laborers to support Union efforts and soon began to pay them wages. The former slaves set up camps near Union forces, and the Army helped support and educate both adults and children among the refugees. Thousands of men from these camps enlisted in the United States Colored Troops when recruitment started in 1863. At war's end, more than 100 contraband camps existed in the South, including the Freedmen's Colony of Roanoke Island, where 3500 former slaves worked to develop a self- sufficient community. History The status of Southern-owned slaves after Confederate states had engaged in the American Civil War became an issue early in 1861, not long after hostilities began. At Fort Monroe in Virginia's Hampton Roads, Major General Benjamin Butler, commander, learned that three slaves had made their way across Hampton Roads harbor from Confederate- occupied Norfolk County, and presented themselves at Union-held Fort Monroe. General Butler refused to return the escaped slaves to slaveholders who supported the Confederacy. This amounted to classifying them as \\"contraband,\\" although the first use of that terminology in military records appears to have been by another officer. (see below). The three slaves, Frank Baker, James Townsend, and Sheppard Mallory, had been leased by their masters to the Confederate Army to help construct defense batteries at Sewell's Point, across the mouth of Hampton Roads from the Union-held Fort Monroe. They escaped at night and rowed a skiff to Old Point Comfort, where they sought asylum at Fort Monroe. Prior to the War, the owners of the slaves would have been legally entitled to request their return (as property) and likely would have done so under the federal 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. But, Virginia had declared (by secession) that it no longer was part of the United States. General Butler, who was educated as an attorney, took the position that, if Virginia considered itself a foreign power to the U.S., then he was under no obligation to return the three men; he would hold them as \\"contraband of war.\\" When Confederate Major John B. Cary requested their return, Butler refused the request. Because the practice effectively recognized the seceded states as foreign entities, President Abraham Lincoln disapproved of it. Gen. Butler did not pay the escaped slaves wages for work that they began to undertake, and he continued to refer to them as slaves. On September 25, 1861, the Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles issued a directive to give \\"persons of color, commonly known as contrabands\\", in the employment of the Union Navy pay at the rate of $10 per month and a full day's ration.Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the War of the Rebellion, Series I - Volume 16, page 689. Three weeks later, the Union Army followed suit, paying male \\"contrabands\\" at Fort Monroe $8 a month and females $4, and specific to that command.The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series 2 - Volume 1, p. 774 In August, the US Congress passed the Confiscation Act of 1861, which declared that any property used by the Confederate military, including slaves, could be confiscated by Union forces. The next March, its Act Prohibiting the Return of Slaves forbade returning slaves to Confederate masters or the military. Grand Contraband Camp The word spread quickly among southeastern Virginia's slave communities. While becoming a \\"contraband\\" did not mean full freedom, many slaves considered it a step in that direction. The day after Butler's decision, many more escaped slaves found their way to Fort Monroe and appealed to become contraband. As the number of former slaves grew too large to be housed inside the Fort, the contrabands erected housing outside the crowded base from the burned ruins of the City of Hampton. They called their new settlement Grand Contraband Camp (which they nicknamed \\"Slabtown\\"). By the end of the war in April 1865, less than four years later, an estimated 10,000 escaped slaves had applied to gain \\"contraband\\" status, with many living nearby. Across the South, Union forces managed more than 100 contraband camps, although not all were as large. From a camp on Roanoke Island that started in 1862, Horace James developed the Freedmen's Colony of Roanoke Island (1863–1867). Appointed by the Union Army, James was a Congregational chaplain who, with the freedmen, tried to create a self-sustaining colony at the island.\\"The Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony\\" , provided by National Park Service, at North Carolina Digital History: LEARN NC, accessed 11 November 2010 Near Fort Monroe, but outside its protective walls, the pioneering teacher Mary S. Peake began to teach both adult and child contrabands to read and write. She was the first black teacher hired by the American Missionary Association, which also sent numerous Northern white teachers to the South to teach. This area of Elizabeth City County later became part of the campus of Hampton University, a historically black college. Defying a Virginia law against educating slaves, Peake and other teachers held classes outdoors under a certain large oak tree. In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation was read to the contrabands and free blacks there, for which the tree was named the Emancipation Oak. For most of the contrabands, full emancipation did not take place until the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution abolishing slavery was ratified in late 1865. Contraband term first used by William Budd General Butler's written statements and communications with the War Department requesting guidance on the issue of fugitive slaves did not use the term \\"contraband.\\"The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series 2 - Volume 1, page 752; Series 1 - Volume 2, page 52. As late as August 9, 1861, he used the term \\"slaves\\" for fugitives who had come to Fort Monroe.The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series 1 - Volume 2, page 761. On August 10, 1861, Acting Master William Budd of the gunboat USS Resolute first used the term in an official US military record.Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the War of the Rebellion, Series I - Volume 4: page 604. As early as 1812, the term, \\"contraband\\" was used in general language to refer to illegally smuggled goods (including slaves).The Pirate Lafitte and the Battle of New Orleans, Robert Tallant. Random House 1951. Pelican Edition 1998 pg 65. Development Contraband camps developed around many Union-held forts and encampments. In 1863, after the Emancipation Proclamation and authorization of black military units, thousands of former slaves and free blacks began to enlist in the United States Colored Troops. The Army allowed their families to take refuge at contraband camps. The black troops ultimately comprised nearly 10 percent of all the troops in the Union Army. By the end of the war, more than 100 contraband camps had been developed in the South. Many were assisted by missionary teachers recruited from the North by the American Missionary Association and other groups who, together with free blacks and freedmen, agreed that education of the former slaves was of the highest priority. The teachers often wrote about the desire of former slaves, both adults and children, for education.

Since its foundation in 1990, its stated mission has been to accelerate the effective exploitation of novel computing throughout industry, academia and commerce. The University has supported high-performance computing (HPC) services since 1982. , through EPCC, it supports the UK's national high-end computing system, ARCHER (Advanced Research Computing High End Resource), and the UK Research Data Facility (UK-RDF).  Overview  EPCC's activities include: consultation and software development for industry and academia; research into high-performance computing; hosting advanced computing facilities and supporting their users; training and education . The Centre offers two Masters programmes: MSc in High-Performance Computing and MSc in High-Performance Computing with Data Science . It is a member of the Globus Alliance and, through its involvement with the OGSA-DAI project, it works with the Open Grid Forum DAIS-WG. Around half of EPCC's annual turnover comes from collaborative projects with industry and commerce. In addition to privately funded projects with businesses, EPCC receives funding from Scottish Enterprise, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the European Commission.  History  EPCC was established in 1990, following on from the earlier Edinburgh Concurrent Supercomputer Project and chaired by Jeffery Collins from 1991. From 2002 to 2016 EPCC was part of the University's School of Physics & Astronomy, becoming an independent Centre of Excellence within the University's College of Science and Engineering in August 2016. It was extensively involved in all aspects of Grid computing including: developing Grid middleware and architecture tools to facilitate the uptake of e-Science; developing business applications and collaborating in scientific applications and demonstration projects. The Centre was a founder member of the UK's National e-Science Centre (NeSC), the hub of Grid and e-Science activity in the UK. EPCC and NeSC were both partners in OMII-UK, which offers consultancy and products to the UK e-Science community. EPCC was also a founder partner of the Numerical Algorithms and Intelligent Software Centre (NAIS). EPCC has hosted a variety of supercomputers over the years, including several Meiko Computing Surfaces, a Thinking Machines CM-200 Connection Machine, and a number of Cray systems including a Cray T3D and T3E.  High-performance computing facilities  EPCC manages a collection of HPC systems including ARCHER (the UK's national high- end computing system) and a variety of smaller HPC systems. These systems are all available for industry use on a pay-per-use basis. Current systems hosted by EPCC include: * ARCHER: As of 2014, the ARCHER facility is based around a Cray XC30 supercomputer that provides the central computational resource.

She was a captain of the English women's cricket team in 1934 and 1935. In 1934/35 she led the first English cricket team to tour Australia and New Zealand, the result of which was a 2–0 victory over Australia. This tour did much both to raise the status of women's cricket and to heal some of the damage done to Anglo-Australian cricket relations by bodyline two years earlier. Biography  Archdale was born in London, the daughter of Helen Archdale (née Russel), a suffragette who was at one time jailed for smashing windows at Whitehall, and was later renowned as a leading British feminist; and an Irish professional soldier in the British Army, who died in World War I when she was eleven. Her godmother was Emmeline Pankhurst. Archdale attended Bedales School in Hampshire where she learned to play cricket and, thence, to St Leonards School in St Andrews, Fife. After school Archdale attended McGill University in Montreal, graduating in 1929 with a BA in Economics and Political Science. She studied Law in London. Specialising in international law, she conducted part of her studies in the Soviet Union. In 1938 she was called to the Bar at Gray's Inn. During World War II, she served in the WRNS as a wireless operator in Singapore. She arrived in July 1941 at the head of a group of forty Wrens trained in wireless telegraphy. 'History of Far East Combined Bureau and H.M.S. Anderson', typescript in the National Archives, HW 4/25, chapter 2, p. 10. She was awarded an Order of the British Empire for helping nurses escape from the conflict. Having moved to Australia, in 1946 she was appointed principal of Sydney University's \\"Women's College\\", a post she held for 10 years. Archdale was a member of the University Senate for 25 years, and a television and radio personality throughout the 1960s. Archdale was headmistress of the private girls school Abbotsleigh in Wahroonga, Sydney for 12 years from 1958. Archdale was credited with breaking down the rigid system of discipline at the school, with introducing sex education and abandoning the gloves and hat as part of the school uniform. She also reformed the curriculum, introducing physics and cutting back on British, in favour of Australian, history. The Assembly Hall (1963) and Chapel (1965) both date from this time. She lived on an estate in Galston, Sydney with her brother Alexander Archdale, an actor. Honours and legacy In 1997, she was listed as a National Living Treasure. In March 1999, Archdale was one of the first ten women to be granted Honorary Life Membership of Marylebone Cricket Club in England. She died in January 2000 at the age of 92, in Sydney. The Association of Heads of Independent Girls' Schools, 'Archdale Debating' competition (for Sydney's private and Catholic girls' schools) is named in her honour.

Painted in 1837 as a result of the visit to Hobart with J.P. Fawkner. (Dixon Galleries, State Library of NSW.) Derrimut's gravestone in Melbourne General Cemetery Derrimut (or Derremart or Terrimoot) ( – 20 April 1864), was a headman or arweet of the Boonwurrung (Bunurong) people from the Melbourne area of Australia.Ian D. Clark, \\"You have all this place, no good have children ...\\" Derrimut: traitor, saviour, or a man of his people?, in the Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society, 1 December 2005. Accessed 8 November 2008 He informed the early European settlers in October 1835 of an impending attack by \\"up-country tribes\\". The colonists armed themselves, and the attack was averted. Benbow from the Bunurong and Billibellary, from the Wurundjeri, also acted to protect the colonists in what is perceived as part of their duty of hospitality. He fought in the late 1850s and early 1860s to protect Boonwurrung rights to live on their land at Mordialloc Reserve. When the reserve was closed in July 1863, his people were forced to unite with the remnants of Woiwurrung and other Victorian Aboriginal communities to settle Coranderrk Mission station, near Healesville. Derrimut became very disillusioned and died at the Melbourne Benevolent Asylum at the age of about 54 years in 1864. In his honour, over his body, interred in the Melbourne General Cemetery according to European rather than Aboriginal rites, a tombstone was erected. Text of the tombstone: “This stone was erected by a few colonists To commemorate the noble act of the native Chief Derrimut who by timely information given October 1835 to the first colonists Messrs Fawkner, Lancey, Evans, Henry Batman and their saved them from massacre, planned by some of the up-country tribes of Aborigines. Derrimut closed his mortal career in the Benevolent Asylum, May 28th 1864 ; aged about 54 Years” The Melbourne suburb of Derrimut is named after him.

It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. It is licensed and marketed for the short-term treatment of moderately-severe insomnia. It was patented in 1975 and came into medical use in 1983. Medical uses Insomnia can be described as a difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakenings or a combination of each. Loprazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine and is sometimes used in patients who have difficulty in maintaining sleep or have difficulty falling asleep. Hypnotics should only be used on a short-term basis or in those with chronic insomnia on an occasional basis. =Dose= The dose of loprazolam for insomnia is usually 1 mg but can be increased to 2 mg if necessary. In the elderly a lower dose is recommended due to more pronounced effects and a significant impairment of standing up to 11 hours after dosing of 1 mg of loprazolam. The half-life is much more prolonged in the elderly than in younger patients. A half-life of 19.8 hours has been reported in elderly patients. Patients and prescribing physicians should, however, bear in mind that higher doses of loprazolam may impair long-term memory functions. Side effects Side effects of loprazolam are generally the same as for other benzodiazepines such as diazepam.British National Formulary Benzodiazepines Information The most significant difference in side effects of loprazolam and diazepam is it is less prone to day time sedation as the half-life of loprazolam is considered to be intermediate whereas diazepam has a very long half-life. The side effects of loprazolam are the following: * drowsiness * paradoxical increase in aggression * lightheadedness * confusion * muscle weakness * ataxia (particularly in the elderly) * amnesia * headache * vertigo * hypotension *salivation changes * gastro-intestinal disturbances * visual disturbances * dysarthria * tremor * changes in libido * incontinence * urinary retention * blood disorders and jaundice * skin reactions * dependence and withdrawal reactions Residual 'hangover' effects after nighttime administration of loprazolam such as sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and cognitive functions may persist into the next day which may increase risks of falls and hip fractures. =Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal= Loprazolam, like all other benzodiazepines, is recommended only for the short- term management of insomnia in the UK, owing to the risk of serious adverse effects such as tolerance, dependence and withdrawal, as well as adverse effects on mood and cognition. Benzodiazepines can become less effective over time, and patients can develop increasing physical and psychological adverse effects, e.g., agorophobia, gastrointestinal complaints, and peripheral nerve abnormalities such as burning and tingling sensations. Loprazolam has a low risk of physical dependence and withdrawal if it is used for less than 4 weeks or very occasionally. However, one placebo-controlled study comparing 3 weeks of treatment for insomnia with either loprazolam or triazolam showed rebound anxiety and insomnia occurring 3 days after discontinuing loprazolam therapy, whereas with triazolam the rebound anxiety and insomnia was seen the next day. The differences between the two are likely due to the differing elimination half-lives of the two drugs. These results would suggest that loprazolam and possibly other benzodiazepines should be prescribed for 1–2 weeks rather than 2–4 weeks to reduce the risk of physical dependence, withdrawal, and rebound phenomenon. ;Withdrawal symptoms Slow reduction of the dosage over a period of months at a rate that the individual can tolerate greatly minimizes the severity of the withdrawal symptoms. Individuals who are benzodiazepine dependent often cross to an equivalent dose of diazepam to taper gradually, as diazepam has a longer half-life and small dose reductions can be achieved more easily.(Roche Products (UK) Ltd 1990) Benzodiazepines and Your Patients: A Management Programme *anxiety and panic attacks *sweating *nightmares *insomnia *headache *tremor *nausea and vomiting *feelings of unreality *abnormal sensation of movement *hypersensitivity to stimuli *hyperventilation *flushing *sweating *palpitations *dimensional distortions of rooms and television pictures *paranoid thoughts and feelings of persecution *depersonalization *fears of going mad *heightened perception of taste, smell, sound, and light; photophobia *agoraphobia *clinical depression *poor memory and concentration *aggression *excitability *Somatic Symptoms *numbness *altered sensations of the skin *pain *stiffness *weakness in the neck, head, jaw, and limbs *muscle fasciculation, ranging from twitches to jerks, affecting the legs or shoulders *ataxia *paraesthesia *influenza-like symptoms *blurred double vision *menorrhagia *loss of or dramatic gain in appetite *thirst with polyuria *urinary incontinence *dysphagia *abdominal pain *diarrhoea *constipation Major complications can occur after abrupt or rapid withdrawal, especially from high doses, producing symptoms such as: *psychosis *confusion *visual and auditory hallucinations *delusions *epileptic seizures (which may be fatal) *suicidal thoughts or actions *abnormal, often severe, drug seeking behavior It has been estimated that between 30% and 50% of long- term users of benzodiazepines will experience withdrawal symptoms. However, up to 90% of patients withdrawing from benzodiazepines experienced withdrawal symptoms in one study, but the rate of taper was very fast at 25% of dose per week. Withdrawal symptoms tend to last between 3 weeks to 3 months, although 10–15% of people may experience a protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome with symptoms persisting and gradually declining over a period of many months and occasionally several years. Contraindications and special caution Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Loprazolam, similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. Mechanism of action Loprazolam is a benzodiazepine, which acts via positively modulating the GABAA receptor complex via a binding to the benzodiazepine receptor which is situated on alpha subunit containing GABAA receptors. This action enhances the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA on the GABAA receptor complex by increasing the opening frequency of the chloride ion channel. This action allows more chloride ions to enter the neuron which in turn produces such effects as; muscle relaxation, anxiolytic, hypnotic, amnesic and anticonvulsant action. These properties can be used for therapeutic benefit in clinical practice. These properties are also sometimes used for recreational purposes in the form of drug abuse of benzodiazepines where high doses are used to achieve intoxication and or sedation. Pharmacokinetics After oral administration of loprazolam on an empty stomach, it takes 2 hours for serum concentration levels to peak, significantly longer than other benzodiazepine hypnotics. This delay brings into question the benefit of loprazolam for the treatment of insomnia when compared to other hypnotics (particularly when the major complaint is difficulty falling asleep instead of difficulty maintaining sleep for the entire night), although some studies show that loprazolam may induce sleep within half an hour, indicating rapid penetration into the brain. The peak plasma delay of loprazolam, therefore, may not be relevant to loprazolam's efficacy as a hypnotic. If taken after a meal it can take even longer for loprazolam plasma levels to peak and peak levels may be lower than normal. Loprazolam significantly alters electrical activity in the brain as measured by EEG, with these changes becoming more pronounced as the dose increases. Roughly half of each dose is metabolized in humans to produce an active metabolite, (a piperazine with lesser potency), the other half is excreted unchanged. The half-life of the active metabolite is about the same as the parent compound loprazolam.

He also had short spells with Orlando Magic, Golden State Warriors and Boston Celtics before moving to Australia to play for the Perth Wildcats. Lichti was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019. College career In four seasons with Stanford, Lichti averaged 18.8 points per game, 5.3 rebounds per game and 2.5 assists per game, appearing in 124 games. At graduation Lichti was Stanford's all-time leading scorer with 2,336 points, a record broken by Chasson Randle on March 31, 2015. Professional career =NBA= Lichti started his professional career when he was drafted via the 15th overall pick by the Denver Nuggets in the 1989 NBA Draft. With the Nuggets, he performed well in his first season (8 points per game), and continued to improve in his second season (14 points per game), before knee injuries limited him to 29 of 82 contests. Various injuries (including being involved in a serious car accident, which killed his fiancée, Kirstin Gravrock of Bellevue, Washington) further kept him from playing at a competitive level. Lichti stayed on in Denver for two more seasons until August 19, 1993, when he was traded to the Orlando Magic for Brian Williams. He played a combined 13 games with three different teams before being waived by the Golden State Warriors in 1993-94, his final NBA season. =NBL= His last appearance was in the Australian National Basketball League with the Perth Wildcats. Lichti's recruitment was in part due to his association with native Perth player Andrew Vlahov, with whom he was teammates at Stanford. Lichti played 82 games over four seasons for the Wildcats from 1996–99, and averaged impressive NBL career stats of 16.8 points, 5.4 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.6 steals per game.

He was born in Armagh, Ireland, and died in St. John's, Newfoundland. Harvey was of Scottish descent and was educated at the Royal Academical Institute at Belfast. He became an ordained minister in the Presbyterian ministry in 1844. Harvey served at the John Street Presbyterian Church, Maryport, Cumberland, England until he emigrated to St. John's in 1852 with his bride Sarah Anne Browne. He served at St. Andrews Free Presbyterian Church in St. John's. His sermons there become an inspiration as a lecturer and a writer where he had written over 900 articles in a 24-year period that was published in the Montreal Gazette under the pen name Delta. Harvey is the co-founder of the Evening Mercury newspaper. Harvey had studied many aspects of Newfoundland's natural history, most notably the habits of the giant squid. One species, Architeuthis harveyi, was named in recognition of his work. It was largely through his efforts that the giant squids became known to British and American zoologists. Harvey's interests in Newfoundland were varied, he had called for the creation of a cross-island railroad, he was president of the St. John's Athenaeum Society, he pressed for the development of mining in Newfoundland and he also catalogued the rocks, birds and wild flowers of the island. In 1885 he published the book Text Book of Newfoundland History. His best-known and most prominent book was Newfoundland, The Oldest British Colony which he co- authored with Joseph Hatton and published in 1883. In 1886, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and of the Royal Society of Canada in 1891. Harvey was awarded the honorary degree of LL.D. from McGill University in 1891.

Now based in Portland, Oregon, the orchestra's origin dates back to 1910, when music teacher Mary V. Dodge began playing music for local children in Burns, Oregon. Dodge purchased instruments for the children and organized the orchestra, which would become known as the Sagebrush Symphony Orchestra. After touring the state, including a performance at the Oregon State Fair in Salem, the orchestra disbanded in 1918 when Dodge moved to Portland. There, Dodge opened a violin school and became music director of the Irvington School Orchestra. Hoping to create a permanent youth symphony, Dodge approached Jacques Gershkovitch in 1924 to serve as music director of the Portland Junior Symphony. The ensemble performed for the first time in 1925, and by the 1930s, PJS concerts were being broadcast nationally. Following Gershkovitch's death in 1953, alumnus Jacob Avshalomov became the orchestra's music director. The ensemble's name was changed to the Portland Youth Philharmonic in 1978. The PYP has had five conductors and music directors during its history: Gershkovitch (1924–1953), Avshalomov (1954–1995), Huw Edwards (1995–2002), Mei-Ann Chen (2002–2007), and professional clarinetist David Hattner (2008–present). The PYP's umbrella organization, the Portland Youth Philharmonic Association, consists of four ensembles, including the Philharmonic Orchestra, the Conservatory Orchestra, the Wind Ensemble, and the Young String Ensemble. Participating musicians range in age from seven to twenty-two years and attend dozens of schools within the Portland metropolitan area and surrounding communities. History =Mary V. Dodge and the Sagebrush Symphony Orchestra= Fourth of July float in Burns in 1915 Sagebrush Symphony in 1916 Mary V. Dodge (birth name Mary B. Thompson) was born in Arkansas in 1876. When she was five years old, her father died, causing her and her sisters to be placed in an orphanage while their mother finished nursing school. Mary Thompson became interested in music while attending a Catholic boarding school, and later became a musician and teacher in Boston and New York City. After moving to Portland, Oregon, where her aunt owned a boarding house, she met and married civil engineer and double bass player Mott Dodge. Soon after they married, Mott was transferred to Harney County for a work project. In 1910, they settled in Burns in an engineering camp known as the \\"Boston tents\\". Mary and Mott had one child, Glen, who learned from his mother how to play the fiddle starting at a young age. A classically trained violinist with a \\"love of children and ... a deeply democratic view about making music\\", Dodge began teaching local children how to play string instruments, first in resident tents then in a photography studio. With assistance from parents and a professional flautist from Italy, who taught the children how to play wind instruments and conducted, Dodge assembled a small orchestra. According to former violin student Ruth Saunders, \\"All of the sighing, tooting and drumming soon made the citizens aware that something was going on, and due to her powers of persuasion, they found themselves devoting their time, talents, money and children to the creation of the Sagebrush Orchestra.\\" The orchestra's first concert was held in 1912 at Tonawama Hall in Burns. With funds provided by rancher Bill Hanley, lawyer and artist Charles Erskine Scott Wood, and additional Burns businessmen, Dodge purchased musical instruments for the children and expanded the orchestra to between thirty and thirty-five members. By 1915, the orchestra was touring throughout eastern Oregon on a Chautauqua circuit. With $2,000 in funds raised by the aforementioned businessmen, the ensemble visited western Oregon in September 1916 and performed seven concerts in a two-day period. By that point known as the Sagebrush Symphony Orchestra, the ensemble won $100 at the Oregon State Fair in Salem and performed several concerts in Portland, including one at the Imperial Hotel and one for opera singer Ernestine Schumann-Heink at the Portland Hotel. During the symphony's week-long tour, one Oregonian reporter wrote: \\"The journey of the little people is considered one of the finest exhibitions of community spirit ever shown in this state.\\" Schumann-Heink planned to support the orchestra's efforts to tour, and promised to host a benefit concert the following year. However, the nation's involvement in World War I interrupted plans for additional tours. The orchestra disbanded in 1918 when Dodge relocated to Portland. =Establishment of the Portland Junior Symphony= Mary Dodge initially returned to Portland with her husband when he was transferred there for work, but when his job fell through, the couple separated and Mary remained in Portland. Now a single woman, Dodge changed her name to Mary V. Dodge, with the \\"V\\" standing for \\"violin\\". She opened a violin school and became music director of the Irvington Grade School orchestra. With the hope of creating a permanent youth symphony, Dodge began hosting rehearsals in her attic. However, due to gender inequality in the United States at the time, Dodge knew that a professional male conductor would need to lead the orchestra. Dodge approached Jacques Gershkovitch, a Russian immigrant in Portland who was guest conductor for the Portland Symphony (which would later become the Oregon Symphony), after seeing him conduct. Though Gershkovitch first explained that he did not teach children, Dodge insisted that he listen to the youth ensemble she had assembled. One orchestra member recalled: \\"I well remember the excitement of that night when Gershkovitch climbed the stairs to Mary Dodge's attic, where we had assembled to play for him. He listened as we played our hearts out. He applauded us and said that if we got the missing instruments, he would take us on.\\" In an attempt to hand over the baton to Gershkovitch, he simply said to Dodge, \\"I take.\\" Initially, Dodge remained as associate director of the orchestra; she also assisted with sectional rehearsals, appointed a board of directors, and renamed the ensemble to the Portland Junior Symphony Orchestra in 1924. The original board of directors established the mission of the orchestra: \\"to encourage appreciation and rendition of orchestral music by young people, to give public symphonic and popular concerts, to discover and develop latent talent among the children of Portland\\". Six years later, the orchestra was financially sound, and Dodge resigned to focus on teaching. She also became increasingly dedicated to a scientific approach to bowing. Dodge died in 1954. =Jacques Gershkovitch (1924–1953)= Jacques Gershkovitch Born in 1884 to a Jewish family in Irkutsk, Russia, Gershkovitch grew up listening to chamber music and was sent to Saint Petersburg in his late teens to study at the Imperial Conservatory. Gershkovitch arrived with \\"17 rubles in his pocket and his flute under his arm\\"; he auditioned and was awarded a scholarship. At the Conservatory, he learned from respected Russian composers such as Alexander Glazunov, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Nikolai Tcherepnin, and completed coursework in opera and ballet production. In 1913, he graduated with honors in flute and conducting, and was awarded the Schubert Scholarship for a year of study under German conductor Arthur Nikisch in Berlin. However, World War I forced Gershkovitch to return to Irkutsk and enlist in the military. Gershkovitch began his conducting career as head of the Imperial Russian Army's military symphony orchestra, a position he held through the 1917 revolution. In 1918, Gershkovitch married in Irkutsk and established a successful fine arts conservatory and symphony orchestra, which continued under the Bolshevik regime. Gershkovitch and his wife left Russia in 1921 for China, where they befriended composer Aaron Avshalomov. Ballerina Anna Pavlova offered Gershkovitch an assistant conductor position with her orchestra, which was touring throughout the Orient. Gershkovitch settled in Tokyo to lead the newly organized Tokyo Symphony Orchestra until the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923 \\"disorganized all the business and musical interests of the city\\". The couple fled Japan and arrived in San Francisco in November 1923. They eventually made their way to Portland in 1924; it was here that Gershkovitch was approached by Dodge to lead the Portland Junior Symphony. Gershkovitch taught flute and conducted the Ellison-White Conservatory's student orchestra, at the time directed by Jacob Avshalomov, until his new PJS duties required his full attention. Lincoln High School (pictured c. 1920) The symphony performed for the first time on February 14, 1925, at Portland's Lincoln High School Auditorium (which later became Portland State University's Lincoln Hall), performing Schubert's Unfinished Symphony. At the ensemble's first rehearsal, Gershkovitch introduced the composition and said, \\"You play, or I keel you\\", in his heavy Russian accent. Concert attendees reportedly rushed the stage after the debut concert to congratulate the musicians, Gershkovitch and Dodge, who was present and was called to the stage. One reviewer for the Oregon Sunday Journal wrote the following day that the \\"audience that almost filled the auditorium to capacity broke into storm upon storm of applause\\". According to Ronald Russell, author of A New West to Explore (1938), the audience \\"had experienced a new emotional thrill, and forthwith became strong advocates and supporters of the junior symphony cause.\\" In spring 1925, the orchestra gained national attention by performing at the convention of the National Federation of Music Clubs in Portland. The Sunday Oregonian reported that convention attendees were \\"so deeply impressed that they declared it unhesitatingly the most wonderful organization of its kind in the entire country\\". The symphony's second season premiered to a capacity audience on November 25, 1925, with the 75-member ensemble performing Mozart's Symphony No. 40 in its entirety along with \\"In the Village\\" from Ippolitov-Ivanov's Caucasian Sketches, the waltz from Rebikov's The Christmas Tree and the march from Wagner's opera Tannhäuser. Early in the organization's history, the Portland Junior Symphony consisted of a full symphony orchestra, a choir, and a ballet unit. According to Wither Youth (1935), approximately 350 young artists participated in these groups each season (about 100 in the orchestra, 150 in the chorus, and 100 in the ballet). Membership was granted on \\"merit, ability, seriousness and interest\\", and there were no tuition fees for participation (this has since changed). Orchestra members were also encouraged to take private lessons. The minimum schedule for participants included two rehearsals during each week of the eight-month season, along with dress rehearsals prior to performances. Three or four concerts were presented each season, many at Portland Public Auditorium (now known as Keller Auditorium). The organization was sustained financially through concert admission and donations—instruments, funds towards scholarships and the general endowment, and music for the association's library were also accepted to ensure the symphony's continued viability. Gershkovitch, known for his discipline and high performance standards, conducted the orchestra for 29 years, gaining national attention for the ensemble and pioneering the youth orchestra movement. By the 1930s, PJS concerts were broadcast nationally on the CBS Radio Network. In 1956 and 1958, both NBC and CBS transmitted broadcasts of the orchestra's programs across the United States, and three transcribed programs were broadcast overseas by Voice of America. Gershkovitch was also responsible for adding a Preparatory Orchestra (later renamed the Conservatory Orchestra) due to increased membership. Gershkovitch tried to incorporate at least one American composition in each concert. He had a distinctive personality and way with words, using expressions (recollected in one former student's diary) such as \\"More nicely, can't you more?\\" and \\"Debussy is beauty, French beauty\\". For 25 years, David Campbell served as Master of Ceremonies for the Children's Concerts, since Gershkovitch \\"never gained a command of English sufficient enough for public use\\". Gershkovitch's often-quoted philosophy was that he did \\"not teach music\\", but rather he taught \\"young people through music\\". Though there were times when he also wished to conduct professional ensembles, Gershkovitch's primary concern was educating the youth. Apart from music education, Gershkovitch stressed the importance of proper conduct, manners, and \\"values in life and art\\" as ways to build character. Following Gershkovitch's death in 1953, guest conductors led the orchestra for its 30th season—one conductor was Jacob Avshalomov, a Columbia University teacher and PJS alumnus who had studied under Gershkovitch while a student at Reed College from 1939 to 1941. =Jacob Avshalomov (1954–1995)= Jacob Avshalomov was born on March 28, 1919, in Tsingtao, China. Note: Profile by David Campbell. His father was Aaron Avshalomov, the Siberian-born composer known for \\"oriental musical materials cast in western forms and media\\", and mother was from San Francisco. Jacob received musical instruction from his father at a young age. At age eight, Avshalomov visited Portland from China with his parents, who were guests of Gershkovitch for several months in 1927. Note: Profile by David Campbell. Aaron Avshalomov had become friends with Gershkovitch in the Orient (when Gershkovitch and his wife met Aaron, Jacob was three years old). However, because they did not hold permanent visas, the family returned to China. Jacob graduated from British and American schools before age fifteen, then worked as a factory supervisor in Tientsin, Shanghai and Beijing over a span of four years. Avshalomov was also active in sports and won the diving championship of North China. In 1937, Avshalomov assisted his father in Shanghai with ballet production and worked on scores. He then enlisted with a British volunteer corps after Japan's invasion of China during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and eventually returned to the United States with his mother in December 1937. Avshalomov spent a year in Los Angeles, followed by two years in Portland, Oregon, and two more years at the Eastman School of Music. During World War II, he lived in London, where he conducted a performance of Johann Sebastian Bach's St John Passion. Avshalomov became the Portland Junior Symphony second orchestra conductor in 1954. During his forty- year tenure, Avshalomov produced several recordings, several of which included pieces commissioned by the orchestra, making PJS the first known recording orchestra in the Pacific Northwest. He led the ensemble on its first international tour in 1970. The orchestra became known as the Portland Youth Philharmonic in 1978. 1984 marked the orchestra's sixtieth anniversary as well as Avshalomov's thirtieth year as conductor. Avshalomov retired in 1995 after an estimated 640 concerts and 10,000 auditions. =Huw Edwards (1995–2002)= Huw Edwards, born in South Wales, moved with his parents to England and sang in choirs as a child. He witnessed his first opera, Giuseppe Verdi's Un ballo in maschera, at eleven years old when his parents took him to the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden. Just seven years later, he was on that same podium conducting W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan's operetta H.M.S. Pinafore. Edwards has been conducting since age seventeen, when he became music director of the Maidstone Opera Company in England, a position he held for six years. Edwards attended the University of Surrey, where he conducted the college orchestra, along with an ensemble that he formed on his own. At 23 years old, he won a conducting competition which sent him to the University of Surrey in England and Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. Edwards moved to the Pacific Northwest after he held a lecturer position at Northwestern University in Chicago, where he was also a doctoral candidate. Edwards become music director of the Portland Youth Philharmonic in 1995. In 1997, he was honored by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) for his programming. Edwards also made five recordings during his tenure and led the orchestra on two international tours: Canada in 1998, and Australia/New Zealand in 2000. PYP represented the United States at the Banff International Festival of Youth Orchestras in 1998. Edwards established a peer mentoring program that partnered orchestra musicians with low-income students who had little access to music education. From 1998 to 2005, he was a faculty member at the Marrowstone Music Festival. During the same period, Edwards left PYP in 2002 for a position with the Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestra, which he also held until 2005. Edwards was appointed music director of the Olympia Symphony Orchestra in 2003. =Mei-Ann Chen (2002–2007)= Native to Taiwan, Mei-Ann Chen wanted to be a conductor from the age of ten. She began playing violin and piano starting at a young age and collected batons, believing that \\"different pieces needed different kinds of batons\\". In 1989, Chen attended a concert in Taipei by the American Youth Orchestra, a touring ensemble of Boston's New England Conservatory. The day following the concert, Chen played for conductor Benjamin Zander in a closed basement hotel bar and was offered a scholarship immediately. She performed with the American Youth Orchestra for two months before being invited to attend the Walnut Hill School, a preparatory school linked to the New England Conservatory, at age sixteen. For more than three years, Chen lived with a couple in Boston she referred to as her \\"American parents\\" (Mark Churchill and Marylou Speaker Churchill; the latter was once a member of the Portland Junior Symphony). Chen continued her undergraduate and graduate work at the Conservatory and became the first person to graduate from the institution with a double master's degree in conducting and violin performance. Chen remained in Boston for nine years, then enrolled at the University of Michigan to obtain a Doctor of Musical Arts degree in conducting. Chen became PYP's fourth conductor in 2002 after being selected by a committee of \\"musically inclined\\" parents, a member of the orchestra, and representatives from the Oregon Symphony and Portland Opera. She conducted both the Philharmonic ensemble as well as the Conservatory Orchestra. During her five-year tenure with the organization, PYP debuted at Carnegie Hall, received its third ASCAP award in 2004 for innovating programming, and began collaborating with the Oregon Symphony (Chen was the ensemble's assistant conductor from 2003 to 2005) and Chamber Music Northwest. In April 2005, Chen became the first woman to win the Malko Competition, the \\"world's most prestigious prize\\" for young conductors. She also won the Taki Concordia Fellowship in 2007, an award established by Baltimore Symphony Orchestra music director Marin Alsop to support \\"promising\\" female conductors. Chen was presented the Sunburst Award by Young Audiences for her contribution to music education and was named \\"Educator of the Week\\" by KKCW. While conductor of the Philharmonic, Chen set up a box in her office so that students could leave notes for her. One musician in the orchestra felt that Chen was \\"kind of formal\\" during rehearsal but felt \\"like a big sister\\" once practice ended. Chen has been described as a \\"firecracker: small, bright and full of ka-boom\\", and her enthusiasm at times caused her to lose her breath. One board member of the organization praised Chen's attitude and felt that her lack of ego was a \\"rare quality in top symphony performers\\". Chen turned down a position with the Oregon Symphony to continue work at PYP. In 2007, she accompanied the orchestra on an international tour to Asia, where her parents saw her conduct for the first time. The Philharmonic offered a total of six performances between June 29 and July 17 in Kaohsiung, Tainan and Taipei, Taiwan, as well as in Seoul and Ulsan, South Korea. Though Chen initially thought she would remain with the Philharmonic for ten years, she left in 2007 to become assistant conductor of the Atlanta Symphony. She said of her departure: \\"The musicians at PYP have become my kids. When I look back, these five years will always be the most memorable time of my musical career.\\" Guest conductors during the 2007–2008 season included Ken Selden, director of orchestral studies at Portland State University, former Seattle Symphony conductor Alastair Willis, and former PYP conductors Huw Edwards and Chen herself. =David Hattner (2008–present)= David Hattner was chosen from a field of candidates to be the conductor and music director of PYP in 2008. A graduate of Northwestern University, Hattner was a clarinet student of Robert Marcellus. Before joining PYP, he had conducted Camerata Atlantica, the Garden State Philharmonic Orchestra and the Oklahoma Chamber Ensemble, and guest- conducted the Brooklyn Symphony Orchestra, Cincinnati Chamber Orchestra, Ensemble Sospeso, International Contemporary Ensemble and the Massapequa Philharmonic Orchestra. Hattner also participated in the American Academy of Conducting at Aspen three times, where he studied with Murry Sidlin and David Zinman. He has been the principal clarinet with the Cascade Music Festival Orchestra in Bend, the Key West Symphony Orchestra, the New Jersey Opera Theater, and the Princeton Symphony Orchestra. Hattner made his Oregon Symphony debut in January 2011. In addition to conducting and clarinet performance, Hattner has participated in live multimedia performances, accompanying silent films both nationally and internationally. PYP began offering Chamber Orchestra concerts during Hattner's tenure. Today, the Portland Youth Philharmonic consists of four ensembles: the Portland Youth Philharmonic Orchestra, the Portland Youth Conservatory Orchestra, the Portland Youth Wind Ensemble, and the Young String Ensemble. Each group is selected in open auditions in the spring and fall and is highly selective. Performances The names of Portland Youth Philharmonic's ensembles displayed on the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall's marquee, December 2011 Having previously conducted ballet repertory, Gershkovitch was approached in 1934 by Willam Christensen of the Portland Creative Theatre and School of Music, Drama, and Dance to collaborate. Gershkovitch suggested that the Portland Junior Symphony and the ballet studio perform portions of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker as part of Portland's annual Rose Festival. 5,000 spectators attended the Rose Queen coronation ceremony at Civic Auditorium to witness the production, which featured 100 ballerinas and dancers. The production was deemed a success for all involved and established Christensen as \\"Portland's leading ballet teacher\\". Gershkovitch and Christensen collaborated at the Rose Festival the following year (1935), performing Coppélia twice to enthusiastic crowds. In 1998, PYP was the sole representative of the United States at the Banff International Festival of Youth Orchestras in Canada. The orchestra's Carnegie Hall debut was in 2004. In October 2010, PYP returned to Burns, Oregon, to celebrate the centennial anniversary of the establishment of the Sagebrush Symphony. A special performance honored Mary Dodge, the history of the organization and music educators with music by Howard Hanson and Charles Ives. =International tours= PJS made its first international tour to England, Italy and Portugal in 1970. Subsequent international tours included Japan in 1979; Austria and Yugoslavia in 1984; Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany and Hungary in 1989; Japan and South Korea in 1992 and Germany in 1994. Prior to the 1984 visit to Europe, the orchestra celebrated its sixtieth anniversary by performing at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City alongside the New York Philharmonic. The concert consisted of three pieces performed by PYP and conducted by Avshalomov (\\"Dance of the Clowns\\" from Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's opera The Maid of Orleans, the first movement of Schubert's Unfinished Symphony and the fourth movement of Avshalomov's own symphony, The Oregon), a performance by the New York Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein's leadership and finally Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet conducted by Bernstein with a combined ensemble of 210 musicians. The orchestra traveled to Australia and New Zealand in 2000 under the leadership of Huw Edwards, performing Dmitri Shostakovich's Symphony No. 10. In 2007, PYP performed six concerts throughout Taiwan (in Kaohsiung, Tainan and Taipei) and South Korea (Ulsan and Seoul). Awards and recognitions In 1993, ASCAP honored PYP with its award for \\"Adventuresome Programming of Contemporary Music\\". ASCAP presented PYP with second and third awards in 1997 and 2004, respectively. In 2010, PYP received the Oregon Symphony's Patty Vemer Excellence in Music Education Award. Created in memory of Patty Vemer, once the director of music education at the Oregon Symphony, the award \\"honors those who have made significant contributions to music education and their community and who have served as an inspiration to their students\\". This marked the first year the award had been given to an organization. Alumni Notable alumni of the orchestra include Robert Mann, who helped found the Juilliard String Quartet, and Eugene Linden, founder and conductor of the Tacoma Philharmonic Orchestra. Additional students of Gershkovitch who later became professional musicians include Jesse Kregal, Marilynn (Nudelman) Kregal, Barry Lamont, Beverly LeBeck, Frederic Rothchild, Warren Signor and Jacob Avshalomov himself. Other professional musicians who were once part of the orchestra include Glenn Reeves, later a principal violist for the Oregon Symphony; Brian Hamilton, who became a cellist for the Tacoma Philharmonic Orchestra; and Marion Fox, who later joined the Oregon Symphony as a violinist. Harp player Frances Pozzi and Earl Rankin later became staff artists for KOIN and KGW, respectively.

It occurs in humans American Osteopathic College of Dermatology, \\"Discoid Lupus Erythematosus\\". and cats, more frequently occurring in dogs. It was first described in dogs by Griffin and colleagues in 1979. DLE is one form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). DLE occurs in dogs in two forms: a classical facial predominant form or generalized with other areas of the body affected. Other non-discoid variants of CLE include vesicular CLE, exfoliative CLE and mucocutaenous CLE. It does not progress to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in dogs. SLE can also have skin symptoms, but it appears that the two are either separate diseases. DLE in dogs differs from SLE in humans in that plasma cells predominate histologically instead of T lymphocytes. Because worsening of symptoms occurs with increased ultraviolet light exposure, sun exposure most likely plays a role in DLE, although certain breeds (see below) are predisposed. After pemphigus foliaceus, DLE is the second most common autoimmune skin disease in dogs. Symptoms Canine discoid lupus erythematosus showing loss of noseprint, depigmentation, ulceration and tissue destruction - all characteristic of the syndromeThe most common initial symptom is scaling and loss of pigment on the nose. The surface of the nose becomes smooth gray, and ulcerated, instead of the normal black cobblestone texture. Over time the lips, the skin around the eyes, the ears, and the genitals may become involved. Lesions may progress to ulceration and lead to tissue destruction. DLE is often worse in summer due to increased sun exposure. Diagnosis DLE is easily confused with solar dermatitis, pemphigus, ringworm, and other types of dermatitis. Biopsy is required to make the distinction. Histopathologically, there is inflammation at the dermoepidermal junction and degeneration of the basal cell layer. Unlike in SLE, an anti-nuclear antibody test is usually negative. Treatment Avoiding sun exposure and the use of sunscreens (not containing zinc oxide as this is toxic to dogs) is important. Topical therapy includes corticosteroid and tacrolimus use. Oral vitamin E or omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are also used. More refractory cases may require the use of oral niacinamide and tetracycline or immuno-suppressive medication such as corticosteroids, azathioprine, or chlorambucil. Treatment is often lifelong, but there is a good prognosis for long-term remission.

It is believed to have been composed shortly after the Natya Shastra of Bharata, and is dated between the 1stMusical Nirvana - Introduction to Indian Classical Music and 4thThe Chronology : 300AD-600AD century AD. But Bharathamuni had given reference of the treatise \\" Dattilam\\" in his celebrated work \\"Natyashastra\\"(1-26) so there is a belief that Dattilam may be a work composed before Bharata Muni. Written in 244 verses, Dattilam claims to be a synthesis of earlier works on music. The text marks the transition from the sama-gayan (ritual chants as in the Samaveda), to what is known as gandharva music, after the gandharvas, musically adept spirits who are first mentioned in the Mahabharata. Dattilam discusses scales (swara), the base note (sthana), and defines a tonal framework called grama in terms of 22 micro-tonal intervals (sruti) comprising one octave. It also discusses various arrangements of the notes (murchhana), the permutations and combinations of note-sequences (tanas), and alankara or elaboration. The melodic structure is categorized into 18 groups called jati, which are the fundamental melodic structures pre-dating the concept of the raga. The names of the jatis reflect regional origins, e.g. andhri (Andhra Pradesh), oudichya (Orissa). (Note that many modern raga names are also after regions - e.g. Khamaj, Kanada, Gauda, Multani, Jaunpuri, etc.). Ten characteristics are mentioned for each jati, which resemble the structuring and elaboration of the contemporary raga in Hindustani music. Dattila (between the 4th century BCE and the 2nd century CE) is an early Indian musicologist, who refined the melodic structures, scales and other aspects of Indian Classical Music in his work Dattilam. Nothing is known of Dattila beyond the work Dattilam. In Bharata's Natya Shastra, Bharata gives a list of a hundred sons who will put the knowledge of performances (Natyaveda) to use. One of these sons is named Dattila, p. 8; \\"Dattila was either a predecessor or a contemporary (p.115).\\" which had led to some speculation that Dattila may be a little later or contemporary to Bharata. However, today it is mostly felt, given the lack of Natyashastra elements in Dattilam, that he may have been a little earlier or a contemporary. Of course, the date of Bharata is itself not known; usually he is dated somewhere between 400BC to 200AD. References * Nijenhuis, Emmie te (1970). Dattilam: a compendium of ancient Indian music.

The trial and the appeal trial revealed that the main witness for the prosecution, convicted for the abuse, had lied about the involvement of other suspects, who were in fact innocent. Several innocent suspects had nevertheless spent years jailed on remand and one died while in prison. The trials resulted in a national outrage in France, with journalists, politicians and the public opinion questioning how such a miscarriage of justice could happen, with innocent men and women being held for years in jail on unfounded suspicions. In January 2006, a parliamentary inquiry was created, with President Jacques Chirac calling the affair a \\"judicial disaster\\". Outreau affair The \\"Outreau affair\\", which concerned an alleged criminal network in Outreau, a working class town next to Boulogne- sur-Mer in the Pas-de-Calais region, began in November 2001. The first trial took place in Saint-Omer in 2004, and the appeal took place in Paris in 2005. Seventeen people were accused. Mostly parents, they were charged with child sexual abuse and incest and their children were separated from them for much of this time. The affair began when some school teachers and social workers noticed “strange sexual behavior” from four children in a local school. Psychologists believed the children to be credible witnesses, but doctors found no evidence of sexual abuse. The parents were accused on the testimony of some of the children, which was then backed up by the confessions of some of the accused. The defendants were held in custody for from one to three years. In the first trial (in 2004), four of the eighteen admitted guilt and were convicted, while seven denied involvement and were acquitted. Six further defendants denied the charges but were convicted and given light sentences – they appealed their convictions, and were heard by the Paris Cour d'assises in autumn 2005. On the first day of the hearing, the prosecution's claims were destroyed, and all six were acquitted. Another defendant died in prison while awaiting trial. Judicial process =First trial= The trial took place before Saint-Omer's Cour d'assises, composed of three professional judges and nine jurors. The case involved an alleged ring of 17 persons, with the charges based on one woman's evidence and some corroborating statements from alleged victims. The alleged offenders were condemned on the grounds of certain adults' and, most of all, the children's testimony, together with psychiatric evidence. The children's testimony took place in \\"huis clos\\" (behind closed doors); such a procedure is normal in France for victims of sexual abuse, especially minors. The six convicted persons who denied any responsibility appealed their convictions. The woman who had given much of the evidence later confessed in court she had lied, and the children's revelations were found to be unreliable. Only four of the accused ever confessed, all the others insisted on their innocence: one died in jail during the investigation, 7 others were acquitted during the first trial in May 2004, the last 6 during the second trial on the evening of December 1, 2005. =Second trial= The appeal took place before Paris' Cour d'assises, composed of three professional judges and twelve jurors, used as an appellate court for review of both facts and law. On its first day, the prosecution's claims were dismissed, owing to the statement of the main prosecution witness, Myriam Badaoui, who had declared on November 18 that the six convicted persons \\"had not done anything\\" and that she had herself lied. Thierry Delay, her former husband, backed up her statement. During the trial, the psychological evidence was also called into question, as it appeared biased and lacking in weight. The denials of two children, who admitted that they had formerly lied, also contributed to the destruction of the prosecution's claims. One of the psychologists said on TV: \\"I am paid the same as a cleaning lady, so I provide a cleaning lady's expertise,\\" which caused further public indignation. At the end of the trial, the prosecutor (avocat général) asked for the acquittal of all of the accused persons. The defence renounced its right to plead, preferring to observe a minute of silence in favor of François Mourmand, who had died in prison during remand. Yves Bot, general prosecutor of Paris, came to the trial on its last day, without previously notifying the president of the Cour d'assises, Mrs. Mondineu-Hederer; while there, Bot presented his apologies to the defendants on behalf of the legal system--he did this before the verdict was delivered, taking for granted a \\"not guilty\\" ruling, for which some magistrates reproached him afterwards. All six defendants were finally acquitted on December 1, 2005, putting an end to five years of trials, which have been described by the French media as a \\"judicial foundering\\" or even as a \\"judicial Chernobyl\\". =Remaining sentences= Four people remained convicted after the appeal trial: Myriam Badaoui (who had not appealed her conviction), her husband, and a couple of neighbours. Myriam Badaoui, her husband, and one of the neighbours confessed that they had wrongfully accused other people to have been involved in the abuse cases, whereas only the four of them had been involved. Myriam Badaoui was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison, her husband to 20 years. Myriam Badoui was freed in 2015. Aftermath =Questioning on French justice and media involvement= The affair caused public indignation and questions about the general workings of justice in France. The role of an inexperienced magistrate, Fabrice Burgaud,\\"Paedophile case that could bring down the Napoleonic system\\", Adam Sage, The Times, 2006-04-04 fresh out of the Ecole Nationale de la Magistrature was underscored, as well as the undue weight given to children's words and to psychiatric expertise, both of which were revealed to have been wrong. The media's relation of the events was also questioned; although they were quick to point out the judicial error, they also had previously endorsed the \\"Outreau affair\\". =Parliamentary inquiry= After the second trial, the Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, the minister of justice Pascal Clément and President Chirac himself officially apologised to the victims in the name of the government and of the judicial institutions. In January 2006, there was a special parliamentary enquiry (for the first time broadcast live on television) about this catastrophe judiciaire (judicial disaster), which had been called by President Chirac in order to help prevent a recurrence of this situation through alterations in France's legal system. The role of experts (who had drawn hasty conclusions from children's testimony) and child protection advocates, lack of legal representation, the responsibility of the judges (the prosecution's case depended in this instance on a single investigative magistrate) and the role of the mass media were examined. The acquitted persons' hearing by the parliamentary enquiry caused a surge of emotion through the whole country. The affair was designated a \\"judiciary shipwreck\\". =Fabrice Burgaud= On April 24, 2009, the Conseil supérieur de la magistrature sentenced Burgaud to a reprimand (réprimande avec inscription au dossier), the lowest disciplinary penalty in the French judiciary system.

It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. It is known by the following brand names: Azepamid, Nobrium, Tranquirax (mixed with bevonium), Rudotel, Raporan, Ansilan and Mezapam. Medazepam is a long- acting benzodiazepine drug. The half-life of medazepam is 36–200 hours. Pharmacology Medazepam acts as a prodrug to diazepam, as well as nordazepam, temazepam and oxazepam. Benzodiazepine drugs including medazepam increase the inhibitory processes in the cerebral cortex by allosteric modulation of the GABA receptor. Benzodiazepines may also act via micromolar benzodiazepine-binding sites as Ca2+ channel blockers and significantly inhibited depolarization-sensitive calcium uptake in experiments with cell components from rat brains. This has been conjectured as a mechanism for high dose effects against seizures in a study. It has major active benzodiazepine metabolites, which gives it a more prolonged therapeutic effects after administration.

It is the easternmost part of the Kingdom of Norway. The closest Russian Arctic possession, Victoria Island, lies only to the east of Kvitøya. Map including Kvitøya The island is almost completely covered by Kvitøyjøkulen, an ice cap with an area of with a classical, hourglass-shaped dome, which has given it its name. The few ice-free land areas are each only a few square kilometres large and very barren and rocky, the largest being Andréeneset on the southwest corner of the island. Kvitøya is a part of the Nordaust-Svalbard Nature Reserve. Kvitøya was discovered by the Dutchman Cornelis Giles in 1707, and it was seen under the name 'Giles Land' on maps in different shapes, sizes and positions throughout the centuries. The present name was given by whaler Johan Kjeldsen of Tromsø in 1876. The island was the resting place of the Andrée's Arctic balloon expedition of 1897, organised by S. A. Andrée. The expedition had attempted to overfly the North Pole in a hydrogen balloon, but was forced down on the pack ice about north of Kvitøya on July 14, less than three days after their launch. They reached the island on foot by October 6 and settled on the only ice free part on the island, on what is now called Andréeneset. The fate of the expedition for many years was one of the great mysteries of the Arctic, until its remains were discovered by the ship Bratvaag in 1930, over thirty years later, and diaries, logs of scientific observations and photographs—glass negative plates, which had been deep frozen and could be developed—were recovered at the site. Modern researchers hold that the three members of the expedition died within two weeks of reaching the island. A monument commemorating the three men, S. A. Andrée, Nils Strindberg and Knut Frænkel is erected on the island. Another monument, put there by the \\"Stockholm expedition\\" in 1997 to commemorate the 100 years anniversary of the tragic event, was later deliberately destroyed by the Svalbard authority, on the ground of it being illegally erected. Etymology The original spelling of the name from 1876 was Hvidøen (Danish–Norwegian). In 1927, it was changed to Kvitøya. Like other names in the Norwegian Arctic and Antarctic islands and areas the Nynorsk form of Norwegian is used in the name – the Bokmål form would have been Hvitøyen or Hvitøya.

It stands on the site of the first Chinese public school, built in 143–141 BC by the Han dynasty governor Wén Wēng (文翁). It was originally constructed in stone, hence the name Shishi (石室), or stone chamber. The school is also known as Wenweng Shishi (), the \\"Stone Chamber of Wen Weng\\". History Between the years 143 and 141 BC, Wén Wēng (文翁), the Western Han dynasty governor of Shu Commandery (modern Sichuan), established the first Chinese public school, Shujun Junxue (Shu Commandery Academy, 蜀郡郡学). The great Han dynasty scholar Sima Xiangru studied at the school. During the Eastern Han Dynasty, the school was devastated by fire. It was rebuilt in 199 AD, and continued through China's imperial dynasties as Yizhou Zhouxue (益州州学, Yizhou Prefecture School), Chengdu Fuxue (Chengdu Prefecture Academy, 成都府学) and other names. Shu Shi Jing (a form of Thirteen Classics, literally Shu Carved Stone of Classics, 蜀石经) was completed in Chengdu Fuxue in Northern Song after more than 230 years intermittent carving. In the 17th century, as the Ming dynasty collapsed, Zhang Xianzhong's rebel force devastated Sichuan and the school was destroyed. In 1661, early in the Qing Dynasty, the Chengdu Fuxue (prefecture school of Chengdu) was reestablished on the site, and became a leading school in Sichuan. Jinjiang Academy, which later became Sichuan University, was established at the school in 1740. Chengdu Fuxue became Chengdu Normal School (成都师范学堂) under the new educational system introduced in 1902 and then became Chengdu Middle School (成都府中学堂) in 1904. It was renamed again to Chengdu Shishi Middle School (成都石室中学) in February 1940, and in mid-1948 was identified as a model for secondary schools nationwide. In September 1952, after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the school changed its name to Chengdu No. 4 Middle School (成都第四中学). During the Cultural Revolution the school was devastated for the third time; none of the Qing Dynasty buildings still exist. It returned to its former name in April 1983. Shishi ranks among the top 100 high schools in China. Its admission is highly selective, and attracts applications each year from both local and neighboring middle schools. Most Shishi students scored among the top 10% of their peers on the junior middle school exit exam.

Established in 1947, BVC merged with a competitor in 1974. Operational and Legal Structure BVC is a private exchange, providing operations for the purchase and authorized sale of securities according to the Capital Marketing Laws of Venezuela. It is member of the Executive Committee of the Latin American Federation of Stock markets. At the exchange, companies emit by procedures authorized by the regulating authorities, instruments of fixed income and securities (renta fija y de renta variable) with the purpose of securing capital from public investors. BVC is also used as a location for trading in Bonds and other debt instruments. The legal structure prevailing in the Venezuelan capital market are the Securities Marketing Law (la Ley de Mercado de Capitales, enacted in 1975 and amended in 1998), Transaction Law (Ley de Caja de Valores), the Statutory Law of Public Credit (Ley Orgánica de Crédito Público), the Law of Organizations of Collective Investment and the norms dictated by the National Exchange Commission (Comisión Nacional de Valores, or CNV). Exchange activities are regulated and supervised by the National Exchange Commission, a public entity assigned to the Ministry of Finance, that authorizes internal procedures and regulations. =Board of Directors= The Board of Directors of the Caracas Stock Exchange is presided over by Víctor Julio Flores. Additional members include Santiago Fernández Castro, Marcel Apeloig, Omar Delgado, José Gregorio Castro, Gabriel Osío, Jesús Tadeo Prato, Luis Oberto, Carlos Fernández and Mario Dickson, as well as by advisers Luis Andrés Guerrero and Rubén Manzur. History and Performance The origins of the Venezuelan stock market can be traced to the end of the colonial era, when in 1805 Don Bruno Abasolo and Don Fernando Key Muñoz founded the Casa de Bolsa y Recreación de los Comerciantes y Labradores in Caracas. The exchange was officially founded on January 21, 1947 and inaugurated its first trading session on April 21 of the same year, after previously trading stocks over the counter. On May 6, 1976, the assembly of shareholders decided to change the denomination of the institution to Bolsa de Valores de Caracas C.A., and initiated a new operating structure composed of 43 shareholders, or puestos de bolsa, an amount that would be increased to 63 members in 1995. =Performance= In 1990, with an increase of 602%, the market was the second-best performing that year (after Poland). In April 2007, 60 companies were listed on the BVC, with less than half being traded regularly. BVC experienced a severe decline in traded volumes since the mid-1990s as a result of a declining economy, the migration of stocks to the U.S. markets in the form of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), corporate takeovers with a concomitant reduction in the number of shares available for trade and an increasing country risk that has frightened investors, particularly foreign investors. Daily trading volume decreased from the equivalent of $25 to $30 million in 1997 to less than $1 million by 2000.Garay U., El Mercado Bursatil Venezolano: Evolucion y Perpectivas, Debates IESA 2001 The BVC survived during this period thanks to a growing trade of government debt securities. Stock prices, measured by the Indice Bursátil Caracas, were also depressed during the 1990s and have yet to recover to the highest ever levels experienced in 1991. According to the International Finance Corporation, the market value of the BVC was $7 billion in 2000, or just about 6 percent of GDP.Urbi Garay & Maximiliano Gonzalez, CEO and Director Turnover in Venezuela, Inter-American Development Bank In 2005 total transactions on the BVC totaled USD$ 438 million. Electronic Exchange BVC has been completely electronic since February 1992, when a modern electronic trading system developed by the Vancouver Stock Exchange entered operations.

It was signed on 28 June 1919 as Part I of the Treaty of Versailles, and became effective together with the rest of the Treaty on 10 January 1920. Creation Early drafts for a possible League of Nations began even before the end of the First World War. The London-based Bryce Group made proposals adopted by the British League of Nations Society, founded in 1915. Another group in the United States—which included Hamilton Holt and William B. Howland at the Century Association in New York City—had their own plan. This plan was largely supported by the League to Enforce Peace, an organization led by former U.S. President William Howard Taft. In December 1916, Lord Robert Cecil suggested that an official committee be set up to draft a covenant for a future league. The British committee was finally appointed in February 1918; it was led by Walter Phillimore (and became known as the Phillimore Committee) but also included Eyre Crowe, William Tyrrell, and Cecil Hurst. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson was not impressed with the Phillimore Committee's report, and would eventually produce three draft covenants of his own with help from his friend Colonel House. Further suggestions were made by Jan Christiaan Smuts in December 1918. At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, a commission was appointed to agree on a covenant. Members included Woodrow Wilson (as chair), Colonel House (representing the U.S.), Robert Cecil and Jan Smuts (British Empire), Léon Bourgeois and Ferdinand Larnaude (France), Prime Minister Vittorio Orlando and Vittorio Scialoja (Italy), Foreign Minister Makino Nobuaki and Chinda Sutemi (Japan), Paul Hymans (Belgium), Epitácio Pessoa (Brazil), Wellington Koo (China), Jayme Batalha Reis (Portugal), and Milenko Radomar Vesnitch (Serbia). Further representatives of Czechoslovakia, Greece, Poland and Romania were later added. The group considered a preliminary draft co-written by Hurst and President Wilson's adviser David Hunter Miller. During the first four months of 1919 the group met on ten separate occasions, attempting to negotiate the exact terms of the foundational Covenant agreement for the future League. During the ensuing negotiations various major objections arose from various countries. France wanted the League to form an international army to enforce its decisions, but the British worried such an army would be dominated by the French, and the Americans could not agree as only Congress could declare war. Japan requested that a clause upholding the principle of racial equality should be inserted, parallel to the existing religious equality clause. This was deeply opposed, particularly by American political sentiment, while Wilson himself simply ignored the question. During a certain interval while Wilson was away, the question of international equality was raised once again. A vote on a motion supporting the \\"equality of nations and the just treatment of their nationals\\" was made, and was supported by 11 of the 19 delegates. Upon Wilson's return he declared that \\"serious objections\\" by other delegates had negated the majority vote, and the amendment was dismissed. Finally on April 11, 1919, the revised Hurst-Miller draft was approved, but without fully resolving certain questions as had been brought forth regarding matters such as national equality, racial equality, and how the new League might be able to practically enforce its various mandates. The new League would include a General Assembly (representing all member states), an Executive Council (with membership limited to major powers), and a permanent secretariat. Member states were expected to \\"respect and preserve as against external aggression\\" the territorial integrity of other members, and to disarm \\"to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety\\". All states were required to submit complaints for arbitration or judicial inquiry before going to war. The Executive Council would create a Permanent Court of International Justice to make judgements on the disputes. The treaty entered into force on 10 January 1920. Articles 4, 6, 12, 13, and 15 were amended in 1924. The treaty shares similar provisions and structures with the UN Charter.League of Nations Covenant and United Nations Charter: A Side-by-Side (Full Text) Comparison by Walter Dorn Article X Article X of the Covenant of the League of Nations is the section calling for assistance to be given to a member that experiences external aggression. It was signed by the major Peacemakers (Allied Forces) following the First World War, most notably Britain and France. Due to the nature of the Article, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson was unable to ratify his obligation to join the League of Nations, as a result of strong objection from U.S. politicians. Although Wilson had secured his proposal for a League of Nations in the final draft of the Treaty of Versailles, the U.S. Senate refused to consent to the ratification of the Treaty. For many Republicans in the Senate, Article X was the most objectionable provision. Their objections were based on the fact that, by ratifying such a document, the United States would be bound by international contract to defend a League of Nations member if it was attacked. Henry Cabot Lodge from Massachusetts and Frank B. Brandegee from Connecticut led the fight in the U.S. Senate against ratification, believing that it was best not to become involved in international conflicts. Under the United States Constitution, the President of the United States may not ratify a treaty unless the Senate, by a two-thirds vote, gives its advice and consent. Article XXII Article XXII referred to the creation of Mandate territories, which were given over to be administered by European powers. Though most Mandates were given to countries such as Britain and France, which possessed considerable colonial empires, the Covenant made the clear distinction that a Mandate territory was not a colony. The Covenant asserted that such territories were \\"inhabited by peoples not yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world\\" and so \\"the tutelage of such peoples should be entrusted to advanced nations who by reason of their resources, their experience or their geographical position can best undertake this responsibility\\" as a \\"a sacred trust of civilization\\". Mandate territories were sorted into several sub-categories: * \\"Communities formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire\\" were considered \\"to have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations could be provisionally recognized\\" and the Mandatory powers were charged with \\"rendering administrative advice and assistance until such time as they are able to stand alone\\". * Regarding \\"Other peoples, especially those of Central Africa\\" the Mandatory powers were charged to \\"guarantee freedom of conscience and religion, subject only to the maintenance of public order and morals, the prohibition of abuses such as the slave trade, the arms traffic and the liquor traffic, and the prevention of the establishment of fortifications or military and naval bases and of military training of the natives for other than police purposes and the defence of territory\\", and no mention was made of any eventual independence. * With regard to \\"Territories, such as South-West Africa and certain of the South Pacific Islands\\", they were assumed \\"owing to the sparseness of their population, or their small size, or their remoteness from the centres of civilisation, or their geographical contiguity to the territory of the Mandatory, and other circumstances\\" to be \\"best administered under the laws of the Mandatory as integral portions of its territory, subject to the safeguards above mentioned in the interests of the indigenous population\\". The reference to \\"geographical contiguity to the territory of the Mandatory\\" clearly related to South-West Africa (now Namibia) being made a Mandate of South Africa, rather than of Britain.

It rises in two forks merging near Toutle below Mount St. Helens and joins the Cowlitz near Castle Rock, upstream of the larger river's confluence with the Columbia River. River miles are marked and numbered on the relevant map quadrangles. The river was altered by the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, a nearby volcano, and subsequent flows of ash and other debris. It was further altered by dredging to remove sediment, and by construction of the Toutle River Sediment Retention Structure on the North Fork Toutle River. Course The Toutle River begins at the confluence of the North Fork Toutle River and the South Fork Toutle River near the community of Toutle. The forks originate on Mount St. Helens in Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument, and flow generally west to form the main stem, which continues generally west, with significant north-south deviations. The town of Toutle lies to the left of the river at river mile (RM) 17.2 or river kilometer (RK) 27.7. At first the Toutle River flows north for about along the base of Beigle Mountain, which is on its right. The river continues generally north until, at about RM 13 (RK 21), it begins a sweeping turn to the southwest. For the next several miles, Tower Road runs along the right bank of the river, and at about RM 10 (RK 16) Tower Cemetery is on the right. Downstream of the cemetery, the river passes through Hollywood Gorge, where Rock Creek enters from the right. The river continues southwest through RM 7 (RK 11), where it receives Stankey Creek from the left. The Toutle River then turns west, passing under Tower Road and receiving Cline Creek from the right. Over the next stretch, Burma Road is on the right. Over its final , the Toutle meanders generally southwest through large deposits of sand. The stream passes under Barnes Drive and then Interstate 5 before entering the Cowlitz River about upstream from the city of Castle Rock. Below the confluence, the Cowlitz continues for , entering the Columbia River about from its mouth on the Pacific Ocean. =Discharge= The United States Geological Survey monitors the flow of the Toutle River at a stream gauge at RM 6.5 (RK 10.5). The average flow of the river is . This is from a drainage area of , about 81 percent of the total Toutle River watershed. The maximum flow recorded there was on Feb. 8, 1996, and the minimum flow was on Oct. 14, 1987. This data covers a 30-year period that began in 1981, after the volcanic eruption. Extremes outside the period of record include two large floods on May 18, 1980, related to volcanic mud flows that came down the South Fork and then the North Fork, spaced nine hours apart. Volcanic sediment The eruption of Mount St. Helens and subsequent lahars poured vast amounts of sediment into the Toutle. The United States Army Corps of Engineers dredged sediment from the river and built the $65 million Toutle River Sediment Retention Structure on the North Fork Toutle River to prevent debris from continuing downstream. Part of the same engineering works is a tunnel to drain Spirit Lake, on the north side of the volcano, after the eruption blocked the lake's natural outlet.

Joshua Glover was a fugitive slave from St. Louis, Missouri who sought asylum in Racine, Wisconsin in 1852. Upon learning his whereabouts in 1854, slave owner Bennami Garland attempted to use the Fugitive Slave Act to recover him. Glover was captured and taken to a Milwaukee jail. On March 18, 1854 a mob incited by Sherman Booth broke into the jail and rescued Glover, who was taken secretly to Port Washington, Wisconsin, from where he traveled by boat to Canada. The rescue of Glover and the federal government's subsequent attempt to prosecute Booth helped to galvanize the abolitionist movement in the state that eventually led to Wisconsin becoming the only state to declare the act unconstitutional.Wisconsin Historical Society.

The band's name comes from a corruption of ' (naked suitcases) (literal translation) which was derived from a fake French slang invented with the theatrical group Gendai Gekijo. The band's style is typified by simple, repetitious instrumental passages, shrieking, cacophonous guitar feedback and folk arrangement. Their discography is made up mostly of live bootlegs, soundboard archives and even a few rare aborted studio recording attempts as they have never officially released any of their own material, although there are archive releases on independent labels such as Univive, Rivista, Phoenix and Bamboo.  History  Much of Les Rallizes Dénudés' history remains largely shrouded in mystery and nearly nothing is known about their highly enigmatic frontman Takashi Mizutani. A few very sparse first person accounts and documentation describe Mizutani as an extremely introverted and reclusive individual with very nihilistic and solipsistic views on life. It is also evident that he had very radical leftist views and supported the Japanese Red Army. Les Rallizes Dénudés emerged from the late '60s underground rock scene that was forming in the Kyoto commune scene. Other notable groups to emerge from this scene were The Taj Mahal Travellers, The Ubiquitous Acid 7 group and Masato Minami. The earliest recordings of Les Rallizes Dénudés date back to an abandoned studio session recorded some time in either late 1967 or early 1968. Supposedly, Mizutani was so dissatisfied with the sound of the recordings that he decided to completely abandon the idea of recording studio material. After that point, he made very rare studio visits making another unsuccessful studio recording attempt in 1980. Some of the more notable recordings from the 1967–68 recording are \\"Otherwise My Conviction\\" and another track which roughly translates to either \\"Birdsong\\" or \\"Cry of a Bird\\". The latter of the two recordings was recycled often in their live sets. Later in 1968 they performed a live track that has gained some recognition as their first real foray into noise, the nearly 20-minute long \\"Smokin Cigarette Blues\\". Although poorly recorded, the recording is considered to be very important in the development of noise rock. Their live performances originally accompanied performances by avant-garde theater groups (such as Shuji Terayama's troupe). Their performances were quickly deemed too loud and intense to back a theater performance, as it would be too distracting. One of their earliest and most infamous performances at Kyoto University during the student protests that were going on at the time. This particular concert was dubbed \\"Barricades-A-Go-Go\\". A posthumous compilation entitled \\"'67–'69 Studio Et Live\\" contains a recording of a live performance which may have been from that event. Mizutani was known to be a fan of the Velvet Underground and took influence from their second album White Light/White Heat in order to craft his own sound for his band. In 1970, the original bass player Moriaki Wakabayashi assisted in the hijacking of Japan Airlines Flight 351 orchestrated by the Japanese Red Army. Wakabayashi has been living in North Korea since the hijacking. Mizutani was allegedly offered a role in the hijacking, but turned it down. After this event, however, a paranoid Mizutani kept a low profile due to his ties with the Red Army, which he would supposedly cut in the early to mid 70s to avoid government scrutiny, although it remains unknown whether he was ever affiliated with the Red Army at all. In 1973, they would appear on a limited-edition live compilation \\"Oz Days Live\\", which was one of only two released recordings by the group that documented their current sound at the time, the other being \\"Eve Night\\" from 1983. The period from 1977 to 1982 is considered by most to be their prime, as their most well received recording is of a live performance from 1977. In the early '80s, there was a drastic change in sound within the band as Mizutani had hired more musically competent musicians and replaced the rhythm guitarist with second lead guitarist Fujio Yamaguchi, whose much more bluesy and melodic delivery added tone color to the group that hadn't been heard before. This time period is documented on \\"Double Heads\\", a comprehensive six-disc box set that documents three separate concerts from 1980 to 1981. In mid-1981, Yamaguchi left the group which was now downsized to a trio, which they would stay for the most part until they would break up in 1996. At this point their sound was much more sparse and atonal, as the bass was the sole melodic instrument in the group. Their mid-’80s to mid-’90s sound bears many similarities to Ornette Coleman's mid-'60s work with his trio. After 1987, for unknown reasons, their performances became much more sparse with most of their available ’90s recordings and film footage originating from 1993, 1994 and 1996. Their final concert was arranged under heavy secrecy, with the reason for breaking up possibly being legal reasons due to Mizutani's alleged past involvement with the Red Army. The last time any known band member has been seen in public, with the exception of former guitarist Fujio Yamaguchi (deceased) and former bassist Doronco Gumo, was in 1997 when Mizutani performed a live free jazz concert with saxophonist Arthur Doyle and drummer Sabu Toyozumi, although an unknown source claimed to have seen him sometime after the date of the concert in France. Mizutani had likely at least been alive up to 2011 due to his supposed approval of the Banzai released \\"Naked Diza Star\\" box set. It is unknown what his whereabouts are since his disappearance in 1997 or whether he is still alive. Les Rallizes Dénudés' influence likely started in the mid '70s when Keiji Haino and his band Lost Aaraaff would often play at concerts with them. Les Rallizes Dénudés can be seen as a heavy influence of Haino's later group, Fushitsusha. Fushitsusha took many of the elements from Mizutani's group and furthered them in many ways, such as incorporating more freeform group improvisation. The mid- to late-'70s underground scene of which Les Rallizes Dénudés were a part could be seen as responsible for the explosion of psychedelic and noise music that occurred in Japan in the '80s and '90s that featured more well-known acts such as Boredoms, Merzbow, Hijokaidan, Boris, Melt Banana, High Rise and Acid Mothers Temple. Les Rallizes Dénudés was also seen as an early forerunner to shoegaze, punk rock and alternative folk.

She was sunk as a target in September 1966. History Foss was named in honor of Ensign Rodney Shelton Foss (1919-1941), who was killed in action during the Japanese attack on the Hawaiian Islands. She was launched on 10 April 1943 by Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard, Hingham, Massachusetts; sponsored by Mrs. George R. Foss, mother of Ensign Foss; and commissioned on 23 July 1943, with Lieutenant Commander J. J. Jordy, USNR in command. =1943-1950= Foss sailed from Boston on 22 September 1943 for the Netherlands West Indies to escort a tanker convoy back to New York. From New York, she put to sea once more on 13 October, again with a group of tankers and, after calling at Aruba, crossed the Atlantic to Dakar, Oran and Algiers, returning by way of Aruba and the Canal Zone to New York. Between 26 December and 9 October 1944, Foss operated on the New York-Derry convoy route, making seven voyages to build up forces in Europe for the Normandy invasion and to support the advance on the continent once the landings had been made. Assigned to operational development activities in anti-submarine warfare, Foss sailed out of Washington, New London, Charleston, Norfolk, and ports in Florida during the next six years. She tested equipment for the Naval Research Laboratory and conducted operations under the direction of the Fleet Sonar School, the Anti-submarine Development Detachment, and the Operational Development Force. In 1946, she was equipped with ship/shore power conversion equipment, with which, during the winter of 1947-48, she provided Portland, Maine, with emergency electric power after normal power resources had failed because of forest fires and lack of rain. In August 1950, Foss took part in rocket experiments at Cape Canaveral, recording data after seaward firings. =1950-1957= Reassigned to the Pacific Fleet, Foss departed Norfolk on 29 September 1950, reaching San Diego on 11 October. Six days later, she sailed for duty in Korea, where her special ability to provide power to the shore was used at Chinnampo, Inchon, and Hŭngnam in November and December. She arrived at Ulsan Man on 25 December and remained until 18 August 1951, providing power for an Army unit stationed there. Returning to San Diego on 10 September, Foss served in ordnance tests until 21 September, when she raised Pearl Harbor, her new home port. During the next five years, she operated locally in the Hawaiian Islands, as well as making two cruises on surveillance patrol through the islands of the Pacific Trust Territory and two tours of duty in the Far East. During her 1955 tour, she served as station ship at Hong Kong. =Decommissioning and fate= In June 1957, Foss returned to the west coast and was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 30 October 1957. On 6 September 1966, Foss was sunk as a target by off the coast of California near San Diego. Awards Foss received one battle star for Korean War service.

While their base of operations was in Paris, the family's roots is in the Auvergne region of France. History Ennobled in 1464, the Arnauld family held many prestigious functions: Isaac Arnauld (-1561) was general of the Carabineers in the Royal Army, Simon Arnauld de Pomponne (1618-1699) was a royal ambassador and Antoine Arnauld was the royal State Counselor to King Henry IV and General Prosecutor for Queen Catherine of Medicis in 1582 The family is divided into several branches. The oldest, Arnauld de Pomponne and Arnauld d'Andilly are now extinct. Another branch of the family, divided into two sub-branches; the Arnauld de la Ronzière and Arnauld d'Artonne are still represented today. One of the most memorable figure is Antoine Arnauld (b. 1560, d. 1619 CE). Legendarily, the \\"original sin\\" that led to the Jesuits (among others) becoming bitter foes to the Arnaulds was a speech given in 1594 by Antoine (an eloquent lawyer) apologizing for the University of Paris against the Jesuits. Of Antoine's and Catherine Marion de Druy's 20 children, only ten would survive childhood- but 9 of them would become involved in the Port-Royal projects, going on variously to become poets, authors, translators, monks etc. Indeed, Marie Angélique de Sainte Madeleine, (b. 1591, d. 1661) would become an abbess of the Port-Royal Cistercian house, where she is remembered for her reforms (prompted by St. Francis de Sales). One of the aforementioned authors was Antoine Arnauld (b. 1612, d. 1694), who spent his efforts on attacking the Jesuits from his position in the Sorbonne, while his elder brother (and sister of Madeleine) Robert Arnauld d'Andilly, (b. 1588, d. 1674) spent his life at the Port-Royal translating texts and writing noted religious poetry.

After the Corps were disbanded in 1853, he worked with Colonel Joseph Anderson, Joseph Panton, Alfred Selwyn, Robert Brough Smyth and as an occasional guide for landscape painters Eugene Von Guerard, Nicholas Chevalier and later with Louis Buvelot. He was a regular guest of Lilly and Paul de Castella at Yering Station while his family took refuge upstream on the Yarra River around Woori Yallock-Launching Place. A reserve was gazetted for that site until a gold rush to Hoddles Creek in 1858. In February 1859 some Wurundjeri elders, led by Wonga (aged 35) and brother Tommy Munnering (aged 24) petitioned Protector Thomas to secure land for the Taungurong at the junction of the Acheron and Goulburn rivers. \\"I bring my friends Goulburn Blacks, they want a block of land in their country where they may sit down plant corn potatoes etc etc, and work like white man\\", he told Thomas. Initial representations to the Victorian Government were positive, however the intervention of the most powerful squatter in Victoria, Hugh Glass, resulted in their removal to a colder site, Mohican Station, which was not suitable for agricultural land and had to be abandoned. Finally in March 1863 the Kulin people suggested a traditional camping site located at Coranderrk, near Healesville and requested ownership of this land. This meeting occurred at the State Exhibition buildings during celebrations for the marriage of the Prince of Wales, and was sketched by Nicholas Chevalier and published in national newspapers. Access to the land was provided, though importantly not granted as freehold.Isabel Ellender and Peter Christiansen, pp112 People of the Merri Merri.

Her husband was the state's founding emperor, Murong Chui (Emperor Wucheng). Her given name is lost to history, but her courtesy name Yuanfei was recorded. She was the niece of two of Murong Chui's prior wives, who were daughters of the Xianbei chief Duan Mopei (段末怌). Her father Duan Yi (段儀) was a brother of the Princesses Duan. Life Murong Chui married Duan Yuanfei in or slightly earlier than 388. His younger brother Murong De married her sister Duan Jifei around the same time. He created her empress in 388 and favored her greatly. They had two sons, Murong Lang (慕容朗) the Prince of Bohai and Murong Jian (慕容鑒) the Prince of Boling. Empress Duan was described as being intelligent and a good judge of character. As she saw that Murong Chui's crown prince Murong Bao lacked governing talents, she tried to persuade him to make one of his more capable sons, Murong Nong the Prince of Liaoxi or Murong Long the Prince of Gaoyang, crown prince, but Murong Chui, believing in the flattery that Murong Bao's associates had given him, disbelieved Empress Duan and kept Murong Bao as crown prince. She had also advised him to put his treacherous son Murong Lin the Prince of Zhao to death. As a result, Murong Bao and Murong Lin greatly resented her. After Murong Chui died in 396, Murong Bao sent Murong Lin to threaten her and force her to commit suicide—stating that if she did not, he would do harm to her clan. In anger, she stated that Murong Bao would soon cause the empire's destruction, and then committed suicide. Initially, Murong Bao refused to give her an empress' burial honors, but after his official Sui Sui (眭邃) publicly articulated reasons why she should be honored, Murong Bao relented and buried her with imperial honors.

Bubble nests, also called foam nests, are created by some fish and frog species as floating masses of bubbles blown with an oral secretion, saliva bubbles, and occasionally aquatic plants. Fish that build and guard bubble nests are known as aphrophils. Aphrophils include gouramis (including Betta species) and the synbranchid eel Monopterus alba in Asia, Microctenopoma (Anabantidae), Polycentropsis (Nandidae), and Hepsetus odoe (the only member of Hepsetidae) in Africa, and callichthyines and the electric eel in South America. Most, if not all, fish that construct floating bubble nests live in tropical, oxygen- depleted standing waters. Osphronemidae, containing the Bettas and Gouramies, are the most commonly recognized family of bubble nest makers, though some members of that family mouthbrood instead. The nests are constructed as a place for fertilized eggs to be deposited while incubating and guarded by one or both parents (usually solely the male) until the fry hatch. Bubble nests can also be found in the habitats of domesticated male Betta fish. Nests found in these types of habitats indicate a healthy and happy fish. Construction and Nest Characteristics  Betta splendens builds nests of varying sizes Male Betta with Bubbles. Betta splendens fry in a bubble nest Bubble nests are built even when not in presence of female or fry (though often a female swimming past will trigger the frantic construction of the nest). Males will build bubble nests of various sizes and thicknesses, depending on the male's territory and personality. Some males build constantly, some occasionally, some when introduced to a female and some do not even begin until after spawning. Some nests will be large, some small, some thick. Nest size does not directly correlate with number of eggs. Bigger males build larger bubble nests. Large bubble nests are able to handle more eggs and larval fish and thus can only be handled by larger males. Larger males are also able to be more successful in protecting their eggs and juvenile fish from predators. Most nests are found in shallow bodies and marginal areas of water. These areas are typically slow water habitats with dense vegetation. Water in these areas is often differentiated by having a higher temperature, lower salinity, oxygen level and alkalinity (e.g. acidic). The use of shallow and marginal waters is because most larger predatory fish are more likely to be restricted to deeper waters, which helps keep the predator threat and competition low. Water temperatures in shallow water typically have a more rapid rate of change (because the infrared heat from the sun has much less effect as water levels deepen) which leads to more optimal temperatures for breeding and egg development. Warm water increases the frequency of nest building and of female spawning. The use of shallow water is also because fertilized eggs need to be aerated in order to hatch successfully. Various stimuli have been shown to affect onset the construction of Bubble Nests, such as rapid changes in temperature, barometric changes, fluctuations in rainfall, various fish tank materials, and presence of other males or females. The nests are built by the male (sometimes females) and their size, position and shape depends on the species. They are often built near an object that breaks the surface of the water, which forms a base for the nest. Bubble nests created by male Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) are made from air bubbles coated with saliva to increase durability. The creation of the bubbles is audible and often frantic. Bubble nests and breeding Males are responsible for building the nests, courting females, defending the territory and caring for the developing fish and newly hatched larval fish. Most, if not all, species of bubble nesting fish continue parental care after construction of the floating bubble nest and spawning. After spawning the eggs either float up into the bubble nest, or (in the case of sinking eggs) are carried there, and subsequently lodged into the nest by one or both parents. Following this, the male protects the brood by chasing away the female (if not a species in which the female also guards the nest) and any other intruders, concentrating on the eggs in the nest, retrieving any eggs or fry that fall from the nest and keeping the nest in repair. Only a handful of bubble nest makers (notably some snakeheads) have females participate in bubble nest maintenance. One or both parents will guard the eggs constantly until the fry hatch after 24–48 hours and be suspended from the nest. The newly hatched fry will then be tended by the parent fish until they are independent, which can take from a day to several weeks depending on the species. Frogs Several different frog clades include species that make bubble nests. Frogs use bubble nests as a form of protection for their eggs.

ASM aims to simplify the management of database datafiles, control files and log files. To do so, it provides tools to manage file systems and volumes directly inside the database, allowing database administrators (DBAs) to control volumes and disks with familiar SQL statements in standard Oracle environments. Thus DBAs do not need extra skills in specific file systems or volume managers (which usually operate at the level of the operating system).  Features  * IO channels can take advantage of data striping and software mirroring * DBAs can automate online redistribution of data, along with the addition and removal of disks/storage * the system maintains redundant copies and provides 3rd-party RAID functionality * Oracle supports third-party multipathing IO technologies (such as failover or load balancing to SAN access) * the need for hot spares diminish  Architecture overview  ASM creates extents out of datafiles, log-files, system files, control files and other database structures. The system then spreads these extents across all disks in a \\"diskgroup\\". One can think of a diskgroup in ASM as a Logical Volume Manager volume group — with an ASM file corresponding to a logical volume. In addition to the existing Oracle background processes, ASM introduces two new ones - OSMB and RBAL. OSMB opens and creates disks in a diskgroup. RBAL provides the functionality of moving data between disks in a diskgroup.  Implementation and usage  Automatic Storage Management (ASM) simplifies administration of Oracle-related files by allowing the administrator to reference disk groups (rather than individual disks and files) which ASM manages. ASM extends the Oracle Managed Files (OMF) functionality http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28310/omf.htm#i1007206 that also includes striping and mirroring to provide balanced and secure storage. DBAs can use the ASM functionality in combination with existing raw and cooked file-systems, along with OMF and manually managed files. An ASM instance controls the ASM functionality. It isn't a full database instance, it provides just the memory structures, and as such is very small and lightweight. The main components of ASM are disk groups, each of which comprise several physical disks controlled as a single unit. The physical disks are known as ASM disks, while the files that reside on the disks are known as ASM files. The locations and names for the files are controlled by ASM, but user-friendly aliases and directory structures can be defined by the DBA for ease of reference. The level of redundancy and the granularity of the striping can be controlled using templates. Oracle Corporation provides default templates for each file-type stored by ASM, but additional templates can be defined as needed. Failure groups are defined within a disk group to support the required level of redundancy. For two-way mirroring, a disk group might contain two failure groups, in which case individual files are written to two locations. Oracle ASM Dynamic Volume Manager provides the foundation for the ASM Cluster File System (ACFS). In summary, ASM provides the following functionality: * manages groups of disks, called disk groups * manages disk redundancy within each disk group * provides near-optimal I/O balancing without any manual tuning * enables management of database objects without specifying mount-points or filenames * supports large files  Redundancy  One can configure ASM diskgroups to have no redundancy (external), two-way mirroring (normal), or three-way mirroring (high). In the case of normal and high mirrors, good practice suggests having fail groups that talk to different controllers for performance and fail-safe reasons. * In the case of external redundancy, ASM does not do any software mirroring, but only stripes its files across all the disks that belong to the disk group that does external redundancy. * In the case of normal redundancy, ASM does two-way mirroring, meaning that ASM maintains two copies of the data through software mirroring. When querying for mirror information, DBAs will see two mirrors in this case. * In the case of high redundancy, ASM does three-way mirroring, maintaining three copies of the data through software mirroring. When querying for mirror information, DBAs will see three mirrors in this case.

Dimpsey originally formed the band in order to perform a 45-minute-long song that he had written. They were initially an indie rock supergroup of sorts, with a rotating cast of prominent Champaign/Chicago area musicians. They did record the 45-minute song/album with Rick Valentin (of The Poster Children) in spring 1997, but it has never been released. The band's name is apparently a reference to Bob Dylan's album Nashville Skyline, though their music betrays no stylistic debt to Dylan. The group's core members Dimpsey (bass) and Jeff Garber (singer/guitarist/songwriter) released two full-lengths, National Skyline and This = Everything, and the EP Exit Now. They also contributed the song \\"Eurorak\\" to the Parasol Records compilation Sweet Sixteen, Volume 2. Band characteristics/quirks They are known for utilizing an elaborate light show at all of their concerts. No photo of the band members has appeared in any of their albums or EP. Cover art generally consists of things such as empty buildings and blurred car lights at night; the band's artwork is always done by Ohio Girl Design. Rather than listing individual credits as all bands do, the phrase \\"Audio: National Skyline\\" is given in the liner notes of each album/EP. They generally use a drum machine instead of live drumming. The song \\"Karolina\\" was released on the self-titled album. A different, greatly extended (12+ minute) version called \\"Karolina II\\" came out on Exit Now. Touring/possible hiatus James Minor of Blacklist and Compound Red joined as a touring guitarist in 2000, joining the band as an official member before the recording of This = Everything; Dimpsey did not participate in the 2000 - 2001 touring. National Skyline has apparently not performed live since 2001. Nothing was heard from the band for five years, leading to speculation of a breakup. In June 2006, Garber leaked information about a new project on the group's MySpace site, without involvement from Dimpsey, including the new track \\"Pack Up.\\" He also launched the group's homepage—a surrealist series of cryptic images in a Flash animation, ending with a logo and the words \\"FAUX EVIL.\\" Faux Evil Twin Theory is said to be the title of their upcoming album. Before joining National Skyline, Garber was the singer for indie rock band Castor. He was also a guitarist in Year of the Rabbit and the lead singer/guitarist of post-punk influenced band The Joy Circuit. (No relation to the '80s group also named The Joy Circuit.) On September 2, 2007, the band announced that the project was permanently disbanding and some of the material intended for a full-length album would be released as The Last Day, a digital ep available on MySpace September 3 and iTunes Store and Rhapsody on September 18.National Skyline MySpace blog Garber has moved on to a solo project called The Black Swan.The Black Swan on MySpace On November 28, 2007, Garber posted a new blog on the band's MySpace site, informing visitors that 'The Last Day' was posted on iTunes after much delay and that new material was being written for a to-be-released 2008 full-length record.

The variety of Quechua spoken in the area is the Cajatambo Quechua (part of the Central Quechua \\"Wankay\\"), a Quechua I dialect which shares 74% intelligibility with the neighboring Huamalies Quechua.  Toponymy  The toponym Cajatambo comes from the Quechua words: kasha (\\"thorn\\", \\"cold\\") and tanpu (\\"inn\\").  Geography  Geographically, Cajatambo is located in the Quechua region bordering the Suni region, its climate is dry and moderately cold with the sun's rays being temperate, however the temperature drops considerably at night. Industries Near the city there are silver mines, which used to employ a section of the population. In 2002, the Peruvian government declared regions of the mountains upon which Cajatambo is located to be protected, and future mining was prohibited. Nowadays, Cajatambo's vicinity is agricultural and pastoral. It is known for its cheeses, butter, manjar blanco and chicharrón, which are found at very economic prices. = Tourism = Some tourist attractions near the town include the Astobamba's prairie and its peaks, the Baths of Shucsha, and of course the incredible Waywash range. Inca trails are still preserved and they are used as bridle paths by the locals. The fauna of Cajatambo conserves several wild species: andean foxes, vicuñas, vizcachas, andean condors, eagles, falcons, among others. In the same town falcons can be seen.

The park is located northeast of Buffalo, partially in the Village of Williamsville with the balance located in the Town of Amherst. The park is managed by the Town of Amherst under an agreement with the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. History The property that now hosts the park was formerly part of the St. Mary of the Angels Convent, operated by the Sisters of St. Francis at that location since 1923. The convent was put up for sale in 1999. The property was acquired by the Town of Amherst and New York State in January 2000, after both entities evenly split the $5 million price to purchase the former convent and surrounding area. New York State owns of the property while the Town of Amherst owns the remaining of the park's lands. Under an agreement with the state, the town is responsible for managing the property for the purpose of conservation and to make space available for passive recreation. The convent's former motherhouse complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. It was approved for sale by the town in November 2002, with the intent to allow development of a 102-unit senior housing facility, and is not included in the park. The facility opened in 2004.

Although the current definition of the Nine Provinces can be dated to the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, it was not until the Eastern Han dynasty that the Nine Provinces were treated as actual administrative regions.  Different interpretations of the Nine Provinces  Conjectural map of the Nine Provinces The Rongcheng Shi bamboo slips from the Chu state has the earliest interpretation of the Nine Provinces, but these early descriptions differ widely from the currently recognized Nine Provinces. The Nine Provinces, according to the Rongcheng Shi, are Tu (涂), Jia (夾), Zhang (竞), Ju (莒), Ou (藕), Jing (荊), Yang (陽), Xu (敘) and Cuo (虘). 上博简《容成氏》九州柬释 禹画九州论 The most prevalent account of the Nine Provinces comes from the Yu Gong or Tribute of Yu section of the Book of Xia (夏書), collected in the Book of Documents. It was therein recorded that Yu the Great divided the world into the nine provinces of Ji (冀), Yan (兗), Qing (青), Xu (徐), Yang (揚), Jing (荊), Yu (豫), Liang (梁) and Yong (雍). The geography section (釋地) of the ancient Erya encyclopedia also cites nine provinces, but with You and Ying (營) listed instead of Qing and Liang. In the \\"Clan Responsibilities\\" (職方氏) section of Rituals of Zhou, the provinces include You and Bing but not Xu and Liang. The Lüshi Chunqiu \\"Initial Survey\\" (有始覽) section mentions You but not Liang. Traditionally, the Book of Documents is thought to depict the divisions during the Xia dynasty, the Erya those of the Shang dynasty; the Rituals of Zhou the Zhou dynasty and the Lüshi Chunqiu the concept and actual territorial distribution of the Nine Provinces during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. The Lüshi Chunqiu contains the following passage on the location of the nine provinces and their general correspondence with the states of the time: The words \\"Nine Provinces\\" do not appear in any ancient oracle bone inscriptions, 中国古称\\"九州\\"，九州指哪九州？ such that many scholars do not think Yu the Great created the Nine Provinces as was traditionally thought. 是禹划定九州的吗？ Some suggest the name \\"Jiuzhou\\", which came to mean \\"Nine Provinces\\", was actually a place, \\"九洲同乐\\"的\\"九洲\\"是指什么？ or the divisions were within Shandong. 温玉春：古九州方位在泰沂山系一带——九州考 Later on, Zou Yan, an adherent of the Taoist Yin and Yang School (陰陽家), proposed a new theory of the \\"Greater Nine Provinces\\" (大九州). According to him, the nine provinces in the Book of Documents were only \\"minor\\" provinces, which combined to form the \\"Red County / Divine Province\\" (赤縣神州), i.e. China (cf. Shenzhou). Nine such provinces then form another \\"medium\\" nine provinces surrounded by a sea. There are nine such medium provinces, which were surrounded by a Great Ocean, forming the Greater Nine Provinces. The Nine Provinces' names in the \\"Geographical Instruction\\" section (地形訓) of Huainanzi, annotations to Zhang Heng's biography (張衡傳注) in Book of the Later Han and volume eight of the Chuxue Annals (初學記), are different from the traditional ones listed above. They all include Shenzhou, which led some scholars to suggest they are the names of the Greater Nine Provinces. 九州是指哪九个州？ 请问四海、九州、八荒、六合、六国是指哪些？ According to the \\"Forms of Earth\\" (墜形訓) section of the Huainanzi, outside the Greater Nine Provinces are the Eight Yin (八殥), the Eight Hong (八紘) and the Eight Ji (八極). According to the Genealogical Descent of the Emperors (帝王世紀), rulers before Shennong had influence over the Greater Nine Provinces, but those from the Yellow Emperor onwards did not extend their virtue that far. The Greater Nine Provinces theory was based on the knowledge in the states of Yan and Qi near the South China Sea that China comprised only 1/81 of the entire world, markedly different from the Sinocentric point of view that was prevalent at the time. Geographic knowledge from increasing contact between the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE) and its neighbours proved the theory false and it lost popularity. By the time of the Three Kingdoms period (220-280 CE) the Nine Provinces had expanded into thirteen provinces together with a central administrative region. What were the Nine Provinces?

The sets cost $1000, half the price of a new low-end automobile. By the end of 1954, RCA released an improved color TV with a 21-inch picture tube. The CT-100, which had 36 vacuum tubes in its CTC-2 chassis (known as \\"Merrill\\" to the marketing department) was the most complicated electronic device sold to the general public at the time of its release. After initial sales to early adopters, the rest sold poorly, even after a price cut. Many were donated by RCA for training purposes to trade schools and technical colleges, the source of most of today's survivors. RCA sold the CT-100 at a loss. RCA later recalled the CT-100, replacing many of them with a newer 21-inch model. CT-100 at the SPARK Museum of Electrical Invention playing Superman. Early NBC Living Color programs included An Evening with Fred Astaire. The CT-100 was created in 1954, before the Peacock existed.Extensive CT-100 restoration page RCA CT-100 sets are extremely sought-after by electronics collectors and restorers, with restorers often spending thousands of dollars to obtain or repair a set. It is believed that RCA only made 4000 CT-100 receivers. Around 150 survive, but only 30 are restored and working. The Early Television Museum in Hilliard, Ohio has a restored and working set on display, as does the SPARK Museum of Electrical Invention in Bellingham, Washington. One reason for the rarity of surviving sets is that the RCA-developed tri-color cathode ray tube (the 15GP22) that was used in the CT-100 was notorious for its glass-to-metal seals breaking down, causing the tube to lose its vacuum.https://www.earlytelevision.org/15gp22.html It is extremely rare to find tubes that still work. The 15G was a glass tube, but its high voltage connection is a metal ring between the face of the tube and the glass bell. This is where the leakage often occurs.

They have worked with several Japanese pop and rock stars and also have won two Japan Record Awards for their musical arrangements for singer Ayumi Hamasaki (with \\"Free & Easy\\" in 2002 and \\"No way to say\\" in 2003). Biography Hal went from music arrangers into a music band and then back to music arrangers, arranging songs for many Japanese artists. Toshiharu Umezaki (sometimes written as Toshiyasu Umezaki) is known as the main member and leader of the band, which had gone through some deformations in their structure. The sound of Hal is mainly a lively digital beat at the edge where the electric guitars are used a lot, as a special feature and typic in their arrangements. Hal started out as music arrangers in 1999, and became known especially for the work that they did (and are still doing) with Ayumi Hamasaki. \\"Appears\\", \\"Fly High\\", \\"M\\", \\"Evolution\\" and \\"No Way to Say\\" are some of their most famous tunes with her. They also have worked with some other artists like Ami Suzuki, the KinKi Kids, Every Little Thing, and Dream. In 2000 the group of men did a casting to choose a female vocalist for forming the musical group Hal, which was an idea of Toshiharu Umesaki and Atsushi Sato's. Finally the singer Halna was chosen to be a part of Hal and they signed a deal with record label Avex Trax. They temporarily stopped their group as arrangers after the work with \\"Grip!\\" from Every Little Thing. After the release of seven singles and two studio albums as Hal, the band got separated in 2003 because Halna decided to leave the group and get away from the spotlight, with the release of their final album, called \\"Singles\\", a compilation album with all the singles released by the band, and they started to work again as arrangers with Ayumi Hamasaki and Tackey & Tsubasa. Atsushi Sato also left the band that year to arrange music on his own, under the nickname of ats-. He has recently worked with Ami Suzuki under Avex, and Yuta Nakano, who left the band in early 2001 is currently working as remixer and also arranger. Currently Umezaki and Shimizu keep their name Hal active, arranging songs for Japanese singers and music groups.

Carlisi also known as \\"Black Sam\\" and \\"Sam Wings\\" (December 15, 1914 – January 2, 1997), was a Chicago gangster who was the boss of the Chicago Outfit criminal organization Between 1989 – 1996. Sam Carlisi's brother Roy was a caporegime in the Buffalo crime family, otherwise known as the Magaddino crime family. Roy was close to legendary Buffalo Mafia boss Stefano Magaddino, which gave Sam direct access to various east coast crime families that were aligned with the Buffalo Mafia such as those based in Rochester and Utica, New York and in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Sam was known to use these connections to further his gambling and bookmaking interests, to fence stolen goods and possibly for narcotics operations he was overseeing or involved in. He was a cousin of mobster Al Tornabene. Carlisi started his criminal career with the Outfit as a driver for mobster Joseph Aiuppa when he was boss of the Cicero, Illinois crew. He is the uncle to Chicago Outfit mobsters Dominick DiMaggio and Nicholas DiMaggio. When Aiuppa was convicted in 1986 for the skimming of the Las Vegas casinos, Carlisi served as his replacement and as a front man. Carlisi earned his nickname \\"Wings\\" because he often flew around the country as a mob courier during the 1970s. When Ferriola became the boss of the Outfit, Carlisi served as his underboss. This followed the murders of Michael and Tony Spilotro, in which Carlisi had supposedly been involved. After Ferriola was diagnosed with cancer, he assigned the day-to-day supervision of the Outfit to Carlisi. After Ferriola died, Carlisi became the new boss. In March 1996, Carlisi was convicted of mob racketeering, loansharking, and arson in connection with an illegal gambling business in the Chicago area and the West suburbs and was sentenced to 13 years in prison.

The species was first described by Eugenius Johann Christoph Esper in 1793. One of the grandest sights is a host of spot swordtails mud-puddling or swarming around a flowering forest tree. The spot swordtail gets its name from the line of distinct white spots along the margin of its wings. Range It is known from southern and eastern India (including Sikkim and Assam), Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Kampuchea. Description It differs from Graphium antiphates chiefly in the greater width of the black markings on the upperside, especially of the basal and subbasal bands that cross the forewing, both of which also extend to the dorsum. On the hindwing the black markings of the underside on the basal and discal areas are not only seen by transparency from below, but are actually represented, though only partially, by black scaling; the width of the dark grey terminal portion is also greater, and it has a tendency to turn to dusky black anteriorly, so that the sub-terminal series of black lunules are obscured anteriorly and are difficult to make out. Underside: markings similar to those of the typical form, but broader; forewing with the discal transverse band that reaches from costa to vein 1; hindwing: the black bands that cross the cell broader and proportionately closer together. It has a 94–100 mm expanse. Males and females. Upperside bluish-white. Forewing: cell with five broad transverse black bands, the basal and subbasal bands produced to the dorsum, the medial band generally extended into interspace 2, the preapical ended on the median rein, and the fifth or apical from costa along the discocellulars extends on both sides of these and terminates at lower apex of cell; beyond the fifth band is a short macular transverse bar of the ground colour that terminates on vein 5, followed by a very broad black terminal band that occupies about one- third of the width of the wing and is traversed by a transverse subterminal series of rounded spots of the ground colour. Hindwing: ground colour along dorsum and above vein 7 whitish; a streak along the dorsum, a subbasal and an inner discal transverse band from costa across cell, and a very broad terminal band, black; the former two joined near the tornus by cross lunular black marks, the terminal band traversed by a series of slender lunules of the ground colour; a small black spot in interspace 1 above tornus and another at base of interspace 4; the black at the apices of interspaces 2 to 4 and the lunules of the ground colour thereon suffused with grey; tail black, edged and tipped with white. Underside white, the black markings very similar but of a bronze brown with the following exceptions: Forewing: extensions below the median vein of the basal, subbasal, and median transverse bands crossing the cell, and the inner portion below vein 4 of the terminal broad band, black: on the hindwing the inner discal band is broken, irregular and black, and is bordered by a series of red spots outwardly edged with black; the subterminal series of lunules of the ground colour are broadly edged on the outer side with black; the grey patch in the caudal region is replaced by ochraceous grey. Antennae black; head, thorax and abdomen creamy white, with a medial broad longitudinal stripe; beneath, the abdomen with lateral black stripes. It has a wingspan of 68–95 mm. Status This butterfly is fairly common and tends to be local. It is not known to be threatened. Habitat Generally found in deciduous forest areas, among bushes with lesser secondary growth. Locally abundant below and less common above this level. Generally stays close to hilly and forested country. Habits Spot swordtail seen mud-puddling at Yeoor, India It is shy and wary. It flies close to the ground and has a dodgy and fast flight, especially when disturbed. They often visits flowers. Spot swordtails may be seen to cluster around flowering trees. They are fond of Gmelina arborea, a deciduous tree from dry areas. Large numbers can be seen settling on damp roads and wet patches, especially in hot summers. It basks close to the ground, with wings partially open or completely spread. It is a known migrant in Sri Lanka. Life cycle Individuals are active from February to June. They are most abundant in March–April. It has been recorded in western India from July onwards for a few months. In the Nilgiris it has been recorded from February to October. =Eggs= Miliusa velutina Eggs are spherical, yellowish and slightly shiny. They are laid singly on the upper surface or at the margin on the underside of young leaves or buds. =Larva= The larva is black with a green underside. It has white transverse stripes. The anterior and posterior segments are yellowish. It has a pair of spines on each thoracic and anal segments. Glossy green osmeterium. It is a sluggish caterpillar which feeds mainly in the evening and at night. \\"Not so thick proportionally at the fourth segment as those of agamemnon, sarpedon and doson, and is somewhat quadrangular. It has four pairs of spines which are small but sharp. The most usual colour......is black, banded on the sides with narrow white stripes, except on the first three or four segments and the last., on which there is more or less rusty red ; but the shade varies very much, and in some the groundcolour is green.\\" (Davidson and Aitken) =Pupa= Has the usual horn which characterizes this group, and also two short processes on the head, and is of some shade of earthy brown. It is attached by the tail and a close band and is not on the food plant but in crevices or under stones or roots. Food plants The larval host plants are Miliusa tomentosum, Miliusa velutina and Polyalthia longifolia of the family Annonaceae. Miliusa tomentosum is a deciduous tree. The pupae of the previous year's brood emerge, seek mates and lay eggs just as the tree puts out new growth.

The region is also credited to be the earliest place to experience agrarian expansion, initiated by a few Nasrani families of the region, as early as the 1840s. This trend of expansion later spread to other places in and around Meenachil and Kanjirapally Taluks. These expansions brought about major changes in the social and economic scene of Central Travancore. Economy Most of the Syrian Catholic families here are rubber estate owners.

It has been used for over 20 years as insulation for pipes and ductwork, and has a long history as a soundproofing material for studios, sound stages, auditoriums, and the like. The low smoke and flame properties of melamine foam prevent it from being a fire hazard. Melamine foam is the active component of a number of abrasive cleaner sponges. It is also used as the main sound and thermal insulation material for bullet trains, due to its high sound absorption, excellent thermal insulation performance and light weight. As a cleaner A \\"Mr. Clean Magic Eraser\\" brand sponge, made from melamine foam In the early 21st century it was discovered that melamine foam is an effective abrasive cleaner. The open-cell foam is microporous and its polymeric substance is very hard, so that when used for cleaning it works like extremely fine sandpaper, getting into tiny grooves and pits in the object being cleaned. On a larger scale the material feels soft because the reticulated foam bubbles interconnect. Its structure is a 3D network of very hard strands, when compared to the array of separate bubbles in a material such as styrofoam. Rubbing with a slightly moistened foam may remove otherwise \\"uncleanable\\" external markings from surfaces. For example, melamine foam can remove crayon, marker pen, and grease from painted walls and wood finishings, plastic-adhering paints from treated wooden tables, and adhesive residue and grime from hubcaps. If the surface being cleaned is not sufficiently hard, it may be finely scratched by the melamine material.

Loosely based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name,https://www.cbr.com/underworld- secrets/ she serves as the central character in the films Underworld (2003), Underworld: Evolution (2006), Underworld: Awakening (2012), and Underworld: Blood Wars (2016). Beckinsale's daughter, Lily Mo Sheen, plays the character as a child in a flashback in Underworld: Evolution. In Underworld: Endless War, Selene is voiced by Canadian voice actress, Laura Harris. Creation Selene was created by Kevin Grevioux, Len Wiseman, and Danny McBride. According to Grevioux, Selene is based on the Marvel Comics character named Selene, an X-Men villain. Selene was introduced in the first film of the series, Underworld. Character Flashbacks to her childhood have shown Selene to have been a normal, happy, vibrant child, born in the late 14th century. The youngest of two daughters of a master mason and smith, Selene and her sister Cecilia were shown to love painting pictures, and playing games like 'Silly Goose'. At the age of nineteen, the untimely and gruesome deaths of her entire family completely broke her heart, as she had loved them all dearly, and left her an orphan. The deaths of her six-year-old nieces hit her especially hard. Deceived by their murderer, Viktor, into believing that a pack of Lycans were the ones responsible, (which, given the states she found their bodies in, wasn't a hard lie for her to believe), Selene dedicated herself to avenging their deaths. As a Death Dealer (the Vampires' fighting elite), Selene committed herself to the duty of exterminating the Lycans as a species, a duty she saw as 'sacred' one, burying herself into her work. She would also isolate herself, never socializing with anyone outside of the Death Dealers, as the majority of the Vampire Coven are more concerned whiling away their immortal lives in hedonistic pursuits instead of concerning themselves with the serious business of the war against the Lycans. She would also serve as one of Viktor's most loyal and most powerful Death Dealers, having been vampirically-sired by him personally. While she would look up to Viktor as a surrogate father figure (and he sees her as a surrogate daughter), she would still continue to feel the pain of her grief and loss of her real family's deaths for the centuries to come. According to Kate Beckinsale in The Making of Underworld, by the point in time of the events of the first movie, Selene had been a soldier of the Vampire Clan for so long, it had gotten to the point where \\"[Selene's] almost forgotten she's a woman, she's absolutely focused on revenge and killing, and she's really good at it. Then, she meets Michael, she starts to get a... kind of memory of what it's like to be human, and to be with humans. She's not completely human, but she is actually 'human' somewhere underneath there.\\" According to the novelizations of the events of the movies, prior to crossing paths with Michael, Selene had never been in love before, although she wasn't still a virgin; neither love nor lust had lured Selene into 'carnal encounters' with other vampires, but rather curiosity, (having been turned while still a virgin) and loneliness. Such encounters had been few, infrequent, and without consequence, all of them temporary indulgences quickly put behind her. =Personality= Selene is headstrong and stubborn, even to a fault, not willing to back down when she knows something is wrong or leave any stone unturned when she is investigating Lycan activity. This can continue even to the point of endangering herself, such as when she passed out from blood loss at the wheel of her car after Michael warned her against driving in her condition. Selene is described as being \\"steely-eyed\\", and having great \\"emotional independence\\" from the rest of the Coven, as well being of \\"extreme intelligence\\" and of \\"sharp intuition\\". In her Underworld official bio, it is stated that she \\"trusts almost no-one\\", and that she has a \\"passion for truth, albeit laced with vengeance\\", which \\"traps her in a reluctantly violent and tragic purpose\\".Underworld page After centuries of militaristic discipline, having served as a Death Dealer of the vampire clan, Selene had long since developed a near-impervious, stoic external demeanor. Selene is not known for a sense of humor and is actually one of the most honest vampires in the franchise. She is also something of an idealist, believing in certain ideals as justice. Although a vampire for six centuries, Selene only really willingly interacted with other Death Dealers and has never fit in with her own kind (most of whom are too absorbed in their own pursuits of self-gratification) unlike them, Selene has never forgotten why she became a vampire and that they are at war with the Lycans, which leads her to consider them layabouts and dead weight, so she cares little for what they all think of her. In the first installment, Kraven, who fancies himself as her suitor, complains that she pays far too much attention to hunting and killing Lycans, and that she takes \\"this warrior business far too seriously\\". Selene, meanwhile, regards Kraven as \\"a pig, a coward and an insufferable egotist\\" who is too wrapped up in himself to even pick up on the fact that Selene simply doesn't want anything to do with him, let alone be his arm-trophy at the coven's social events. She dodges his social gatherings, she outright rejects his romantic advances at every turn, in public and in private and she prefers to dedicate her every waking hour into her calling as a Death Dealer. For the most part, Selene comes across as \\"icy\\" and \\"unemotional\\" to those who don't really bother to get close to her, like most of the coven. After years of being a disciplined soldier, Selene is well into the habit of keeping her emotions in check, and keeps her cool in the heat of battle and the face of danger. This same rigorous mentality has made it difficult sometimes to open up to others, especially Michael, early in the story. By her own admission, she's \\"not good with feelings\\". In the first novelization, she is described as being \\"much more comfortable discussing interrogation techniques\\" than \\"divulging the seamier underside of the vampiric lifestyle\\". In Underworld: Awakening, her own daughter easily misinterprets her behavior for being \\"as cold as one already dead\\", before Selene explains that her heart isn't cold, but it is broken (as Michael is missing at the time) Selene is also in the habit of downplaying any pain or wounds she has received - a habit of hers that Michael has since become familiar with. Cracks in Selene's emotional armor start to show themselves when she and then-human Michael Corvin meet for the first time at a subway, moments before a shootout, at the beginning of the first film. Other vampires, like Kraven and Erika, quickly catch on to Selene's feelings towards Michael before even she herself does. The two experience a mutual \\"dynamic attraction\\" at first sight and things start to escalate between the two of them, even after she learns that Michael has been bitten by a lycan while she was trying to protect him from them. Because of his innocence, Selene defends Michael from both vampire and lycan, knowing full well Viktor would kill her for doing so. Selene also becomes noticeably more violent when those she loves suffer or die. When her family was murdered, she went on a revenge spree against the lycans (whom she had been led to believe were responsible by Viktor) that lasted over six centuries, until the truth was revealed to her. When she learns of Viktor's hand in her family's murder and sees him about to kill Michael, she slices through his head with his own sword the first shot she gets, without hesitation. Furthermore, when she believes Michael dead by Markus' hand she goes on a suicide mission to eliminate Markus and William, before Michael's hybrid abilities revive him; Selene doesn't care if she dies, just as long as she can take Markus and William down with her. When Markus brings up her family, after impaling her with one of his wing talons, saying how it was a \\"mistake\\" for Viktor to have \\"(kept Selene) as a pet. He should have killed you with the rest of your family\\" (in the novelization, Markus also calls them \\"insignificant\\"); in a fit of rage, Selene snaps the wing talon off at a joint, using it to stab him through the head before pushing him into the spinning rotors of a helicopter. In Underworld: Awakening, when her daughter is taken by the lycans at the Antigen facility, Selene stages an attack on the building, luring the lycan security personnel into a trap by taking the elevator up the building and setting silver gas explosives at every floor, to get back her daughter.  Biography  = Backstory = As revealed in the first & second films, Selene was born to a Hungarian family; her father, mother, her older sister (Cecilia), and her baby twin nieces. Selene is estimated to have been born around the year 1383. At some point, Selene's father was approached by a powerful warlord named Viktor with a commission to design and build a prison. According to the novelizations, Selene's father was well known as both a stone mason and blacksmith; and the commission had involved the excavation of a new dungeon and prison under a fortress of Viktor's, as well as striking two unique keys for one cell in particular. Selene was around 6-7-years-old when work on the prison completed. Seven years later, at around the age of 13 to 14 years, Selene became an aunt to her older sister's twin daughters. During the winter of Lucian's escape, about 6-years-later, Viktor feared that Lucian may know of William, the progenitor of all werewolves, (given that Lucian, whether he knew it or not, was now holding one of the keys to William's prison): To Keep the Location of William's prison a secret, Viktor personally killed everyone involved in the construction of the prison and anyone who may have visited or seen the fortress. One night, Viktor prowled into the farm of Selene's family, killed, and fed upon them one-by-one. When he came across Selene, however, he found that he 'could not bear the thought of draining [her] dry', (as described by Kraven) '[Selene], who reminded him so much of his precious Sonja'. That night Viktor turned Selene into a vampire — according to the Underworld: Evolution novelization, Selene was 19 years old when Viktor turned her — and led her to believe that the culprits of the murder of her family were Lycans and that Viktor had saved her from them. He claimed to have been tracking The Lycans when they led him to her family's farm. With the strength of a vampire, Viktor told Selene, she could avenge them all. Selene was the only survivor to have walked through the corridors of the fortress. Viktor did not kill her because of her resemblance to his deceased daughter and his belief that she would have been much too young to remember where exactly the fortress' location was. Selene would go on to become a Death Dealer, fighting against the Lycans for vengeance on the atrocities she believed they had committed against her family. For the centuries that followed, (the better part of a thousand years,) she would serve under Viktor with blind loyalty, remaining in the dark about her family's murder by none other than Viktor himself. On Viktor's orders, Selene would exile Andreas Tanis, the Coven's official historian. At some point, she would also become the unwilling object of the romantic interests of Kraven, the Coven's regent. =Underworld= After a confrontation with the Lycan hitman Raze, she discovered what was supposedly a Lycan lair. She was angry when Kraven dismissed her claims, not knowing that Kraven was in league with the Lycan leader Lucian in a bid to take over the control of the vampire realm from the Elders. She tracked down Michael Corvin, in whom she believed the Lycans had an interest. Against the sacred laws of The Vampire Covenant, she and Michael, who was infected with the lycanthropy virus, fell in love. She awakens Viktor from his deep slumber (torpor), believing that only he has the power to deal with the conspiracy between Kraven and Lucian. She then leads a mass assault on the Lycans' underground bunker. After Michael was shot with silver nitrate by Kraven, Selene was forced to infect Michael with her vampire strain in order to save his life, thus making him the first hybrid, a Lycan dominant hybrid. She also learned the truth about the identity of her family's killer from Kraven; she struck Viktor down while the Elder was preoccupied fighting Michael. She then retrieved Sonja's pendant, carrying-on her legacy. =Underworld: Evolution= In Underworld: Evolution, after Viktor's death, Selene and Michael went on the run from both Lycans and Vampires. They were confronted by Markus, the last surviving Vampire Elder. He was now a Vampire- Dominant Hybrid, due to his ingesting the blood of Lycan scientist Singe, which had seeped into his chamber. As Markus attacks her, Michael intervenes and battles him to protect her. After narrowly escaping Markus and the sunlight, Selene and Michael take refuge in a warehouse and begin a sexual relationship. Selene also finds that she has seen the pendant that Markus was trying to get, when she was a child. In order to find out why Markus was after the pendant, she sought out Andreas Tanis. Tanis told her the truth about her family's slaughter, (they were killed after Lucian began his revolution to keep William from being freed,) and revealed to her that, contrary to popular belief, Markus, not Viktor, is the original vampire. He then set up a meeting for her and Michael with Alexander Corvinus, Markus's father and the first true immortal. Selene was angered at Alexander for not removing the threat his sons, Markus and William, posed long ago. Alexander retorted by asking her if she would murder her own son. An interruption by Markus, in which Michael is seemingly killed, also results in Selene's memories of the fortress to be revealed to Markus through her blood. Alexander, dying from his son's attack, told Selene that the only way to defeat Markus and William would be to drink his legendary immortal blood, adding that she would become \\"The Future\\". Selene gained greater strength and new powers from Alexander's blood. She and a squad of Alexander's Cleaners, (who, like Michael, are Alexander's descendants through his third son,) invaded William's dungeon, trying to stop the threat. They arrived too late, however, and Selene was forced to fight Markus. Markus was shocked at the smell of his father's blood coursing through Selene's veins. Locking Markus in William's dungeon, Selene discovered that William had infected all surviving members of the six Cleaners escorting her, all of which have become Lycans themselves. Markus killed the last remaining Cleaners who were operating a helicopter which provided close air support/suppressing-fire. When it crashed, the rotors continued to spin dangerously close to those in the fray. Selene fought Markus once more, and the Elder drove his wing talon through Selene's chest. Selene, empowered by Alexander's ancient and pure blood, tore away the talon and drove it upwards through Markus's skull before throwing him into the moving rotor blades and killing him. After Selene defeats Markus and Michael defeats William, sunlight lands on Selene's arm, revealing that Alexander's blood has purged the vampiric weakness to sunlight. =Underworld: Rise of the Lycans= Selene briefly appears at the end of Underworld: Rise of the Lycans, which was also the opening scene of the first Underworld, with the audio from the scene where Kraven tells Selene that it was Viktor who murdered her family, rather than the Lycans, and that Viktor spared her because she reminded him of the daughter he condemned to death; Selene replies to Kraven, \\"Lies\\". =Underworld: Awakening= In Underworld: Awakening, Selene escapes imprisonment to find herself in a world where humans have discovered the existence of both Vampire and Lycan clans, and are conducting an all-out war to eradicate both immortal species. However, Selene and her two new allies; David, (a young vampire,) and Detective Sebastian, (who lost his wife after being discovered as a vampire), discover a hidden conspiracy from rogue members of the Lycan clan within the humans' war against both species, and also finds that she has mothered a child with Michael, Eve, who was born during Selene's suspended animation. Despite their never having met or become acquainted with one another since Eve's birth, Selene ultimately bonds with her daughter. Selene battles to rescue Eve and Michael, facing a 'Super Lycan', with abilities similar to her own including incredible healing rate and an immunity to silver. Eventually Selene kills the Super Lycan, and rescues Eve, who kills the Lycan doctor in charge, but when they go to rescue Michael (whom Selene had found and weakened the cryogenic tank of earlier), they find that he has already escaped and are unable to locate him, but Selene knows he will be hunted like Eve was. Earlier in the film David offers her the opportunity to return to the vampire coven, in hopes she will consent to train a new generation of Death Dealers in response to both the human and Lycan threats, as many of their numbers are either in hiding from their enemies or dead. =Underworld: Blood Wars= Following the events of Awakening, Selene sends Eve away for her own safety with not even Selene knowing where she is. Selene keeps a lock of Eve's hair in remembrance and is hunted by the Lycans for Eve's location and the Vampires as a traitor for killing the Vampire Elder Viktor. In response to the threat posed by new Lycan leader Marius, the Vampire Council agrees to grant Selene clemency in exchange for Selene training their Death Dealers to fight this new threat. David eventually convinces Selene to take the offer, but she is betrayed by Council member Semira and her lover Death Dealer Varga as Semira desires revenge for Viktor's death and mostly covets Selene's power for herself. With the help of David and Thomas, Selene escapes, but not before at least a litre of her blood is drained and Thomas killed. Following Thomas' last wishes, David and Selene travel to the Nordic Coven where David is revealed to be the son of the Vampire Elder Amelia and her rightful heir. Selene meets Nordic warrior, Lena, who shows her the Nordic Coven's cocooning process, a process that enables them to access the \\"special place\\" between worlds and enhance their abilities. Shortly afterwards, Marius and his Lycans attack the Coven and Selene is defeated. Marius learns from Selene's blood memories that she truly does not know where Eve is and remembering that Lena told her the cocooning process starts with the Vampire submerging themselves in water, Selene submerges herself in a frozen lake. She is later retrieved by David and Lena and cocooned properly. During the Lycan attack on the Eastern Coven, Selene returns with her powers enhanced by the cocooning, wearing the coat of a member of the Nordic Coven and with her hair having turned partially white. Selene leads the Nordic Vampires to the aid of the Eastern Coven and battles Marius, learning from his blood memories that he murdered her lover Michael and is using his blood to temporarily increase his own abilities (believing that Eve's blood will make this permanent). Selene uses her new speed to get behind Marius and rip out his spine, killing him. David is then able to use Marius' head to get the remaining Lycans to retreat. Following the battle, Selene helps to treat the injured Vampires wounds and is elected one of the new Vampire Elders, alongside David and Lena, making Selene one of the three new leaders of the entire Vampire race. In a flash forward, it is revealed that Selene was reunited with Eve while at the Nordic Coven. Skills and vampiric attributes Selene is proficient with many weapons, medieval and modern. She is well versed with both projectile and melee weapons. Modern firearms that she uses include the Walther P99 and a variety of fully automatic machine pistols. Selene is also an expert in unarmed combat. In Blood Wars, Selene's combat skills are stated to be \\"second to none.\\" In all three films, she is seen jumping from a ledge of at least one hundred feet and landing without injury. As a vampire, Selene frequently demonstrates superior physical abilities. After absorbing the Corvinus strain directly from Alexander Corvinus, Selene's powers were greatly upgraded. Following her use of the Nordic Coven's sacred ritual, Selene's already incredible powers were greatly enhanced. Selene is stated to be \\"the Purest Vampire\\" due to having Alexander Corvinus' blood and is one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful Vampire at the time of Blood Wars. *Superhuman agility: Selene is able to perform athletic moves, such as doing a back-flip into a hole in a bridge, and leaping from tree to tree in an instant. In Awakening, she is able to do a spinning headscissors to a Lycan, and is seen jumping over two cars with one hand. Selene's agility has proven to help her in battle against the Lycans, allowing her to take on multiple Lycans at once. She has shown the ability of cling in the walls like an insect. *Superhuman healing: She can heal rapidly from most wounds in just minutes, including sunlight burns and a shotgun blast to the abdomen. However, injuries that result in massive loss of blood in a short time can be fatal and she must ingest fresh blood in order to properly heal. After becoming a Vampire-Corvinus Strain Hybrid, her healing powers were increased to the point where she could withstand Marcus's wing talon being impaled through her chest without suffering any visible effects and survive after being shot in the head and other parts of her body. She is also seen to be able to force bullets out of her body. *Superhuman strength: Being a vampire, later a vampire-human hybrid, Selene is even much stronger than humans and most other supernatural creatures. She grabs Michael by the throat and holds him against a wall several feet off the ground, performs spectacular leaps, and strikes her enemies with tremendous force. She is able to kill younger vampires with just a few blows and manhandles four police officers with ease. She is shown to be able to engage lycans in close-quarter combat without being harmed, even before becoming infected with the corvinus strain. After her infection, she is shown to be able to ram her arm through a lycan in battle and has also gone toe-to-toe in physical fight against Marcus, despite his status as the first vampire and a hybrid. In the stunts featurette on the Underworld DVD/Blu-ray, the stunt coordinators mention how they have to make it look like Selene had the \\"strength of ten men\\". In Underworld: Awakening, she uses the greatest extent of her strength seen to date when she flips a van, which has momentum equal to 180 tons. In Underworld: Blood Wars, thanks to the Nordic Coven's enhancement, Selene is able to rip the spine out of a transformed lycan hybrid with her bare hands. *Superhuman speed: She moves with incredible celerity, able to move between streets and run across hallways appearing as nothing more than a blurred image. In Underworld: Evolution, Selene was quick enough to sprint by and incapacitate a group of police officers without them being able to keep up with her movements. In Underworld: Awakening, she is shown speeding through two lines of armed guards while slitting their throats with a scalpel in the process, and then disappearing in an instant. She also demonstrates speed akin to teleportation when she breaks into a scientist's apartment and moves right next to him in an instant. In Underworld: Blood Wars, after her powers are enhanced by the Nordic Coven, Selene's speed grows to the point that she can move about as a blur that no one is capable of following. *Superhuman senses: Being a vampire she has increased senses like hearing, sight, smell, etc. *Superhuman durability: She is seen jumping from a ledge at least 100 feet (12 floors) high and landing without injury. She can leap to high places with ease, seen when jumping over large fences. She can take a shotgun blast to the abdomen without flinching. She is able to perform amazing feats of strength without fatigue and can withstand the crushing depths of the ocean without a wetsuit or breathing apparatus. *Blood sorting: In Underworld: Awakening, Selene demonstrates the ability to absorb and read another Immortal's blood memories (similar to that of what the Elders did) by drinking the blood of her daughter, Eve. In Underworld: Blood Wars, she is able to use this ability to read the memories of David, the lycan Marius and herself by drinking her own blood. *Immunity to UV light: Due to her nature as a vampire-human hybrid, Selene possesses a pure Immortal's immunity to UV light. At the end of Underworld: Evolution, her eyes are shown to be able to turn almost a pure white and she is now able to walk in the sunlight. Selene is shown using this ability to ambush the lycans in daylight during Underworld: Awakening and to escape with David in Underworld: Blood Wars. When talking with Detective Sebastian, Selene calls her UV immunity a gift from Alexander Corvinus. *Sensory synchronization: Selene and her daughter can perceive each other psychically when in relative close proximity to each other. *Resurrection: Selene has displayed the ability to resurrect deceased vampires as vampire- human hybrids like herself by applying her blood directly to their hearts as she did when she resurrected David in Underworld: Awakening. This is an ability unique to her as shown by other vampires amazement over her ability to resurrect David in Underworld: Awakening. In other media Selene appears in the video game Underworld: The Eternal War. Selene is the third-person shooter throughout the missions. Production background Kate Beckinsale at the San Diego Comic-Con in 2011 In 2003's Underworld, Kate Beckinsale became known as an actor and stated that it was markedly different from her previous work and Beckinsale has said she was grateful for the change of pace after appearing in \\"a bunch of period stuff and then a bunch of romantic comedies.\\" \\"It was quite a challenge for me to play an action heroine and pull off all that training when [in real life] I can't catch a ball if it's coming my way.\\" The film received mostly negative reviews but was a surprise box office hit and has gained a cult following. In September 2003, shortly after the release of Underworld, production companies Screen Gems and Lakeshore planned to release a prequel as the third film following Underworlds sequel, Underworld: Evolution. Kate Beckinsale, who portrayed Selene in Underworld, expressed interest in reprising her role for the sequel and the prequel. In 2006, Beckinsale reprised her role as Selene in the successful vampire sequel Underworld: Evolution, directed by her husband. It was the first time she had \\"been involved with a movie from the moment it's a germ of an idea right through the whole editing process.\\" Her daughter had a small role as the younger Selene, and took direction well: \\"I didn't think she would take either of us that seriously. We both envisaged a situation where it would be kind of like trying to get her into a snow suit. She suddenly became highly professional ... She said, “Could you call me Selene?” I certainly don't insist on being called Selene, so she didn't get that from me.\\" In a June 2006 interview, When asked if Kate Beckinsale would reprise her role as Selene in the prequel, Wiseman said, \\"It will be in the time period before, but it will overlap into the creation of her as well. We're in the process of seeing how far we go with that.\\" In the actual film, Selene appears briefly at the end. Beckinsale did not film new footage, a scene from Underworld was used to bookend the film. Beckinsale also provided a monologue for the beginning of the film. Beckinsale returned to the role of Selene for the fourth installment of the vampire franchise Underworld: Awakening. She \\"wasn't intending to do another one\\" but was convinced by the quality of the script: \\"You really want to see stakes that mean something in these kind of movies. Otherwise, it really is just lots of explosions and people running around in tight clothes.\\" Publication history Selene appears in the non-canon novel Underworld: Blood Enemy, written by Greg Cox. Selene is responsible for the death of renegade Lycan Leyba, tracking her down after Leyba's forces attack a Lycan weapons deal and are responsible for the deaths of both the Lycans and another member of Selene's team. During the confrontation with Leyba, Leyba briefly reflects that Selene's eyes are like 'hers' (Sonja's), but Selene never learns the meaning of this comment before she kills Leyba. Leyba's goals remain a mystery to Selene. Selene also appears in the IDW Publishing Underworld series. Selene is portrayed as having the same characterization as seen in the film. Selene also appears in the sequel novelization series for Underworld: Evolution. The only novelization series of Underworld she hasn't appear in is the novelization for Underworld: Rise of the Lycans. Reception Though the first film received generally negative reviews from critics, several elements were praised by audiences and a number of reviewers, including the \\"icy English composure\\" in Kate Beckinsale's performance as Selene. A few scenes of Underworld: Evolution were shown in a panel at Comic-Con in San Diego, in July 2005; however, these scenes did not contain any plot spoilers of the new script, with attendees only being informed about the new hybrids by production designer Patrick Tatopoulos. The previewing was well-received as hundreds of fans waited hours to see a clip of the film as well as Kate Beckinsale and the other stars of the movie.(July 18, 2005). Comic-Con 2005: Underworld: Evolution Panel. IGN. Retrieved 2010-11-13. In a review for Underworld: Awakening, a top critic from Variety said \\"Once again, Beckinsale brings an impressive physicality and subzero cool to her portrayal of Selene\\". Merchandise Due to the impact of the films, action figures for Selene were created, all designed by Mezco. Their size is 5 inches in scale. They all come with display base and accessories.

Its ecclesiastical territory includes 46 counties in western Oklahoma. The Most Reverend Paul Stagg Coakley is the current archbishop. As such, he is the metropolitan of the ecclesiastical province which includes the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City, the Diocese of Tulsa and the Diocese of Little Rock. Previously the bishop of the Diocese of Salina in Kansas, Archbishop Coakley was appointed to Oklahoma City on December 16, 2010 and installed as archbishop on February 11, 2011. History The diocese had its roots through French Benedictine monks who entered Indian Territory in 1875 to establish a Catholic presence. The Diocese of Oklahoma was established in 1905 with Belgian Theophile Meerschaert as its first bishop. St. Joseph's Church in downtown Oklahoma City served the diocese as its first cathedral until Our Lady of Perpetual Help replaced it in 1931. In the 1930s the name was changed to the Diocese of Oklahoma City and Tulsa to reflect shifting population trends in Oklahoma. It first achieved international attention when, in 1949, it became home to the National Shrine of the Infant Jesus of Prague.History , ShrineofinfantJesus.com. On December 13, 1972, Pope Paul VI split the diocese into two, creating the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City, which ministers to Catholics in the western part of Oklahoma, and the Diocese of Tulsa, which ministers to those in the east.History, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Oklahoma Web site (accessed February 17, 2010).

Under the protectionist policies of the time, the government provided land for Aboriginal people who had been dispossessed of their traditional lands by the arrival of European settlers to the colony of Victoria since the 1830s.Mission Voices, Coranderrk. Koorie Heritage Trust , Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Accessed 3 November 2008Meyer Eidelson, Coranderrk Station, in The Melbourne Dreaming. A Guide to the Aboriginal Places of Melbourne, pp113-114, Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra, 1997. Reprint 2000. The reserve was formally closed in 1924, with most residents removed to Lake Tyers Mission. Origins In February 1859, some Wurundjeri elders, led by Simon Wonga (aged 35) and brother Tommy Munnering (aged 24), petitioned the Protector of Aborigines, William Thomas, to secure land for the Kulin at the junction of the Acheron and Goulburn rivers. Initial representations to the Victorian Government were positive, however the intervention of the most powerful squatter in Victoria, Hugh Glass, resulted in their removal to a colder site, Mohican Station, which had been abandoned as unsuitable for agriculture.Isabel Ellender and Peter Christiansen, pp112-113, People of the Merri Merri. The Wurundjeri in Colonial Days, Merri Creek Management Committee, 2001 Richard Broome, pp123-125, Aboriginal Victorians: A History Since 1800, Allen & Unwin, 2005, , In 1860, the Kulin representatives met two young allies: a Scottish Presbyterian lay preacher called John Green (1830–1903), and his wife Mary Smith Benton Green (1835–1919), who established a school for the local children. In 1861, John Green accepted the position of General Inspector of the new Central Board Appointed to Watch Over the Interests of the Aborigines. After a fruitless attempt to establish a settlement for the Woiwurrung and Taungurong clans at Acheron, Green applied to the Board for permission to return to Woiwurrung country in order to establish a new reserve on the Yarra. In March 1863, after 3 years of upheaval, the surviving leaders, among them Simon Wonga and William Barak, led 40 Woi Wurrung, Taungurong and Bun warrung people over the Black Spur, with Green and his family. Finding their original site now occupied by squatters, they set up camp on a traditional camping site near the confluence of the Yarra and Badger Creek near Healesville, and requested ownership of the site. They were anxious to have the land officially approved so that they could move down and establish themselves. An area of was gazetted on 30 June 1863 and called \\"Coranderrk\\", at the Aboriginal people's suggestion. This was the name they used for the Christmas Bush (Prostanthera lasianthos), a white flowering summer plant which is indigenous to the area. In mid-1864, there were around 70 Aboriginal people living at Coranderrk. Coranderrk Station Coranderrk Station ran successfully for many years as an Aboriginal enterprise, selling wheat, hops and crafts on the burgeoning Melbourne market. Produce from the farm won first prize at the Melbourne International Exhibition in 1881; and other awards in previous years, such as 1872.Gary Presland, pp105-107, Aboriginal Melbourne: The Lost Land of the Kulin People, Harriland Press (1985), Second edition 1994, . By 1874, the Aboriginal Protection Board (APB) was looking for ways to undermine Coranderrk by moving people away due to their successful farming practices. Neighbouring farmers also wanted the mission closed as the land was now deemed 'too valuable' for Aboriginal people to occupy.Mission Voices, Coranderrk.

Coranderrk Petition In the 1870s and '80s, Coranderrk residents sent deputations to the Victorian colonial government protesting their lack of rights and the threatened closure of the reserve. The Royal Commission on the Aborigines in 1877, headed by William Foster Stawell and looking at the six reserves in Victoria (the others being Lake Condah, Lake Tyers, Framlingham, Ramahyuck, and Ebenezer), followed by a parliamentary inquiry in 1881 on the Aboriginal \\"problem\\", led to the Aborigines Protection Act 1886, which required \\"half-castes under the age of 35\\" to leave the reserve. Activist William Barak and others sent a petition on behalf of the Aboriginal people of Coranderrk to the Victorian Government in 1886, saying: \\"Could we get our freedom to go away Shearing and Harvesting and to come home when we wish and also to go for the good of our Health when we need it ... We should be free like the White Population there is only few Blacks now rem[a]ining in Victoria, we are all dying away now and we Blacks of Aboriginal Blood, wish to have now freedom for all our life time ... Why does the Board seek in these latter days more stronger authority over us Aborigines than it has yet been?\\" The Coranderrk Petition has survived and is on display at the Melbourne Museum in Carlton.Coranderrk Petition, Melbourne Museum The history of these events was brought to life in a verbatim theatre performance, called Coranderrk: We will show the country, written by Giordano Nanni and Andrea James, in which actors read the parts of the participants in the 1881 Inquiry. The book of the play, with a long introduction outlining the historical events, was published in 2013. Contents Chapter 1: A brief history of Coranderrk,1835–81 Decline, closure and aftermath As a result of the Aborigines Protection Act of 1886, around 60 residents were ejected from Coranderrk on the eve of the 1890s Depression. Their forced departure crippled Coranderrk as an enterprise, with only around 15 able-bodied men left to work the hitherto successful hop gardens. Almost half the land was reclaimed by government in 1893, and by 1924 orders came for its closure as an Aboriginal Station, despite protests from Wurundjeri returned servicemen who had fought in World War I. The reserve was formally closed in 1924, with most residents moved to Lake Tyers Mission in Gippsland in eastern Victoria. Five older people refused to move and continued living at Coranderrk until they died. The last known Aboriginal woman to live at Coranderrk was Elizabeth (Lizzie) Davis, who died in 1956, aged 104. She was denied permission to be buried at Coranderrk alongside her husband and siblings. The last Indigenous child to be born at Coranderrk Station was James Wandin in 1933, in the home of his grandmother, Jemima Wandin.Meyer Eidelson, The Footballer, First in the league, in Walks in Port Phillip.

Healesville Sanctuary In 1920, Sir Colin MacKenzie, a leading medical researcher, leased from the Aboriginal Protection Board to begin his work in comparative anatomy with Australian fauna. This was the catalyst for the creation of the Healesville Sanctuary, a popular zoo for Australian native animals, which today occupies part of the original Coranderrk reserve.Coranderrk, wurundjeri perspectives, plaque at Healesville Sanctuary, 2008.

It is also noted for challenging the so- called \\"compulsory cisheterosexual and normative structures, practices, and curricula\\" that marginalize or oppress non-heterosexual students and teachers.  Practice  QP explores and interrogates the student/teacher relationship, the role of identities in the classroom, the role of eroticism in the teaching process, the nature of disciplines and curriculum, and the connection between the classroom and the broader community with a goal of being both a set of theoretical tools for pedagogical critique / critique of pedagogy and/or a set of practical tools for those doing pedagogical work. The pedagogy focuses on the crisis of knowledge production that result from epistemological limits and regimes of power. Particularly, the pedagogy operates in a situation where the desire for knowledge is inhibited by the repetition of the heterosexual and queer normalization. One of the ways that these are addressed in this framework is by drawing attention to the unease and uncertainty regarding what one thinks and knows. History According to William Pinar, a curriculum theorist at the University of British Columbia, homosexuality and pedagogy have been linked as far back as the ancient Greeks and Romans. Modern notions of queer theory in education, however, originate around 1981 with Pinar's \\"Understanding Curriculum as Gender Text,\\" critiquing the way in which machisimo and masculinity plays out in Marxist educational theory. In 1982, Meredith Reiniger wrote about misogyny that had been internalized by her secondary English students. In 1983, James Sears wrote an article entitled \\"Sexuality: Taking off the Masks\\" for a journal called Changing Schools. The term \\"queer pedagogy\\" itself, however, appears to have originated in 1993 with an article in the Canadian Journal of Education. This article was written by two Canadian professors, Mary Bryson (University of British Columbia) and Suzanne de Castell (Simon Fraser University), who were grappling with poststructuralist and essentialist theories of identity in the context of a classroom setting. They present various techniques that they tried, but eventually conclude that the task is both necessary and impossible, concluding: \\"Queer pedagogy it is indeed, that, after all, in trying to make a difference we seem only able to entrench essentialist boundaries which continue both to define and to divide us.\\" In 1995, Deborah Britzman wrote an article entitled \\"Is there a queer pedagogy-- Or, stop reading straight.\\" In 1998, as part of William Pinar's anthology Queer Theory in Education, the challenge of articulating a queer pedagogy was taken up by a doctoral student at York University, Susanne Luhmann. In \\"Queering/Querying Pedagogy? Or, Pedagogy is a Pretty Queer Thing\\" (part of a larger anthology on Queer Theory in Education), she asks questions such as, \\"Is a queer pedagogy about and for queer students or queer teachers? Is a queer pedagogy a question of queer curriculum? Or, is it about teaching methods adequate for queer content? Or, about queer learning and teaching-- and what would that mean? Moreover, is a queer pedagogy to become the house pedagogy of queer studies or is it about the queering of pedagogical theory?\\" She suggests that an \\"inquiry into the conditions that make learning possible or prevent learning\\" through exploration of the teacher/student relationships and \\"the conditions for understanding, or refusing, knowledge.\\" In 2002, Tanya Olson (who teaches Developmental English at Vance-Granville Community College) further explored the teacher/student relationship in an article in Bad Subjects, an online cultural studies journal. In this article, entitled \\"TA/TG: The Pedagogy of the Cross-Dressed\\", Olson compared the experience of being a butch woman and not knowing which restroom and whether one was male or female to use to the experience of being a Teaching Assistant (TA) and not being fully a student or a teacher, drawing on it for inspiration towards creating a new conception of pedagogy. She concludes, \\"Maybe re-defining TAs in the academy will help stop the sense of masquerade that currently characterizes their work. No matter how much they challenge accepted cultural standards or straddle societal binary divisions, everyone deserves a bathroom they can call home. From there we can create a pedagogy of the cross-dressed.\\" Theoretical influences *Judith Butler *Sue-Ellen Case *Michel Foucault *Henry Giroux *bell hooks *Annamarie Jagose *Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick *Lois Banner *Guy Hocquenghem *William Pinar References * https://web.archive.org/web/20081002002758/http://educ.ubc.ca/faculty/bryson/pdf/qp.pdf * http://mingo.info-science.uiowa.edu/~stevens/critped/linkssex.htm * http://bad.eserver.org/issues/2002/59/Olson.html * https://web.archive.org/web/20070823142901/http://jqstudies.oise.utoronto.ca/journal/include/getdoc.php?id=120&article;=5&mode;=pdf * http://www.temple.edu/tempress/chapters_1100/1391_ch1.pdf * Queer Theory in Education.

Originating from the town of Amatrice (in the mountainous Province of Rieti of Lazio region), the Amatriciana is one of the best known pasta sauces in present-day Roman and Italian cuisine. The Italian government has named it a traditional agro- alimentary product of Lazio. Development Amatriciana originates from a recipe named pasta alla gricia. Grici were what Romans—modern dwellers of Rome, not the ancient ones—called the sellers of bread and comestibles.Ravaro (2005), p. 329 According to another hypothesis, the name originates from the hamlet of Grisciano, in the comune of Accumoli, near Amatrice. The sauce - nowadays named also Amatriciana bianca \\\\- was (and still is) prepared with guanciale (cured pork cheek) and grated pecorino. At some point, a little olive oil was added to the recipe. In the 1960s, the Amatriciana sauce was still prepared in this way in Amatrice itself.Gosetti (1967), p. 686 The invention of the first tomato sauces (and the likely earliest date for the introduction of tomato in the gricia, creating the Amatriciana) dates back to the late 18th century. The first written record of pasta with tomato sauce can be found in the 1790 cookbook L'Apicio Moderno by Roman chef Francesco Leonardi.Faccioli (1987), The culí di pomodoro recipe is found in the chapter devoted to Leonardi, at pg.756 The Amatriciana recipe became increasingly famous in Rome over the 19th and early 20th centuries, due to the centuries- old connectionIn Rione Ponte A lane called Vicolo dei Matriciani and a locanda bearing the same name are documented as having existed since the 17th century. Blasi (1923), sub voce between Rome and Amatrice.The town was originally part of the Abruzzo Ultra Department of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, but was annexed to the Abruzzi Region of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861, and was finally incorporated into Lazio as part of the Province of Rieti when the latter was created in 1927. The recipe was extremely well received and rapidly went on to be considered a classic of Roman cuisine, even though it originated elsewhere. The name of the dish in the Romanesco dialect eventually became matriciana due to the apheresis typical of this dialect.Ravaro (2005), p. 395 While tomato- less gricia is still prepared in central Italy, it is the tomato-enriched amatriciana that is better known throughout Italy and exported everywhere. While in Amatrice the dish is prepared with spaghetti, the use of bucatini has become extremely common in Rome and is now prevalent. Other types of dry pasta (particularly rigatoni) are also used, whereas fresh pasta is generally avoided. Variants The recipe is known in several variants depending, among other things, on the local availability of certain ingredients. In Amatrice, the use of guanciale and tomato, onion is not favored, but is shown in the classical handbooks of Roman cuisine.Boni (1983), pg. 44.Carnacina (1975), pg. 82. For frying, olive oil is most commonly used, but strutto (canned pork lard) is used as well. The addition of garlic sauteed in olive oil, before adding the guanciale is also accepted , and for cheese either pecorino romano or Amatrice's pecorino (from the Monti Sibillini or Monti della Laga areas) can be used.

The panchayat had been a municipality for a brief period of about two years before it was reverted to a panchayat in 1992 after skepticism that a municipality would attract higher tax rate and complexities of building rules. However, the municipal councils now have the authority to fix the tax rate while building rule provisions are already applicable to special grade Panchayats. The panchayat had passed a unanimous resolution for the elevation. In 2015, Kerala government elevated Piravom panchayat to a municipality along with several other towns in Kerala. Etymology There are two sources for the name piravom. It is believed that the name originated from the story of Adi Shankara's birth. The local legend says, the origin of the name piravom to this town got a connection with the birth of Sri Adi Sankaracharya. (Piravi in Malayalam means birth, Sri Sankara's birth made this place as Piravom). Mel Pazhoor Mana is believed as the birthplace of Adi Sankaracharya, which is the home of Aryamba, his holy mother. It is located in a place near Piravom, called Veliyanad, which got its name from 'Veliyam/Velicham konda nadu' which means the 'land where the light evolved' might be referring to Sankaracharyas birth and the light of knowledge thus originated and spread. The first one is related to the birth of Christ. As the strong belief in the area is that one of the three magi (3 kings) who went to see the child Jesus after his birth was from this place or passed through this place. Hence the three kings are highly revered in this area.

The story of the Three Biblical Magi Saint Caspar along with St. Melchior and St. Balthasar – From the pictorial encyclopedia Hortus Deliciarum by Herrad of Landsberg as reproduced by Christian Maurice Engelhardt There is a claim that one of the three Biblical Magi( represent the three wise men(Balthazar (magus), saint Caspar, saint Melchior) ) went from Piravom. Saint Caspar(otherwise known as St. Casper, St. Gaspar, St. Kaspar, St. Jaspar and other variations) along with St. Melchior and St. Balthasar, represent the three wise men (Biblical Magi) mentioned in the Bible in the Gospel of Matthew, verses 2:1–9. Although the Bible does not specify who or what the Magi were, since the seventh century, the Magi have been identified in the Western Church as Caspar, Melchior and Balthasar. St. Caspar and the other two are considered Saints by the Catholic Church. Some consider Caspar to be King Gondophares (AD 21 – c.AD 47) mentioned in the Acts of Thomas. Others consider him to have come from the southern parts of India where, according to tradition, Thomas the Apostle visited decades later. The town by name Piravom in Kerala State, Southern India has for long claimed that one of the three Biblical Magi went from there. There is a concentration of three churches named after the Biblical Magi in and around Piravom, as against only another three so named in the rest of India.

With the exception of Sweden, VRS has been provided in Europe for only a few years since the mid-2000s, and as of 2010 has not been made available in many European Union countries,European Union of the Deaf, EUD.eu website. with most European countries still lacking the legislation or the financing for large-scale VRS services, and to provide the necessary telecommunication equipment to deaf users. Germany and the Nordic countries are among the other leaders in Europe, while the United States is another world leader in the provisioning of VRS services.  Telecommunications-facilitated signing  One of the first demonstrations of the ability for telecommunications to help sign language users communicate with each other occurred when AT&T;'s videophone (trademarked as the \\"Picturephone\\") was introduced to the public at the 1964 New York World's Fair –two deaf users were able to communicate freely with each other between the fair and another city.Bell Laboratories RECORD (1969) A collection of several articles on the AT&T; Picturephone (then about to be released) Bell Laboratories, Pg.134–153 & 160–187, Volume 47, No. 5, May/June 1969. Various universities and other organizations, including British Telecom's Martlesham facility, have also conducted extensive research on signing via videotelephony.New Scientist. Telephones Come To Terms With Sign Language, New Scientist, 19 August 1989, Vol.123, Iss.No.1678, pp.31.Sperling, George. Bandwidth Requirements for Video Transmission of American Sign Language and Finger Spelling, Science, AAAS, November 14, 1980, Vol. 210, pp.797-799, .Whybray, M.W. Moving Picture Transmission at Low Bitrates for Sign Language Communication, Martlesham, England: British Telecom Laboratories, 1995. The use of sign language via videotelephony was hampered for many years due to the difficulty of its use over slow analogue copper phone lines, coupled with the high cost of better quality ISDN (data) phone lines. Those factors largely disappeared with the introduction of more efficient video codecs and the advent of lower cost high-speed ISDN data and IP (Internet) services in the 1990s. =21st century improvements= Significant improvements in video call quality of service for the deaf occurred in the United States in 2003 when Sorenson Media Inc. (formerly Sorenson Vision Inc.), a video compression software coding company, developed its VP-100 model stand-alone videophone specifically for the deaf community. It was designed to output its video to the user's television in order to lower the cost of acquisition, and to offer remote control and a powerful video compression codec for unequaled video quality and ease of use with video relay services. Favourable reviews quickly led to its popular usage at educational facilities for the deaf, and from there to the greater deaf community.Fitzgerald, Thomas J. For the Deaf, Communication Without the Wait, The New York Times, December 18, 2003. Coupled with similar high-quality videophones introduced by other electronics manufacturers, the availability of high speed Internet, and sponsored video relay services authorized by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission in 2002, VRS services for the deaf underwent rapid growth in that country. =Present-day usage= A deaf or hard-of- hearing person at his workplace using a VRS to communicate with a hearing person in London. Using such video equipment, the deaf, hard-of-hearing, and speech-impaired can communicate between themselves and with hearing individuals using sign language. The United States and several other countries compensate companies to provide video relay service (VRS). Telecommunication equipment can be used to talk to others via a sign language interpreter, who uses a conventional telephone at the same time to communicate with the deaf person's party. Video equipment is also used to do on-site sign language translation via video remote interpreting (VRI). The relative low cost and widespread availability of 3G mobile phone technology with video calling capabilities have given deaf and speech-impaired users a greater ability to communicate with the same ease as others. Some wireless operators have even started free sign language gateways. Sign language interpretation services via VRS or by VRI are useful in the present-day where one of the parties is deaf, hard-of-hearing, or speech-impaired (mute). In such cases the interpretation flow is normally within the same principal language, such as French Sign Language (LSF) to spoken French, Spanish Sign Language (LSE) to spoken Spanish, Swedish Sign Language (SSL) to spoken Swedish, German Sign Language (DGS) to spoken German, British Sign Language (BSL) to spoken English, and American Sign Language (ASL) also to spoken English (since BSL and ASL are completely distinct to each other), and so on. Sign language interpreting involves considerable effort on the part of the interpreter, since sign languages are distinct natural languages with their own construction, semantics and syntax, different from the aural version of the same principal language. Multilingual sign language interpreters, who can also translate as well across principal languages (such as from spoken Spanish, to spoken English, to ASL and vice versa), are also available, albeit less frequently. With video interpreting, sign language interpreters work remotely with live video and audio feeds, so that the interpreter can see the deaf or mute party, and converse with the hearing party, and vice versa. Much like telephone interpreting, video interpreting can be used for situations in which no on- site interpreters are available. However, video interpreting cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. VRS and VRI interpretation requires all parties to have the necessary equipment. Some advanced equipment enables interpreters to control the video camera remotely, in order to zoom in and out or to point the camera toward the party that is signing.  VRS deployment worldwide  =Video relay service platform vendors= Video Relay Services is based on three main factors: sign language interpreters, call center management (customer service, call center management), and platform provider (mobile app, servers). =Canada= Canada's regulatory Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) issued a policy order on July 21, 2009 requiring Canadian telecommunication, wireless service, and VoIP providers to implement IP-based text relay services by July 21, 2010, and also delaying a decision on the national provision of video relay services in both official languages (ASL & LSQ) for three years.Family Network for Deaf Children Newsletter, Family Network for Deaf Children, Burnaby, B.C., Fall 2009, pg.11.

The service can only be used on Windows-based units with use-license for the preinstalled software (MMX). 12K Studio was created and financed in 2011 by the nationwide sign language interpreter company, 12K A/S. The service can be used on Windows-, OS X/iOS-, Linux- and Android-based units (pc, mac and smartphones) with Skype and/or FaceTime app. 12K Studio service is primary offered to deaf people at their workplace, but can also be used in private for free. =France= There are two companies that provide VRS in France. France has legislated into a law the establishment of three VRS call centres to serve deaf and hard-of-hearing French consumers. However, the long-running disagreement in the French parliament on how to fund the service kept VRS from becoming a reality. The deaf and hard-of-hearing callers receive the personal budget that covers the cost of VRS and videophone equipment. The personal budget is stipulated for three-year period. Elioz is a providing both VRI and VRS in France. On the phone, in interview or in meeting, Elioz enables deaf, hard of hearing and hearing people to communicate in sign language, oral language, and writing using total conversation as a technical foundation of its services. Tadeo is a communication platform for use between hearing, deaf and hard-of-hearing persons in a professional environment; it offers a French Sign Language interpretation service, in Cued Speech, and live Transcription, remotely and real-time. Viable France was established in 2008 and bankrupt in 2015 by the deaf woman to provide VRS and VRI service in France. The company is fully independent of Viable, Inc. and has its own programming and engineering team. A distinction of Viable France is the sales and distribution of its own videophone product that was fully developed and engineered by the deaf engineers at Viable, Inc. Since October 8, 2018, the operators of the French Federation of Telecoms have launched the first interpersonal telecommunications service dedicated to the deaf, hearing-impaired, deafblind and aphasic, they can now phone independently with the application Rogervoice =Germany= Currently, Germany has two providers of VRS and VRI: they are TeSS and TeleSign. TeSS was created in 2005 by the consortium of Deutsche Gesellschaft der Hörgeschädigten (German Society of Hearing Impaired), Deutsche Telekom, Bundesnetzagenteur (federal infrastructure regulatory agency), and several other associations. Deutsche Telekom provided the initial funding for feasibility project that started in 2006. The deaf and hard-of- hearing clients who use the VRS for private calls must enrol with TeSS and arrange the payment method. They pay 14 eurocents per minute for text relay and 14 eurocents for video relay. TeSS operates around the clock (24/7). TeleSign provides the combined video relay and video remote interpreting service for the deaf and hard-of-hearing clients at work. The clients must apply to the integration agency for videophones and funds. The subscription is 220 euros per month with one point seven euro per minute of video relay service. The integration agency restricts the monthly call volume to 100 minutes per client. TeleSign operates from eight in the morning to six in the afternoon. TeSS has added the work-related VRS/VRI as to countereffect the demand of integration agency to switch from TeleSign to \\"cheaper\\" TeSS service. Despite the availability of VRS providers in Germany since 2006, the VRS usage is very extremely low as compared to other countries (no more than 3000 clients out of 80,000 deaf people). The integration agency is notorious for rejecting the applications many times on \\"cost benefit\\" factor: the agency claims that some deaf clients do not make sufficient VRS calls per month to justify the cost or that the nature of employment does not warrant the need for VRS and videophones. The deaf and hard-of-hearing callers who use VRS for private calls do not receive any form of reimbursement for the VRS calls. The grassroot movement is gaining momentum in pushing for the free VRS in Germany to be subsidised by the government through the contribution from the telecom companies. =Norway= NAV, or the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration provides the national relay service for Norway. The service started in 2008, and its usage is increasing. =Sweden= Sweden was the first country in the world to implement a public VRS fully subsidized by the government. The service started as a pilot project in 1996 for ISDN videophones, but started to offer SIP-based services in 2003. Currently the Swedish video relay service is the largest in Europe with an average of 110,000 minutes every month. There is one national service for the country, which is procured by bids to the National Telecom and Postal Agency (PTS) every four years. The service is provided by Evantia Oy, with call centers in Örebro, Uppsala and Gotland. Customers may download a video software application from the service provider, use a web-based application or access the service using Skype and third-party SIP software. =United Kingdom= A person at her workplace communicating with a hearing person via a Video Interpreter (VI) and use of sign language. Significan't (UK) Ltd, a deaf and sign language led social enterprise, was the first to establish an IP video relay service in 2004 in London. The SignVideo Contact Centre utilizes qualified and registered sign language interpreters and processed its 10,000th video call in 2006. It secured national contracts with Access to Work and the National Health Services to provide video remote interpreting services throughout the United Kingdom. In 2010 Significan't introduced the iSignVideo range of videophones and a web-based video calling service, the SignVideo SV2. This service is compliant with the concept of Total Conversation. connectSCOTLAND BSL is the national VRS service for Scotland and it is free- of-charge for its users. The service was procured by the Scottish Government and it complies with standards for Total Conversation. =United States= In the United States, VRS services have been regulated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) since 2002. Support for initial trials in Texas Ed Bosson of the Texas Public Utility Commission (PUC) envisioned deaf people communicating with videophones more than 10 years before the FCC began reimbursing for it. Bosson contacted Mark Seeger of Sprint Relay and discussed the possibilities. Seeger then contacted Sprint technicians to see if the proposal was feasible, and then suggested that Bosson bring the idea to Texas' PUC. It took Bosson considerable time to convince the Texas PUC and to enlist help from a lawyer in interpreting. He first convinced his supervisor and then, one-by-one, the PUC Commissioners that video relay should become a part of statewide Telecom Relay Service offering. Bosson was authorized to manage the first video relay service trials, and Sprint became the first service provider to conduct the Texas Video Relay Service tests. Bosson would later receive national awards from Smithsonian Computerworld and TDI for his work with VRS. Initial Texas trials In 1995, the first trial was run by Sprint in Austin and was limited to four public call centers. The second trial occurred in 1997 and served ten cities in Texas. At that point, Sprint and Hanwave Interpreting partnered to provide service. Jon Hodson of Sorenson Communications worked with Ed Bosson during the early stages and provided video conferencing software during the VRS trial in Texas. (At this point the service was called \\"Video Relay Interpreting\\" or VRI, which a name that now refers to Video Remote Interpreting. Linda Nelson has been credited with changing the term from VRI to VRS.) Later, Hanwave Interpreting Service was bought by Communication Service for the Deaf, and Sprint expanded their relay subcontract to include VRS services in addition to the established TRS services. In 2002, Washington and Texas tested a web based VRS, with CSDVRS providing VRS services via the Internet to Washingtonians. Implementation across the United States In 2000, VRS officially became available throughout the State of Texas. In 2002, the FCC allowed for the reimbursement of interstate VRS providers via an interstate TRS fund administration, making the United States the second country after Sweden to federally subsidize VRS nationwide. United States VRS regulation The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is the regulatory body for VRS in the United States. In addition to overseeing VRS, the FCC also oversees Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS), from which the VRS regulatory framework has evolved. The FCC oversees TRS and VRS as a result of their mandate in the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) to facilitate the provisions equal access to individuals with disabilities over the telephone network. The Interstate Telecommunications Relay Fund was created by the FCC to fund TRS and its scope was expanded to include VRS. Funding for the TRS comes from state tax, through rate adjustments or surcharge on local telephone bills. The tax on revenue is set by the FCC yearly and has been steadily increasing as the number of VRS minutes continues to climb. For 2007 the tax is 7.2/100ths of a penny per dollar of revenue, up from 3.8/100th of a penny in 2000. The current revenue tax of .0072 is expected to generate $553 million against telecommunications industry revenue of $76.8 billion. The fund is managed by National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA), which also administers the much larger Universal Service Fund and publishes the reimbursement rates paid to all relay providers. In addition to regulating the funding of VRS, the FCC regulates the standards that VRS companies and their employees must follow in handling calls. These regulations ensure that VRS calls are handled appropriately and ethically. The U.S. FCC-issued rulings include: * The time it takes an interpreter to answer an incoming VRS call. As of July 1, 2006, VRS providers must answer 80% of calls within two and a half minutes. Starting on January 1, 2007 VRS providers must answer 80% of calls within two minutes; * as of January 1, 2006, all VRS providers are required to provide service 24 hours a day, seven days a week; * reimbursement of VRS Video Mail: if a Hearing person calls a sign language user, but there is no answer, the VI signs a message and delivers it to the sign language user's e-mail, similar to an answering machine. Previously this service was not reimbursed and the cost was absorbed by the VRS provider; * VRS providers are not permitted to \\"call back\\" when a customer hangs up before a VRS call is placed; * VRS providers must only process calls that either originate or terminate in the US or its territories. For example, a person in Canada may use a VRS service in the United States to call a person in the United States, but not another person in Canada. 2005 U.S. FCC \\"Certification Program\\" On December 12, 2005, the Commission released an order adopting new rules permitting carriers desiring to offer IP Relay and VRS services and receive payment from the Fund to seek certification as a provider eligible for compensation from the Fund.REPORT AND ORDER AND ORDER ON RECONSIDERATION: Telecommunications Relay Services and Speech-to- Speech Services for Individuals with Hearing and Speech Disabilities, CG Docket No. 03-123, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, D.C., December 12, 2005.

The record reflects that other entities that desire to offer VRS have been unable to join a certified state program.Ex Parte Submission in the Matter of Telecommunications Relay Services and Speech-to-Speech Services for Individuals with Hearing and Speech Disabilities, Willkie, Farr & GallagHer LLC, June 7, 2005.

The rules further provide that after review of the submitted documentation, the Commission shall certify that the provider of IP Relay, VRS and IP CTS is eligible for compensation from the Fund if the Commission determines that the certification documentation: As of 2009 there have been six providers certified becoming eligible for reimbursement from the TRS fund under the rules advocated for by Daryl Crouse and supported by others in the industry. Issues in United States VRS administration * Numbering standardization competing VRS providers have incompatible numbering schemes. * Interconnection between the IP-based videophone network and the worldwide telephone network. * VRS providers encounter difficulties routing 911 calls to the appropriate Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). When a VRS user dials 911, the call is first delivered to the VRS, as with any other call placed. However, when the VRS interpreter attempts to connect with the user's local PSAP, the call is instead connected to the PSAP that services the VRS provider's location. Additionally, the information displayed at the PSAP will be that of the VRS provider, not the VRS user. In order to route emergency calls and accurate information to the appropriate PSAP, VRS providers can send the call information to a national call-routing service. This service determines the appropriate local PSAP for the VRS user and delivers the VRS interpreter's 911 call accordingly. The VRS user can then communicate with the PSAP dispatcher via the VRS interpreter, in order to receive the appropriate emergency services.911 Enable Partners with Snap!VRS to Provide Enhanced 911 Video Calling , 9-1-1 Enable website, VRS E911, June 20, 2008. The European Union improves access to emergency services 112 for people with disabilities. The REACH112 project intends to implement a 12-month pilot in Sweden, UK, The Netherlands, France and Spain allowing disabled users to communicate at a distance with each other and directly with the emergency services. * The VRS industry is under investigation by the FCC, U.S. Postal Inspection Service and FBI for alleged fraudulent activities meant to \\"manufacture\\" minutes. The FBI raided the offices of several VRS providers in June 2009 and consequently issued warrants and indictments for fraud.Twenty- six Charged in Nationwide Scheme to Defraud the FCC’s Video Relay Service Program, U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Public Affairs, November 19, 2009.

(DHIS), of New York and New Jersey ** Innovative Communication Services for the Deaf ** Tamara Frankel, Robert Rubeck, Benjamin Pena of Arizona  Technical details  =Typical calling procedure in the United States= Normally: # An individual who communicates by American Sign Language, or another mode of manual communication, such as Signing Exact English, contact signing (Pidgin Signed English), Cued Speech, or Linguistics of Visual English, uses a videophone or other video device, such as a webcam, to connect via broadband Internet to a Video Relay Service; # the caller is routed to a sign language interpreter, known as a Video Interpreter (VI). The VI is in front of a camera or videophone; # the video user gives the VI a voice number to dial, as well as any special dialing instructions; # the VI places the call and interprets as a neutral, non- participating third party. Anything that the audio user says is signed to the video user, and anything signed by the video user is spoken to the audio user; # once the call is over, the caller can make another call or hang up with the interpreter; # the company that provides the interpreter services will then submit billings to the FCC. Hearing people can also contact a deaf, hard-of- hearing, or speech-disabled person via VRS. To initiate a call, a hearing person calls a VRS and connects to a video interpreter who then contacts the video user. Some VRS services also offer: * Voice Carry Over: The video user may use his/her own voice instead of the interpreter speaking; * Hearing Carry Over: the video user may listen for him/herself instead of relying on the interpreter; * Language Preference: The video user requests that the interpreter use American Sign Language; * the ability to connect to a sign language interpreter who can interpret into another language, such as Spanish. =Videotelephony descriptive names & terminology= The name videophone is not as standardized as its earlier counterpart, the telephone, resulting in a variety of names and terms being used worldwide, and even within the same region or country. Videophones are also known as videotelephones (or video telephones) and often by an early trademarked name \\"Picturephone\\", which was the world's first commercial videophone produced in volume. The compound name \\"videophone\\" slowly entered into general use after 1950,Videophone definition, Merriam-Webster Online, retrieved April 13, 2009. although \\"video telephone\\" likely entered the lexicon earlier after \\"video\\" was coined in 1935.Video definition, Online Etymology Dictionary Videophone calls (also: videocalls and video chat),PC Magazine.

However that distinction has become increasingly blurred with technology improvements such as increased bandwidth and sophisticated software clients that can allow for multiple parties on a call. In general everyday usage the term videoconferencing is now frequently used instead of videocall for point-to-point calls between two units. Both videophone calls and videoconferencing are also now commonly referred to as a video link. Webcams are popular, relatively low cost devices which can provide live video and audio streams via personal computers, and can be used with many software clients for both video calls and videoconferencing.Solomon Negash, Michael E.

A videoconference (also known as a videoteleconference) allows two or more locations to communicate via live, simultaneous two-way video and audio transmissions. This is often accomplished by the use of a multipoint control unit (a centralized distribution and call management system) or by a similar non-centralized multipoint capability embedded in each videoconferencing unit. Again, technology improvements have circumvented traditional definitions by allowing multiple party videoconferencing via web-based applications.Lawson, Stephen.

History The Belém-Brasília Highway (BR-153 stretch) in the municipality of Fortaleza do Tabocão, Tocantins. The Belém-Brasília Highway was the first road built through the central and the middle north region of Brazil, having been built between 1958 and 1960, and paved in 1974. Its construction was one of the highest achievements of road engineering, due to the enormous difficulties faced by designing it and by the construction crews (more than 5,000 courses of water had to be conquered, and new ways of bulldozing and felling massive trees higher than 50 m and with girths exceeding 4 to 5 m in diameter had to be devised. Initially it was a dirt road, but in the succeeding years it was macadamized and more permanent bridges were built. The Belém-Brasília Highway was fundamental to bring modernity to a completely wild region. Many agricultural settlements and entire new cities, with its suite of commerce, industry, etc., sprang up along the highway. It was also the first land connection between the states of Pará, Maranhão, Tocantins and northern region of Goiás, with all the rest of the country, so that the economic potential and development of the region could be increased. In its beginning, a trip through the road was a dangerous undertaking, due to the presence of wild animals such as the ferocious spotted jaguars and poisonous snakes, and also of road banditry. There were no hotels, gasoline stations and restaurants along the highway and travellers had to carry their own supplies. Today, it entails a drive of approximately 2 days.

When OROV infects humans, it causes a rapid fever illness called Oropouche fever. OROV was originally reported in Trinidad and Tobago in 1955 from the blood sample of a fever patient and from a pool of Coquillettidia venezuelensis mosquitoes. In 1960, OROV was isolated from a sloth (Bradypus tridactylus) and a pool of Ochlerotatus (Ochlerotatus) serratus mosquitoes in Brazil. The virus is considered a public health threat in tropical and subtropical areas of Central and South America, with over half million infected people as of 2005. OROV is considered to be an arbovirus due to the method of transmission by the mosquitoes Aedes serratus and Culex quinquefasciatus among sloths, marsupials, primates, and birds. Epidemic Sites Between 1961 and 1980, OROV was reported in the northern state of Pará, Brazil, and from 1980 to 2004, OROV had spread to the Amazonas, Amapá, Acre, Rondônia, Tocantis, and Maranhão. The virus would cause Oropouche fever, an urban arboviral disease that has since resulted in >30 epidemics during 1960–2009. Virology Currently, based on the small segment (SRNA) genetic information, there are 4 major genotypes (I–IV) of OROV. Genotype I was isolated from strains in Acre, Amazonas, Maranhão, Tocantis, Pará, Trinidad, and Tobago. Genotype II was obtained during the spread in Amapá, Pará, Rondônia, and Peru. Genotype III was isolated from samples in Acre, Minas Gerais, Panama, and Rondônia. The final genotype IV was isolated from Amazonas. Dispersion A possible dispersal could be predicted for the four genotypes based on time-scaled analysis and epidemiologic data association. Genotype I possibly dispersed towards western Pará, Trinidad, and Tobago. After, genotype I progressed towards Amazonas, Acre, Maranhao, and Tocantins. Genotype II possibly emerged in Amapá, Pará, Rondônia, and Peru at the same time. Genotype III emerged in Rondônia, moved towards Panama, Acre, and Maranhão. From Maranhão, the genotype progressed towards Minas Gerais. Finally, genotype IV emerged from the city of Manaus and Amazonas. Experimentation and Research OROV has been used extensively in testing with Hela cells to study the mechanisms of apoptosis induced by the virus. It was found that OROV causes apoptosis by DNA fragmentation. In UV-inactivated OROV, virus-receptor binding was not enough and that viral uncoating and replication were needed to induce apoptosis.

The family fled Nazi Germany in the late 1930s and Kornhauser and his brother Jack migrated to Australia and settled in Melbourne. The brothers started a fur trading business called Arctic Furs and expanded to Sydney where Kornhauser became interested in property development. He built Kay House, the first inner city, post-war high rise and he also pioneered the planning of the Menzies Hotel in Sydney and built five Melbourne suburban hotels. Kornhauser moved to the Gold Coast in the early 1970s where he formed the HSP Property Group and began making his mark on the Gold Coast skyline. His best known project was the Paradise Centre in Surfers Paradise, which was built on the site of the original Surfers Paradise hotel. During the 1980s he had close links with the 'developer friendly' Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen government in Queensland, coming under scrutiny from the opposition and being accused in state parliament of money laundering. He was particularly close to the late Russ Hinze; and allegations that he paid money to Hinze family companies in return for corrupt business favours led to three formal corruption charges. In 1991 Kornhauser was acquitted of all charges after an eight-week trial in the Queensland District Court. According to the 2005 Business Review Weekly rich list, Kornhauser had an estimated fortune of $345 million.

Overview For winter sports, the term superpipe is used to describe a halfpipe built of snow which has walls high from the flat bottom on both sides. Other features of a superpipe are that the width of the pipe is greater than the height of the walls, and the walls extend to near vertical. In the FIS snowboard world cup rules, the recommended width for walls is . The term superpipe has evolved over the years as the size of halfpipes has grown. Originally, halfpipes were known as superpipes, but during the early 2000s, major competition organizers listened to rider feedback and began constructing 22' halfpipes for competitions. These became known as superpipes, and the 18' halfpipes they replaced are now known as standard halfpipes. The 22' wall size has proved very popular with athletes. The length of a superpipe ranges from to , depending on available terrain and construction funding. All halfpipes require extensive grooming by specialized equipment. In contrast, a natural snow halfpipe can be cleaned by a normal snow groomer. Because of the high expense of constructing and maintaining them, there are not that many halfpipes in the world, and very few true superpipes. During the 2013–2014 northern-hemisphere winter, only fourteen 22' superpipes existed globally. While 22' superpipes are standard for all major competitions, many ski resorts have halfpipes ranging in size from to . 18' is the most popular size globally for halfpipes.

It is commonly referred to as “RCPL” and is regarded as the most prestigious secondary school in Mauritius. Originally founded in 1799 during the French colonial period, the first stone of the school's current building at Cassis was laid by Princess Margaret during her first visit to Mauritius in 1956.Uteem Cassam. \\"Retrospective Royal College, Port- Louis – my alma mater\\", L'express, Mauritius, 25 July 2009. It only admits those having achieved the highest results at the Certificate of Primary Education exams – which corresponds to 4A*s at the Certificate of Primary Education exam. RCPL has a tradition of Higher School Certificate laureates who compete for state scholarships providing access to foreign tertiary education. History The creation of the college dates back to 1799 during the French colonisation period by Charles Isidor De Caen. The institution was then called \\"Lycée des Iles de France et de la Réunion\\", providing a primary and secondary education with a maximum capacity of 300 students.Kandasamy Pather. \\"Royal College (Port- Louis) – The history\\", Government of Mauritius, Mauritius, July 2009. In 1810, the island became an English colony. The institution's name was thus changed to \\"Lycée Colonial\\". As the English took full possession of the island, it became important for them to have an English name for the institution. Thus, in 1817, the college was renamed ‘’’Royal College Port Louis’’’ following a decree from His Majesty the King of England. In 1824, the college’s building was destroyed by a cyclone. Scholarships were briefly interrupted between 1827 and 1839. After that period, scholarships were reinstated and regularly given to student of each year. Until 1865, the exam boards were all run on the island itself. In 1866, a malaria epidemic broke out in the capital Port-Louis and the college was converted into a hospital. The college was thus relocated to a different area of Port-Louis which was later deemed not reputable by officers whose children were also studying at the college. The increasing number of students was also a problem for the new college as space was limited. So, on 1 May 1899, the Legislative Council moved the ‘’’Royal College Port Louis’’’ to Curepipe. On 1 October 1912, the foundation stone was laid in Curepipe by Director of Public Works Paul Le Juge de Segrais. The architecture was intended to be a smaller replica of the Buckingham Palace. Construction of the college in granite was completed by 1914. The new establishment was named Royal College School or simply La School. Due to the sheer number of pupils, the new branch also faced accommodation problems, leading to extension work. As the island's population grew significantly and to reduce commuting times for students living in the northern part of Mauritius and Port Louis the government built a second and brand-new college at a location close to the capital. Thus, in 1956, during her visit to the island Princess Margaret laid the first stone for the new and ultimate building of Royal College Port Louis'.Le Mauricien. \\"HISTOIRE: Le séjour de la princesse Margaret en 1956\\", Le Mauricien, Mauritius, September 2011. In 1970, the Royal College Port Louis swooped on all the 4 State Scholarships at stake on the boys' side (Also, that year, The Loreto College of Curepipe secured 1 scholarship and the other one was obtained by the Queen Elizabeth College.) In 1973, the Royal College Port Louis was honorably chosen to host the OCAMM Summit ('Organisation Commune Africaine, Malgache et Mauricienne'). 1979 marked the history of Royal College Port Louis as the school's 50th Anniversary was celebrated with great pomp, with some of the highest dignitaries of the island, including the then Prime Minister. In December 1999, in the context of its 70th anniversary, the Royal College Port Louis was honoured with 'The Medal of the City of Port-Louis'. A grand ceremony took place at the Municipality to mark the occasion. Later, in 2001, the school had the visit of the Manchester United Academy team. Two years later, Royal College Port Louis became a 'Form Six School' with no students admitted in Form 1. Yet, in 2005, the school underwent a change – Form 1 classes were reintroduced in Royal College Port Louis (and other 'star schools' such as Royal College Curepipe, Queen Elizabeth College, John Kennedy College). Thus, the school became a 'national college' and it was then in January 2007 that the first batch of Form 1 students after the reform were admitted. Present day Both Royal Colleges, Royal College Port-Louis and Royal College Curepipe share a common origin and students of the two elite institutions tend to consider each other with a twist of rivalry – similar to the Oxford–Cambridge rivalry in the United Kingdom. Both colleges’ students are customarily called Royalists. Scholarships are attributed to the 14 best pupils (boy's side) of the island for their high school certificate performances and the two institutions normally share most of the scholarships annually.

Between 2016-2020, four or more students matriculated to Cornell, Columbia, University of Chicago, Georgetown, Brown, Barnard, Carnegie Mellon, Washington University in St Louis and NYU. The first women's higher education institution in the United States, it was founded by women's rights advocate Emma Willard in 1814 (as the Troy Female Seminary). As of 2019, it had an endowment of $105,569,594. In 2018, the school was ranked by The Post-Standard as the #1 private school in Upstate New York. Academics Emma Willard is an independent college-preparatory day and boarding school enrolling students in grades 9–12 and post-graduate studies. Class sizes are kept at a 16-student maximum; the typical student to teacher ratio is 6 to 1. 83 percent of faculty hold advance degrees. Advanced Placement preparation is offered in all disciplines. Students also may enroll in college-level courses at neighboring Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Most students take five courses each semester. Classes meet four or five times each week for fifty minutes, though lab sciences, seminars, and AP sections meet for varying lengths of time. An ESL program offers intermediate and advanced- level curriculum for international students. Core requirements for graduation include a minimum of four units of English; three units of history, foreign language, mathematics; two units of lab science (one each in biology and physics), two units in the arts, and one-fourth unit in health. All students must fulfill a community service requirement and take physical education or its equivalent each semester in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh grades. Seniors must take at least ten weeks. Emma Willard offers inquiry-based classes across all disciplines. In the fall of 2005, Emma Willard began its Physics First program for all incoming ninth-grade students. It has students take a basic physics course in the ninth grade rather than the biology course that is standard in most public schools. Educational philosophy The guiding educational philosophy, known on campus as EMpowerment, teaches that every young woman who attends Emma Willard will be encouraged to develop fully in all areas of her life, as a strong intellectual in a variety of disciplines, as a practitioner of her chosen passions, as a social member of the community, and as a responsible global citizen in her future. In keeping with that philosophy of personal development providing its own benchmarks, class rank is not provided. The grading system uses letter and number grades. It goes as follows: A, A−, B+, B, B−, C+, C, C−, etc., accompanied usually by a number indicating where on the spectrum the individual student falls. Emma Willard's independent-study program, Practicum, allows students to pursue coursework at area colleges, career internships, community service, and individualized athletic training and competition off-campus for academic credit. Over one- third of the students participate in Practicum each year. Emma Willard students worked to make Emma Willard School the first fair trade high school in the United States in 2010. History In 1821, Emma Hart Willard opened the Troy Female Seminary in Troy, New York, to provide young women with the same higher education as their male peers. Prior to the school's founding, young women had been unable to pursue the advanced curricular offerings in mathematics, classical languages and the sciences that were taught to their male counterparts. Her husband, John Willard managed the school's finances and served as the in-house physician until his death in 1825. Having taught for several years, Emma Willard perceived the egregious disparity in what girls learned compared to boys. In 1819, Willard promoted a comprehensive secondary and post-secondary female educational institution, which would require funding by the State of New York. Her address to the office of New York's \\"innovative\\" governor DeWitt Clinton met with initial success. However, the New State legislature at Albany, on hearing her request, responded with mixed sentiment, and ultimately rejected her proposal. Many of the wives of prominent men steadfastly supported and promoted her educational agenda to their friends and associates. Thereafter, the City of Troy's Common Council eventually raised $4,000 that would facilitate Willard's purchase of a suitable flagship building for her proposed seminary for young women. She had already obtained inexpensive accommodation in a nearby historic (already for the 1800s) Waterford, New York, landmark farm. There, she rented two nondescript long and narrow stone structures, former pre-Colonial Dutch estate's outbuildings in a picturesque setting along the mighty Mohawk River. The property's border still abuts the Erie Canal's first but long-defunct stone lock, near a major point of the Mohawk's primary arterial confluence into the Hudson River. However, in early 1821, a critical funds shortage from to a brief economic downturn that had affected the region forced her to close her Waterford Academy. Toward the close of 1821, Willard secured $4,000 in funding and relocated to Troy, downstream from Watertown along the Hudson River. The Albany Academy for Boys had been established in March 1813, just downstream from Waterford and her temporary school; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) opened in 1824. She was able to formally found the Troy Female Seminary \\"for young ladies of means\\", becoming \\"the first school in the country to provide girls the same educational opportunities given to boys\\". From its establishment in 1821 until 1872, the seminary admitted 12,000 students. The Troy Female Seminary promoted the education of young girls as well as women teachers in training. The seminary provided tuition on credit for students who could not afford it, with the agreement that those students would be teaching assistants and eventually become teachers themselves.Scott, Anne F. \\"What, Then, is the American: This New Woman?.\\" The Journal of American History 65 (1978): 679–703 That type of on-credit tuition led to the growing reputation of the Troy Female Seminary as the demand for female teachers increased during the nineteenth century. Willard advocated for publicly supported female seminaries by asserting the necessity of educating as many women as possible in the United States, a task, she pointed out, that was too large for private institutions alone to undertake. Willard also promoted educational reform by emphasizing that women were capable of intellectual evidence in any field and demanded for women to be trained for professions.Scott, Anne F. \\"The Ever Widening Circle: The Diffusion of Feminist Values from the Troy Female Seminary 1822–1872\\" History of Education Quarterly 19 (1979): 3–25 The school was immediately successful, and it graduated many great thinkers, including noted social reformer and suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Willard remained the head of the seminary until 1838, when she handed it over to her son. In 1895, the school was renamed The Emma Willard School for Girls. In 1910, a new campus was built for the school on Mount Ida. =Educational philosophy and academics= Her educational philosophy for the Troy Female Seminary was to \\"educate the women for responsible motherhood and train some of them to be teachers,\\" with a curriculum that was similar to the contemporary men's colleges. The curriculum included courses in mathematics, science, modern languages, Latin, history, philosophy, geography, and literature. The Troy Female Seminary School also provided the services of Normal Schools by giving women the opportunity to become teacher's assistants and spread women's education throughout the United States. The alumnae of the Troy School were unusual among contemporary women in their pursuit of work beyond the \\"private sphere\\" of the home. These alumnae established numerous Normal Schools, institutions that promoted the study of arts and sciences, and expanded into other professions involving the sciences and law. Co-curricular pursuits Co-curricular pursuits include sports, choir, orchestra, a cappella groups, the student newspaper, a literary arts magazine (Triangle), model UN, county-champion Mock Trial team, speech and debate, quiz team, various clubs, and the yearbook, among others. As it is a fair trade school, students from EcoEmm Fair Trade Club study global social justice issues and help educate the community, as well as sell fair trade goods at the school. Students also sign petitions fighting human rights abuses worldwide. Each year, students and faculty take service trips to countries in the developing world so Emma's women can see the world and make the changes they discuss in their classrooms throughout the year. Emma Willard is also the first boarding school to become a member of the international Round-Square program. In 2009, students and faculty traveled to Africa and to Casa de los Angeles in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, to care for the children of poor working mothers.  Traditions  Every year, the senior class conduct a play called Revels. The plot mimics a medieval Christmas celebration set in a manor house. The parts are kept secret until the play. The first Revels performance was in 1915. The seniors also control a patch of triangular grass in the center of campus called the Senior Triangle. Only seniors and alumnae are permitted to walk on the grass unless invited by a senior or alumnae. Juniors \\"takeover\\" this patch of grass after the senior leave for senior retreat at the end of the year during Triangle Takeover. Juniors receive their class ring through their ring sister, who dresses them up throughout Ring Week and gives a half a quote to a member of the faculty for them to find before the week commences with Ring Dinner in which the ring is presented. Other traditions include hall tea where once a week students gather with their halls to bond; Eventide, the winter concert; sophomore tree decorating; Peanuts and Shells (a version of secret Santa); May Day, in which freshman participate in a maypole dance and a May Queen who is voted on by the student body is crowned; and Principal's Play Day, a secret day chosen by the head of school in which class is cancelled. Student demographics Girls currently hail from 24 states, and over 36 foreign countries.\\"Emma Willard School Profile.\\" https://bbk12e1-cdn.myschoolcdn.com/ftpimages/1098/misc/misc_173685.pdf In fall 2010 enrollment increased by 3%; the total student population was 319 (203 boarding, 116 day).

The three oldest buildings, all of collegiate Gothic style, include a cathedral-like reading room, classrooms, offices, a main auditorium, a dance studio, a lab theater, three residence halls, dining facility, a student center, and a chapel. A modern art, music, and library complex opened in 1967. The library holds more than 34,000 volumes and 77 print and online periodical subscriptions. Athletic facilities include a gymnasium with two basketball/volleyball/ indoor tennis courts, full facilities for fitness training and aerobic dance, a weight room, an aquatics center housing a competition-size pool, three large playing fields, and an all-weather track. The three-story Hunter Science Center houses laboratories and teaching facilities for chemistry, biology, physics, and mathematics. Approximately 75 percent of the faculty reside on campus in houses and apartments. There are two main dormitory halls, Kellas and Sage. There are 10 residential faculty members. Students may also live in Cluett House, a \\"residential experience for students who are interested in creating positive world change\\". The school was used as a filming location for the films The Emperor's Club (as St. Benedict's Academy) and Scent of a Woman (as Baird School), as well as episodes of Homeland on Showtime. In both films, the school is portrayed as an all-boys school, and becomes co-ed in the later- years section of The Emperor's Club. Homeland uses the campus as C.I.A. headquarters. It is also the setting in the novel City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert. Athletics Emma Willard has thirteen interscholastic sports teams: badminton, field hockey, soccer, volleyball, tennis, cross country, swimming, diving, basketball, lacrosse, softball, crew, and track (indoor and outdoor). In 2019, there were 29 athletic coaches and affiliated personnel at Emma Willard.

The band's music contains influences from music around the world, with an emphasis on South American flute sounds and melodies. Cusco's melodic and energetic music is a fusion of modern and ethnic styles with influences from classical music and rock music sensibilities. Most of the ethnic instruments were keyboard-generated, giving the sound of real quality. The band was led by founders Michael Holm (Lothar Bernhard Walter; 1943–) and Kristian Schultze (1945–2011). Michael Holm, already a successful vocal artist, sought to make a musical tribute to ancient cultures. He and Kristian Schultze, formerly a member of the jazz band Passport, shared musical and historical interests. In 1979, they formed Cusco, and released their first album in 1980. They eventually signed with Higher Octave Music, releasing their first album on that label in 1988. Their albums consistently reached very high peaks on the instrumental/new age music sales charts. They were nominated for a Grammy award three times. Cusco's music was frequently used as pre-show background music in Epcot prior to IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth, and has been used as bumper music for the popular American syndicated radio program Coast to Coast AM, as well as several television advertisements, including a Bud Ice beer commercial. Additionally, Cusco composed and performed symphonic new age music for the German television special Sielmann 2000. Until his death in 2011, Schultze resided in Weilheim in Oberbayern, Germany; Holm still lives there.

History Sunny Lax debuted on the music scene with the 12\\" P.U.M.A. / Cassiopeia EP as his debut release on Anjunabeats in February 2006, which was widely played by highly esteemed DJs such as Paul van Dyk and Armin van Buuren. Music and programming had been a major part of Levente's early life, and at the age of 13 he started producing music of his own without any prior music theory knowledge. After buying a few programming books from his pocketbook, he learnt about music software, notably the \\"Modeplug Tracker\\", and started to program his own music. He began to compete in various remix competitions in his native Hungary, performing well and boosting his self-esteem. This encouraged Levente to send one of his productions, P.U.M.A., to several music labels, where Anjunabeats agreed to sign it. Sunny Lax's third single, \\"M.I.R.A.\\", was released on Anjunabeats on October 9, 2006. This was followed up with by \\"Blue Bird\\" on May 21, 2007. In 2013, Sunny Lax launched his own record label \\"Sounds of Elysium\\" as a sublabel of Blue Soho Recordings, which would mainly feature progressive trance tracks.

The article was created on November 8, 2004, and was exposed as a hoax 16 months later when it was deleted on February 5, 2006. The article was ten sentences long while it existed on Polish Wikipedia. It gained some prominence after stories about it appeared in prominent Polish newspapers (Gazeta Wyborcza) and magazines (Przekrój), as well as a British one (The Observer). The article also falsely claimed a street in Warsaw was named \\"Henryk Batuta Street\\", after the fictional communist official. The anonymous hoaxers who created the article, according to the press calling themselves \\"The Batuta Army\\" (pl. \\"Armia Batuty\\"), allegedly wanted to draw attention to the fact that there are still places in Poland named after former communist officials who \\"do not deserve the honour\\". The hoax was exposed when the article was listed for deletion. Even after the article was exposed as a well-organized hoax, its perpetrators tried to convince others of its authenticity by providing false bibliographical information and even by uploading a doctored photograph of a street name \\"ulica Henryka Batuty\\" (Henryk Batuta Street). The mystification was \\"officially\\" exposed and confirmed on 9 February 2006, when the Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza and weekly Przekrój published their articles about the hoax. There is an \\"ulica Batuty\\" (Batuta Street) in Warsaw; however, the name comes from the Polish word \\"batuta\\", which means \\"conductor's baton\\". In this area of the Służew district there are many street names relating to music and this is one of them.Article on the Służewiec nad Dolinką District with mention of its musical street names, including the Batuta Str:  Content of the hoax article  An English translation of the hoax article as it appeared on the Polish Wikipedia on 1 February 2006, when it was finally exposed as a hoax.Henryk Batuta article on the Polish Wikipedia, 1 February 2006. > Henryk Batuta, real name Izaak Apfelbaum, (born 1898 in Odessa – died 1947 > near Ustrzyki Górne) was a Polish communist and an activist in the > international workers' movement.

He is a professor at Texas A&M; University and Princeton University. Additionally, in 2012 he developed a lab at the Baylor Research and Innovation Collaborative in Waco, Texas. He has authored over 700 scientific articles, as well as standard textbooks such as “Laser Physics” (with W. Lamb and M. Sargent) and “Quantum Optics” (with M. S. Zubairy). Education Scully was born in Casper, Wyoming, where he attended public schools including Casper College, and finished his undergraduate studies at the University of Wyoming and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He received his PhD under the guidance of Willis Lamb at Yale University in 1965. Career After completing his graduate work at Yale University, Scully became an instructor at Yale and then proceeded to become an assistant professor at MIT, where he received early promotion to associate professor and moved to the University of Arizona to become professor before age 30. While there, he worked with Willis Lamb, Peter Franken, and others to build the Optical Sciences Center there. In 1980, he took a joint position between the Max Planck Institute für Quantenoptik and the University of New Mexico as distinguished professor. In the early 1990s, he moved to Texas A&M;, where he is now Burgess Distinguished Professor of Physics, holds the TEES Distinguished Research chair, and is director of the Center for Theoretical Physics and the Institute for Quantum Studies. In 2003, he was appointed visiting professor at Princeton University. In 2005, he accepted a joint professional appointment between Texas A&M; and Princeton Universities. The Scully-Lamb quantum theory of the laser was the first theoretical treatment which yielded the laser photon statistics, the laser linewidth, and all higher order photon correlations. It was later extended to explain behavior of the single photon maser. Most recently, Scully and coworkers have shown that the laser master equation analysis also provides a good quantitative description of fluctuations in the Bose–Einstein condensate. The foundation of quantum mechanics is another area which Scully has made pioneering contributions. Aharonov and Zubairy in their 2005 Science article on \\"Time and the Quantum\\" describe one facet of his work as follows: > \\"The quantum eraser effect of Scully and Drühl dramatically underscores the > difference between our classical conceptions of time and how quantum > processes can unfold in time. Such eyebrow-raising features of time in > quantum mechanics have been.. . described ‘as one of the most intriguing > effects in quantum mechanics’.. . The quantum eraser concept has been > studied and extended in many different experiments and scenarios, for > example, the entanglement quantum eraser, the kaon quantum eraser, and the > use of quantum eraser entanglement to improve microscopic resolution.\\" A rather unorthodox feature of his career is his strong combination of theoretical and experimental science. For example, Scully and colleagues were the first to make lasers oscillate without population inversion and have extended the coherent Raman spectroscopy techniques to detect anthrax type endospores. In addition, Scully is long time cattle rancher known for his research in the United States and abroad, e.g., Mongolia, into beef cattle production. This unlikely combination of activities and interests has resulted in his being dubbed the \\"quantum cowboy.\\" In addition to his seven US Patents in laser physics, he holds a US Patent (5,198,222) titled \\"Time Release Bolus,\\" which is a device for slowly delivering medicine or nutrients into the stomach of a cow. Recognition Scully is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, the Academia Europaea, and the Max Planck Society. He has also received numerous awards including the Adolph E. Lomb Medal of the OSA in 1970, the Elliott Cresson Medal of the Franklin Institute in 1990, the Charles Hard Townes Award of the OSA in 1998, the Quantum Electronics Award of IEEE in 2003,Quantum Electronics Award of IEEE a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Alexander von Humboldt Distinguished Faculty Prize, the APS Arthur L. Schawlow Prize in 2005, and has been appointed to a Harvard Loeb Lectureship. In 2011, Scully was honored with the Herbert Walther Award and in 2012 with the Frederic Ives Medal of the OSA. In December 2016, he has been elected as a Foreign Member Of Russian Academy of Sciences. Life His wife Judith Bailey Scully and he have three sons: James, an American Airline captain; Robert, a writer and Caterpillar diesel mechanic; and Steven, an electrical engineer with Dallas Semiconductor. Rob (with an introduction by his father) wrote a book entitled “The Demon and the Quantum: From the Pythagorean Mystics to Maxwell's Demon and Quantum Mystery” which was published by Wiley-VCH in October 2007. The book is directed toward the layperson as well as the professional physicist and examines the connection between Maxwell's Demon and the role of the observer and quantum eraser.Marlan is a Christian.

He also served as rector of the colleges at Trigueros and Cádiz. Arias was commonly regarded as a saint, and was known for his gift of prayer and his spirit of penance. He was especially devoted to the care of blacks, Moors, and the inmates of hospitals and prisons.

The violet- blue gem was given to silent film actress Mary Pickford by her husband, Douglas Fairbanks. She bequeathed it to the Smithsonian Institution. It is the namesake of the popular alcoholic beverage Bombay Sapphire, a British- manufactured gin.  Description  The Star of Bombay is a 182 carat (36.4-g) cabochon-cut star sapphire. According to Southern Jewelry News, \\"The Star of Bombay sapphire belongs to the mineral species corundum. Pure corundum is colorless, but trace amounts of transition elements like vanadium or chromium result in different colors in the crystal. The Star of Bombay’s violet-blue color is caused by the presence of titanium and iron giving the blue tint, and vanadium contributing to its violet back color.\\"  History  The Star of Bombay originates from Sri Lanka and is one of the largest star sapphires which have names unrelated to their origin, the other being the Star of India. It is the namesake of the popular alcoholic beverage Bombay Sapphire, a British-manufactured gin. The gem was first acquired by Trabert & Hoeffer Inc. of Park Avenue in New York City and was set in a platinum ring. It is believed that the ring was purchased by Douglas Fairbanks, a famous silent film movie star and that he would give the ring to Mary Pickford. A 1935 advertisement for the Star of Bombay had it listed at 60 carats and did not include information on its origins and described it as \\"In all the world the only one\\". In 1979, Mary Pickford died and bequeathed the Star of Bombay, to the Smithsonian Museum. Edward Stotsenberg of the Mary Pickford Foundation called the Smithsonian and a representative was sent out to examine the stone. According to Stotsenberg, the representative stated that the Star of Bombay was much brighter than other stones and pried it from the clasps and returned to the Smithsonian with it. The gem is currently displayed in the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, in the Janet Annenberg Hooker Hall of Geology, Gems and Minerals.

Extremely popular, the play was kept running continuously for years by seven road companies.\\"The McVay Farewell.\\" Honolulu Commercial Advertiser, June 20, 1899. Among antebellum melodramas, it was considered second in popularity only to Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852).\\"McVay in The Octoroon.\\" Honolulu Evening Bulletin, June 20, 1899. Boucicault adapted the play from the novel The Quadroon by Thomas Mayne Reid (1856). It concerns the residents of a Louisiana plantation called Terrebonne, and sparked debates about the abolition of slavery and the role of theatre in politics. It contains elements of Romanticism and melodrama. The word octoroon signifies a person of one-eighth African ancestry. In comparison, a quadroon would have one quarter African ancestry and a mulatto for the most part has historically implied half African ancestry. The Oxford English Dictionary cites The Octoroon with the earliest record of the word \\"mashup\\" with the quote: \\"He don't understand; he speaks a mash up of Indian, French, and Mexican.\\" (Boucicault's manuscript actually reads \\"Indian, French and 'Merican.\\" The last word, an important colloquialism, was misread by the typesetter of the play.) Plot =Act I= George Peyton returns to the United States from a trip to France to find that the plantation he has inherited is in dire financial straits as a result of his late uncle's beneficence. Jacob McClosky, the man who ruined Judge Peyton, has come to inform George and his aunt (who was bequeathed a life interest in the estate) that their land will be sold and their slaves auctioned off separately. Salem Scudder, a kind Yankee, was Judge Peyton's business partner; though he wishes he could save Terrebonne, he has no money. George is courted by the rich Southern belle heiress Dora Sunnyside, but he finds himself falling in love with Zoe, the daughter of his uncle through one of the slaves. Dora, oblivious to George's lack of affection for her, enlists Zoe's help to win him over. McClosky desires Zoe for himself, and when she rejects his proposition, he plots to have her sold with the rest of the slaves, for he knows that she is an octoroon and is legally part of the Terrebonne property. He plans to buy her and make her his mistress. =Act II= McClosky intercepts a young slave boy, Paul, who is bringing a mailbag to the house which contains a letter from one of Judge Peyton's old debtors. Since this letter would allow Mrs. Peyton to avoid selling Terrebonne, McClosky kills Paul and takes the letter. The murder is captured on Scudder's photographic apparatus. Paul's best friend, the Indian Wahnotee, discovers Paul's body; he can speak only poor English, however, and is unable to communicate the tragedy to anyone else. George and Zoe reveal their love for each other, but Zoe rejects George's marriage proposal. When George asks why, Zoe explains that she is an octoroon, and the law prevents a white man from marrying anyone with the smallest black heritage. George offers to take her to a different country, but Zoe insists that she stay to help Terrebonne; Scudder then appears and suggests that George marry Dora. With Dora's wealth, he explains, Terrebonne will not be sold and the slaves will not have to be separated. George reluctantly agrees. =Act III= George goes to Dora and begins to propose to her; while he is doing so, however, he has a change of heart and decides not to lie to her. He and Zoe admit to their love of each other; a heartbroken Dora leaves. The auctioneer arrives, along with prospective buyers, McClosky among them. After various slaves are auctioned off, George and the buyers are shocked to see Zoe up on the stand. McClosky has proved that Judge Peyton did not succeed in legally freeing her, as he had meant to do. Dora then reappears and bids on Zoe – she has sold her own plantation in order to rescue Terrebonne. McClosky, however, outbids her for Zoe; George is restrained from attacking him by his friends. =Act IV= The buyers gather to take away the slaves they have purchased on a steamship. They have realized that Paul is missing, and most believe him dead. Wahnotee appears, drunk and sorrowful, and tells them that Paul is buried near them. The men accuse Wahnotee of the murder, and McClosky calls for him to be lynched. Scudder insists that they hold a trial, and the men search for evidence. Just as McClosky points out the blood on Wahnotee's tomahawk, the oldest slave, Pete, comes to give them the photographic plate which has captured McClosky's deed. The men begin to call for McClosky to be lynched, but Scudder convinces them to send him to jail instead. =Act V= The men leave to fetch the authorities, but McClosky escapes. Stealing a lantern, he sets fire to the steamship that had the slaves on board. Wahnotee tracks him down and confronts him; in the ensuing struggle, Wahnotee kills McClosky. Back at Terrebonne, Zoe returns but with a sad heart, as she knows that she and George can never be together. In an act of desperation she drinks a vial of poison, and Scudder enters to deliver the good news that McClosky was proven guilty of murdering Paul and that Terrebonne now belongs to George. Despite the happiness Zoe stands dying and the play ends with her death on the sitting-room couch and George kneeling beside her. Alternative endings When the play was performed in England it was given a happy ending, in which the mixed-race couple are united. The tragic ending was used for American audiences, to avoid portraying a mixed marriage.How to End \\"The Octoroon\\", John A.

Chola Empire  The genealogy of the Chola empire as found in the Tamil literature and in the many inscriptions left by the later Chola kings contains a number of kings recorded for whom there is no verifiable historic evidence. There are as many versions of this lineage as there are sources for them. The main source is the Sangam literature – particularly, religious literature such as Periapuranam, semi-biographical poems of the later Chola period such as the temple and cave inscription and left by medieval Cholas. Irrespective of the source, no list of the kings has a high level of historic fact and, while they generally are similar to each other, no two lists are exactly the same. Modern historians consider these lists not as historically reliable sources but as comprehensive conglomerations of various Hindu deities and Puranic characters attributed to local chieftains and invented ancestry of dynasty attempting to re-establish their legitimacy and supremacy in a land they were trying to conquer.  Prehistorical Cholas  A number of typical hero and demi-gods found their place in the ancestry claimed by the later Cholas in the long typical genealogies incorporated into the copper-plate charters and stone inscription of the tenth and eleventh centuries. The earliest version of this is found in the kilbil Plates which gives fifteen names before Chola including the genuinely historical ones of Karikala, Perunarkilli and Kocengannan. The Thiruvalangadu Plate swells this list to forty-four, and the Kanya Plate runs up to fifty-two. The Cholas were looked upon as descended from the sun. These myths speak of a Chola king, supposed contemporary of the sage Agastya, whose devotion brought the river Kavery into existence. There is also the story of the king Manu Needhi Cholan who sentenced his son to death for having accidentally killed a calf. He was called thus because he followed the rules of Manu; his real name is not mentioned and is thought to be Ellalan according to Maha vamsam who was also attributed with a similar story. King Shivi who rescued a dove from a hunter by giving his own flesh to the hungry and poor hunter was also part of the early Chola legends. King Shivi was also called Sembiyan, a popular title assumed by a number of Chola kings.  Cholas of the Sangam period  The early Chola kings of the Sangam period and the life of people contributed much to the cultural wealth of the Tamil country. The Sangam literature is full of legends about the mythical Chola kings. However, there is no basis for this list of Kings either by way of inscriptions or by way of literary evidence (even in Sangam literature). kindly note that no citation or other proof is given for this list. The dates of accession are approximate interpolation of the Chronological standpoints in Tamil history. * Eri Oliyan Vaendhi C. 3020 BCE * Maandhuvaazhi C. 2980 BCE * El Mei Nannan C. 2945 BCE * Keezhai Kinjuvan C. 2995 BCE * Vazhisai Nannan C. 2865 BCE * Mei Kiyagusi Aerru C. 2820 BCE * Aai Kuzhi Agusi Aerru C. 2810 BCE * Thizhagan Maandhi C. 2800 BCE * Maandhi Vaelan C. 2770 BCE * Aai Adumban C. 2725 BCE * Aai Nedun jaet chozha thagaiyan C. 2710 BCE * El Mei Agguvan a.k.a.

Therese Huber (7 May 1764 – 15 June 1829) was a German author. She was one of the so-called ', a group of five academically active women during the mid-18th and early 19th centuries. The group consisted of daughters of academics at Göttingen University; Huber was noteworthy among them, alongside Meta Forkel-Liebeskind, Caroline Schelling, Philippine Engelhard, and Dorothea Schlözer. Life Therese Huber (unknown artist) Therese Huber was born Marie Therese Heyne in Göttingen as daughter of the influential classical philologist Christian Gottlob Heyne and his first wife Therese (1730-1775), the daughter of lutenist and composer Sylvius Leopold Weiss. She married traveller and ethnologist Georg Forster in 1785. They lived in Wilno 1785–1787 and in Göttingen and Mainz 1788–1792 and had three children, but an unhappy marriage. After Forster had left Mainz for Paris as representative of the Mainz Republic, she and her lover Ludwig Ferdinand Huber, who had been living with the Forsters in Mainz, moved to Neuchâtel, living under difficult conditions there. She and Forster met for the last time in 1793, when he agreed to a divorce. However, Forster died soon after, and she married her lover. After his 1804 death, she moved in with her daughter in Ulm. Huber died in 1829 in Augsburg. The most notable of her ten children, six of which survived, was social reformer Victor Aimé Huber. Works Huber's main work consists of novels, novellas, and travel reports, at first published under her husband Ludwig's name. However, she was also working as editor of the Morgenblatt für gebildete Stände (Morning paper for the educated classes), as translator, and as essayist. Furthermore, she wrote over 4500 letters to many important contemporaries, about a wide range of topics. Later in her life, Huber edited the works and letters of both of her husbands. Her novel, Abentheuer auf einer Reise nach Neu-Holland [Adventures on a Voyage to New Holland] was serialized in the 1793-1794 issues of the German women's magazine, Flora: part of the tale was set in Norfolk Island, which thus made its first appearance in a work of fiction. Georg Forster had been one of the party of the first Europeans ever to set foot on Norfolk Island when it was discovered in October 1774 during James Cook's second voyage, and Therese had drawn on his description of it in his Reise um die Welt.Flora: Teutschlands Töchtern geweiht von Freunden und Freundinnen des schönen Geschlechts, 4 (1793) 241-74; 1 (1794) 7-43, 209-75; cited in Robert J.

He was a Beatles fan until the age of eleven when he first listened to Frank Sinatra's seminal \\"Songs for Swingin' Lovers\\". Gordon's first-ever visit to a major jazz concert was in 1973 to see Duke Ellington performing at the Usher Hall in Edinburgh. His second was on April 11, 1974 to see Ella Fitzgerald at The Apollo in Glasgow. Recently, the Ella Fitzgerald Charitable Foundation included Gordon's off- and on- stage encounters with Ella Fitzgerald. Gordon collected every album by Sinatra before broadening his interest into jazz and many other renowned singers and instrumentalists. Over a 20-year period Gordon immersed himself in The Great American Songbook and would acquire a repertoire of well over a thousand songs. In 1975 he met Ella Fitzgerald. He was also fortunate to meet Bing Crosby, Rosemary Clooney, Count Basie, Woody Herman, George Shearing and Tony Bennett. His primary interest in music was as singing type which was passionate yet private. In 2000 he participated in a week-long vocal jazz workshop that would change his performance approach. One year later he performed at Scotland’s best jazz club. In 2003 he was booked to open for Dionne Warwick during her UK tour and subsequently gave up his \\"day job\\" as an exhibition organizer to perform full-time. Gordon has performed at various UK venues such as London's Pizza on the Park, Ronnie Scott's the 606 Club in Chelsea and the Pizza Express in Soho. In the US he performed in hotels such as The Plaza and Algonquin hotels in New York as well at jazz festivals and concerts. He was the first Scottish male jazz singer to have been booked for the London Jazz Festival with his appearance at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. The venues range from intimate (aka tiny) jazz club settings to large- scale shows such as Jazz on a Summers Day, Britain’s largest jazz event with an audience of over 20,000 people.

The Cadmea, or Cadmeia (Greek: Καδμεία, Kadmía), was the citadel of ancient Thebes, Greece, which was named after Cadmus, the legendary founder of Thebes. The area is thought to have been settled since at least the early Bronze Age, although the history of settlement can only be reliably dated from the late Mycenaean period (c. 1400 BC).  Classical period  Map of the Topography of Ancient Thebes showing the location of the Cadmea Site of the Cadmea in 2016 In the classical and the early Hellenistic periods, the Cadmea served a similar purpose to the Acropolis of Athens; many public buildings were situated there, and the assemblies of Thebes and the Boeotian Confederacy are thought to have met there. During the Spartan (382–379/2 BC) and Macedonian occupations of Thebes, foreign garrisons were stationed on the Cadmea. Phoebidas was the general responsible for the unauthorized seizure of the citadel of Cadmea in 382 BC, in violation of the Peace of Antalcidas in place then.  Destruction and rebuilding  The Cadmea was destroyed in 335 BC by Alexander the Great, who razed the city of Thebes as a warning to other Greek cities contemplating revolt against his rule. Cassander, the Macedonian general who inherited the Greek territorial possessions of Alexander after his death, rebuilt the Cadmea in 316 BC.  Alternate meaning of cadmea  Cadmea is also an ancient name for calamine or zinc carbonate. Combined with copper, it was used in ancient times for the production of brass, as mentioned, for instance, by the Roman author, Pliny the Elder. The element, cadmium (Cd), was, in 1817, first isolated from an impurity in calamine; hence, the name, cadmium.

Widely called an \\"Imam\\" in the media, he himself denied being one. He was a co-author of the Akkari-Laban dossier, which played a major role in the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy by bringing the issue to the attention of influential decision-makers in the Middle East. In 2013 he distanced himself from his former position and in June 2020 became one of the founders of the political party New Centre-Left.Altinget.dk. Tidligere imam og Jyllands-Posten-kritiker er medstifter af nyt parti. (in Danish) Early years Ahmed Akkari was born in Lebanon in 1978. In 1985 the Akkaris family came to Denmark, where they obtained asylum, but returned to Lebanon in 1990. Upon their return to Denmark a year later they found they did not qualify as refugees again, because the Lebanese Civil War was over. With the support of some Danish local media, which featured young Ahmed as a model immigrant, they were granted a humanitarian residency permit in 1994. Ahmed Akkari subsequently went to high school and trained as a teacher in Århus. He became a Danish citizen in 2005 which made him eligible to be evacuated from Lebanon again in 2006.  Legal matters  In 2001 Ahmed Akkari was sentenced to 40 days in prison for beating an 11-year-old schoolboy on 3 November 2000 because the boy had allegedly been bullying Akkari's little sister. The sentence was suspended because Akkari was a first-time offender. Akkari, who was studying to be a teacher at the time, was present that day at Muslim private school Lykkeskolen in Aarhus where he was working as an apprentice teacher. According to sources at the school quoted in Ekstra-Bladet, his 11-year-old sister was playing with a boy from her class and the boy accidentally pulled her headscarf off. Akkari sought out the boy, pulled his ear drawing blood, and threw him to the ground kicking him several times. Cartoons controversy During the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy Akkari acted as a spokesman of the Danish-based European Committee for Prophet Honouring and spokesman of the Islamisk Trossamfund (Islamic Society in Denmark). =Controversial statements= In a documentary published by French television channel France 2 on 23 March 2006, Akkari was recorded - using a hidden camera - in conversation with Sheikh Raed Hlayhel (who was the head of the delegation to disseminate the \\"Akkari-Laban dossier\\"). Akkari made a statement which can be interpreted as an implicit death threat against Naser Khader, who is a moderate Muslim and, at the time, a member of the Danish parliament for the Social Liberal Party. According to the footage Akkari said: \\"...If Khader becomes minister of integration, shouldn't someone dispatch two guys to blow up him and his ministry?...\\". The comment was disputed. In the Arabic-French translation, Akkari calls for an attack on the ministry, but in two Arabic- Danish translations, Akkari merely states the possibility of such an attack. TV2's Arabic-Danish translation says \\"...If he (Khader) becomes minister of integration, isn't it possible that a couple (of people) would come to blow up him and his ministry?...\\". A fellow party member from Khader's party Elsebeth Gerner Nielsen reported Ahmed Akkari to the police. Ahmed Akkari initially denied the statements, but later apologized and stated it was meant as a joke. The following day, 24 March 2006, Islamisk Trossamfund announced that Ahmed Akkari was no longer spokesman for the organization; Akkari denied this. Apology In July 2013 Akkari distanced himself from the actions he took as an Imam in promoting fundamentalism. He stated that he had come to see the value of free speech, and apologized for his behavior during the Muhammad crisis.

Peraino got his nickname \\"Big Tony\\" allegedly due to his weight (over 300 pounds). Early family history Anthony and his brother Joseph are the sons of Prohibition era Mafia boss Giuseppe Piraino. The Peraino brothers' father was a member of the Sicilian Mafia and immigrated to the United States from Sicily around 1911 after escaping from the Palermo prison where he had been sentenced to 25 years. At some point the spelling of the Piraino family name was changed to its present spelling. Joe Piraino settled in New York around 1911, but it is unknown if he was already married upon his arrival. What is known is that Anthony was born approximately 4 years after his father's arrival from Sicily, and that his father immediately joined his fellow Sicilian countrymen in New York's Italian underworld and started to climb the ranks of the New York Mafia. By 1930, Piraino had become the boss of the Bay Ridge, Brooklyn area rackets, taking over bootlegging, gambling and extortion activities once controlled by boss Frankie Yale. Piraino was said to be an associate and ally of powerful New York Mafia boss Salvatore Maranzano, and on the night of March 27, 1931, Piraino attended a \\"bootleggers summit\\" in Brooklyn, where Maranzano was murdered as he left the meeting. Maranzano is suspected of being another casualty of the Castellammarese War, but his death could have been the result of separate Mafia conflict that was occurring within the Brooklyn bootlegging community. Author and Mafia historian Patrick Downey has theorized that Piraino may have in fact been the patriarch of the Profaci crime family, the precursor to the Colombo crime family, because Piraino's criminal interests, Brooklyn territory and several members of his group were absorbed into the group led by Brooklyn-based Mafia leader and Maranzano ally, Joseph Profaci, a theory that is supported by some, and dismissed by others. Another strong fact that lends to Downey's theory is that both of Piraino's sons--Anthony and Joseph--became members of the Profaci- Colombo crime family. Pornography family Tony Peraino was a \\"made man\\" member of the Profaci crime family most likely sometime before the books were closed for membership in the late 1950s, and like his father he climbed the ranks of the New York Mafia to become one of Colombo crime family's biggest earners. Peraino helped develop pornography into one of organized crime's biggest moneymakers after narcotics and labor racketeering. He was aided by his brother Joe \\"The Whale\\" Peraino, his sons Louis \\"Butchie\\" Peraino and Joseph C. Peraino, and his nephew, Joseph Peraino. Deep Throat The Peraino family financed and produced the most profitable pornographic film of all time -- Deep Throat, starring the first porn star ever, Linda Lovelace. Louis produced the movie and his father Anthony loaned him the initial $22,500 in production costs. The Perainos used a unique procedure known as four wall distribution in which they leased the theatres and collected all proceeds from each screening. To ensure compliance, they sent their own employees or associates known as \\"checkers\\" to run the movie houses. Anthony and Louis used profits from Deep Throat to build a vast financial empire in the 1970s that included, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), \\"ownership of garment companies in New York and Miami and investment companies\\".(Los Angeles Times, June 13, 1982 The Perainos controlled various adult and porn industry interests based in New York, Los Angeles and South Florida, from adult bookstores, to peep shows and adult movie theaters. Joseph Peraino later became involved in the distribution of another very successful pornographic film, The Devil in Miss Jones, and from his base of operations in California's San Fernando Valley, Peraino would maintain a tight grip on the Colombo crime family's interests in the porn industry well into the 1990s. Pornography bust Almost from the time of Deep Throat's release in 1972, prosecutors started going after the Peraino family. In 1975, Anthony and his brother Joseph were convicted for conspiracy to distribute Deep Throat. In 1976, Anthony was convicted on conspiracy to ship obscene material interstate. This conviction was for the distribution of Deep Throat on video tape. However, before he could be sentenced, he jumped bail and disappeared for the next five years, reportedly to Italy. In February 1979, as part of the MIPORN Operation, FBI agents raided adult movie theaters, warehouses, retail stores, and offices across the country. Anthony's two sons were arrested in the New York office of their company, Arrow Film and Video, and charged with interstate shipment of obscenity in the form of hardcore videos. Louis received six years in prison and Joseph C. received three years. In 1981, in poor health, Anthony turned himself in to authorities. In 1982 in Memphis, Tennessee, Anthony was sentenced to ten months in prison and $15,000 in fines for his 1976 conviction and for jumping bail. Decline of the Perainos With the Perainos under siege from law enforcement, a dispute between the Peraino brothers over their pornography and business empire was settled in favor of Anthony by the administration of the Colombo crime family. On January 4, 1982, gunmen chased down Anthony's brother Joseph and nephew Joseph Jr. in a residential area of Gravesend, Brooklyn and shot them. Joseph Jr. was killed, and Joseph Sr. was left paralyzed. In 1986, Anthony was reportedly involved in producing and distributing pornography out of Florida. He and Louis controlled an adult movie theater, the Gamecock, in Broward County, Florida. In September 1996, Anthony Peraino died in California of natural causes.

Playing career Gansey played for the Los Angeles Clippers on their 2007 NBA Vegas Summer League team. After the summer league was over, he signed a contract for the 2007–08 season with the Italian team Indesit Fabriano. He played college basketball as a shooting guard for the St. Bonaventure Bonnies and the West Virginia University Mountaineers. The , guard emerged as a national star for the Mountaineers during his tenure at WVU. Although it was speculated that he may get drafted as high as late first round in the 2006 NBA Draft, Gansey, along with his West Virginia teammate Kevin Pittsnogle, went undrafted. He signed as an undrafted free agent with the Miami Heat in July 2006, and played in summer league games, but was waived before the season. Mike was waived after having a life-threatening staph infection that limited his play. On September 24, 2008, Gansey was selected by the Erie Bayhawks with the first overall pick in the expansion draft.NBA Development League: 2008 Expansion Draft Board One of Gansey's brothers, Steve Gansey, played NCAA Division II basketball for the Ashland Eagles, after playing his freshman and sophomore years with the Division I Cleveland State Vikings. Early years Gansey, who grew up in the Cleveland, Ohio suburb of Olmsted Falls, was a three-time All-State player at Olmsted Falls High School, including first-team honors in his final two years. He is the school's all-time leading scorer at 1,909 points for his career. In his senior season, he averaged 27.2 points, 10.5 rebounds, 3.2 assists, and 3.3 steals per game, and was named the state's Division II Player of the Year, finishing second in Mr. Basketball voting behind LeBron James. He then began his college career at St. Bonaventure University. St. Bonaventure In Gansey's freshman season of 2001–02, he averaged 8.3 points and 4.7 rebounds, mainly coming off the bench, and was named to the all-newcomer team in the Atlantic 10 Conference. The following season (2002–03), he became a regular starter, averaging 13.9 points and 5.0 rebounds, and also shooting just over 40% from three-point range. However, the St. Bonaventure basketball program would be rocked by an academic scandal during that season, when it was revealed that a junior-college transfer had been admitted to the university by virtue of a welding certificate. With NCAA sanctions hanging over the program, several players, including Gansey, jumped ship immediately after that season.Gansey, signee Tathum leave Bonnies - Men's College Basketball - ESPN Once he announced his intention to transfer, he was pursued especially hard by WVU coach John Beilein,Gansey far removed from St. Bona fiasco - Men's College Basketball - ESPN who was coaching in the A-10 at Richmond during Gansey's freshman year at St. Bonaventure. Gansey would enroll at West Virginia University. West Virginia After sitting out the 2003–04 season as required under NCAA transfer rules, Gansey entered the Mountaineers' starting lineup. During the summer of 2004, the team toured Europe (all Division I teams are allowed one offseason overseas trip every four years); Gansey scored 22 points in his first game as a Mountaineer, against the Netherlands national team. He went on to lead the Mountaineers in scoring on the tour at 15.5 points per game. In his first season at WVU, he averaged 12.0 points and 5.1 rebounds, leading the team in rebounds and becoming a crowd favorite for his hustling play. During a strong late-season run, Gansey and teammate Kevin Pittsnogle were the main keys to turning the Mountaineers from an NCAA tournament \\"bubble team\\" to a regional finalist that lost its bid for the Final Four in overtime against Louisville. During the offseason, Gansey played on the gold medal- winning USA team at the World University Games in Turkey. The 2005–06 season promised to be a big season for the Mountaineers, who were returning four of their starting five and virtually all their roster. As the Mountaineers were reaching heights in the national rankings they had not seen since the early 1980s and gaining a level of national publicity they had last seen in the days of Jerry West in the late 1950s, Gansey stepped up his game to a new level. As of February 9, 2006, he was averaging 18.5 points while taking fewer than 12 shots per game, and adding 5.5 rebounds per game. More remarkably, Gansey was shooting 59.7% from the field, making him the only player in NCAA Division I under 6'5\\" (1.96 m) in the top 50 in the nation in field-goal percentage. WVU made the Sweet 16 of the 2006 NCAA Tournament before losing to the Texas Longhorns on a buzzer-beating 3 pointer. Gansey had the 18th highest career scoring average at WVU (14.35), the ninth best field goal percentage in a career (52.6%), the third best 3-point field goal percentage in a career (39.4%), the seventh most steals per game in a career (1.75) and the 12th most minutes per game in a career (32.12). Gansey was named First-team All Big-East as well as an AP Honorable Mention All-American.

The forest is found on in Crawford, Forest, and Warren Counties. The district also covers Erie and the northern part of Venango Counties. History Cornplanter State Forest was formed as a direct result of the depletion of the forests of Pennsylvania that took place during the mid-to-late 19th century. Conservationists like Dr. Joseph Rothrock became concerned that the forests would not regrow if they were not managed properly. Lumber and Iron companies had harvested the old-growth forests for various reasons. The clear cut the forests and left behind nothing but dried tree tops and rotting stumps. The sparks of passing steam locomotives ignited wildfires that prevented the formation of second growth forests. The conservationists feared that the forest would never regrow if there was not a change in the philosophy of forest management. They called for the state to purchase land from the lumber and iron companies and the lumber and iron companies were more than willing to sell their land since that had depleted the natural resources of the forests. The changes began to take place in 1895 when Dr. Rothrock was appointed the first commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, the forerunner of today's Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a piece of legislation in 1897 that authorized the purchase of \\"unseated lands for forest reservations.\\" This was the beginning of the State Forest system.

Elk from the Rocky Mountains were reintroduced to the area between 1913 and 1926 and the herd today has over 600 animals. This is up from a low of just 35 elk counted in the 1970s. Their range is mostly in southeastern Elk and southwestern Cameron counties. The Pennsylvania Game Commission is responsible for maintaining the elk herd in Elk State Forest and the surrounding area. In an effort to keep the herds away from agricultural areas the game commission maintains the forest in a way that suits the feeding needs of the elk. Scattered tracts of trees in the forest have been sold to lumber companies. The forest that grows in place of the harvested timber provides a variety of browse that is needed by the elk. The game commission also maintains sections of grassy areas in various locations throughout Elk State Forest providing further variety in feed for the elk. Visitors to Elk State Forest may chance upon an elk especially during the mating season which occurs in September and October. All visitors are encouraged to keep a safe distance from any elk, but especially the bull elk who can be very dangerous during the rutting season. History The history of Elk State Forest is very similar to that of the other state forests in Pennsylvania. The land was primarily acquired from lumber companies during the early 20th century. Vast stands of old-growth forest had been harvested by the lumber companies during the mid-to-late 19th century. The earliest lumbering operations harvested the largest of the white pines for use in the shipbuilding industry. The tall and straight timbers were ideally suited for use as ships masts and spars. The logs were lashed together with rope and floated down the tributaries of the West Branch Susquehanna River and into the river on their way to the shipyards of Baltimore. Once the white pines were gone the lumbermen turned to the hemlock for use as lumber. Sawmills and lumber camps sprang up throughout what is now Elk State Forest. Much of the timber was floated down Driftwood Branch, First Fork and Bennett's Branch to the West Branch Susquehanna River and into the Susquehanna Boom near Williamsport. The lumber era in the area of Elk State Forest lasted until 1915 when the last raft was floated down the Driftwood Branch. The departure of the lumber companies left a forest that was described as a vast wasteland of tree stumps and dried treetops. Sparks cast off by passing steam trains ignited wildfires that slowed the growth of the thriving second growth forest of hardwoods that is now Elk State Forest. The formation of the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression by President Franklin D. Roosevelt was key to the revitalization of the forests of Elk State Forest. The young men of the CCC cleared the forest and streams of the dried underbrush that was the fuel for the devastating wildfires. Nine CCC camps spread throughout the forest worked to build roads, trail and bridges throughout Elk State Forest. They also fought the periodic wildfires. On October 19, 1938, during a wildfire near Pepperhill to the north of Sinnamanhoning, eight young men from the CCC lost their lives when they were trapped on a steep hillside while fighting the raging fire. The Wayside Memorial Spring south of Emporium on Pennsylvania Route 120 in Bucktail State Park Natural Area is maintained as an honor to the men who lost their lives battling forest fires for the CCC.

The main offices are located in Laughlintown in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania in the United States. Mount Davis, the highest peak in Pennsylvania, is located in the forest. The forest was named in honor of General John Forbes. It includes 20 separate tracts of land and covers over that stretch across Fayette, Somerset, and Westmoreland Counties. The designated forest tracts generally follow one of the area's dominant terrain features, Laurel Ridge, part of the Laurel Highlands. History Forbes State Forest was formed as a direct result of the depletion of the forests of Pennsylvania that took place during the mid-to-late 19th century. Conservationists like Dr. Joseph Rothrock became concerned that the forests would not regrow if they were not managed properly. Lumber and iron companies had harvested the old-growth forests for various reasons. They clear cut the forests and left behind nothing but dried tree tops and rotting stumps. The sparks of passing steam locomotives of the Pittsburgh, Westmoreland and Somerset Railroad ignited wildfires that prevented the formation of second growth forests. The conservationists feared that the forest would never regrow if there was not a change in the philosophy of forest management. They called for the state to purchase land from the lumber and iron companies and the lumber and iron companies were more than willing to sell their land since that had depleted the natural resources of the forests. The changes began to take place in 1895 when Dr. Rothrock was appointed the first commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, the forerunner of today's Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a piece of legislation in 1897 that authorized the purchase of \\"unseated lands for forest reservations.\\" This was the beginning of the State Forest system. Cole Run Falls is located in an isolated unit of the reserve. Facilities The Spruce Flat Bog is reached via a short trail from adjacent Laurel Summit State Park. In order to accommodate visitors, the state has allowed the development of 9 areas within Forbes. This includes 6 State Parks and 3 State Forest Picnic Areas. The remainder of the area is undeveloped except for hiking trails maintained by the state. These are generally closed to vehicles but open to hiking, cross- country skiing, hunting, and fishing. Several portions of what is now designated as part of the Forbes State Forest had previously been either developed or commercially exploited through logging through the early-to- mid-20th century. These areas have been allowed, and sometimes encouraged, to return to their natural state.

It also includes a number of important natural features and points of interest: =Roaring Run Natural Area= This tract of was acquired by the State of Pennsylvania in 1975. After previous development and logging, this portion of the west slope of Laurel Ridge is currently undergoing reforestation. It is compromised largely of second and third growth mixed mesophytic forest. Roaring Run feeds into Indian Creek, which is a tributary of the Youghiogheny River. =Mt. Davis Natural Area= Mt. Davis is the highest point in Pennsylvania. The area eventually drains into the Casselman River, a part of the Mississippi River watershed (via the Youghiogheny, Monongahela, and Ohio Rivers). One of the natural attractions of the area is the presence of small concentric stone rings which result from frost heaving in small patches of earth which are softer than the ground surrounding them. Frost causing the patches to be pushed up higher than their surroundings is followed by the effects of natural erosion which results in stones sliding to the bottom of the protrusion and forming ring-like patterns at the base. =Spruce Flats Wildlife Management Area= Spruce Flats Bog, which was formed in 1908 after the area was deforested and a subsequent fire altered the composition of the soil. This Wildlife Management Area covers , with a focal point on the of the Spruce Flats Bog which formed in a natural depression atop Laurel Ridge. The area had previously passed through the successional sequence from open water to (eventually) forest. This process was actually reversed in the early part of the 20th century by a combination of clear-cutting the forest, and fires which burned away much of the forest floor. This resulted in a return to the swamp or bog stage of development, and the area is now slowly proceeding back into the forest stage. The bog currently hosts a large community of cranberry, pitcher plant, sundew, and cotton grass.

The original purchase of was purchased in 1919 at the end of the lumber era that swept throughout the mountains of Pennsylvania. The state continued to purchase land throughout the 20th century with the last acquisition taking place in 1980. Most of the land was acquired from large scale lumbering corporations. These lumber businesses stripped the old growth forest that once spread over most of Pennsylvania. They began lumbering on a large scale in 1883 when the first sawmills were constructed in the area along the many creeks that drained the Allegheny Plateau. The lumbermen harvested the hemlock and white pine trees on an almost exclusive basis. The logs of hemlock and pine were lashed together in rafts and floated down the Clarion River and into the Allegheny River to Pittsburgh. The lumber companies also built three logging railroads in the area to get the lumber out of the mountains and on to the cities of Western Pennsylvania. The lumbering operations left behind what has been described as a \\"barren wasteland\\" of stumps and dried treetops. The sparks cast off by passing steam trains set off massive forest fires. These fires slowed the development of the second growth forest that now covers Clear Creek State Forest. The forests have largely regrown with the hemlock and white pine trees being replaced with thriving populations of various hardwood trees.

It is intended to allow programs written in different programming languages to easily share information. As used in programming languages, a type can be described as a definition of a set of values (for example, \\"all integers between 0 and 10\\"), and the allowable operations on those values (for example, addition and subtraction). The specification for the CTS is contained in Ecma standard 335, \\"Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) Partitions I to VI.\\" The CLI and the CTS were created by Microsoft, and the Microsoft .NET framework is an implementation of the standard.

Since version 2, \\"Symmetric Arithmetic Rounding\\" (round halves away from zero) is also available by programmer's option. *it is used to communicate with other languages Type categories  The common type system supports two general categories of types: ;Value types : Value types directly contain their data, and instances of value types are either allocated on the stack or allocated inline in a structure. Value types can be built-in (implemented by the runtime), user-defined, or enumerations. ;Reference types : Reference types store a reference to the value's memory address, and are allocated on the heap. Reference types can be self-describing types, pointer types, or interface types. The type of a reference type can be determined from values of self-describing types. Self-describing types are further split into arrays and class types. The class types are user-defined classes, boxed value types, and delegates. The following example written in Visual Basic .NET shows the difference between reference types and value types: Imports System Class Class1 Public Value As Integer = 0 End Class 'Class1 Class Test Shared Sub Main() Dim val1 As Integer = 0 Dim val2 As Integer = val1 'Coded By val2 = 123 Dim ref1 As New Class1() Dim ref2 As Class1 = ref1 ref2.Value = 123 Console.WriteLine(\\"Values: {0}, {1}\\", val1, val2) Console.WriteLine(\\"Refs: {0}, {1}\\", ref1.Value, ref2.Value) End Sub 'Main End Class 'Test The output of the above example Values: 0, 123 Refs: 123, 123 =Boxing and unboxing= =Boxing= Converting value types to reference types is also known as boxing.

The horses were placed on the facade, on the loggia above the porch, of St Mark's Basilica in Venice, northern Italy after the sack of Constantinople in 1204. They remained there until looted by Napoleon in 1797 but were returned in 1815. The sculptures have been removed from the facade and placed in the interior of St Mark's for conservation purposes, with replicas in their position on the loggia. Origins The sculptures date from classical antiquity and have been implausibly attributed to the 4th century BC Greek sculptor Lysippos. A date in the 2nd or 3rd century AD is considered far more likely; the famous Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius in Rome (c. 175 AD) provides a point of comparison.Henig, Martin (ed), A Handbook of Roman Art, p. 95, Phaidon, 1983, However, some scholars do claim the naturalistic rendering of the animals and technical expertise in execution point to a Classical Greek origin. They were probably created to top a triumphal arch or some other grand building, perhaps commissioned by the Emperor Septimus Severus. They may originally have been made for the Eastern capital of Constantinople, and certainly reached there later. Although called bronze, analysis suggests that, as they are at least 96.67% copper,Anon 1979 The Horses of San Marco Thames and Hudson an English translation of a 1977 Venetian city government publication, p. 191 they should be seen as an impure copper rather than bronze. The relatively low tin content increased the casting temperature to 1200–1300 °C.Anon 1979, p. 199 The high purity copper was chosen to give a more satisfactory mercury gilding. History It is certain that the horses, along with the quadriga with which they were depicted, were long displayed at the Hippodrome of Constantinople; they may be the \\"four gilt horses that stand above the Hippodrome\\" that \\"came from the island of Chios under Theodosius II\\" mentioned in the 8th- or early 9th-century Parastaseis syntomoi chronikai.Parastaseis syntomoi chronikai, ch. 84.Th They were still there in 1204, when they were looted by Venetian forces as part of the sack of the capital of the Byzantine Empire in the Fourth Crusade. The collars on the four horses were added in 1204 to obscure where the animals' heads had been severed to allow them to be transported from Constantinople to Venice. Shortly after the Fourth Crusade, Doge Enrico Dandolo sent the horses to Venice, where they were installed on the terrace of the façade of St Mark's Basilica in 1254. Petrarch admired them there.Petrarch, Rerum senilium, V., noted by Roberto Weiss, The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity (Oxford: Blackwell) 1973:35. In 1797, Napoleon had the horses forcibly removed from the basilica and carried off to Paris, where they were used in the design of the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel together with a quadriga. In 1815 the horses were returned to Venice by Captain Dumaresq. He had fought at the Battle of Waterloo and was with the allied forces in Paris where he was selected, by the Emperor of Austria, to take the horses down from the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel and return them to St Mark's in Venice. For the skillful manner in which he performed this work the Emperor gave him a gold snuff box with his initials in diamonds on the lid.A History of The Boissier-Scobell Families\\" by Henry Boissier, 1933 page 7. Conservation-restoration of the Horses of Saint Mark The horses remained in place over St Mark's until the early 1980s, when the ongoing damage from growing air pollution forced their replacement with exact copies.

At his peak he performed about 125 concerts per year. He was also very active as a recording artist. By 1940, he was in Hollywood, leading the brass section of M-G-M's studio orchestra. He contributed to the films Flying Down to Rio and Hondo, among others. Méndez was legendary for his tone, range, technique and unparalleled double tonguing. His playing was characterized by a brilliant tone, wide vibrato and clean, rapid articulation. His repertoire was a mixture of classical, popular, jazz, and Mexican folk music. He contributed many arrangements and original compositions to the trumpet repertoire. His Scherzo in D minor is often heard in recitals, and has been recorded by David Hickman. He is regarded as popularizing \\"La Virgen de la Macarena\\", commonly known as \\"the bullfighter's song\\", to US audiences. Perhaps his most significant if not famous single recording, \\"Moto Perpetuo\\", was written in the eighteenth century by Niccolò Paganini for violin and features Mendez double-tonguing continuously for over 4 minutes while circular breathing to give the illusion that he is not taking a natural breath while playing. Personal life Rafael Méndez married Amor Rodriguez after meeting her in Detroit. They had twin sons, both now surgeons; Dr. Rafael G. Méndez, Jr. and Dr. Robert Méndez, and five grandchildren. Rafael Méndez suffered from serious asthma-related problems by the late 1950s which caused increasing difficulty performing at his level of performance. After an injury at a baseball game in Mexico in 1967 caused additional deterioration, he retired from performing in 1975, but continued to compose and arrange. He died at his home in Encino, California on September 15, 1981. Honors, awards and legacy Arizona State University's music building houses the Rafael Méndez Library which was dedicated and opened on June 11, 1993. The library holds 300 manuscripts and almost 700 compositions and arrangements by Méndez, as well as hundreds of images, articles and recordings. It also has an online counterpart. In 2006, the Los Angeles Opera paid tribute to Rafael Mendez by performing a work based on his life. A reviewer in The Los Angeles Times believed that Mendez \\"has been called the greatest trumpet player of all time.\\" Discography *Concerto for Méndez *Love and Inspiration *Magnificent Méndez *Méndez in Madrid *Méndez Plays Arban' *Rafael Méndez & Laurindo Almeida Together *Rafael Méndez (unplayed 4 disc set) *Rafael Méndez and His Orchestra' *The Magic Trumpet of Rafael Méndez *The Majestic Sound of Rafael Méndez *The Singing Trumpet *The Trumpet Virtuosity of Rafael Méndez *Trumpet Extraordinary (1957) *Trumpet Showcase *Trumpet Solos Extraordinary *Trumpet Spectacular References External links *Rafael Méndez Online Library at Arizona State University with free mp3 sound clips   1906 births 1981 deaths Mexican artists Mexican composers Mexican male composers Mexican music arrangers People from Jiquilpan, Michoacán Musicians from Michoacán Mexican trumpeters Burials at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills) 20th- century composers 20th-century trumpeters 20th-century male musicians Decca Records artists ","title":"Rafael Méndez"},{"id":"4011589","title":"Nailea Norvind"},{"id":"4011609","title":"List of female United States presidential and vice-presidential candidates"},{"id":"4011614","text":"Lotta's fountain is a fountain at the intersection of Market Street, where Geary and Kearny Streets connect in downtown San Francisco, California. It was commissioned by actress Lotta Crabtree in 1875 as a gift to the city of San Francisco, and would serve as a significant meeting point in the aftermath of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. History Palace Hotel is at right and the Ferry Building's clock tower is in the distance The cast-iron fountain, commissioned by actress Lotta Crabtree as a gift to the city, was dedicated September 9, 1875. During its centennial it was designated both a San Francisco Designated Landmarks and the U.S National Historic Places. A plaque commemorates its role as a meeting point in the aftermath of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. Another plaque mentions the opera soprano Luisa Tetrazzini, who gave a memorable performance for the people of San Francisco at the fountain on Christmas Eve, 1910, after legal difficulties prevented her from appearing on stage. The bronze column was added in 1916 to match the height of new lights being installed along Market Street. In 1974 it was relocated from its original location at 3rd, Market and Kearny during the renovation of Market Street. In 1999 the fountain was refurbished to its 1875 appearance, repainted a metallic gold-brown. Its lion's-head spigots flow during daytime hours. In 1919, a commemoration of the earthquake was started that still occurs annually. The South of Market Boys, a fraternal drinking organization, hung a wreath on the fountain. Since then, survivors of the earthquake gathered at 5:12 a.m. on April 18 at the intersection. After the 2015 anniversary, the last two survivors of the earthquake died. In 2016, more than 200 participants, many in period costuming, gathered to commemorate victims of the earthquake and to draw attention to earthquake preparedness.http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Last-known-survivor- of-1906-S-F-earthquake-dies-6751833.phphttps://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo- way/2016/01/12/462771935/last-known-survivor-of-1906-san-francisco-earthquake- has-died See also * List of San Francisco Designated Landmarks References Sources *O'Brien, Robert This is San Francisco Chronicle Books 1994, reprint from 1948 External links *Lotta Crabtree *Lotta Crabtree, Fairy Star of the Gold Rush *\\"Lotta's Legacy,\\" by J.

History Following the cognitive revolution, cognitive linguists, computer scientists, and cognitive psychologists have borrowed terms from rhetorical and literary criticism. Specifically, metaphor is a fundamental concept throughout cognitive science, particularly for cognitive linguistic models in which meaning-making is dependent on metaphor production and comprehension. Computer scientists and philosophers of mind draw on literary studies for terms like “scripts”, “stories”, “stream of consciousness”, “multiple drafts”, and “Joycean machine”. Cognitive psychologists have researched literary and rhetorical topics such as “reader response” and “deixis” in narrative fiction, and transmission of poetry in oral traditions. Composition Rhetoric is a term often used in reference to composition studies and pedagogy, a tradition that dates back to Ancient Greece. The emergence of Rhetoric as a teachable craft (techne) links rhetoric and composition pedagogy, notably in the tradition of Sophism. Aristotle collected Sophist handbooks on rhetoric and critiqued them in Synagoge Techne (fourth century BCE). In Ancient Rome, the Greek Rhetorical tradition was absorbed and became vital to education, as rhetoric was valued in a highly political society with an advanced system of law, where speaking well was crucial to winning favor, alliances, and legal rulings. Cognitive Rhetoricians focusing on composition (such as Linda Flower and John Hayes) draw from the paradigm, methods, and terms of cognitive science to build a pedagogy of composition, where writing is an instance of everyday problem- solving processes. James A. Berlin has argued that by focusing on professional composition and communications and ignoring ideology, social-cognitive rhetoric—which maps structures of the mind onto structures of language and the interpersonal world—lends itself to use as a tool for training workers in corporate capitalism. Berlin contrasts Social-Cognitive Rhetoric with Social- Epistemic Rhetoric, which makes ideology the core issue of composition pedagogy. Language and literary studies Cognitive Rhetoric offers a new way of looking at properties of literature from the perspective of cognitive science. It is interdisciplinary in character and committed to data and methods that produce falsifiable theory. Rhetoric also offers a store of stylistic devices observed for their effect on audiences, providing a rich index with distinguished examples available to researchers in cognitive neuropsychology and cognitive science. For Mark Turner (a prominent figure in Cognitive Rhetoric), narrative imaging is the fundamental instrument of everyday thought. Individuals organize experience in a constant narrative flow, starting with small spatial stories. Meaning is fundamentally parabolic (like a parable): two or more event shapes or conceptual spaces converge (blending) in the parabolic process, generating concepts with unique properties not found in either of the inputs. This process is everyday: anticipating that an object you are headed toward will make contact with you is a parable whereby you project a spatial viewpoint. Such narrative flow is a highly adaptive process, crucial for planning, evaluating, explaining, as well as recalling the past and imagining a future. Thus, literary processes have adaptive value prior to the emergence of linguistic capability (modular or continuous).

It is a semi-metal related to the II-VI group of semiconductor materials. Alternative names are mercuric telluride and mercury(II) telluride. HgTe occurs in nature as the mineral form coloradoite. Properties All properties are at standard temperature and pressure unless stated otherwise. The lattice parameter is about 0.646 nm in the cubic crystalline form. The bulk modulus is about 42.1 GPa. The thermal expansion coefficient is about 5.2×10−6/K. Static dielectric constant 20.8, dynamic dielectric constant 15.1. Thermal conductivity is low at 2.7 W·m2/(m·K). HgTe bonds are weak leading to low hardness values. Hardness 2.7×107 kg/m2. =Doping= N-type doping can be achieved with elements such as boron, aluminium, gallium, or indium. Iodine and iron will also dope n-type. HgTe is naturally p-type due to mercury vacancies. P-type doping is also achieved by introducing zinc, copper, silver, or gold. Chemistry  HgTe bonds are weak. Their enthalpy of formation, around −32kJ/mol, is less than a third of the value for the related compound cadmium telluride. HgTe is easily etched by acids, such as hydrobromic acid. Growth Bulk growth is from a mercury and tellurium melt in the presence of a high mercury vapour pressure. HgTe can also be grown epitaxially, for example, by sputtering or by metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy. Unique physical properties Electron micrograph (right) of a HgTe nanowire embedded in a carbon nanotube, combined with an image simulation (left). Recently it was shown both theoretically and experimentally, that mercury-telluride quantum well shows a unique new state of matter—the \\"topological insulator\\". In this phase, while the bulk is an insulator, current can be carried by electronic states confined close to the sample edges. Unlike the quantum hall effect, here no magnetic field is required to create this unique behavior. In addition, oppositely directed edge states carry opposite spin projections. =Related compounds= * Cadmium telluride * HgSe * HgCdTe References External links * Thermophysical properties database at Germany's Chemistry Information Centre, Berlin Mercury(II) compounds Tellurides II-VI semiconductors ","title":"Mercury telluride"},{"id":"4011700","text":"Kjeld Stub Irgens (23 May 1879 - 26 August 1963) was a Norwegian politician during the German occupation of Norway. Early life He was born in 1879 to vicar Jens Stub Irgens and his wife Sophie Cathinka, née Altschwager. He had several brothers and sisters.Genealogy (vestraat.net) He was a distant relative of eighteenth-century bishop Ole Irgens and politicians Ole and Johannes Irgens.Das Geschlecht der Irgens, by Einar Irgens Loe Seafaring career A sea captain by profession, Irgens had received his education in the Royal Norwegian Navy, which he left with the rank of First Lieutenant () in 1903. From 1913 onwards Irgens worked for the Norwegian America Line (NAL) shipping company, in 1918 assuming command of the NAL's 12,977 GRT passenger ship SS Stavangerfjord. In 1921 Irgens purchased the island of Ravnøy in Vestfold on behalf of the crew of Stavangerfjord, as a holiday resort at which to spend time with their families after spending long periods of time at sea. The 270-decare property, located between the island of Nøtterøy and Stokke on the mainland, was bought at a price of 10,000 Norwegian kroner and later transferred to the Norwegian America Line. The shipping company remained in ownership of the island until 1983 when it was sold on to the Holiday Resort Ravnøy Foundation (). World War II Irgens in 1939. =Negotiations during the German invasion= He was not involved with the Norwegian Nazi party, Nasjonal Samling, before the Second World War reached Norway in 1940. However, he was married to a sister of Albert Viljam Hagelin, a leading member of Nasjonal Samling, and one day after the German invasion he was summoned by Hagelin and Vidkun Quisling to Hagelin's suite at the Hotel Continental in Oslo.Bjørnsen 1977: 153 Here, he was asked to persuade King Haakon VII to abdicate and to name Quisling as Prime Minister. Together with Curt Bräuer he traveled to Elverum to negotiate, but his efforts proved fruitless. On his way to Elverum Irgens encountered some members of the Storting at Hamar Station, stating his intention to meet with the King.Bjørnsen 1977, p. 288 Irgens arrived at Elverum late in the evening of 10 April, being allowed to sleep in Minister Hjelmtveit's bed for a few hours before seeing the King the next morning. The meeting led nowhere, as the final Norwegian decision to resist the invasion had already been taken the previous day.Bjørnsen 1977, p. 290 The Norwegian government refused Quisling's demands and vowed to resist the German invasion as long as possible. =Collaborationist minister= When Reichskommissar Josef Terboven formed a cabinet on 25 September 1940, Irgens accepted the position as provisional Minister of Shipping. The Ministry of Shipping was a government ministry established specifically for Irgens on the insistence of Terboven, as Irgens was considered close to Haakon VII. Because of Irgens' relations with the exiled Norwegian king Terboven strongly wished to include him in his administration. At the same time he enrolled as a party member of Nasjonal Samling. From the beginning of Irgens' work at the Ministry of Shipping he successfully defended the part of the Norwegian merchant fleet left in the occupied country against German attempts at taking the ships as prizes. As of September 1941 his position was no longer provisional.Ministries 1940 - 1945\\\\. Under German occupation in Oslo -- Government.no On 1 February 1942 Quisling was allowed by the occupants to form his own cabinet; Irgens continued as Minister of Shipping. He was removed on 12 June 1944 together with Eivind Blehr for emphasizing Norwegian nationalism rather than Pan- Germanic national socialism. Irgens had also come under criticism for hesitating to accept members of Nasjonal Samling joining his ministry. At the same time the Ministry of Shipping ceased to exist. Post-World War II As part of the legal purge in Norway after the war, in 1945, Irgens was sentenced to seven years of forced labour. The case was taken to the Supreme Court in 1946, where the sentence was increased to fifteen years. He died in 1963.

Biography =Early years= Molesworth was born in Millbrook, Hampshire and was the son of John Edward Nassau Molesworth, Vicar of Rochdale who was a great grandson of Robert Molesworth, 1st Viscount Molesworth. Sir Guildford's great niece was Margaret Patricia Molesworth (1904–1985), the grandmother of Sophie, Countess of Wessex.Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, volume 2, 2003. pages 2721–2731. Molesworth was educated at the College for Civil Engineers at Putney, apprenticed under Mr Dockray in the London and North Western Railway, and under Sir William Fairbairn at Manchester. Career He became a chief assistant engineer of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, but soon resigned to conduct the constructions at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, during the Crimean War. He received the Watt Medal and the Manby premium in 1858 from the Institution of Civil Engineers for his paper on Conversion of Wood by Machinery. He returned to London for a number of years, worked at his profession, then went to Ceylon in 1859 and in 1862 became chief engineer of the government railways in Ceylon. From 1871 to 1889 he was consulting engineer to the Indian government with regard to State railways. He received medals from the British Government for his services during the Afghan War and the Burma War, and was president of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1904.  Gauge  Molesworth was consulted on a number of occasions on the suitability of adopting a narrow gauge rather than a broad one. He was generally against the narrow gauge as he regarded the cost savings as illusory. His broad gauge line to Kandy is proof that this gauge is practicable in steep mountains.  Bibliography  He published the Molesworth's Pocket Book of Engineering Formulae. This useful little volume contained formulas and details on many engineering related subjects. The first edition was published in November 1862 and ran to over thirty editions (The twenty-eighth editionwas published in 1921).

He held several important positions, such as Norwegian Minister of Finance and Customs from 1934 to 1935 and in 1945, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 1941 to 1966 and Governor of the Central Bank of Norway from 1946 to 1954. Life and work He was born in Trondheim, the son of director Christian Fredy Michael Jahn (1837–1914) and Elisabeth Wilhelmine Wexelsen (1853–1930). He was a grandson of Vilhelm Andreas Wexelsen, a grandnephew of Marie Wexelsen and a first cousin of Per Kvist. He finished his secondary education at Trondheim Cathedral School in 1902 graduated from the Royal Frederick University with the cand.jur. degree in 1907. He worked as a deputy judge in Lofoten before enrolling at the university again; he graduated in economics in 1909. He was hired in Statistics Norway in 1910. In April 1911 he married Martha Larsen Jahn. From 1913 he was a teacher at Kristiania Commerce School and the university, jobs he left in 1918 and 1920 respectively. From 1917 to 1919 he worked in Rasjoneringsdirektoratet, and from 1919 to 1920 he was the director there. In 1920 he became director of Statistics Norway. He was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 1927. From November 1934 to March 1935 he was the Minister of Finance and Customs in Mowinckel's Third Cabinet. He became a member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee in 1937, and chairman from 1941 to 1966. In 1940 he was a member of the Administrative Council, which tried to maintain Norwegian political governance despite the German invasion and occupation of Norway. He marked himself as a strong proponent of resistance to Germany, and was a member of the central leadership of the resistance: \\"Kretsen\\" and Hjemmefrontens Ledelse. He was arrested by the Nazi authorities on 25 October 1944, and incarcerated at Akershus Fortress until 8 December. He was then sent to Grini concentration camp, where he sat until the liberation of Norway. After the German surrender, he saw himself as a candidate to become Prime Minister of Norway, but Hjemmefrontens Ledelse chose Paal Berg as their candidate. He instead became Minister of Finance and Customs of the Norwegian interim government, Gerhardsen's First Cabinet, on 25 June. He remained so until 4 November the same year, and also served on the Board of Governors in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund in 1945. He then headed the Central Bank of Norway from 1946 to 1954. He presided over the International Statistical Institute from 1947 to 1951, and was an honorary member. As the Chairman of the Nobel Committee, he delivered the Presentation Speech to The Nobel Peace Prize 1947 to the Quaker Friends Service Council (British) and American Friends Service Committee (http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1947/press.html).

It is calculated from the precision and recall of the test, where the precision is the number of correctly identified positive results divided by the number of all positive results, including those not identified correctly, and the recall is the number of correctly identified positive results divided by the number of all samples that should have been identified as positive. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall. The more generic F_\\\\beta score applies additional weights and values one of precision and recall more than the other. The highest possible value of an F-score is 1, indicating perfect precision and recall, and the lowest possible value is 0, if either the precision or the recall is zero. The F1 score is also known as the Sørensen–Dice coefficient or Dice similarity coefficient (DSC).  Etymology  The name F-measure is believed to be named after a different F function in Van Rijsbergen's book, when introduced to the Fourth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-4, 1992).  Definition  The traditional F-measure or balanced F-score (F1 score) is the harmonic mean of precision and recall: :F_1 = \\\\frac{2}{\\\\mathrm{recall}^{-1} + \\\\mathrm{precision}^{-1}} = 2 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{precision} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{recall}}{\\\\mathrm{precision} + \\\\mathrm{recall}} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{tp}}{\\\\mathrm{tp} + \\\\frac12 (\\\\mathrm{fp} + \\\\mathrm{fn}) } . =F_\\\\beta= A more general F score, F_\\\\beta, that uses a positive real factor β, where β is chosen such that recall is considered β times as important as precision, is: :F_\\\\beta = (1 + \\\\beta^2) \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{precision} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{recall}}{(\\\\beta^2 \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{precision}) + \\\\mathrm{recall}}. In terms of Type I and type II errors this becomes: :F_\\\\beta = \\\\frac {(1 + \\\\beta^2) \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{true\\\\ positive} }{(1 + \\\\beta^2) \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{true\\\\ positive} + \\\\beta^2 \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{false\\\\ negative} + \\\\mathrm{false\\\\ positive}}\\\\,. Two commonly used values for β are 2, which weighs recall higher than precision, and 0.5, which weighs recall lower than precision. The F-measure was derived so that F_\\\\beta \\"measures the effectiveness of retrieval with respect to a user who attaches β times as much importance to recall as precision\\". It is based on Van Rijsbergen's effectiveness measure :E = 1 - \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{p} + \\\\frac{1-\\\\alpha}{r}\\\\right)^{-1}. Their relationship is F_\\\\beta = 1 - E where \\\\alpha=\\\\frac{1}{1 + \\\\beta^2}.  Diagnostic testing  This is related to the field of binary classification where recall is often termed \\"sensitivity\\".  Applications  The F-score is often used in the field of information retrieval for measuring search, document classification, and query classification performance. Earlier works focused primarily on the F1 score, but with the proliferation of large scale search engines, performance goals changed to place more emphasis on either precision or recall and so F_\\\\beta is seen in wide application. The F-score is also used in machine learning.See, e.g., the evaluation of the . However, the F-measures do not take true negatives into account, hence measures such as the Matthews correlation coefficient, Informedness or Cohen's kappa may be preferred to assess the performance of a binary classifier. The F-score has been widely used in the natural language processing literature, such as in the evaluation of named entity recognition and word segmentation.  Criticism  David Hand and others criticize the widespread use of the F1 score since it gives equal importance to precision and recall. In practice, different types of mis- classifications incur different costs. In other words, the relative importance of precision and recall is an aspect of the problem. According to Davide Chicco and Giuseppe Jurman, the F1 score is less truthful and informative than the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) in binary evaluation classification. David Powers has pointed out that F1 ignores the True Negatives and thus is misleading for unbalanced classes, while kappa and correlation measures are symmetric and assess both directions of predictability - the classifier predicting the true class and the true class predicting the classifier prediction, proposing separate multiclass measures Informedness and Markedness for the two directions, noting that their geometric mean is correlation. Difference from Fowlkes–Mallows index While the F-measure is the harmonic mean of recall and precision, the Fowlkes–Mallows index is their geometric mean. Extension to multi-class classification The F-score is also used for evaluating classification problems with more than two classes (Multiclass classification). In this setup, the final score is obtained by micro-averaging (biased by class frequency) or macro-averaging (taking all classes as equally important). For macro-averaging, two different formulas have been used by applicants: the F-score of (arithmetic) class-wise precision and recall means or the arithmetic mean of class-wise F-scores, where the latter exhibits more desirable properties.

It is widely considered to be the first identifiable Slavic archaeological culture. It was contemporaneous to (and located mostly just to the north of) the Chernyakhov culture. Settlements are found mostly along river banks, frequently either on high cliffs or right by the edge of rivers. The dwellings are overwhelmingly of the semi-subterranean type (common among earlier Celtic and Germanic and later among Slavic cultures), often square (about four by four meters), with an open hearth in a corner. Most villages consist of just a handful of dwellings. There is very little evidence of the division of labor, although in one case a village belonging to the Kiev culture was preparing thin strips of antlers to be further reworked into the well-known Gothic antler combs, in a nearby Chernyakhov culture village.

Biography Thomson was born at Glororum, Northumberland, England, the third child of Alexander Thomson and his wife, Janet, née Turnbull. After his father was killed in a hunting accident in 1830, the young Thomson and his mother went to live in Abbey St. Bathans, Berwickshire. He was educated at Wooler and Duns Academy, later spending some time attached to Marischal College, Aberdeen, and Edinburgh University before studying engineering at Peter Nicholson's School of Engineering at Newcastle-on-Tyne. Thomson arrived in the Malay Straits in 1838 and was employed by the East India Survey. In 1841 he was appointed Government Surveyor at Singapore and in 1844 became Superintendent of Roads and Public Works. He was responsible for the design and construction of a number of notable engineering works including bridges, roads, and hospitals. He conducted the allotment survey of Singapore, the topographical survey of the island of Singapore and its dependencies, and the marine survey of the Straits of Singapore and the east coasts of Johore and Penang. His outstanding achievement was the erection of the Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca. Thomson memorial in Ranfurly, New ZealandIn 1853 his health failed and he returned to England where he studied modern engineering techniques, and travelled widely through Britain and the Continent inspecting engineering works. Early in 1856 he emigrated to New Zealand, where he worked as Chief Surveyor of the Otago Province until 1873. From 1876 until 1879 he was Surveyor-General of New Zealand. He was also the original surveyor of the city of Invercargill. From 1856 until 1858 Thomson surveyed and explored large sections of the interior of the South Island, covering most of the southern half of the island. Many names in the area bear witness to Thomson's Northumbrian background, though there is a widespread belief that the naming of many places was through a disagreement with the New Zealand surveying authorities. It has long been suggested that Thomson originally intended to give traditional Maori names to many places, but these names were refused. In response, Thomson gave prosaic Northumbrian names to many places, often simply in the form of a Northumbrian dialectic name for an animal. The Maniototo region around the town of Ranfurly, Central Otago is rife with such names as Kyeburn, Gimmerburn, Hoggetburn, and Wedderburn as a result, and the area is still occasionally referred to as \\"Thomson's Barnyard\\". Thomson was a founder of the Otago and Southland Institutes of New Zealand, to which he contributed numerous papers on scientific subjects including ethnological studies. Through his knowledge of Hindustani and Malay, he became interested in comparative linguistics and developed a theory of racial diffusion based on philological evidence. He was also a keen amateur painter of landscapes, working mostly in oils. His paintings have little artistic merit but from a topographical viewpoint are of some interest today. Thomson married Jane Williamson of Dunedin at \\"Kaikorai Bank\\", Dunedin on the 7 October 1858 Papers Past, Otago Witness, 16 Oct 1858, p.5. He died at his home in Invercargill on 16 October 1884. By marriage he was related to the Hall-Jones family, whose number included William Hall-Jones, a former Prime Minister of New Zealand. Thomson was responsible for the planning of the city of Invercargill in Southland, New Zealand and his mausoleum is in the St. John's Cemetery in Waikiwi, Invercargill. His descendants have written numerous books which contain authoritative information on his life in New Zealand. Thomson's great- grandson, John Hall-Jones, was a historian specializing in the history of southern New Zealand. Legacy in Singapore During his government service in Singapore, Thomson was responsible for many projects: *Thomson's 1852 report on Singapore's water supply led in 1862 to approval of the Thomson Reservoir, now MacRitchie Reservoir. *He made an elaborate survey of the Straits of Singapore, in conjunction with Captain Congalton who was largely responsible for clearing pirates from Malayan waters. He also surveyed Keppel Harbour. In 1829, he surveyed the Tombs of the Malayan Princes. *He carried out repairs and lowering of the Coleman Bridge. *He was the architect and builder of: **Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca, **Hajjah Fatimah Mosque, **the spire for the St. Andrew's Cathedral, **Dalhousie Obelisk, a monument, **European Seaman's Hospital, **the first bridge across the Kallang River, known as Thomson Bridge, and **Tan Tock Seng Hospital at Serangoon Road.

He lives in South Wairarapa, New Zealand. Biography Silver was born in 1945 and attended Wellington College, later completing a B.A. at Victoria University of Wellington in psychology and sociology and Asian Studies. He worked initially as a boilermaker's assistant on Groote Eylandt, Northern Territory, Australia and later as safari guide based in Darwin. Returning to NZ he developed and sold short skis, the Fiessen Resin 120 before travelling in Asia where he worked briefly as an advisor to the Indian High Altitude Warfare school in Gulmarg. At London’s Tulse Hill School in the UK he taught English as a second language. His best-known cartoon series, Bogor, was written for the Listener Magazine and featured a lone woodsman and the forest animals that were his only companions (especially a hedgehog). An earlier cartoon, OB (written under the pseudonym \\"Roux\\"), had as its main characters a bird, a snake, and a rock, and was initially inspired by Silver's time spent in the Australian outback. Bogor first appeared in the Listener in 1973, and was New Zealand's longest-running published cartoon series. He is well known in New Zealand for his spoof Country Calendar television programs like The Radio Controlled Sheep Dog, Rural Music, Non Stress Farming and Rural Fashions. He is known internationally for his humorous cat art books (created in collaboration with painter and photographer Heather Busch: Why Cats Paint, Why Paint Cats, and Dancing with Cats, and the Museum of Non Primate Art, (monpa.com), as well as his spoofs Kokigami: The Intimate Art of the Little Paper Costume (Japanese paper decoration for the tumescent male genitalia, also in collaboration with Heather Busch), and The Naughty Victorian Hand Book: The Rediscovered Art of Erotic Hand Manipulation (with illustrator Jeremy Bennett). Other books include What Bird Did That? A Driver's Guide to Some Common Birds of North America (co-authored with Peter Hansard), The Kama Sutra for Cats (illustrated by Margaret Woodhouse) and Versability, a poetry game similar to Dictionary, where players create new lines for poems rather than new meanings for words (co-authored by his wife Melissa da Souza). His most successful book to date is Why Cats Paint that has sold over 750,000 copies worldwide. He has over one million books in print and been interviewed about them on television in the USA, Germany, and the UK. (The Daily Show, Jon Stewart, \\"The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing.\\") One of his inventions is the sport of GolfCross, played on a golf course with aerial goal-nets and a golf ball in the shape of a rugby ball. There are Golfcross courses in France, Germany, Argentina, Scotland, England, Ireland, and New Zealand. Silver's last project (co-authored with Martin O'Connor) was a relationship book titled \\"Everything He Hasn't Told You Yet: A New Way to Get Men talking About Stuff That Matters\\". The book uses the Scenario Method that works by putting a man at the center of hypothetical situations thus allowing him to share what he really thinks and feels. Everything He Hasn't Told You Yet was released in the United States in October 2007. The book received a starred review in the Library Journal (US).

He was awarded the Harmon Trophy for Latvia in 1933, and was considered a national hero, in analogous fashion to Charles Lindbergh.Operation Last Chance: One Man's Quest to Bring Nazi Criminals to Justice, by Efraim Zuroff, Macmillan, Nov 10, 2009 p. 117 Cukurs built at least three aircraft of his own design. In 1937 he made a tour visiting Japan, China, Indochina, India and the Soviet Union, flying the C 6 wooden monoplane \\"Trīs zvaigznes\\" (registration YL-ABA) of his own creation. The aircraft was powered by a De Havilland Gipsy engine. Cukurs also designed the Cukurs C-6bis prototype dive bomber in 1940.  Participation in the Arajs Kommando  During the occupation of Latvia by Nazi Germany in the summer of 1941, Cukurs became a member of the notorious Arajs Kommando, which was responsible for many of the crimes against humanity under the direction of the SD, the Nazi security and intelligence service. In his book The Holocaust in Latvia, 1941-1945, Latvian historian Andrew Ezergailis writes that Cukurs played a leading role in the atrocities that were committed in the Riga ghetto in conjunction with the Rumbula massacre on 30 November 1941. Also available in English as: Andrew Ezergailis, The Holocaust in Latvia, 1941–1944: The Missing Center (1996), . After the war, surviving witnesses reported that Cukurs had been present during the ghetto clearance and fired into the mass of Jewish civilians. According to eyewitness sources, Cukurs was the most recognizable Latvian SD man at the scene of the Rumbula massacre. Ezergailis states that \\"although Arājs' men were not the only ones on the ghetto end of the operation, to the degree they participated in the atrocities there, the chief responsibility rests on Herberts Cukurs' shoulders.\\"Ezergailis, The Holocaust in Latvia, at pages 192 and 267, n.55 Cukurs was described as follows: Later, Ezergailis retracted these interpretations, saying that in light of new documents, it would be wrong to claim that Cukurs had participated in the Rumbula shooting or the burning of the Riga synagogue. During interviews with the press, Ezergailis stated that there is no evidence that Cukurs had been at the pits at Rumbula, and that it has not been proven that Cukurs was \\"the most eager shooter of Jews in Latvia\\". According to another account, Cukurs also participated in the Burning of the Riga synagogues. According to Bernard Press in his book The Murder of the Jews in Latvia, Cukurs burned the synagogue on Stabu Street, but only after dragging Jews out of the neighboring houses and locking them inside: Time magazine reported at the time of Cukurs' death in 1965 that his crimes included the Riga synagogue fire, the drowning of 1,200 Jews in a lake; and his participation in the 30 November 1941 murder of 10,600 people in a forest near Riga.  Postwar flight and assassination  Cukurs retreated to Germany with German forces. After the war, Cukurs emigrated to Brazil via the ratlines. The Brazilian Consulate in Marseille issued the visa for permanent residency on 18 December 1945. The visa did not list his wife's name, but it identified three minor children: Gunārs, Antinea and Herberts.Visa number 42575 issued by Brazilian Consulate in Marseilles France on 18 December 1945. Once in Brazil, Cukurs established a business in São Paulo, flying Republic RC-7 Seabees on scenic flights. While living in South America, he neither hid nor tried to conceal his identity. Cukurs is now known to have been assassinated by Mossad agents, who persuaded him to travel to Uruguay under the pretense of starting an aviation business, after it was learned that he would not stand trial for his participation in the Holocaust. An acquaintance named \\"Anton Künzle”, in reality the disguised Mossad agent Yaakov Meidad, cabled Cukurs from Montevideo. He was invited to a house in a remote suburb of the city that had just been rented by a man from Vienna. Cukurs was shot in the head twice with a suppressed automatic pistol after a short but violent struggle that was not heard by neighbours. His body, found in a trunk on 6 March, had several gunshot wounds elsewhere, and his skull was shattered. Next to his body, several documents were left pertaining to his involvement in the murder of Jews in the Riga Ghetto. Media outlets in South America and Germany received a note stating: The note was initially dismissed as a prank, but then police were notified and the body was discovered.  Legacy and controversy  American-born Israeli historian and Nazi hunter Efraim Zuroff has pointed out that the fact that Cukurs wasn't prosecuted has allowed for what he believes are \\"attempts by right-wing nationalists and his family to totally exonerate Cukurs and by other Latvians to question or diminish his individual culpability\\" and \\"to restore him to hero status in Latvia and whitewash his massive guilt\\". In 2004 postal envelopes with the image of Cukurs were issued and distributed by National Power Unity, a far-right nationalist political party in Latvia. The act was condemned by Yad Vashem, as well as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Latvia Artis Pabriks in a statement saying that \\"those who produced such envelopes in Latvia evidently do not understand the tragic history of World War II in Latvia or in Europe\\". The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that Cukurs was \\"guilty of war crimes\\", and that he \\"took part in the activities of the notorious Arajs Kommando, which participated in the Holocaust and was responsible for the killing of innocent civilians. The General Prosecutor's Office of Latvia has twice rejected the exoneration of Herberts Cukurs\\". In summer of 2005 an exhibition titled \\"Herberts Cukurs: The Presumption of Innocence\\" was organized in Liepāja by K@2, a culture and art NGO run by Swedish documentary director Carl Biorsmark. One of the exhibition rooms featured testimonies and witness accounts both accusing and exonerating Cukurs, while another showed portrait of Cukurs, his supposed killer Anton Künzle and a photo of Cukurs' corpse, beaten beyond recognition. Biorsmark commented on the exhibition saying, \\"This is what artists have to do – stay in the middle and raise question marks,\\" The exhibition faced heavy criticism from various pundits, as well as the Latvian Jewish community who called it an attempt to rehabilitate a war criminal. Episode 1 of National Geographic's 2009 series Nazi Hunters recreated Mossad's assassination operation of Cukurs. On 11 October 2014, a musical Cukurs. Herberts Cukurs, produced by Juris Millers, premiered in Liepāja. \\"We are not Herbert Cukurs' advocates and we are not his judges,” Millers said at the premier, “I hope this performance will make you think.\\" Another performance initially scheduled for 17 March, the day after the Remembrance day of the Latvian legionnaires, was postponed in fear of \\"serious provocations\\". The musical was criticised by Zuroff tweeting he was \\"utterly disgusted\\" by it, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the musical a \\"vivid example\\" of open manifestations of neo-Nazism that he alleged had become \\"routine\\" in Latvia and other Baltic countries. Minister of Foreign Affairs of Latvia Edgars Rinkēvičs said the production “is not in good taste” and \\"cannot, in any way, be supported\\", but defended the producer's right to free speech. In 2020 Stephan Talty published a fact-based account of the Mossad's hunt for Cukurs, titled The Good Assassin: How a Mossad Agent and a Band of Survivors Hunted Down the Butcher of Latvia.

Audible ringing is typically a repeated tone that is not necessarily synchronous with the cadence of the power ringing signal that is sent to the called party. Audible ringing is usually generated in the switching system closest to the calling party, especially when under the control of strict implementations of Signalling System No. 7 and the Customized Application of Mobile Enhanced Logic (CAMEL) signaling system. It may also be generated in the distant switch, transmitted in-band, so that in analog networks the caller could monitor the quality of the voice path of the connection before the call is established. Remote call progress indication permits customized tones or voice announcements by a distant switch in place of the ringing tone. The ringing tone is often also called ringback tone. However, in formal telecommunication specifications that originate in the Bell System in North America, ringback has a different definition. It is a signal used to recall either an operator or a customer at the originating end of an established telephone call. It is also needed for coin-telephone lines to ring the telephone when the customer has hung up prematurely, for example to collect required overtime deposits. National characteristics =Europe= Many European countries use tones which follow the recommendation of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute. Almost all of these tones are 425 Hz; France uses 440 Hz. Typically, the pattern is 1 second of tone followed by 3 to 5 seconds of silence. =Japan= In Japan, the standard audible ringing tone is a repeating 1-second tone with a 2-second pause between. The tone has a frequency of 400 ± 20 Hz, and the amplitude modulation is 15 to 20Hz. =North America= In North America (excluding Mexico, Central America and parts of the Caribbean), the standard audible ringing tone is a repeated cadence of a two-second tone and four seconds of silence. The signal is composed of the frequencies and . =United Kingdom, Ireland, Commonwealth nations= In the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and many Commonwealth nations, it is a double ring. For most countries, it consists of a 0.4-second pulse, a 0.2-second pause, a 0.4-second pulse, and a 2-second pause. In all cases except Australia, the pulse is made by mixing a 400 Hz and 450 Hz sine wave; Australia uses up to three different combinations of frequencies. The example shown is created by mixing 400, 425, and 450 Hz sine waves. =India= In India, the ringing tone is called caller ringback tone (CRBT), which varies with different network operators. Personalized ringing tones Some telecommunication carriers have offered a service called of ringback tones, which play a song of the subscriber's choice in lieu of the standard ringing tone. Patents for personalized ringing tone delivery systems were first filed in Korea by Kang-seok Kim (10-1999-0005344) in October 1999 and in the United States by Mark Gregorek et al. (U.S. patent 5,321,740), and Neil Sleevi (U.S. patent 4,811,382). The first functional ringing tone replacement system was invented by Karl Seelig (U.S. patents 7,006,608 and 7,227,929). In 2001, Seelig's prototype was described in the Orange County Register and the Economist Magazine. Onmobile Global Ltd. India filed a patent entitled Method and system for customizing ringing tone in an inter-operator telecommunication system on Nov, 18 2010.US 20100290602. Onmobile Global Ltd. India, Method and system for updating social networking site with ring back tone information Oct, 7 2010: US 201002558. The first US national carrier offering this service was Verizon Wireless in 2004. Because of low sales, AT&T; stopped offering ringback tones in 2014. =Ringback music= Also known as caller tunes in some countries, such as India, ringback music is a service offered by mobile network operators to permit subscribers to select music or even install personalized recorded sounds for audible ringing. =Ringback advertising= Ringback tone advertising (AdRBT) was introduced using a range of models in several commercial markets in 2008. In America, Ring Plus offered the first interactive advertisement platform. In Turkey, 4play Digital Workshop launched 'TonlaKazaan' AdRBT with Turkcell, and Xipto AdRBT launched in the United States with Cincinnati Bell wireless; OnMobile launched an Ad-supported Music RBT program in India with Vodafone. 4Play Digital workshop accumulated several hundred thousand users of their service in the first few months of commercial deployment, and received an innovation award in February 2009 at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. AdRBT typically rewards the caller or the called party with discounted Music RBT service, free minutes, cash, or other rewards in return for accepting advertising messages integrated with Music Ringback, or for selecting advertisements instead of music as a personalized advertising ringback. In May 2011, Adfortel started the first ad-sponsored calling service in Austria with Orange, with users hearing a targeted advertisement instead of the regular waiting ring tone. A Juniper Research report released in January 2011 predicts that ringback tone advertising will reach $780 million annually by 2015. =Interactive reverse ringing tone= Interactive reverse ringback tones (IRRBT) are the same as normal ringback tones but have interactive functionalities and are targeted to the person who configures the tone. IRRBTs are heard on the telephone line by the caller who sets the IRRBT while the phone they are calling is ringing. Unlike the RBT, the IRRBT is often generated in the nearest switch and transmitted in-band, so the IRRBT will take precedence if both are configured. Social network ringback tones provide interactive social network content to subscribers. Mixcess is the first platform (social network) using IRRBTs in the United States. The IRRBT was developed by Ring Plus, Inc. (U.S. Patent No. 7,227,929 invented by Karl Seelig, et al.). The IRRBT can be used to share videos, music and messages from friends.

The company has operated Burger Kings since 1976 in locations across 23 U.S. states.Carrols Restaurant Group Investor Relations page (Retrieved 05 April 2018) The company formerly owned the restaurant chains Pollo Tropical, Taco Cabana, and Carrols. The original Carrols chain ceased operations in the United States in the mid-1970s. The last unaffiliated Carrols Restaurants existed in Finland. The chain was eventually bought out by another Finnish fast-food chain, Hesburger. In 2012, Hesburger announced that the brand Carrols would be discontinued; the last Carrols (in Oulunkylä) was renamed Hesburger on May 29. History An offshoot of the Tastee-Freez company, Carrols was named after the Tastee-Freez co-owner Leo Marantz's daughter, Carol. Herb Slotnick bought the franchise rights for the New York area and started opening restaurants in the Syracuse, New York area in the early 1960s. They expanded over the years throughout New York State. During the 1960s, a yellow slug character served as Carrols' first mascot, replaced in 1974 by a young blonde boy wearing a tweed suit and a Fedora hat. Most Carrols restaurant locations were converted to Burger King franchises in 1975, with less profitable stores shuttered. After the conversion, the Carrols brand was only found overseas in Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and Russia -- except for two stores: one on Roosevelt Avenue in Carteret, New Jersey, which closed in the late 1970s; and a single franchisee-owned store in Batavia, New York. Both of these latter two stores operated under the Carrols name into the 1980s, before closing. The Finnish group Carrols opened up several locations in St Petersburg, Russia in the mid- to-late 1990s. In 1998 it opened its first operation in Moscow located at the then-new Ohotni Riad Mall. Because of the 1998 Russian financial crisis, the operations did not generate enough sales for Carrols, and by 2000 all Carrols outlets in Russia had been closed. The Finnish restaurant company Hesburger started to buy out the last existing Carrols locations in Helsinki, Finland in the mid-2000s. On December 9, 2005, Carrols Holdings and Mimi's Café was filed for offerings. In February 2011 the company announced it was divesting itself of its two Central American-themed chains, Taco Cabana and Pollo Tropical, in a spin-off aimed at helping the company focus on its core Burger King operations. The sale of the two chains, collectively called the Fiesta Restaurant Group, was completed in May 2012. On February 20th 2019, Nation's Restaurant News reported that Carrols is to merge with Cambridge Franchise Holdings LLC in a deal worth 238 million dollars, which adds 55 Popeyes and 166 Burger Kings to Carrols' portfolio. Those restaurants will be in the southern United States \\"structured as a tax-free merger\\". Carrols will give Cambridge around 7.36 million common shares. Also included in the deal, Cambridge will get 9% of Carrols preferred stock. = Burger King = In June 2012, Carrols acquired 278 Burger King locations from Burger King for approximately $150 million. In exchange, the Burger King parent, Burger King Corporation took a 28.9% stake in the company. The transaction involved a line of credit that would be used by Carrols to renovate more than 450 of its stores. Theaters Beginning in the early 1970s, Carrols owned and operated the CinemaNational movie theater chain, until their sale to Mid-States Theaters and USA Cinemas in the early and mid-1980s. The theaters were concentrated in central New York State, but there were locations as far away as Wisconsin, Idaho and California. The chain consisted mostly of large single-screen locations that had been purchased from companies like Kallet, Hallmark and Dipson Theaters, along with new locations that were built by Slotnick. CinemaNational also built some triple-screen multiplex locations in sites like the Penn-Can Mall in Cicero, New York, and the Fayetteville Mall in Fayetteville.

The village church dates from the 14th and 15th centuries and is dedicated to Saint George but is sometimes referred to as the \\"Cathedral of the Tendring Hundred.\\" The village and the surrounding area, like much of East Anglia, had residents who were seething with Puritan sentiment during the early and middle years of the 17th century. By 1635, brothers Gregory and Simon Stone had departed for the Massachusetts Bay Colony as part of the wave of emigration that occurred during the Great Migration. They settled in Cambridge and Watertown, Massachusetts respectively.Thompson, Roger, Mobility & Migration, East Anglian Founders of New England, 1629-1640, Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1994.

It was near-missed by three German mines, a V1 flying bomb, and a V2 rocket. Between 1936 and 1939, AMES 24, one of the earliest Chain Home radar stations, was built in the area of Honeypot Lane and Hilliards Road. By 1941 it consisted of 3 358-foot steel, 4 247-foot wooden, and 2 120-foot reserve wooden towers – locally known as \\"the Pylons\\". The station was operational from the 1938 Czech Crisis onwards, and operated right through the war, plotting German aircraft during the Battle of Britain and the Blitz, and later the V2 rockets. In 1941 and 1942 it was also the first \\"Gee\\" Bomber Command HQ and monitoring station, helping to guide the RAF to Lübeck and Cologne. The Great Bromley RAF staff reached over 250 at its peak, some staying at the Lodge and in a camouflaged \\"B Site\\" nearby localled called \\"Bromley Camp\\". AMES 24 was near-missed by German bombs and mines on several occasions, but was not hit. Between 1940 and 1942 the station was defended by up to 100 soldiers, 3 Bofors, and several machine guns. Two guardhouses and three concrete tower bases still be seen on the two main sites.Air Ministry, RAF, Army, Home Office and Civil Defence files, TNA., 2 veterans' sound tapes, IWM., files at the RAF Museum, Civil Defence/Police files, (Essex Record Office), interviews with relatives of RAF and WAAF veterans; J P Foynes, \\"AMES 24--the Pylons at Gt Bromley\\", (2010). After the war, the old radar T (Transmitter) Site in Hilliards Road was used by Marconi for important radio and television tests, for Police, Fire Brigade and Civil Defence radio relay, and as a radio relay link between the US Air Force in England and Germany. A small party of American airmen lived locally in order to man the radio trailers. In 1982 CND staged two anti-nuclear demos at the USAF facility, without damage or arrests.Local press, Marconi Review, USAF files, correspondence with Police and Fire Brigade engineers and local families resident at the sites.

It is a geographical region defined morphologically by the sea, in terms of topography and soil, and also in its climate, flora and fauna. It is narrow in the north and broadens considerably towards the south, and is continuous with the exception of the short section where Mount Carmel reaches almost all the way to the sea. The Coastal Plain is bordered to the east by - north to south - the topographically higher regions of the Galilee, the low and flat Jezreel Valley, the Carmel range, the mountains of Samaria, the hill country of Judea known as the Shephelah, and the Negev Mountains in the south. To the north it is separated from the coastal plain of Lebanon by the cliffs of Rosh HaNikra, which jut out into the sea from the Galilee mountains, but to the south it continues into the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula. The plain can be conventionally divided into a number of areas: the Northern Coastal Plain borders Western Galilee in its northern part, and the Jezreel Valley in its southern part between Akko and Haifa, where it is also called the Plain of Zebulon; Hof HaCarmel, or the Carmel Coastal Plain, runs along the Mount Carmel range; the Sharon Plain continues down to northern Tel Aviv; the Central Coastal Plain stretches from Tel Aviv to the northern limit of the Gaza Strip, with the Nahal Shikma stream as its limit- there Israel's access to the Mediterranean ends, so that the so-called Israeli Southern Coastal Plain, also known as the Western Negev, actually consists of the hinterland of the Strip. For its entire length, the plain has sandy beaches and a Mediterranean climate. Physical geography The area was historically fertile in Biblical times, some of it being continually farmed ever since, although much turned over time into swampland, having to be converted back by Zionist pioneers. Today, the area is the center of the country's citrus farms, and contains some of the country's most successful agricultural settlements. The plain has soils made of two sorts of thick river deposits; one dark and heavy - ideal for growing field crops, and the other thin and sandy - ideal for growing citrus fruits. Despite its length, the plain is only crossed by two significant rivers; the Yarkon, which is long flowing from the Petah Tikva area into the Mediterranean, and the Kishon which is long, flowing into the Gulf of Acre north of Haifa. Human geography About 57% of Israel's population lives in the coastal plain, much of them in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area (Gush Dan) and Haifa metropolitan area. It is the most predominantly Jewish geographical region of Israel and accordingly the most predominantly Jewish region in the world, as Jews make up over 96% of the population in this region compared to 75% in the Negev, 70% in the Israeli portion of the Judean Mountains, and only 50% in the Galilee, and the Golan Heights. About 4,320,000 people live on the Israeli Coastal Plain (57% of the total Israeli population of 7,600,000). 4,200,000 million of them are Jews (97.2%), and 120,000 are Israeli Arabs. This accounts for approximately one-third of the world Jewish population, and almost three-quarters of Israeli Jews. The Israeli Coastal Plain has been populated for thousands of years, with the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) village of Atlit-Yam dating back some 9000 years. The PPNB village was swallowed by the sea due to a rise in sea level caused by the melting glaciers at the end of the last Ice Age. Wendy Blumfield, Israel's Atlantis, Jerusalem Post, 21-23 May 2009 Recent research has concluded that 5,500 years ago, during the Bronze Age, the Coastal Plain was a populated commercial and settlement center, and it is thought that at this time climate change led to the flooding of the area and the creation of many swamps, forcing a shift in human settlement patterns. Settlements are thought to have been spread across the plain, from Gaza up to the Galilee, with the land being an important trade route for the Egyptians. Regions Rosh HaNikra in the far north of the country Tel Aviv's coastline (seen from Jaffa) is highly urbanized The coastal plain includes the following geographical regions (from north to south): =Northern Coastal Plain= The Northern Coastal Plain or Plain of Asher stretches from Israel's third-largest city, Haifa, northwards to Rosh HaNikra on the Israel-Lebanon border. It separates the Western Galilee and the Jezreel Valley from the Mediterranean. Its southern segment borders the Jezreel Valley and is - rather unfittingly - known as the Plain of Zebulun. It is a fertile region containing the city of Nahariya and many moshavim and kibbutzim. There are many small islands and islets off the coast in this region. Often regarded as a separate region is the Acre coastal plain, which is crowded with urban areas including Acre and the northern suburbs of Haifa, known as the Krayot, as well as more agricultural areas. =Hof HaCarmel= The Hof HaCarmel (lit. \\"Carmel Coast\\") region is the Coastal Plain section stretching along the Mount Carmel range, from Haifa (more exactly: Rosh HaCarmel, the Mount Carmel cape that reaches almost all the way to the sea Zafrir Rinat, Green Haifa - Dollar Signs or Environmentalism, Haaretz, 15.09.2005), down to Nahal Taninim south of Zikhron Ya'akov. The soil of the Hof HaCarmel plain is rich and apart from the main city of Haifa in the north, most settlement here is made up of farming communities. The Hof HaCarmel Regional Council is an administrative unit which largely, but not fully, corresponds to the Hof HaCarmel geographic region. =Sharon Plain= The Sharon plain is the next stage down the Coastal Plain, running from Nahal Taninim (Zikhron Ya'akov) to Tel Aviv's Yarkon River. This area is Israel's most densely populated, containing a number of large towns and cities including Netanya and Herzliya as well as smaller communities inland. =Central Coastal Plain= The Israel's Central Coastal Plain also known as Judean Coastal Plain, is running from northern Tel Aviv's Yarkon River to the northern tip of the Gaza Strip marked by Nahal Shikma, the Central Coastal Plain contains cities such as Bat Yam, Rishon LeZion, Ashdod and Ashkelon, as well as agricultural communities. =Southern Coastal Plain= The Southern Coastal Plain extends around the Gaza Strip and is also known as the Negev Coastal Plain. The Israeli Coastal Plain includes a fraction of Negev Coastal Plain south of the Shikma Stream, while much of Negev Coastal Plain is included within the Gaza Strip. Geographically, the Negev Coastal Plain is the Southern extension to the Judean Coastal Plain (Central Israeli Coastal Plain), and in terms of geology, hydrology, fauna and flora. The Israeli Southern Coastal Plain is divided into two subdivisions: * the Besor region, a savanna-type area with a relatively large number of communities, in the north * the Agur-Halutza region in the south which is very sparsely populated.
