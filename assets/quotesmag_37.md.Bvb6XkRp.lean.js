His poems were the first to introduce socialist themes into Hebrew literature. Biography Early life and career Yehudah Leib Levin was born in Minsk, White Russia to a well-established Ḥasidic family. His father, Rabbi Baruch Chaim Levin, was a well-to-do merchant and scholar with a close relationship to Rabbi Shlomo Chaim Perlov of Koidanov, and his mother Miriam was the daughter of Ḥasidic epic poem in three parts, also concerning the social condition of the Russian Jews. Zionism As a reaction to the 1881 pogroms, Levin began to draw away from the socialist circles. He initially advocated for emigration to the United States; in an October 1881 letter to the Hebrew weekly Ha-Magid, he wrote: Levin in 1909 Nonetheless, Levin shortly thereafter joined the Ḥovevei Zion movement in Kiev and became an active supporter of emigration to Palestine. He publicly expressed agreement with Leon Pinsker's Auto-Emancipation, and in 1884 translated into Hebrew Benjamin Disraeli's novel Tancred, which visualizes the return of the Jews to their land. Levin was forced to leave Kiev in 1887 because of his Zionist activities. He settled in the small town of Tomashpil where, while continuing his literary work, he worked at a sugar factory owned by the Brodsky family. In 1890, he completed the poem \\"Daniyel be-gov ha- arayot\\" ('Daniel in the Lions’ Den'), highlighting the struggle against anti- Semitism and Levin's outspoken support of Zionism; the poem was not published until 1898 because of censorship. At the Sixth Zionist Congress in 1903, he was among the \\"Territorialists\\" who supported the plan to provide temporary refuge in British East Africa for European Jews facing anti-Semitism. Later life Levin returned to Kiev after the Soviet regime closed the Brodsky sugar factory following the Russian Revolution in 1918. His later years were marked by poverty in his daughter's home and persecution by the Yevsektsiya. He attended clandestine Zionist meetings in the city until he died on 30 November 1925. A selection of his memoirs, articles, and poems was published in 1968 as Zikhronot ve-Hegyonot ('Memoirs and Essays').

The wildlife management area centers along the Muskegon River about from its source at Houghton Lake, and it incorporates rural areas in Enterprise Township within Missaukee County and Lake Township within Roscommon County for an approximate total area of 1,024 acres (4.14 km²). It is controlled and maintained by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. The wildlife management area owes its creation to the Reedsburg Dam, which was constructed in 1940 along the Muskegon River to alleviate flooding from Houghton Lake. The resulting reservoir became known as the Dead Stream Flooding (or Dead Stream Swamp) at a fluctuating size of approximately 540 acres (2.19 km²). Location The area's headquarters are located at the Houghton Lake DNR Wildlife Office at 8717 North Roscommon Road (M-18) in the nearby village of Roscommon. The wildlife management area itself is mostly accessible from U.S. Route 127 exit 194 (M-55) and County Road 300, and the overall area is sparsely populated. Other nearby sizable communities are Houghton Lake just to the southeast and Lake City about west. The unconnected Houghton Lake Flats Flooding State Wildlife Management Area is just to the east, and a number of other protected areas are within close proximity, including North Higgins Lake State Park, South Higgins Lake State Park, Hartwick Pines State Park, Houghton Lake State Wildlife Research Area, Bear Creek Flooding State Wildlife Management Area, Backus Creek State Game Area, and Denton Creek Flooding State Wildlife Management Area. The forests surrounding the Dead Stream Flooding State Wildlife Management Area are also protected as state forest land managed by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources in the Au Sable State Forest and Pere Marquette State Forest. Activities The area is popular among campers, tourists, fishermen, and hunters. Common fish within the waters include pumpkinseed, bluegill, small and largemouth bass, native crayfish, northern pike, yellow perch, and bowfin. There are ample shore fishing locations and two public boating access points. The Dead Stream Flooding is mostly shallow and contains numerous underwater obstacles that make larger motorized vessels discouraged. The surrounding woodlands are open to seasonal waterfowl, turkey, and deer hunting. Other popular activities include bird watching, geocaching, photography, and canoeing/kayaking. Rustic camping is available at the Reedsburg Dam State Forest Campground on the northeast side of the dam. The campground is operated by the nearby North Higgins Lake State Park. Current status The Dead Stream Flooding with lower than normal water levels in July 2020 Beginning in August 2018, the Reedsburg Dam is undergoing major reconstruction lasting for at least one year, and the Dead Stream Flooding will be completely drained to allow for only the original flow of the Muskegon River. The construction is necessary to repair and rebuild the nearly 80-year-old earthen dike and concrete and steel structures of the dam. During the project, portions of the wetlands of the Dead Stream Flooding State Wildlife Management Area will be temporarily dried up; most of the lower water levels will take place around the Reedsburg Dam reservoir and not further upstream along the Muskegon River. When the construction project is complete, the reservoir was expected to slowly return to original levels by summer 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Michigan, the Reedsburg Dam reconstruction was delayed. While more than 90% of the dam project has been completed, the water levels are now expected to return to normal levels by fall 2020.

The woman of the house made the dish. In 2016, IIT Kharagpur applied to get the geographical Indication for Gohona Bori. Making of Gohona Bori History It is an age-old dish of Bengal. Before the arrival of the British in India, poppy seed was not used in Gohona Bori. After the Battle of Palashi, the British discovered a market of illegal opium in China. British forced the farmers of the Rarh region of Bengal to cultivate poppy and extorting large amounts of opium from them into China. Poppy seeds were dropped after the opiate was extracted. In the past, poppy seeds became the cooking material of Bankura, Birbhum, Bardhaman and Midnapore districts. Thus the poppy seeds are used in Gohona Bori in Midnapore. In 1930, Seba Maiti, a student of Shantiniketan presented Gohona Bori to Rabindranath Tagore which was made by her mother, Hirnmayi Debi, and grandmother, Sheratakumari Debi. Tagore was so attracted to Bori that he wrote them a letter seeking permission to preserve the photographs of Gohona Bori at the Art Building of Shantiniketan. As a result, Gohona Bori gained popularity as a sign of art. Abanindranath Tagore considered it to be an art. So he considered the thought of baking it or eating it was considered an act of destruction. He noted a similarity with historical artwork and arranged an exhibition. Nandalal Bose described it as a jewel of the Bengali mother's jewelry box. He expressed his desire to publish a book on it. Gohona Bori were exhibited in the 59th session of Indian National Congress held in Kalyani in 1954. In 1990, the West Bengal government took part in a food festival organized by the women of Tamluk's Gohona Bori maker. They prepared Gohona Bori in front of thousands of curios men in Kolkata. In 1995 a Gohona Bori marketing group was established in Tamluk. Design Each cook chooses their own design.

This place is located in Lower Dungeshwor, the highest place in Dailekh district. This places is located in the confluence of Loohre and Karnali river, at the level of 544 meters from the sea level. In ancient times, here is believed to be the end of the day. There are two temples by Shideshwor Mahadev and Dungal Temple in Dungeshwor. According to Ancient holy flame myth and Vaishwankar myth of Dailakh district, this area is considered to be a place in the center of five famous Panchkoshi, five in Dailekh district. Because of these diverse reasons it is considered to be a mantle. This bridge is currently located in the village of Naule Katuwal connected to Dullu Municipality. This campusphere is located near the Karnali highway in Karnali river and Larkakhola's turbulence. Interesting historical context has been popular about the predecessor of this loop. Dailekh has two places named Lower Dhungeshwor and Upper Dhungeshwor.  Establishment  According to myth, a Brahmin named Jyotikha Upadhyay had been traveling daily from the house daily while completing Panchali and Lohar Sangam in Panangli and Lohar, after completing the Hindu rituals and Santana and entering the cave. In this cave, he used to be involved in Shiva's worship and meditation, chastisement and after returning to his own house, have seen some disability in the hands of Brahmin. Even though his health condition was weak, despite of the continuation, in 1935, he met a saint named Sagar Giri on the banks of Karnali river. So he requested Sagar Giri to continue this worship because it is not possible cause of his disability. After accepting the request of the Brahmin, the young man of Giri Thar, brought the Shivaling, established the temple and became the new lord of divine power. Then devotees and kings together with the protection of the temple made Damaha, Slogan, and idol for worshiping in the temple. Then slowly the temple's rise also increased.  Building the temple  Dhungel Temple, Dungeshwor The temple's sequence of worship started taking over the area. After some times, the two sisters Ganga and Jamuna of Dhungta from Achham district came to this place with the intention of worshiping God without getting married. Seeing their involvement, Sagar Giri handled the temple to them residing Himalayas as an eternal life. Because of the worship and taking care of this temple, they started calling as \\"Devaki\\", meaning goddess. Only then, the order of worshiping Devi's hands went to this place. And the number of deviates also increased. Afterwards, the then king Prithvi Narayan Shah picked up Damaha, Nagara and symbol in this temple was taken to Hanuman Dhoka, Kathmandu, and was conquered by his gangs. At the time of worshiping at Sidheshwor Mahadev in the morning, the dormitory kept in Hanumanhoka has started itself. In 1960 BS, when the Damaha, Nagara and symbol was returned to Sidheshwor Mahadev temple, they offered two hope programs including the pillar of the temple. In this context, an official from Kathmandu, who proposed to marry the Ganga and Jamuna, was worshiping in the temple. Devi Ganga made the temple of Siddheshwar Mahadev if he had a condition to marry her officials, and the officer made a covenant with the Ganga and fulfilled the promise. Similarly, In 1961 BS, one Khatri of Nepa village married Jamuna by promising to build the temple of Dhungel Mahadev. Khatri also built the temple of Dhungel Mahadev following his promise. In 1961 BS, Saint Sagar Giri of this temple died and Narottam Giri operated a parade of Sideshwor Temple. The cord of being saint was also recovered from his father and then started.  Recent priests and saints  After the death of Narottam Giri, Kabiraj Giri (B.S. 1980), Khagendra Giri (B.S. 1998), Jaydev Giri (B.S. 2007), Sundar Giri (B. S. 2030), Choura Giri (B. S. 2034), Choura Giri's wife, Ranga Giri (B.S. 2040), Choura Giri's son Sukdev Giri (B.S. 2043) and since 2054, Khadga Giri has been taking charge of Mahant. Similarly Siddheshwar Mahadev, Kalika Bhagwati, Ganeshji, Kalsaini Bhariab, Batuk Bharab and other gods and goddesses in this temple have been handled and worshiped by this crew, however, due to the controversy on being head of the temple, during Kabiraj Giri's period there was no provision of regulations in worship. During that period someone unknown saint called Lamsal, started to worship but he was cursed and started to suffer. And then he gave up. After that Chhadunge Brahman and Lasmal Brahman have too gave up because of suffering. After 2036 BS, the offspring of Jyotikhar Upadhaya, Bishnu Prasad Upadhya has been operating the worship of the temple till now.  Tradition to worship There is a belief that this temple's natural holy flame is connected to the vessel of the navel, and need to fire any other holy lights. If failed, could be reason to suffer of dishonor, drought, famine, and hunger. The temple of Sidheshwor Mahadev is merely opening at the day of Vijayadashmi. From the day of great degradation of Dashain (i.e. Ghatasathapana), the temple is given legitimate offerings along with religious sounds and music and are immersed on the day of Vijayadashmi. In the temple, the hope template is written as \\"श्री ५ पृथ्वीवीरविक्रम शाहदेव विक्रम संवत १९६०\\", meaning \\"His Highness Prithivi Bir Bikram Shah Dev Bikram Samvat 1960\\" and \\"वि.सं. १९८१\\", meaning (B.S. 1981) and \\"वि. सं. १९८९\\", meaning (B.S. 1989) on two consecutive large bells.

The virus was initially observed within renal tumors in 1934 by Baldwin Lucké, and more recently has become identifiable through the use of PCR in samples isolated from frog tumors. RaHV-1 causes renal tumors within the northern leopard frog, Rana pipiens. The virus has not yet been isolated in vitro within cell lines, meaning that while its existence and symptoms are fairly evident, its methods of transmission, cell infection, and reproduction are largely unknown. Since it has not been cultured in vitro, temporal studies regarding the kinetics of virus growth and biological and molecular events in the replication cycle have not been undergone extensively. Ranid herpesvirus 1, along with Ranid herpesvirus 2 and 3, are the only herpes viruses known to infect amphibians.  Structure  With its lipid envelope, the virus is approximately 170 nm in diameter. The capsid itself has been measured to be approximately 90-110 nm in diameter and expresses T=16 icosahedral symmetry. The complete virion includes a capsid with triangular facets. The facets contain five shared capsomeres per edge. The facet edges enclose three central capsomeres. The entire capsid contains 162 capsomeres. Other viruses within the family Alloherpesviridae have been shown to have spherical lipid envelopes with capsids expressing T=16 icosahedral symmetry, fitting with these measurements.  Genome  Ranid herpesvirus 1 is a double-stranded DNA virus approximately 217kbp in size. The genome is highly linear in structure and has a GC content of 45-47%. RaHV-1 and similar amphibian herpesviruses have been placed in the family Alloherpesviridae instead of being associated with mammalian herpesviruses. This is due to the fact that it shares many of its genomic and pathogenic characteristics with Ictalurid herpesvirus 1, another virus within the family Alloherpesviridae.  Replication cycle  A healthy northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) in its habitat During the cooler winter months, the virus replicates rapidly without the host exhibiting many symptoms. Once the warmer months roll around, viral replication rates dramatically lower to the point of little to no replication, and tumor growth begins. This is not due to the lack of an immune response in the frogs during hibernation, but the temperature of the months themselves. This is illustrated by the fact that tumors can be cleansed of the virus by exposing them to high temperatures, even in the absence of antibodies. This is also seen in the studies in which warm frogs nearly devoid of tumors are cooled down, reinitiating viral replication. Mature tumors are often devoid of virus particles, while younger tumors in the warm weather still usually contain viral particles.  Entry into the cell  Ranid herpesvirus 1 has not yet been isolated within cell lines, despite multiple efforts utilizing various cells from amphibian, mammalian, and piscine species. The only case of successful transfections of an organism with the virus has been seen following the injection of the virus into tadpoles. These injections cause the host, once matured, to begin exhibiting renal adenocarcinoma. This has led to the theory that the virus is transmitted by the infection of oocytes in tumor- bearing female frogs. While not much is known specifically on the entry of RaHV-1 into host cells, the family to which the virus belongs, Alloherpesviridae, has been shown to have particular mechanisms of entry and replication. Glycoprotein complexes embedded within the viral envelope of these viruses attach to receptors within the host cell's membrane. These activated receptors then mediate endocytosis of the virus into the cell. Whether the virus enters specifically through endocytosis or membrane fusion is still not known in all cases; it is believed to vary depending on the host cell type.  Replication and release of virus and viral genome  Since this specific virus has never been cultured in vitro, the exact replication cycle has not been specifically identified. However, other viruses in the Alloherpesviridae family undergo genomic replication by utilizing the host cell's nucleus, eventually leading to lysis. The steps to this method of replication (excluding the aforementioned process of cell entry) are as follow: This is a simplified diagram of the herpes simplex virus. A notable difference is that Alloherpesviridae viruses are not shown to go to the endoplasmic reticulum after assembly, but instead, head to the golgi apparatus before being released from the cell. Except for this difference, viruses within Alloherpesviridae have a very similar replication scheme. # The capsid is transported to the cell's nucleus. # Viral DNA enters the host's nucleus via nuclear pores. # Early genes within the viral DNA are transcribed by the host, allowing for the priming of further transcription of viral DNA. # The early viral genes are then transcribed by host polymerase II. # The newly formed early viral mRNA is then transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm. # The early viral mRNA is translated into early proteins. # These early proteins are transported into the nucleus, where they are involved in the replication of viral DNA. # Viral DNA-dependent DNA polymerase synthesizes multiple copies of viral DNA. # The late viral genes are then transcribed by host polymerase II. # The newly formed late viral mRNA is translated into late proteins, which are involved in the formation and structure of the capsid. # These late proteins are transported back into the nucleus. # The virus is then assembled in the nucleus, which at this point has been modified such as to become a factory for viral DNA. # Herpes glycoproteins modify the nucleus, allowing the budding of the newly formed virus through the inner lamella of the nuclear membrane to begin. # The virus is transported to the Golgi apparatus and subsequently released from the cell's membrane  Interactions with and modifications of host  The effects infection has within Rana pipiens by Ranid herpesvirus 1 are most apparent in the renal system and adjacent fatty areas. Fluid begins to build up in the abdomen of the infected organism, causing large ascites. Once the viral genome is incorporated into the kidney cells, cellular replication and/or death is modified in a way such that tumors begin to form rapidly in this region. Once these tumors begin to metastasize, however, it is possible for the formation of tumors to spread throughout the body of the organism instead of staying in one specific region.  Tropism  The virus appears to have specificity for renal tissues within the species Rana pipiens. It is possible that this is because the glycoproteins embedded within the viral envelope attach to and are selective to the membrane proteins found on their renal tissues. Once tumors have grown though, the tumors can metastasize to other areas of the body. This begs the question of if the virus has some way of spreading to the rest of the body, although a lack evidence seems to point away from this conclusion.  Associated diseases and pathology  A bisected human kidney exhibiting multiple renal adenocarcinomas Ranid herpesvirus 1 causes renal adenocarcinomas in northern leopard frogs, Rana pipiens. The resulting tumors, generally large and papillary in nature, are referred to as Lucké tumors. Due to the strong link between viral replication rate and temperature, tumor growth is most rapid in the warmer summer months. Growth slows during the winter, although eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions may still be found within wintering frogs that have been infected with the virus. The following summer, tumor growth reinitiates. These tumors can metastasize and result in tumors located elsewhere in the organism. The virus can be found in the primary tumor and metastatic cells of the bladder, fat body, and liver of the organism. On average, there is approximately 5 X 1011 virus particles per gram of algid tumor. Tumor growth can be identified through the use of light and electron microscopy. Lethargy, ascites, emaciation, and death are the most common visible symptoms of a diseased organism, although diseased frogs may not show significant signs of being infected until the disease has advanced to later stages. The ascitic fluid of the organism can also contain neoplastic cells that may or may not be malignant and cancerous. The disease kills many of the infected following replication that year. When examined posthumously, the tumors on these frogs are commonly seen to be white in color. There is no known treatment for this virus, and the best way to control it is to allow the frogs to die off without reproducing and spreading the disease to other frogs.

Aizer's research focuses on child health and well-being, in particular the effect of societal factors and social issues on children's health.  Biography  Aizer received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Amherst College in Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1991, a Master of Science at Harvard University in 1995, and a PhD at the University of California, Los Angeles in 2002. She then went on to a postdoctoral fellowship at Princeton University's Center for Research on Child Bearing, before becoming a professor and the chair of the economic department at Brown University where she currently works. She is also a co-director of the NBER's program on children.  Research  As a labor and health economist, Aizer has an interest in child health and well being. Her scholarly interests are child health, child support, domestic violence, Medicaid, poverty and welfare, and her recent focus is on the inter-generational transmission of health and income.  Inter-generational transmission of poverty  Together with economist Janet Currie, Aizer published a paper in Science as a co-author, arguing that inequality of outcomes could be passed on through maternal disadvantage. Descending from the bad parental health, maternal disadvantage leads to the poor health of the children at birth. This also leads to less access in medical care, further worsening the health of children. Yet, the health of the newborn children is improving among the most disadvantaged population, likely due to the improvement in public policies and the increase in the knowledge of infant health. With Shari Eli, Joseph Ferrie and Adriana Lleras-Muney, Aizer also estimated the long-term impact of cash transfers to poor families from the records of applicants to the Mother's Pension program and death records. From this the authors found that the male children of the accepted applicants lived longer, got more years of schooling, were less likely to be underweight and had higher income than that of the rejected mothers. Cooperating with Laura Stroud and Stephen Buka, Aizer studied the effect of maternal stress the offspring outcomes. They found that the exposure to high levels of stress hormone negatively affects the offspring's cognition, health and educational attainment. By establishing the relationship between the cortisol level and the development of human capital, the study also reveals the impact of elevated cortisol on the offspring, making a link with the topic of inter-generational persistence of poverty.  Child health and well being  A major topic of Aizer's work has been access for children to social services. Aizer has found that barriers public health insurance enrollment include the information and the administrative costs. These barriers differ based on race. Aizer also published an article focusing on adult supervision and child behavior, examining the issue of children spending their school years without adult supervision due to the growth in the number of women entering the workforce and the high cost of child care. In 2015, Aizer published an article on juvenile incarceration in the Quarterly Journal of Economics with Joseph J. Doyle, Jr. In this study, they estimate the effects of juvenile incarceration on the completion of high school and adult recidivism by analyzing the incarceration tendency of randomly assigned judges. Together, they found incarceration of juveniles significantly reduces rates of returning to school while increasing the frequency of juveniles classified as emotionally or behaviorally disordered when juveniles do return to school.

Pumphouse and Wells in Boise, Idaho, include a rectangular building, 27 feet by 50 feet, with battered walls that conform to the inward slope of two drill derricks which supported the original structure. The building houses two pumps that circulate geothermally heated water from wells installed in 1890. Natural hot water from the pumphouse was piped to residential and commercial customers beginning in the 1890s. With History In 1887 dairy owner Frank Davis began drilling artesian wells on a ranch owned by his brother, Tom Davis, at Crane Gulch. The Davis brothers intended to supply water to Boise City, but their plan was not successful. In 1888 Boise City pioneers Christopher W. Moore, Nathan Falk, and John Broadbent began promoting a plan to fund an artesian water company. The Boise Water Works was organized in 1890 with $200,000 in capital stock, with directors George L. Shoup, William H Ridenbaugh, Christopher W. Moore, Timothy Reagan, Peter Sonna, Alfred Eoff, George Ainslie, Richard Z. Johnson, and Hosea B. Eastman.Eastman was a partner with his brother in the Eastman water works at Hulls Gulch, and the Eastman brothers were owners of Boise's Overland Hotel, later rebuilt and renamed the Eastman Building. Also in 1890, the Artesian Water and Land Improvement Company began to provide water for the city. Officers of the company were David Heron, Auren G. Redway, Samuel H. Hays, Nathan Falk, John Case, Lazare Weil, and Frank R. Coffin. After a dispute over city hydrant contracts, the two water works merged in 1891 to form the Artesian Hot and Cold Water Company, with Christopher W. Moore as president. Moore was the first residential customer of the company, and his home, now the Moore-Cunningham House, on Warm Springs Avenue was the first house in the United States to be heated geothermally. The company also provided hot water to Boise's Natatorium (1892-1934). The two wells covered by the pumphouse were operating by 1891. They were sunk 32 feet apart using 6-inch pipe about 400 feet deep. Water mains were made of iron strapped pine wood from Puget Sound. The wells provided a combined water flow of 1,600,000 gallons per day at a temperature of about 170 °F. In 1892 the Artesian Hot and Cold Water Company published a list of rules and regulations. The company's public policy was formed before water was metered, and domestic customers were charged by the number of rooms in their houses, and \\"no person or family shall be permitted to furnish water to stone masons, bricklayers, or plasterers...\\" Barbers were charged $1.00 per month, and butchers were charged $2.00.

The Bushwick Hotel's artistry ranged from fashion to photography, cinema and visual arts and served to influence and fund their music. The band also started a web series called Live By the Sword, directed by Dale Krupla. They shot the series in their recording studio and while on the road, inviting local bands and bands on tour to play live and participate in interviews. History Lead singer and guitarist Gregory Ferreira was born and raised in Boston and started playing the guitar professionally at age nine. As a seasoned producer and audio engineer, Gregory moved to Brooklyn in 2006 and started Live by the Sword Studio. While living in Brooklyn, Gregory recorded his first solo album, The Suitcase Album, played with Missing Ships, and since has worked on a variety of jazz and hip hop projects alongside other musicians. Gregory met Matt Lon Vor, Erik Naslund, Rudy Temp, and Ben Teters and collaborated with them to start a band. Matt played the soprano saxophone and clarinet, Erik played bass guitar while Rudy played slide guitar and all three worked in unison in providing background vocals. The release of the video for Graffiti of the Young Man's Mind, the title track from their debut album, sought to capture the themes associated with the mind of an adolescent experiencing detachment from their environment, drugs and escapism. Director and fashion photographer Catherine Westergaard and Dale Krupla produced the film within two weeks while collaborating with the band for New York fashion week to do an event called Fashionably Late. Catherine later would do an interview with Royal Young chronicling her experiences with the C24 gallery opening, for which she debuted the Graffiti of the Young Man's Mind video. As an up-and-coming local band, the artists sought to build a name for themselves and largely found their calling in street art. Gregory and Rudy would sell city maps and paintings along Bedford Ave in Williamsburg. The band also invested in their brand by opening an alternative mall called the Rock n’ Shop. The mall offered free live performances from yours truly for all ages, free food and drinks, arts and crafts and tattoos and haircuts. In 2017, The Bushwick Hotel released their single Show You the Way. Thereafter, they released their EP, Hard Times. The band played their record with 6-time Grammy Award winner Joey Williams of the Blind Boys of Alabama and Robert Randolph. Dale Krupla directed the video for Kristina, one of the records from the EP, shot in Phoenix and Brooklyn by Scott Irvine and Kim Menelt. Consequently, they landed the 4th spot on Billboard's Next Big Sound Chart.

Most of his works were rather small and many are miniatures. He focused on rural subjects. A number of his paintings are subtle political and social commentaries; notably those showing white and black men interacting as equals and friends. Biography His birthplace is in doubt, but was most likely Liverpool. By 1830, he was in the United States working as a lithographer; in New York and Philadelphia. He is known to have been a student at the National Academy of Design in 1833,Biographical notes @ the Oxford Index where he won several prizes. His early works display signs of classical, academic training and cover a wide variety of subjects. His later work shows the influence of William Sidney Mount. After 1834, he was a member of the National Academy and exhibited there until 1852. He also exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. In 1836, he married Margaret Mesier, the daughter of a former employer, and became a naturalized citizen in 1840. Biography @ the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum From that time, he focused on genre paintings, which were then just becoming popular. His first major work was originally called the \\"Fourth of July\\", but the title was changed to \\"Militia Training\\" after complaints that it depicted drunkenness and was not sufficiently dignified. He also exhibited regularly in New York, although he did not participate in the art community there; favoring smaller cities as his residence. This included Cooperstown (1852), Peekskill, and New Rochelle. His final home was in Binghamton, where he died. References Further reading * Lucretia H.

He worked on 105 films during his career, and was widely considered one of America's top fashion designers in the late 1930s. Early life and education Robert Mero Kalloch III was born January 13, 1893, in New York City to Dr. Robert Mero Kalloch II and his wife, Emily ( Maguire). His father was a dentistw of Scottish American descent. He attended New York City public schools, then spent four years at the Dwight School on Manhattan's Upper West Side. During his last three years at Dwight, he also attended and graduated from the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts. He later taught at the School of Fine and Applied Arts in his mid-20s, helping to educate Travis Banton and Adrian (both later Hollywood costume designers), and was a member of the jury in the school's 1918 costume design show. Although he won admission to Yale University, he never attended. Early career Upon graduation from the Dwight School, Kalloch joined Vogue as an illustrator and designer of women's fashions. At the age of 18, Kalloch sought out one of his idols, the prima ballerina Anna Pavlova. After weeks of haunting the performers' entrance at the theater where she was appearing, he finally convinced her to look at his sketches. She was so impressed that she hired him to design costumes for one of her ballets. He later designed costumes for the opera singer Mary Garden. In 1919, Kalloch won a position with Lucile Ltd., the fashion house of Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon. He worked in the London and Paris branches of the company, studying fashion and designing costumes for the Grande Revue of the Casino de Paris. Dancer Irene Castle was one of Lucile's clients, and Kalloch designed a number of her dance dresses. Castle swiftly became \\"the epitome of chic\\" to the public, and Kalloch was known as the \\"man who made the clothes that made Irene Castle famous\\". Returning to the United States in 1920, Kalloch took a job with Madame Frances & Co., where he co-designed fashions with Travis Banton. According to Edith Head, Kalloch and Banton's designs resembled one another, but Kalloch's work was more imaginative. By 1921, Kalloch was well known in New York City for designing costumes for the Ziegfeld Follies. He also designed costumes for Grace Moore's 1923 Broadway debut in Music Box Revue. In the five years he worked with Madame France & Co., Kalloch visited Europe 28 times to study fashion. Throughout the early and mid 1920s, he freelanced for Peggy Hamilton, a fashion designer who had worked as chief costume designer for Triangle Film Corporation. It is unclear what Kalloch's work history included between 1926 and 1930, although for at least a year he worked for fashion entrepreneur Hattie Carnegie. He came to the attention of Hollywood in the late 1920s when Peggy Hamilton, by then a Los Angeles Times fashion columnist began promoting his work in her articles. Hollywood Early work: 1933 to 1935 Claudette Colbert wearing a Kalloch-designed costume in It Happened One Night In 1933, Columbia Pictures hired Kalloch to be their chief fashion and women's costume designer. He was the first contract costume designer ever hired by the studio, and he established the studio's wardrobe department. Until his death, he was often credited by the mononym \\"Kalloch\\". Columbia Pictures at the time had a reputation as a Poverty Row B movie studio. Founder and president Harry Cohn was determined to change that, and in addition to hiring popular actresses like Nancy Carroll, Irene Dunne, Lillian Harvey, Grace Moore, and Fay Wray he hired top-flight technical talent like Kalloch. Kalloch's employment, in turn, convinced these leading actresses that Columbia Pictures intended to invest in their careers. Among his first works was a lace gown for Mary Brian in the 1933 film Fog and a gown with enormous draped sleeves for Glenda Farrell in Lady for a Day. He also designed the costumes for Elissa Landi for Excursion to Paradise (released under the title Sisters Under the Skin) and (with Edward Stevenson) for Barbara Stanwyck in The Bitter Tea of General Yen. He went to Paris in June 1934 to see the latest fashion trends, and by September of that year had designed costumes for Claudette Colbert (for It Happened One Night), Carole Lombard, Grace Moore, and Genevieve Tobin. After his return, he designed notable costumes for Ann Sothern in Eight Bells and a set of clothes for Joan Bennett in She Couldn't Take It which altered the actress' look from conservative to chic. Kalloch was Columbia Pictures' first good costume and fashion designer, Between 1930 and 1934, Columbia Pictures transforme itself from a Poverty Row studio to one of the eight major film studios during Hollywood's Golden Age. With Columbia's releases more than doubling from 21 to 47 a year, Kalloch was overwhelmed with work. In May 1935, Columbia Pictures hired Murray Mayer to lead its ladies' wardrobe department. Kalloch retained his position as the studio's fashion and costume designer. During this early period, Kalloch's work favored classic, graceful lines that treated actresses like sculpted marble. His work emphasized their height and slimness. Kalloch's mother died on June 29, 1935. Her death prompted Kalloch to leave Columbia and return to New York City, where he took a job once again with Madame Frances & Co. When Madame Frances retired in 1936, Kalloch returned to Columbia. Maturing work: 1936 to 1939 Irene Dunne in a Kalloch-designed evening dress and hat in The Awful Truth Over the next two years, Kalloch designed on-screen fashions for Ida Lupino in Weather or No (released as Let's Get Married), Irene Dunne in The Awful Truth, Madeleine Carroll in It's All Yours, and Mary Astor in No Time to Marry. Among his most innovative works during this time was a set of Persian cut cocktail pajamas for Grace Moore in I'll Take Romance. It started a brief fashion trend. During this period, Kalloch began to integrate low-cut décolletage and short bolero jackets into much of his work. He also became fascinated by the new colors the fabric, leather, and textile companies were creating and began using them in his designs. Late Columbia years: 1939 to 1941 Rosalind Russell in a Kalloch-designed dress and hat in His Girl Friday From 1939 to 1941, Kalloch designed notable on-screen fashions for Jean Arthur in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Only Angels Have Wings; Rosalind Russell in His Girl Friday; Rita Hayworth in The Lone Wolf Spy Hunt, Who Killed Gail Preston?, Only Angels Have Wings, Music in My Heart, and Angels Over Broadway; Loretta Young in The Doctor Takes a Wife; Penny Singleton in Blondie, Blondie Takes a Vacation, Blondie on a Budget, Blondie Has Servant Trouble, and Blondie Plays Cupid; Katharine Hepburn in Holiday; Joan Blondell in There's Always a Woman and Good Girls Go to Paris; and Barbara O'Neil and Wendy Barrie in I Am the Law. During this period, Kalloch continued to favor long, slim lines and form-fitting silhouettes. He preferred slim waists accented with a wide belt, and long skirts with long sleeves and a high collar. Only in 1939 for Good Girls Go to Paris did he shorten skirts to just below the knee. Among his most outstanding works between 1939 and 1941 was for Katharine Hepburn in 1938's Holiday. Kalloch began experimenting for the first time with odd jackets, using them to create new looks for classic outfits. He also designed a yellow chenille robe for her which was widely acclaimed. The media also paid particular attention to his work for Joan Blondell in 1938's There's Always a Woman, where Kalloch had to design a chic-looking wardrobe out of cheap garments and cloth. Another of his important works in this period was a red wool suit designed for Loretta Young in 1940's He Stayed for Breakfast.; Kalloch traveled to Europe to view fashions again in late 1939, returning to the United States in March 1940. MGM years: 1941 to 1943 Myrna Loy in a Kalloch-designed dress and hat from Shadow of the Thin Man Kalloch left Columbia Pictures in early 1941, and by May was working for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). The reason for his employment seems to be that his designs strongly resembled those of Adrian, MGM's chief fashion designer, with whom Kalloch had maintained a close friendship since Adrian's student days at the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts. Adrian then left the studio on September 5, 1941, to open his own fashion firm. During his short tenure at MGM, Kalloch designed costumes for Hedy Lamarr in H. M. Pulham, Esq., White Cargo, and Crossroads; Myrna Loy in Shadow of the Thin Man; Judy Garland in Babes on Broadway; Ann Sothern in Ringside Maisie and Maisie Gets Her Man; Eleanor Powell in I'll Take Manila (released under the title Ship Ahoy); Norma Shearer in We Were Dancing and Love Me Not (released under the title Her Cardboard Lover); Lana Turner in Somewhere I'll Find You; Veronica Lake in This Gun For Hire; Rosalind Russell in Design for Scandal;; 18 sparkling white gowns for Jeanette MacDonald in her first non-period piece film, Shadow of a Lady; (released under the title Cairo); and Greer Garson in Random Harvest and Mrs. Miniver; In an unusual endeavor, Kalloch also designed the drag costume for Mickey Rooney in 1941's Babes on Broadway. Among Kalloch's more important work in this period were the costumes he designed for Eleanor Powell in 1942's Ship Ahoy. Among these were 16 sheer dresses draped over crêpe tinted to look like a nude body. Another was a gown made of black marquisette, and which featured a high, round neckline; long, skintight gloves; and a pleated skirt over a slip dyed pale cocoa. He also designed a unique sarong of spun glass for her to wear in the film. Powell said she collaborated with Kalloch on her costumes in the film to ensure that the gowns both accommodated her dancing and moved and flowed well. For Norma Shearer in Her Cardboard Lover, Kalloch designed costumes which were the first indications of a new flowing, moving style in his work. One the most innovative gowns he designed for Shearer in this film became known as the \\"umbrella dress\\". Made of pink chiffon, it was embroidered with pearls, leaves, tendrils, with the yoke heavily encrusted with these items. Its \\"umbrella\\" shape was due to its circular shape, with a central hole for the neck and no sleeves. Kalloch also began to design shorter dresses. Although he actually lengthened Shearer's skirts in Her Cardboard Lover by several inches, he cut off Jeanette MacDonald's skirts in Cairo. The entry of the United States into World War II on December 7, 1941, led to heavy restrictions on the amount and kinds of fabric and other materials available to motion picture studios for use in costume design. Studios were also under pressure from the federal government to make films which exhibited confidence, energy, improvisation, movement, and spontaneity (all emotions which the government wanted the public to feel about the war effort). Kalloch began altering his design look and feel in early 1942 to reflect these needs. He largely abandoned elaborate, studied designs in favor of the chemise dress. Belts, pleats, and unique fastenings were no longer used. Skirts were fuller, but generally above the knees. Shoulders were broader and clothes could ripple, but swirling movement was no longer possible due to restrictions on the amount of fabric used. Crocheted hats and knitted scarves were now common (which indicated to the audience that these items were home-made rather than store- bought), and cords were used for draping but not as belts. Kalloch often was forced to improvise due to restrictions on materials. Because silk prints were not available, Kalloch produced appliqués in large batches and had them applied to plain silk. These proved so popular that Greer Garson, Hedy Lamarr, and Jeanette MacDonald all bought appliqué garments for their private wardrobes. He created what he called \\"body bandanas\\" for Lamarr's wardrobe in White Cargo—three sarongs which could be redraped or reversed in order to provide variety. A renewed focus on line helped reduced the need for trim, and he discovered that piping could substitute for a belt. Using these and other innovations, he saved of fabric, trim, several pounds of sequins, beads and spangles, and multiple yards of thread on Jeanette MacDonald's wardrobe in Cairo. After MGM Kalloch had been named Adrian's successor at MGM, but by late 1941 it was clear his design work and productivity were not acceptable to the studio. The reasons are unclear, but MGM head Louis B. Mayer may have been unhappy with his designs since Kalloch had no experience with period costumes. Columbia Pictures' Harry Cohn disliked this genre of film, and Kalloch had done no work in the genre prior to joining MGM. Kalloch may also have been suffering from personal problems, as his life-partner Joseph Demarais began to rapidly decline due to severe alcoholism. In June 1942, at the suggestion of Mayer's wife, Margaret, MGM hired Irene (Irene Lentz) as the studio's chief costume designer. Kalloch was retained as MGM's fashion designer. Kalloch's authority was further eroded when the studio hired Howard Shoup as a fashion designer in late July. Kalloch left MGM in 1943, although he continued to do freelance work for the studios until his death. His last major films were the 1946 film Suspense and the 1948 picture Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House (in which he dressed Myrna Loy again). He created wardrobes and women's fashions for 105 motion pictures. Kalloch was never nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design, as the category was only introduced in 1948. Other fashion work Peggy Hamilton often featured his work in her Los Angeles fashion shows in the 1930s, and Kalloch exhibited his film and private fashions at various shows. Film magazines regularly featured his work. Kalloch's fame as a costume and fashion designer was so great by 1937 that the press began to interview him with some frequency about fashion trends. He criticized \\"fussy\\" fashion, favored the swing skirt, supported the use of sheer fabrics for summer wear, offered advice to brides on a budget, and advocated slim lines and the use of suede. Beginning in 1938 and lasting two years, Kalloch wrote occasional fashion columns for the Los Angeles Times.; ; ; By 1940, Kalloch was considered one of the nation's top fashion designers and he was a member of the Los Angeles Fashion Group, a nonprofit organization of (largely female) fashion designers.; Throughout his Hollywood career, Kalloch continued to design fashions for the private use of a number of famous women, including Fay Wray,; Grace Moore,; Mona von Bismarck (wife of industrialist Harrison Williams), Joan Perry, Doris Nolan, Gloria Stuart, Ida Lupino, Loretta Young, and Rosalind Russell. He even designed a \\"strip tease dress\\" for Eleanor Powell for her 1942 USO tour. Her black evening dress was composed of several pieces, each of which was removed during the routine to reveal only a brief dance costume at the end. He also designed a 1937 line of hats for mass production, costumes for Nancy Carroll when she appeared in the play Jealousy in 1935, and (with Walter J. Israel) costumes for the San Francisco Light Opera Company's 1946 production of Jerome Kern's Roberta.; Personal life Kalloch had an unusually close relationship with his mother. She lived with her son in his New York City apartment after Kalloch's father died in 1915, and accompanied him to Europe in 1919 and 1920. He and his mother moved into an apartment at 1335 N. Laurel Avenue in Los Angeles in either late 1931 or January 1932. Kalloch and his mother collected antiques all over the world, and filled the apartment with them. Kalloch had found a black stray cat in Central Park in New York and named it Mimosa. In Los Angeles, Kalloch devoted an entire room of his apartment to the cat, covering the walls with chicken wire and growing ivy over it. Cushions were strewn on the floor for the cat's comfort. Kalloch was homosexual, and since at least 1931 was partnered with Joseph Demarais. Demarais' parents were French Canadian immigrants to the United States, and he grew up very poor in Tiverton, Rhode Island, the youngest of five children. In his teens, he worked in the local textile factory before relocating to New York City to become an artist. By the late 1920s, Demarais was sharing an apartment with other struggling artists. It is unclear when Kalloch and Demarais met, although there is evidence to suggest that they both worked for Madame Frances & Co. Demarais relocated to Los Angeles in February 1932 to be with Kalloch. In 1939, Kalloch and Demarais jointly purchased a home at 4329 Agnes Avenue in the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles for $10,000 ($ in dollars). The two decorated the house with antiques and paintings. After his move to MGM, Kalloch put Demarais on the studio's payroll as his own secretary at a salary of $950 ($ in dollars) a year. Demarais, an alcoholic, entered a residential sanatorium for alcoholics for the first time in 1941. His stay was brief, but he returned to the facility numerous times over the next five years. During this period, Kalloch's professional output declined dramatically. Kalloch wore round wire-frame glasses and was never without his silver cigarette case. He was a good cook, often experimenting in the kitchen. He reportedly suffered from a number of phobias and neuroses, the most famous of which was his fear of automobiles. He refused to own a car of his own, and when forced to ride in a car would cower on the floor of the back seat. Death Kalloch suffered from arteriosclerosis, and died of cardiac arrest at about 6:00 AM at his home on October 19, 1947. His lover, Joseph Demarais, died of alcoholic fatty liver disease at 3:15 PM the same day. With Demarais' death coming so soon after Kalloch's, a suspicion of foul play arose. Autopsies on both men confirmed a natural cause of death in both instances. He was interred at Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. Travis Banton paid for half of Kalloch's burial and funeral expenses. Kalloch's will designated Demarais as his heir. Demarais' will, in turn, designated Kalloch as his heir. Demarais inherited Kalloch's $5,000 ($ in dollars) estate. But because Demarais' will was inoperative, his estate (valued at $20,000 [$ in dollars]) and Kalloch's went to Demarai's two brothers. Kalloch's uncle and aunt sued to overturn Kalloch's will. The court battle, which was ultimately resolved in favor of the Demarais heirs, lasted four years. Kalloch's relations settled the lawsuit for $750 ($ in dollars), while Demarais' siblings received the remaining $10,000 ($ in dollars).

The Shepard elephant, also known as L'egs-istential Quandary or the impossible elephant is an optical illusion, of the type impossible object, based on figure-ground confusion. As its creator Roger Shepard explains: > The elephant…belongs to a class of objects that are truly impossible in that > the object itself cannot be globally segregated from the nonobject or > background. Parts of the object (in this case the elephant’s legs) become > the background, and vice versa. History Shepard first published this optical paradox in his 1990 book Mind Sights (page 79) giving it the name \\"L'egs-istential Quandary.\\" It is the first entry in his chapter on \\"Figure-ground impossibilities.\\" The pen-and-ink drawing is based on a dream Shepard had in 1974, and on the pencil sketch he made when he woke up. Interpretation Blivet illusion, another impossible figure based on figure-ground confusion The image is widely reproduced and discussed. Brad Honeycutt, author of Exceptional Eye Tricks, calls the Shepard elephant \\"one of the most famous and classic optical illusions.\\" The MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences classifies it under \\"Illusions of Interpretation\\" as an example of \\"Impossible Pictures\\", saying, \\"Impossible figures embody conflicting 3D clues...Shepard's elephant (figure 2) confuses its legs with the spaces in between. Local votes about depth are not properly integrated.\\" The Oxford Companion to Consciousness suggests as a way to understand \\"Shepard’s many-legged elephant\\": \\"try slowly uncovering the elephant from the top, or from the bottom.\\" (If you cover the bottom of the drawing, you see the top of an elephant with four legs. If you cover the drawing's top, you see four elephant feet, plus trunk and tail.) Al Seckel, who devotes Chapter 18 of his book Masters of Deception to Roger Shepard, draws a contrast between Shepard's elephant and the impossible trident (aka the \\"blivet\\" or \\"Devil's tuning fork\\"). Although an impossible trident has a closed edge, Seckel says the \\"conspicuous line discontinuity\\" of the elephant's tail is necessary to avoid a \\"counting paradox\\": a blivet is an imaginary object, but everyone knows an elephant has exactly four legs and exactly four feet. Influence Derivative version of Shepard elephant (4 legs, 5 feet) The Shepard elephant has attracted interest outside scholarly sources. Author Clive Gifford included it in his 2013 book for children Eye Benders, and told The Guardian it is one of his favorites. Sometime before 2012, someone created a modified version of the Shepard elephant. The modified elephant has an extra hind leg, with foot attached, made by extending the curved line that Shepard left ambiguous (to look like either the top of a leg or the end of a tail.) This modified image, which now has four legs but five feet, was circulated as \\"How many legs does this elephant have?\\" The Shepard elephant has also inspired some other derivative works. Dutch psychologist Hugo Schouppe made a video, showing how GIMP can be used to reverse-engineer the elephant illusion, moving its feet so that each one connects to a leg. The OpticalSpy website also cited the Shepard elephant as inspiration for manipulating a photograph of an Indian elephant to give it six legs. See also *M. C.

The first version of HEAAN was published on GitHub on 15 May 2016, and later a new version of HEAAN with a bootstrapping algorithmJung Hee Cheon, Kyoohyung Han, Andrey Kim, Miran Kim and Yongsoo Song. Bootstrapping for Approximate Homomorphic Encryption. In EUROCRYPT 2018(springer). was released. Currently, the latest version is Version 2.1. CKKS plaintext space Unlikely to the other HE scheme, the CKKS scheme supports approximate arithmetics over complex numbers (hence, real numbers). More precisely, the plaintext space of the CKKS scheme is \\\\mathbb{C}^{n/2} for some power-of-two integer n . To deal with the complex plaintext vector efficiently, Cheon et al. proposed plaintext encoding/decoding methods which exploits a ring isomorphism \\\\phi: \\\\mathbb{R}[X]/(X^n+1) \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C}^{n/2} . Encoding method Given a plaintext vector \\\\vec z = (z_1,z_2,...,z_{n/2}) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}^{n/2} and a scaling factor \\\\Delta > 1 , the plaintext vector is encoded as a polynomial m(X) \\\\in R:= \\\\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^n+1) by computing m(X) = \\\\lfloor \\\\Delta \\\\cdot \\\\phi^{-1}(\\\\vec z) \\\\rceil \\\\in R where \\\\lfloor \\\\cdot \\\\rceil denotes the coefficient-wise rounding function. Decoding method Given a message polynomial m(X) \\\\in R and a scaling factor \\\\Delta > 1 , the message polynomial is decoded to a complex vector \\\\vec z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}^{n/2} by computing \\\\vec z = \\\\Delta^{-1}\\\\cdot \\\\phi(m(X)) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}^{n/2}. Here the scaling factor \\\\Delta > 1 enables us to control the encoding/decoding error which is occurred by the rounding process. Namely, one can obtain the approximate equation \\\\text{Dcd}(\\\\text{Ecd}(\\\\vec z; \\\\Delta); \\\\Delta) \\\\approx \\\\vec z by controlling \\\\Delta where \\\\text{Ecd} and \\\\text{Dcd} denote the encoding and decoding algorithm, respectively. From the ring-isomorphic property of the mapping \\\\phi: \\\\mathbb{R}[X]/(X^n+1) \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C}^{n/2} , for m_1 = \\\\text{Ecd}(\\\\vec z_1;\\\\Delta) and m_2 = \\\\text{Ecd}(\\\\vec z_2;\\\\Delta) , the following hold: * \\\\text{Dcd}(m_1 + m_2;\\\\Delta) \\\\approx \\\\vec z_1 + \\\\vec z_2 , * \\\\text{Dcd}(m_1\\\\cdot m_2;\\\\Delta) \\\\approx \\\\vec z_1 \\\\circ \\\\vec z_2 , where \\\\circ denotes the Hadamard product of the same-length vectors. These properties guarantee the approximate correctness of the computations in the encoded state when the scaling factor \\\\Delta is chosen appropriately. Algorithms The CKKS scheme basically consists of those algorithms: key Generation, encryption, decryption, homomorphic addition and multiplication, and rescaling. For a positive integer q, let R_q := R/qR be the quotient ring of R modulo q. Let \\\\chi_s, \\\\chi_r and \\\\chi_e be distributions over R which output polynomials with small coefficients. These distributions, the initial modulus Q , and the ring dimension n are predetermined before the key generation phase. Key generation The key generation algorithm is following: * Sample a secret polynomial s \\\\leftarrow \\\\chi_s . * Sample a (resp. a' ) uniform randomly from R_Q (resp. R_{PQ} ), and e,e' \\\\leftarrow \\\\chi_e . * Output a secret key sk \\\\leftarrow (1, s)\\\\in R_Q^2 , a public key pk \\\\leftarrow (b = -a \\\\cdot s + e, a) \\\\in R_Q^2 , and an evaluation key evk \\\\leftarrow (b' = -a' \\\\cdot s + e' + P\\\\cdot s^2, a') \\\\in R_{PQ}^2. Encryption The encryption algorithm is following: * Sample an ephemeral secret polynomial r \\\\leftarrow \\\\chi_r . * For a given message polynomial m \\\\in R , output a ciphertext ct \\\\leftarrow (c_0 = r\\\\cdot b + e_0 + m, c_1 = r\\\\cdot a + e_1) \\\\in R_Q^2 . Decryption The decryption algorithm is following: * For a given ciphertext ct \\\\in R_q^2 , output a message m' \\\\leftarrow \\\\langle ct, sk \\\\rangle (\\\\text{mod } q) . The decryption outputs an approximate value of the original message, i.e., \\\\text{Dec}(sk, \\\\text{Enc}(pk, m)) \\\\approx m, and the approximation error is determined by the choice of distributions \\\\chi_s, \\\\chi_e, \\\\chi_r . When considering homomorphic operations, the evaluation errors are also included in the approximation error. Basic homomorphic operations, addition and multiplication, are done as follows. Homomorphic addition The homomorphic addition algorithm is following: * Given two ciphertexts ct and ct' in R_q^2, output ct_{\\\\text{add}} \\\\leftarrow ct + ct' \\\\in R_q^2. The correctness holds as \\\\text{Dec}(sk, ct_\\\\text{add}) \\\\approx \\\\text{Dec}(sk, ct) + \\\\text{Dec}(sk, ct') . Homomorphic multiplication The homomorphic multiplication algorithm is following: * Given two ciphertext ct =(c_0, c_1) and ct' =(c_0', c_1') in R_q^2, compute (d_0, d_1, d_2) = (c_0c_0', c_0c_1'+c_1c_0', c_1c_1') (\\\\text{mod } q). Output ct_{\\\\text{mult}} \\\\leftarrow (d_0, d_1) + \\\\lfloor P^{-1}\\\\cdot d_2 \\\\cdot evk \\\\rceil \\\\in R_q^2. The correctness holds as \\\\text{Dec}(sk, ct_\\\\text{mult}) \\\\approx \\\\text{Dec}(sk, ct) \\\\cdot \\\\text{Dec}(sk, ct') . Note that the approximation error (on the message) exponentially grows up on the number of homomorphic multiplications. To overcome this problem, most of HE schemes usually use a modulus-switching technique which was introduced by Brakerski, Gentry and Vaikuntanathan.Z. Brakerski, C. Gentry, and V. Vaikuntanathan. Fully Homomorphic Encryption without Bootstrapping. In ITCS 2012 In case of HEAAN, the modulus-switching procedure is called rescaling. The Rescaling algorithm is very simple compared to Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanatahn's original algorithm. Applying the rescaling algorithm after a homomomorphic multiplication, the approximation error grows linearly, not exponentially. Rescaling The rescaling algorithm is following: * Given a ciphertext ct \\\\in R_q^2 and a new modulus q' < q, output a rescaled ciphertext ct_{\\\\text{rs}}\\\\leftarrow \\\\lfloor (q'/q)\\\\cdot ct\\\\rceil \\\\in R_{q'}^2. The total procedure of the CKKS scheme is as following: Each plaintext vector \\\\vec z which consists of complex (or real) numbers is firstly encoded as a polynomial m(X) \\\\in R by the encoding method, and then encrypted as a ciphertext ct \\\\in R_q^2 . After several homomorphic operations, the resulting ciphertext is decrypted as a polynomial m'(X) \\\\in R and then decoded as a plaintext vector \\\\vec z' which is the final output.  Security  The IND-CPA security of the CKKS scheme is based on the hardness assumption of the ring learning with errors (RLWE) problem, the ring variant of very promising lattice-based hard problem Learning with errors (LWE). Currently the best known attacks for RLWE over a power-of-two cyclotomic ring are general LWE attacks such as dual attack and primal attack. The bit security of the CKKS scheme based on known attacks was estimated by Albrecht's LWE estimator. Martin Albrecht. Security Estimates for the Learning with Errors Problem, https://bitbucket.org/malb/lwe-estimator  Library  Version 1.0, 1.1 and 2.1 have been released so far. Version 1.0 is the first implementation of the CKKS scheme without bootstrapping. In the second version, the bootstrapping algorithm was attached so that users are able to address large-scale homomorphic computations. In Version 2.1, currently the latest version, the multiplication of ring elements in R_q was accelerated by utilizing fast Fourier transform (FFT)-optimized number theoretic transform (NTT) implementation.

History  The first church, built in 1854, was replaced in 1874 by the existing structure. Half an acre of land () in East Melbourne was granted on 19 January 1853 for construction of a church. Donations, a government grant and a bank loan covered the cost; the foundation stone was laid on 27 September 1853 and the dedication of the completed church occurred on 11 June 1854. Additional land was granted in February 1855 for the manse. From 1870, discussions occurred concerning enlargement of the church and repairs that were required. The sale of some land allowed the construction of a new church; its foundation stone was laid on 17 March 1874 and the completed church was dedicated on 22 November 1874. Architect John Koch, a member of the Trinity Church Committee, started preparing plans for the second church but another architect, Carl Blackmann, offered his services free of charge. Blackmann, also known as Charles Blachmann, sent plans which were accepted. Koch later designed the manse which was built in 1890. Matthias Goethe was appointed as the church's first pastor on 25 March 1853. Goethe was succeeded by Hermann Herlitz who was the pastor from 1868 to 1914.  Description  The church is built of bluestone with a pitched slate roof. The building follows a basilica design. The church exterior is with an interior height to the apex of the ceiling of . The church was intended to hold from 370 to 500 people. Internally, each side of the church has five pointed and moulded arches which separate the aisle from the nave. The arches are supported by columns with foliated capitals.  Heritage listing  The church, hall, manse, fencing and land were added to the Victorian Heritage Register on 9 October 1974. The heritage statement of significance mentions that the congregation has occupied the site continuously since 1853, and that services have always been conducted in German. As of 2019, an English-language service is held every fourth Sunday, with German- language services on other Sundays. The architecturally important bluestone church shows a rich interior decoration, with a timber ceiling and stained glass by Ferguson and Urie. A pipe organ was dedicated on 16 May 1875. The church heritage listing states that the organ is significant for having been built by Robert Mackenzie and, while having been rebuilt twice, for retaining the original pipework and case.

It is based on a scene from William Shakespeare's Measure for Measure. In this scene, Isabella is made to choose between sacrificing her brother's life or sacrificing her virginity to Angelo. Hunt's image attempts to depict the characters' tangible emotions in the moment that this choice must be made. Hunt summarized the moral as: ‘Thou shall not do evil that good may come.’ Isabella's purity is reflected by her upright position, her plain white habit, and the sun shining on her through the window, out of which a church can be seen in the distance. Her brother Claudio, shackled to the wall, clearly uncomfortable in both mind and body. He is turned away from his sister, ashamed of the circumstances that brought them here and confronted with the fear of his own imminent death.

This initiative was taken by the Government of India to prevent women from being harassed and mistreated while commuting in rickshaws. Special features like panic buttons and GPS tracking systems are installed for the safety of women. Pink rickshaws are either fully pink rickshaws or their rooftop is pink colored. pink rickshaws were first launched 2013 in Ranchi by the government of India to protect women against sexual assaults and rapes. Eventually it was introduced in many other cities in India. The autos are driven by the trained professionals, either men or women, after completion of legal verification and documentation.  Women's empowerment  The pink rickshaw scheme was initiated by the Ranchi government for improving the condition of women. By providing women safe transportation, the Ranchi government is empowering women, enabling them to work and be self sufficient. Traditionally in India, men are the wage earners. Safe transportation enables women to become independent and contribute to the family income.  Pink rickshaw operation by location   Ranchi  Ranchi was the first city in India to launch the pink rickshaw scheme. It was launched in 2013 for the safety of women after the 2012 Delhi gang rape. Jharkhand Police introduced around 200 pink roofed rickshaws in capital Ranchi for transportation of women passengers. These autos had special features such as panic button and GPS system for the safety of women passengers. Police tried to appoint female drivers for these rickshaws, but due to less response by females they appointed male drivers. All the male drivers were verified through standard procedures set by the government authorities. Only those who cleared were given special identity cards and were allowed to ferry women. But this service is no longer available for women passengers only because drivers have to wait a long duration to get female passengers, due to which drivers started ferrying male passengers too in pink autos in order to make more trips in less time. Jharkhand High Court ordered the Regional Transport Authority to get rid of all autos in the city without legal permits. Out of total 12,000 rickshaws in Ranchi, only 2,335 autos had legal permits. Out of those 2,335 autos, no pink rickshaw had the legal permit to operate. Due to the suspension of trade permits, pink rickshaw drivers went on a strike demanding the issuance of lifetime legal permits to ply the trade.  Surat  Surat Municipal Corporation launched pink auto on 2 July 2017. The corporation selected and trained women to drive automobiles as it is a service for women by women. SMC helped these women to get loans at a 7% interest rate with a benefit of 25% subsidy by Central Government to procure the rickshaw. The Municipal Corporation identified 70 women in which 15 were trained and others were under training. They have concentrated on girl's school areas for ferrying school children in the daytime.  Bongaigaon  Bongaigaon is one of the biggest commercial and industrial hubs of Assam. The National Urban Livelihood Mission (NULM) launched pink rickshaws driven by women, for the safety of women while commuting. Before women got licensed, they were trained by Dispur motor driving school for two months. There were a total of 13 rickshaws in the city providing the service from 6 am to 6 pm. Odisha Pink Auto Rickshaw project was launched in Bhubaneswar (capital of Odisha) on 27 June 2015 by Chief Minister of Odisha. It was introduced by the Commissioner of Odisha police to enlighten their 'We care motto' for women. The autos will be driven by men, but only those men will drive who stand to set standards by the government and will be trained to take care of female passengers in any situation. The auto is mainly for women and children to promote the safety of women commuters in city. Within a year of launch there were 353 pink autos operating in Bhubaneswar in all parts including isolated areas with a positive feedback by the women travelers. Eventually, it was also launched in Rourkela in Odisha.  Gurgaon  In 2010, for the first time pink rickshaws were launched in Gurgaon after several women were sexually assaulted by taxi drivers. Pink rickshaws did not receive a positive response from commuters at that time, which led to failure in sustaining the programme, which was soon suspended in Gurgaon. In January 2013 pink autos were relaunched in Gurgaon by the Gurgaon Traffic Police. The decision was made due to a rape case by an Uber taxi driver and at the same time a horrific gang rape case of a paramedical student by six men in a bus in Delhi in December, 2012. This time, rickshaws were designed by keeping in mind special safety measures like panic buttons and a GPS system. The government even created an auto stand specifically for Pink Autos at MG Road Metro Station. There were 22 rickshaws launched at this time. Within a month and a half they failed to function in the city and faced a shutdown again. One of the major reasons behind the shutdown was increasing popularity of online cab services available in the city. The Deputy Commissioner of Traffic Police said that they launched rickshaws but they do not have to play any role in implementation as it depends on the market forces and how people accept it. After facing two failures, in 2015 pink rickshaw service was relaunched with total of 61 rickshaws. The initiative was taken to reduce the number of cases of sexual harassment in the city.

It introduced a typology of modern yoga including modern postural yoga. Context Yoga became widespread in the Western world in the late 20th century, but received little academic attention until the 21st century, broadly starting with Elizabeth De Michelis's book, based on her doctoral thesis. It encouraged other scholars, including De Michelis's pupil Mark Singleton in his 2010 book Yoga Body, to investigate the origins of the modern, global, yoga phenomenon. Elizabeth De Michelis is a scholar of religion specialising in the history of modern yoga. Book Contents The book is in two parts, first a \\"prehistory\\" of modern yoga, and then an account of what De Michelis means by modern yoga, distinguishing subtypes \\"Modern Psychosomatic Yoga\\" (as in Sivananda Yoga), \\"Modern Postural Yoga\\" (as in Iyengar yoga, Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, and many other schools) and \\"Modern Meditational Yoga\\" (as in Transcendental Meditation). The book is illustrated with 14 monochrome photographs including three of Keshubchandra Sen, four of Vivekananda and his book, and four from pages of B. K. S. Iyengar's books. Reception De Michelis argued that modern global yoga has its roots in Vivekananda's Raja Yoga adaptation of yoga for a Western audience. Harold Coward, reviewing the book in Journal of Hindu- Christian Studies, notes that De Michelis distinguishes between Patanjali's account of yoga in his classical Yoga Sutras and Vivekananda's personal reinterpretation of yoga for the modern world in his 1896 Raja Yoga. Elephant Journal notes that the well-researched book sets modern yoga in its cultural context, but that it \\"then leaps forward\\" from Vivekananda at the end of the 19th century to Iyengar in the mid-20th. Suzanne Newcombe, in the Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Religion, notes that the book started the academic focus on contemporary yoga with its definition and analysis of \\"modern yoga\\". Albertina Nugteren, reviewing the book in Aries, notes that it promises to provide a historical overview of the transformation of yoga when it crossed the cultural boundary from India to the West, but that \\"the story cannot be told in full, and [the] author has to make choices.\\" As a result, the book is more of a \\"preliminary overview\\", but it does three useful things: it links modern yoga's birth to Vivekananda's 1896 Raja Yoga; it provides a workable typology of modern yoga; and it presents one example, Iyengar yoga, in detail. In Nugteren's view, modern postural yoga, \\"so important in the context of contemporary society's stress on fitness and a perfect body\\", differs in emphasis from traditional yoga \\"in India and elsewhere\\" but \\"is not divorced from\\" its spiritual and ethical values. Lola Williamson, reviewing the book in Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review, calls it \\"a comprehensive overview\\" that traces modern yoga's foundations in 19th century esoteric systems from East and West and a mix of early 20th century ideas such as New thought, mesmerism, Neo-Vedanta and Raja Yoga, all the way to the globalisation of yoga.

The model was first announced in December 2017 and unveiled to the public in May 2018 at the Beijing Auto Show. Mass production of the EX5 began in September 2018. Overview WM Motor EX5 rear The WM Motor EX5 production version made its debut at the 2018 Beijing Auto Show. The price of the EX5 ranges from CNY￥139,800 (~US$20,000) to CNY￥189,800 (~US$27,100), inclusive of Chinese government electric vehicle subsidies. There are three variants of the EX5, the EX5 400 Mate, EX5 400 and EX5 520. The EX5 400 Mate and EX5 400 are both equipped with a 52.5 kWh battery that provides 400 kilometers NEDC range. The EX5 520 is equipped with a 69kWh battery and achieves 520 kilometers NEDC range. In all EX5 variants, WM Motor uses electric drive modules supplied by BorgWarner that can provide up to of torque. WM Motor supplies a 6.6 kW, 220V home charger that can fully charge the EX5 in 8.5 to 9 hours. Charging from 30% to 80% takes 30 minutes when using 120 kW DC fast chargers. The EX5 is built around three core technologies – the 'Living Motion' electric powertrain, the 'Living Pilot' intelligent driving assistance system, with L2 ADAS autonomous driving features, as well as the 'Living Engine' operating system, which offers smart connectivity and interactive features in the cabin. On 28 September 2018, one year from the start of the production of the EX5, the company announced that it had delivered over 16,000 EX5s, with the model maintaining a customer satisfaction score of 97%. Core Technology  Living Pilot – Driving assistance and autonomous driving features  Since Q2 2019, the EX5 can be equipped with a full suite of Bosch L2 ADAS features, making the EX5 the first model in its category that delivers the full suite of L2 ADAS features. The Living Pilot L2 ADAS features are enabled through one high-definition front camera, three medium distance millimeter wave radars, a 360-degree camera system consisting of 4 cameras mounted around the vehicle, and 12 ultrasonic radar sensors. In January, 2019, WM Motor announced a long-term strategic partnership with Baidu to jointly develop L3 and L4 autonomous driving technologies, and establish the 'WM Motor & Baidu Apollo Intelligent Vehicle Joint Research Center'.  Living Engine - Smart Connectivity and Interactive Features  WM Motor's Living Engine is powered by the company's own operating system, which integrates software applications and technologies. The Living Engine consists of proprietary features as well as third-party applications developed by WM Motor's partners including Tencent (QQ Music for music streaming; WeChat for instant messaging), Baidu (Baidu Maps for navigation), iQiyi (video streaming platform) as well as Xiaomi and Gree Electric (smart home appliances). Through the use of facial recognition technology, Living Engine can automatically consolidate the driver's online music and video streaming and social media accounts to the vehicle. Living Engine deploys a 12.8 inch rotating touch screen display which functions as the main user interface for the infotainment and environmental control systems as well as a 12.3 inch interactive LCD instrument display. Living Engine is also integrated with an onboard virtual assistant, 'Xiaowei' (Chinese: 小威)that uses voice recognition technology to respond to commands from the driver and passengers.  Living Motion - E-Powertrain  WM Motor's Living Motion E-powertrain consists of an electric drive module, battery pack and electronic control insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT). Living Motion uses components from suppliers including BorgWarner (electric drive module), Infineon (electronic control IGBT), as well as CATL (宁德时代), Tianjin Lishen (天津力神) and Tafel (塔菲尔新能源科技) (lithium-ion battery cells and modules). The battery pack is fitted with WM Motor's own BMS that monitors and maintains battery cell temperatures in climate conditions ranging from -30 °C (-22°F) to 50 °C (122°F). The BMS helps to stabilise energy output and maintain the EX5's driving range between charges and over the lifetime of the vehicle. The BMS also helps to prevent battery degradation, with the EX5 having been shown to experience only 5% degradation after 160,000 km (~100,000 mi) of real world driving.  Safety  In July 2019, the EX5 was certified with C-NCAP 5-star safety rating.  Battery  The EX5's battery pack is positioned at the center of the car and has an ingress protection rating of IP67, meaning that the battery is 100% protected against dust, sand and other outside elements. L2 ADAS WM Motor has, together with its partners, developed an intelligent driving assistance system for the EX5 that incorporates a range of safety features, including Adaptive Cruise Control (ACCA), Intersection Collision Avoidance (ICA), Traffic Jam Assist (TJA) and Automatic Parking Assist (APA), as well as eight further security features. WM Motor releases quarterly OTA updates aimed at improving its L2 systems.  Distribution  WM Motor has been quickly rolling out its retail distribution channel which, at the end of June this year, consisted of 59 open retail locations and 96 signed Smart Mobility Partners (or \\"SMPs) in 63 major cities across China. WM Motor's SMP base has since spread across more regions in China.

Shivajith Padmanabhan, Samyuktha Menon and Vini Vishwa Lal play the negative roles. Prologue In the prologue session of the film, we can see a scene from K's past which is not shown in the film. In a gang territory, one member reports something to the other goons and they are shown running outside to confront someone. Then K comes in the picture who was standing turned away from them. A goon is also shown lying on the ground after being beaten severely in the hands of K. Here K is completely different from as shown in the film. He is having a long beard and some different clothes. Blood is pouring from his face which indicates that a huge fight had taken place. Seeing the lying goon, the whole gang started running towards K to attack him. When they reach near, K suddenly turns around and uses his iron box to hit a goon in the head. Then the scene suddenly ends abruptly. This scene was released as a Prologue Teaser for the promotion of the film. Plot Nanchenkotta is a fictional place in Kerala-Tamil Nadu border which is ruled and owned by a party named DYP whose leader was Amarnath(Shivajith Padmanabhan). The party threatens and tortures the people there to keep them under their control and everyone lives in fear. Therefore, many residents left the land and are living in neighboring places. So that place was now filled with goons under the command of Amarnath. The party also had businesses there like gun production. The other known members of the party were Amarnath's brother Appu(Vini Vishwa Lal) and their cousin Dr. Sangeetha(Samyuktha Menon). There was another rival party lead by Adv. Lakshmanan who also used to participate in election failed due to the influence of Amarnath. The movie begins with a public address session by Adv. Lakshmanan who speaks in favor of the locals and against DYP and asks for the vote of the local people. After the speech Lakshmanan was killed by Amarnath's main goon Ummar(Harish Uthaman). The present SI of Nanchenkotta at that time was SI Vysakhan. Even though there was a police station and in Nanchenkotta, the law was in the hands of Amarnath alone and the police were under their control and therefore was unable to take any action against him. After his daughter criticises him for not taking any action in the murder case of her friend's father and after thinking about his inability, Vyshakan was heartbroken and thus committed suicide. Meanwhile, the new leader of the rival party along with his subordinates starts taking their own decisions without thinking about the people. They conduct a meeting to select the candidate for the upcoming election (against Appu who is DYP's candidate). There the new decisions were not welcomed well and as a senior party member named Sooraj(Saiju Kurup) and several other members leave the party to work for the people on their own. The same day, the new leader lends a goon out of town to murder Amarnath but he ends up dying by Amarnath's hands. This was the time when a new nameless SI (Tovino Thomas) (simply referred to as \\"K\\") arrives at Nanchenkotta. He is completely different from the previous SI. On his arrival, he burns a goon alive who had taken over the Police Station. After this, he along with other policeman started clearing the city from Amarnath's goons even by using illegal methods such as rolling. Due to the fear of the SI many change their paths. Later he visited the gun manufacturing site owned by Amarnath and orders Appu to stop this activity. In response, Ummar arrives at the Police Station and threatens K only to get beaten up by him and K orders him not to work under Amarnath from this day onwards. Under the command of Amarnath, Ummar does various activities to make K leave the town or kill him but fails. In a final attempt, he attacks two of the policemen and one loses his leg in the process. An agitated K tracks down Ummar in a factory and beats him and his allies severely and finally sewers off both his legs with a chainsaw along with his crew. Sooraj meets K and tells him about the people who have left the place,the problems and requests his help in returning the people back. So he starts working for the people against DYP which angers Amarnath more. Amarnath's goons kill a policeman in response and stabs K badly with knives,but K manages to defeat them all. In the next step,Amarnath murders Sooraj which pulls down the confidence of the locals. Angered K kidnaps Appu and beats him badly. Amarnath is forced to kill Appu to end his suffering. After Appu's death,Sangeetha becomes the candidate but leaves to Hyderabad after a policeman threatens her. Having lost his brother Amarnath vows to kill K himself and asks him to come out for a final battle. In the subsequent fight Amarnath overpowers K at times but K gets the last laugh and victory. K drags the body of Amarnath through the streets as the people who had left arrives and takes care of the remaining goons themselves, thus establishing peace in Nanchenkotta. As his work in Nanchenkotta is over, K leaves the place unnoticed. A few months later, in an unknown place in Tamil Nadu, a goon threatens the locals. Suddenly, he is hit by a Jeep. Inside the Jeep was seen K, in his new get-up who had arrived to restore peace at that place too.

The Lepke provided solo experience of the techniques learned with an instructor in an aircraft with similar handling characteristics. That done, the Lepke could be used as a standard trainer to take its pilot to C-certificate level. The pair were widely used by Hungarian glider clubs post-war, with sixty-five of each produced. Design and development In 1940 Ernő Rubik began to consider a glider flight training programme based on a pair of aircraft with similar flight characteristics and sharing many components but differing in their seating. Students would begin on the R-15 Koma, with side-by-side seating and the reassurance and guidance of a tutor watching, then go solo on the R-16 Lepke. During the war, the Hungarian National Aviation Association (Országos Magyar Repülö Egyesület or OMRE) chose to use his R-11 Cimbora and the Koma and Lepke designs were shelved until, in 1948, OMRE announced a competition for single seat and two seat trainers. By the end of the year Rubik's two designs had been chosen. The prototype Koma first flew in the spring of 1949, followed by the Lepke in the summer. The Lapke was a pod-and-boom glider with a high wing mounted over the front end of the boom and braced with inverted-V struts from the lower fuselage to the spar. The wing was rectangular in plan out to rounded tips and had 3° of dihedral. It was built around a single, wooden spar with wooden ribs; ply covering ahead of the spar formed a torsion-resistant D-box. The rest of the wing was fabric-covered. Diagonal drag struts near the root were made from steel tubes. Constant chord Handley Page slotted ailerons filled the outer half-spans, as on the Koma, but the high-wing Lepka did not need the Koma's flaps. Its wingspan was less than that of the heavier Koma. As on the Koma, the wings could be folded back alongside the fuselage once the horizontal tail had been folded upwards. The forward pod was built around a box-section beam which projected forward to the nose, together with a frame and longerons . The beam carried the single seat in an open cockpit, locally ply-covered and with a removable ply cover fitted with a windshield, around the pilot. Elsewhere the pod was fabric-covered. From the aft of the beam a metal tube strut reached upwards and rearwards to support the boom that formed the rear fuselage. This tube, which was more steeply angled than on the 13% longer Koma, gave the pod a more abrupt rear end. The end of the fuselage beam also mounted an exposed monowheel, assisted by a short, rubber sprung landing skid ahead of it. The tailboom was a horizontal, rectangular section, wooden, ply-covered structure mounted under the centre of the wing spar and braced with wires from mid-span to the tail as well as the steel tube. The Lepke had a conventional tail with a narrow, vertically edged fin. Compared with the Koma, fin area was reduced but the roughly triangular rudder was similar. Its strut-braced horizontal tail was rectangular with rounded tips and of higher aspect ratio than the Koma. The fixed surfaces were wooden but control surfaces were light-metal structures with fabric covering. The prototype R-16 Lepke first flew at Esztergom in the summer of 1949. A series of sixty-five slightly modified R-16bs followed over 1952-3 and these became the standard Hungarian single-seat trainer; once launching was mastered, pilots continued in the Lepke to their C certificates. The Lepkes were retired in the 1960s, after ten years of use.

Background Whittaker was born in Crookwell, New South Wales, Australia Playing career Whittaker made his first grade debut for Balmain in Round 6 1979 against Newtown at Henson Park. Over the following 7 seasons, Whittaker became the club's first choice hooker and captained the side. Towards the end of his playing career, Whittaker mainly played from the bench after the emergence of Benny Elias. Whittaker retired from playing at the end of 1985. Post playing In 1994, Whittaker became chairman of Balmain and was one of the backers behind the club changing its name and location to become more marketable. It was decided in 1995 that Balmain would change their name to the \\"Sydney Tigers\\" and play their home games at Parramatta Stadium. The move started in the same year that the Super League war had begun. By the end of 1996, Balmain reverted to their original name and returned to playing at Leichhardt Oval for the 1997 season as the \\"Sydney Tigers\\" experiment was deemed a failure. In February 1997, Whittaker was appointed John Quayle's successor as Chief Executive of the NSWRL.

Coat of arms of the Russian comital Toll family of 1829, in the Baltic Coat of arms by Carl Arvid Klingspor in 1882. Toll was a Baltic German noble family of possible Hollandish origin. According to legend, the family's name originated from a castle near Leiden. The family held Swedish and Russian baronial and comital titles, Austrian baronial titles, Prussian, Oldenburgish, Finnish untitled noble status and also possibly belonged to Dutch nobility.  History  St. Mary's Cathedral in Tallinn, 2014. A memorial stone to Eduard von Toll in the cemetery of the former family estate in Kukruse. The origin of the Toll family was debated among genealogists and historians. According to the Genealogical Handbook of the Baltic Knighthoods, Part Estonia by Baron Otto Magnus von Stackelberg and Genealogical Handbook of the Oesel Knighthoods by Nicolai von Essen, the family was of Saxon origin and was originated in Wittenberg. But others including the family members themselves insisted that the family was of Hollandish origin. In the Baltic Coat of Arms Book by Carl Arvid Klingspor and The introduction to the Swedish nobility's tables by Gustaf Elgenatierna, the family could trace their origins back to the medieval County of Holland, from which they were descended from a branch of the , a noble family which played a significant role in the County of Holland during the middle ages. The Tolls claimed to have descended from Willem van Teylingen, the brother of Dirk I van Brederode, whose son Floris was granted a castle from his merit which he named Tol, and according to the family, that castle was what the family was named after. Floris' descendants gradually moved east, and in the 16th century, Oswald Toll moved to Wittenberg. His son Lucas was the main ancestor of the Toll family, he was a student at the University of Wittenberg, which later he became a writer and went to Denmark, he also became an officer under Duke Magnus of Holstein. After the Bishoprics of Ösel–Wiek and Courland was sold to Frederick II of Denmark and Duke Magnus became the king of the newly- established Kingdom of Livonia, Toll followed him and received a number of land there. Lucas Toll then settled in one of his estates and continued his writing.  Finno-Swedish line  Lucas Toll's descendants divided into many branches, his family was originally based in Ösel (modern-day Saaremaa), many family members moved inland, settling in places such as Estonia and Sweden, and further dividing the family into more branches. His descendants were mainly descended from four of his grandsons, Christian (1607-1675) of the House of Medel-Arromois-Piddul, Caspar (died 1651) of the House of Kuusnõmme, Christoffer (1616-1686) of the House of Karky-Wesseldorf and Friedrich of the House of Arromois, which their descendants further divided into house which were named after their manor houses. The Swedish line was mainly descended from Caspar and Friedrich. One of Caspar's son Ebbe Christoph von Toll moved inland and entered Swedish service. Ebbe Christoph's grandson was the Swedish field marshal Johan Christopher Toll. The Swedish line was introduced into Swedish nobility in 1722, thanks to his merit, Johan Christopher Toll received respectively baronial (1799) and comital titles (1814) during his military career. As he was unmarried, the comital branch was extinct by the time of his death in 1817. Other Swedish branches continued, but also went extinct in 1880 with the death of Nikolai Alexander von Toll as his only son Alexander Nikolai died during childhood.  Baltic lines  The Baltic lines was mainly descended from Christian, Christoffer and Friedrich. The subdivided houses which were most prominent were the House of Kuckers and the House of Arroküll. The Kuckers branch was descended from the Medel-Arromois-Piddul branch and was founded by Christian Wilhelm von Toll (1720-1802). His grandson Adolf Friedrich von Toll (1773-1803) was the father of Arndt Wilhelm Gustav (1800-1863) and Robert von Toll (1802-1876), older brother Arndt Wilhelm Gustav was a supervisor in a supply fortress in Pskov. While younger brother Robert was a military officer in the Imperial Russian Army, a landlord and historian in Baltic German history. Together with Friedrich Georg von Bunge and a number of Baltic German historians, he was best remembered as the one of the authors of the , a four-part historical source about the timeline and history of Estonia and Livonia. Robert's son Harald Alexander Christian von Toll (1848-1909) was a city councilor and secretary to the head of the nobility. The most famous member of this line was the explorer and geologist Eduard Gustav von Toll (1858-1902), he gained fame for exploring the Northern Atlantic, Arctic Ocean, Siberia and the most famous Russian polar expedition of 1900–1902 of the legendary Sannikov Land, he was lost during that expedition and was never heard from since. The other branch the House of Arroküll was descended from the Karky-Wesseldorf branch and was found by the Napoleonic-Era general Karl Wilhelm von Toll, notable for his role during the War of the Sixth Coalition. He found and named this branch after the Arroküll Manor he brought in 1820. Karl Wilhelm was granted Austrian baronial title in 1814 and Russian comital title in 1829. His son, also Karl Wilhelm, was a diplomat, chamberlain and privy councillor, he was the Russian ambassador to Denmark from 1882 to 1893. He was also the ancestor of several minor Russian branches, even though he, his wife and his children were all baptised in Lutheran churches, many of them had their own children baptised in Orthodox churches because of their marriages with Russian Orthodox woman. One such descendant was his grandson Sergei Alexandrovich Tol (1848-1923), the civil governor of St. Petersburg for 14 years from 1889 to 1903 and premier master of the hunt. Other lines included the House of Kuckers-Etz and the House of Undel-Thula. The Baltic family was matriculated into the Baltic knighthoods during the course of the 18th-Century. In 1741, Ebbe Ludwig von Toll (1722-1810), landowner and heir to the Arromois and Paunküll Manors was matriculated into the Oeselian Knighthood. Christoffer Friedrich von Toll (1698-1767), landowner, heir to the Alt-Harm Manor and father of the founder of the Kuckers-Etz branch Karl Gustav von Toll (1751-1820), was matriculated into the Estonian and Livonian Knighthoods in 1746 and 1747 respectively.  Prussian and Oldenburgish lines  Some of the family members also returned to Germany for services. This line was mainly descended from Friedrich Toll.

The player controls an astronaut on a mission to destroy a planet, which is done by collecting sets of molecular structures and inserting them into \\"destruction units\\".  Gameplay  The game begins on the surface of the planet but most of the locations are underground in a maze-like network of tunnels. The astronaut can run around many game locations but can also collect a set of jet boots, allowing flight back to the surface and into other areas. Up to four items can be carried at once, using a FIFO arrangement. Progress through the game requires collecting other objects, such as a jar of \\"door jam\\" that allows certain doors to be opened, and the use of a teleport platform. Objects can be exchanged for other objects using a \\"matter transformation unit\\" on the surface of the planet, which can also act as a store. A gun is provided which can be upgraded through a series of weapons by collecting power-ups. Numerous robot enemies are spawned throughout the game, which deplete the astronaut's energy when touched. A few stationary objects are immediately deadly, and these can be destroyed using the \\"beam\\", the game's most powerful weapon.

Historical significance is a historiographical concept that defines and influences the social remembrance of past events. Historians consider knowledge of dates and events the primary content of history, or \\"first-order knowledge\\". They class historical significance as an aspect of the study of primary content, deeming it secondary or \\"second-order knowledge\\". However, the way dates and events are chosen and described is often used to assign significance, without acknowledging bias. As Winston Churchill has said: \\"History is written by the victors\\". Relevance A central topic to the study of history, historical significance defines what is remembered about the past, through its reflections in various objects of contemporary culture (images on stamps and banknotes, street names, etc.) Examining it can be an effective tool for guiding students to understand how cultural background affects perception of history and the preferences they have. Examples Historical significance is typically assessed by judging an event against pre-defined criteria. For example, UNESCO includes any site as a world heritage site, provided it \\"bear[s] a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilization\\". However, these criteria are often subjective and perception-biased or unavailable. Thus the alluding of any event as historically significant or non-significant remains open to challenge. Numerous criteria for assessing historical significance have been proposed.\\"Lesson notes\\". Cambridge University. Archived from the original on 13 January 2017.

Early life and family Bambang was born in Tegalombo village, Pacitan Regency on 24 July 1961. He studied Mathematics at IKIP Semarang. He is married to Dyah Katarina – who had served in Surabaya's city council – and the couple has three children. Career Aside from working as an educator, Bambang was active in PDI-P and he was one of the PDI-P cadres who recognised Megawati Sukarnoputri as the party's chairman during the 27 July 1996 incident. In 2000, Bambang was elected as the Vice Mayor of Surabaya with the re-elected Sunarto Sumoprawiro as Mayor. However, in early 2002, Sumoprawiro was removed by the city council for abstentions and Bambang became acting mayor until he was appointed as mayor formally on 10 June 2002. Mayor of Surabaya Early in his tenure, Surabaya's city council voted to fire Bambang on 11 July 2002, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Jakarta continued to recognise Bambang as the mayor of the city. He ran with PDI-P for the city's first direct mayoral election in 2005. After winning the election, Bambang was sworn in as mayor on 31 August 2005. During his time as mayor, Bambang engaged in populist projects, launching public projects to improve the city's drainage system and parks among others. In addition, under his time the city's government began providing free elementary and junior high education. Bambang was also supportive of the establishment of a bus rapid transit network in Surabaya during his time as Mayor, working with the Indonesian central government to implement the transportation system. In addition, during his mayorship, Bambang was also the president of the football club Persebaya, until he was sanctioned for 10 years by PSSI for asking the club to resign from the quarter-finals of the 2005 Copa Indonesia.

It is situated close to the Praia das Maçãs beach, near the town of Colares in Sintra municipality, in the Lisbon District of Portugal. The area was discovered in 1927. As an important prehistoric sepulchral site, it was classified as a national monument in 1974. Surrounded by housing, the location has been designated as a special zone of protection, and construction is forbidden. Plans by Sintra and the Directorate-General for Cultural Heritage to turn the complex into a museum area, first discussed in 2001, have not yet been implemented. For purposes of protection the site has been covered by sand and there is little presently visible. The artificial cave was probably dug into the rock in the second half of the 4th millennium BC or early in the 3rd. The tholos was added later. The site is seen as a good example of the practice of re-appropriation of symbolic locations, resulting in funeral practices of two different eras coexisting in the same space. After discovery of the site by an agricultural worker in 1927 there were limited excavations by the National Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology but little work on the necropolis was really carried out until archaeologists Vera Leisner, Georges Zbyszewski and Octávio da Veiga Ferreira excavated it, starting in 1969, after having seen items discovered unofficially by a private collector in the 1930s. Further work by Sintra Council was carried out in 1981. The Neolithic cave has a diameter of around 2 metres and was originally covered with stone supports. The later tholos was composed of a circular chamber with a diameter of approximately five and a half metres. Walls were constructed with limestone slabs placed horizontally. A pillar was raised in the centre to support a dome. An access corridor, about 3.5 metres long, connected the chamber to a 2-metre-wide atrium. Items found at the site have included geometric microliths, arrowheads, polished axes, and cylindrical idols. These have been preserved at the National Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology in Lisbon, and the Regional Museum of Sintra.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. It is currently used as a museum. History Soon after Michigan became a state, Marshall bid on becoming the state capitol. To that end, the town set aside a sizable town square as the future site of the capitol building, designating it \\"Capitol Hill.\\" However, in 1847, Lansing, Michigan was chosen as the site of the new capitol, dashing Marshall's hopes. In 1860, when Marshall constructed three new primary schools, the vacant Capitol Hill site was selected as the location of the Fourth Ward School. Sheldon Smith served as architect for the three schools and E. O. Crittenton supervised their construction. The building was used as a school until 1961, when it closed. The city gave the building to the Marshall Historical Society in 1968. It was restored by the Society, and is used as a museum. Description The Capitol Hill School is a two-room, one-story brick Gothic Revival primary school. It sits on a sandstone foundation with a brick dripmould.

She has also worked as a literary editor and translator. Biography Family provenance and early years Elke Erb was born at Scherbach (today part of Rheinbach) in the hills south of Bonn. Her parents had moved there with her uncle Otto and his family in 1937 in order, as her father put it, to \\"overwinter National Socialism\\". Ewald Erb (1903–1978), her father, worked at the local tax office, having lost his academic post as a Marxist literary historian at the University of Bonn in 1933 on account of \\"Communist activities\\". Her mother Elisabeth worked on the land. Elke was the eldest of her parents' three daughters, all born in Scherbach between 1938 and 1941 when her father was conscripted for military service. Youngest of the three sisters is the author-poet . As a member of the wartime German army Ewald Erb was at one stage charged with a form of sedition (\\"Wehrkraftzersetzung\\"), subsequently ending up as a prisoner of war. As far as the family were concerned, he was out of the picture between 1941 and 1949. In 1949 the family were reunited when Ewald Erb arranged for his wife and daughters to rejoin him at Halle in the Soviet occupation zone. By this time, he had already been working at Halle University for two years, having arrived directly from a British prisoner-of-war facility in 1947. However, Ewald Erb was living in Halle in a single rented room containing one writing desk and one bed. There was space for the girls' mother, but the children were sent to live in a \\"home\\" (a recently re-assigned boarding school) for the next two years. For Elke Erb, approaching her teenage years, the result of the disruption and uncertainty was a lasting alienation from her parents. Education After the war ended she attended school locally. At this point, the family all believed that her father was \\"missing in action\\". The move to Halle involved a change of school when Elke Erb was eleven. She successfully concluded her school career by passing the Abitur (final exams) in 1957. That was followed by a year as a farm worker during 1958/59 in the context of the Free German Youth (\\"Freie Deutsche Jugend\\" / FDJ) land-improvement project with a farm collective at Altmärkische Wische. This form of required \\"gap year\\" before embarking on higher education was not unusual in the German Democratic Republic at this time. (The postwar Soviet occupation zone had been relaunched and rebranded as the Soviet sponsored \\"German Democratic Republic\\" – East Germany - in October 1949.) She then, between 1959 and 1963, undertook a four- year degree course at Halle University in order to qualify as a teacher of German and Russian. She emerged with the necessary qualification along with the insight that for her a career in teaching would be nightmarish. Literary editor Erb then worked first as a volunteer and then as a literary editor with Mitteldeutscher Verlag between 1963 and 1966. This brought her into contact with several successful members of the East German literary establishment. She left after two years, however. In the second half of 1965 and early 1966 she was as a patient at a mental hospital. Later, she moved to Berlin and set about starting a career as a freelance writer. Initially she lived in a one-room top-floor apartment in Berlin- Hohenschönhausen. She worked on texts of her own, writing reviews for publishers on Russian dramas and on works of fiction. Soon she moved into a shared apartment with the author-poet Adolf Endler in the centre of Berlin \\"five floors up, with an outdoor toilet\\". They married in 1968. Her first published poems appeared in 1968. By this time she had relocated permanently to Berlin. Writer and translator In 1969 she undertook a lengthy visit to Georgia. Her first major pieces of translation, which appeared in 1974, were of texts by Marina Tsvetaeva. She produced poetry and prose works and further translations, notably of novels by Oleg Alexandrovitch Yuryev and poems by Olga Martynova. There were German language adaptations, mostly from Russian texts, but also from English, Italian and Georgian ones. She worked as an editor-compiler, at one point, for instance, of the annual \\"Jahrbuch der Lyrik\\". Elke Erb became, over the years, something of an inspiration and mentor for the Prenzlauer-Berg literary set. Her closeness to the evolving independent peace movement, her involvement in 1981 with an \\"unofficial\\" anthology of lyric poetry and her protests (with others) in 1983 against the deprivation of citizenship of the young civil rights activist Roland Jahn all combined to make her a focus for Stasi surveillance. There was an attempt by the national executive of the (East) German Writers' Association under the chairmanship of Hermann Kant to exclude her from membership or at least to restrict her travel privileges, which would have severely restricted her ability to earn a living by writing, but the exclusion was never carried through by her local Berlin branch.

The paradigm draws from various scientific research fields, being strongly inspired by the way humans work together in teams, and constituting a special type of multi-agent system.  Concept  Software agents that behave as artificial team players satisfy the following general requirements: * Observability: agents must make their status, intentions, knowledge observable to others. * Predictability: agents must be predictable to others such that others can rely on them when considering their own actions * Directability: agents must be capable of directing the behavior of others, as well as be directed by others. To satisfy these OPD requirements, agents exhibit various behaviors such as: * Proactively communicating information to other agents to establish shared situation awareness within the team * Explaining their decisions and recommendations to other teammates to establish appropriate levels of trust (also known as Explainable artificial intelligence) * Receiving instructions at a high level of abstraction. *Choosing the right moment of interaction to prevent inconvenient interruptions of other team members. * Notifying others when they believe they can no longer contribute their part of the work required to fulfill the team goal. The engineering efforts to develop artificial team members include user interface design, but also the design of specialized social artificial intelligence, that enables agents to reason about whether some piece of information is worthy of sharing.  Frameworks  Various frameworks have been developed that support the software engineering effort of building human agent teams, such as KAoS, and SAIL . Engineering methodologies for human agent teaming include Coactive design  Applications  Human agent teaming is a popular paradigm to approach the interaction between humans and AI technologies in various domains such as defense, healthcare, space, disaster response.

Fortune was an African Methodist Episcopal Church layman and was appointed to the county board of voter registration. In the 1850s Fortune married Sarah Jane Miers; the couple's son, Timothy Thomas Fortune, became a noted radical newspaper editor and activist for African American rights. Fortune was elected to the 1868 Florida Constitutional Convention as one of four representatives for Jackson County. Fortune was forced to leave Jackson Country due to lawlessness and served the remainder of his elected term in Jacksonville. In November 1871 Jackson testified at the United States Senate Select Committee on Outrages in Southern States, a special session of the 42nd United States Congress that investigated Ku Klux Klan violence in North Carolina and Florida. Jackson was questioned by the chairman of the committee, Henry Wilson, and Thomas F. Bayard.

Christians have visited this small church, known as the “Lady Chapel”, for centuries and continue the tradition through an annual pilgrimage every summer on the Sunday nearest the Feast of the Assumption, 15 August.  History  Its precise origins and history are unknown although records show that in 1397 John Ingelby was granted a licence for a chapel and the celebration of Mass. This mirrors the history of the nearby Mount Grace Priory when in 1398 Thomas de Holand (Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey) was granted a licence to found a Carthusian Monastery at Bordelby. Little else is known about the Lady Chapel except that a former Franciscan, Thomas Parkinson, entered the hermitage at the Lady Chapel, provided for by Catharine of Aragon, in about 1515. He probably stayed until the 1539 dissolution of Mount Grace Priory and other religious sites. After this time, the Lady Chapel fell into a state of neglect and ruin. Despite falling into ruin, the Lady Chapel continued to attract pilgrims and according to Fr A. J. Storey 16 people were arrested on the eve of Little Lady Day, 7 September 1614, and later confessed to praying there.Mount Grace Lady Chapel An Historical Enquiry A. J. Storey Other reported visitors include the sisters from the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary, praying for their founder, Mary Ward, when she was seriously ill. She herself later came to the chapel to give thanks for her recovery. When John Wesley visited the area in 1745, he wrote “I saw the poor remains of the old chapel on the brow of the hill, as well as those of the Carthusian Monastery, (called Mount Grace), which lay at the foot of it.” In the modern era, Flora Dysart describes in her book \\"The Pilgrims’ Way\\" how her grandmother, Flora Margaret Morrish, persuaded the local landowner, Sir Hugh Bell, to grant her a lease on the cottage adjoining the Lady Chapel with a view to restoration. Eventually, John Scott, 4th Earl of Eldon and Ralph Scrope bought the Lady Chapel site. They then established a Trust to manage the rebuilding of the chapel; the adjoining cottage had been restored by Flora Margaret Morrish.  Restoration  Plans to restore the chapel were approved and planning permission was granted in 1957. The following year the Lady Chapel was recognised as a national monument and the first Diocese of Middlesbrough Feast of the Assumption of Our Lady pilgrimage was organised. This has since become an annual event attracting hundreds of pilgrims on the Sunday closest to the 15 August feast. Restoration started in 1959 and on the Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, 8 September 1961, William Godfrey Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster rededicated the chapel.  Features  The chapel contains a 17th-century statue of the Madonna and Child and a carved wooden crucifix, both donated by Lady Eldon. It also has three stained glass windows which feature the coat of arms of Queen Katharine of Aragon, the Scrope and Eldon families respectively.  The chapel today  The chapel is now within the pastoral responsibilities of St Mary's Cathedral in Middlesbrough Masses and services take place during the year, with a Vigil Mass being offered at 4 pm on Saturdays (fulfilling the Sunday obligation) and on feasts of Our Lady, and the chapel remains open at all times. In 2016 Bishop of Middlesbrough Terence Patrick Drainey founded a group, the Friends of the Lady Chapel, with the purpose of preserving and promoting the shrine.

Thomson treated the richer patients, while Moorhead, who had less need or desire for money, treated the poor. Their premises were originally at 93 Nethergate, where Moorhead lived. Around 1900 they moved the practice to 4 Tay Square where a plaque now commemorates them. In 1897, Moorhead and Thomson set up the Dundee Women's Hospital and Dispensary on Seafield Road. The hospital offered all- female staff to exclusively treat female patients. The primary focus was as to be a maternity hospital, including aftercare of mother and child.

History  According Lee Min-hyung for Korea Times, Korean Ministry of National Defense pushed for the establishment of the Ground Operations Command since 1998, with calls to decrease number of soldiers and improve operational efficiency under a single control point. In 2015, the Government announced its intention to establish a command to be in charge of the Army's ground operations by 2018, after delaying the transfer of control of troops in case of war. The Ground Operations Command has been created by combining the army's First and Third Army commands, which defended the eastern and western frontline areas. The establishment of the Command is part of President Moon Jae-in's military reform plan. In 16 April 2020, Special Operations Commander, Lieutenant general Nam Young-sin was promoted to General, and was appointed as Ground Operations Commander.  Mission  According to General Woon-yong Kim, the mission entrusted to the Ground Operations Command consists of deterring the full spectrum of threats by maintaining watertight readiness posture even outside open wartime. To this end, the Ground Operations Command guards the Military Demarcation Line in combat readiness. In times of armed conflict, the Ground Operations Command will serve as the Ground Component Command under the combined forces command of South Korea and the United States.

It is his first book in 24 years since the release of Miss America (1995). Background By early 2017, Stern had been broadcasting his radio show on SiriusXM for eleven years and looked into the idea of writing a third book, following Private Parts (1993) and Miss America (1995). He entered discussions with Simon & Schuster, the publisher of Private Parts, who were keen to release it and assigned editor and publisher Jonathan Karp to collaborate with Stern on the project. At first Stern felt apprehensive about writing a third book because his first two had reached \\"crazy\\" levels of success. Karp was determined to make the process easy for Stern, however, and in April 2017, having discussed the idea of printing a selection of celebrity interviews from his radio show, visited Stern's Manhattan apartment and presented him with a mockup book of 30 transcripts that he had chosen, complete with a book jacket. Stern was flattered over the gesture, which convinced him to go ahead with the project. Shortly before the book's release, Stern revealed that a key reason to write a third book was his cancer scare in May 2017, after a growth was found on one of his kidneys which turned out to be a benign cyst. Writing By the time Stern started on the book, he had decided to expand its initial concept and write not only commentary on some of his favorite interviews, but autobiographical chapters on his life and career in recent years. He decided against using the interviews that Karp originally chose and set about the task of picking his own, trawling through hundreds of transcripts until he settled on 40 and prepared an introduction for each one. Stern also combined excerpts from interviews on a unifying theme, including sex and relationships and money and fame. During this process, Stern decided to include passages from on-air conversations with Donald Trump throughout the book that date back as early as 1995. Stern had planned to complete the book in one year, but this editing process took time which delayed the project by a further year. Stern had to remind Karp to remain patient for him to deliver and dedicated most of his weekends and vacation time to write it, something that he had done on his previous books and vowed \\"would never do again.\\" Upon completion, Stern said: \\"I put my heart and soul into this book and could not be more proud of it.\\" The worldwide publishing rights were acquired by Jonathan Kara and Sean Manning from Stern's agent. Announcement In June 2018, Stern revealed on his radio show that he had started on a \\"secret project\\" and was looking through old photos of himself to use for it. Two months later, the book appeared in the upcoming titles section on Simon & Schuster's website with an initial release date of September 25, 2018. The incident generated some media interest, including from Artie Lange and John Melendez, two former staff members of The Howard Stern Show who speculated what the book was going to be about. After the initial release date was pushed back, Stern formally announced the book on his radio show on March 12, 2019, revealing its title and front cover. Within hours of the announcement, the strength of pre-order sales made the book number one on Amazon's best seller list. A rift developed between Stern and talk show host Wendy Williams, who discussed the book on her show and alleged Stern had lost his edge from his past shock jock days and had become \\"so Hollywood right now\\". Stern retaliated on the air the following morning, feeling insulted and told Williams to \\"keep your opinion to yourself\\". Two months later, Stern apologised to Williams for his reaction: \\"If 'Hollywood' means that I've evolved in some way and the show has changed, then yeah, she hit the nail on the head.\\" Content In addition to the celebrity interviews and Stern's commentary on them, the book details Stern's departure from terrestrial radio in 2005 and his move to SiriusXM the following year, his life and career since then. The Hollywood Reporter described his introductions to the celebrity interviews as \\"like a series of love letters to his subjects.\\" Celebrities that are featured in the book include Madonna, Mike Tyson, Lady Gaga, Billy Joel, Jimmy Kimmel, and Jerry Seinfeld. Stern revealed that his 2015 interview with Conan O'Brien as his favorite of his career. Release and reception The book was released on May 14, 2019 in hardcover and electronic formats. Stern embarked on a media tour to promote the book, granting press, radio, and television interviews. Prior to the book's release Stern hired Leslee Dart as a publicist. On the day of release, the book entered Amazon's best seller list at number one. An excerpt from the book was exclusively published online by Rolling Stone. The book entered The New York Times Best Seller list at No. 1 under the hardcover and combined print and e-book categories. In a review for Atlanta Journal- Constitution, Melissa Ruggieri thought the book is \\"a gorgeous compendium\\" of interviews and praised Stern's interviewing style with a voice \\"always prominent as a narrator and guide through these engrossing dives into the lives of others.\\" A more critical review from Maureen Callahan appeared in The New York Post who considered it a \\"drag\\" to see Stern promote a book that contains \\"just 17 pages of new, personal material – and if you've seen any of his interviews, you know exactly what's on those pages.\\" References Category:2019 non-fiction books Category:American biographies Category:Show business memoirs Category:Books by Howard Stern Category:Books of interviews ","title":"Howard Stern Comes Again"},{"id":"60209863","text":"This is a list of notable people who have attended the Julian Ashton Art School.

The squat lasted from 1997 until its eviction in early 2019. Around 130 people lived on the terrain of 45 hectares in buildings, on boats and in vehicles. History ADM (de Amsterdamsche Droogdok Maatschappij) was the name of the Amsterdam drydock company which had previously occupied the site before going bankrupt in 1985. The ADM terrain was first squatted in the mid 1980s and amongst other things was used as a music studio (Joke's Koeienverhuur). It was evicted in early 1993 since the owner allegedly had urgent plans for the terrain. The ownership was then transferred several times before ending up with Chidda Vastgoed BV and Amstelimmo BV, two companies owned by Bertus Lūske, the notorious speculator, who paid 27 million guilders for the parcel. Occupation Since by 1997 nothing at all was happening on the terrain, it was resquatted by a group of 100 people, some of whom had lived there already. The date of the resquat was October 12, 1997. On January 21, 1998, thugs hired by Lūske (the owner) came to the terrain and threatened people. They returned on March 3, banging on windows with iron bars. They then came back a third time on April 25, in the very early morning and began to demolish the building with an excavator machine. The confrontation was filmed. In a stroke of good fortune, none of the people sleeping in the building were harmed. The police were called and eventually defused the situation. In 1999, a court gave Lūske 240 hours of community service for attempted manslaughter and he was ordered to pay 1000 guilders to four ADM residents in damages. Lūske was eventually assassinated in 2003 by unknown associates in the Amsterdam criminal underworld. He was shot outside a restaurant in front of his family. Activities As well as being a place for people to live and work, ADM acted as an infoshop and social centre organising many events. To take September 2013 as an example, there was a barnight every Sunday, games and a freeshop every Wednesday, three concerts, a cabaret evening and a DIY festival with bands, stalls and a free market. The ADM festival celebrated the anniversary of the occupation every year in mid October. In August 1998, the squatters organised a large festival called Drydock which later developed into Robodock, a festival of alternative arts and culture which was to occur annually for a number of years. Tragically, a young Italian DJ (Antonio) was killed on the opening night of Drydock when someone drove a truck at full speed through wooden doors into the performance space. After tense negotiations with the police and Antonio's friends, it was decided to continue the party. When the mains electricity cable to ADM was cut in 2007 and therefore the residents had to acquire a generator to provide power, which was used for several years before the mains connection was reinstituted, this led to a ‘Generator Madness’ festival in 2007, at which the ADM symbol was first seen (a detourned version of the electricity company logo). By the 2010s, ADM defined itself as a ‘cultural freehaven’ and had become a place known far beyond the Netherlands. Local Amsterdam television station AT5 produced a six part series on ADM called the Lost Free State (De Verloren Vrijstaat) in 2018, which can be watched as one long segment on vimeo. Eviction In 2015, ADM again came under threat of eviction. This resulted in an extremely complex situation with numerous courtcases (over 20). The three main parties in the dispute were the owner (still Chidda Vastgoed BV and Amstelimmo BV), the city council and the ADM squatters. The argument of the owner was that they wanted to rent the terrain to Koole Maritime BV, but the plans of Koole were repeatedly found to be inadequate in court. Also involved were groups such as the National Authority for Business (Rijksdienst voor Ondernemers), the people living in caravans outside the ADM terrain, local political parties and so on. ADM won some of the courtcases. A petition in support of ADM which asked the Mayor to intervene in order to preserve the cultural freehaven was signed by over 20,000 people. Ultimately after several years, the final juridical decision was that the 130 ADM residents needed to leave ADM before December 25, 2018. An alternative site was offered by the Amsterdam Council for a two- year period with limited space and no possibility to moor boats. It became known as the sludge fields. About 50 of the residents did not leave, resulting in a largescale unannounced eviction on January 7, 2019. That evening, a noise demonstration was held for the 11 arrestees. On January 20, 2019, ex-residents of ADM and supporters slept outside at the Dam Square to protest the eviction.

Some 3,000 of her works have been listed, many of them documenting historical events. A feminist ahead of her time, she saw the role of women as being to study and to learn. Biography Stéphanie de Virieu, self-portrait (1810) Born on 14 July 1785 in Saint-Mandé, Val de Marne, Stéphanie de Virieu was the daughter of François-Henri de Virieu, a nobleman, and Élisabeth Digeon de Monteton. Her father was killed on 9 October 1793 during the Siege of Lyon. As their home, the Château de Pupetières in Châbons, Isère, was completely destroyed by the revolutionaries, in 1803 the family bought the Château de Lemps in Le Grand-Lemps. When she was 13, Stéphanie de Virieu was introduced to drawing by Lavoipierre, one of Jacques-Louis David's students, later continuing her studies under another of his students, Grégorius. In the early 1820s, she made a lengthy study trip to Italy, examining works of art and taking painting lessons from the Italian masters. From September 1823 to February 1824, she stayed in Rome, Naples, Turin and Florence, bringing back many drawings and watercolours. De Virieu painted portraits of her family and her friends, including Joseph de Maistre and Alphonse de Lamartine. She also had a carpentry shop where she created statues, pieces of furniture and religious decorations. When she was 78, she sculpted a fireplace decoration in stone, tracing the story of her 12th-century ancestors. Her last work, a sculpted series of the Stations of the Cross, is to be found in the Church of Poudenas. Stéphanie de Virieu died in Poudenas on 9 May 1873 in the home of her mother's family.

Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer designed the complex during their relatively short period as collaborative partners after receiving a commission from the FWA. In the United States, their partnership mostly produced single-family residences. The complex was originally designed as affordable housing for workers in nearby defense plants. These workers were mostly employed by Alcoa, an aluminum conglomerate headquartered in Pittsburgh. The complex originally contained 250 residential units, an elementary school, and a community center. The Modern design of the complex proved controversial, and local residents opposed the construction. History Background The complex in 1994.The FWA commissioned Modernist architects such as Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, Oscar Stonorov, and Richard J. Neutra to provide \\"modern\\" housing for workers and low-income families throughout the country. This focus on Modernist and Internationalist architects was colored by the hope that the developments, which included then- rare shared amenities such as play areas for children, laundries, and sports facilities, would foster a sense of community, and render more traditional urban and suburban arrangements (referred to as \\"isolated\\") unappealing. Beyond ACT, examples of such housing include Techwood Homes, in Atlanta, and the Carl Mackley Houses, in Philadelphia. Due to American involvement in World War II, strains were placed on housing near industrial sites. The Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Division of the FWA assessed the availability of housing for defense-related workers. In areas where production might be threatened by scarce labor due to housing shortages, the DDH made recommendations that housing be built. World War II and construction Based on recommendations by the Defense Housing Division and approval by President Roosevelt, the FWA commissioned Aluminum City Terrace as part of a plan to bring some 5000 new units to Pittsburgh and the surrounding area. An increase in employees at plants near New Kensington had created a particularly accute housing shortage, with vacancy rates as low as 0.6%, necessitating new units. Alcoa, New Kensington's primary employer, expressed skepticism over FWA plans for Aluminum City Terrace due to fears the development's emphasis of social components could render unionization efforts among its employees easier. Industrial concerns at the time also preferred that their employees purchase housing, rather than rent, as it tethered them financially and geographically to the plant, so reducing overturn. As plans were released, locals, including New Kensington mayoral candidate and real estate owner W.C. Wally, opposed the development as they resented its intrusion into the local real estate market. Wally and others opposed it based on aesthetic grounds as well. Wally dismissed the project as \\"chicken coops\\" but despite winning the mayoral race and did not succeed in preventing its construction. He did, however, renege on a promise by the previous mayor to finance a new road to make accessing Aluminum City Terrace easier, and to date the road has not been built. During construction, components of the development were standardized to accelerate construction. A compressed timeline meant Gropius could not prepare using larger-scale offsite prefabrication for ACT, an approach he had experimented with in Germany. After construction, workers were skeptical about the housing, as it did not accommodate oversized kitchen appliances and furniture. Additionally, a stigma developed around the complex, with some referring to it as \\"the project\\" due to the government's involvement in its construction. However, the housing did successfully foster a sense of community, partially due to programming at the now-defunct community center. After World War II Both residents of ACT and New Kensington worried that the end of World War II would mean the sale of the complex to a private company, or its conversion to low-income, government-supported housing. Residents of the complex instead lobbied the Housing and Home Finance Agency to purchase the complex and convert it to a co-op. After gaining enough support, residents were successful, and purchased the complex in 1948. Funds for the down payment came from selling shares in the co-op, and a bank financed the rest. The community is still extant as a co-op today, and remains affordable, with monthly fees ranging from $330 and $350. Design The buildings are well-preserved relative to other instances of Bauhaus and Modernist architecture.

Plot Milea, now engaged in a relationship with Dilan, now faces problems with Dilan being an aggressive motorbike gang of his school, in which he is now expelled from, as well as involved in other aggressive activities, i.e. fights. Even with that, she continued genuinely being romantic with him. After the release, Milea's cousin Yugo comes home from Belgium, and started acting incestuous towards Milea. One night, Dilan was caught planning an attack in late night, and Milea threatened him that she will break up with him if he does not change. Seeing Yugo as a foreign man in the car, Dilan does not see this as a threat and thus continues, to the point where he is caught for being involved in an attack using his father's pistol, in which his father is in the military and has affiliations to the police. One day, Milea's parents advised her to guide Yugo around Bandung, including the impromptu movie watching. In the theater, Yugo kissed Milea; she ran away from the mall in rage and asked Yugo not to see her again. In an apology meeting, Milea brought Dilan and used him to make Yugo fearful of doing inappropriate things. One day, Milea learned that Dilan is involved in another attack; this time he is kicked out by his mom and thus refuges at the gang leader's house, in which a lot of the members does. Milea's presence signals Dilan to approach her naively; he was slapped and they broke up under Milea's request. Dilan insisted her to bring her home and she has to by force. Milea was protected by Dilan's mother while she lectures Dilan at a stadium; Dilan left coldly, leaving Milea crying under the shoulders of Dilan's mother.

Nehru's foreign-policy: 1947-1966 Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, usually with the assistance of Krishna Menon, shaped India's foreign policy. At first, it was vague and rather grandiose dream of forging an international coalition of non-colonial and the colonized powers, but the world was rapidly bifurcated by the emergence of the Cold War between the West, led by the United States and Britain, and the East, led by the Soviet Union. It was urgent to develop policies regarding the Cold War, as well as relations with Pakistan, Britain, and the Commonwealth. The rest could wait. Nehru and the Congress looked on the Soviet Union with distrust, reassuring the West that there was not the least chance of India lining up with the Soviet Union in war or peace. Sarvepalli Gopal, Jawaharlal Nehru: A Biography. 1947-1956. Volume Two (1979) 43-65. Nehru intensely disliked the Cold War--the more India got involved, he believed, the worse for his long-term objectives of economic and national development. He took the lead in the non-aligned movement.Odd Arne Westad, The Cold War: A World History (2017) pp 423-448. Nehru kept India's membership in the British Commonwealth, despite the widespread distrust of Britain across his Congress party. Popular grievances included the British UN delegation openly supported Pakistan on the Kashmir issue, Britain providing military advice to Pakistan, and London supporting the Dutch efforts to crush Indonesian nationalism. At that time the Commonwealth was little more than a debating society, but one objective was to use it as a sounding board for Third World interests. Non-membership would leave Pakistan in a stronger position. Another factor was the clear need for American help in terms of aid, loans, and trade. Nehru did not want to be too indebted to the Americans, and in that sense, the British and Commonwealth connection would be something of a counterweight. He did insist that the symbolic importance of the King be strictly limited, so there was no sense whatever of royal sovereignty in India.Gopal, Nehru 2:55-58. The Soviet Union was angry at India's hostility, and with the Kremlin control of the Indian Communist Party stirred up repeated attacks in Parliament and in media. Nehru set out to establish a conference of the states bordering the Indian Ocean, from Egypt and Ethiopia to the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand. It was an ambitious plan and gave Nehru the opportunity to give advice to the recently decolonized governments in the region, especially Burma and Ceylon. The Indian efforts were plotted in the United States, but let nowhere. At the United Nations, the Soviets supported Pakistan and there was a move to demand arbitration or a plebiscite, but India steadfastly repudiated the notions. Nehru insisted that Indian troops would not be withdrawn from Kashmir. With favorable publicity in America, Nehru and Menon discussed whether India should \\"align with the United States 'somewhat' and build up our economic and military strength.\\"Gopal, Nehru 2: 59. He made a major visit to the United States and Canada in October 1949. The Truman administration was quite favorable and indicated it would give Nehru anything he asked for. He proudly refused to beg and thereby forfeited the chance for a gift of a million tons of wheat. The American Secretary of State Dean Acheson recognized Nehru's potential world role but added that he was \\"one of the most difficult men with whom I have ever had to deal.\\"Gopal, Nehru 2:60. The American visit was a partial success, in that Nehru gained widespread support for his nation, and he himself gained a much deeper understanding of the American outlook.Rudra Chaudhuri, Forged in crisis: India and the United States since 1947 (2014) pp 25-47.. He also stiffened his negative attitude toward the Soviet Union, and also towards the new communist state of China. Nehru was especially annoyed that Moscow had adopted a negative and destructive approach to South East Asia, apparently trying to destabilize the region. Informally, Nehru made it clear that it would help defend Nepal and South East Asia against any communist aggression.Gopal, Nehru 2: 64-65. Nehru dramatically changed course in 1950. After first voting in the United States nations against the North Korean invasion of South Korea, India announced the only real solution was to admit Communist China to the United Nations. This position greatly pleased Moscow and Beijing but distressed Washington. In 1951 he refused to participate in the Japanese peace treaty, considering it an American imperialistic venturer to seize control of Japanese policies. The net result was that India gained prestige in the Third World, and set the stage for a close relationship with the Soviet Union.Robert Barnes, \\"Between the blocs: India, the United Nations, and ending the Korean war.\\" Journal of Korean Studies 18.2 (2013): 263-286. Online Pakistan, meanwhile, grew much closer to the United States and even seriously considered sending troops to fight alongside the Americans in Korea. This set the stage for an American transition to favor Pakistan strongly over India.G.W. Choudhury, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the major powers: politics of a divided subcontinent (1975) pp 15-16.. Nehru developed from Buddhist thought the Panchsheel (also known as the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence), which would be included in future agreements. Nehru based India's foreign policy on these five principles, as articulated in 1954: * coexistence * respect for the territorial and integral sovereignty of others * nonaggression * non-interference with the internal affairs of others * recognition of the equality of others. He did not mention a fierce determination to retain control of the Kashmir, a goal that would soon emerge.  Indira Gandhi foreign-policy: 1966-1984 The stated aims of the foreign policy of the Indira Gandhi premiership between 1967-1977 include a focus on security, by fighting militants abroad and strengthening border defenses. On 30 October 1981 at the meeting organised to mark silver jubilee celebration of the School of International Studies, Gandhi said, \\"A country’s policy is shaped by many forces- its position on the map, and the countries which are its neighbours, the policies they adopt, and the actions they take, as well as its historical experiences in the aggregate and in terms of its particular success or traumas.\\" In early 1971, disputed elections in Pakistan led East Pakistan to declare independence as Bangladesh. Repression and violence by the Pakistani army led 10 million refugees to cross border in to India over the coming months. Finally in December 1971, Gandhi directly intervened in the conflict to defeat Pakistan's army in Bangladesh. India emerged victorious in the resulting conflict to become the dominant power of South Asia. India had signed a treaty with the Soviet Union promising mutual assistance in the case of war, while Pakistan received active support from the United States during the conflict.Nixon's dislike of 'witch' Indira, BBC News, 29 June 2005. BBC News (29 June 2005). Retrieved on 18 June 2011. U.S. President Richard Nixon disliked Gandhi personally. Relations with the U.S. became distant as Gandhi developed closer ties with the Soviet Union after the war. The latter grew to become India's largest trading partner and its biggest arms supplier.  Foreign policy since 1989 After collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War in 1989, India no longer had to deal with its nonaligned position in the Cold War. Diplomat Shivshankar Menon identified six major policy decisions. They were: the 1993 Border Peace and Tranquility Agreement with China;Menon, pp 7-33.C. Raja Mohan, \\"Soft borders and cooperative frontiers: India's changing territorial diplomacy towards Pakistan and China.\\" Strategic Analysis 31.1 (2007): 1-23. the Civil Nuclear Agreement with the United States in 2005;Menon, 34-59. the rejection of force against Pakistan after the 2008 Mumbai attacks;Menon, pp 60-81. dealing with Sri Lanka's civil war;Menon, pp 82-104. and announcing a policy of No first use of nuclear weapons.Menon, pp 105-23.  Pakistan Relations between India and Pakistan have been complex and largely hostile due to a number of historical and political events. Relations between the two states have been defined by the violent partition of British India in 1947 which started the Kashmir conflict, and the numerous military conflicts fought between the two nations. Consequently, their relationship has been plagued by hostility and suspicion. Northern India and Pakistan somewhat overlap in areas of certain demographics and shared lingua francas (mainly Punjabi, Sindhi and Hindustani). After the dissolution of the British Raj in 1947, two new sovereign nations were formed—the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan. The subsequent partition of the former British India displaced up to 12.5 million people, with estimates of loss of life varying from several hundred thousand to 1 million. India emerged as a secular nation with a Hindu majority population and a large Muslim minority, while Pakistan with a Muslim majority population and a large Hindu minority later became an Islamic RepublicArea, Population, Density and Urban/Rural Proportion by Administrative Units although its constitution guaranteed freedom of religion to people of all faiths. It later lost most of its Hindu minority due to migration and after East Pakistan was separated in the Bangladesh Liberation War. Soon after their independence, India and Pakistan established diplomatic relations but the violent partition and numerous territorial claims would overshadow their relationship. Since their Independence, the two countries have fought three major wars, one undeclared war and have been involved in numerous armed skirmishes and military standoffs. The Kashmir conflict is the main centre-point of all of these conflicts with the exception of the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 and Bangladesh Liberation War, which resulted in the secession of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). There have been numerous attempts to improve the relationship—notably, the Shimla summit, the Agra summit and the Lahore summit. Since the early 1980s, relations between the two nations soured particularly after the Siachen conflict, the intensification of Kashmir insurgency in 1989, Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests in 1998 and the 1999 Kargil war. Certain confidence-building measures — such as the 2003 ceasefire agreement and the Delhi–Lahore Bus service – were successful in de-escalating tensions. However, these efforts have been impeded by periodic terrorist attacks. The 2001 Indian Parliament attack almost brought the two nations to the brink of a nuclear war. The 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings, which killed 68 civilians (most of whom were Pakistani), was also a crucial point in relations. Additionally, the 2008 Mumbai attacks carried out by Pakistani militants resulted in a severe blow to the ongoing India-Pakistan peace talks. After a brief thaw following the election of new governments in both nations, bilateral discussions again stalled after the 2016 Pathankot attack. In September 2016, a terrorist attack on an Indian military base in Indian- administered Kashmir, the deadliest such attack in years, killed 19 Indian Army soldiers. India's claim that the attack had been orchestrated by a Pakistan-supported jihadist group was denied by Pakistan, which claimed the attack had been a local reaction to unrest in the region due to excessive force by Indian security personnel. The attack sparked a military confrontation across the Line of Control, with an escalation in ceasefire violations and further militant attacks on Indian security forces. Since 2016, the ongoing confrontation, continued terrorist attacks and an increase in nationalist rhetoric on both sides has resulted in the collapse of bilateral relations, with little expectation they will recover. Notably, following the 2019 Pulwama attack, the Indian government revoked Pakistan's most favoured nation trade status, which it had granted to Pakistan in 1996. India also increased the custom duty to 200% which majorly affected the trade of Pakistani apparel and cement. Since the election of new governments in both India and Pakistan in the early 2010s, some attempts have been made to improve relations, in particular developing a consensus on the agreement of Non- Discriminatory Market Access on Reciprocal Basis (NDMARB) status for each other, which will liberalize trade. Both India and Pakistan are members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and its South Asian Free Trade Area. Pakistan used to host a pavilion at the annual India International Trade Fair which drew huge crowds. Deteriorating relations between the two nations resulted in boycott of Pakistani traders at the trade fair. In November 2015, the new Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif agreed to the resumption of bilateral talks; the following month, Prime Minister Modi made a brief, unscheduled visit to Pakistan while en route to India, becoming the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Pakistan since 2004. Despite those efforts, relations between the countries have remained frigid, following repeated acts of cross-border terrorism. According to a 2017 BBC World Service poll, only 5% of Indians view Pakistan's influence positively, with 85% expressing a negative view, while 11% of Pakistanis view India's influence positively, with 62% expressing a negative view. In August 2019, following the approval of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill in the Indian Parliament, which revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, further tension was brought between the two countries, with Pakistan downgrading their diplomatic ties, closing its airspace and suspending bilateral trade with India.  Non-aligned movement  Russia Soviet Ambassador Kirill Novikov arriving in New Delhi 1947 to establish formal diplomatic relations with India The long-standing close relationship abruptly ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991. The steep decline ended by the mid-1990s with the new partnership organized by the Russian leader Vladimir Putin. In the 21st century, the goals of Russian foreign policy include the expansion of economic cooperation, weapon and technology transfer, and cultural exchange.

Poehlmann was born in Tilsit, present-day Sovetsk (Russia), in the Prussian province of East Prussia. She became a teacher, founding a private school for girls in 1888, which she led as headmistress until 1920. She was a prominent figure in the German Women's Movement during the German Empire. She led the East Prussian federation of Women's Associations. At the end of World War I, she joined the German People's Party (Deutsche Volkspartei, or DVP). In the elections for the Prussian Constitutional Convention, the first time women were allowed to vote, she gained a seat in parliament. She retained her seat in 1921 and was a member of the Prussian Landtag until her death in 1923. Early life and family Margarete Poehlmann was born on 29 June 1856 in Tilsit, which at the time was part of the Prussian province of East Prussia. Her father was a professor. She had a brother, who died in his youth. Poehlmann visited a higher girl's school, followed by further education at a teacher's college. She made educational trips to both England and France before entering school service. Poehlmann never married. In 1876, she started working as a teacher at the Höhere Mädchenschule in Tilsit, while at the same time caring for her ill parents. Headmistress and leader in the women's movement As public schools did not grant the leading position she demanded to women, Poehlmann founded her own private girls' school in 1888, the Höhere Privat-Mädchenschule. She served as headmistress here until 1920. In 1909, the school took her name, being known from then on as Margarete-Poehlmann-Schule. On 1 October 1920, it was transformed into a public institution. Poehlmann continued her own education as well, making extended visits to England, Switzerland and Russia. During several stays in Berlin, she visited lectures at Friedrich Wilhelm University, including some held by Ernst Troeltsch. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Poehlmann began to work in the Women's Rights Movement. From 1906 until 1919, she served as a member of the board of the Allgemeiner Deutscher Lehrerinnenverein (General German Association of Female Teachers), which included consulting the Prussian State Government during a reform of girls' schools. Until her death, she was the chairwoman of the Federation of East Prussian Women's Associations (Verband Ostpreußischer Frauenvereine), which she founded and included 25 associations with a total of more than 5,000 members. The focus of her work was not suffrage, but education for girls and women, a topic on which she wrote numerous books and articles. In Tilsit, she ran a successful career consultation office for young women. Politics At the end of World War I, Poehlmann became a member of the newly-founded German People's Party (Deutsche Volkspartei, or DVP). On 26 January 1919, the elections for the Prussian Constitutional Convention were held, the first in which women were allowed to vote and be elected. She won the election in the electoral district of Ostpreußen 1, gaining a seat in parliament. On 19 March 1919, Poehlmann became the first elected woman to hold a speech in a Prussian parliament. Although the topic of the debate was the arrest of two members of the diet in Poland, Poehlmann took the opportunity to point out the historic moment: In her speech, she also expressed disappointment in the fact that women's suffrage had to be achieved through revolution instead of a sincere acceptance of women's achievements. Poehlmann fought for equality in language as well. At the time of her election, it was still customary to address an unmarried woman as Fräulein instead of Frau (equivalent to the English Mrs. and Ms.). Due to pressure by Poehlmann and others, this was changed in official guidelines from the Prussian Ministry of the Interior. In a speech on 27 November 1920, she also demanded that the descriptions of titles in public administrations would no longer be used in just the male form (e.g. Rätin as opposed to Rat). This demand was however not met. In parliament, Poehlmann was a member of the committees on culture, Bevölkerungspolitik and Ostmarkfragen (concerning the easternmost parts of Prussia, mainly the Province of Posen). She was re-elected via her party's electoral list when the first Landtag of Prussia was elected in 1921 and remained a member of parliament until her death. Death and legacy Poehlmann died on 25 December 1923 in her home town of Tilsit. In an obituary, the women's rights activist Else Frobenius honoured Poehlmann as \\"a woman, who has brought the modern parliamentarian respect and recognition\\".

According to RDI's Values Statement \\"The core principles of liberal democracy that once defined a centrist political majority across the free world are being pulled apart as once fringe views from the left and right gain public acceptance... There is still a center in Western politics, and it needs to be revitalized — intellectually, culturally, and politically.\\" In October 2018, RDI released its inaugural publication, Fight for Liberty: Defending Democracy in the Age of Trump. Taking inspiration from The Federalist Papers, the book features a collection of essays by contributors allied with RDI.

Early life and education Sotheby was born at Clifton, Bristol, the second son of Admiral of the Blue Thomas Sotheby (1759–1831), and his second wife, Lady Mary Anne (d. 1830), fourth daughter of Joseph Bourke, 3rd Earl of Mayo and Archbishop of Tuam. The poet William Sotheby (1757–1833) was his uncle and Rear-Admiral Charles Sotheby his cousin. He was from the southern branch of the famed Sotheby family from Yorkshire, which found success as auctioneers. He attended the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, entering the Royal Navy on 3 August 1826, aged 13. Career Sotheby passed the Royal Navy examination in 1832 before going to sea. He was commissioned as a lieutenant, 3 October 1835. He served on during the 1840 operations off the coast of Syria during the Egyptian–Ottoman War. For his services during the conflict, he was promoted to commander on 30 October 1841. He saw conflict again on Dido in 1842 during the First Opium War, when the British unleashed \\"gunboat diplomacy\\" to defeat the Chinese. In 1846–1847, he commanded against the Māori in the New Zealand Wars. In 1850, he took command of and exerted himself in the suppression of the slave trade along the west coast of Africa. He was promoted to captain in September 1852. From 1855–1858, Sotheby was captain of , a 21-gun screw corvette which he commanded in the Pacific Ocean, China, and India. While on route to India for the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Pearl rescued the crew of the wrecked transport HMS Transit, which wrecked off Bangka Island, Sumatra. Sotheby was called to shore and took command of the Pearls Naval Brigade for 10 months. For his assistance in suppressing the Indian uprising, Sotheby received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament, the Governor-General of India, the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, and the Naval and Military Commanders-in-Chief in India for services rendered. In 1860, Sotheby was captain of the battleship , a 101-gun screw-propelled first-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy. He served in the English Channel until late 1861, when Conqueror was despatched to carry troops supporting the French intervention in Mexico. On 29 December 1861, the ship was wrecked on the reefs of Rum Cay, in the Bahamas, without loss of life. It was determined the master failed to allow for the local currents. When Sotheby was brought to court-martial, he argued that the captain was not responsible for the navigation of the ship, which was the role of the master. The court accepted Sotheby's argument and admonished the master. However, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Alexander Milne, 1st Baronet disagreed with the outcome of the court-martial and successfully wrote a letter to the Admiralty, in which he not only attributed the loss of Conqueror to carelessness, but blaming Sotheby personally for his failure to supervise the master. On 20 March 1862, the Admiralty reconsidered the court case and revised the regulations by placing the ultimate responsibility for a ship's safety on the captain. After the court case, Sotheby had no further commands in the Royal Navy. In 1863, he commanded the Portland coastguard division, his final command. Sotheby was made a rear-admiral on 1 September 1867, a vice- admiral on 25 August 1873, and an admiral in June 1879. He retired from active service on 1 April 1870. After his retirement, Sir Edward devoted himself to his philanthropic work for the blind. For many years, he was chairman of the Blind Institute in Tottenham. In 1886, he was made a commissioner for investigating and reporting on the condition of the blind. Honours For his role in suppressing the Indian uprising, Sotheby and his brigade were mentioned in dispatches 13 times. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) and an extra aide de camp to Queen Victoria (1858–67). In the 1875 Birthday Honours, he was promoted to a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). Personal life Sotheby married Lucy Elizabeth Adeane, third daughter of Henry John Adeane and granddaughter of Lord Stanley of Alderley. They had three sons: William Edward Southwell Sotheby, Alfred Frederick Sotheby, and Herbert George Sotheby. Sir Edward died at his home at 26 Green Street, Mayfair, aged 88.

Early life  Baybulatov was born in 1912 to a Chechen peasant family in the village of Osmanyurt, then part of the Russian Empire. Due to an order from above discouraging commanders from nominating Vainakh peoples for the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, his nationality was listed as Kumyk in official Soviet documents. In 1938 he graduated from Grozny Pedagogical School, after which he worked as a school principal in his home village.  Second World War  Immediately after the launch of operation Barbarossa, Baybulatov was drafted into the Soviet Army. He trained at the officer at the Buynaksk Infantry School, which he graduated from in 1942. In January 1943 he was deployed as a platoon commander of in the 690th Rifle Regiment. During the battle for one village he led his machine gunners in repelling attacks from the German Army to break out of an encirclement. During the battle he took over the roles of his injured comrades, and was seriously injured while repelling an attack; he was mistakenly believed to be dead and a death notice was sent to his family. However, he was alive and survived his injuries after being taken to a hospital. For his courage in that engagement he was awarded the Order of the Red Star. He was able to return to his regiment after recovering from his injuries. By the time Baybulatov was promoted as commander of the 1st Rifle Battalion within his regiment, the entire 126th Rifle Division was engaged in heavy fighting for the control of Melitopol. During the fighting in autumn his battalion became one of the first to reach the city, doing so under the cover of tanks. After breaking through the outskirts of the city he led his battalion in the advance and clearing the city of Axis forces. In late October they were fighting to expel German forces from the central part of the city, street by street. From 19 to 23 October Baybulatov killed over 20 axis soldiers and took out two enemy tanks; during that time his battalion took out seven tanks, killed about 1,000 axis soldiers, repelled 19 counterattacks, and suppressed 19 firing points. He was killed in action less than a week before he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.

He likely began construction on this house in 1841, finishing it in time for his daughter's wedding in 1842 to George S. Wright, a businessman and banker who had arrived in Marshall in 1835. In 1849, the Pratts moved on to Niles, Michigan, where Daniel died ten years later. When they left Marshall, they left the house to their daughter and son-in-law, the Wrights. George Wright continued to work at a bank until his retirement. Afterward, he moved away from Marshall, leaving the house to his son. George Wright died in 1893. The house remained in the Wriht family until 1934, when it was purchased by preservationist Harold C. Brooks.

He played in 28 Ice Hockey World Championships with the Bulgaria men's national ice hockey team, and three IIHF Inline Hockey World Championships with the Bulgaria men's national inline hockey team, then retired from international play at age 51. His lengthy international career was recognized by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) in 2019, as a recipient of the Torriani Award. Early life Mihailov was born on 22 May 1964, in Sofia, People's Republic of Bulgaria, and has a twin brother named Boris. The brothers started playing hockey at age 14, and learned on the outdoor Druzhba rink in Sofia. Their father Simeon played hockey until he was 40 years old, and wanted his boys to play as wingers, but Konstantin dreamed of being a goaltender. He innovated equipment for the position by reusing old hockey pants, and constructing a trapper and blocker. He also carried his own tools to fix goaltending equipment, since teams did not have a dedicated equipment manager then. He is credited as being the first Bulgarian to train specifically as a goaltender, and used tennis balls to develop his eye–hand coordination. Club hockey career Mihailov had a lengthy professional ice hockey career mostly in the Bulgarian Hockey League, and two single seasons in Turkey and France. He played with HC Levski Sofia for twenty seasons from 1984 to 2004, which included a brief appearance with the Turkish Istanbul Paten Kulübü for part of the 2002–03 season. He played the 2004–05 season with the Galaxians d'Amneville in the French Ice Hockey Federation Division 2, then returned to Bulgaria. He played with Akademika Sofia from 2005 to 2007, HC Slavia Sofia from 2007 to 2012, HC CSKA Sofia from 2012 to 2014, and with Irbis-Skate Sofia from 2015 to 2019. He was named the best goaltender in the Bulgarian Hockey League during the 1991–92, 2011–12, and 2012–13 seasons; and was also named the best goaltender in Group A of the 2013–14 IIHF Continental Cup. International career Mihailov first represented his country on the international level with the Bulgaria men's national under-18 ice hockey team. During the 1982 IIHF European U18 Championship Group B tournament hosted in Sofia, he was named the best goaltender at the event. He later played for the Bulgaria men's national junior ice hockey team at the 1983 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, and the 1984 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Mihailov made his debut with the Bulgaria men's national ice hockey team during the 1985 World Ice Hockey Championships Group C tournament in Megève, France. He went on to play in 28 Ice Hockey World Championships with Bulgaria, which concluded with the 2014 IIHF World Championship Division III, at age 49. During this time, he also played in three Winter Olympic Games qualifying tournaments in 2004, 2008, and 2015. Mihailov later said that he played as long he did for the love for the game, and there was nobody as good as him in Bulgaria. His career was extended in 2009, with the unexpected death of his successor, Kiril Vajarov. He was named the best goaltender at both Group C of the 1990 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships, and the 2006 IIHF World Championship Division II. He led Bulgaria to a silver medal at the 2006 IIHF World Championship Division II, a bronze medal at the 2012 IIHF World Championship Division II, and the gold medal at the 2014 IIHF World Championship Division III. Mihailov also played for the Bulgaria men's national inline hockey team at three IIHF Inline Hockey World Championships, and said that there was \\"not a big difference between ice hockey and inline hockey\\". During the European qualification portion of the 2015 IIHF Inline Hockey World Championship Division I, Mihailov was given a standing ovation and was named the event's best goaltender. He was 51 years old at the time, which was his last appearance with the national team. Later life Mihailov became a goaltender coach in Bulgaria after retiring from playing, with the goal of someone having more success than him. He remained active playing amateur hockey, and has a son who played as a professional goaltender. Mihailov was honored by the IIHF in 2019, as a recipient of the Torriani Award to recognize his international hockey career. The formal ceremony took place on 26 May 2019 at the 2019 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships in Bratislava.

The octagonal baptistery stands at a slight angle across a small piazza from the Duomo of Pistoia in the center of town. It is presently used for cultural events. Description A likely centralized Lombard-era church of Santa Maria in Corte in front of the Cathedral is mentioned in documents from 1114 and was likely the site of this baptistery. The decision to build this mainly Gothic-style building was made in 1303. The exterior sheath banded with marble of two colors was completed circa 1339 by Cellino di Nese. Construction lasted many decades. The baptismal font is large and circular and contained in a block with four smaller circular basins; the floral panels were sculpted in 1226 by Lanfranco da Como. The portal has some bas-reliefs and sculptures (John the Baptist, Virgin and child, and St Peter) in the architrave by a sculptor working in the style of Giovanni d'Agostino. A sculpture of St John the Baptist by Andrea Vacca is housed inside.Comune of Pistoia, short entry. The baptistery has a pulpit facing outside to the piazza.

It was the largest solar facility in the state when it came online in December, 2015. The power is being sold under a 20-year power purchase agreement to Rocky Mountain Power which serves customers in Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. Project details The project takes advantage of the abundant sunshine at a cool high elevation of over 6,000 feet in the Parowan Valley. It is located on 632 acres of private land close to an existing Rocky Mountain Power substation. The project includes a visitor's center named for the late Dennis Stowell, a state senator who represented Iron County. The project was developed by the Norwegian firm Scatec Solar starting in 2011, and was originally estimated to cost up to $500 million. Google and Prudential Capital eventually came online as investors in the project in late 2014 with tax equity and debt financing support; with Google and Scatec Solar to retain joint ownership of the completed facility. Construction was anticipated to create approximately 120 to 200 jobs, of which 80% were to be local. Construction began in December 2014, and completed in December 2015. Swinerton Renewable Energy served as the EPC contractor. The total investment in the completed facility has been estimated at $188 million (much less than when planning started in 2011 due to the substantial drop in PV panel prices). The 340,784 modules are expected to produce 210 million kilowatt hours of electricity each year, enough to supply about 18,500 homes. On December 29, 2016 it was announced that Scatec Solar had sold its ownership interest in the operating facility to the Australian Macquarie Group.

It was perpetrated by Volunteer Cossack-Stamm-Regiment 5, part of the Freiwilligen-Stamm-Division, in 12–21 July 1944 during Operation Treffenfeld. It was part of a wider German anti-partisan offensive against the French Maquis de l'Ain et du Haut-Jura, which staged a massive uprising in mid-1944 along with other French resistance groups. Background Resistance activity in German-occupied France increased significantly in 1944 after the Allied landings in Normandy. Various Maquis units staged uprisings throughout France, capturing villages and fighting the German occupiers. German units feared the imminent Allied landing in Southern France and ramped up anti-partisan operations to recapture and control the French countryside. One of the planned offensives was Operation Treffenfeld, a large-scale offensive aimed at destroying the French resistance of the Maquis de l'Ain et du Haut-Jura. This group had been active in the Ain department for years and had its stronghold around the city of Oyonnax. They conducted widespread sabotage actions against the German infrastructure in the region, and German efforts had been mostly unsuccessful at nullifying the threat. The massacre The German offensive against the French Maquis was mostly successful and they advanced through the Jura Mountains with great speed. The Germans proceeded with utmost brutality; French civilians were frequently accused of being partisan sympathizers and executed on the spot. The village of Dortan is just a few kilometers from Oyonnax. On 12 July the Volunteer Cossack-Stamm-Regiment 5 of the Freiwilligen-Stamm-Division, an Ostlegion unit of volunteers from occupied USSR territory fighting for the Wehrmacht, approached the village. After arrival, the village was declared a \\"bandit center\\" (Banditenzentrum) and widespread looting commenced. Seven people, including the local priest, were shot immediately. The next day, killings continued in what the Germans described as \\"reprisal actions\\". The local women were systematically raped, and two of them murdered afterwards. 24 civilians were killed the first two days. The Wehrmacht established a local headquarters in the town to coordinate their operations in the nearby countryside. On 20 July, sixteen men from the nearby Château de Dortan were arrested and tortured. The next day, the Germans proceeded to burn the entire village down to the ground. More people were executed, bringing the final death toll to about 35. The Germans left the town in ruins. Aftermath The village was rebuilt after the war and a street was named after the events of the 21 July. A monument has been erected to honour the victims of the killings. Several plaques and other memorials remind of the massacre.

Inventions In 1901, Louis Nafis obtained a patent (US684850A) for a tool to verify the accuracy of the graduated scale on the neck of the standard Babcock bottle. It consisted of two slender metal cylinders connected lengthwise by a thin rod and topped by a wire handle. The device was supposed to be inserted into the neck of the bottle, previously filled with water to the \\"0%\\" mark. As the two cylinders were pushed into the liquid, its level on the neck, if correctly graduated, should rise to the \\"4%\\" and to the \\"8%\\" mark, respectively. In 1917, the Louis F. Nafis company was awarded a patent (US1261451) for a special caliper to measure the distance between graduations of the Babcock bottle. The inventor was listed as Jerome T. Smith of Scotland, South Dakota. In 1918, Louis and his wife Mabel were granted a patent (US1275723) for a color scale enclosed in a glass tube for protection against soiling, to be used in visual evaluations of colors — such as the yellow tones of various kinds of butter, or litmus tests of acidity.

Instead of the integral long graduated neck, it had a short neck to which a rubber ring was fitted. After processing and centrifuging the milk in the bottom part, two other glass parts would be added. A wider glass tube would be hermetically fitted on the outer edge of that ring, and inside it would be placed a narrow graduated tube, with a flared opening at bottom, resting on the rubber ring without a seal. Warm water would be poured down between the two tubes, seep under the inner tube, and lift the fat into the latter.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. The design was originally marketed by the manufacturer just as the Stiletto, but later became the Stiletto 27 to differentiate it from the later 1983 Stiletto 30 and 1985 Stiletto 23 designs. Production The design was built by Stiletto Catamarans (a division of Force Engineering) in the United States. A total of 500 were built, but it is now out of production. Design The Stiletto 27 is a recreational catamaran, built predominantly of fiberglass, with an epoxy and Nomex core. It has a fractional sloop rig with a full-roach mainsail, raked stems, slightly reverse transoms, transom-hung rudders controlled by a tiller and a single, centrally-mounted daggerboard keel. The racing versions are heavier and incorporate extra sails, sheet winches ans a 6:1 downhaul. A spinaker and pivoting centerboard are optional for both cruising and racing versions. The boat has a draft of with the daggerboard extended and with it retracted, allowing beaching or ground transportation on a trailer. For ground transport the design collapses to a width of . Both hulls have double berths, while the port hull houses the portable head. The starboard hull houses the galley. Further sleeping space can be created with the use of a deck tent. Access to each hull is via the raised Lexan skylight, which are slid forward for access. Additional portlights are in the hull sides, two per hull. The boat is normally fitted with a small outboard motor for docking and maneuvering. Roller furling headsails are optional. Other factory options include jiffy reefing, a halyard winch, jib sheet winches and a reduced-area cruising mainsail. The design has a hull speed of . Operational history In an account in Sail magazine published on May 1982, writer Robby Robinson describes the design's performance, \\"I was pleasantly surprised at Stiletto’s maneuverability. She is heavy enough (1,100 pounds) to have some carry, and the centerline daggerboard helps her spin quite nimbly from one tack to the other. Her high aspect rudders stall somewhat, especially if you're attempting to bear off without much way on. Still, she responds to sheet adjustment and rudder wriggling better than most boats, and her rapid acceleration is a real plus in tight quarters.\\" Variants ;Stiletto 27 :This model was designed by Bill Higgins and Don Ansley and introduced in 1976.

Album release When Columbia/Legacy approached Watt about releasing the album he was initially hesitant and suggested the label contact the other musicians to see how they felt about the idea. Watt was afraid some of the others would be embarrassed to have an album from twenty years earlier released. \\"It turns out they weren't embarrassed.

Riding for the Atari 8-bit family. Having strong similarities to Konami's 1981 Scramble arcade game, it was published in 1982 as the first release from UK-based English Software. The company proclaimed the game \\"Very, very, difficult!\\" in magazine advertisements, and reviewers agreed with that sentiment. Airstrike was followed by Airstrike II, also programmed by Riding, in 1983. Gameplay The player controls a ship that flies horizontally to the right through caverns. Pressing the joystick button fires a laser, and the space bar drops a bomb. As in Scramble, fuel is limited, but can be replenished by shooting marked targets. Airstrike also restricts ammunition; the ship starts with 40 shots and 10 bombs, and more are gained by destroying ammo dumps. Missiles on the terrain below launch up toward the ship and can be destroyed when either on the ground or in the air. There are five difficulty settings. Reception In a 1982 review for Electronic Games, Bill Kunkel wrote, \\"The graphics are absolutely top-notch, perhaps the finest recreation of the sort of coin-op which inspired Airstrike in the first place.\\" He concluded, \\"With Airstrike, English Software shows it can produce coin-op look-alikes with the best of them. A new game, however, with a more original play concept, would establish this company as one of the best software producers around.\\" Walter Salm wrote in Electronic Fun with Computers & Games: \\"If you're looking for a good home version of Scramble, this is one of the best I've sen yet\\" and \\"it's hard as the devil to play–even at the easiest skill level.\\" He mentioned pressing the space bar to drop a bomb as a flaw. In a COMPUTE! review in 1983, James V. Trunzio disliked that after the player's ship is destroyed, \\"the next one appears so fast that there is little time to regroup.\\" His overall opinion was that, \\"Airstrike is exactly what it claims to be—a very demanding program.\\" The Book of Atari Software 1983 called the game, \\"nearly impossible to play even on the easiest level,\\" putting part of the blame on the sensitivity of the controls. John J. Anderson covered Airstrike in a \\"Five Great Games for the Atari\\" roundup: \\"The graphics in this package are fair, though the multicolor character graphics look a bit blocky to me.\\" He concluded, \\"In all, a good, but not excellent, effort.\\" See also *Caverns of Mars *The Tail of Beta Lyrae References External links * Category:1982 video games Category:Atari 8-bit family games Category:Atari 8-bit family-only games Category:Horizontally scrolling shooters Category:Video game clones Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ","title":"Airstrike (video game)"},{"id":"60211676","text":"Saros or Sarus () was a city and polis (city-state) of ancient Greece on the island of the same name.

He was the son of an attorney at the supreme court, and deputy mayor of Copenhagen. From the age of thirteen as a cadet in the Danish-Norwegian navy, he rose through the ranks to vice admiral in 1775 and full admiral in 1790. He died 17 June 1797 and was buried in the Holmens Kirkegård, the Danish naval cemetery, in Copenhagen. Early career As a junior lieutenant, Fisker saw service in the British navy from 1739 to 1742, and again as a senior lieutenant from 1744 to 1746. In 1753, as captain of the armed merchant ship Friderich og Lovise, he was sent to reinforce the Danish squadron off Morocco and at the same time carry the diplomat Andreas Æreboe to the area. From service in the West Indies as captain of the frigate Docquen in 1755 - 1756, he then took the ship-of-the-line Neptunus to the Mediterranean and Constantinople. 1761 In 1761 he was again in the Mediterranean, this time with ship-of-the-line Grønland including a team of scientists on board. (His 9-year-old son Lorentz was also on board, at the start of an equally illustrious career, but fell ill and was left to convalesce on Malta).Topsøe- Jensen vol I pp 373-377 In November of that year a merchant ship in a convoy escorted by Grønland was captured by a British warship, in consequence of which Fisker gave up command of his ship and travelled back to Denmark overland from the Mediterranean to face a court martial. He was acquitted of any professional wrongdoing. Later career In 1766, while captain of the ship-of-the-line Prins Friderich he was adjutant to the head of the Danish navy. 1770 he was at the Admiralty college, and in 1773 he was in overall command of the flotilla which carried Prince Carl of Hessen and Princess Louise to Norway, where Fisker was the most senior naval officer. From 1775 to 1780 he was commanding officer of Frederiksværn naval dockyard (modern day Stavern) and of the Norwegian flotilla. On return to Denmark, Fisker was engaged in several important commissions, including that concerning the introduction of gunboats for near coastal defence, as well as being chairman of that covering the Norwegian flotilla. He also served as presiding officer over a number of courts martial References Citations * (accessed 2019) * (Danish-Norwegian Naval Officers) Two volumes. Download here.

This virus was first isolated from Miniopterus schreibersii, in the western Caucasus Mountains of southeastern Europe in 2002. WCBL is the most divergent form of Lyssavirus, and is found in Miniopterus bats (insectivorous) , Rousettus aegyptiacus, and Eidolon helvum. The latter two are both fruit bats. The virus is fragile as it can be inactivated by UV light and chemicals, such as ether, chloroform, and bleach. WCBL has not been known to infect humans thus far.  Classification  The lyssavirus genus can be divided into four phylogroups based upon DNA sequence homology. Phylogroup I includes viruses, such as Rabies virus, Duvenhage virus, European bat lyssavirus types 1 and 2, Australian bat lyssavirus, Khujand virus, Bokeloh bat lyssavirus, Irkut virus, and Aravan virus. Phylogroup II contains Lagos bat virus, Mokola virus, and Shimoni bat virus. West Caucasian bat lyssavirus is the only virus that is a part of phylogroup III. Ikoma lyssavirus and Lleida bat lyssavirus are examples in phylogroup IV. West Caucasian bat lyssavirus was classified within its own phylogroup because it is the most divergent lyssavirus that has been discovered.  Discovery  This image shows an example of the structure of a negative sense single stranded RNA virus with a glycoprotein. Rabies viruses were found in bats as far back as 1954 in Germany. However, until a bat worker in Finland died as a result of rabies in 1985, few cases had been noted. Increased surveillance and documentation in the 1986 and 1987 revealed several additional cases. These virus strains mostly consisted of European bat lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1) and European bat lyssavirus type 2 (EBLV-2). From 1977 to 2011, 961 cases of rabies were reported in Europe. 91% were EBLV-1. The rest of the cases were suspected to be EBLV-2 and all but 3 have been confirmed. The 3 unconfirmed cases resulted in the discovery of West Caucasian bat lyssavirus (WCBL) in southwest Russia in 2002 and the Bokeloh bat lyssavirus in Germany in 2010.  Virus structure  West Caucasian bat lyssavirus (WCBL) is a bullet shaped negative sense single stranded RNA virus. WCBL is composed of an internal helical nucleocapsid and a lipid envelope derived from the host cell. The virus contains knobbed spikes that protrude from the membrane to aid in host membrane fusion. In addition, WCBL, along with other lyssaviruses, has a glycoprotein which is important in mediating viral entry.  Virus genome  This is an image of the genome of West Caucasian bat lyssavirus, which comprises five main genes: N, P, M, G, and L. The WCBL contains a linear genome that is 12,278 base pairs in length and comprises five main genes, denoted N, P, M, G, and L. Gene N encodes for the nucleoprotein, P encodes for the phosphoprotein, M encodes for matrix proteins, G encodes for the glycoprotein, and L encodes for the polymerase. WCBL must encode for an RNA- dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in its genome in order for viral replication and synthesis to occur because it is a negative single-strand RNA virus. In comparison to other lyssaviruses, WCBL has a shorter trailer region of 57 nucleotides (as opposed to 69-70), but a longer non-coding region specifically in the glycoprotein gene at 697 nucleotides. These differences have resulted in its classification into its own phylogroup. The West Caucasian bat lyssavirus also contains an open reading frame within the G gene which led researchers to believe parts of the glycoprotein were transcribed independently. However, a lack of a transcription initiation signal near the internal open reading frame has since confirmed that the glycoprotein is not transcribed in separate segments.  Replication cycle and interaction with the host  The replication cycle for WCBL has not been specifically studied; however, it is said to be very similar to that of general lyssavirus, so the information listed below is regarding the genus as a whole.  Entry into cell  In order for lyssaviruses to enter into a host cell, the virus must attach to the host cell’s receptor. This process is facilitated by the viral glycoprotein. Researchers are still unaware of the specific receptor the WCBL virus uses to gain entry into the host cell. Upon receptor activation, clathrin mediated endocytosis is provoked in which the cell absorbs the contents of the virus, including proteins. Next, the virus fuses to the vesicle membrane, allowing the viral nucleocapsid to enter into the cytoplasm of the host cell. The phosphoprotein of WCBL can attach to cytoplasmic dynein LC8 for transport to the nucleus for viral replication.  Replication and transcription  Next, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) binds to the RNA genome and transcribes the five viral genes. In other words, the DNA is copied into a new strand of mRNA that will then hijack host cell translational machinery to synthesize proteins. Viral mRNA is capped and polyadenylated, which is the attachment of a string of adenine nucleotides to the 3’ end of the protein. The adenylation increases the half-life of the protein in order to regulate the activity.  Assembly and release  Further, assembly of the virus starts when there is enough nucleoprotein (N) to encapsulate the genome. The virus is then released into non-nervous tissue. It is not easily detected due to the fact that it does not stimulate the immune system immediately. The incubation period can last anywhere from a few days to several months. After this time frame, it can move into the peripheral nervous system (PNS), and can eventually travel to the central nervous system (CNS) via the axonal transport system. At that point, it is possible to see clinical signs, such as weakness and lethargy due to encephalitis. Death often results several days after symptoms emerge.  Associated diseases  The WCBL virus is closely related to rabies. Although, WCBL has not yet infected humans, there is great risk due to its similar structure to other lyssaviruses which are known to infect humans. Unfortunately, the current rabies vaccine is not effective against WCBL as a result of the WCBL’s slight divergence from other lyssaviruses. Therefore, if this virus begins to infect humans, the rabies vaccine will need to be improved to include effective antibodies for WCBL.  Tropism  WCBL initially infects muscle tissue in the bats. As the virus progresses, it moves into the nervous tissue in both the PNS and CNS. Although no studies have been completed thus far on the mammalian tropism of the WCBL virus, tropism for another more recently discovered lyssavirus, Australian Bat Lyssavirus (ABLV) has been explored. A variety of mammalian cell types including rabbits, other small rodents, monkeys, horses, and humans have shown to be permissive to ABVL. This led researchers to believe that the receptor of entry is likely conserved across several mammalian species. More research is necessary to determine if a variety of mammalian cell types are also permissive to WCBL virus.  Outbreaks  There have been a few cases of outbreaks of WCBL. One was noted in Russia in 2002, which is the year that the virus was isolated. A possible outbreak was noted in Kenya in 2008.  Susceptibility and pathogenesis in bats  In order to gain an understanding of the susceptibility and pathogenesis of the West Caucasian bat lyssavirus (WCBL), big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) were inoculated with the virus intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle, in the neck, or orally. Blood and saliva samples were taken during disease progression and tissue samples were analyzed post-mortem. Specific tissues of interest included the brain, salivary glands, brown fat, lung, kidney, and bladder. Three bats died during the lethargic stage of viral infection (days 10 to 18), all of which were inoculated in the neck. Of those that died, only the tissue samples from the brain contained the infectious virus. However, both lung and salivary gland tissue contained viral RNA. Two of the three bats had viral RNA present in the bladder and in brown fat tissue as well. None of these three bats had viral RNA present in the kidney. All bats that survived were euthanized at 6 months. No viral particles were detected in the brain and salivary gland tissue samples of these bats. Of all the bats surveyed, only one of the three that died from viral infection had viral RNA present in the saliva at the time of death. WCBL antibodies were found in the serum of 4 of 7 bats that received intramuscular inoculation from a few weeks post-inoculation to the end of observation at 6 months. Those that died as a result of infection did not have any WCBL antibodies, a likely result of a shorter incubation period experienced from neck inoculation. None of the bats inoculated orally developed a serological response or the disease. This study indicates that the progression of WCBL infection is dependent on the location of inoculation. Further research is needed to develop a more complete understanding of inoculation route, pathogen adaptation, and host response.

The book discusses research on meditation. For the book, the authors conducted a literature review of over 6,000 scientific studies on meditation, and selected the 60 that they believed met the highest methodological standards. Summary The authors write that meditation can be practised at two levels: the \\"deep path\\" of intensive meditative discipline aiming for total self-transformation, and the \\"wide path\\" of less intensive practice that can reach a larger number of people. The book discusses both these levels, with findings on the highest-level meditators toward the end of the book. After attending meditation retreats in Asia and while graduate students together at Harvard in the 1970s, Goleman and Davidson formulated the hypothesis that \\"the after is the before for the next during\\"—meaning the changes that endure after the end of a meditation session contribute to a more equanimous starting point for the next meditation session. Such lasting psychological changes, or altered traits, are the focus of the book, as opposed to altered states of consciousness during meditation that end along with the meditation session. The authors explain a range of methodological obstacles to studying meditation scientifically, which have resulted in many flawed studies; they write that based on an exhaustive literature review by Davidson's research group, they selected only studies they deemed to meet the highest standards to use in the book. The authors write that meditation leads to reduced stress reactivity, for instance that 30 hours of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) practice leads to reduced amygdala activation and that long-term meditation practice increases connectivity between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the amygdala. Regarding compassion, they distinguish between cognitive empathy, emotional empathy, and empathic concern, the last of which results in action to help reduce suffering, and state that as little as eight hours of loving-kindness meditation can increase empathic concern. They write that meditation is at its core about retraining attention, and discuss studies showing that a small amount of meditation can improve attention in the short- term (as reflected, for instance, in a shorter attentional blink) while long- term practice brings lasting improvement. Next, the authors turn to the sense of self, reflected in the self-referential and often unpleasant mind-wandering of the brain's default mode network, writing that in early meditation practice brain circuits inhibit its activity and that in later practice activity in the network itself decreases. While they state that meditation was not originally developed to treat illness, it does appear to have some beneficial effects in this regard, including reducing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines—though they say these are not yet well understood. Meditation was likewise not designed to treat psychopathology, but they note (among other findings) that a meta-analysis of 47 studies found meditation equally effective to medication for treating depression, anxiety, and pain, without medication's negative side effects. The next chapter recounts how Davidson's lab, with the help of French Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard, recruited yogis including Mingyur Rinpoche in order to study the neurological effects of high-level meditation, and—in a much-cited study—found substantial surges in both electrical activity (using EEG) and activity in the brain's circuits for empathy (using fMRI) when Mingyur meditated on compassion. The authors write that experienced yogis have much higher levels of gamma waves, that they show little anticipation of pain and a very fast recovery from it, and that they can re-focus and hold their attention with little effort. The authors then summarize the benefits of meditation they have so far described for three levels of practice: beginner, long-term, and \\"Olympic-level.\\" In the last chapter, the authors discuss possible new applications of meditation research, and remind their readers of the paucity of reliable data on meditation when they first became interested in the 1970s compared to the large and growing evidence base available now. Reception A book review for Psych Central praises the book for avoiding the common sensationalism on the topic while exploring important research. It states: \\"In their new book, [...] recognized experts in their fields and lifelong meditators Daniel Goleman and Richard J. Davidson reveal the data that demonstrate just what meditation can and can’t do.\\" UC Berkeley's Greater Good Magazine gave a strongly positive review of the book. It describes Altered Traits as \\"a highly readable book that helps readers separate the wheat from the chaff of mindfulness science\\" and which makes \\"a cogent argument that meditation, in various forms, has the power to transform us not only in the moment, but in more profound, lasting ways.\\" The review also states that \\"Davidson and Goleman dutifully report the counter evidence as well.\\" The book received a more critical review in the journal NeuroRegulation. The review gives a list of noteworthy research findings and methodological contributions for future research, and acknowledges the obstacles faced by scientists working in fields that are not fully accepted. However, in a concluding note it cautions: \\"From an academic point of view, even this book and the research shared adds up to a set of questionable empirical evidence that at times clearly lacks impartiality.\\" A review in New Scientist compares the book with Thomas Joiner's book Mindlessness, which argues that mindfulness meditation has been oversold. The review calls Altered Traits \\"much needed\\" while dismissing Joiner's criticism of mindfulness as misplaced. An article on Mindful.org comments that \\"when you weed out the studies that don’t meet the highest scientific standards, as Goleman and Davidson have done in their book, a clear picture emerges of what we know about the science of meditation—and what we still need to learn.\\" See also * Mind and Life Institute * Francisco Varela * Mindfulness * Brain activity and meditation * Neuroplasticity * Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) * Buddhism and psychology * Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion by Sam Harris * Why Buddhism is True by Robert Wright References External links * Talks at Google: Goleman and Davidson discuss Altered Traits * LinkedIn Speaker Series: Goleman and Davidson discuss Altered Traits * Goleman and Davidson discuss Altered Traits and related topics with Sam Harris * Goleman and Davidson discuss Altered Traits on ABC Radio's 10% Happier podcast Category:2017 non-fiction books Category:Literary collaborations ","title":"Altered Traits"},{"id":"60211972","text":"Christina Schweinberger (born 29 October 1996) is an Austrian professional racing cyclist, who currently rides for UCI Women's Continental Team .

She is an Indologist whose research interests include Sanskrit language and literature, Buddhism, Hinduism, Tantrism and yoga studies. Her work has especially attracted the interest of scholars working on South Asian iconography and ritual and of scholars of the emerging discipline of Yoga Studies for her discovery of early illustrated manuscripts showing sets of 84 asanas. Life Gudrun Bühnemann was born in Germany. She obtained her PhD in Classical Indian and Buddhist Studies at the University of Vienna. She spent extended periods of time as a post-doctoral researcher at Pune University in India and at Nagoya University and Kyoto University in Japan. Her research has been supported by fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the American Council of Learned Societies, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and the German Research Council, among other organizations. She has published numerous books on South Asian iconography and ritual. These often use material from previously unpublished manuscripts and from illustrated manuscripts. Reception Viparīta Karaṇī from an 1830 manuscript with 84 illustrations of the Joga Pradīpikā, one of the texts discussed in Bühnemann's 2007 Eighty-Four Asanas in Yoga: A Survey of Traditions Sanjukta Gupta, reviewing her edited collection Mandalas and Yantras in the Hindu Tradition, calls the book \\"a wonderfully designed volume of essays\\" and praises Bühnemann with the words \\"The editor, Professor Gudrun Bühnemann, has already published excellent works on Hindu gods, rituals and iconography. This is no exception.\\" Richard Rosen calls Bühnemann's Eighty-Four Asanas in Yoga \\"comprehensive\\", and notes that the number 84 signifies completeness and sometimes sacredness. Mark Singleton notes of the same work that Bühnemann demonstrated that asanas had been illustrated from very early in the modern period, for instance in the Joga Pradīpikā, and that her study showed that standing poses were largely missing from hatha yoga. I. M. P. Raeside, reviewing her Puja: A Study in Smārta Ritual, calls it a very full study of the theory and practice of Puja in Hinduism, noting its value in describing three specific traditional pujas, countering in Raeslde's view \\"trendy pujas, which have only tenuous connexions with earlier Hindu rites\\". He notes that Bühnemann \\"has benefited throughout from a lengthy residence in Poona from 1982 to 1985\\" where she attended and discussed \\"many of these ceremonies\\".

Because of the wide variety of equipment classified as medical devices, the FDA has no single standard to which a specific device must be manufactured; instead they have created an encompassing guide that all manufacturers must follow. Manufacturers are required to develop comprehensive procedures within the FDA framework in order to produce a specific device to approved safety standards.  Pathway to Approval  The USFDA allows for two regulatory pathways that allow the marketing of medical devices. The first, and by far the most common is the so- called 510(k) clearance process (named after the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act section that describes the process). A new medical device that can be demonstrated to be \\"substantially equivalent\\" to a previously legally marketed device can be \\"cleared\\" by the FDA for marketing as long as the general and special controls as described below are met. The vast majority of new medical devices (99%) enter the marketplace via this process. The 510(k) pathway rarely requires clinical trials. The second regulatory pathway for new medical devices is the Premarket Approval process (PMA), described below, which is similar to the pathway for a new drug approval. Typically, clinical trials are required for this premarket approval pathway. Regulatory Controls General Controls General controls include provisions that relate to: * adulteration; * misbranding; * device registration and listing; * premarket notification; * banned devices; * notification, including repair, replacement, or refund; * records and reports; * restricted devices; and * good manufacturing practices. Special Controls Special controls were established for cases in which patient safety and product effectiveness are not fully guaranteed by general controls. Special controls may include special labeling requirements, mandatory performance standards and postmarket surveillance. Special controls are specific to each device and classification guides are available for various branches of medical devices. Premarket Approval Premarket Approval is a scientific review to ensure the device's safety and effectiveness, in addition to the general controls of Class I. Risk Classification Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recognizes three classes of medical devices, based on the level of control necessary to assure safety and effectiveness. The classification procedures are described in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, part 860 (usually known as 21 CFR 860). Devices are classified into three brackets: * Class I: General Controls; * Class II: General Controls and Special Controls; * Class III: General Controls and Premarket Approval. Regulations differ by class based on their complexity or the potential hazards in the event of malfunction. Class I devices are the least likely to cause major bodily harm or death in the event of failure, and are subjected to less stringent regulations than are devices categorized as Class II or Class III.  Class I: General controls  Class I devices are subject to the least regulatory control. Class I devices are subject to \\"General Controls\\" as are Class II and Class III devices. General controls are the only controls regulating Class I medical devices. They state that Class I devices are not intended to be: # For use in supporting or sustaining life; # Of substantial importance in preventing impairment to human life or health; and # May not present an unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Most Class I devices are exempt from premarket notification and a few are also exempted from most good manufacturing practices regulations. Examples of Class I devices include hand-held surgical instruments, (elastic) bandages, examination gloves, bed-patient monitoring systems, medical disposable bedding, and some prosthetics such as hearing aids.  Class II: General controls and special controls  Class II devices are those for which general controls alone cannot assure safety and effectiveness, and existing methods are available that provide such assurances. Devices in Class II are held to a higher level of assurance and subject to stricter regulatory requirements than Class I devices, and are designed to perform as indicated without causing injury or harm to patient or user. In addition to complying with general controls, Class II devices are also subject to special controls. Examples of Class II devices include acupuncture needles, powered wheelchairs, infusion pumps, air purifiers, and surgical drapes. A few Class II devices are exempt from the premarket notification.  Class III: General controls and premarket approval  A Class III device is one for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through the general or special controls sufficient for Class I or Class II devices. These devices are considered high-risk and are usually those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, pose a potential, unreasonable risk of injury or illness, or are of great significance in preventative care.. For these reasons, Class III devices require premarket approval. Prior to marketing a Class III device, the rights- holder(s) or person(s) with authorized access must seek FDA approval. The review process may exceed six months for final determination of safety by an FDA advisory committee. Many Class III devices have established guidelines for Premarket Approval (PMA) and increasingly, must comply with unique device identifier regulations. However, with ongoing technological advances many Class III devices encompass concepts not previously marketed, These devices may not fit the scope of established device categories and do not yet have developed FDA guidelines. Examples of Class III devices that currently require a premarket notification include implantable pacemaker, pulse generators, HIV diagnostic tests, automated external defibrillators, and endosseous implants.  Nanomanufacturing  Nanomanufacturing techniques provide a means of manufacturing cellular-scale medical devices (<100μm). They are particularly useful in the context of medical research, where cellular-scale sensors can be produced that provide high-resolution measurements of cellular-scale phenomena. Common techniques in the area are direct-write nanopatterning techniques such as dip-pen nanolithography, electron-beam photolithography and microcontact printing, directed self-assembly methods, and Functional Nanoparticle Delivery (NFP), where nanofountain probes deliver liquid molecular material that is drawn through nanopattern channels by capillary action.  Additive manufacturing  Additive manufacturing (AM) processes are a dominant mode of production for medical devices that are used inside the body, such as implants, transplants and prostheses, for their ability to replicate organic shapes and enclosed volumes that are difficult to fabricate. The inability of donation systems to meet the demand for organ transplantation in particular has led to the rise of AM in medical device manufacturing.  Biocompatibility  The largest issue in integrating AM techniques into medical device manufacturing is biocompatibility. These issues arise from the stability of 3D printed polymers in the body and the difficulty of sterilizing regions between printed layers. In addition to the use of primary cleaners and solvents to remove surface impurities, which are commonly isopropyl alcohol, peroxides, and bleach, secondary solvents must be use in succession to remove the cleaning chemicals applied before them, a problem that increases with the porosity of the material used. Common compatibility AM materials include nylon and tissue material from the host patient. Cybersecurity Many medical devices have either been successfully attacked or had potentially deadly vulnerabilities demonstrated, including both in-hospital diagnostic equipment and implanted devices including pacemakers and insulin pumps. On 28 December 2016 the US Food and Drug Administration released its recommendations that are not legally enforceable for how medical device manufacturers should maintain the security of Internet-connected devices.

It lay very close to Cults and Bieldside.  History  The station was opened in August 1894 as part of the Aberdeen suburban service on the Deeside branch and at first the branch services were operated by the Deeside Railway. Later the line became part of the GNoSR who opened West Cults and at grouping merged with the London and North Eastern Railway. West Cults is likely to have become an unstaffed halt circa 1930Disused Railway Stations and was closed to passengers on 5 April 1937 as a part of the withdrawal of the Aberdeen suburban service. The station probably became unstaffed at the same time as Murtle and Milltimber with the aforementioned closure of the Aberdeen suburban service. After its closure in 1937 the line itself remained open to Ballater until 1966. The line has been lifted and this sections forms part of the Deeside Way long distance footpath. Infrastructure The main wooden station building stood on the eastbound side with its 'hipped roof', had a waiting room, ticket office, staff accommodation and toilets, similar to those at Torphins, Lumphanan, Murtle and elsewhere on the line. It did not possess a goods yard, sidings or points on the double track line. A curling pond stood close by in Cults Park that would have attracted participating passengers on match days.Aberdeenshire LXXXVI.1 (Aberdeen; Banchory-Devenick; Peterculter) Publication date:1901 Revised:1899 The line had been doubled in 1892, a stone stationmasters house built, together with a wooden pedestrian overbridge, but no signal box and a small wooden shelter located on the westbound platform. The signals were operated by the stationmaster who had orders to put them at danger whilst a train was in the station. In 1908 the signals and ground frame were removed.

A number of Brunfelsia species have played important roles in the folk medicine of peoples indigenous to South America, having been used to treat conditions as diverse as syphilis, rheumatism, yellow fever and snakebite. The roots are the most effective parts of the plants and possess diuretic and sweat-inducing properties. Medications prepared from Brunfelsia species have the curious effect of producing the sensation of chills, this being the rationale for their folk use in the treatment of fevers.Schultes, Richard Evans; Hofmann, Albert (1979).

Rosemond is an American aquatic ecosystem ecologist, biogeochemist, and professor in the Odum School of Ecology at the University of Georgia. Rosemond studies how global change affects freshwater ecosystems, including effects of watershed urbanization, nutrient pollution, and changes in biodiversity on ecosystem function. She was elected an Ecological Society of America fellow in 2018, and has been elected to serve as the Society for Freshwater Science president from 2019-2020.  Education and early career  Rosemond grew up in Florida in the 1970s, where her love of nature was confronted by increasing human pressures on the environment. Rosemond earned her Bachelor of Sciences degree in zoology from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. She remained at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill to complete her Master of Arts degree in biology. Rosemond went on to earn a Ph.D. in biology at Vanderbilt University, where she was co-advised by Vanderbilt faculty Susan Brawley and Oak Ridge National Laboratory research scientist Patrick J. Mulholland. Rosemond conducted her dissertation research at the Oak Ridge National Lab, in Tennessee, USA, studying how both top-down predation and bottom-up nutrient availability affect periphyton in headwater streams. After completing her Ph.D. in 1993, Rosemond was awarded a National Science Foundation postdoctoral research fellowship in environmental biology. She completed her postdoc at the Institute of Ecology at the University of Georgia, during which she conducted research at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica examining the top-down and bottom-up effects of predatory fishes and shrimps and phosphorus, respectively, on leaf-litter breakdown and carbon processing. While working at La Selva, Rosemond also conducted research on landscape-scale variation in stream phosphorus concentrations, and its effects on stream detritivore food webs.  Career  Rosemond worked as the assistant director of the Institute of Ecology at the University of Georgia from 1998-2005. She became an assistant professor at the University of Georgia in 2005 in the Odum School of Ecology, an associate professor in 2011, and a professor in 2017. As of 2019, she has advised or co-advised 17 graduate students and three postdocs at Georgia. Broadly, Rosemond and her lab members research the mechanisms and processes that underlie aquatic ecosystem health and function, and seek to understand how stream and river health is altered by human activities and global change. This involves studying how different stressors, including excess nutrients and land-use change through urbanization, affect ecosystem processes.  Excess nutrients and stream ecosystem function  Leveraging partnerships with the Coweeta Hydrologic Lab long-term ecological research site, Rosemond and her colleagues have used whole-ecosystem experiments to understand how stream carbon stocks, benthic macroinvertebrates, and higher trophic levels, including salamanders, respond to nitrogen and phosphorus pollution. Her research in this area focuses on how terrestrially-derived detrital carbon, including leaves, sticks, and wood that fall into streams, is processed and transmitted through aquatic food webs that are exposed to excess nutrients. She has led research to test the relative importance of nitrogen and phosphorus limitation in stream carbon processing through whole-stream nutrient enrichment studies. Through this work, Rosemond and her collaborators have increased understanding of how nutrients affect energy flow in detritus-based food webs, as previous research on nutrient effects in streams often focused on photosynthetic, algal pathways.

Legislation for the half dollar passed both houses of Congress in 1930 but was vetoed by President Herbert Hoover. The House of Representatives sustained his action, 96 votes in favor of overriding it to 243 opposed, well short of the necessary two-thirds majority. This was the first veto of Hoover's presidency and the first ever for a commemorative coin bill. The proposal to commemorate the 1854 congressional ratification of the Gadsden Purchase was the brainchild of El Paso coin dealer Lyman W. Hoffecker, who wanted a commemorative coin he could control and distribute. He gained the support of several members of Congress from Texas and the Southwest, and a bill was introduced in Congress in April 1929, receiving a hearing 11 months later. Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon sent a letter and two officials in opposition to the bill, but it passed both houses of Congress without dissent. On April 21, 1930, Hoover vetoed the bill, deeming commemorative coins abusive. Although only one congressman spoke in favor of Hoover's action during the override debate in the House, the veto was easily sustained. No commemorative coins were struck during the remainder of the Hoover Administration. They resumed after Franklin D. Roosevelt was inaugurated, but by 1935 Roosevelt was citing Hoover's veto in urging Congress to avoid passing commemorative coin bills. He vetoed one in 1938. In 1946, Harry S. Truman adopted similar arguments in warning he would oppose further coin bills, and he vetoed one in 1947. Dwight D. Eisenhower vetoed three more in 1954. No non-circulating commemorative coins were struck from 1955 until after the Treasury Department changed its position in 1981.  Hearing  The Gadsden Purchase came as the result of negotiation between the U.S. minister to Mexico James Gadsden and Mexican president Antonio López de Santa Anna. Following the Mexican–American War, there were border disputes along the Mexican Cession left unresolved by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Specifically, Southerners in the United States sought land over which a southern route of a transcontinental railroad could run. Accordingly, U.S. President Franklin Pierce sent Gadsden to resolve these issues. The resulting treaty was signed on December 30, 1853. Initially, were to be conveyed in exchange for $15 million. But when the original treaty failed to pass the U.S. Senate, both the land and the payment were reduced by about a third. The Gadsden Purchase, west of El Paso, forms part of the states of Arizona and New Mexico. L.W. Hoffecker During the late 1920s, El Paso coin dealer Lyman W. Hoffecker tried hard to gain congressional approval for a half dollar commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Gadsden Purchase. In 1929, he founded the Gadsden Purchase Commission (essentially just Hoffecker himself). At the time, commemorative coins were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. Hoffecker wanted to be able to control the distribution of the Gadsden Purchase half dollars. The April 1929 issue of The Numismatist printed a letter from Hoffecker, who was said to have designed the proposed coin and would be responsible for its distribution. It stated that Texas Congressman Claude Benton Hudspeth of El Paso had agreed to introduce legislation for the Gadsden piece. Hoffecker related that the coin would have the portrait of Gadsden on its obverse and on its reverse a map of New Mexico and Arizona depicting the purchased lands and El Paso. Ten thousand coins were to be sought, to be issued at $1.50 (equivalent to $ in 2018) each. Hudspeth introduced a bill for a Gadsden Purchase half dollar into the House of Representatives on April 25, 1929; it was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. On January 29, 1930, committee chairman Randolph Perkins of New Jersey sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon, enquiring as to the Treasury's views. Mellon replied on the 31st, opposing the bill. He felt that Congress had wisely decided in 1890 that coin designs should not be changed more often than once in 25 years, and that the 15 commemorative coin bills passed since 1920 were wasteful and a burden on the Mint. He noted that in 1927, at the time of the Vermont Sesquicentennial half dollar, the Coinage Committee had gone on record in opposition of commemorative coin issues, many of which were only of local and not national significance. Several issues had failed to sell out, resulting in coins being returned to the Mint to be melted, and he suggested that a medal be issued instead of a coin. On March 8, Hoffecker sent a telegram to the committee offering to pay for the entire issue of 10,000 anytime the department wanted, and given that the Mint had produced over 30,000,000 coins for other nations in 1929, any burden posed by commemorative half dollars was slight. Hearings were held by the committee on the bill on March 10 (briefly) and 17, 1930, with Perkins presiding. On the 17th, Congressman Guinn Williams appeared on behalf of Hudspeth, who was ill. Williams, a Texan, stated that the coin issue was important to the entire Southwest, that proponents would not allow the government to incur any expense, and stated that they were ready to pay for the coins. He also presented a joint resolution of the houses of the Texas Legislature, asking the state's representatives to introduce and support a bill for a Gadsden Purchase half dollar. Next to speak was Albert Gallatin Simms of New Mexico, who assured the committee of his support for the bill, and that of his state's two senators. Hudspeth sent a letter, and his secretary Kate George told the committee that the senators from Texas, New Mexico and Arizona were unanimously in favor of the bill. Hudspeth's letter stated he had been told by Hoffecker's committee that the money from the coins would be used to set up a small monument where the U.S. flag had first been raised in the Gadsden Purchase. Mellon had sent two Treasury officials to the hearing, Assistant Secretary Walter E. Hope and Assistant Director of the Mint Mary M. O'Reilly. In his testimony, Hope warned that the issuance of commemorative half dollars was leading to confusion, and there was a risk of counterfeiting. Sales for some issues had not met expectations, resulting in many commemoratives being returned to the Mint for redemption and melting. O'Reilly told of a man who was about to be put off a Philadelphia streetcar, having only a commemorative half dollar to pay the fare, something not recognized by the conductor. He was allowed to remain after the superintendent of the Philadelphia Mint, also a passenger, paid his fare. Luther A. Johnson of Texas appeared in support of the bill, and presented a letter from Hoffecker dated March 5, stating that the coins could be easily sold, and that when his committee had met with President Herbert Hoover, the president had told them the event should be fittingly celebrated. After the testimony concluded, the Coinage Committee went into executive session and endorsed the bill.  Passage by Congress  Congressman Randolph Perkins Perkins's committee issued a report dated March 17, 1930, stating that the anniversary of the Gadsden Purchase was of international importance, and there was no risk to the Treasury given the willingness of Hoffecker to pay for the coins. On March 19, Perkins called up the bill before the House, and it passed without debate or dissent. Immediately thereafter, Perkins had another commemorative coin bill passed by the House, for the 300th anniversary of Massachusetts Bay Colony. In the Senate, the Gadsden bill was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. On April 2, the committee issued a report through Tom Connally of Texas, similar to the House report (of which a copy was attached), recommending passage. On April 7, the bill passed the Senate without debate or opposition. The bill was engrossed and signed on April 9 by the Speaker of the House pro tempore and by Charles Curtis, Vice President of the United States, and was presented to President Hoover on April 10.  Veto and override attempt  President Herbert Hoover On April 21, 1930, Hoover vetoed the bill, returning it unsigned with a list of his objections to the House of Representatives where it originated. This veto was the first of Hoover's presidency, and the first time a commemorative coin bill had been vetoed. The president vetoed the bill on the advice of the Treasury Department. Hoover noted the issuance of 15 commemorative coins over the past decade, something he said allowed the opportunity for counterfeiting. He stated, \\"the matter is not perhaps one of large importance in itself, were it not for the fact of the great number of other similar proposals\\"—he noted the five other commemorative coin bills then before Congress, and if the Gadsden Purchase bill were enacted, it would be harder to turn down the other proposals. Deeming the issuance of commemorative coins a misuse of the coinage system, he offered the government's assistance in the production of medals, which could provide a souvenir without impacting the coinage. Hoover's attitude was said to be informed by the return to the Mint for melting large amounts of several commemorative coin issues, something he considered wasteful. The day after the veto, the House Coinage Committee sought a vote to override it. Many of the bill's proponents came to the House floor to back the override, with the support of members from other parts of the country who sought commemorative coins. Those who would override dominated the debate, with only one speaker, House Majority Leader John Q. Tilson of Connecticut, supporting the president. The override attempt fell well short of the two-thirds needed, as 96 representatives voted in favor of the override, with 243 against it. Five Republicans voted to override Hoover's veto: New Mexico Congressman Simms and four from the East and Midwest. The New York Sun applauded Hoover's \\"sound common sense\\" while Hoffecker's hometown paper, the El Paso Herald, stated that \\"President Hoover administered a figurative slap to Arizona, New Mexico and El Paso\\". On April 26, The Washington Post published an editorial in favor of Hoover's action:  Aftermath  According to David Bullowa in his 1938 volume on commemoratives, \\"with the vetoing of the Gadsden Purchase half- dollar proposal ... a statement was issued that commemorative coins were superfluous and that their purpose might be as well accomplished with officially authorized medals. These pieces, if struck, would adequately serve collectors, it was thought, and such pieces would not tend to 'confuse the coinage'.\\" No commemorative coins were authorized or struck during the remainder of Hoover's presidency. Following the inauguration of Hoover's successor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, striking and authorization of commemoratives resumed. By 1935, Roosevelt had warned Congress against issuing large numbers of commemoratives and repeated this in 1937, both times citing Hoover's veto of the Gadsden Purchase bill, and urging the issuance of medals instead. He vetoed a coin bill in 1938 for the 400th anniversary of Coronado's expedition. In 1946, President Harry Truman signed the first authorizations for commemorative coins since 1937, but cited the Treasury's position and stated he would not look with favor on further issues. Citing Hoover's veto, he vetoed a bill for a commemorative half dollar for the centennial of Wisconsin statehood on July 31, 1947. Similar arguments were made by the Treasury under the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower, who vetoed three commemorative coin bills in 1954.1954 Congressional Record, Vol. 100, Pages 1215–1216 (February 3, 1954)1954 Congressional Record, Vol. 100, Page 1270 (February 3, 1954) No commemoratives were issued thereafter until the department changed its position in 1981, as the Washington 250th Anniversary half dollar was being considered; it was issued in 1982. The government sold the new commemoratives to collectors and dealers, rather than having sales conducted by a designated group. Although Hoffecker was unsuccessful with the Gadsden Purchase piece, he tried again in 1935. He was the designer and distributor of the Old Spanish Trail half dollar and was also the distributor of the Elgin, Illinois, Centennial half dollar (1936). In 1936, Hoffecker testified before Congress on the abuses committed by the distributors of commemorative coins. From 1939 to 1941, he served as president of the American Numismatic Association. He died in 1955.  See also  *Louisiana Purchase Sesquicentennial half dollar, vetoed by Eisenhower in 1954.

They stopped for a short time in the United States before continuing to China as missionaries under the auspices of the American Presbyterian Church. In the U.S. Byers became acquainted with and became influenced by the idea that boys and girls should receive a similar education. In 1853, widowed, she returned New York, connecting with American religious women, and to Ireland in the following year at the behest of her mother, making her home in Belfast. Her son, Sir John Byers, became president of the Belfast Philosophical Society. Byers became deeply interested in the conditions of Irish women and began efforts for their improvement. She founded and became director of Victoria College, which was prominent in pioneer educational work. The institution began as a secondary school before college education for women had been discussed. In 1878, she worked for the inclusion of girls in the benefits of the Irish Intermediate act. In 1881, the Royal University of Ireland offered its examination and degrees to women. Byers was the first Ulster woman to receive an honorary degree from a university. She was a member of the first senate of the Queen's University Belfast. In conjunction with other women, she founded in 1874 the Belfast Women's Temperance Association and Christian Workers' Union out of which was developed the Belfast Prison Gate Mission for Women and the Victoria Homes for the Reclamation and Training of Neglected and Destitute Girls. Margaret Byers' commemorative plaque Byers was the first president of the Irish Women's Temperance Union. She was the author of many papers on different phases of the progress of girls' education in Ireland and on Irish industrial schools and temperance. She received the degree of LL. D. from the University of Dublin. Byers died on 21 February 1912 and is buried in Belfast City Cemetery.

The statue, which now stands on the bridge Pont Neuf, was indirectly commissioned by Marie de Médicis for her husband, King Henry IV of France. The original commissioned artist, Giambologna, had died before its completion, making Pietro Tacca take over the commission. The statue itself was erected in 1614. It was then torn down in 1792 during the French Revolution, but was later rebuilt by 1818.  Description  The original statue of King Henry IV depicts the king riding his horse, which is placed on top of a central raised pedestal. At each of the four corners of the pedestal is a bronze statue of a chained slave. The pedestal's design was made by Ludovico Cigoli with the help of Pietro Tacca, Pietro Francavilla and Francesco Bordoni in its creation. According to the drawings of Ludovico Cigoli, a Medici court artist, the slaves were depicted with European features and posed with \\"Michaelangelsque contortions\\". The four slaves all rest on the bottom ledge of the pedestal and are chained to the harpies behind them on the upper corners of the pedestal. In Ludovico's drawing the slaves are bound with bands around their arms and chained to the harpies' hips. Other details on the pedestal are scenes of battle on the left and presumably the right side of the statue, along with \\"seated youths bearing swags\\". According to Victoria Thompson, the king and horse's pose were heavily influenced by the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and his own equestrian statue.  Creation   Commission  Marie de Médicis was the primary person to have wanted the creation of the statue of Henry IV. In 1604 it was most likely her that convinced her uncle, Ferdinando I, to have a miniature of the desired bronze statue commissioned. Due to her concerns on the potentially slow pace of the actual statue's completion (due to Giambologna's age at the time), she wanted to shorten the process. She did so by suggesting a time-saving idea. She suggested to Ferdinando I that since the bronze body and horse of his statue was already made, that it could be used instead of the original idea for the figure. He rejected the idea, but suggested that previous molds for his horse were to be reused instead. Ferdinando I then visited Giambolongna's workshop to see the work that had been done. On September 17 and November 6 of 1607 he saw the cast of the horse and potentially any other progress that was made. Maria de Medici made her own checks on the workshop during 1606–1608. She used courtiers to keep tabs on the statue's progress. One by the name of Calvaliere Camillo Guidi was used to inform the King and Queen of anything concerning the statue's completion, whether it was a lack of labor or even money.  Delays  It was the concern for time that made Giambologna have his assistant, Pietro Tacca aid him on the project. Tacca had been the one to cast the bronze of both the horse and body of Henry IV. He had also been the one to have made the head of the statue and the extra embellishments on the front of Henry IV. He even had to take over the project when Giambolongna had died in August 1608. At the time of Giambologna's death, Pietro Tacca was working on a commission for the wedding of the Grand Duchess Cristina. Another instance included bad weather impeding the casting of the horses in bronze near the end of 1608. Delays in the transport of the statue from the workshop to Paris occurred as well. Pietro Tacca and Giovan Battista Cresci had to weigh the statue, which took time that Marie de Médicis had not wanted to waste. Afterwards there was a stall after the statue's pieces arrived in Livorno, as no one decided to ship it out for almost a year. Various other delays occurred, such as complications in transportation by ship, like after landing in Savona, where the statue's parts were stranded on the seaport's docks for at least a week.  Completion  Prior to the statue's completion, Henry IV was assassinated. This then added to the significance of the statue as it had yet to be finished at the time. Even though the official date of the statue's completion is unknown, sources gathered by Kathrine Watson state that Baldinucci took note of its completion in 1611. The statue was then shipped out of the workshop on March 5, 1612 after it had been weighed for transport. The statue of the king and horse were placed on its base on Pont Neuf in 1614.  Destruction of original  During the French Revolution, in 1792, the original statue was torn down from its spot on the Pont Neuf. It was around this time that many citizens became distrustful of their king, Louis XVI, due to increasing suspicions of him being a traitor. It was on August 11, 1792 that the citizens tore down the statues of Louis XIII, Louis XIV, and Louis XV. Henry IV's statue was torn down the next day. This delay was due to the \\"symbolic 'virtues' \\" the statue held to the people of the revolution. The rider and horse were both destroyed, sparing only three pieces of the king, and a part of the horse. The four slaves on the pedestal, along with the four pieces of the king and horse, were saved and now reside in the Louvre.  Recreation  The statue in 2003 Prior to the French Revolution the people who learned of Henry IV's contributions to the history and wellbeing of France regarded him as the model of a good king. This contributed to the symbolism of the statue and its integration into royal ceremonies. As time went on, the oral stories and memories of the people continued, reinforcing the significance of the statue as it represented the important ideas and values that the people of France held to their future kings, like Louis XVI. When the Revolution began and the suspicions against Louis XVI grew, it clashed with the people's views and wishes of what their king was expected to represent. When Louis XVIII, Louis XVI's brother, had re-entered Paris, a temporary replacement statue made of plaster-of-paris stood on Pont Neuf. This was made possible by the Minister of the Interior, Jacques-Claude Beugnot. Due to the comparisons of Louis XVIII to Henry IV and many people's desires, plans for the restoration of the statue were underway. Bronze for the new statue was obtained from a statue of Louis Charles Antoine Desaix, as well as from the statue of Napoleon in Place Vendôme. The new version of the statue, made by François-Frédéric Lemot, was finished by 1818. The statue that can be seen today varies from its previous version. The current statue still retains the iconic pose of Henry IV and his horse, but the main differences are visible on the pedestal. The slaves, harpies, and youths from the previous version were not integrated into the present-day version of the piece.  References   Bibliography  *Boime, Albert (Aug 18, 2004).

Location The road starts at Katuna, at the international border with Rwanda, and approximately south of Kabale, the largest city in the Kigezi sub-region, and the location of the headquarters of Kabale District. From there, the road takes a general north-westerly direction, looping around the southern shores of Lake Bunyonyi. It passes between the Rwandan border to the west and the western shores of the lake to the east. It goes through a community called Kashasha, about from Katuna. The road then continues northwards for another , to end at Muko, on the Kabale–Kisoro–Bunagana Road. Muko is approximately , north-west of Kabale. Overview This road is of importance to Uganda for two reasons. Lake Bunyonyi is increasingly becoming attractive to tourists, some of whom may come in from Rwanda, by road. Secondly, increased tourism demands increased services, leading to improved standards of living for those who provide those services. Improved transportation for the residents will enable them to benefit from the increased economic activity around the lake. Upgrading to bitumen In February 2019, David Bahati, the junior minister for economic planning, who also doubles as the area member of parliament, announced that the government of Uganda had officially approached the African Development Bank and the Exim Bank of China to request a loan of US$96 million to upgrade this road to class II bitumen.

K-128's southern terminus is at U.S. Route 24 (US-24) and K-9 northwest of Glen Elder, and the northern terminus continues as Nebraska Highway 78 (N-78) at the Nebraska border north of Burr Oak. West of Mankato, a small section of K-128 is co-designated as US-36. Before state highways were numbered in Kansas, there were auto trails, which were an informal network of marked routes that existed in the United States and Canada in the early part of the 20th century. The section of K-128 that overlaps with US-36 was part of the Pikes Peak Ocean to Ocean Highway auto trail. K-128 was first designated on January 7, 1937, and ran from US-24 and K-9 north to US-36. In February 1996, K-28 was truncated to K-14 in Jewell, and the section of K-28 from US-36 to the Nebraska state line became an extension of K-128. Route description K-128 begins at an intersection with K-9 and US-24 just north of Waconda Lake and northwest of Glen Elder in Mitchell County. It begins travelling northward for roughly , through rural farmlands, before reaching the Jewell County line. After entering Jewell County it continues northward, following to the west of Limestone Creek, a tributary of the Solomon River. About past the county line, K-128 crosses West Limestone Creek, a tributary of Limestone Creek. The highway continues from here for about , before it reaches the western terminus of K-228, which runs eastward to serve Ionia. From K-228, the highway continues northward until it reaches US-36. At US-36, K-128 turns eastward and runs concurrent with US-36 for about then turns northward and leaves US-36, which continues east toward Mankato. It continues northward for roughly , before reaching Burr Oak, where it becomes Main Street. As it continues north through the city it crosses White Rock Creek, a tributary of the Republican River, then exits the city. Just north of Burr Oak it crosses Walnut Creek then Wolf Creek, both tributaries of White Rock Creek. About later, K-128 intersects Cedar Road, also known as Rural Secondary 336 (RS-336). At Cedar Road, K-128 turns westward for before turning back north at Cedar Road (RS-335). From here, K-128 continues northward for before reaching N-78 at the Nebraska state line. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2017, they determined that on average the traffic varied from 295 vehicles per day slightly north of Burr Oak to 1410 vehicles per day along the concurrency with US-36. The only section of K-128 that is included in the National Highway System is its concurrency with US-36. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-128 also connects to the National Highway System at its junction with US-24. History Early roads Before state highways were numbered in Kansas there were auto trails, which were an informal network of marked routes that existed in the United States and Canada in the early part of the 20th century. The section of K-128 that overlaps with US-36 was part of the Pikes Peak Ocean to Ocean Highway. The southern terminus was part of the Roosevelt National Highway, Kansas White Way, and Sunflower Trail. Establishment and realignments K-128 was assigned by the State Highway Commission of Kansas on January 7, 1937, and ran from US-24 and K-9 north to US-36. K-128 originally ran directly north–south through Ionia until it was moved slightly westward to a new alignment in 1945, and at that time K-228 was created to link Ionia to the new alignment. The United States Bureau of Reclamation began purchasing rights-of-way in June 1963, and then started constructing the Glen Elder Dam and Waconda Lake in November 1964. Then in 1965, US-24 was realigned slightly north to a new alignment and K-128 was shortened by to meet the new alignment of US-24 and K-9 to make way for the new lake. On February 8, 1996, K-28 was truncated to K-14 in Jewell and the section of K-28 from US-36 to the Nebraska state line became an extension of K-128, which created a short overlap with US-36.

Wallace Leo Jenkins (1896-1941) was an American law enforcement officer. He was a pioneer in the use of technology and science in South Carolina law enforcement. Jenkins served with the South Carolina Highway Patrol from its creation in 1930 until his death in 1941. He created and led the Identification Bureau, a unit that evolved into a team of skilled investigators who used technology to fight crime. The ID Bureau later merged with the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) and became the foundation for SLED’s Criminal Justice Information Services and Forensics Services units.  Early life  Jenkins was born in Santuc, South Carolina on February 18, 1896. As a young man he worked as a mechanic for the Overland Automobile Company in Spartanburg. Jenkins attended Columbia University in New York City for two years. His education was interrupted when he volunteered for service in World War I. He served as an officer in the mechanical branch of Naval Aviation. After the war, he returned to South Carolina where he ran his own bus line and maintained a business relationship with Overland.  South Carolina Highway Patrol  In 1930, Jenkins became a member of the first class of the newly formed South Carolina Highway Patrol. On April 19, 1932 Jenkins was severely injured after he stopped a car near Lancaster. The three occupants of the car were escaped convicts who beat Jenkins nearly to death. During a prolonged medical leave, Jenkins was doubtful as to whether he would be physically able to return to duty. As a back-up plan he studied fingerprinting through a correspondence course with the Chicago Institute of Applied Science. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was in the midst of a campaign to encourage each state to establish a state-level fingerprint repository to work in conjunction with their newly-created national file. The South Carolina Police Chiefs Association (SCPCA) was lobbying the state government to create an ID Bureau, and local law enforcement agencies in general supported the idea.  Creation of the State Identification Bureau  When Jenkins returned to work, news of his fingerprinting skills spread quickly. He was promoted to Special Investigator on June 12, 1934 with orders to assist local law enforcement agencies. Jenkins established the state’s first fingerprint repository and the first state-level system of law enforcement communications. In short order, Jenkins was called in on every major crime in the state. The ID Bureau added personnel and expanded their scientific capabilities. Jenkins became a recognized expert in fingerprints, firearms, ballistics, photography and questioned documents. During the late 1930s he became a household name in South Carolina. He was in demand as a speaker at civic clubs and scientific societies, and his Crime Fighting booth at the annual State Fair drew thousands of visitors. On May 28, 1940, Jenkins was presented with the SCPCA's Distinguished Service Award. That same year, with war looming, Jenkins assisted the US Army in screening out undesirable recruits at Fort Jackson, the largest military training installation in the country.  Legacy  After a sudden and brief illness Jenkins died on January 24, 1941 at age 43. The ID Bureau carried on under Jenkins’ protégé, Lt. Joel Townsend. In a speech to the Columbia Rotary Club on May 14, 1946, Townsend made it clear that Jenkins’ vision for the unit was intact: “It is not a body charged with general law enforcement, and takes the initiative in no case. It only assists and cooperates with other law enforcement agencies throughout South Carolina.” In 1947 the ID Bureau was moved from the Highway Patrol to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. Lt. Townsend was appointed as the Chief of SLED, where he maintained the principles of service derived from his mentor, Leo Jenkins.Leo Jenkins, The Architect of Modern Law Enforcement in South Carolina, 2012, by Buddy Wilkes, .

The southern terminus is at K-23 north of Hoxie, and the northern terminus is at K-383 in Dresden. Along the way K-123 intersects the western terminus of K-9 south of Dresden. Between 1938 and 1940, K-23 was realigned to follow K-9 west to US-83, then north to US-36 and US-183 in Oberlin and at this time K-123 was created to replace the former alignment of K-23 from K-9 to Dresden. Between 1944 and 1945, K-9 was realigned to end at US-83 in Dresden. Then between 1953 and 1956, K-9 was realigned to start at K-123 south of Dresden. On April 1, 1981, K-123's northern terminus was renumbered from US-383 to K-383. Route description K-123 begins at K-23 north of the city of Hoxie and begins travelling east through rural farmlands. After it curves north at an intersection with 10E and 140N. Another farther north it intersects the western terminus of K-9, and enters into Decatur County. The highway begins to transition to rolling hills as it continues north for about then crosses and unnamed creek. The landscape begins to transition back to rural farmlands and then another farther north, K-123 enters the city of Dresden. The highway continues north through the city for a short distance before reaching its northern terminus at K-383. Past K-383 the roadway continues as locally maintained Kings Avenue. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2017, they determined that on average the traffic varied from 240 vehicles at its northern terminus to 255 vehicles at its southern terminus. K-123 is not included in the National Highway System, a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-123 does connect to the National Highway System at its junction with K-383. History Before state highways were numbered in Kansas there were auto trails, which were an informal network of marked routes that existed in the United States and Canada in the early part of the 20th century. The former Pikes Peak Ocean to Ocean Highway followed K-123's northern terminus. In 1927, the highway that became K-123 was established as K-23. Then between July 1938 and 1940, US-183 was realigned to go east from Oberlin along US-36. At this time K-23 was realigned to follow K-9 west to US-83, then north to US-36 and US-183 in Oberlin and K-123 was created to replace the former alignment of K-23 from K-9 to Dresden. Between 1941 and 1944, US-183 and US-83 were swapped within Nebraska and a small portion into Kansas. At this time K-23 was truncated to its present day northern terminus at US-83 and K-9 was truncated to end at K-23. Between 1944 and 1945, K-9 was realigned to end at US-83 in Dresden. In a December 20, 1950 resolution, it was approved to realign K-9 to start at K-123 south of Dresden. Then between 1953 and 1956, construction had finished and K-9 was realigned to start at K-123 south of Dresden. On April 1, 1981, K-123's northern terminus was renumbered from US-383 to K-383.

During the escalation, fake videos and misinformation were prevalent on the social media which were further reported to escalate tensions between India and Pakistan. Once tensions started de-escalating, the media coverage shifted to comparisons being made between \\"India and Pakistan\\" and \\"Narendra Modi and Imran Khan\\" in terms of who won the \\"perception battle\\".  Background  Propaganda and psychological warfare through the media is an old concept. The media in both India and Pakistan are important \\"stakeholders\\" during times of heightened tensions between the two countries. Previous studies conducted have suggested the \\"nationalistic\\" role of the media in relation to India and Pakistan conflicts.Dwaipayan Bose (2011). \\"Journalism Caught in Narrow Nationalism: The India-Pakistan Media War\\" Reuters institute for the Study of Journalism. University of Oxford. Thomson Reuters Foundation. A Bournemouth University doctoral study by Chindu Sreedharan concluded the dominance of \\"anti-peace news\\" in the overall coverage of Kashmir suggesting that the press in India and Pakistan has a counterproductive role in the Kashmir issue and that the \\"coverage was vigorously government-led and intensely 'negative'\\".Sreedharan, C., (2009). Reporting Kashmir: an analysis of the conflict coverage in Indian and Pakistani newspapers. Doctorate Thesis (Doctorate). Bournemouth University. Archived from the original on 10 August 2017. A study in the Pakistan Journal of History and Culture found that newspapers of both countries (India and Pakistan) were \\"setting the agenda on Kashmir issue positively in the light of foreign policy of their respective country\\".  War mongering  Various accusations were made against the sections of the Indian and Pakistani media for war-mongering. Indian Nobel Peace Prize laureate Kailash Satyarthi acknowledged the war-mongering prevalent among the Indian media, but added that there were many journalists trying to \\"de-escalate\\" the situation too. Both in India and Pakistan, media unions called for a stop on the war-mongering. A story in Quartz quotes Indian journalist Sadanand Dhume (a fellow at the American think tank American Enterprise Institute) where he says “Paradoxically, the over-zealous Indian media and Pakistani media may help prevent escalation of conflict.\\" Foreign Policy came out with an article titled \\"India’s Media Is War-Crazy\\". According to it, Indian journalists were very much willing to “reproduce unverified, contradictory and speculative information” that suited the Indian government.  Perception war  Ajai Shukla, an Indian journalist and former Indian Army colonel, writes in Al Jazeera that \\"Pakistan won the perception war\\", however adds that Pakistan is losing out in other ways. A report in an Indian media digital website, Scroll.in, was titled \\"How Imran Khan stumped Narendra Modi in the perception battle over air strikes\\" where it criticises Narendra Modi for not addressing the media directly during the crisis as compared to Imran Khan who addressed the media directly during the crisis more than once, and in turn directed the narrative. A report in a Pakistani newspaper The News International however said that even if Imran Khan and Narendra Modi won the perception battles in their respective constituencies, neither side wanted a war according to Vipin Narang, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  Fake news and fact-checking  Various media houses resorted to fact-checking related to misinformation related to Air Marshal Chandrashekharan Hari Kumar, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthanman, F-16s, an Indian submarine and various other things. It was reported after the Balakot airstrikes on 26 February, a fact checking website \\"Check4Spam\\" reported a 79% increase in traffic. Old videos and photographs of \\"crashing fighter jets\\" were being circulated in both India and Pakistan during the crisis as recent events.

It refers to an increase in reaction time to non-attended stimuli located across the vertical meridian, compared to non-attended stimuli located across the horizontal meridian (Huges & Zimba, 1987),Hughes, H. C., & Zimba, L. D. (1987). Natural boundaries for the spatial spread of directed visual attention. Neuropsychologia, 25(1), 5-18. doi:10.1016/0028-3932(87)90039-X i.e., the movement of attention is slower when it has to cross the vertical meridian as compared to the horizontal meridian. The horizontal meridian in a visual field extends from the left to the right of the observer. The vertical meridian, on the other hand extends from above the line of sight of the observer to below the line of sight of the observer. The vertical meridian can also be seen as a barrier that differentiates the attended stimuli from the non- attended stimuli. Meridian crossing effect can also be called different-hemifield advantage. According to this, performance rates increase when a task is completed across both the left and right visual hemifields than when performed in a within hemifield version of the task (Sereno & Kosslyn, 1991).• Sereno, A. B., & Kosslyn, S. M. (1991). Discrimination within and between hemifields: A new constraint on theories of attention. Neuropsychologia, 29(7), 659-675. doi:10.1016/0028-3932(91)90100-M A hemifield can be defined as a 170° range of vision that is seen by one eye focusing straight ahead. This should not be confused with bilateral distribution advantage. Different-hemifield advantage mainly holds true only for early perceptual processes. It focuses on the competition for attentional resources in spatial attention. Bilateral distribution advantage on the other hand occurs during more complex or demanding tasks. The Meridian crossing effect was first described by H. C. Huges and L. D. Zimba in the year 1987 in their paper, \\"Natural boundaries for the spatial spread of directed visual attention\\". History The original study by Huges and Zimba started off as an extension of the various studies done revolving around the concept of directed attention, its spatial characteristics and the movement of attention to different locations within the visual field. Their first experiment aimed to determine whether visual performance varied for locations across the vertical and horizontal meridian based on expectancy and to check if attention can be directed both vertically and horizontally. The results showed that cues directed to locations on both the vertical meridian and the horizontal meridian, have similar attentional costs and benefits. Nevertheless, they also reported that subjects have larger decrements in performance when their attention crosses the vertical meridian than when it crosses the horizontal meridian (Huges and Zimba, 1987). Theoretical Context Meridian crossing effect came about as an extension of one of the theories of the spatial structure of attention (Sereno & Kosslyn, 1991). Shifting focus theories This is one of the oldest theories of the spatial structure of attention. According to this theory, subjects require more time to process targets that occur at unexpected locations as compared to those that occur at expected locations. Gradient theories According to this theory, resources are processed and made available based on the expectancy of target location, i.e., the farther a stimulus is from the locus of attention, the less processing resources are available (Sereno & Kosslyn, 1991). Hemifield theories Similar to gradient theories, hemifield theories also predict a gradient of attention. However this gradient is spread out throughout the visual hemifield in which the target is expected. This therefore, is a benefit to that hemifield and a disadvantage to the opposite hemifield (Sereno & Kosslyn). Neurobiological bases One of the proposed reasons for the decrease in performance when attention crosses the vertical meridian is the shifting of processing of the information from one cerebral hemisphere to the other, across the corpus callosum (Huges & Zimba, 1987). According to Downing and Pinker (1985),DOWNINGC, . J. and PINKER,S. The spatial structure of visual attention. In Attention and Performance XI, M. I. POSNERand 0. S. M. MARIN(Editors), pp. 171-187. Erlbaum, Hillsdale, 1985. on the other hand, decrements in attention when it crosses the vertical meridian can be attributed to the crossing of the foveal region, i.e., the attentional gradient becomes steeper at the fovea. Therefore, two points which are equally distant from each other seem farther apart at the foveal region as compared to when within the same boundary (Downing and Pinker, 1985). Cognitive bases On the basis of the experiments conducted by Sereno and Kosslyn (1991), in which participants were confronted with two briefly presented stimuli either in one visual hemifield or in the left and right visual hemifields, they argued that the different-hemifield advantage may result from separate, hemisphere-specific pools of attentional capacity operating during perceptual encoding, leading to twice as many resource pools being available during task performance across both hemifields. Processing multiple stimuli that are presented within one hemifield is suggested to lead to high intrahemispheric competition for common processing structures and low interhemispheric competition for representation and requires hemisphere specific processes to take place in parallel (Sereno & Kosslyn, 1991). But the extent to which these pools of processing information impact attention has not been accounted for. Further research needs to be done to understand the causes of this different hemifield advantage.

He graduated in 1924 BA from the University of Oxford. He studied medicine at University College Hospital Medical School. He qualified MRCS, LRCP in 1927 and MRCP in 1930. He graduated BM BCh in 1927 and DM in 1932. He held his residency appointments at University College Hospital. On his return to the UK he held appointments successively at St Thomas' Hospital, University College Hospital, and the Radcliffe Infirmary. Cope was elected FRCP in 1939. In 1940 he published his paper The Diagnostic Value of Pregnandiol Excretion in Pregnancy Disorders. He became in 1942 a lieutenant-colonel in the RAMC; he served from 1944 to 1945 in France and Holland and then in the postwar-era in Norway. He was director of human problems research for the UK's National Coal Board from 1947 to 1949. He was then appointed to the Royal Postgraduate Medical School. By applying chromatography and isotopes he developed methods for measuring urine levels, blood levels, and production rates for cortisol and aldosterone. In 1954 Cope and J. García-Llauradó published evidence of excess secretion of aldosterone in a case of potassium-losing nephropathy, occurring in a 41-year-old patient with a renal tube anomaly associated with a chronic pyelonephritis. Cope, García-Llauradó, and M. D. Milne were among the first researchers to identify primary aldosteronism, also known as Conn's syndrome. In 1958 Cope and E. Black introduced a new method for measuring the production rate of cortisol. In their method, the patient first empties the bladder and drinks a small test dose of 14C-labelled cortisol. The patient's urine is then collected over the next 24 hours. From the urine sample, a measurement is made of the sample's total 14C content, and a measurement is also made of the specific activity of the sample's tetrahydrocortisol, a metabolite of cortisol. In 1959 Cope and Black published their paper The Reliability of Some Adrenal Function Tests. In 1964 Cope was the President of the Section of Endocrinology at the annual meeting of the Royal Society of Medicine. In 1966 he gave the Lumleian Lectures on The Adrenal Cortex in Internal Medicine. He retired at age 65 but continued his laboratory work. In 1972 he was awarded the Royal College of Physicians' Moxon Medal. Family Zachary Cope was his uncle. On 9 July 1937 in Totnes, Devon, Cuthbert Leslie Cope married Eileen Gertrude Putt. They had two sons, Jonathan Leslie (b. 1940) and David Robert (b. 1944). The older son became a member of the medical profession, and the younger son became an outstanding headmaster.

Construction began in 1967, but the progress was stalled from 1971 to 1983, due to political disputes. In 1979, Corinthians was interested in taking over and build their own stadium in place, but the deal with the Mauá City Hall fell through. The construction was concluded in 1984. The municipal stadium of Mauá has only one set of uncovered stands, built of reinforced concrete over a slope and features no floodlights. The maximum capacity at the time was 15,000. For the opening match, a friendly was arranged by Mauaense against São Paulo on 8 December 1984. The visitors won 2-1. The following year, Mauaense became owners of the stadium, but that only lasted until 1991, when control was given back to the local government. Santo André played part of its home games during the 1985 season. In 1991, the stadium was named after local amateur footballer Pedro Benedetti. The ground was used as the home venue for the Palmeiras reserves team for the 2009 season, as the São Paulo club made a deal to improve the pitch and the locker rooms.

Nelson (April 13, 1927 – May 4, 2003) was an American environmental activist who is best known as the mother of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Early life Sue Nelson was born Susan Louise Barr in Syracuse, New York on April 13, 1927, the child of an accountant and a teacher. Her family moved to Los Angeles where she attended Alexander Hamilton High School and UCLA, graduating in 1948 with a degree in political science. She later earned a master's degree from UCLA in urban planning in 1969. Environmental activism Nelson started her conservationist career as a housewife in Mandeville Canyon. She later became an active member in the Sierra Club, the Peace and Freedom Party, and the Green Party. In 1964 she helped to found the Friends of the Santa Monica Mountains, Parks and Seashore, and also became this group's president. She is credited by congressman Anthony Beilenson as being the single greatest driver behind the establishment by Congress in 1978 of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, the first truly urban national park. Along with Nelson, two other women (Jill Swift and Margot Feuer) were instrumental in bringing about federal, legal recognition of the SMMNRA. In the years following this federal legislation, Nelson lobbied Congress to provide more funding to expand and improve the parkland. Nelson also worked on a variety of other conservation projects throughout the Los Angeles region in the 1980s and 1990s, including areas such as Malibu Creek State Park, Point Mugu, Hollywood, Temescal Canyon, and Topanga Canyon. She also voiced her vocal opposition, through newspaper opinion pieces and town hall meetings, to development projects such as the Malibu Canyon Freeway, the Pacific Coast Freeway, and the Mulholland Highway. In addition, Nelson sounded a warning bell against the privatization of public parklands. Her persistence led some to call her ruthless, but also warmhearted and feisty. Personal life Nelson married Earl Nelson in 1948. Together they had four children, but the marriage ended in divorce. Nelson's son-in-law was the composer James Horner. She died on May 4, 2003 after she was hit by a car near her home in Echo Park, Los Angeles. Legacy Nelson's archives are held in the Oviatt Library of California State University, Northridge.

Early life  Fabian was born in El Paso, Texas, to Mexican immigrant parents. His family moved to the affordable housing projects in Boyle Heights, East L.A. Struggling with poverty, lack of resources, exposure to gang violence, and a father in and out of jail, Debora struggled with anger issues and used his artwork as an outlet. During his middle school years he attended Dolores Mission Catholic School, and was kicked out after lashing out at a teacher who ripped up his artwork in class. After this, Debora was sent to public school where exposure to gang-related activity increased. Deborah joined a gang at the age of 12 and at the same time was put on probation for truancy and spent time in juvenile hall around five different times for different reasons, one being carrying a firearm at school.  East Los Angeles gang activity  After being forced to attend public school, Fabian joined a gang at the age of 12. Growing up in one of the most violent areas in Los Angeles, Fabian Debora began to graffiti tag around his neighbourhood at thirteen years old. Submerged in the streets of one of the most violent gangs in East LA, Debora joined one the gangs “which plagued the housing projects” that Debora's family lived in. Fabian Debora acquired the gang name of “Spade.\\" While in the East LA gang, Debora began to deal drugs as well as abuse them; gang activity marked the start of a battle with substance abuse.  Substance abuse  After joining a gang, Deborah began experimenting with drugs in high school. He began with marijuana, but after smoking crack laced Marijuana he began smoking crack. Eventually, he became addicted to methamphetamines. The substance abuse worsened his situation at home and his relationship with his mother. After he threatened her one-day, she reported it to the police, yet stated she just wanted him to get help for his drug problem. He participated in a one-year rehabilitation program, yet failed to pass drug tests several times, leading to going back to jail. After attempting to commit suicide in 2006, Debora had a religious experience where he says he interacted with God. This led him to go to rehab again and has been sober ever since, and went to school for drug counseling. He is now certified by the state of California to be a licensed drug counselor.  Art  Despite not having an MFA, Debora has the skills of a masterful painter. He began using art as a form of self expression while in middle school by drawing during class in order to help him cope with living in the impoverished Boyle Heights housing projects with an absent father. When he joined a gang, he went under the name “spade” and began to be a graffiti tagger. He used graffiti as well as a form of artistic expression and unknowingly was working on his craft. Once he was older, in between being in and out of jail, he became a tattoo artist, giving tattoos to get extra cash through his art. Fabian began painting murals throughout his community and since 1997 has produced over seven murals throughout the L.A. area and many more throughout various different cities. Eventually, Fabian mastered acrylic painting, which is the medium he uses for most of his work. Fabian studied under Vincent Valdez for three months, where he learned all techniques he needed to perfect his talent. Now, Fabian has won several awards for his art and is extremely reputable and famous in the Chicano community, and is currently trying to have his art recognized by mainstream culture.  Work  After his spiritual awakening Debora went to Homeboy industries to get a job. However, he realized that the facility was a lacking a drug counseling program which was integral to helping ex-gang members and others at risk get their life back on track. Fabian then went to Inner Coast College to become a drug counselor, and received the highest certification from the state. Debora took this back to homeboy industries and became the director of their drug counseling program and began teaching others the skills he had learned. In 2008, he met Sandra Quintana, the founder of Latino Producers Action Network (LPAN), who recruited him to use his art skills to better the community. LPAN gave him a studio and helped him focus on his career as an artist. With LPAN, Debora started “La Clase” art academy which focuses on art as a method of self expression, rehabilitation, and healing in order to give guidance for at risk youth and others struggling with gang culture, incarceration, and substance abuse. Fabian is now the Executive director at LPAN and a full-time artist.  Awareness  Fabian's passion for helping individuals get back on their feet after incarceration or being in the system sparked from his own experience. “Society states that once you do jail time, or pay your debt to society, you’re supposed to be welcomed to the community, but that’s not so true. I believe there are still systems of exclusion and oppression that exist, prohibiting people from reaching their fullest potential,” Fabian shares. When young, Debora felt constantly compared to others and humiliated. In school, Fabian did not have motivation because “the teachers didn’t have the tools to deal with this particular population of misguided, and traumatized youth.\\" The government constantly threatened Fabian's single mother in despair and poverty with fines if Fabian didn't attend school, leading to more aggression and disappointment with the school system. From personal experience of struggles with lack of resources for underrepresented individuals, Debora decided to make it his mission to educate youth like himself. Debora began teaching youth everything that he knows, and particularly on how to transform and find oneself through art. Through facilitating art workshops, holding conferences, and sharing his story, Fabian is inspiring youth.  Awards and recognition  In 2011 Deborah was honored by the Belle Foundation for Cultural Development, Grantee, San Jose, Calif. In 2007, Edward James Olmos awarded him a scholarship and featured Debora in a 2007 documentary called Voces de Cambio.

History In 1897, brothers Emmett and Jeremiah Hinshaw purchased a general merchandise business in Plevna, Kansas. They named the business \\"Hinshaw and Hinshaw General Merchandising.\\" 1910s-1920s In September 1913, the Hinshaw brothers began construction of a new general store building, located at the corner of 3rd Ave and Main street in Plevna. The new \\"Hinshaw and Hinshaw General Store\\" opened for business the week of November 17, 1913. In 1917, Emmett Hinshaw's son, N.H. \\"Jack\\" Hinshaw, purchased a one quarter interest of stock in the business from his father and uncle. A year later, in 1918, Jeremiah Hinshaw left the business. 1920s-1970s Following Emmett Hinshaw’s death in 1928, his son Jack took ownership of the store. Jack operated the store for the next 47 years until selling the business in 1975. 1970s-1980s Mr. & Mrs. Darrell Lee Holmes purchased the store from Hinshaw in 1975 and operated it until 1987.

Also, she has a position in the faculty at the California Centre for Population Research (CCPR) since 2008 and serves as a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) since 2009 to present. One of Adriana Lleras-Muney’s most prestigious accomplishments has been the appointment of one of the 102 recipients of the Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE). This award is regarded to be the highest honour granted by the United States Government in the fields of science and engineering for their independent research careers in their early stages. Lleras-Muney received this appointment in the Department of Health and Human Services. The recipients of the PECASE are rewarded for their impactful contributions to the United States and the award shows the impacts of Federal investments in the field of science to the contribution to the economy.  Research  Adriana Lleras-Muney’s research interests include health, income, gender, economic development, determinants of fertility and education.  “Mind the Gap: A Review of The Health Gap: The Challenge of an Unequal World by Sir Michael Marmot” (2018)  Adriana Lleras-Muney investigates The Health Gap which focuses on the health gaps within developed, rich countries today. Compared to other developed countries, the US faces substantial gaps in health and mortality rates depending on socio-economic status. Some developed countries have managed to reduce the health gap over time. Sir Michael Marmot argues that low socioeconomic status are driving factors of low health status. Moreover, Marmot expresses that in order to overcome this health gap, it is important to look into the deeper causes of occurring health gaps. Proximate factors such as easier access to health care is not a deep cause. What he believes to be the root causes are poverty, education and occupational mobility. In addition, Marmot observations go into policies that have succeeded in reducing the gap and an overall improvement in health. \\"Breaking the Glass Ceiling? The Effect of Board Quotas on Female Labor Market Outcomes in Norway\\" (2018)  Adriana Lleras-Muney co-authored this article with Marianne Bertrand (Chicago Booth School of Business, CEPR, IZA and NBER), Sandra E. Black (University of Texas, Austin, NHH, ICA and NBER), Sissel Jensen (Norwegian School of Economics). This paper examines the effects of the Norwegian Law that was passed in 2003 on the Female Labor Market. The Law mandated the board of public limited liability companies to have each gender representation at 40%, this law was enforced with the mission to increase the percentage of women representatives in the top tier of corporate sectors and to reduce the gender wage gap. From the proximate results, there was a reduction in the gender wage disparity within the boards, as well as the women that were appointed new roles in the boards were more qualified than previous female representatives. However, the new law did not have much effect on: the other women in the company and women how are highly qualified but were not appointed for the position on the board. Moreover, it could not be concluded strongly that this implementation had positive effects on young women. A factor that backs this uncertainty is that there was no change in female enrolment in business education programs. This investigation concluded that whilst the passing of the law had direct influences on the women and wage disparity of those that were appointed seats on the board, it did not have enough effect to have a positive influence on women in business. “The long- Run Impact of Cash Transfers to Poor Families” (2016) Alongside Anna Aizer (Brown University & NBER), Shari Eli (University of Toronto & NBER), Joseph Ferrie (Northwestern University & NBER), Adriana Lleras-Muney investigated the long-term impacts of cash transfers to poor families based on the factors of children longevity, educational attainment, nutritional status, and income in adulthood. In order to reduce poverty the U.S. primarily supports those that are in need of aid by offering specific foods, shelter, insurance, etc. These are all objects, however this paper examines the benefits of giving poor families cash instead of these specific goods. In order to investigate this case, data and records of individual applicants were collected from the Mothers’ Pension program. This investigation was conducted by tracking the lives of the children born between 1900 and 1925 from the families that received or were denied cash through the Mothers’ Pension program. From aligning data alongside World War II enlistment records they were able to come to the result that cash transfers decreased the risk of children being underweight at the time of enrolment. The paper addresses the concern that giving cash to poor mothers could be used in inappropriate ways, however the results have shown that on average, the recipients of cash were able to improve the lives of their children.  \\"The Determinants of Mortality\\" (2006)  In this paper, written jointly with Angus Deaton (Harvard University) and David Cutler (Princeton University), Lleras-Muney investigates the causes of the decline in the mortality rate -and its associated health benefits- of developed countries. The authors point to the historical factors that were known to change mortality rate: improvement in nutrition, public health, urbanization, vaccination, and medical technology as evidence that in the past, government spending and economic growth were closely linked with better public health. However, they believe that this link no longer exists, citing vast discrepancies between the percent of GDP spent on healthcare between developed countries as an example of diminishing marginal returns. They assert that income, especially in the modern era, is relatively unimportant to the reduction of mortality rates as compared to institutional ability and political willingness to implement new technology.  “Booms, Busts, and Babies’ Health” (2004)  This paper was joint written with Rajeev Dehejia (Columbia University and NBER) and Ariana Lleras-Muney. It was published on The Quarterly Journal of Economics in 2004. This investigation was conducted through observing data from the Natality Files from 1975. The aim of this investigation was to find a relationship between the unemployment rate of the period that a baby is conceived and the characteristics, behaviours of parents and the babies health. The results was a positive correlation that those babies conceived during the period of high unemployment they were healthy in several ways. For example, there was reduced incidences of low and very low birth weight, fewer congenital malformations, and a reduced rate of post-neonatal mortality. This could be the result of better health behaviours amongst women during their pregnant months if it was a time of high unemployment. There was a correlation in the dimension of race in the selected women too. The results showed that less-educated single Black mothers were less likely to conceive during times of high unemployment. This raised the average health of Black babies. On the other hand, the mothers that were more likely to have babies during this time period was the less-educated White mothers. In addition Black mothers were less likely to take risky actions such as smoking, however it was the opposite result for Whites. What was concluded from this investigation was that skill depreciation plays an important role in fertility decisions and that there are clear differences between Black and White mothers. Secondly, this paper expressed the importance of taking time off work in order to commit to prenatal care as the results show the behavioural change of pregnant women in times of unemployment. There are reasons to suggest that improving the outcomes of birth could be a policy objective.

The type and only species is Convolosaurus marri. Discovery and naming Maps showing location of fossils In May 1985, James \\"Rusty\\" Branch at the Proctor Lake in Comanche County, Texas, discovered a dinosaur fossil site which was among the richest from the Lower Cretaceous of North America. The Shuler Museum of Paleontology, part of the Southern Methodist University at Dallas, excavated a large number of specimens on the southeastern bank of the lake, in the Camp Quarry and the North Quarry. The discovery was in 1988 reported in the scientific literature. Remains found were combined into three mounted skeletons displayed at respectively the Proctor Lake US Army Corps of Engineers Office at Proctor (based on specimen SMU 70456), the Perot Museum of Nature and Science, (a composite of specimens SMU 74087, SMU 74093 and SMU 74104), and the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History (based on specimen SMU 74663). The taxon, new to science, was informally indicated as the \\"Proctor Lake hypsilophodontid\\". Later it was understood that the Hypsilophodontidae are an invalid paraphyletic grouping. In 2019, the type species Convolosaurus marri was named and described by Kate A. Andrzejewski, Dale A. Winkler and Louis Leo Jacobs. The generic name is derived from the Latin convolare, \\"to flock\\", a reference to the dense concentration of fossils. The specific name honours Dr. Ray H. Marr who has propagated the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology at the SMU. The holotype, SMU 72834, was found in a layer of the Twin Mountains Formation dating from the Aptian. It consists of a partial skeleton with skull. It preserved the cranium with the lower jaws, the vertebral column up to the twenty-third tail vertebra, the shoulder girdle, the left arm, the right humerus, the pelvis, both thighbones, both shinbones and the left calfbone. It represents a subadult individual. A large amount of fossils have been referred to the species. In 2019 these amounted to 488 specimens, representing at least twenty-nine individuals, ranging from small juveniles to subadults. Almost the entire skeleton is now known. Description Skull reconstruction The holotype individual had an estimated length of between two-and-a-half and three metres. It was not yet fully grown; the adult size was considered to be unknown. Thighbones found vary between 51 and 315 millimetres in length. The describing authors established a number of distinguishing traits. One of these is an autapomorphy, a unique derived character. The premaxilla bears four teeth, which have a vertical trough on the outside. Additionally, a unique combination of traits is present that in themselves are not unique. Some of these traits are basal or symplesiomorphies. The premaxilla bears teeth. The entire upper rim of the eye socket is covered by two supraorbitals. Other traits are derived characters, indicating a position higher in the evolutionary tree. The roots of the maxillary teeth are curved. The neck vertebrae are opisthocoelous, convex at the front and concave at the rear. With the sacral vertebrae the neural spines have twice the height of the vertebral body. The rear end of the ischium is expanded into a \\"foot\\". Between the fronts of the condyles of the thighbone only a shallow groove is present. The prepubic process of the pubic bone is transversely flattened. Phylogeny Articulated specimen SMU 70456 While initially considered a member of the Hypsilophodontidae, Convolosaurus was in 2019 placed in the Ornithopoda in a basal position, above Hypsilophodon and below Thescelosaurus in the evolutionary tree. Previous analyses had found Thescelosaurus to be more basal than Hypsilophodon but this was now reversed as the possession by Convolosaurus of two supraorbitals, shared with Thescelosaurus, indicated that Hypsilophodon had lost this trait independently.

They were an important political force between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries. For a short time the Abdallabi succeeded in establishing an independent state, but they were defeated by the Funj Sultanate in 1504 and thereafter ruled over the Butana as vassals until the Egyptian conquest of 1820. Abdallah Jamma’a Abdallah Jamma’a, the eponymous ancestor of the Abdallabi tribe, was a Rufa'a Arab. His nickname (“the gatherer”) referred to the hordes of tribesmen he was able to gather for his campaigns. According to tradition, he settled in the Nile valley after coming from the east, consolidated his power and established his capital at Qarri, just north of the confluence of the two Niles, at the start of the route across the desert to Dongola. In the late 15th century he led a rebellion against the Christian kingdom of Alodia by the Muslim Arab tribes no longer willing to accept its rule or taxation. Under Abdallah's leadership Alodia and its capital Soba were destroyed, resulting in rich booty such as a \\"bejeweled crown\\" and a \\"famous necklace of pearls and rubies\\". There is a variant tradition that ascribes the fall of Alodia to the Funj, a group from the south led by their king Amara Dunqas, but most modern scholars agree that it fell to the Arabs. The Sudanese chronicler Katib al-Shuna makes brief reference to Abdallah Jamma’a cooperating with Amara Dunqas to fight the indigenous people of Alodia, but apparently the Funj were able to defeat the Abdallabis decisively in a battle near Arbaji in 1504. Abdallah Jamma’a ‘thus became as it were their lieutenant’. Abdallah Jamma’a’s sons were the founders of the leading Abdallabi clans - Ajib al-Kafuta of the Ajibab clan, Muhammad Dayoum of the Dayoumab, Idris al Anker of the Ankeryab, Muhammad Badirkoga of the Badirkogab, and Saba of the Sabab. ‘Ajib al-Kafuta When Abdallah Jamma‘a died in the reign of the Funj sultan Amara ii Abu Sikaykin (1557–69), his son ‘Ajib al-Kafuta was appointed to succeed him. In 1576 ‘Ajib defeated an Ottoman invasion and penetrated Egypt as far as Aswan, pushing Ottoman rule back to the First Cataract. In 1622 the northern Abdallabi frontier was finally settled at Hannik, just north of Dongola. Early in the seventeenth century ‘Ajib revolted and drove out the Funj sultan ‘Abd al-Qadir II, who fled to Ethiopia. The Funj sultans were at least nominally Muslims by this time, but Abdallabi tradition describes the revolt of ‘Ajib al-Kafuta as a holy war, followed by the building of mosques up the Blue Nile and in the Ethiopian marches. ‘Ajib is also represented as making the Pilgrimage to Mecca. ‘Abd al-Qadir‘s brother, ‘Adlan I, regained the throne, and in 1611-1612 defeated ‘Ajib at the battle of Karkoj, on the Blue Nile south of Sennar. ‘Ajib himself died in the battle, and his sons fled to Dongola. The mediation of a Muslim holy man, Shaykh Idris wad al-Arbab, obtained an amnesty for them. They returned to Qarri, where one of them, Muhammad al-Aqil, was appointed shaykh. Rulers 1611-1821 Muhammad al-Aqil did after ruling for twenty-five years and defeating an Ethiopian invasion. He was succeeded by his son Abdallah Al-Brins who reigned peacefully for seventeen years. After him ruled: *Hago ibn Uthman (five years) *Sheikh Ajib II (six years) *Mismar, brother of Sheikh Ajib (five years) *Sheikh Ali (seven years) *Sheikh Hamid as-Simeih (ten years), deposed and fled to Darfur *Sheikh Ajib III (twenty- five years) *Sheikh Bader, son of Sheikh Ajib (four years) *Sheikh Diab Abu Naib, son of Bader (nine yearsj *Sheikh Abdallah III, uncle of Diab (eight or more years), who moved the capital from Qarri to Halfayat al-Muluk and died during an invasion by the sultan of Darfur. *Sheikh Mismar II (five years) *Sheikh Nasir ibn Shammam (eight years), deposed and exiled to Sennar *Sheikh Ajib IV (‘The Elephant’) (twenty years) *Umar ash-Sheikh Abdallah (two years) *Sheikh Amin Mismar (twenty years) *Sheikh Abdallah IV (?? years) *Sheikh Nasir ibn Sheikh al-Amin (twenty-five years), rule at the time of the Egyptian conquest of Sudan (1820–1824) *Al-Amin, his eldest son, who ruled as an Egyptian vassal The Abdallabi polity The Funj Sultanate was not a centralized state, and much power was held by vassals. The ‘Abdallabi shaykhs of Qarri, who bore the title manjil or manjilak, were viceroys of the north and the most important these vassals. The power of the ‘Abdallabi depended on the ability of their mounted soldiers to raise taxes from settled farmers, and to exercise some control over the cattle nomads of the plains. An important source of revenue was customs dues; the destruction of Christian Alodia meant that new trade and pilgrimage routes crossing Sudan from east to west began to open up, connecting Mecca and Medina with the Lake Chad region. Neither the Funj nor their Abdallabi viceroys were able to prevent the Shaigiya tribe from throwing off Funj rule in the seventeenth century. Some degree of Abdallabi authority over the Beja tribes of the northeast is perhaps suggested by the legend of a marriage between a woman of the Amerar Beja and either ‘Ajib al- Kafuta or his brother. In the middle of the 18th century, during the reign of Sheikh Abdallah III, the capital of the Abdallabi realm was moved south from Qarri to Halfayat al-Muluk, just north of modern Khartoum. This move appears to have been motivated by both political and commercial reasons. Qarri was a customs post on caravan routes but had little trade of its own, while the lands around it were not particularly productive. The Abdallabis kept their base at Halfayat al-Muluk until the Egyptian invasion, but by that time Qarri was in ruins. The Turkiyyah Sheikh Nasir ibn Sheikh al-Amin was near the end of his life when Egyptian armies under Ismail Kamil Pasha invaded Sudan in 1820. In 1821 Sheikh Nasir submitted to Egyptian rule without resistance, and sent his son his eldest son Al-Amin to accompany the invaders as they continued their campaign south towards Sennar, leaving a garrison behind in Halfaya. Soon after they left, Sheikh al-Amin died and Al-Amin was appointed to succeed him. However in 1822 the Ja'alin tribe rebelled in Shendi, killing Ismail, and the Abdallabis in Halfaya likewise rose up and killed the Egyptian garrison. Muhammad Khusraw, the Defterdar Bey, brought Egyptian forces back from Kordofan and Al-Amin fled to Gallabat. A decade later the Egyptian government pardoned Al-Amin’s cousin Miri and allowed him to return to Halfaya as Sheikh. He was succeeded briefly by Sheikh Muhammad Nasir, and then by Muhammad Nasir’s brother Idris Nasir, who was held in high regard by the government despite conspiring with the Egyptian viceroy to remove Sudan from Egyptian rule and pledge direct allegiance to the Ottoman Empire. He was succeeded by Sheikh Jamma’a Sheikh al-Amin, who was an army commander when the Mahdiyyah broke out in 1881 and died on campaign in Kordofan. His successor Nasir Jamma’a managed to retain his authority over the Abdallabis throughout the Mahdiyya and died resisting the Anglo-Egyptian conquest of Sudan. His successor Sheikh al-Amin Umar however made his peace with the Condominium government. Sheikh Muhammad al-Sheikh Jamma’a, his successor, was awarded a medal by King George V during a royal visit to Port Sudan in 1912.

Following three successive swing and jazz albums released throughout the 2010s, Bigger Life heralded a return to the punk rock influences which defined the Daddies' earliest albums, featuring a dominant musical focus on ska, ska punk and psychobilly as well as lyrical content both critically and satirically addressing contemporary American politics. Overview Bigger Life marked a return to the Daddies' eclectic multi-genre album format, their first such record since Susquehanna in 2008. Described by singer-songwriter Steve Perry as \\"a throwback to our Ferociously Stoned days, mixed with our skacore influence of the Kids on the Street era\\", much of the music on Bigger Life is influenced by ska and punk rock, exploring sub-genres including ska punk, psychobilly and Celtic punk while also featuring brief stylistic detours into electro-funk (\\"Schizo\\") and the Daddies' best-known musical staples of swing (\\"The Fixer\\") and jazz (\\"Bigger Life\\"). Lyrically, Bigger Life is one of the Daddies' most overtly political albums, addressing such topics as race relations, class consciousness, the opioid crisis and the erosion of democratic ideals. Perry further elaborated on these themes in an article by Paste about Trump-era protest music, stating his intent with Bigger Life on being \\"deeply critical of racist and authoritarian elements in the U.S., while also being empathetic to working- class frustration, given the reality that the working class is being economically pressured and manipulated simultaneously by an emboldened nationalist movement and their sources of propaganda\\". In an entry from the Daddies' official mailing list, Perry noted that he was significantly influenced by The Kinks 1969 concept album Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire) while writing Bigger Life, as well as the political satire of the Roman poet Juvenal and German dadaist artist George Grosz.Perry, Steve (April 12, 2019). \\"Diesel PunX\\" Single Available Now\\". Cherry Poppin Daddies Mailing List Production history After the release of White Teeth, Black Thoughts in 2013, the Daddies spent the next several years on the road and in the studio focusing exclusively on swing and jazz music, releasing the Rat Pack tribute Please Return the Evening and the Tin Pan Alley tribute The Boop- A-Doo in 2014 and 2016, respectively, each with an accompanying stage show showcasing the material. In a 2014 interview with The Huffington Post, singer- songwriter Steve Perry mentioned beginning work on new, non-swing original material, describing his ambitions of making a politically-oriented \\"psychobilly/Zappa/American Idiot/R. Crumb-type record\\" and emphasizing an interest in utilizing rockabilly and psychobilly. Fewer updates were given on the status of this album as the Daddies continued to promote their tribute albums, though Perry confirmed on Twitter in January 2016 that he was still writing and that the new songs were \\"rockin & funky\\", comparing them to the band's debut album Ferociously Stoned. By Spring 2017, an article by The Register-Guard revealed a working title of Big Mouth Royalty, as well as a description of its musical content as \\"swing-ska-rockabilly-psychobilly\\". During this time, the Daddies embarked on a tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of their 1997 Zoot Suit Riot compilation, where two new ska punk songs - \\"Big Mouth Royalty\\" and \\"Steamrolled\\" - were debuted. In February 2018, Perry publicly announced on the Daddies' social media that his wife Yvette had been diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer. As a result, band activity was placed on hiatus as Perry acted as his wife's caretaker. As the year progressed and Yvette Perry responded positively to cancer treatments and surgery, the Daddies resumed sporadic touring and recording at a slower pace. The album - eventually titled Bigger Life - is dedicated to Yvette \\"Cherry\\" Perry. On May 8, 2018, Perry announced on Twitter that mixing had begun on Bigger Life. The album was finally and formally announced on March 12, 2019 with the release of the album's first single and music video, the ska punk song \\"Gym Rat\\", along with a confirmed release date of June 14. Release and promotion Bigger Life was released on June 14, 2019. Singles and music videos As of June 2019, three music videos have been released in promotion of Bigger Life, each co-directed by Daddies frontman Steve Perry and Jesse Locke of the Bend, Oregon-based production company AMZ Productions, who also produced the music videos for the Daddies' 2013 album White Teeth, Black Thoughts. \\"Gym Rat\\" was released as Bigger Lifes first music video on March 12, 2019 and issued as a downloadable single on March 15, marking the first ska single of the Daddies' career and their second non-ska single after the glam rock-styled \\"Diamond Light Boogie\\" from 2000's Soul Caddy. Boasting a \\"pummeling, burly skacore vibe\\" which Perry likened to \\"AC/DC meets Fishbone\\", \\"Gym Rat\\" is a satire of fitness culture which Perry clarified as condemning \\"the awful 'rule' that I believe many people in this culture have deeply internalized; which is that until your body is 100% perfect you will never feel worthy of love\\". The music video, shot at Genuine Fitness in Eugene, Oregon, depicts the band members clad in exaggerated 1970s fashion performing the song alongside a variety of male and female bodybuilders. The album's second music video, \\"Diesel PunX\\", was released on April 9 and issued as a single on April 12. On May 7, the Daddies released the third music video from Bigger Life, the Celtic punk-styled \\"Yankee Pride\\", with the single following on May 10. Perry explained his intent with the song was delving deeper into the roots of the term \\"Yankee\\", a pejorative term for New Englanders which Perry - himself a New York native - associated with a sense of \\"stoicism\\", intending to \\"stir echoes of the past in response to the challenges and ethical waywardness of the present [...] to recall the Enlightenment values that engendered this Yankee experiment; the more upright values of freedom, tolerance and respect for all regardless of race or religion - of grit in the face of adversity\\". The music video portrays the Daddies performing the song in an industrial warehouse wearing a variety of costumes influenced by 1930s pulp magazine heroes such as Doc Savage, The Shadow and The Phantom, which Perry attributed to his admiration of \\"deliciously weird\\" bygone pop culture.Perry, Steve (May 7, 2019). \\"Yankee Pride\\" Video Premiere.

Kommersant.ru. 4 May 1992 In December of 1995 an initiative group of voters nominated General Viktor Chechevatov as a presidential candidate for the 1996 Russian presidential election, but Chechevatov soon withdrew his nomination in favor of Boris Yeltsin. Earlier in 1995 there was information that he was offered a post of First Deputy Commander of Russian Ground Forces in place of the sacked Eduard Vorobyov. Also, there was an incident with his son Andrei Chechevatov (also military officer) who was involved in street shooting as part of road rage which led to casualties, but no prosecutions against Andrei. Yeltsin met with Chechevatov in May of 1996 when he was on official trip to China. Following the presidential elections in July of 1996 President of Russia Boris Yeltsin personally has invited Chechevatov to Kremlin when an issue has been raised about appointing a candidate to the post of Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation after dismissal of Pavel Grachev due to the First Chechen War. At that time mass media have informed about offer to Chechevatov to take the post of minister and his refusal from it. After the meeting with Yeltsin, the post of minister was given to Igor Radionov. On 27 February 1997 Yeltsin again met with Chechevatov in Kremlin when his candidacy was presented to post of the commander-in-chief of Ground Forces, but was not approved. Later in 1997 Chechevatov participated in scandalous meeting of the Russia Defense Council at which were sacked from their posts Minister of Defense Igor Radionov and Chief of General Staff Viktor Samsonov and during which right in the course of the meeting Yeltsin offered Chechevatov to take the post of Chief of General Staff. In respond the General asked President about a five-minute confidential conversation, after which the issue about his new post was never raised again. What they talked about is not known, but the General Staff office was headed not by Chechvatov, but Anatoly Kvashnin. In the beginning of 1998 Chechevatov turned out to be involved in a conflict situation between Naval and Ground forces caused by the actions of the Ministry of Defense to \\"optimize the structure of the armed forces\\". Due to the start of the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, in March of 1999 Chechevatov declared that he is ready to head any military formation of volunteer or regular armed forces to help Yugoslavia and called other volunteers to go to Yugoslavia. In his letter to Yeltsin, Colonel General Chechevatov stated that bombing of Yugoslavia may turned out in the near future to be just a rehearsal of similar strikes on Russia. In context of the Kosovo issue, the name of Chechevatov also was raised in negotiations between Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton when after complaining to Clinton that communists pursue Yeltsin to send forces to Yugoslavia, President of Russia told that he even fired Chechevatov who wanted to deploy a battalion to help Milošević.Russia is not going to take Sevastopol, Putin is a real democrat.

Originally established in the 1960s, it is the largest twin registry in the world. It is widely used for medical research, with about thirty active research projects using data from the study as of 2019. As of 2012, it contained a total of 194,000 twins, 75,000 of whom were of a known zygosity. In principle, it contains records of every twin born in Sweden since 1886. History The Swedish Twin Registry was first developed in the late 1950s to study the effects of environmental factors, like alcohol and tobacco, on chronic disease risk while controlling for potential genetic confounding factors. When the registry was first started, researchers contacted every parish in Sweden to obtain records of multiple births between 1886 and 1925. The researchers then used this information to develop a list of potential twins, whose actual twin status was verified in 1959. In 1960 and 1961, a questionnaire asking about demographic and health-related information was sent to all living same-sex twins that had been identified in Sweden at the time. The registry was officially established in 1961. Additional questionnaires were sent out in 1963 and 1967, and select twin pairs also responded to a further questionnaire in 1970. By 1970, it was estimated that the STR had included 95% of all twins born in Sweden from 1886 to 1925. More recently, the STR has obtained records of twin births in Sweden from the country's National Board of Health and Welfare. In 2004, the registry began inviting all identified nine-year-old twins in the country to participate in its Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS). Cohorts The Swedish Twin Registry initially consisted of three cohorts of twins: those born in 1886–1925, those born in 1926–58, and those born in 1959–90. More recently, STR researchers have contacted and screened twins born from 1959 to 1985. Over 25,000 of these twins were later enrolled in the Study of Twin Adults: Genes and Environment (STAGE), which was the first STR-based study to use an online questionnaire.

The games are named after Trump's Castle hotel-casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and were released for Amiga, Apple II, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Commodore 128, and DOS. Games Each of the games were published by Capstone Software, a division of IntraCorp. Trump Castle (1989) Trump Castle: The Ultimate Casino Gambling Simulation was released in 1989, for Amiga, Apple II, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Commodore 128, and DOS. In the United Kingdom, the game was released in February 1990. In 1991, the game was republished by Capstone along with two non-gambling games as a compilation titled The Big Deal. Trump Castle was also republished by Capstone as Casinos of the World, a 1992 compilation that included two other gambling games. The game is set at Trump's Castle hotel- casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and includes six different gambling games: blackjack, craps, keno, roulette, video poker, and nine distinct slot machines. Each of the games follow the rules and regulations established by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, except for keno, which, in reality, was not available in New Jersey casinos. The Trump Castle logo is featured onscreen during each of the gambling games. The game manual includes a shortened version of Trump Castle's Guide to Gambling, which explains the rules of blackjack, craps, and roulette. The game also includes coupons for the real Trump Castle. IntraCorp unveiled the game at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1989. It was the first software game associated with Donald Trump, and was the first game to be released by Capstone. The game was intended to promote the Trump's Castle resort. Roger Wagner, the president of Trump's Castle, said, \\"We always like to keep our name, our logo or our picture out there in front of the consumer. Some of the people who buy the software may never have been in Atlantic City. After they see the picture of the Castle and try their hand at the games they might come here and try the real thing.\\" L.R. Shannon of The New York Times called it an \\"entertaining and educational\\" program, while South Bend Tribune noted issues with installing the game. Scott Mace of inCider praised the game: \\"To use one of Donald Trump's favorite words, this game is quality.\\" Daniel Heneghan of The Press of Atlantic City wrote that the graphics \\"aren't the 'ultimate' and the different commands needed to run the different games can be confusing, but they do offer a reasonable simulation of the games.\\" Andrew Baartz of The Australian Commodore and Amiga Review considered the game addictive and praised its realism, calling it the \\"finest\\" gambling simulation available. .info rated the game two out of five stars and criticized the graphics, sound effects, and the lack of options, and called it \\"easily the worst\\" gambling simulation ever released for the Amiga. The magazine stated that the game lacked realism, noting that the reels of the slot machine games spin up rather than down. Bob Guerra of Run criticized the game for poor graphics, animation, and sound effects, and stated that the slot machines did not look realistic. He praised the graphics of the roulette wheel, but otherwise considered the overall game to be \\"far from ultimate.\\" Alan Emrich of Computer Gaming World also felt that the game fell short of its goal to be the ultimate gambling simulation, and stated that other computer programs, focusing on individual gambling games, did a better job of recreating the experience. Trump Castle II (1991) Trump Castle II was released in 1991, for Amiga and DOS. The game includes baccarat, blackjack, craps, roulette, slots, and video poker, all following the rules of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. The player is initially given $1,000 to play the various games. The player begins in the lobby of Trump Castle, and uses a point-and-click interface to navigate toward the gambling games or to other parts of the resort, including a hotel suite, the pool, and a restaurant; these areas, represented by digitized images of the real resort, include characters who make comments through popup speech balloons. The game also features a multiplayer option. Included with the game was the Trump Castle Gaming Guide, which is also used by the player to bypass the game's copy protection. Also included was a coupon for a one-night stay at Trump Castle's hotel. Capstone released two standalone add-on disks, Poker and Lots-O-$lot$, which were also compatible with Trump Castle II and its predecessor. Michael S. Lasky of Computer Gaming World called the game a \\"highly\\" improved version of its predecessor, and praised the save feature and multiplayer. However, Lasky stated that the quality of the graphical interface for each gambling game varied, with table games looking \\"uncannily\\" realistic, unlike the slot and video poker games; the latter games were also criticized for their poor payoffs. Lasky considered the copy protection to be \\"elaborate and annoying\\", and stated that the popup comments \\"are always inane and often sexist.\\" He wrote that the table dealers look \\"real enough\\" but criticized the sound of card shuffling. Lasky believed the game would be appealing as an educational program for people considering a visit to a real casino, while experienced gamblers would likely be more interested in real gambling. Despite the \\"gimmicky and brazen advertisements\\", Lasky wrote that Trump Castle II offered a \\"modicum of casino fun\\" without the risk of losing real money. Dennis Lynch of the Chicago Tribune praised the game and called it \\"as slick as the Donald's hairdo.\\" Tom Malcom of .info rated the game three out of five stars and considered the animations to be \\"amateurish,\\" while criticizing the gambling games, including their sluggish pace. Malcom concluded that people other than \\"fanatical\\" Trump fans would be frustrated by the game's \\"terminal slowness.\\" Jeff James of Amazing Computing reviewed the Amiga version and noted that it could not be installed to a hard drive. In addition, he considered the animations of casino visitors and dealers to be \\"a little coarse and grainy,\\" and criticized the sluggish pace of the gambling games. Because of these issues, he believed that the game may only appeal to avid gamblers. Rick Ratliff of Detroit Free Press stated that people would \\"despise\\" Trump Castle II if they \\"hate spending lots of money for a computer game that turns out to be a flagrant and relentless advertisement\\", stating that every aspect of the game \\"is a shameless attempt to dazzle you with the wonders of this over-glitzed hotel.\\" Ratliff considered the gambling games to be \\"perhaps the most insidious\\" aspect of Trump Castle II, and rated the game zero out of four stars. Jeane DeCoster and David Crook of the Los Angeles Times considered it an \\"absolutely awful excuse\\" for a computer game, calling it an \\"absurd tour\\" of Trump Castle and criticizing the \\"promo-style\\" images of the resort's areas. DeCoster and Crook stated that the gambling games were done well enough that they might satisfy people who enjoy gambling. However, they rated the overall game one star out of five and concluded that there \\"is no excuse for a program this dumb.\\" In 2016, Nick Thorpe of Retro Gamer reviewed the Amiga version and called it an \\"okay gambling game\\" with \\"some odd idiosyncracies.\\" He considered the game \\"oddly-coloured and not particularly pleasant to look at,\\" stating that it did not fully show off the Amiga's graphical capabilities. Thorpe also considered the gambling to be pointless as there is no ultimate goal other than accumulating wealth, although he considered some of the popup comments to be \\"kind of amusing.\\" Trump Castle II and its predecessor were both successful, leading Capstone to publish a sequel. Trump Castle 3 (1993) Trump Castle 3 was released in 1993, for DOS. Gambling games include baccarat, blackjack, craps, keno, and roulette. The game also features 36 slot machines, and five poker games: five- card draw, five-card stud, seven-card stud, Texas hold 'em, and video poker. In reality, poker games were illegal in New Jersey. The player can customize their character's poker face to include features such as facial hair and sunglasses. The game includes multiplayer for two players via a modem, while online network play allowed up to four players. To provide a realistic casino experience, a bar maid occasionally asks the player if they are interested in purchasing an alcoholic beverage. Mark Alan Willett of Computer Gaming World criticized the game's long installation time, and wrote that the game \\"attempts a lot but fails at most of it\\". Willett praised the appearance of the blackjack and baccarat tables, but was disappointed by the \\"rough-drawn\\" graphics of gaming chips and the \\"oddly-cartoonish\\" shuffling of cards. Willett also criticized the various slot machine games for their lack of modern design and their similar appearances to each other, and noted that their reels spin up rather than down. Willett further wrote that there \\"is no way to intelligently\\" determine which slot machines pay more, \\"So, playing them is an even worse risk than in a real casino.\\" Willett criticized the poker games as well, stating that the computer players \\"are unable to present a truly human face,\\" whereas real poker requires evaluation of other players' facial expressions. Dennis Lynch of the Chicago Tribune praised the graphics and the multiplayer option, considering them to be the game's \\"big draws\\". Paul C. Schuytema of Compute! wrote that Trump Castle 3 \\"comes as close as possible to simulating a real casino\\" and stated that the gambling games play \\"very well\\".

History Barry and the Penetrators is a five-piece reggae rock band from the Jersey Shore, that formed in 1998 not much time after Bradley Nowell from Sublime passed away in 1996. The group is called a fun mix of reggae, punk, ska and dub, and a \\"punk-dub powerhouse,\\" and they draw comparison to the music of Sublime and Red Hot Chili Peppers. Noted for their catchy reggae guitar riffs, thumping bass lines and melodic vocal hooks, Barry and the Penetrators cite musical influence from Bad Brains, Yellowman, Social Distortion, Lee Scratch Perry, Black Sabbath and Bouncing Souls. The original formation of the group was loosely established within the now-defunct Casino Skate Park, in Asbury Park, New Jersey, where vocalist Barry Peterson worked, and which guitarist Mark Sisom and bassist Charlie Schaefer frequented. They were joined by Eric Porcaro to complete the rhythm section, followed by keyboardist Jeanna Peterson. One of their first write-ups for a performance on the Asbury Park Boardwalk describes Peterson as a \\"Sam Kinison and Mike Ness mix!\\" The band has been sponsored by Foster's Lager, Lost Clothing, Electric Sunglasses, Penetrator Kustoms and Eastern Line Surf Shop. Their ten-track debut album, Beaver Country, was self-released in 2001, and by 2005, it had sold several thousand copies. Peterson recalls in an interview, \\"back then, there was no Facebook, there was barely Myspace. At the time, that was the last era of selling and buying CDs.\\" In 2003, Barry and the Penetrators self- released their second full length album entitled, Addicted. The Courier Times calls the album \\"tasty\\" and the song \\"All Around the World\\" \\"a hysterical escapade.\\" They received the Top Ska award from the Asbury Music Awards in 2003. A 2005 piece on the group notes that Peterson's \\"stage charisma and freestyling skills [are what] really set the band apart and make for a raucously entertaining evening.\\" Peterson served as MC for the 2007 Asbury Music Awards, and the group received the Beyond Asbury award, for longstanding artists that have taken their music to the national level. The concert booker for the Stone Pony, a venue which the band frequently performs at, says their \\"cool blend of dub ska and new-school reggae is guaranteed to keep you moving.\\" The band toured the Southeast region of the United States in early 2005, before returning to Jersey to open for Blowfly on 14 April at Asbury Lanes. Barry and the Penetrators performed at the 2008 Bamboozle music festival. Suburban Noize Records Barry and the Penetrators signed with Suburban Noize Records, and released their third full length album, entitled Tales from Dirty Jersey, in 2008. Asbury Park Press calls the record \\"their most mature album to date,\\" with Peterson saying that \\"I've grown up a lot.\\" By 2011, their first record had sold over ten-thousand copies, and the group was recognized as \\"dominating the Jersey coastline with a blend of dub reggae that you didn't know existed anymore, combining it with loud, dynamic punk rock and turning any old show into a full-on party.\\" They released the single \\"Wicked Game\\" in 2011, along with a music video, which contains footage of the band at the beach, swimming in a pool, and riding along the coastline. Barry and the Penetrators have won several Asbury Music Awards throughout the years. They have shared the stage with the Bouncing Souls, the Descendents, Dick Dale, Burning Spear, Fishbone, Pepper, Eek-A-Mouse, Slightly Stoopid, The English Beat, Third World, Yellowman, The Wailers, and many more noteworthy bands.

Comparable to the 1993 Storm of the Century, the storm was labeled a bomb cyclone after barometric pressure readings dropped in excess of over a 24-hour period. After the storm entered Colorado from its origination in Arizona, the pressure dropped more than and rapidly intensified over the western High Plains. The severe storm set new all-time record low barometric pressure readings in Colorado, Kansas and New Mexico. The storm itself killed only one person in Colorado, but flooding caused by the storm killed at least 3, one in Iowa and at least two in Nebraska and left ~140,000 without power in Texas. Meteorological history The system originated from an extratropical low that developed in the Gulf of Alaska on March 8. Over the next two days, the system moved southeastward, bringing rainy and windy conditions to California on March 11, and the system was named \\"Winter Storm Ulmer\\" by The Weather Channel later that day, due to the storm's expected impacts. Early on March 12, the system moved onshore in Southern California, subsequently developing into a strong Colorado Low over the Southwestern United States. Late on March 12 through early March 13, the already-unusually strong Colorado low underwent explosive intensification, with the storm's minimum central pressure falling from to in roughly 16 hours, more than meeting the criteria for a weather bomb or \\"bomb cyclone\\" (a storm that undergoes a pressure drop of at least in 24 hours). The storm's tight pressure gradient allowed wind gusts in excess of 100 mph to develop in the Texas Panhandle. As the storm headed northward towards the Great Lakes, blizzard conditions were reported in several States, from Colorado all the way north into North Dakota and flooding hit the southern portions of those states. The storm also began weakening. Impacts United States At least 1 million acres of U.S. farmland, in nine major grain producing states, were flooded after the storm. Alabama Damage, potentially from tornadoes, was reported in nine counties in the state. So far, damage has been linked to tornadoes in only three counties. Colorado The storm underwent explosive cyclogenesis as it tracked across the Southern Rocky Mountains. Colorado experienced heavy snow and hurricane-force wind gusts from the blizzard, up to as much as . of snow was recorded in the Denver region with reported in Nederland, Colorado. The storm brought wind gusts that exceeded Category 2 hurricane strength with gusts reaching recorded at Peterson Air Force Base and a gust recorded in Glen Haven. A Category 1 force wind gust of was reported at Denver International Airport. The combination of high winds and snowy conditions forced the cancellation of all flights in and out of Denver International Airport most of the day March 13th and a third of the flights scheduled for March 14th. The rapid intensification of the storm over Colorado may have set a new all-time record low pressure record of in La Junta, which is somewhat lower than the previous record for Colorado set in 1973 at . Numerous vehicular accidents were reported with at least 1,000 people stranded on the highways, requiring rescue by the National Guard and emergency services providers. A Colorado State Patrol officer was killed by one driver who lost control of his vehicle on Interstate 76 northeast of Denver. Indiana The town of Lowell may have been impacted by a tornado. Nonetheless, a tornado warning was issued for part of the state. Iowa Iowa was also affected by heavy rains and flooding, closing parts of all nine state parks. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds signed an emergency disaster proclamation March 14th. One man was killed in Iowa. Flooding across Iowa was described as \\"catastrophic\\" especially in the Missouri River Valley south of Council Bluffs, Iowa. There, at least 30 levee failures flooded towns and highways. Interstate 29 was closed from Council Bluffs to the Missouri state border and from there to St. Joseph, Missouri, with portions of the interstate under of water. Kentucky The state was affected by severe thunderstorms that produced several tornadoes. Most notably, an EF-2 spotted near West Paducah, strong enough to rip part of the roof off of the Mount Zion church. Other tornadoes were also spotted, one in Morgansfield and the other 7 miles north of Corydon. Kansas Meteorologists were forecasting a record low barometric pressure reading as the storm passed over Kansas. The current record set in 1878 at and the storm was forecast to have a slightly lower reading, the equivalent of a Category 2 Hurricane. Dodge City, Kansas reported a new record low pressure. Michigan Upwards of 70 buildings in Vernon were damaged by an EF2 tornado late on March 14th. Strong winds and flooding also affected the state. Nebraska The Spencer dam as seen in 2010 was destroyed by flooding waters of the Niobrara River Western Nebraska experienced severe wind gusts and more than a foot of snow in some localities. A wind gust of was recorded in Hemingford, Nebraska and Interstate 80 was closed from Kearney, Nebraska to the Wyoming border. The Interstate 80 closure in Nebraska along with the portions closed in Wyoming spanned a distance of more than . In the eastern half of the state, rapidly melting snows along with frozen rivers caused record setting flooding in many rivers and streams. On the Niobrara River, the Spencer Dam collapsed and the unregulated flooding destroyed 3 bridges downstream including the Highway 281 bridge. In east central Nebraska, residents along the flooded Missouri, Platte and Elkhorn Rivers were forced to evacuate as some locals experienced all-time record flooding. The city of Norfolk, Nebraska evacuated a third of its residents. The Platte and Elkhorn Rivers had overflowed their levees in the greater Omaha, Nebraska region and some communities were put under a mandatory evacuation order. The Platte River at numerous sites had reached flooding of \\"historical proportions\\" with some sites breaking all-time record flood levels by as much as . By March 15, access to the city of Fremont was blocked due to all roads being closed in and out of the city. This remained the case days later with national guard military convoys being set up to get food and other supplies into the city. Offutt Air Force Base had extensive flooding from the Platte River and of their only runway was covered in water while 30 buildings had been flooded. As of March 18, 2 persons were reported to have drowned in Nebraska and 2 more are missing and presumed dead. On March 18, Nebraska governor Pete Ricketts stated that the floods caused \\"the most extensive damage our state has ever experienced.\\" Losses from flooding in Nebraska alone exceeds $1.3 Billion, including $449 million in infrastructure damage, $440 million of crop damage, $400 million of lost cattle. More than 2,000 homes and 340 businesses were damaged or destroyed, costing the state another $85 million. In the central parts of Nebraska, large ice slabs were reported to have destroyed crops, and Sub-Zero conditions often hurt livestock. An additional round of Flooding is said to have wiped out some farms for years.Smith, Mitch. “'It's Probably Over for Us': Record Flooding Pummels Midwest When Farmers Can Least Afford It.” Google, New York Times, 25 Mar. 2019, www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/us/nebraska- floods.amp.html. New Mexico A new all-time low barometric pressure reading for New Mexico was set in Clayton and wind gusts of were recorded in Cloudcroft, New Mexico. In addition, powerful thunderstorms moving through the state spawned several tornadoes, damaging many homes. Oklahoma A high wind warning was issued by the National Weather Service as thunderstorms with 50 mph (80 km/h) wind gusts downed power lines, tree branches, some fences, and caused other kinds of minor wind damage across Oklahoma City and its suburbs. South Dakota The City of Pierre achieved full on blizzard conditions (frequent wind gusts above 35 mph/56 km/h producing visibility lower than 1/4 mile/400 metres for at least 3 hours). These conditions prompted the closure of the I-90 from Wall to Chamberlain. 18.3 inches (46 cm) of snow fell in Kadoka and winds gusted to 70 mph (112 km/h) in Rapid City. Texas At San Augustin Pass and at Pine Springs, Texas wind gusts of respectively were recorded. At Grand Prairie's municipal airport, a wind gust of 109 mph (175 km/h) tore through, flipping several small airplanes. Winds were great enough in the Texas panhandle to blow over numerous tractor- trailers. Wyoming Blizzard conditions were reported for all of eastern Wyoming, especially in the southeastern sections of the state from Casper to the state capital in Cheyenne. Snowfalls in excess of one foot were recorded in several locations with wind gusts of in Carbon County. Both Interstate 25 and 80 were closed through most of the state. An additional snow squall moved across Southeast Wyoming Friday through Sunday, adding 1-2 inches of snow. Due to the location of the low, many areas were above freezing and had rain instead, which prompted the NWS to issue Flood watches and warnings in the area.Randall, Doug. “National Weather Service Warns Of Southeast Wyoming Flooding.” KGAB AM 650, 20 Mar. 2019, kgab.com/national-weather-service-warns- of-southeast-wyoming-flooding/. Canada Atlantic Canada The storm brought above seasonal temperatures to much of Atlantic Canada, along with soaking rains. Although, Labrador was affected by heavy snow with up to 30 cm (1 foot) of snow in some areas. Afterwards, the storm moved out to sea. Ontario and Quebec The provinces experienced their warmest day in weeks, sparking the risk for isolated severe thunderstorms in extreme southwestern Ontario. These storms triggered flooding along the Humber River, resulting in an evacuation order for 200 people. Behind the storm's cold front, cold, below seasonal temperatures returned along with snowsqualls in the snow belts. Meanwhile, Northern Ontario was hit with heavy snow and strong winds, producing blizzard-like conditions.

It contributes to the prestige of many official ceremonies and gives honor to high ranking French personalities. It frequently represents the French Republic abroad in military tattoos and military parades in countries such as the United States, Canada, South Korea, Israel, India, Bulgaria, and Russia. Since 1991, the band has been located at the Camp de Satory in Versailles, Yvelines. Operationally, it is assigned to the Army Music Command. History The band was created in Rochefort, Charente-Maritime in 1945 by Jean Avignon, under the name of the Colonial Brass Band. A year later, it came under the control of the 3rd Battalion of Colonial Infantry and moved to Limoges Barracks. That same year, its first official performance took place on Bastille Day. At the end of 1947, the brass band increased in personnel and moved to Clignancourt Barracks, which was the headquarters of the staff of the 1st Colonial Half Brigade. In 1952, the band was put under the jurisdiction of the Marines. By 1958, the band, which at this time renamed to the Principal Music Band of the French Army (), had become an important component of Army life and culture, becoming the de facto seniormost band in the service branch. As the army's main harmonic band, it performed at all types of grand ceremonies, such as the Bastille Day Military Parade and Victory in Europe Day celebrations. In 1978, Minister of Defence Yvon Bourges ordered that the band be enlarged so it could be the largest of the five musical formations in the army. In 1997, it was officially designated as the army's senior band. In 2016, as part of special reforms within the Army Music Command, the band was put back under the Marine chain of command.https://www.defense.gouv.fr/terre/actu-terre/les-musiques-de- l-armee-de-terre-se-reaccordentMusique principale de l'armée de Terre Composition The band is composed of 99 professional musicians and NCOs who are recruited into the following ensembles of the band by competition or audition: *Ceremonial Band - Performs during military parades, state visits, state dinners, and other solemn events where the band can perform stationary and non-stationary drill. *Wind Orchestra - Deals with a broad repertoire covering all classical and modern literature. The ensemble pays particular attention to so-called light music, thus promoting the balance between the popular tradition of the concert and the modernism of a repertoire that is often unpublished. *Special Groups - the wind quintet, brass quintet or saxophone quartet offer a more different approach to performances in more restricted and enclosed settings by differentiating the style and instrumentation of the group. The string quartet performs at prestigious events like receptions in embassies or ministries, often performing more classical music than the other ensembles, although it does indeed have a broad repertoire.

Biography  Zhu was born in Shou County, Anhui, China in 1951. She earned a master's degree in economics from Wuhan University in 1981. Thereafter, she started research work in the Institute of Economics at Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. She completed her doctorate in agricultural economics at the University of Hohenheim in 1988. After her graduation in 1988, she went back to China and continued her economic research in the Institute of Economics at Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Previously, she served as an executive member at International Association of Agricultural Economics (IAAE), vice president of the Chinese Agricultural Economics Association; and had joined the research group of Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations. Currently, she serves as the deputy director and researcher at the Institute of Economics in Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; was appointed as member of theoretical economics consultative group at Academic Degree Commission of the State Council and member of professional advisory committee of the State Council's aid-the-poor leading group. In order to find a way to alleviate poverty in the rural area, she proposed the idea of combining relief and employment as well as improving infrastructure and social services. In her research of health economics, she revealed the responsibility-defect of the government in the field of rural cooperative medical service, public house care and peasant-workers' medical insurance. Throughout the process of introducing the gender perspective into economic research, she used statistical models to analyze the gender inequality in farm-land allocation, basic medical care and endowment insurance.  Research  Zhu's research interests are primarily in the area of development microeconomics, focuses on income distribution, poverty reduction, social security and country development, pay attention to tracking investigation on survival and development of countryside poverty group, peasant workers, women and minorities. Her research methods are primarily based on gathering and studying existing articles and historical data, then carrying out on-the-spot interview and sampling survey. By using theory and statistic method, she emphatically analyzes first-hand data and cases, then theoretically explain the arising problems in the transformation and development process of socioeconomic systems. So far, as the first author, Zhu has published three English monographs; as first author and second author, has published seven Chinese monographs, more than one hundred Chinese papers and more than ten English papers. According to literature center of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, between 1995 and 2009, some of her work has been reprinted, extracted and edited under permission. Following are some of her main research area: \\"The impact of rural economic reform on the peasant households' economic safety\\" From 1895 to 1990, this research was supported by central rural research centre. The main discover of this research is that the implement of household responsibility system and the detribalization of people's commune incent peasants improving the efficiency of resource allocation, in the meantime, leave a blank in agriculture infrastructure construction and village public service supplying system. At the same time, a single peasant is facing increasing uncertainty and risks. She referred to the experience of developed countries and the creation of Chinese peasants’ system and came up with key solutions. The first solution is to reinforced the public investment and service function of the government. The second solution is letting the village-autonomy to play a role. With the deformation detribalization of people's commune, community organizations could supplement partial functions of basic regime in the field of public affairs. Under the condition that the market mechanism is not fully developed, community organizations can partially supplement the role of the market in the process of production factor allocation; the third solution is to promote the development of farmers' cooperative organizations. In her papers under this topic, two of which were respectively published in the British Journal of Development Studies, 1990, issue 2, and Cambridge Journal of Economics, 1993. Adopted in phase 4. \\"The issue of income inequality\\" This research study has continued from 1985 to the present, mainly through statistical analysis of sample survey data to identify factors that significantly affect income inequality. In the research, Zhu emphasized that although the market economy may provide people with equal entrepreneurship and employment opportunities, the initial conditions for individuals to enter the market are different. Therefore, the government needs to adopt redistribution and public service projects to alleviate its adverse effects. \\"Economic analysis of gender inequality\\" In 1995, Zhu attended the fourth world conference on women as a member of the Chinese government delegation. Since then, the gender perspective has been introduced into most of her research projects, among which the paper under the topic about gender equality in agricultural land distribution has won the second prize of the fifth excellent scientific research achievement of the Chinese Academy of social sciences. The article shows that the existing discrimination against women in rural society makes the policy of equal distribution of land resulting in gender inequality. In 2010, Zhu published the research report about survey on the health problems of women farmers and herdsmen in Qinghai- Gansu and Yunnan-Tibet areas in the 10th journal article of world management. In her research, she found that the disease threat faced by Tibetan women farmers was mostly related to poverty. However, health services, especially women's health services, are the weak links in the development of Tibetan areas and the implementation of the poverty alleviation plan. Sick farming and animal husbandry housewives not only have difficulty in providing good nutrition and health care for the whole family, but also tend to deepen the poverty level of the family due to their own disease burden, and easily cause stunted children, thus leading to the intergenerational transmission of poverty. Therefore, the government needs to take interventions to solve this problem. The innovation of some primary health care systems in Tibetan areas in Yunnan and Gansu province can provide valuable experience for policy improvement in other Tibetan areas. \\"Poverty reduction policy research\\" Based on the understanding of living conditions of poor groups coming from her studies about income distribution, Zhu has been exploring effective ways to alleviate and eliminate poverty since 1990. Firstly, an interdisciplinary study of economics, sociology, and nutrition is conducted on the poverty reduction effect of the “work relief” project. Using the statistical methods such as decision analysis model and Gini coefficient decomposition, the ideal method of balance diet developed by nutritionists was introduced to analyze the sample data of villages and farmers, and to see the impact of policy intervention on farmers' food security, income and financial status. Based on this, it analyzes the relationship between macroeconomic reform and the implementation of poverty reduction plans, and summarizes the current gains and losses of poverty alleviation policies. Zhu's research report “The Impact of Public Works on Economic Growth, Employment and Social Services in Rural Poverty Areas” (published in Chinese) has won the first Distinguished Scientific Research Achievement Award of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in 1993; her joint monograph with the Ministry of Agriculture's, \\"Yigongdaizhen and poverty reduction\\" was awarded the 7th Sun Yefang Economic Science Award in 1996. The English version of this book was published in the UK's Development Policy Review, No. 4, 1995. Secondly, Zhu examines the operational mechanism of poverty-alleviation-loans, and draws on international experience and the effective informal system in rural China to propose improvement measures. Her research report was serialized in Journal of Financial Research, No. 6 and 7 of 1995; Her English papers written with colleagues from the Ministry of Agriculture and Kiel (fellow student in Germany), were being discussed in 1997 at the annual meeting of the International Society of Agricultural Economics and at the poverty-reduction- policy seminar of Asian and African countries; the monograph \\"Credit System for the Rural Poor in China\\" was published by the US Nova Science Publishers Company in 1997. \\"Pension plan for rural residents and peasant-workers\\" During the period of 2007-2010, Zhu led the research team to first conduct a sample survey on the current situation of peasant workers participating in endowment insurance. Secondly, she followed up on the progress of the pilot project of the new rural residents' social endowment insurance. Besides, she was being assigned to lead the research on the construction of social security system planning project for \\"Twelfth Five-Year Plan\\". Based on the research on the construction of the social security system in the \\"Twelfth Five-Year Plan\\", Zhu has written in the Chinese Journal of Population Science (2010) that the fragmentation of China's existing social security system makes the whole system unfair and loss of efficiency. Public sector workers, especially civil servants (civil service workers), are “overprotected”, and non-public sector workers, especially farmers and rural migrant workers, are “insufficiently protected”. The implementation of the new rural cooperative medical system, the new rural insurance and the participation of peasant workers in social insurance, which is previously for urban workers, will help promote social security. In order to convey the findings and information to decision-making officials and the public, Zhu has attended the Central Office during the period of 2009-2010, the 21st Century Forum organized by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the seminar organized by the Ministry of Social Security, and the China Social Science Forum to give lectures or make speeches. In addition, she has submitted policy reports to decision-making government officials. Finally, the research report on the promotion methods of the “new rural insurance” and the sustainability of the system were approved by the central government.

It is the only member of the subfamily Astrobatrachinae and is represented by a single species, Astrobatrachus kurichiyana, commonly known as the starry dwarf frog. It was discovered in the shola cloud forests of the Wayanad Plateau, and is considered a relict species due to its very small range restricted to certain refugia habitats. It is genetically highly different from both Nyctibatrachus and Lankanectes, with their last common sister species hypothesized to have existed several millions of years ago. It can physically be distinguished by its brown coloration with an orange belly and bluish-white spots. This species is threatened by its very small distribution which completely falls outside protected areas, making it vulnerable to habitat degradation.

Built in 1956, it was the home of African-American civil rights activist Medgar Evers (1925-1963) at the time of his assassination. Now owned by Tougaloo College, the restored house is open for tours by appointment. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2017. The John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, signed March 12, 2019, authorized it as a national monument, pending acquisition of property by the National Park Service. Description and history The Medgar Evers House stands in northern Jackson, in what is called the Elraine Subdivision. This area was developed as the first planned middle-class subdivision for African- Americans in Mississippi after World War II. The house is on the north side of Margaret Walker Alexander Drive, a few doors east of its junction with Missouri Street. It is one of 36 similar single-story ranch-style houses built by Leroy Burnett and Walter J. Thompson. It is a single-story wood frame structure, set on a foundation of brick piers. It has a broad shallow-pitch gabled roof, with a built-up covering of gravel. The roof has extended eaves with the rafters exposed. To the left side, the roof extends across a carport which is accessed via the original concrete driveway; the main entrance is under the carport shelter. Part of the facade is faced in brick veneer, while the rest is finished in asbestos siding. Interior features include a bullet hole in the wall separating the kitchen and living room. The house was purchased new by Medgar and Myrlie Evers in 1956, and remained their home until 1963. The Everses were both active civil rights activists, and had for some time been specific targets of racist violence. They chose this house in part for features that improved its security: it was not on a corner lot, and its entrance under the carport provided better cover than a front door would. On May 28, 1963, a Molotov cocktail was thrown onto the carport. On June 11, 1963, Evers attended a meeting of civil rights groups in Jackson to formulate a response to actions taken by George Wallace, then Governor of Alabama, to prevent African-Americans from enrolling at the University of Alabama. Arriving home around midnight, Evers, standing in the carport, was shot by Byron de la Beckwith, using a sniper rifle from an undeveloped lot about away. The bullet passed through the house's picture window, and through the wall between the living room and kitchen before coming to rest. Evers died early the next morning. Myrlie Evers moved to California in 1964, continuing the civil rights crusade. She maintained ownership of the house for thirty years, using it as a rental property. She donated the property to Tougaloo College in 1993. The house underwent repairs and stabilization in 1995-96, and was restored to its appearance during the Evers residency in 2013.

It was declared to be a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1993 and authorized as a national monument in 2019. After acquisition of property by the National Park Service it was established as a unit on September 22, 2020. Several separated areas related to the battle have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the Confederate Mass Grave Monument in Somerset, Gen. Felix K. Zollicoffer Monument, and the Mill Springs National Cemetery. Area The initial designated area for the National Register of Historic Places included three separate areas: the battlefield, and two separate areas with Confederate fortifications on each side of Lake Cumberland (one near Mill Springs, and the other by Beech Grove). The three separate areas amounted to of land, most of which is in Pulaski County, Kentucky (the battlefield), with the rest in Wayne County, Kentucky.Brent p. 4 The main difference in the land from 1862 to the modern day is that the landscape is less wooded. Also the name of the town during the battle was Logan's Crossing, when today it is called Nancy. There are no buildings left that were standing during the war, although none of the modern buildings seriously detracted from the area's National Register status. Two of the 29 noncontributing structures on the battlefield during the nomination were later placed on the National Register; both were monuments placed on the battlefield in 1910.Brent p. 6 Visitor Center and Museum Ceremony at the Zollicoffer Monument The Mill Springs Battlefield Visitors Center and Museum commemorates the January 1862 Battle of Mill Springs, fought during the early days of the American Civil War. The museum is located in Nancy, Kentucky, just past the northern edge of the battlefield, overlooking where Union forces camped. It is adjacent to the Mill Springs National Cemetery, which contains the Federal interments (the Confederate burials are at Zollicoffer Park, a short distance away, on the battlefield proper). The museum was formally dedicated on November 4, 2006. Operated by the Mill Springs Battlefield Association, the museum consists of a central foyer where greeters welcome guests and direct them to the various parts of the museum, which consists of a community room, library, legacy room, and exhibition hall, as well as a gift shop. There is also a high-security space for traveling exhibits. The Brown- Lanier House, used as a headquarters during the battle, is also owned by the Battlefield Association. It is maintained as a bed and breakfast. On January 15, 2013, Kentucky Representative Hal Rogers introduced the bill H.R. 298, officially titled \\"To direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study to evaluate the significance of the Mill Springs Battlefield located in Pulaski and Wayne Counties, Kentucky, and the feasibility of its inclusion in the National Park System, and for other purposes,\\" into the United States Congress. The bill would direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study to evaluate the significance of the Mill Springs Battlefield in Kentucky (relating to the Battle of Mill Springs fought on January 19, 1862, in Pulaski and Wayne Counties during the Civil War) and the feasibility of its inclusion in the National Park System (NPS). Rogers said that \\"the Battle of Mill Springs is a source of great pride and interest to the people I serve.\\" Rogers argued that the battlefield was a \\"jewel\\" and would be \\"an excellent addition to the National Park Service.\\" The John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, signed into law March 12, 2019, authorized it as a national monument, established upon acquisition of property by the National Park Service. Zollicoffer Park Zollicoffer Park features two separate monuments that are on the National Register of Historic Places. These are the General Felix K. Zollicoffer Monument just inside the park, and the Confederate Mass Grave Monument in Somerset which is further into the park. Both were built due to a local girl by the name of Dorotha Burton decorating a white oak tree in Confederate general Felix K. Zollicoffer's honor, who had died in the battle after failing to realize he was close to the Union lines; he thought he was close to his Confederate lines. In 1995 the tree was destroyed during a lightning storm, but a sapling from that tree was put in its place in 1997, and is also called the Zollie tree.

K-103's western terminus is at K-7 south of the City of Cherokee and the eastern terminus is at U.S. Route 69 (US-69), US-160 and US-400 south of the City of Pittsburg. Along the way the route passes through the City of Weir. K-103 was designated as a state highway by 1936, and extended from US-160 east to US-69. Then in 1958, US-160 was realigned east along K-103 from K-103's original western terminus to K-7 then continued east along K-104 to US-69, and at that time K-103 was truncated to its current western terminus. Route description K-103 begins at an at-grade intersection with K-7 south of Cherokee and begins travelling east. After roughly it crosses BNSF Railway tracks. It then passes the Hosey Hill Cemetery then reaches Weir. It travels through the city and continues east. After roughly it crosses Brush Creek, a tributary of Cow Creek and then reaches its eastern terminus at US-69, US-160 and US-400. K-103 is not included in the National Highway System. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-103 does connect to the National Highway System at its eastern terminus. 2017 Annual average daily traffic (AADT) on K-103 was 775 near the eastern terminus. The entire route is paved with partial design bituminous pavement.  History   Early roads  Before state highways were numbered in Kansas there were Auto trails, which were an informal network of marked routes that existed in the United States and Canada in the early part of the 20th century. K-103's western terminus (K-7) was part of the Jefferson Highway and Kansas City-Fort Scott-Miami-Tulsa Short Line auto trails.  Establishment and realignments  K-103 first appears as a state highway on the 1936 Cherokee County map and extended from US-160 east for to K-7 then overlapped K-7 south for then left K-7 and travelled east through Weir to end at US-69. In a September 17, 1942 meeting, it was approved to realign K-103 as a spur from Weir northward to a new alignment of US-160. But then in a September 30, 1943 resolution, that plan was cancelled due to restrictions imposed on the State Highway Commission caused by World War II. Then in 1958, US-160 was realigned east along K-103 from K-103's original western terminus to K-7 then continued east along K-104 to US-69, and at that time K-103 was truncated to its current western terminus.

She served as vice-president for the Woman's Press Department of the World's Columbian Exposition, in Chicago. Early years and education Novella Jewell Trott was born in Woolwich, Maine, November 16, 1846. She was the daughter of Alfred and Olive Turner (Farnham) Trott. She traced her ancestry back to the Puritan emigrant, Thomas Trott, who came from England to Dorchester, Massachusetts, in 1635, and to Ralph Farnham, who, in the same year, settled in Andover, Massachusetts. Benjamin Trott and Joshua Farnham, descendants of the above, both removed to Woolwich about 1750, and there founded families whose children, from generation to generation, were noted for their intelligence, integrity and public spirit. Her siblings included, Lemuel Garland, Julia Elizabeth, Fanny Farnham, Ruth Shirley, Alice Gertrude, and Alfred Everett. At the age of thirteen, when Trott had outgrown the public schools of her native town, she entered the public schools of Bath, Maine, afterward taking a special course of study in the State Normal School at Farmington (now University of Maine at Farmington). Career Early on, Trott showed an inclination towards literature, and she had intended to make teaching her profession. During a visit to Boston, she was invited to take a position as proof-reader in a prominent publishing house. There, she had her introduction to the work which she was afterwards to adopt as a profession. A sudden illness compelled her to give up her position and, upon her recovery, she resumed her original plans and taught successfully for several years. The five following years were devoted to the care of her invalid mother, after which circumstances opened the way for her return to literary life. In 1881, she began working for the publishing establishment of E. C. Allen, in Augusta, Maine, where she soon worked her way to a position upon the editorial staff. She became sole editor of the Practical Housekeeper and Daughters of America. From 1883, she performed all branches of editorial work, selecting, compiling, condensing, revising, writing from month to month editorial, critical and literary articles, reading a large number of manuscripts and conducting the extensive correspondence of her office. She was appointed one of seven women of national reputation to represent the press department of the Queen Isabella Association in the World's Columbian Exposition, in Chicago, in 1893. In the following year, she was associated with W. H. Gannett, in Augusta, Maine, as assistant editor and proofreader. She died May 29, 1929, in Woolwich, and was buried at the city's Riverside Cemetery. Her parents were buried there, too.

Khashoggi born in Medina (October 26, 1941 – May 1, 2012) was the first industrial engineer in Saudi Arabia capable of designing heavy duty industrial factories as well as being a scholar and an author. He designed and founded Saudi Steel, the first steel factory in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Steel soon became the largest factory in the Arabian world. His partners in Saudi Steel were Sheikh Omar al Saggaf, Foreign Minister and best friend; and Sheikh Kamal Adham, Head of the Saudi CIA and brother-in-law of Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (King Faisal).  Family  Sheikh Riad Khashoggi was the son of Ahmed Hamza Khashoggi and Esaaf al Dafterdar (1920-2010); Grandson of Sheikh Hamza al Khashoggi (1863–1954) who had dealings with Lawrence of Arabia; Brother of Jamal A. Khashoggi (13 October 1958 – 2 October 2018) who was murdered October 2, 2018 in Istanbul; Brother of Sahel Khashoggi, Wajdi Khashoggi, Samiha, Sanah, and Salwa Khashoggi; Cousin of Adnan Khashoggi (25 July 1935 – 6 June 2017), Adel Khashoggi, Samira Khashoggi, and attorney, Motasem Khashoggi. Adnan Khashoggi and Samira Khashoggi were brother and sister. Samira Khashoggi married Adnan Khashoggi's accountant, Mohammed Fayed; they had a son, Dodi Fayed, who was dating Diana, Princess of Wales, when the two were killed in a car crash in Paris. Riad and Jamal Khashoggi's family on their mother's side was grandmother Sitti Asia al Dafterdar, daughter of the Mufti von Medina (1874–1990), who lived to the age of 116, and General YaYa al Dafterdar, General of the Saudi Arabian Army, uncle of Riad and Jamal Khashoggi and without whom–and without Riad Khashoggi's help–there would not be Adnan Khashoggi, “the richest man in the world.” The grandfather of Riad Khashoggi, Jamal Khashoggi, Sahel, and Samiha was Sheikh Hamza Khashoggi (1863-1954). Adnan Khashoggi's father was Mohamed Khashoggi, who was Sheikh Hamza's younger brother–Riad and Jamal Khashoggi's uncle. Sheikh Hamza al Khashoggi made his brother's medical study at the Sorbonne University possible. Mohamed Khashoggi became the first professional surgeon in Saudi Arabia and later became the personal physician to King Abdul Aziz al Saud, King of Saudi Arabia. Sheikh Hamza sent his brother, Mohamed, to France to study medicine before WWII was over.  Primary and Secondary School  Riad Khashoggi graduated from High School (Medina) in 1958. At which time he received a Technical Education Scholarship from Dahran Electrical Company and studied in Germany at the University of Bremen. While attending the University of Bremen, Khashoggi had a stroke of luck and met a Moroccan in the streets who had business dealings in Germany. Thus, Riad Khashoggi had his first encounter with the business world and received an offer from the German export company “Dunselmann & Michaelsen” to work with them traveling all over the Middle East selling their goods. He soon became a young millionaire. However, at the persuasion of his cousin, Adnan Khashoggi, Riad Khashoggi returned to Saudi Arabia to join the family's gypsum factory business.  Career  Riad Khashoggi returned to Saudi Arabia (1967) and became a partner in the family gypsum business, which was near bankruptcy. Riad Khashoggi left the family business (1970) and started the operation of Saudi Steel. He was the only industrial engineer in Saudi Arabia who was capable of designing such a heavy duty factory. His partners were Kamal Adham, head of the Saudi Arabian CIA Secret Service and brother in law of Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (King Faisal), Sheikh Omar al Saggaf, Minister of Interior, and others. King Faisal supported this project with land and a check for $12 million. Within a short time, Saudi Steel became the largest steel factory in the Arabian world, competitive with the international steel industry. Soon after Riad Khashoggi entered into a joint venture with the German steel factory Krupp which became known as RAK-Krupp (with RAK meaning Riad Ahmed Khashoggi). Simultaneously, he established RAK Trading, Mechanical, and Electrical Corporation (later known as RAK). In 1975, due to serious political problems as well as King Faisal's and Omar al Saggaf's death (assassination), Riad had no choice but to sell his shares of the company, Saudi Steel. And he focused on expanding his companies “RAK Trading, Mechanical and Electrical Corporation” (RAK). RAK grew into a strong organization; it executed multi-million dollar projects in steel construction, high-capacity fuel tanks, high-rise buildings, steel barges for Jeddah harbor, sub-contracting for Airport Jeddah, highways, and special heavy technical projects. Joint ventures included the American companies, John Mansfield (USA) and Krupp Steel (Germany). RAK became one of the leading companies in Saudi Arabia (1980) which included RAK-KRUPP Steel Division; RAK STEEL Construction; RAK Contracting; RAK Trade Division; and RAK International (the first environmental factory in Greece that introduced and used recycled material for packaging fruit).  Personal life  Riad Khashoggi married Angelika Berlanda. They had three children: Deenah, Nadia, and Raed. They divorced in 1984. In 1986, Riad Khashoggi married his second wife, Eleonora de Lennart.

K-101 passes through mostly rural farmlands except where it passes through Edna. When K-101 was first designated in 1937, it was a spur linking US-166 to Edna. Then in 1954, it was extended to its current northern terminus, which at the time was K-96. In 1998, the northern terminus became US-160 when K-96 was truncated to end in Wichita. Route description K-101 begins at an intersection with US-166 just south of Edna. South of the intersection of US-166, the roadway continues as locally maintained Rural Secondary 369 (RS-369). From US-166, K-101 heads north through Edna and then reaches the Edna Cemetery. Roughly past Edna Cemetery, it crosses Hackberry Creek, then continues another roughly , where it reaches an intersection with RS-378. K-101 continues northward from here for another roughly , and crosses Pumpkin Creek, a tributary of Pumpkin Creek.

Biography  Harcourt was the youngest son of Jean III de Harcourt, Viscount of Châtellerault and Saint-Sauveur and Alix de Brabant. Geoofrey was known as \\"the lame\\" due to him having a deformed leg, which made him limp. He was knighted in 1326 and inherited the Viscounty of Saint-Sauveur in 1330. In 1339, along with his older brother John IV of Harcourt, he became one of the 50 main Norman barons who pledged to help the King Philip VI of France in a future invasion of England. This attempt came to an end in 1340 with the annihilation of the French fleet during the Battle of Sluys, at the end of the Flanders campaign to which Geoffroy de Harcourt participated with 6 knights and 30 squiresLéopold Delisle, Histoire du château et des sires de Saint- Sauveur-le-Vicomte, p.51..

Philip VI gave the hand of the heiress to Guillaume, with Geoffroy aggrieved by this rebuttal and began around 1343, a private war against the Tancarville family. The king then intervened severely against Harcourt by ordering the seizure of his property and beheaded Geoffroy's loyal supporters; Jean Tesson of de la Roche Tesson, Guillaume Bacon of Blay and Richard III de Percy of Soulles, Sienne and Juaye in April 1344. They had been accused of having participated in a plot to place Harcourt at the head of the Duchy of Normandy by a secret alliance with King Edward III of EnglandLéopold Delisle, Histoire du château et des sires de Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte, p.53.. Forced into exile, Harcourt retired to his lands in Flanders where he was greeted by his cousin, Duke John III of Brabant. Capture of Caen by Edward III of England and Geoffroy de Harcourt. Hoping to regain his Norman strongholds, Harcourt travelled to England where he placed himself in the service of Edward III, whom he paid homage as the King of France. By letters patent given at Westminster, Edward III promised to procure for him in England some lands, in compensation for those which he had left in Brabant, and to put him in possession of his Norman strongholdsLéopold Delisle, Histoire du château et des sires de Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte, p.60.. Edward III made him commander, along with Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick, of one of the three army groups which landed at Saint-Vaast La Hougue on 12 July 1346. Harcourt led Edward III's army through Normandy, capturing Saint-Sauveur, the castle of Jeanne Bacon and took part in the capture of Caen. He convinced the Edward III to put an end to the massacre of the population. He was in the English kings guard during the English victory at the Battle of Crécy. His elder brother Count John IV of Harcourt, governor of Rouen, died while fighting on the French side. Recognising the body of his brother killed in the French ranks, after the battle, he was beset with remorse and afterwards began negotiations with Philip VI, to return to the side of the French. Arrest of the King of Navarre and Count Harcourt at the banquet of Rouen. Geoffroy obtained a pardon from Philip VI, who probably had no other choice due be being weakened by defeat. From 1347, Harcourt is captain-ruler of Rouen and Caen, with permission to levy taxes and troops. Noting this change of allegiance, Edward III confiscates his property in England.

From 2001 to 2006, Redish served as the Head of Department of Economics at the University of British Columbia and was awarded The President's Medal of Excellence by the University of British Columbia in 2018 for her contributions towards establishing the Vancouver School of Economics.  Education and work  Redish was born in United Kingdom and moved to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada with her family during her teen years. She graduated from Wilfrid Laurier University having earned a B.A. in economics. Following this, she took a two-year break to work at Cuso International as a volunteer in Papua New Guinea. Upon returning to Canada, she received a Ph.D. from the University of Western Ontario. Shortly after, she joined the University of British Columbia as an assistant professor of economics at the Vancouver School of Economics. She went on to work as a senior adviser to then UBC Vancouver President Stephen Toope, acting as a faculty liaison and providing advice on the university budget and government relations. From 2012 to 2015, Redish was Vice Provost and then Associate Vice-President. From 2015 to July 2017 she served as a Provost and Vice President Academic pro tem. Redish is best known for her research regarding the history of monetary and banking systems within Europe and North America. Her research interests include central bank, monetary economics, financial system, macroeconomics and capital market. In most research papers, Redish frequently collaborates with Michael D. Bordo, a Canadian economist and professor of economics at Rutgers University. She has multiple published articles in journals such as The Economic History Review, Canadian Journal of Economics, The Journal of Economic History and the European Economic Review. According to IDEAS/RePEc, Redish has been ranked in the top 5% of number of distinct works weighted by recursive impact factor and number of authors.  Research   \\"Why didn't Canada have a banking crisis in 2008 (or in 1930, or 1907)? (2015)  A major area of Redish's research revolves around the financial system and monetary economics. Together with Hugh Rockoff, a professor of economics at Rutgers University, and Michael D. Bordo, Redish analyzes Canada's position as an outlier in the 2008 financial crisis that engulfed the entirety of the US banking system as well as many other significant European countries. Redish along with Bordo and Rockoff strongly argue that the structure of financial systems is path-dependent and the source of the relative stability within the Canadian banks in the recent financial crisis came from Canada's distinct financial structure which involved innate Canadian conservatism and superior Canadian regulation. Unlike the United States, Canada's Federal government was given the power to charter and regulate banks. In the United States, the Constitution did not unambiguously give the Federal government power over banking. Upon examining her findings, Redish concludes that in the US unregulated or lightly regulated sectors of the financial system (shadow banking system) proved to be the source of majority of their trouble. Despite reforms, the fundamental structural weaknesses of the U.S. financial system, a fragmented banking system, regulated by a patchwork of regulatory agencies, it survived unharmed. Redish argues that the growth of the shadow banking system along with an ideological turn toward lesser regulated markets and political clout of regulated industries achieved through lobbying and campaign contributions were the prominent causes of the various failures of the US banking system. The consequence was that the systemic risk that led to the financial crisis of 2007 - 2008. However, the Canadian concentrated banking system that had evolved by the end of the twentieth century had absorbed the key sources of systemic risk—the mortgage market and investment banking—and was tightly regulated by one overarching regulator.  \\"The evolution of financial inter-mediation: Evidence from 19th-century Ontario micro-data\\" (2015)  Redish co-authors this paper with Livio Di Matteo, an economist and professor of economics at Lakehead University. Redish and Di Matteo analyze the micro-data of Ontario descendants in terms of an individual's asset holdings in the 19th century to illustrate the substantial growth of the early Canadian banking system and evolving nature of monetary liabilities. Upon gathering data from inventories of 7,516 probated estate files of Ontario decedents in the years 1802 and 1902, Redish examines the impact of these determinants of an individual's asset monetary holdings as well as the role of demographic, geographic and economic factors in the growth of the banking system. From 1871 to 1913 the banking sector grew relative to the size of the Canadian economy, specifically Ontario, Canada's largest province, in the 1890s accounted for the greatest economic output. The nature of bank liabilities changed dramatically: in 1871, 32% of the monetary liabilities of the Canadian banks were notes in circulation, while by 1913 that ratio had fallen to 9.5%. The data collected from the late 19th century allowed Redish and Di Matteo to link the individuals to census data and study the trends at a macroeconomic level. Analyzing the micro-data with Di Matteo, Redish finds that the expansion of deposit banking happened at a macroeconomic level rather than a micro-economic level, and this was correlated with the expansion of the branch network of the banking system. Upon further exploring the data Redish and Di Matteo believe wealth and urbanization are crucial factors in explaining the growth of deposit banking, however, the significance of a dummy variable for 1902 points to other time-correlated factors such as innovations in transportation and new advancements in financial technology that lowered costs and facilitated access to banking services.  \\"Central Banks: Past, Present, Future\\" (2012)  This paper is co-written by Redish and Olga Marcela Namen Leon, a faculty member of the department of economics at the Del Rosario University. This research delves into one of Redish's key area of interest regarding the financial system, it provides an insight into the authorization and formation of central banks in a historical context with the goal of understanding the rationale behind the European Central Bank. During the twentieth century, central banks constantly transformed each decade to play four crucial roles in an economy: fiscal support, financial stability support, monetary support and micro-economic support. Redish and Leon provide examples from the past regarding each of the aforementioned roles such as: in western economies the macroeconomic motive dominated after World War II; during the last two decades of the 20th century the monetary stability goal dominated. Upon analyzing the evolution of established banks in the 20th century, Redish and Leon observe that the fiscal role of central banks dominated in the early days of central banking. In the early 21st century, the nature of money changed and the financial stability role dominated. The deviation from macroeconomic stability and fiscal contributions of central banks, along with a belief that the ‘market’ would support illiquid but solvent financial institutions created an environment where central bank independence took pride of place. Redish believes this encouraged the creation of a central bank that was not tied to a particular sovereign and had greater independence than any central bank to date —the European Central Bank. Redish and Leon stress that the mandates of central banks have evolved in response to three factors: the existence of alternative sources of funds for the sovereign, the prevailing economic theory or broader set of philosophical beliefs, and the technology of money.  \\"Deflation, Productivity Shocks and Gold: Evidence from the 1880–1914 Period\\" (2010)  In this paper, Redish along with Michael D. Bordo and John Landon-Lane, a professor of economics at Rutgers University, explore the time period between 1880 and 1914 which was characterized by secular deflation and the possibility of a similar deflationary situation occurring in the early 21st century between 2000 and 2004. Redish examines this possible circumstance with a historical perspective and she largely focuses on the experience of deflation in the late 19th century when most of the countries in the world adhered to the classical gold standard versus 2005's monetary environment. Redish states that there were salient factors that illustrated the economic environment before 1914 being similar to today's environment (early 21st century). Firstly, the level of deflation, indicated by the GNP deflator, before 1914 in U.S. declined at an average rate of 1% - 1.5% per year from 1880 to 1896. Secondly, technological advancement and productivity grew at a significant rate due to the emergence of iron and steel industries particularly in Germany and US. Third, the price level at the time was anchored by a credible nominal anchor—adherence to gold convertibility. In today's environment, many believe the price level has anchored to inflationary expectations in a similar way. Lastly, the late 19th century was an era of globalization - similar to the conditions today. Additionally, Bordo, Landon-Lane and Redish distinguish between good and bad deflation. They assert that good deflation occurs when it is caused due to a supply shock while bad deflation occurs when it is due to a demand shock. The paper focuses on the price level, by following the gold standard, as a form of growth within four countries within the time period 1880 to 1914: United States, United Kingdom, France and Germany. Redish and her co-authors note that towards the end of the 20th century inflation rates were extremely low while some countries experienced deflation, despite this the output growth rates remained positive. Not since the turn of the 19th century has economies experienced such low inflation associated with non-negative growth. Their results from the research showed that the deflation in the gold standard era within all the four countries reflected both positive aggregate supply and negative money supply shocks. Yet the negative money shock had only a minor effect on output. Redish believes the reason behind this was the aggregate supply curve which was very steep in the short run. The authors conclude that the gathered evidence suggests that deflation in the late 19th century was primarily good, similar to the situation at the end of the 20th century. Redish also highlights some key differences between the two time periods that have been compared. Between 1880 and 1914, the four countries that followed the classical gold standard regime, under which linked them together through common adherence to the gold standard convertibility rule, had all faced a common money shock – the vagaries of the gold standard unlike the end of the 20th century. They emphasize the zero nominal bound problem made it difficult to conduct monetary policy by conventional means which was not an issue during the late 19th century.

Some of the structures of historical significance are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Other structures, which are located on the historic Route 66 are eligible to be listed in National Register of Historic Places in accordance to the \\"Route 66 in Arizona Survey Report\\". Holbrook was founded in 1881, and incorporated in 1917. Brief history The first known inhabitants of the Holbrook area were the Pre-Columbian Puebloans and Anasazi. The Agate House built by the Puebloans, made out of petrified wood in the Petrified Forest, serves as evidence that they inhabited that area approximately from the year 900 to 1200 AD. The Anasazi pueblo village compound in the forest was inhabited from 1250 to 1350 AD. It contains over 100 rooms and kivas. The area was later inhbited by the Hopi, Navajos and Apaches. The Navajos and Apaches often fought each other and against the Puebloans. The first Europeans to arrive in the area were the Spanish conquistadores. Captain Don Garcia de Cardenas and his party arrived in Arizona, which at the time was part of \\"New Mexico\\", in 1540. Francisco Vázquez de Coronado searched for the Seven Cities of Cibola and camped some sixty miles east of what was to become Holbrook. Coronado sent an expedition west to find the Colorado River, and they crossed the Little Colorado River some twenty-five miles east of the future Holbrook site and found a colorful area which they named \\"El Desierto Pintada\\" (The Painted Desert). The expedition was then led by the Hopis to the Grand Canyon. The area became part of Mexico when Mexico gained its independence from Spain. United States Territory Wagon Road Marker The United States fought against Mexico in what is known as the Mexican–American War. The war ended officially when the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed and forced onto the remnant Mexican government. It specified its major consequence, the Mexican Cession of the northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo México to the United States.Robarts, \\"Mexican War veterans\\" pp.1–24 From 1851 to 1857 the U.S. Army sent three expeditions along the 35th parallel. the company led by Lt.Edward Fitzgerald Beale built a ten foot wide wagon road known as Beale's Wagon Road. The area was known as Navajo Springs, after a spring a dozen miles northeast of Holbrook. Soon afterwards a store and saloon were established at the confluence of the Rio Puerco and Little Colorado Rivers two miles east of what was to become Holbrook, and the area became known as the Horsehead Crossing. The wagon road that Lt. Beale built became a popular immigrant trail during the 1860s and 1870s, and it was this survey which marked out for the first time a practicable highway along the 35th parallel that has been used from that day on.Gerald Thompson, Edward F. Beale and the American West, University of New Mexico Press, 1983.Southwest Explorations, The Beale Wagon Road Among the migrants who moved westward through Beale's Wagon Road were members of the Mormon religion who in 1876 founded Joseph City. The Atlantic and Pacific railroad began their expansion westward under the supervision of Henry Randolph Holbrook, the railroad chief engineer. The railroad workers set up a camp a mile from Joseph City (at the time the city was called St. Joseph City). Later, they established a temporary railroad station at Horsehead Crossing in present-day Holbrook. John W. Young, a grading contractor, named the station \\"Holbrook\\" in honor of the A & P chief engineer. The name stuck and in September 24, 1881, after the railroad reached Holbrook Station, the town of Holbrook was founded. Lawlessness Some members of the Hashknife OutfitBucket of Blood StreetSheriff Commodore Perry OwensHashknife Brand The town became a booming cow-town after the Aztec Land and Cattle Company was established in 1884. The Aztec soon became known as the Hashknife Outfit because their brand resembled the knife used by range-land “chuckwagon” cooks. The company hired cowboys of ill repute who often rode into the main commercial district branding and firing their guns. Terrill's Cottage Saloon was a popular cowboy gathering place. According to local lore a gunfight took place in 1891 where two men were murdered. There was so much blood spilled on the floors that it looked like a \\"bucket of blood\\" and hence the saloon was renamed the Bucket of Blood Saloon. Twenty-six men were killed in what also became known as the Bucket of Blood Street. Apache Chief Geronimo had been at war with the United States for some time, before surrendering in 1886. On September 13, 1886, some of his people were escorted by the US Cavalry to the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Depot in Holbrook from Fort Apache and placed on a train which took them to Fort Marion in Florida where they were imprisoned.\\"The Apache Wars: The Hunt for Geronimo, the Apache Kid, and the Captive Boy Who Started the Longest War in American History\\"; By: Paul Andrew Hutton; Chapter: \\"The Wind and The Darkness; page:387; Publisher: Crown/Archetype, 2016; , 9780770435820 Navajo County was split from Apache County on March 21, 1895. There had been a rivalry between the towns of Winslow and Holbrook as to who was to have the County Seat of Navajo. Holbrook received the majority of the votes. The first county sheriff was Commodore Perry Owens, a gunman who had previously served as the sheriff of Apache County. The county was the location of many of the events which occurred during the Pleasant Valley War. Andy Blevins, a member of the Hashknife Outfit who was wanted in Texas, bragged about killing two men in the Pleasant Valley War. On September 4, 1887, Sheriff Commodore Perry Owens decided to serve Belvins with an arrest warrant. The sheriff went alone to the Belvins house and a shoot out known as the \\"Holbrook Shout-Out\\" ensued. Sheriff Owens was fired upon by the occupants of the Blevins house and, in the space of a few seconds, he killed Andy, his brother Sam and Mose Roberts. The town gained a reputation as being \\"Too Tough For Women or Churches\\". Holbrook was said to be the only county seat in the U.S. that didn't have a church. Dr. Sidney Sapp, was the Judge of the Superior Court of Navajo County. He was also, the founder of the \\"Holbrook News\\". Judge Sapp was married to Alma Sapp who protested that she will not live in a town without a church. Judge Sapp decided to collect enough funds to establish a church. The Community Church building was finally built in 1912. Holbrook was affected by two large fires, one in 1888 and another in 1902. Both fires destroyed many of the businesses which were established in the area. Holbrook was also affected by many floods which were harder to control. Holbrook is incorporated On March 6, 1917, the City of Holbrook, which is now known as the \\"Gateway to the Petrified Forest\\", was finally incorporated. The first appointed city mayor was W. R. Scorse and the first person who was elected as mayor on May 28, 1917, was George W. Hennesey. The historic Route 66, which runs through Holbrook, was completed in 1926.Paradis, pp. 96–97.Thomas W. Paradis, \\"From Downtown to Theme Town: Reinventing America's Smaller Historic Retail Districts\\", pp. 57–74 in The Themed Space: Locating Culture, Nation, and Self, ed. Scott A. Lukas (Lanham, Maryland, Lexington Books, 2007), The establishment of Route 66 was one of the major factors which contributed to the growth of the City. People who emigrated to the western part of the United States and tourists from different parts of the country often stopped and visited the city. As a consequence many motels were built, among them the Wigwam Motel also known as the \\"Wigwam Village #6\\", located at 811 West Hopi Drive. Some of the structures in Holbrook are listed in the National Register of Historic places. There are other structures, which according to the \\"Route 66 in Arizona Survey Report\\" are eligible to be listed in National Register of Historic Places. The fact that a property is listed in the National Register of Historic Places or that it may be eligible to be listed as such, does not mean that the property is safe from being demolished by its owner. According to Jim McPherson, Arizona Preservation Foundation Board President: The Navajo County Historical Society, which is in charge of show casing the legacy given to Holbrook and neighboring areas from its early residents, is located in the historic Navajo County Courthouse. The museum, which is also an official Arizona Visitors Center, has a collection of items related to the history of Holbrook on exhibit. The society's mission is to \\"collect, preserve and disseminate as a public trust, the heritage of the citizens of Navajo County\\".

The route evolved from several pathfinding expeditions. Lt. Amiel W Whipple's 1853–54 railroad survey; Lt. Edward F Beale's 1857 military experiment using camels for transport; and the Wagon Road constructed by Beale in 1858–59. Lt. Col. Jose Franvez escorted Arizona's first territorial Governor, John Noble Goodwin, over this trail in 1864 to establish a capitol in the Prescott vicinity. In 1876 Mormon immigrants from Utah entered the Little Colorado Valley along this road.\\" *The Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Depot was built in 1883 is located at Purple Heart Trail (U.S. Route 180) and E. Bucket of Blood Street. It was in this depot that some of Apaches were brought from Fort Apache in 1886, where they boarded a train for Florida after their leader Geronimo surrendered. *The Santa Fe Train concrete Depot extension of the historic station was built in 1907. *The Arizona Rancho was built in 1881 and is located at the Jct. of Tovar and Apache Streets. The Arizona Rancho, also known as the Higgins House, Brunswick Hotel and Arizona Hotel, is a former hotel. It was originally built between 1881 and 1883 as a residence, the expanded as a boarding house, a hotel, and finally as a motel. The original structure is thought to be the oldest extant structure in Holbrook. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on October 17, 1997, ref.: #97001210. *The A & B Schuster Mercantile Company a quarried stone warehouse to the east of the Holbrook Railroad station.

The crossing was the forerunner of Holbrook. *The Navajo County Sheriff office also known as the \\"Home of the Hashknife gang posse\\". The structure was built in 1882 and is located on 205 Joy Nevin Ave. The Aztec Land and Cattle Company was created in 1884. The company employed cowboys and many of them were criminal fugitives from other states. They became known as the Hashknife Outfit because their brand resembled the knife used by rangeland “chuckwagon” cooks. The many cowboys hired by the company delighted in racing into town, yelling and brandishing their six-guns, and often shooting out any lights they saw. Because of their activities, Holbrook became known as the toughest and most lawless town in the west. Within the period of one year, twenty-six shooting victims succumbed. In 1957, Sheriff Ben Pearson had his office in this building. He formed the Sheriff's Hash Knife Posse.Navajo Sheriff's Documents * The Navajo County Courthouse was built in 1898 and is located at 100 Arizona Street. The first major trial held in the courtroom was that of George Smiley, who was accused of murder. Smiley was found guilty. His was the only hanging carried out from a scaffold at the courthouse. The courthouse now houses the Navajo County Historical Society and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 31, 1978, ref.: #78000556. *The Blevins House was built in 1885 and is located at Joy Nevin Ave. and Second Street. This where on September 4, 1887, Sheriff Commodore Perry Owens confronted Andy Belvins, a member of the Hashknife Gang who was wanted for murder. The Holbrook Shoot-out resulted in the deaths of three members of the Belvins clan. It was in this historic landmark that Bruce Babbitt chose to be sworn in there as Arizona attorney general in 1975. Babbitt, who went on to be Arizona governor and U.S. Secretary of Interior, was asked back then if he identified with Sheriff Owens. Babbitt's dead pan response was: \\"I'm not a gunfighter.\\" *The Holbrook Cemetery was established in 1881.
