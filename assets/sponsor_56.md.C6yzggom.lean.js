Biography  Sachs was the son of a Jewish family of jewelers. He was educated in an English-style boarding- school, lived for a year in London and worked in a bookshop, and returned to Paris. . In 1925 he converted to Catholicism and decided to become a priest, though this didn't last upon meeting a young man on the beach at Juan-les- Pins. After involvement in a number of dubious business activities, he traveled to New York City, where he passed himself off as an art dealer. Returning to Paris, he associated himself with leading homosexual writers of the time - Cocteau, Gide, and Max Jacob - with all of whom he had stormy relationships whose precise nature is unclear. At various times he worked for Jean Cocteau and Coco Chanel, in both cases stealing from them. He associated with Violette Leduc who describes her friendship with him in her autobiography La B√¢tarde. She describes the writing, and her reading of the first version of Le Sabbat in La Batarde (pages 380-400) and how she tried to get him, unsuccessfully, to remove harsh references to Jean Cocteau. Sachs was mobilized at the start of World War II, but was discharged for homosexuality. During the early years of the Occupation, he made money out of helping Jewish families escape to the Unoccupied Zone. He may also have been an informer for the Gestapo. He was later imprisoned in Fuhlsb√ºttel.  Death  In 1945, before the advance of British troops, the prison of Fuhlsb√ºttel was evacuated and its inmates moved to the city of Kiel. The evacuation consisted of a long march that took many days to complete. On the third day of the journey, April 14, 1945, at 11:00 in the morning, Sachs became too exhausted to continue the march. He was killed by a bullet through his neck, and his body was abandoned at the side of the road with the body of another \\"companion of the same misfortune.\\" Said Emmanuel Pollaud-Dulian about Sachs, \\"He does not show much compassion for the Jewish people, and deplores their resignation, which seems to be the dominant feature of their character. On the countryside, when passing a herd of sheep, he sighs sadly saying, 'the Jews...' The drama he plays does not escape him. But, trapped in his state of amorality, Sachs does not believe in the existence of innocent victims.\\" Works * Alias, 1935.

The Music of Emilia-Romagna has the reputation of being one of the richest in Europe; there are six music conservatories alone in the region, and the sheer number of other musical venues and activities is astounding. The region, as the name implies, combines the traditions of two different, contiguous areas--Emilia and Romagna--and it is perhaps this blend that contributes to the wealth of musical culture. Musical venues and activities * Bologna's Teatro Comunale is located in Piazza Verdi, in the historic centre of the city, near the International museum and library of music and the Giovanni Battista Martini Music Conservatory. The theatre has a permanent orchestra and the city sponsors an annual MusicaInsieme (Music Together) chamber music festival as well as a series of university concerts. Other venues in the city include the Manzoni Auditorium, the Mario Caglio Europauditorium, the premises of the Philharmonic Academy, the musical instrument collection of the Music Museum, the Chapel of San Petronio, and the University Department of Music and Theatre. * Cesena is the site of the Teatro Alessandro Bonci and the Bruno Maderna music conservatory. Musical activities in the province include sunrise concerts during the summer and the Suoni del Tempo (Sounds of Time) Festival in the Rocca Malatestiana fortress. * Ferrara's Teatro Comunale was built in 1798. It is the centre of activity for the annual Ferrara Music Festival. The city has a permanent symphonic orchestra and the Association Ferrara Musica as well as the Gustav Mahler Academy, an organization that runs master classes for young musicians. * Forl√¨ is the site of the new Teatro Diego Fabbri. * Modena, the city of Luciano Pavarotti, has a reputation as a centre of Italian pop music, the city of agents, recording studios, publishers, etc. The Teatro Comunale is from 1841. The city has an important musical manuscript collection in the Estense Library and sponsors an annual International Festival of Military Bands. * Parma's Teatro Regio di Parma is historic, having been built in 1829, when the territory was still the Duchy of Parma. Recent additions to the musical infrastructure of the city include the Casa della Musica to house the musical archives of the city, the Niccol√≤ Paganini Auditorium, and the Toscanini Orchestra, a permanent ensemble. There is an annual Verdi Festival and a joint festival with the neighbouring province of Reggio. Parma is also the site of one of the true marvels of Italian theatre, the Teatro Farnese from 1628, still an active musical venue. Finally, Parma is the birthplace of Arturo Toscanini and the site of the Arrigo Boito music conservatory. * Piacenza's Teatro Municipale was built in 1798. The town is the site of the Giuseppe Nicolini Conservatory and in Villanova sull'Arda stands the Giuseppe Verdi hospital, donated by the composer to his native province just three miles from the town of Busseto, his birthplace. * Ravenna hosts the Ravenna Festival annually in the region, plus a concert series of the Byzantine Academy, concerts on the premises of the Casa dell'arte, a Jazz Festival, and there is the permanent Ravenna Chamber Ensemble. The main theatre is the Teatro Comunale Alighieri dating from 1852, but venues for the abundant music in Ravenna are spread throughout the city. * Reggio Emilia's Teatro Municipale has regular opera, concert, and ballet seasons, as well as being the site for two major festivals during the year: Reggio Emilia Dance and the REC Autumn Festival. * Rimini sponsors a late summer music festival, the Sagra Musicale Malatestiana.

Gordon Scott makes his last appearance as Tarzan while Jock Mahoney appeared as villain Coy Banton. Mahoney would take over the Tarzan role himself beginning in the next film, Tarzan Goes to India in 1962. The motion picture does not include Jane.The AFI Catalog of Feature Films:..Tarzan the Magnificent Retrieved March 13, 2016 Plot The Bantons (father, Abel (John Carradine) and four sons, Coy (Jock Mahoney), Ethan (Ron McDonnell), Johnny (Gary Cockrell) and Martin (Al Mulock)) rob a pay office in a settlement, killing some people. Coy Banton is tracked down to their camp and taken away by a policeman, Wyntors (John Sullivan). Taking him back to town, Wyntors is killed as two of the brothers seek to rescue Coy. Tarzan appears and kills Ethan Banton. The other brother escapes. Tarzan decides to take Coy to Kairobi for the $5000 reward so he can give it to Wyntors' widow. However, no one in the town of Mantu (same town as the one at the beginning of Tarzan's Greatest Adventure) wants to help him. The boat he is waiting for to take him and his prisoner to Kairobi is ambushed by the Bantons, who send the passengers off and destroy the boat. Later that night Tarzan meets with the people from the boat and decides on an overland trek to take Coy Banton to Kairobi and agrees to take along, at first, the boat's mate, Tate (Earl Cameron), then reluctantly agrees to take the passengers of the boat: A business man named Ames (Lionel Jeffries) and his wife, Fay (Betta St. John); another man named Conway (Charles Tingwell) and a young woman named Lori (Alexandra Stewart), who all share with Tarzan their own reasons for wanting to go to Kairobi. But Tarzan warns them the trek through the jungles would be hard and dangerous. The presence of so many people to watch out for hinders Tarzan. The Bantons threaten to kill anyone who helps Tarzan. Pausing only to shoot the doctor who has told them what they want to know, the Bantons set out after the party and Coy. Ames is a boastful and racist windbag whose wife begins to detest him. Seeing this, Coy plays up to her, hoping he might be able to use her later. The party are captured by natives and the leader wants to kill Coy, who killed his brother when the Bantons raided their village. However, the chief's wife is having a difficult childbirth labour, and since Conway (who was a doctor) is able to help her have her baby (a breach birth), the chief agrees to let the party go. Coy sees his chance and escapes. Thanks to Ames, Tate is shot and later dies. Tarzan again captures Coy and he hides them both in a quicksand pit as the other Bantons search for them. Later, Lori wanders off and is caught by Johnny Banton who attempts to have his way with her. As she screams, Tarzan comes to rescue her and, after a fight, Johnny dies from a shot in the face with his rifle while struggling with Tarzan and falls into a stream. Later, seeing his grave (along with Tate's), Martin Banton has had enough of a father who taught them to steal and murder by age sixteen, and leaves him. Coy's wiles have paid off and Fay Ames releases him while the others sleep, and they leave camp together. Tarzan goes after them and finds Fay's scarf. Coy left her behind when she was out of breath and a lioness found her. Tarzan eventually comes on Coy and Abel Banton, and in a roving battle, a ricochet from Coy's rifle kills Abel. A prolonged battle on rocks, on sand and underwater follows before Tarzan finally knocks Coy out. The film ends with Tarzan and the remaining three people (Ames, Lori, and Conway) handing Coy over to the Kairobi police on the border and instructs Conway to make sure Wyntor's widow gets the reward money.

A Union Army brigade under Brig. Gen. Charles C. Walcutt fought three brigades of Georgia militia under Brig. Gen. Pleasant J. Philips, at Griswoldville (an industrial town), near Macon, Georgia, and continued its march toward Savannah. Background Sherman, victorious in the lengthy Atlanta Campaign, had refitted his army and recently departed from Atlanta on a march designed to reach the Atlantic Coast at Savannah. The right wing of Sherman's force was the Army of the Tennessee, commanded by Maj. Gen. Oliver Otis Howard. It encountered the first resistance to its march in Griswoldville. Walcutt was ordered to make a demonstration with his brigade (2nd Brigade, 1st Division, XV Corps) of six infantry regiments and one artillery battery (Battery B, 1st Michigan), toward Macon to ascertain the disposition of enemy troops in that direction. Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. Hugh Judson Kilpatrick had struck Griswoldville on November 21, capturing a train of 13 cars loaded with military supplies, and burning the station and some factory buildings. Battle Map of Griswoldville Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program Early on November 22, a detachment of Confederate cavalry under Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler attacked the 9th Pennsylvania Cavalry on the Gordon Road, killing one man, wounding two, and capturing eighteen. The 9th then charged the Confederates and drove them back nearly a mile across a creek, where the enemy was found in force, posted in order of battle. The Confederates advanced and drove in the Union skirmishers, but the 9th Pennsylvania and 5th Kentucky Cavalry made a saber charge that forced the Confederates to retire to their works. At this point, Walcutt's infantry brigade and artillery battery joined the cavalry. Walcutt threw out a strong skirmish line that drove the Confederates back through Griswoldville, after which, by orders of division commander Brig. Gen. Charles R. Woods, he fell back to the Duncan farm and took up a position on the edge of the woods, with an open field in his front and his flanks protected by a swamp. Here he threw up a barricade of rails and logs and a battery of artillery was also brought up. About 2 p.m., three brigades of Georgia militia under the command of Brig. Gen. Pleasant J. Philips attacked. The Georgia Militia had been ordered from Macon to Augusta, thinking the latter was Sherman‚Äôs next objective, and only accidentally collided with Walcutt‚Äôs force. The militia advanced in three compact lines, but were met by a shower of canister. They succeeded, however, in reaching a ravine about 75 yards from Walcutt's works, where they reformed their lines and from which they made three desperate charges on the Federal position, all repulsed with heavy losses. The militia then tried to turn the Federal flanks, but finding these well protected by cavalry, retired to the ravine, remained there until dark, and then withdrew from the field. General Walcutt was wounded early in the engagement, and brigade command fell to Col. Robert Francis Catterson of the 97th Regiment Indiana Infantry. Aftermath The Union losses were 13 killed, 79 wounded, and 2 missing. Confederate losses are estimated at 51 dead, 472 wounded, and about 600 captured. General William Tecumseh Sherman's march to the sea continued.Eicher, p. 766. After the Civil War, this industrial community of Griswoldville--a source for Confederate military supplies during the war--was not rebuilt. Preservation The Civil War Trust, a division of the American Battlefield Trust, and its partners have saved a 17-acre tract of the battlefield on Baker Road near Little Sandy Creek. It is managed by Georgia State Parks. A roadside monument and interpretive wayside markers are at the site on Baker Road near the intersection with Griswoldville Road.

H. Stanhope in his Reign of Queen Anne (v. 1, p. 104-105) writes about him, \\"The second event boding ill to France was an insurrection in Languedoc. There the poor Protestants had for some years past groaned under most cruel persecution. The exercise of their religion was denied them; and if ever they presumed to meet for worship among the bleak hills of the Cevennes they were pitilessly tracked, pursued, and cut down. Scarce any worse persecutors are recorded in history than M. de Baville, Intendant of the Province, and Abbe du Chaila, inspector of the missions, and arch-priest, as he was called, of the Cevennes. The latter among other atrocities was wont to renew upon his prisoners the torments sustained by the early Christians in the reign of Nero, when they were smeared with combustibles and set on fire as living torches. In the same spirit, though not to the full perfection of his model, Du Chaila would direct that wool steeped in oil should be tied around the hands of the Protestants whom he succeeded in seizing, and should burn until their fingers were consumed. At last a party of insurgents surprised at Pont de Montvert the house of this ferocious priest, who barricaded himself in the upper chambers while the vaults below were thrown open, and some of his maimed victims were seen to issue forth. At this sight the excited multitude heaped wood and kindled it around the house, and it seems as a just retribution of Providence that Du Chaila himself perished in the flames.\\" References *Massacres of the South (1551‚Äì1815), by Alexandre Dumas, p√®re - chapter II has an excellent account of the life and martyrdom of abbe de Chayla. * \\"The murder of the abbot of Chaila\\", English translation.

He was Professor of Mental and Moral Philosophy at Vanderbilt University from 1891 to 1910. He served as bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South from 1910 to 1943. Early life Collins Denny was born in Winchester, Virginia, on May 28, 1854. His father was William R. Denny and his mother, Margaret A. Collins. He had a sister, later married to M. D. James of San Antonio, Texas. Denny was educated in Winchester. He graduated Princeton University, where he was captain of the 1875 football team. He attended graduate school at the University of Virginia, and received a Doctorate of Divinity from Randolph‚ÄìMacon College, Emory and Henry College, and Washington and Lee University. Career Denny entered the ordained ministry of the Baltimore Annual Conference of the M.E. Church, South in 1880. Denny was Professor of Moral and Mental Philosophy at Vanderbilt University from 1891 to 1910. Much of the coursework relied on the writings of Noah K. Davis, due to Denny's admiration of Davis. One of his students was John Crowe Ransom. When he became ordained as bishop in 1910, Denny tried to \\"impose theological control over the university.\\" As a result, he was dismissed by Chancellor James Hampton Kirkland, and replaced by Herbert Charles Sanborn. Denny never accepted the legitimacy of the Methodist Church, preferring to regard himself as a bishop in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. He was retired as a bishop in 1932, but continued to challenge the proposed unification of the M.E. Church and M.E. Church, South. He and his son, Collins Denny Jr., took their legal challenge to the U.S. Supreme Court. The court ruled that it had no jurisdiction in the matter, which ended all challenges to the 1939 unification of The Methodist Church. Prior to his election to the episcopacy, Collins toured Asiatic Missions, 1886‚Äì87. He served as the chaplain of the University of Virginia, 1889‚Äì91. As a bishop he was a member of the Fourth Ecumenical Conference, Toronto, 1911. Personal life Denny married Lucy Chase Chapman. They had a son, Collins Denny Jr., who became a pro- segregationist lawyer in Virginia. They also had four daughters, all of whom were married: Mrs John W. Dixon of Parksley, Virginia; Mrs Eugene E. Vann of Leonia, New Jersey; Mrs Roscoe M. White of Richmond, Virginia; and Mrs Preston W. Slosson of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Death and legacy Denny died 12 May 1943 in Richmond, Virginia.

It is acutely toxic to birds and humans, so it has been banned in the U.S., the E.U., India and many other countries. Uses Monocrotophos is principally used in agriculture, as a relatively cheap pesticide. However, it is also used frequently as a tool to commit suicide. Monocrotophos is believed to be the contaminant responsible for the death of 23 schoolchildren in a Bihar, India school. They ate a state- provided school lunch in the district of Saran in India in July 2013 which was prepared in oil kept in the container of this pesticide.The poison pill in India's search for cheap foodChildren Die from Tainted Lunches at Indian School Accessed 21/08/2016 Toxicity To wildlife Widespread bird kills, including a large kill of Swainson's Hawks in Argentina, have resulted from the use of monocrotophos. Diabetogen In the study published in Genome Biology, the researchers demonstrated the gut microbiota mediated diabetogenic effect of organophosphate insecticides. They used monocrotophos as the prototypical organophosphate in their study and showcased that during chronic intake, monocrotophos is degraded by the gut microbiota and the end products are converted to glucose via gluconeogenesis that account for glucose intolerance. All the studies were validated in human samples from the villages in Madurai. Cardiotoxicity In a recent study, Wistar rats were administered 1/50 of dosage of monocrotophos (0.36 mg/kg body weight) orally via gavage daily for three weeks. Animals administered Monocrotophos exhibited mild hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia in the blood. Cardiac oxidative stress was conferred by accumulation of protein carbonyls, lipid peroxidation and glutathione production. The cardiac markers (cTn-I, CK-MB and LDH) showed elevated levels in blood plasma, which indicates cardiac tissue damage. The histopathology of the heart tissue authenticated the monocrotophos induced tissue damage by showing signs of nonspecific inflammatory changes and edema between muscle fibres. Thus the findings of this preliminary study illustrate the cardiotoxic effect of prolonged monocrotophos intake in rats and suggest that MCP can be a possible independent and potent environmental cardiovascular risk factor. Acute effects Nerve growth factor (50 ng/ml) induced functional differentiation in PC12 cells has been reported. The studies have been carried out showing mitochondria mediated apoptosis in PC12 cells exposed to monocrotophos. A significant induction in reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxides, and the ratio of glutathione disulfide/reduced glutathione was observed in cells exposed to selected doses of monocrotophos. Following the exposure of PC12 cells to monocrotophos, the levels of protein and mRNA expression of caspase-3, caspase-9, BAX, p53, p21, PUMA, and cytochrome-c were significantly upregulated, whereas the levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-w, and Mcl-1 were downregulated. TUNEL assay, DNA laddering, and micronuclei induction show that long-term exposure of PC12 cells to monocrotophos at higher concentration (10‚àí5 M) decreases the number of apoptotic events due to an increase in the number of necrotic cells. Monocrotophos-induced translocation of BAX and cytochrome-c proteins between the cytoplasm and mitochondria confirmed the role of monocrotophos in the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondria mediated apoptosis induction was confirmed by the increased activity of caspase cascade. These apoptotic changes could be correlated with elevated levels of expression of selected cytochrome P450s (CYP1A1/1A2, 2B1/2B2, 2E1) in PC12 cells exposed to monocrotophos (10‚àí5 M).Monocrotophos Induced Apoptosis in PC12 Cells: Role of Xenobiotic Metabolizing Cytochrome P450s References External links  * Category:Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors Category:Organophosphate insecticides Category:Carboxamides Category:Alkene derivatives Category:Pollutants ","title":"Monocrotophos"},{"id":"4534775","text":"Sharkolai (also known as Sharkulai or Shark≈´lai) is a large village comprising more than two hundred houses in Mansehra District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.

He was perhaps best noted as a historian, researcher and popularizer of the works of Italian opera composer Gaetano Donizetti. Biography Ashbrook was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature from the University of Pennsylvania in 1946, and a Master's degree in musicology from Harvard University in 1947.Gossett, Philip, \\"In Memory of William Ashbrook\\", Opera Quarterly, November 18, 2009 Ashbrook began an academic career by teaching humanities and then, for nearly twenty years, was a member of the English Department at Indiana State University at Terre Haute. He retired in 1974 as Distinguished Professor Emeritus. From 1974 to 1984 he was professor of opera at the Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts (now the University of the Arts). Ashbrook died in Denver, Colorado at the age of 87. Ashbrook as opera scholar Although Ashbrook trained to be an English professor, he had a lifelong interest in Italian opera. In reference to his pioneering work in opera scholarship, musicologist Philip Gossett described him as \\"the father of us all\\" and his scholarly publications in the field of music far overshadowed his contributions in other areas. Opera studies were his lifelong passions, especially the life and operas of 19th-century Italian composer Gaetano Donizetti. One result was that \\"the town of Bergamo, inspired by the local Donizetti Foundation, did itself proud by proclaiming him an honorary citizen of Donizetti's birthplace.\\" He is best remembered for his 1965 biographical work on Donizetti and for the books The Operas of Puccini (1968; rev. 1985) and Donizetti and His Operas (1982), the latter described by Gossett as \\"for any serious study of a Donizetti opera today, it is with (this book) that one must begin\\". Ashbrook was also a regular contributor to several classical music journals, magazines, and other publications, including Opera News, Opera, Donizetti Society Journal and the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.

It was originally simply named \\"BBC\\", the initials of Bombay Bicycle Club, a restaurant Hunt had frequented as a young man in Chicago.Dominick Dunne's Power, Privilege, and Justice ‚Äì Episode \\"Billionaire Boys Club\\" The \\"get rich quick\\" investments the group offered to clients added up to what was essentially one big Ponzi scheme. The club enticed the sons of wealthy families from the Harvard School for Boys (now Harvard-Westlake School; not affiliated with Harvard University) in the Los Angeles area with get-rich- quick schemes. Given their inexperience and difficulty succeeding independently of their families, an organization like the BBC proved attractive to these young men. Due to the reputation of the organization for being composed of young, inexperienced men from moneyed families, it was jokingly referred to as the \\"Billionaire Boys' Club\\". Hunt himself came from a single-parent family in the lower-middle-class suburb of Van Nuys, and was able to attend the Harvard School only with the help of scholarships. In 1984, Hunt was arrested for murdering Ron Levin, the group's main investor and himself a con artist, and Hedayat Eslaminia, the father of one of the club's members. The story was recounted in a 1987 miniseries and a 2018 film. Crime The organization was run as a Ponzi scheme,  and money contributed by investors was spent on supporting lavish lifestyles for young members of the club. Hunt and club security director Jim Pittman were charged with the murder of Levin, a con artist who had allegedly swindled the BBC out of over $4 million. Levin's body was never found, and Hunt maintains that Levin, who was under criminal investigation and out on bail at the time of his disappearance, instead fled the country to escape prosecution. When authorities began to investigate the murders, Dean Karny, the club's second- in-command and Hunt's best friend, turned state's evidence on both murders in return for immunity from prosecution on three different felony charges in exchange for testimony. BBC members Hunt, Pittman, Karny (before his immunity deal), Arben Dosti, and Reza Eslaminia were charged with the murder of Hedayat Eslaminia, Reza's father. They allegedly killed him to acquire his fortune, which was reputed to be $35 million (the senior Eslaminia was, in fact, nearly penniless). Trials and convictions In 1987 a Southern California Court found Hunt guilty of Levin's 1984 murder and sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Pittman was unable to make his $500,000 bail ($ million today), so he was kept incarcerated through two Southern California trials for his active role in the murder of Levin. Both ended in hung juries. In 1988, before a third trial, prosecutors offered Pittman a deal, whereby he pleaded guilty to being an accessory to murder after the fact and possession of a concealed weapon, and was sentenced to time served, being the 3 1/2 years he was incarcerated since his 1984 arrest. The trials for the murder of Hedayat Eslaminia were held in Northern California. With the testimony of accomplice Karny, both Dosti and Reza Eslaminia were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. Dosti and Reza both were released on appeal using evidence from Hunt's second trial, and Hunt was also acquitted of the Eslaminia murder charge. Hunt and Pitman's trials for murdering Levin had delayed their trials for murdering Eslaminia, with other pre-trial motions pushing Hunt's Northern California trial to 1992. Hunt acted as his own attorney during this trial and contended that star witness Karny had killed Eslaminia. The result was a hung jury, 8‚Äì4, in favor of Hunt's acquittal. Hunt is the only person in California legal history to represent himself in a capital case and not receive the death penalty. When prosecutors realized they likely could not convict Hunt nor Pittman, they dismissed all charges against Hunt and Pittman in the murder of Eslaminia. Subsequent events On May 20, 1993, a few months after all charges were dropped against him in the Eslaminia case, Pittman admitted on the television program A Current Affair to have participated in the Levin murder, confessing that he was the one who shot Levin and bragging that he was now untouchable in court due to the restriction on double jeopardy. Pittman, granted release with time served in two murders, died of kidney failure in 1997, age 44. The convictions of Dosti and Reza Eslaminia were overturned in 2000. During his trial for the murder of Levin, Hunt's defense attorney presented two witnesses, Carmen Canchola and Jesus Lopez, who testified that they saw Levin after his alleged murder, in September, 1986 at a gas station in Tucson, Arizona. Canchola and Lopez identified pictures of Levin from multiple photographic lineups as the same man they had seen at the gas station. The jury was not persuaded by these sightings and found Hunt guilty in 1987. On the basis of multiple witness statements that Levin had been seen alive, and claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and judicial misconduct, Hunt sought to have his murder conviction overturned and get a new trial. \\"Ron Levin is alive\\" theory Hunt maintains that Levin's con artistry extends to having faked his own death, as no body was found in the case. At the time of his disappearance, Levin was free on bail and awaiting trial, and Hunt's defense team argued that Levin left the country to escape a pending FBI investigation into his financial misdeeds. After Hunt's conviction, eight witnesses came forward stating that they had seen Ron Levin alive in various locations in 1986 and 1987, including Greece and Los Angeles. One witness, Nadia Ghaleb, who was acquainted with Levin, testified that she saw him getting into a car on San Vicente Boulevard in West Los Angeles; another, Ivan Werner, who worked as a funeral director at Pierce Brothers Funeral Home in Westwood, testified that he saw Levin attending a funeral. In his appeal, Hunt's defense counsel argued that key facts were withheld from jurors during his original trial for Levin's murder. These include Levin's \\"habit of writing large, worthless checks,\\" his conversations with witnesses about plans to leave for New York or for Granada, Spain, and a conversation with another witness requesting advice on how to dye his hair. Defense attorneys also pointed out that Levin had restructured his already-made bail arrangements to release his parents from liability, and asked one witness for information about Brazilian extradition treaties. There was also a purchase made using Levin's American Express card on the day after the murder was thought to have taken place, of fresh underwear from the Brooks Brothers store in Los Angeles, where Levin was known to shop. As of September 2018, Hunt's family has offered a $100,000 reward for evidence of Levin's whereabouts after June 6, 1984. Hunt's attempts to appeal his conviction Hunt's direct appeal was denied on July 12, 1996. However, in a federal habeas proceeding in 2004, Hunt's continuing effort to have his murder conviction overturned was revived, as the Ninth Circuit reversed a dismissal of his habeas petition. But this appeal, too, was ultimately unsuccessful. In June 2016, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the Central District of California's denial of Hunt's habeas corpus petition. In its affirmance, the court noted that \\"fairminded jurists could disagree\\" as to whether Hunt's trial lawyer was ineffective in his defense of Hunt, but cited the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996's \\"doubly deferential lens\\" in its refusal to overturn the Central District's decision. In October 2018, the Los Angeles Superior Court denied an additional habeas corpus petition.https://freejoehunt.com/wp- content/uploads/2018/10/habeas_petition_denial_10-5-18.pdf In January 2018, Hunt filed an application for commutation of his sentence, which would change it from life without possibility of parole to an indeterminate life term, which would give Hunt the opportunity to prove his rehabilitation before a parole board.https://freejoehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/LEGAL- ODYSSEY_-Commutation-Application-JAN-2018.pdf The petition notes that in prison, Hunt \\"is a different person: a chapel assistant and law clerk,\\" and \\"a voice for nonviolence\\". The petition also describes Hunt's in-custody record of conduct as \\"exceptional\\" and details his founding and facilitation of a men's spiritual group at the California State Prison in Sacramento where Hunt was imprisoned until 2012. In September 2018, Hunt's family and friends launched the website FreeJoeHunt.com in support of his release. In popular culture In 1987, NBC aired a miniseries based on the story of the Billionaire Boys Club, starring Judd Nelson as Joe Hunt, Brian McNamara as Dean Karny, and Ron Silver as Ron Levin. Hunt was the basis for Philip Swann, a character in the Law & Order Season 4 episode \\"American Dream,\\" which was subsequently adapted into the Law & Order: UK episode, \\"Unsafe\\". The Billionaire Boys Club is also the topic of two books: The Billionaire Boys Club by Sue Horton and The Price of Experience by Randall Sullivan. The murders are also the subject of the song \\"Things to Do Today\\" by Chicago band Big Black. On July 17, 2002, TruTV aired an episode of Dominick Dunne's Power, Privilege and Justice titled \\"Billionaire Boys Club\\", presented by author Dominick Dunne, which summarized the events surrounding the \\"club\\" and the kidnapping, murders, and trials. Investigation Discovery's Behind Mansion Walls revisited the case in the 2011 episode \\"Fatal Greed.\\" A feature film titled Billionaire Boys Club starring Ansel Elgort as Joe Hunt, Taron Egerton as Dean Karny, and Kevin Spacey as Ron Levin was released in 2018.  * The film debuted to a dismal opening night, grossing a meager $126.00, mainly due to the involvement of Spacey, who had months earlier been accused of several instances of sexual harassment and sexual assault. Judd Nelson, who played Hunt in the 1987 miniseries, played Hunt's father. The true-crime podcast series Hollywood & Crime, narrated by actor Timothy Olyphant, covered the subject in the summer of 2019.

The group was merged with Sacilor in 1986, becoming Usinor-Sacilor and was privatised in 1995, and renamed Usinor in 1997. In 2001 it merged with Arbed (Luxembourg) and Aceralia (Spain) to form the European company Arcelor, which became part of ArcelorMittal in 2006. History Sacilor and predecessors In 1704 Jean Martin de Wendel bought an Ironworks in Hayange in Lorraine (region), north- eastern France. Over the next one hundred years industrial production grew, and, in 1822 the first coke fired blast furnace in France was constructed. Further growth occurred under de Wendel family ownership in the next century; in 1850 approximately 20,000 tons of iron and cast iron each were produced, by 1869 this had increased 15 blast furnaces and a production of well over 100,000 tons of cast iron and iron each. Production included rails, bars, sheet, tin and wire. The company was split as a result of the Alsace-Lorraine region becoming part of Germany after that countries victory in the Franco- Prussian War in 1870. After Germany's defeat in the First World War the region returned to France, and the factories regained. Production continued to increase, with over 1.5million tons of iron and cast iron each produced in 1929. The Great Depression in France affected the company's ability to invest and in 1948 nine steelmakers formed the Soci√©t√© Lorraine de Laminage Continu (Sollac), pooling their resources to modernise. Further consolidation took place in the 1950s and 60s; Sid√©lor was formed from the Rombas and Hom√©court group of companies in 1950, in 1963 the Union des consommateurs de produits m√©tallurgiques et industriels (UCPMI) and Knutange merged to form the Soci√©t√© Mosellane de Sid√©rurgie (SMS). Sacilor (Soci√©t√© des Aci√©ries et Laminoirs de Lorraine) was first created in 1964 as a joint venture between the de Wendel and Sid√©lor groups (France for the construction of a modern steel plant in Gandrange, Lorraine. The groups themselves merged with SMS in 1967, forming de Wendel-Sid√©lor; in 1968 this group produced 40% of French production: 20million tons of Iron. The entire group became named Sacilor in 1973. Usinor and predecessors Usinor (Union Sid√©rurgique du Nord) was created in 1948 from the merger of Denain-Anzin (Les Hauts Fourneaux, Forges et Aci√©ries de Denain-Anzin) founded 1849 and Nord-Est (Les Forges et Aci√©ries du Nord et de l'Est) founded 1882. Both companies had their origins in ironworks founded in the first half of the 19th century in the modern day d√©partement of Nord. The company was formed for the consolidation of the steel works in the region, with a new plant in Denain, opened in 1952. Another factory, dedicated to steel sheet production was opened in Dunkirk in 1971, receiving materials by sea and from abroad. In 1963 merger with Lorraine-Escaut, also formed from the merger of older companies. (Senelle-Maubeuge, Longwy and Escaut et Meuse). The financial crisis of the 1970s affected the company negatively, and state investment grew. In 1979 another merger took place between Usinor and the smaller Chiers-Chatillon-Neuves Maisons. By 1981 90% of Usinor's shares were stated owned. Nationalisation and merger of Usinor and Sacilor The economic effects of the 1973 oil crisis affected both the steelmaking groups, already in debt from modernisation projects, and heavily reliant on state loans; in 1981 both Usinor and Sacilor was nationalised. Following another steel market crash in 1983, and the halt to subsidies to the steel industry brought in by the European Commission in 1986; Both companies were making heavy losses; in September 1986 the merger of Usinor and Sacilor was announced forming Usinor-Sacilor. Usinor-Sacilor, Usinor, and merger into Arcelor Further companies were absorbed into the group, Sollac in 1990, Ugine in 1991. In 1995 the company was privatised, and in 1997 the entire group renamed Usinor. In 1998 Cockerill-Sambre, a Belgian steelmaker was acquired. Usinor restructured as primarily a flat carbon steel producer in the last years of the 20th century, and disposed of several speciality steel product and long steel product businesses: the Usinor/Cockerill owned rolling mill manufacturer Forcast was sold to Akers (company) in 1998; in 1998/9 the subsidiary: Unimetal (long products) and its subsidiaries Trefileurope, and Societe Metallurgique de Revigny (SMR) were sold to Ispat International for approximately $107 million (693 francs);Sources:   railway wheelset and axle manufacturing subsidiaries Valdunes and RTM were sold to Freedom Forge Holding (Standard Steel, USA) in 1998; railway rail manufacturing subsidiary Sogerail (Hayange, France) was sold to British Steel plc in 1999. the special long products and forged products subsidiary Ascometal was sold to Lucchini S.p.A in 1999; and the electrical steel subsidiary UGO (Usinor Grains Orient√©s SA) was sold to Thyssen Krupp in 2000.Sources:  In 2001/2 the group merged with Arbed of Luxembourg and Aceralia of Spain to form Arcelor.

History  Origins (1882-1911)  The discovery of iron ore in Luxembourg in the 1850s and the introduction of metallurgy in 1876 led to the development of an important national steel industry, especially in the south of the country, and provided Luxembourg with sustained economic growth during the second half of the 19th century. This economic growth was greatly boosted during the two decades preceding World War I when large integrated steelworks, able to convert cast iron into steel and rolled steel, were constructed. Steel production surged from 145 313 tonnes in 1900 to 1 115 004 tonnes in 1913, and steel-making accounted for around 60% of total industrial employment in Luxembourg before World War I. The close economic relationship between Luxembourg and its neighbours, especially Germany, enabled investors to develop cross-border projects. As early as 1856, Luxembourg industrialists and members of parliament founded the Saarbr√ºcker Eisenh√ºttengesellschaft - Soci√©t√© en participation des Forges de Sarrebruck (\\"Saarbr√ºcken Ironworks shareholding company\\"). Similarly, German industrialists invested funds in the development of Luxembourg steel companies. South Luxembourg's important economic development due to steel production led to the creation of several steel- producing companies. In 1882, the Soci√©t√© Anonyme des Hauts Fourneaux et Forges de Dudelange (\\"High Furnace and Forging Mills of Dudelange Shareholding Company\\") was founded by the Soci√©t√© en commandite des Forges d'Eich, Le Gallais, Metz et Cie, founded in 1838, and the main shareholders of the Saarbr√ºcken shareholding company. As steel production increased exponentially, it soon became necessary to merge companies. In 1911, at an extraordinary general corporate meeting of the Soci√©t√© anonyme des Hauts Fourneaux et Forges de Dudelange, decision was taken to incorporate the Soci√©t√© anonyme des Mines du Luxembourg et Forges de Sarrebruck and the Soci√©t√© en commandite des Forges d'Eich, Le Gallais, Metz et Cie. into the Dudelange company. The new shareholding company, merging the three largest local steel companies, was named ARBED S.A., the acronym for Aci√©ries R√©unies de Burbach-Eich-Dudelange, Soci√©t√© Anonyme.  Growth and Development of ARBED (1911-1945)  ARBED headquarters in Luxembourg City, built in 1922. At its founding, ARBED operated 21 blast furnaces, 3 electric furnaces, 2 steelmaking plants and several rolling mills. In 1912, raw steel production from the ARBED works reached 824 500 tonnes. Although steel production almost halted during World War I, the following decades prove to be very successful. In order to further develop, ARBED took an international dimension and acquired and absorbed several companies in Belgium and Germany in the 1920s. At the end of World War I, German capital was withdrawn, and steelworks were taken over by groups with Franco-Belgian-Luxembourg capital. Two companies, Soci√©t√© Metallurgique des Terres Rouges and Soci√©t√© Mini√®re des Terres Rouges, were specifically created by ARBED and other French and Belgian companies for the purpose of acquiring plants and mines west of the Rhine which had to be sold by Germany as a consequence of the Treaty of Versailles. ARBED, already a major regional steel producer, further developed its international reach by establishing with the Soci√©t√© Metallurgique des Terres Rouges company a joint sales company called COLUMETA in 1920, and a joint shipping company called TRANSAF in 1922. In order to develop its international reach, an ARBED offshoot called Companhia Sider√∫rgica Belgo-Mineira was established in Sabar√°, Minas Gerais, Brazil, in 1921. As ARBED's growth continued, ARBED and Soci√©t√© Metallurgique des Terres Rouges finally merged in 1937. World War II severely affected steel production, and many steel mills were either destroyed or heavily damaged. Luxembourg had been officially absorbed into Germany, and ARBED was temporarily renamed H√ºttenwerke Burbach-Eich-Dudelingen (Burbach-Eich- Dudelange Metallurgical Plants).  \\"Les Trente Glorieuses\\" (1946-1974)  During the three decades following the end of World War II, ARBED played a key role in the development of the Luxembourg economy. During this period, called Les Trente Glorieuses (\\"The Thirty Glorious\\"), national raw steel production rose from 2.45 million tonnes in 1950 to 6.45 million tonnes in 1974, and Luxembourg reached an exceptional annual growth rate of 6.7% between 1946 and 1951, then a good average of 3.9% until 1975. During the first half of the 1970s, the steel industry represented close to 30% of the total sum of added value in the national Luxembourg economy, and more than half the total added value of industry. By 1974, Luxembourg steelworks and iron mines provided work for around 25 000 employees in 1974 (16% of the total national). During these three decades, ARBED not only developed its local plants but also increased the diversification of its activities. In 1962, ARBED became a partner in the creation of the maritime SIDMAR complex in Belgium, and later obtained a majority stake in the new company. In 1974, ARBED created TrefilARBED, as part of the extension of wire drawing activities, and Samarco, created through the mining company Samitri to develop iron ore resources in Brazil. A powerful regional European economic actor, ARBED gradually became a global actor through the magnitude of its operations.  World economic crisis and restructuring (1975-2002)  The 1973 oil crisis and its global repercussions had a dramatic impact on Luxembourg and on ARBED in particular, as it coincided with worldwide global steel overproduction. Despite ARBED's international sales network's restructuring in 1976 (Columeta was renamed TradeARBED) and the establishment of TrefilARBED Korea in 1978, by 1983, steel production had slumped back to 1955 levels (3.2 million tonnes, compared with 6.45 million tonnes in 1974). By 1985, the steel industry employed only half of its 1974-level work force. In 1978 ARBED becomes a 25% shareholder in M√©tallurgique et Mini√®re de Rodange-Athus (MMRA), mining and hot steel production is shut down and in 1994 MMRA merges with ARBED-Esch Schifflange to form Aci√©ries Rodange Esch-Schifflange (ARES) a subsidiary of ProfilARBED From 1982 to 1983, the Luxembourg steel industry was restructured and the Luxembourg government invested heavily in ARBED, finally owning 42.9% of the company's shares. Furthermore, during the following two decades, ARBED developed its international activities as well as its production of long steel products (steel bars and rods produced for a variety of uses such as building and bridge construction) and electric arc furnace steel while reducing its domestic steel-producing operations. Certain key events in the economic expansion of ARBED occurred in the 1990s. In 1990, ARBED jointly acquired Yates, a U.S. company specialising in the production of copper foil, with Japanese group Furukawa Electric. The following year, the Luxembourg company founded TrefilARBED Arkansas (USA), a steelcord plant in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. In 1992, it founded long steel products company Stahlwerk Th√ºringen in Germany. In 1993, ARBED founded ProfilARBED, a subsidiary company specialized in the production of long steel products and ARBED Americas, a subsidiary of TradeARBED, in 1994, to manage all United States commercial activities. ARBED also expanded by taking over other companies; in 1995, it obtained the majority of shares of German Kl√∂ckner Stahl, now Stahlwerke Bremen, and, in 1997, it developed a strategic partnership with Spanish steel company Aceralia (formerly CSI). However, during this period of geographic expansion and division of sectors, the remaining Luxembourg blast furnaces gradually stopped operating, the last one, in Belval, definitely halting its operations in 1997.  Arcelor and ArcelorMittal (2002 onwards)  Despite the end of its Luxembourg steel production, ARBED remained a global economic actor. Its diversification and development of its international scope enabled ARBED to remain competitive. In 2002, ARBED and two other European steel-producing and manufacturing companies, Spanish strategic partner Aceralia and French Usinor, merged into Arcelor. In 2006 Mittal Steel launched a takeover for Arcelor that led to the creation of ArcelorMittal..

It was renamed in honor of Sam Spiegel in 1996, with the support of the Sam Spiegel Estate. The school has been the subject of some 190 tributes and retrospectives in 55 countries at international festivals, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York (1996), the Rotterdam Festival (1997), the Havana Festival (1999), the Moscow Festival (1999), the Valladolid Film Festival (Spain, 2000), FIPA Festival - Biarritz (France, 2004) the Berlin International Film Festival (2004), the Hamptons Festival (2005) and the Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival in France (2005), and Sarajevo Film Festival (2008). In 2016 the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies at Cambridge University held a tribute to the school. The School has been the subject of a number of tributes and retrospectives. The school's films have won 420 international and local prizes, including twice the First Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. In 2008 Anthem, by Elad Keidan was awarded First Prize in the Student Film competition at the prestigious Cin√©fondation section. This marked the first ever such win by an Israeli student film in Cannes, and in 2015 Or Sinai won for her film Anna. 76% of the school's graduates work in the industry. Among the school‚Äôs most prominent alumni are Rama Burshtein, Nadav Lapid, Talya Lavie, Tom Shoval, Nir Bergman, Noah Stollman, Elad Keidan and Ra'anan Alexandrowicz. The former director of the New York Film Festival, Richard Pe√±a, said in 2011 at the tribute to the school at Columbia University: ‚ÄúIsraeli cinema can be divided into two periods‚Äîbefore and after the establishment of the Sam Spiegel Film & Television School.‚Äù History In 1988, a student protest took place at the film department of the Beit Zvi School of Art in Ramat Gan, then the sole film school supported by the state. Charging that Beit Zvi gave preference to the acting track, the film students demanded independence. The Education and Culture Minister at the time, President Yitzhak Navon established a public inquiry that supported their claims. He then decided to create a new independent, well-funded school for film and television, the first of its kind in Israel. The mayor of Jerusalem, Teddy Kollek, and Ruth Cheshin, president of the Jerusalem Foundation, saw a window of opportunity to ‚Äúbring the ocean to Jerusalem‚Äù, in their words. They committed to match government funding. In July 1989, Ruth Cheshin charged film director Renen Schorr with the task of making this new school a reality in four months‚Äô time. The school opened in Jerusalem in November 1989. Educational tracks The school works on a triangular model. One track is the \\"Full Track\\". In 1999, the school began a two-year track for screenwriters, with the aim of creating a model for cooperation between screenwriters and directors, and with a specialization in writing for television. In 2004, the first four-year track for entrepreneur producers in Israel was launched at the school. Each of the three tracks operates autonomously. The school trains its students to reach a synergy of the tracks, leading to future cooperation beyond the school framework.  Milestones  The school has worked to promote its students and graduates ‚Äì and by extension Israeli film and international film in general. * The Jerusalem Film and Television Fund was initiated in 2008 by Renen Schorr and is the first municipal film fund in Israel. Opening options for Israeli professionals and international filmmakers, the fund supports productions of films and television series shot in Jerusalem. * The Sam Spiegel International Film Lab was launched in December 2011, with the goal of fostering the development and production of full-length feature films by some of the world‚Äôs most promising young talents. The Lab became the third film lab of its kind in the world, along with The Sundance Institute and The Torino Film Lab in Italy. The Academy Award-winning film Son of Saul, by L√°szl√≥ Nemes was developed at the Sam Spiegel International Film Lab in 2015. * The Sam Spiegel Alumni Film Fund. Set up in 2014 in partnership with ARP Selection, France, with the aim of supporting alumni as they make their first feature film. Support from the Sam Spiegel Foundation, as well as the school, award $100,000 to a Sam Spiegel graduate in order to help produce a first feature film. * The Ha‚Äôaretz Short Script Prize a partnership with the Ha‚Äôaretz newspaper was initiated in 2015. Partnering also with the Gesher Foundation, the prize is granted to the best original screenplay for a film under 10 min. The winning script is published in both the print and online editions, and is produced within nine months of receipt of the prize. The completed film premieres at the Jerusalem Film Festival. * In 2017 an alliance between the school and SONY Classics was initiated. For the first time, as part of an annual venture, in April 2017, during the Tribeca Film Festival, SONY Classics chose four graduates of the Marcie Bloom Fellows and four graduates of the Sam Spiegel Film School for an active seminar in New York to create cooperation with leading film schools in the greater NY area.

While the West Bottoms is still home to several industrial buildings today, its antique shops and haunted houses are very popular. Additionally, there are several art galleries and restaurants located in the West Bottoms, and a few companies have offices in the area. History Kansas City's first Union Depot was located here. It was home to the Kansas City Live Stock Exchange and Kansas City Stockyards (now defunct) prompting the huge annual American Royal livestock show at Kemper Arena, the site of the 1976 Republican National Convention. Additionally, The West Bottoms was home to large industrial district which produced plows and tractors starting in the 1870s. Many of the factory buildings still stand. Some prominent examples are The Oliver Building, The Nichols and Shepard Building and The John Deere Building. The low-lying area has been prone to floods including the Great Flood of 1951 and the Great Flood of 1993. Jim Pendergast founded the political machine here that was furthered by Tom Pendergast. Tom Pendergast was an early supporter and promoter of Harry S. Truman in Jackson County and Missouri politics. Truman would later become President as Vice-President under Franklin D.

During World War II Darby Steel Corporation built most of the landing craft tanks (LCTs) that were used in various amphibious invasions. The plant built one craft a day and floated them more than 1,000 miles down the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers to New Orleans, Louisiana, prompting their \\"Prairie Ships\\" nickname. Darby's plant at the mouth of the Kansas River could hold eight 135√≠ LCTs and 16 LCMs in various stages of construction. Many Serbians arrived in the early 1900s and found work in the meat packing houses in the area. The Serbs founded St. George Serbian Orthodox Church on April 18, 1906. The community purchased two houses on North 1st Street. One was converted to a church and the other used as a parish home. The parish stayed in the West Bottoms until 1925 when they built a new church on Lowell Street still in Kansas City, Kansas. Today, the parish is located in Lenexa, Kansas, having built their third location in 2006.

It is a two-lane highway beginning at State Highway 10 east of Miami and ends at U.S. Highway 60 in Twin Bridges State Park on the north side of the Grand Lake o' the Cherokees. It has no lettered spur routes. SH-137 was established circa 1957. The highway's northern terminus was formerly US-69 Alternate in Quapaw, but the portion of highway from SH-10 to US-69 Alternate has since been removed from the state highway system. Route description SH-137 begins at an intersection with US-60 in Twin Bridges State Park. The intersection lies between the Neosho River and the Spring River, near the point where the two rivers merge to form the Grand Lake o' the Cherokees. From the terminus, the highway heads northwest out of the park. After clearing the park boundaries, the road curves to due west, then makes a sharp curve onto a due north course. Approximately north of the turn, the highway passes through the unincorporated location of Ottawa. The highway's terminus lies further north, at an intersection with SH-10. History SH-137 first appears on the 1958 state highway map. At this time, the route began at US-60 and continued north to SH-10 north of Ottawa as it does today. However, it continued north from there; its northern terminus was in Quapaw at what was then US-66 (present day US-69 Alternate). The highway had a gravel surface at this time. SH-137 was paved in its entirety by 1961. The route remained in this configuration throughout the remainder of the twentieth century. In 2002, the portion of highway north of SH-10 was stripped of its designation as SH-137 and turned over to Ottawa County, truncating the route to its present-day termini.

Heavilon Hall Tower  Heavilon Hall II (1895‚Äì1956) The current Bell Tower's inspiration comes from the bell tower that was part of the old Heavilon Hall, demolished in 1956. Heavilon Hall was dedicated on January 19, 1894, as part of Purdue's Engineering School. Four days later, the building caught fire and was destroyed. In light of this tragedy, James H. Smart, Purdue's president at the time, declared that a new tower would go up \\"one brick higher.\\" Smart's inspirational words have since become a sort of motto for the university. According to legend, however, the bell tower was actually built 9 bricks higher. This second Heavilon tower was completed in December 1895 with clocks on each of the four sides. On April 8, 1897, four bells were installed. These bells would mark every quarter-hour until Heavilon was demolished in 1956.  Purdue Bell Tower  Through a gift from the class of 1948, a new bell tower was completed in 1995. The new tower stands 160 feet tall and, like the original, has a clock on each of its four faces. The bells from the original Heavilon tower hang at the top of the tower and are struck by electric clappers to ring at the hour, half-hour and end of classes. In addition, a computerized carillon plays Purdue's fight songs and the alma mater at 12:20 pm, 5:00 pm, and 10:00 pm. At the base of the tower is a time capsule that is to be opened in 2095. The walkway under the tower including the time capsule In 2008, the bell tower was incorporated into the university's emergency notification system. The tower now contains a loudspeaker and sirens that can be heard outdoors throughout the academic portion of campus. One legend about the Purdue Bell Tower states that the seal underneath it is cursed, and that any student who walks across the seal will not graduate in four years. It is also said that if a couple kisses under the tower, and then walk past the nearby Stone Lion Fountain, they will eventually be married. On November 27, 2018, during repairs to the tower, one of the clock faces fell from a crane during routine repairs, bounced off the basket of an aerial work platform holding two workers, and hit the side of the tower on its way to the ground. No people were injured by the falling clock. The incident was captured on video.

He was an ancestor of the Dukes of Somerset. Origins He was the son of Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford (1539‚Äì1621), by his wife Lady Katherine Grey (died 1568), a younger sister of Lady Jane Grey, \\"The Nine Day Queen\\". His grandfather was Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (executed 1552), all of whose titles became forfeit on his attainder by the Parliament of England, during the reign of his nephew King Edward VI (reigned 1547‚Äì1553). His father was however re-elevated to the peerage in 1559 by Queen Elizabeth I (1558‚Äì1603), as Baron Beauchamp of Hache and Earl of Hertford. During the lifetime of his father, whom he predeceased, he was known by the courtesy title (his father's lesser title) \\"Lord Beauchamp\\". He was born in the Tower of London, where his mother had been imprisoned for secretly marrying his father, against the wishes of Queen Elizabeth I. His mother was already pregnant when she entered the Tower, and was given poor living conditions, apparently in the hope that she would either miscarry or die. For many years, her children were regarded as illegitimate because no proof could be produced of her legal marriage. Claimant to throne By 1603 Edward was the senior qualified heir under the will of King Henry VIII, which stipulated that the elder line of the Stuart dynasty, descended from Margaret Tudor, should be passed-over in favour of the younger line, descended from Mary Tudor, the king's younger and favourite sister. Edward's only possible rival under the will was Anne Stanley, Countess of Castlehaven, who would have been heir had Edward been considered illegitimate. Regardless of Henry VIII's wishes, the succession progressed in favour of the elder line, which resulted in King James VI of Scotland ascending the English throne. Had the stipulations of the King's will been carried out, Edward would have become \\"King Edward VII\\" and England and Scotland would not have been placed under a personal union. Queen Elizabeth I never officially dismissed her father's will, but James succeeded through the support of the English Parliament. Marriage and children Edward married Honora Rogers, daughter of Sir Richard Rogers (c. 1527‚Äì1605) of Bryanston, Dorset, MP for Dorset in 1572, by his wife Cecilia Luttrell, daughter of Sir Andrew Luttrell (1484‚Äì1538), feudal baron of Dunster of Dunster Castle in Somerset. Honora was the sister of Andrew Rogers (d. circa 1599), MP, of Bryanstone, who earlier had married (as his second wife) Lord Beauchamp's aunt Lady Mary Seymour (born 1552). Beauchamp's father the Earl was strongly opposed to the marriage and sent a certain George Ludlow to discuss the position with the Rogers family. Ludlow reported back that Honora was \\"a baggage\\" and her father Sir Richard Rogers \\"a fool\\" and that Lord Beauchamp had originally intended to have \\"but a night‚Äôs lodging with her\\". The Earl believed that Sir Richard had encouraged the marriage and that \\"though outwardly he did nothing\\" to oppose or promote the marriage, nevertheless his daughter had \\"inwardly his goodwill\\". By his wife Honora he had three sons and three daughters: *Edward Seymour, Lord Beauchamp (1586‚Äì1618), who married Lady Anne Sackville, daughter of Robert Sackville, 2nd Earl of Dorset. He predeceased his grandfather the 1st Earl of Hertford and died without issue. *William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset (1588‚Äì1660) and 2nd Earl of Hertford, who in 1660 eventually regained the Dukedom which had been granted to his great-grandfather Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (c. 1500 ‚Äì 1552). *Francis Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Trowbridge (c. 1590 ‚Äì 1664), of Marlborough Castle, the grandfather of Francis Seymour, 5th Duke of Somerset (1658‚Äì1678) and of his younger brother Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset (1662‚Äì1748), \\"The Proud Duke\\". * Honora Seymour (bef. 1594‚Äì1620), wife of Sir Ferdinando Sutton, son of Edward Sutton, 5th Baron Dudley. * Anne Seymour * Mary Seymour Death and succession He predeceased his father the 1st Earl of Hertford, and was succeeded in the courtesy title by his eldest son Edward Seymour, Lord Beauchamp (1586‚Äì1618), who also predeceased the 1st Earl, and it was thus his second son William Seymour, who in 1621 succeeded his grandfather as 2nd Earl of Hertford and in 1660 was restored as 2nd Duke of Somerset.

It is the first book of a trilogy that continues with As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning (1969) and A Moment of War (1991). It has sold over six million copies worldwide. The novel is an account of Lee's childhood in the village of Slad, Gloucestershire, England, in the period soon after the First World War. It chronicles the traditional village life which disappeared with the advent of new developments, such as the coming of the motor car, and relates the experiences of childhood seen from many years later. The identity of Rosie was revealed years later to be Lee's distant cousin Rosalind Buckland.Once Upon a Time in a Village, BBC documentary broadcast on 4 January 2007  Summary  Rather than follow strict chronological order, Lee divided the book into thematic chapters, as follows: * First Light describes Laurie arriving with his mother and the rest of the family at a cottage in the Cotswolds village of Slad, Gloucestershire. The children gorge themselves on berries and bread as their harassed mother tries to get the cottage and the furniture into some kind of order. The house relies on a small wood-fire for the cooking and a hand pump in the scullery for its water. They are visited by a man in uniform who is sleeping out in the surrounding woods ‚Äì he visits them in the mornings for food and to dry out his damp clothes. He is finally taken off by men in uniform as a deserter. The chapter ends with the villagers riotously celebrating the end of the Great War. * First Names describes Laurie still sleeping in his mother's bed until he is forced out of it by his younger brother, Tony, and made to sleep with the two elder boys. As he grows older, he starts to recognise the villagers as individuals: Cabbage-Stump Charlie, the local bruiser; Albert the Devil, a deaf mute beggar; and Percy-from-Painswick, a clown and ragged dandy who likes to seduce the girls with his soft tongue. Owing to its location, the cottage is in the path of the floods that flow into the valley, and Laurie and his family have to go outside to clear the storm drain every time there is a heavy downpour, though even this sometimes fails to stop the sludge despoiling their kitchen. * Village School :The female teacher is called Crabby B, owing to her predilection for suddenly hitting out at the boys for no apparent reason. However, she meets her match in Spadge Hopkins, a burly local farmer's boy, who leaves the classroom one day after placing her on top of one of the cupboards. She is replaced by Miss Wardley from Birmingham, who \\"wore sharp glass jewellery\\" and imposes discipline that is \\"looser but stronger\\". * The Kitchen This chapter describes the Lees' domestic life. At the beginning Lee makes a reference to his father, who had abandoned them, saying that he and his brothers never knew any male authority. After working in the Army Pay Corps their father entered the Civil Service and settled in London for good. As Lee says, :Lee describes each member of the family and their daily routine, his sisters going off to work in shops or at looms in Stroud, and the younger boys trying to avoid their mother's chores. In the evenings the whole family sits around the big kitchen table, the girls gossiping and sewing as the boys do their homework and the eldest son, Harold, who is working as a lathe handler, mends his bicycle. * Grannies in the Wainscot describes the two old women who were the Lees' neighbours, Granny Trill and Granny Wallon, who were permanently at war with each other. Granny Wallon, or 'Er-Down-Under, spends her days gathering the fruits of the surrounding countryside and turning them into wines that, over the course of a year, slowly ferment in their bottles. Granny Trill, or 'Er-Up-Atop, spends her days combing her hair and reading her almanacs. As a young girl she had lived with her father, a woodsman, and she still seeks comfort in the forest. The two old women arrange everything so that they never meet, shopping on different days, using different paths down the bank to their homes, and continuously rapping on their floors and ceilings. One day Granny Trill is taken ill and quickly fades away. She is soon followed by Granny Wallon, who loses her will to live. * Public Death, Private Murder describes the murder of a villager made good who returns from New Zealand to visit his family, boasts about his wealth and flaunts it in the local pub. The police try to find his attackers but are met by a wall of silence, and the case is never closed. * Mother is Lee's tribute to his mother, Annie (n√©e Light). Having been forced to leave school early because of her mother's death, and the need to look after her brothers and father, she then went into domestic service, working as a maid in various large houses. Having left to work for her father in his pub, The Plough, she then answered an advertisement, \\"Widower (four children) Seeks Housekeeper\\" and met the man who became Lee's father. After four happy years together, and three more children, he abandoned them. Lee describes his mother as having a love for everything and an extraordinary ability with plants, being able to grow anything anywhere. As he says, * Winter and Summer describes the two seasons affecting the village and its inhabitants. During one particularly cold winter the village boys go foraging with old cocoa-tins stuffed with burning rags to keep their mittenless hands warm. The week before Christmas the church choir goes carol-singing, which involves a five-mile tramp through deep snow. Calls at the homes of the squire, the doctor, the merchants, the farmers and the mayor soon fill their wooden box with coins as they light their way home with candles in jamjars. In contrast, the long hot summer days are spent outdoors in the fields, followed by games of \\"Whistle-or-'Oller-Or-We-shall-not-foller\\" at night. * Sick Boy is an account of the various illnesses Lee suffered as a young boy, some of which brought him to the brink of death. He also writes about the death of his four-year-old sister Frances, who died unexpectedly when Lee was an infant. * The Uncles is a vivid description of his mother's brothers, his uncles Charlie, Ray, Sid and Tom. All of them fought as cavalrymen in the Great War and then settled back on the land, though Ray emigrated to Canada to work on the transcontinental railway, the Canadian Pacific, before returning home. * Outings and Festivals is devoted to the annual village jaunts and events. Peace Day in 1919 is a colourful affair, the procession ending up at the squire's house, where he and his elderly mother make speeches. The family also makes a four-mile hike to Sheepscombe to visit their grandfather and Uncle Charlie and his family. There is also a village outing on charabancs to Weston-super-Mare where the women sunbathe on the beach, the men disappear down the side-streets into pubs and the children amuse themselves in the arcade on the pier, playing the penny machines. There is also the Parochial Church Tea and Annual Entertainment, to which Laurie and his brother Jack gain free admittance for helping with the arrangements. They finally get to gorge themselves on the food laid out on the trestle-tables in the schoolhouse and Laurie plays his fiddle accompanied by Eileen on the piano to raucous applause. * First Bite at the Apple describes the growth of the boys into young adolescents and the first pangs of love. Lee states that \\"quiet incest flourished where the roads were bad\\", and states that the village neither approved nor disapproved, but neither did it complain to authority. Lee is seduced by Rosie Burdock underneath a haywagon after drinking cider from a flagon: :There is also a plan among half a dozen of the boys to rape Lizzy Berkeley, a fat 16-year-old who writes religious messages on trees in the wood, on the way back from church. They wait for her one Sunday morning in Brith Wood, but when Bill and Boney accost her she slaps them twice and they lose courage, allowing her to run away down the hill. Lee says that Rosie eventually married a soldier, while Jo, his young first love, grew fat with a Painswick baker and lusty Bet, another of his sweethearts, went to breed in Australia. * Last Days describes the gradual breaking up of the village community with the appearance of motor cars and bicycles. The death of the squire coincides with the death of the church's influence over its younger parishioners, while the old people just drop away: :Lee's own family breaks up as the girls are courted by young men arriving on motorcycles. This marks the end of Lee's rural idyll and his emergence into the wider world. :This is also the time when Laurie Lee experiences the first stirrings of poetry welling up inside him. Adaptations Cider with Rosie was dramatised for television by the BBC on 25 December 1971, with Country Life later commenting that Hugh Whitemore's script was \\"rendered into a beguiling, sunny fantasy under Claude Whatham's softly focused direction.\\" Music was by Wilfred Josephs, and Rosemary Leach was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress for her roles as Lee's mother and as Helen in The Mosedale Horseshoe. Also in the 1970s, the book was turned into a stage play by James Roose-Evans. It was performed in the West End and later at the Theatre Royal, Bury St Edmunds, and at the Phoenix Arts Theatre, Leicester, with Greta Scacchi. In 1998, not long after the death of Laurie Lee, Carlton Television made the film Cider with Rosie for the ITV network, with a screenplay by John Mortimer and with archive recordings of Laurie Lee's voice used as narration. The film starred Juliet Stevenson and was first broadcast on 27 December 1998. The book was also adapted for BBC Radio 4 in 2010. There was a second BBC Television production for BBC One, directed by Philippa Lowthorpe, with Samantha Morton as Annie Lee, Timothy Spall as the voice of Laurie Lee, and Annette Crosbie in the cast, which aired on 27 September 2015.

Although no fighting actually took place, it marked the end of de jure peace between the Han dynasty and Xiongnu, and led to the beginning of the subsequent Han-Xiongnu War. The failure of the operation also motivated the Han court to develop effective cavalry forces and the use of offensive expeditionary military policies. Background Before the Battle of Mayi, there had been two main encounters between the Chinese and the Xiongnu. During the Warring States period, General Li Mu of the State of Zhao defeated the Xiongnu by luring them deep inside Zhao territory and ambushing them. With similar tactics, General Meng Tian of the Qin dynasty drove the Xiongnu north for 750 km and built the Great Wall at the edge of the Loess Plateau to guard against future raids. However the collapse of the Qin dynasty and the subsequent chaos of the Chu-Han contention created a power vacuum and allowed the Xiongnu to unite under Modu Shanyu and became a powerful nomadic confederacy. After Emperor Gao's humiliating defeat at Baideng by Modu in 200 BC, the newly established Han dynasty was forced to resort to an appeasement policy in order to decrease the scale of Xiongnu hostility, as the nation had yet to fully recover from the attrition of the Chu-Han contention. However, despite the periodic gifts and heqin (\\"peace through marriage\\"), border townships and villages were still seasonally ravaged by nomads, as the prosperous Chinese lands remained attractive to Xiongnu raids. After seven decades, the Han dynasty had built up its military strength. Emperor Wu initially maintained a policy of peace and appeasement in his early reign, but began to formulate ideas of striking a major blow back against the Xiongnu. The traditional Chinese strategy was more conservative and defensive, aiming to lure the Xiongnu cavalry into Chinese territory, on terrains where the Chinese army, composed almost entirely of infantry and charioteers, would be at a counteroffensive advantage. Ambush In 133 BC, at the suggestion of Wang Hui, the minister of vassal affairs, Emperor Wu had his army set a trap for the Xiongnu Shanyu at the city of Mayi. A powerful local trader/smuggler, Nie Wengyi, also known as Nie Yi, deceptively claimed to Junchen Shanyu that he had killed the local magistrate and was willing to offer the city to the Xiongnu. The plan was to entice the Shanyu's forces into advancing on Mayi, so that a 300,000-strong Han force hidden around the area could encircle and ambush them. The plan failed, ironically, because the Han arrangement was made excessively attractive. When the Shanyu took the bait and moved in for a raid on Mayi, he saw fields full of cattle but with no herders. Feeling increasingly suspicious, the Shanyu ordered his men to halt their advance. Xiongnu scouts then captured a Han soldier from a local outpost, who disclosed the entire plan to the Shanyu. Shaken with shock, the Shanyu then abandoned the raid and withdrew quickly before the Han forces could act. The Han forces were scattered at this point, and unable to concentrate in time to catch the Xiongnu. Wang Hui, the commander of the entire Han operation, had only 30,000 troops under his direct command, too few to stop the Xiongnu from retreating to the steppe, so he hesitated and ordered the Han forces not to pursue. As a result, neither side suffered any casualties. Aftermath Back at the imperial court, Wang Hui's political enemies blamed him for the plan's failure and his reluctance to pursue the retreating Xiongnu army, and had him impeached. While awaiting trial, he sent men to bribe the chancellor Tian Fen, who is Emperor Wu's maternal uncle, in the hope of obtaining a parole. When Emperor Wu still refused to spare Wang (possibly because the emperor was wary of Tian Fen's growing power), he committed suicide in prison. Though border military clashes had already continued for decades between the two sides, this \\"battle\\" ended the de jure \\"peace\\" between the Han and Xiongnu. The ambush operation revealed the Han dynasty's hawkish stance, and the \\"marriage/gift for peace\\" policy was officially abandoned. For the next few years, Xiongnu would increase their border attacks, further solidifying the cause of pro-war factions and their control in the Han court. The result of the battle made Emperor Wu realize the difficulty for the traditionally chariot/infantry- orientated Han army to achieve tactical superiority against the more mobile Xiongnu cavalry. This led to a change in Han strategy and hastened the development of an effective cavalry doctrine. In later campaigns, the Han dynasty went from a defensive-counteroffensive stance to an offensive strategy of launching expeditionary warfare deep into Xiongnu territory. The failure of the Mayi operation also prompted Emperor Wu to reconsider his choice of commanders. Disappointed at the ineffectiveness of existing generals, Emperor Wu began to look for younger generations of military hopefuls capable of offensive anti-cavalry warfare. That led to the rise of famous new-generation tacticians like Wei Qing and Huo Qubing, and old-school commanders like Li Guang and Han Anguo began to fall out of favor.

Three of its campuses (Edyth B. Lindner Campus, Founders' Campus, and Martha S. Lindner Campus) are located in northern Cincinnati, in Sycamore Township and Symmes Township, near the intersection of Interstate 71 and Interstate 275. The Otto Armleder Memorial Education Center is located in downtown Cincinnati. History Overview The school was founded, in large part by Cincinnati businessman Carl Lindner, Jr., in 1989 on a plot of land. In its first year, it enrolled 165 students in pre-kindergarten through seventh grade. It has since expanded to an Early Learning Program for PK2-PK4, a Lower School for grades KPrep ‚Äì 6, and the city's only Christ-centered six- year college prep upper school experience for grades 7‚Äì12. The downtown campus is home to students preschool age 3 ‚Äì Grade 6. CHCA has an enrollment of 1300 students in 2017. Edyth B. Lindner Campus The construction of the Edyth B. Lindner Elementary School adjacent to the original campus building took place in 1992. This elementary school originally housed preschool through Grade 3. This campus is now home to the Blake Lindner Thompson Early Childhood Learning Center for preschool students ages 2‚Äì4, and the Lower School Grades KPrep ‚Äì 3.  Founders' Campus  This original CHCA campus building is now home to CHCA's Lower School Grades 4‚Äì6 Upper Elementary Program, as well as Upper School Grades 7‚Äì8, the early years of CHCA's six-year college prep experience.  Martha S. Lindner Campus  In 2001, this high school was constructed on a nearby plot of land. In 2008, a $3 million addition to the high school began. It was completed in January 2009. In 2016‚Äì2017, the school was expanded once more. It is home to CHCA's Upper School students Grades 9‚Äì12. Otto Armleder Memorial Education Center The school system purchased the historic Crosley Square Building in downtown Cincinnati to establish a school for inner-city students from pre-kindergarten to sixth grade. In March 2006, Lindner announced a $16 million gift to the school, which would allow the Armleder Center to add seventh and eighth grades to its kindergarten through sixth grade offerings, and would also fund scholarships for some Armleder students to continue their college-prep education through Upper School in Symmes Township. The school is now home to students in preschool ages 3‚Äì4 through Grade 6.

He was the great-nephew of Archbishop Arnulf II of Milan.L. Fasola, ‚ÄòArnulf von Mailand, Chronist,‚Äô in Lexikon des Mittelalters (Munich, 1980), 1, p. 1020. Arnulf is known for his work in five books, named Liber gestorum recentium, a \\"book of the deeds of recent times\\" (written 1072-1077). Arnulf describes his labour in the first book as \\"a simple narrative, offered in everyday speech, of the deeds accomplished by our kings, our bishops, and our fellow citizens from Milan and beyond, as well as our compatriots in the Kingdom of Italy, which I myself have seen or somehow heard from either those who saw them or those slightly later.\\"Quotations are from W. North's translation of the text edited by Claudia Zey. Unlike most Christian chroniclers of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages, Arnulf did not begin with the Creation (\\"Nevertheless, leaving aside antiquity, let us begin from recent memory\\") - the Liber gestorum recentium is a contemporary account of his times, as seen from the archbishopric of Milan. Arnulf's history begins in 925, with Hugh of Arles (\\"Hugh of the Burgundians\\") reigning as King of Italy and exercising his right to appoint an archbishop of Milan. It covers the years of the Gregorian reforms, the reform movement of the Milanese Patarenes, and the Investiture Controversy. It ends with the kingship granted to Rudolf von Rheinfeld as anti-king of the Germans (1077). Notes References *Arnulf of Milan, Liber gestorum recentium, ed.

Some ideas banks are used to develop new inventions or technologies. Many corporations have installed internal ideas banks to gather the input from their employees and improve their ideation process. Some ideas banks employ a voting system to estimate an idea's value. In some cases, ideas banks can be more humor- oriented than their serious counterparts. Sandstrom, C., & Bjork, J. (2010). Idea management systems for a changing innovation landscape. International Journal of Product Development, 11(3-4), 310-324. Many ideas banks are provided as free of charge, or set around certain companies in general to work out new inventions.See the definition for Open Source Hardware from the Open Source Hardware Association, http://www.oshwa.org/definition/ Although ideas are provided by a community of people, problems can arise when people take the ideas from the site and begin developing them.Dorta, T., Perez, E., & Lesage, A. (2008). The ideation gap:: hybrid tools, design flow and practice. Design studies, 29(2), 121-141. There is no possible way to prove that the idea on the ideas bank was original and not taken from something else. Innovation The front end of innovation is quite distinct from the remainder of the innovation process. When the very best ideas are discovered, they can be managed with a stage gate oriented project management system, where the work flow is defined. The front end of innovation is commonly referred to as \\"fuzzy\\" because it functions best when a collaborative system nurtures chaos, disruption and the serendipitous discovery of ideas. Most ideas submitted via an electronic suggestion box are limited to incremental innovation (doing things the way we always have but better). There is nothing wrong with incremental innovation, in fact the ideas leading to projects resulting from incremental innovation typically yield rapid revenue gains or cost savings. But most organizations are using collaborative idea management systems to get breakthrough or radical innovation (ideas that can be thought of as \\"out of the box\\" thinking\\"). The fuzzy front end of innovation benefits by having a collaborative tool serving as a backbone to nurture an organization's culture of innovation. Everyone can log into this system, post objects of interest to the other users, search for information, comment on information, discover experts in the organization when needed and as a result everyone is more well informed. In this sense the collaborative tool serves as a knowledge management system and is very Facebook-like, except everyone is talking about work. Of course the collaborative tool also accepts the submission of ideas. The idea management software solution manages these ideas by allowing others to comment on them, shaping the idea further, clustering them with similar ideas (utilizing the idea management software's similarity search capabilities) and accepting some sort of voting scheme in order to score the idea's worth. Better idea management software systems will use an algorithm to measure the \\"wisdom of the crowd\\" gauging social media type activity. In this instance that means the best ideas are automatically promoted when they get a combination of the most votes, the comments, the most votes on comments, the most views, the most \\"follows\\", the most \\"alerts\\", the most bookmarks and the most similar ideas posted...all combined in a mathematical formula to determine which idea is best as measured by the group of collaborators working on ideas. Unsolicited ideas typically lead to incremental innovation. To get to radical or breakthrough innovation, the idea management system needs to indulge in some strategic guidance by issuing challenges (or campaigns or seeding). In essence the bottom up grown organizational engagement of a collaborative idea management system is managed a little bit by some top down strategic guidance. The company is saying \\"We're glad you're all talking together, now do us a favor and talk about this...\\". They ask for ideas to address the big issues of the company, for instance \\"How do we make the company more 'green'\\". \\"What should our next new product be in the US\\"? This approach is often known as a corporate innovation programme. By collaborating, companies can assemble all the smart people in the company to exchange ideas, enhance each other's ideas and have the best ideas be automatically promoted (and you need an automated promotion mechanism in the software because the problem isn't that you won't get enough ideas, the problem is you'll get too many and you don't want someone to have to manually filter through them all). While idea management led to the installment of corporate social platforms for communication, research shows that focus must be put on the idea communication process. Good ideas need collegial elaboration and motivation, while resources should not be spent on ideas that are not applicable. Idea screening is an activity that will use the idea management platforms to fulful this taslk. Idea screening is an activity that consists of perception (the process of making sense and becoming aware) and judgement (reaching conclusions about what has been perceived). Given that organizations have limited resources, and cannot implement all of the ideas, idea screening acts as a bottleneck during the innovation processSukhov, Alexandre (2019). The human side of idea screening (PhD dissertation). Karlstads universitet. Retrieved from http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kau:diva-75769, accessed 2019-12-18.Thus far, research studies have mainly focused on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of idea screening through e.g. crowdsourcing, improving its accuracy, and even developing algorithms that mimic human evaluations. However, this pursuit of technical and procedural optimization has only reinforced the perception of idea screening as a strict decision gate, limiting our understanding of the human side of this phenomenon. Examples * As an open ideas bank project, Yle Kipin√§, was launched to increase public's involvement in how the Finnish media tax is spent. * As part of the adoption of enterprise social software, many companies have decided to use such a portal to allow their employees (on their intra-net) or their customers (on the internet) to collaborate in the process of raising new ideas. * Idea management software has the sole purpose of raising new ideas‚Äîfor new products, process improvements, employee welfare or any other corporate use. * Although not necessarily ideas banks per se, by allowing anyone to edit, wikis allow a group of people to work on information collaboratively. This collaborative writing can continue until all are satisfied with the article or piece of writing, but more often than not contributions continue as visitors add information, improve what is already there, and remove irrelevant or incorrect information. * Halfbakery is an example of a slightly less serious ideas bank. Users submit ideas, often jokingly, which are then commented on, often jokingly, by other users. * The Global Ideas Bank is the opposite of Halfbakery in that ideas are proposed seriously, and in some cases actually implemented. It started as a group of inventors in 1985 and became a large organization over several years until it was put online with its current name in 1995. * Founded in London in 2000, Idea a Day solicits submissions of original ideas from around the world, edits and publishes one considered example every day. A book, The Big Idea Book, comprising 500 of the best ideas, was published by Wiley in 2003. * In Ecuador, the National Secretariat for Higher Education, Science, Innovation and Technology, launched its own Idea Bank\\"El potencial innovador del pa√≠s se concentra en un 'Banco de Ideas to boost innovation and help local entrepreneurs get some funding and resources.

This description goes back to the Student Union's competition held in 1899,Nieders√§chsisches Jahrbuch f√ºr Landesgeschichte. Vol. 82, Hanover, 2010, p. 182. which was to encourage the erection of as many beacons as possible (and not observation towers). But other Bismarck towers, e.g., those that were purely beacons with no observation function, were often called Bismarck columns. History The world's first Bismarck tower now stands in Poland. It was erected by private initiative in 1869 in the village of Ober-Johnsdorf, Silesia, then part of Prussia (now Jan√≥wek, Poland). It stands on top of the hill now called Ja≈Ñska G√≥ra (), 253 m above sea level. The tower itself is 23 m in height. The sponsor was a retired Prussian officer Friedrich Schr√∂ter (1820‚Äì1888), a wealthy landowner in nearby W√§ttrisch. One year after Bismarck's death, German Studentenverbindung fraternities chose one of the designs submitted by the architect Wilhelm Kreis in an 1899 architecture competition. The award-winning G√∂tterd√§mmerung fire column design of granite or sandstone was selected as a standard model for all Bismarck towers. The massive and squat design could be built to different heights and widths depending on the amount of money donated for the particular monument. In manifestation of the Bismarck cult, they were built in various styles in locations across the German Empire, including its colonies in New Guinea (Gazelle Peninsula), Cameroon (near Limbe) and Tanzania, as well as in areas of Europe that, at the time, were part of Germany, but now lie within the borders of Poland, France, Denmark or Russia. Bismarck towers were also built in Austria, in the Czech Republic, and in Concepci√≥n, Chile. Every Bismarck tower was intended as a beacon, with their braziers lit on specified days in honour of the former chancellor to commemorate his achievement in unifying Germany in 1871. Though most towers included firing installations, plans for a nationwide beaconing failed, and many local initiatives chose deviating designs. The architects of these towers included Wilhelm Kreis himself, who built 58 (47 to the G√∂tterd√§mmerung design), and Bruno Schmitz.

On November 26, Wheeler caught up with two lagging Union regiments, attacked their camp, chased them to the larger force and prevented Kilpatrick from destroying the Briar Creek trestle. Kilpatrick instead destroyed a mile of track in the area. When Kilpatrick discovered that the Union prisoners at Camp Lawton had been taken to other unknown sites, he began to move southwest to join up with Maj. Gen. William T.

Wheeler came along the next morning, almost captured Kilpatrick, and pursued him and his men to Buck Head Creek. As Kilpatrick's main force crossed the creek, the 5th Ohio Cavalry regiment, under Col. Thomas T. Heath, supported by two artillery pieces, fought a rearguard action from behind a barricade of rails, severely punishing Wheeler's troopers with canister fire and then burned the bridge behind them. Wheeler soon crossed and followed, but a Union brigade behind barricades at Reynolds' Plantation halted the Rebels' drive, eventually forcing them to retire.

It is especially prevalent through the culturally mixed midland, an area through central Pennsylvania and through Ohio, Indiana and Illinois (or approximate to the old National Road, and now paralleled by Interstate 70). I-houses generally feature gables to the side and are at least two rooms in length, one room deep, and two full stories in height. They also often have a rear wing or ell for a kitchen or additional space. The facade of an I-house tends to be symmetrical. They were constructed in a variety of materials, including logs, wood frame, brick or stone. In his book on folk architecture in north-central Missouri, Marshall devotes nine pages to the I-house after investigation of close to 100 old houses in the ‚ÄúLittle Dixie‚Äù region of Missouri. He calls the I-house the ‚ÄúFarmer‚Äôs Mansion.‚Äù It is the Southern- style house sought by a middle-class planter, a symbol of his success. (DW Meinig introduces the I-house and the dogtrot as symbols of Southern influence in his Shaping of America.) In Little Dixie, originally settled primarily by migrants from the Upper South, settlers were so eager to build an I-house that many lived in tents until they completed their new buildings. Marshall classifies folk houses by type using rules developed by Henry Glassie in the late 20th century. The basic unit is a sixteen by sixteen foot ‚Äúhall‚Äù, called a pen. A single pen house might be a typical log cabin. Combinations define other types. A two-story, single pen house is known as a stack house. Pens can also be extended side by side to create a two-pen house, which with a central hall becomes a dogtrot. A two-story, two-pen house is the basic I-house. The house may by modified by additions, but the pen system provides a classification. These nineteenth-century houses lacked indoor plumbing and central heating. The classical I-house has fireplaces in each room. In Missouri I-houses were built from about 1820 to 1890. The style was brought to the US by the Scots-Irish. Because of the popularity and simple form of the I-house, decorative elements of popular architectural styles were often used. Through the 1840s, front porches and any decoration were primarily designed in the restrained Federal manner. The Greek Revival style was also used during the 1840s and 1850s. The I-house was also adapted to Gothic Revival and Italianate styles during the mid-19th century. Late 19th-century I-houses often featured Queen Anne and Eastlake-Stick style details. I-house with sheds (Plantation Plain) In the South a variation of the I-house, with one- story, rear shed rooms and usually a full-width front porch, is often referred to as the Plantation Plain house type. It is more accurately termed as an I-house with sheds.

In 1890, the city was annexed into Dallas, making Dallas the largest city in Texas.. By Jackie McElhaney and Michael V. Hazel. Retrieved 20 April 2006. Contrary to what its name implies, East Dallas is rich with culture both old and new; after the annexation, entrepreneurs and creatives occupied then shabby warehouses, turning them into clubs and venues, bringing culture and many social scenes that still thrive today in what is now Deep Ellum, among other neighborhoods of this district.  History  The area began as a 40-acre (162,000 m¬≤) tract east of the city of Dallas. The Beeman family had settled there in the 1860s and in 1872, William H. Gaston began promoting the area for development. Four families settled there at the time, but when the railroads came to Dallas, a number of railroad workers came and built houses between Dallas and East Dallas.. By Lisa C. Maxwell. Retrieved 16 October 2006. Gaston gave the railroad companies US$5,000 and free right-of- way through his land to persuade them to build through East Dallas. The Houston and Texas Central Railroad arrived on 16 July 1872 and the Texas and Pacific Railway arrived on 22 February 1873. On 9 September 1882, the area was incorporated into a city called \\"East Dallas\\" (though many thought it should be called \\"Gaston\\") on a tract of 1,400 acres (5,670,000 m¬≤). The small town used an aldermanic form of government and in 1883 it passed a tax ordinance to raise money for civic services. In 1883, the first schools in the area were built for 400 white students and 60 black students. In 1886, the first all- brick schoolhouse in Dallas County was constructed in East Dallas. This school was also the East Dallas City Hall. Until 1900, when the City of Dallas annexed East Dallas, the ground floor held the municipal offices, and the upper floors housed the school. In 1922, Baylor Hospital acquired the building. Fair grounds were originally located near what is now I-45 and Pacific Avenue. They were relocated to the area of Gaston and Hall Street in 1872. In 1887, the State Fair of Texas and Dallas Exposition at Fair Park opened, giving the area further growth. This third location is where the Fair still occurs. By the late 1880s, East Dallas had 6,000 residents and by 1889, 90% of the homes in the city had running water. In 1889, Texas state senator R.S. Kimbrough tried to get a bill run through the state legislature to remove East Dallas' charter so it could be annexed into Dallas. It is generally believed that the act was to make Dallas the largest city in Texas; and the efforts in fact did make Dallas the largest city in Texas by the 1890 census. On 31 December 1889, the day before East Dallas became part of Dallas, East Dallas' city council passed $45,000 in street improvements which the city of Dallas had to finance. Under the newly adopted charter, the city of Dallas took in all of East Dallas' debt.

During the day, it runs a directional 5,000 watts and 500 watts directional at night. The station has a construction permit with the FCC to broadcast with 950 watts daytime and 320 watts nighttime; a two-tower directional antenna array would be used. This information was found on the FCC link on May 31, 2019. History The station at 1480 AM signed on the air on June 10, 1958 as a daytime-only Country music station called KHAT. This format stayed in place until 1972, when it went all-news as KPHX, which only lasted about a year. The format and callsign changes accompanied a 1972 sale to Phoenix Broadcasting Co. This period saw additional changes, including a power increase from 500 to 1,000 watts. Around 1974, with its sale to the Riverside Amusement Park Company, KPHX became a Spanish language station and remained one for approximately 30 years. By 1982, KPHX had started operating at night, using two transmitter sites to provide the daytime and nighttime service. Starting in 2004, KPHX aired a syndicated all-comedy format which remained for nearly two years. KPHX flipped to an adult standards format in 2006, with the Music of Your Life network. Progressive talk format After KXXT (1010 kHz AM), the Phoenix affiliate of Air America Radio since the fall of 2004, was sold to a station group known as Communicom in January 2006, and as a result changed to a Christian radio format by March 2006, the progressive format disappeared from the Phoenix radio airwaves. In late March 2006, the owners of KPHX entered into a local marketing agreement with Sheldon Drobny's Nova M Radio thus bringing the Air America progressive/liberal talk format to KPHX. 1480 KPHX Nova M logo used from 2007 - January 1, 2009 The Lounge Sound 1480 KPHX The Lounge Sound logo used from January 1, 2009 - July 6, 2009 On January 1, 2009, KPHX switched to an Adult standards format as \\"The Lounge Sound\\". Brad \\"Martini\\" Chambers, the man behind KPHX's new format, succeeded in getting the format back on the air after being \\"exiled\\" from the Fabulous 690 in Los Angeles for more than 2 years. Chambers, who had the morning show, \\"Martini In The Morning,\\" continued The Lounge Sound format on the internet from his studios in Studio City, California martiniinthemorning.com. Return to Progressive Talk On July 6, 2009, KPHX discontinued the Lounge Sound and switched back to the progressive talk format. Mike Newcomb hosted an afternoon drive program; the nationally broadcast programs of Randi Rhodes, Thom Hartmann, Bill Press, Stephanie Miller, Mike Malloy and Ed Schultz also returned to the KPHX lineup. KPHX also began carrying the Alan Colmes show, and also the independently syndicated news program Democracy Now! (heard mainly on Pacifica Radio stations among others) on a tape delay basis. Several times per day, national news updates from Westwood One are heard at the top of the hour. Rhodes' and Schultz's radio shows both ceased in the spring of 2014. As of fall 2015, Bill Press, Thom Hartmann, Stephanie Miller and Alan Colmes remain on the schedule from this group of hosts. In January 2016, a locally produced progressive call-in talk show made its debut, hosted by progressive commentator Sam Kelley. Kelley's program aired weekday afternoons, replacing the Jim Rome sports talk show on the schedule. This was the first locally produced afternoon drive program on the station since Mike Newcomb's program ended in 2014. On June 15, 2016, a new afternoon drive-time show debuted from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM. \\"Daily Voice\\" with long time station personality and former producer for the Mike Newcomb show, Eric Reinert. Eric was also a co- host on \\"Team America\\" which also aired on KPHX briefly. Daily Voice is produced by Kathleen Osborn who is also on the show as Eric's cohost. Addition of CBS Sports Radio In the fall of 2014, KPHX added selected weekday/weeknight programming from the recently established CBS Sports Radio network. The Jim Rome Show, The Doug Gottlieb Show and the Amy Lawrence overnight show are on the schedule. KPHX dropped Rome's and Gottlieb's shows on December 11, 2015, in favor of political shows, while Lawrence's show remains on the schedule to fill overnight hours. All remaining CBS Sports Radio programs left KPHX when a new sports talk outlet, KQFN, began broadcasting in February 2017. Some locally produced sports talk programming had been on the station on weekends since 2012. On July 1, 2017 KPHX stopped broadcasting; the station's website stated that \\"KPHX 1480 is no longer broadcasting progressive talk in Phoenix...Thank you for listening\\". It has gone silent because the AMC-8 satellite that supplied its programming was taken out of service at midnight on June 30, 2017. AMC-8 has been replaced by AMC-18, which is at a different location in the sky, requiring repointing the station's dish.

The AZCR runs from Drake to Clarkdale, Arizona. An excursion train also runs on the line through Verde Canyon and is operated by the same owners under the Verde Canyon Railroad. The AZCR is owned by David L. Durbano. Traffic The AZCR handles 1,500 cars per year of inbound coal to the Phoenix Cement Company and shipping outbound cement. The Verde Canyon Railroad carries 100,000 passengers per year (2013 figure). History Verde Valley Railway From 1913 to 1989 the line was operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (Santa Fe Railway). On November 17, 1911, the Verde Valley Railway was chartered as a non-operating subsidiary of the Santa Fe Railway. Construction from Cedar Glade (west of Drake) to Clarkdale was immediately commenced on February 13, 1912, and was completed on February 1, 1913, at a total cost of $1,286,061. It was built to support the copper mines at Jerome, Arizona. On December 31, 1942, the Verde Valley was conveyed to the Santa Fe Railway by deed. On April 14, 1989, the Santa Fe Railway sold the Clarkdale branch to David L. Durbano. The new railroads were named the Clarkdale Arizona Central Railroad for freight and the Verde Canyon Railroad for passenger service. Passenger service resumed in November 1990. Motive power The AZCR has seven locomotives that were all built by originally by EMD. The railroad has one EMD GP7 (AZCR 2164), two EMD GP9 (AZCR 3413) (AZCR 2279), a pair of former ICG Paducah-rebuild GP26's (2601 and 2602) recently acquired from the Cimarron Valley Railroad (2019), and a pair of EMD FP7s (1510 and 1512, used to power the excursion). The vintage FP7 diesel locomotives are two of only ten remaining in operation in North America. They were originally built for the Alaska Railroad in 1953 by the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors in LaGrange, Illinois.

The INAH-3 is significantly larger in males than in females regardless of age and larger in heterosexual males than in homosexual males and heterosexual females. Homologues of the INAH-3 have been observed taking a direct role in sexual behavior in rhesus monkeys, sheep, and rats. Research The term INAH (interstitial nuclei of the anterior hypothalamus), first proposed in 1989 by a group of the University of California at Los Angeles, refers to 4 previously undescribed cell groups of the preoptic-anterior hypothalamic area (PO-AHA) of the human brain, which is a structure that influences gonadotropin secretion, maternal behaviour, and sexual behavior in several mammalian species. There are four nuclei in the PO-AHA (INAH1-4). One of these nuclei, INAH-3, was found to be 2.8 times larger in the male brain than in the female brain regardless of age. A study authored by Simon LeVay and published in the journal Science suggests that the region is an important biological substrate with regard to sexual orientation. This article reported the INAH-3 to be smaller on average in homosexual men than in heterosexual men, and in fact has approximately the same size in homosexual men as in heterosexual women.\\"Central Nervous System Dimorphisms Related to Reproductive Behaviors\\" Dale Purves ed., Neuroscience, 2:ed (2001) Online https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=neurosci.section.2127 Further research has found that the INAH3 is smaller in volume in homosexual men than in heterosexual men because homosexual men have a higher neuronal packing density (the number of neurons per cubic millimeter) in the INAH3 than heterosexual men; there is no difference in the number or cross-sectional area of neurons in the INAH3 of homosexual versus heterosexual men. It has also been found that there is no effect of HIV infection on the size of INAH3, that is, HIV infection cannot account for the observed difference in INAH3 volume between homosexual and heterosexual men. LeVay noted three possibilities that could account for his findings: 1. The structural differences in INAH3 between homosexual and heterosexual males were present prenatally or in early life and aided in establishment of the men‚Äôs sexual orientation; 2. The differences appeared postnatally as a result of the men‚Äôs sexual feelings or behavior and; 3. Both the differences in INAH3 and sexual orientation are linked to some third confounding variable (such as a developmental event in prenatal or early life). LeVay found the first possibility most probable and noted that the second possibility was unlikely in light of various homologous studies in other species. It has been proven that in rats, the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA) appears during the perinatal sensitive period as a consequence of the dependence of its constituent neurons on circulating androgen, thus offering indirect support for the first possibility. After this period, even extreme interventions, such as castration, have little effect on the size of the nucleus, which would help contradict the second possibility of behavior changing brain structure. It has been suggested that the human INAH-3 is the homologue of the rat‚Äôs SDN-POA. Other researchers have studied correlations between INAH-3 volume and other aspects of sexual identity. A study of transgender individuals by neuroanatomist Dick Swaab found male-to- female transgender people to have a size and number of neurons of INAH-3 closer to a normal female range, and that female-to-male transgender people have a size and number of INAH-3 neurons closer to a normal male range. This finding that the size of the INAH-3 more closely corresponded to the gender the subject identified with rather than their biological or chromosomal gender has since been repeated, but is still controversial due to potential confounds of hormone replacement therapy.

The facility was made famous by its reputation for its extremely difficult problems. Many notable international rock climbers were trained at The School Room, including Ben Moon, Malcolm Smith, Jerry Moffatt and Richard Simpson. The School Room received its name from the fact that its original location, in the Heeley Bank School community centre, formed a portion of an old school building. Another portion of the building was used for an art studio. The facility consisted of four plywood climbing walls, which are covered with wooden and plastic holds, at angles of between 15 and 52 degrees. In 2006, the School Room was under threat of closure and Sheffield City Council had asked all users of the centre to vacate the premises .

Specifically, the body is free to change position as forward/backward (surge), up/down (heave), left/right (sway) translation in three perpendicular axes, combined with changes in orientation through rotation about three perpendicular axes, often termed yaw (normal axis), pitch (transverse axis), and roll (longitudinal axis). Three degrees of freedom (3DOF), a term often used in the context of virtual reality, refers to tracking of rotational motion only: pitch, yaw, and roll. Robotics Serial and parallel manipulator systems are generally designed to position an end-effector with six degrees of freedom, consisting of three in translation and three in orientation. This provides a direct relationship between actuator positions and the configuration of the manipulator defined by its forward and inverse kinematics. Robot arms are described by their degrees of freedom. This number typically refers to the number of single-axis rotational joints in the arm, where higher number indicates an increased flexibility in positioning a tool. This is a practical metric, in contrast to the abstract definition of degrees of freedom which measures the aggregate positioning capability of a system.Paul, Richard P., Robot Manipulators: Mathematics, Programming, and Control, MIT Press, 1981. In 2007, Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway, unveiled a prototype robotic arm with 14 degrees of freedom for DARPA. Humanoid robots typically have 30 or more degrees of freedom, with six degrees of freedom per arm, five or six in each leg, and several more in torso and neck.Craig, John J., Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control, Addison-Wesley, 1986. Engineering The term is important in mechanical systems, especially biomechanical systems for analyzing and measuring properties of these types of systems that need to account for all six degrees of freedom. Measurement of the six degrees of freedom is accomplished today through both AC and DC magnetic or electromagnetic fields in sensors that transmit positional and angular data to a processing unit. The data is made relevant through software that integrates the data based on the needs and programming of the users. An example of six degree of freedom movement is the motion of a ship at sea. It is described as:Summary of ship movement Translational envelopes : #Moving forward and backward on the X-axis. (Surge) #Moving left and right on the Y-axis. (Sway) #Moving up and down on the Z-axis. (Heave) Rotational envelopes : #Tilting side to side on the X-axis. (Roll) #Tilting forward and backward on the Y-axis. (Pitch) #Turning left and right on the Z-axis. (Yaw)  Operational envelope types  There are three types of operational envelope in the Six degrees of freedom. These types are Direct, Semi-direct (conditional) and Non- direct, all regardless of the time remaining for the execution of the maneuver, the energy remaining to execute the maneuver and finally, if the motion is commanded via a biological entity (e.g. human), a robotical entity (e.g. computer) or both. #Direct type: Involved a degree can be commanded directly without particularly conditions and described as a normal operation. (An aileron on a basic airplane) #Semi-direct type: Involved a degree can be commanded when some specific conditions are met. (Reverse thrust on an aircraft) #Non-direct type: Involved a degree when is achieved via the interaction with its environment and cannot be commanded. (Pitching motion of a vessel at sea) Transitional type also exists in some vehicles. For example, when the Space Shuttle operates in space, the craft is described as fully- direct-six because its six degrees can be commanded. However, when the Space Shuttle is in the earth's atmosphere for its return, the fully-direct-six degrees are no longer applicable for many technical reasons. Game controllers Six degrees of freedom also refers to movement in video game- play. First-person shooter (FPS) games generally provide five degrees of freedom: forwards/backwards, slide left/right, up/down (jump/crouch/lie), yaw (turn left/right), and pitch (look up/down). If the game allows leaning control, then some consider it a sixth DoF; however, this may not be completely accurate, as a lean is a limited partial rotation. The term 6DoF has sometimes been used to describe games which allow freedom of movement, but do not necessarily meet the full 6DoF criteria. For example, Dead Space 2, and to a lesser extent, Homeworld and Zone Of The Enders allow freedom of movement. Some examples of true 6DoF games, which allow independent control of all three movement axes and all three rotational axes, include Elite Dangerous, Shattered Horizon, the Descent franchise, Retrovirus, Miner Wars, Space Engineers, Forsaken and Overload (from the same creators of Descent). The space MMO Vendetta Online also features 6 degrees of freedom. Motion tracking devices such as TrackIR are used for 6DoF head tracking. This device often finds its places in flight simulators and other vehicle simulators that require looking around the cockpit to locate enemies or simply avoiding accidents in-game. The acronym 3DoF, meaning movement in the three dimensions but not rotation, is sometimes encountered. The Razer Hydra, a motion controller for PC, tracks position and rotation of two wired nunchucks, providing six degrees of freedom on each hand. The SpaceOrb 360 is a 6DOF computer input device released in 1996 originally manufactured and sold by the SpaceTec IMC company (first bought by Labtec, which itself was later bought by Logitech). The controllers sold with HTC VIVE provide 6DOF information by the lighthouse, which adopts Time of Flight (TOF) technology to determine the position of controllers.

Dasht River south of the Central Makran Range in Kech District in Balochistan province of Pakistan. Its reservoir is fed by the Kech River and the Nihing River. Mirani Dam was completed in July 2006 and began impounding the Dasht River in August 2006. History and construction The feasibility report of the Mirani dam project was first completed in 1956. The project then went into the back screen due to the other major events of the time. 45 years passed like that and then in the wake of Gwadar Port development Mirani Dam was commissioned by Pakistan's Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) in 2001 to provide water for Gwadar city. The ceremonial ground breaking was performed by then President of Pakistan, General Pervez Musharraf, in August 2001. The project was done on EPC basis by Descon Engineering Limited. Commencement of work began in June 2002 and the project was completed in June 2007. Impounding of reservoir started in July 2006 and was inaugurated by then President of Pakistan Gen. Pervez Musharraf on 16 November 2006. Construction of t-hours and, at its peak, 1,550 people were employed for its construction, mostly from Kech and Gwadar districts. of land was acquired for the project. During Cyclone Yemyin in June 2007, backflowing water from Mirani Dam in the Nihing and Kech rivers resulted in a large-scale disaster, affected several thousand households in the upstream areas of Nasirabad, Kallatuk, and Nodiz. Geography and hydrology Mirani Dam is located on Dasht River, approximately west of Turbat and south west of Quetta, in Makran Division of Balochistan. The Central Makran Range are located to the north of the dam site. The dam is located downstream of the confluence of the two tributaries of Dasht; Kech River and Nihing River at Kaur-e-Awaran. Both Kech and Nihing are seasonal streams which flow during summer from rainfall and melting snow from the mountains upstream. Structure and purpose Kech Valley consists of cultivable soil upon which agriculture activity could be carried out if a constant water supply is ensured. The primary purpose of Mirani Dam was to store water from the three rivers during the summer season and during floods so that water could be available for irrigation purposes throughout the year in order to bring of hitherto uncultivated land in Kech Valley under cultivation. The secondary purpose of Mirani Dam is to ensure a constant supply of clean drinking water to the towns of Turbat and Gwadar throughout the year.

The local communities have staged protests, hunger-strikes, and people's tribunal to demand compensation in lieu of damages from the government authorities. Mirani Dam Flooding On the night between June 26 & 27, 2007 the backflow water from Mirani dam inundated upstream areas of Nasirabad, Nodez, and Kallatuk destroying several thousand houses, date trees, and indigenous underground irrigation channels. The damage was so extensive that the current Chief Minister of Baluchistan province, Dr. Abdul Malik Baloch who was a Senator at the time, termed the Dam as a \\"mega-disaster\\" and calling into question all the government assessments and forecasts about its utility. Local activists have been since then demanding the relevant authorities including WAPDA, the Planning Commission of Pakistan, and the Provincial government to pay compensation for their losses. Their specific demands include compensation of damages to houses and date trees for up to 271.2 Average Mean Sea Level (AMSL),. While the government has acknowledged the claim by local communities 8 years after the disaster, the compensation is yet to be paid.

He is considered to have been one of the best goalkeepers of his era. Early life Beara was born in an ethnic Serb family to parents Jakov and Marija in the village of Zelovo Sutinsko near Sinj in present-day Croatia. He had two brothers named Ljubo and Sveto. According to Split-based journalist Zdravko Reiƒá, Beara declared himself as a Croat in the state censuses. Club career For Hajduk Split (1946‚Äì55) Beara played 308 games, and helped his team to win the Yugoslav League title in 1950, 1952 and 1955. He made, however, a transfer in 1955 to Belgrade's Red Star (1955‚Äì60), after the season he had won the third league title. With Red Star he won even more Yugoslav league titles, in 1956, 1957, 1959, 1960, and won the Yugoslav Cup in 1958 and 1959. He was Red Star's goalkeeper against Manchester United in the last game United had played before the Munich Air Disaster. In 1963, the great Soviet goalkeeper, Lev Yashin said that not him, but Vladimir Beara is the greatest keeper of all time. Beara ended his career in German clubs Alemannia Aachen (1960‚Äì62) and Viktoria K√∂ln (1963‚Äì64). International career Beara played 59 games for the Yugoslav national team between 1950 and 1960. Immediately after being selected to play for the Yugoslav national team, he became famous mostly due to his fabulous stops in a match against England at Highbury Stadium of Arsenal. Since then he was often called by his nickname Vladimir Veliki. Beara participated in the 1952 Summer Olympic Games; he was a member of the team that reached the final against Hungary, winning a silver medal, and also saving a Ferenc Pusk√°s penalty. He also represented his nation in three World Cups; World Cup 1950, World Cup 1954 and World Cup 1958. In 1953, Beara was one of four Yugoslav players on the FIFA World-Stars XI who played an exhibition game against England; the match finished in a 4‚Äì4 draw, with Beara conceding only one goal. Coaching career In 1967 Beara finished a coaching course at the sports academy at the German Sport University Cologne, today's Hennes Weisweiler Academy. He went on to coach clubs in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Yugoslavia as well as the national team of Cameroon. A highlight of his coaching career was winning the Yugoslav national championship with Hajduk Split in 1971 as assistant coach to Slavko Lu≈°tica. This was the club's first championship since his departure as player in 1955. He also won the African Cup Winners' Cup with Tonnerre Yaound√© in 1975. Death On 11 August 2014, Beara's family announced that he died in Split, Croatia after several strokes over the previous year. He was buried in the Catholic Lovrinac Cemetery. The decision made by Beara's widow Jadranka to bury him at a Catholic cemetery was met with criticism, because Beara was a staunch believer of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Style of play Beara was an athletic and self-confident keeper, endowed with an eye-catching yet effective style. Thanks to his firm grip on the ball and his brave attitude, not only he was an outstanding shot-stopper, but he also excelled at coming off his line. He was nicknamed The ballet dancer with the hands of steel because of his ability to combine elegance with goalkeeping skills.

The anchor stores are JCPenney, Shoe Carnival, Barnes & Noble, Planet Fitness, Sears, Flix Brewhouse, and Dick's Sporting Goods. There are 2 vacant anchor stores that were once Gordmans and Boston Store. History The mall opened for business October 14, 1971 with a small ribbon cutting ceremony, a year after West Towne Mall, on the east side of Madison. At the time it was constructed, East Towne was Madison's largest enclosed mall, and had four large anchor stores, Sears, J. C. Penney, H. C. Prange Co., and Gimbel's.Wisconsin State Journal. East Towne Supplement. Wednesday, October 13, 1971. Prange Way also took up a section at the back of Pranges' space. The mall was developed by Jacobs, Visconsi, and Jacobs Company of Cleveland, Ohio. Construction began September 18, 1970. Originally, the mall contained eight water pools and sunken lounge areas. Artists Clarence Van Duzer and Joseph McDonnell were commissioned to create art work for the mall. McDonnell created four sculptures, including a 3,000 pound metal yellow rhinoceros with red polka dots made of half-inch steel plates. Another was a 35'x22' chandelier- like work suspended above one of the entryways. The chandelier was multi- colored and according to McDonnell, was inspired by a game of pick-up sticks and designed to resemble \\"a galaxy of light\\" from outside the center. Van Duzen was responsible for the large central area with its ceiling and four contemporary pillars. In the center was a large three-level pool with waterfalls, a fountain, and flashing lights, all synchronized to music. The main entrance was flanked by sculpted stone blocks in relief with irregular shapes and sizes. All the water sculptures and sunken lounge areas were removed in the late 1980s and the main entrance was redesigned, with the addition of a food court. The parking area was designed by Stone and Robinson Associates, Inc., originally with a capacity of 6,000 cars and an average, maximum car-to-store distance of As a result of expansion of the main facility and construction projects on its perimeter, the parking area has since been reduced in size to hold fewer than 5,000 cars. East Towne Mall was constructed near the intersection of U.S. Route 151 and Interstate 90/94, but was virtually alone when built on over of farmland. Now it rests in the center of a large retail area with a number of banks, restaurants and numerous chain big-box stores ranging from Best Buy and Shopko and The Home Depot Original logo of East Towne Mall. Gimbel's became Boston Store in 1987 upon Gimbels' collapse a year earlier. Prange's became Younkers upon the buyout of the chain in 1992. Before the buyout, Prange Way closed, allowing Younker's to expand into the large section the discount store had originally taken. Younker's was renamed the Boston Store at this mall, as well as the West Towne Mall and Regency Mall's locations in 2003 when then-owners Saks Inc. consolidated all southern Wisconsin stores into one banner. Once the consolidation was complete, the Boston Store which occupied the former Gimbel's location was closed. The original Gimbel's structure was razed and is now a Dick's Sporting Goods, Gordmans which opened in September 2004 and new mall space.Gordmans making a splash at East Towne.

From the mall's opening until around 2003, the mall also had a six-screen movie theater, which from the middle of the 1980s to about 2003 was called Budget Cinemas and owned by Silver Cinemas. It closed in 2003 because Budget Cinemas Mall Wing Entrance and other stores near the entrance were bought by Steve & Barry's, with the mall entrance turned into the entrance for Steve & Barry's. Steve & Barry's closed in December 2008, and was a Steinhafels, a local furniture chain, but now is a Flix Brewhouse.

The original name of the town as per records was Kridapura. His life was one of love and dedication to art. His career began when Nripa Haya ruled as a local chieftain of the area.

Krishna in relief at the entrance of Channakeshava Temple, Kaidala  Jakanachari and his son  Jakanachari's wife gave birth to his child, named Dankanacharya. Dankanacharya himself grew up to become a famous sculptor and set out to find his father. At Belur, he found a job as a sculptor and noticed a flaw in a figure sculpted by the great Jakanacharya himself. Dankanacharya told Jakanacharya that the stone which he was carving had a toad living inside which was a considered to be a flaw by the sculptors. Furious at this, Jakanacharya challenged to cut off his right hand if the young sculptor was correct in his assessment of the sculpture. Dankanacharya chiselled the place where the flaw was present and a toad jumped out with a little water flowing from that spot. Upon testing the figure, the flaw was indeed revealed and Jakanacharya kept his promise and cut off his right hand. Eventually, the two sculptors become aware of their relationship as father and son.

The veteran cinematographer BS Ranga was instrumental in the making of this movie, the first Kannada colour movie. Also in 1964, a Telugu remake of the movie titled Amara Silpi Jakkanna starring Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Saroja Devi was released to popular success.

It tells of a cat called Ribby and a tea party she holds for a dog called Duchess. Complications arise when Duchess tries to replace Ribby's mouse pie with her own veal and ham pie, and then believes she has swallowed a small tin pastry form called a patty-pan. Its themes are etiquette and social relations in a small town. A version of the tale was composed by Potter in 1903, but set aside to develop other projects. In 1904, she failed to complete a book of nursery rhymes for Warnes, and the 1903 tale was accepted in its stead. Potter elaborated its setting and storyline, and developed the tale more fully before publication. The illustrations depict the cottages and gardens of Sawrey, a village in the Lake District near Potter's Hill Top farm, and have been described as some of the most exquisite Potter ever produced. Ribby was modelled on a cat living in Sawrey, Duchess on two Pomeranians belonging to Potter's neighbour Mrs Rogerson, Tabitha Twitchit on Potter's cat at Hill Top, and Dr Maggoty on the magpies in the London Zoological Gardens. The tale was originally published in a larger size than Potter's previous books, but was reduced in the 1930s to bring it into line with the other books in the Peter Rabbit series. It was given its present title at that time. Potter declared the tale her next favourite to The Tailor of Gloucester. Beswick Pottery released porcelain figurines of the tale's characters through the latter half of the 20th century, and Schmid & Co. released a music box in the 1980s.  Development and publication  The stolid-looking house at Hill Top, the grazing cows, and the cat \\"impart a sense of settled respectability\\" in the frontispiece.Hobbs 1989, p. 157 The Potter family summered occasionally at Lakefield, a country house in the village of Sawrey. \\"They came with their servants, their carriage and pair, and Miss Potter with her pony and phaeton,\\" a village resident recalled. \\"Miss Potter was about the village sketching everywhere and often came to our house.\\"Linder 1971, p. 168 Close to Lakefield and off the road in their own enclosure were three dwellings known as Lakefield Cottages. Mr. Rogerson, a gardener and caretaker at Lakefield, lived in one of the cottages, and eventually his wife's two pedigree Pomeranians ‚Äì Darkie and Duchess ‚Äì would become the models for Potter's fictional Duchess. Darkie had a fine black mane, but Duchess was more intelligent and could sit up with a lump of sugar balanced on her nose. In the summer of 1902, Potter sketched the interior of the third Lakefield Cottage belonging to a Mrs. Lord. These drawings included a watercolour and pen-and-ink sketches of the living-room, pen-and-ink sketches of the pots of geraniums on the living-room window sill, the entrance passage, the pantry, the stairs, some of the upstairs rooms, and details of the carved oak furniture. In some of the sketches Potter roughly outlined a cat. She also sketched the village including the sloping path down to the Lakefield Cottages and the post office door. These became the backgrounds for The Pie and The Patty-Pan. During a rainy holiday in Hastings at the end of November 1903, Potter outlined a tale about a cat, a dog, and a tea party she called Something very very NICE. She discussed the Lakefield sketches as backgrounds for the tale with Warne. He proposed a large format volume similar to L. Leslie Brooke's Johnny Crow's Garden to do justice to the detail of the illustrations, but the entire project was set aside when The Tale of Benjamin Bunny and The Tale of Two Bad Mice were chosen for development and publication in 1904.Taylor 1987, pp. 123‚Äì4 Potter had long wanted to develop a book of nursery rhymes, but such a project left Warne cold. Rhymes were already well represented in the firm's catalogue, and Warne felt Potter's unbridled enthusiasm for the genre would make the project a headache for him. In the past, he had tried to discourage Potter's interest in rhymes, believing her own stories superior, but she persisted. He reluctantly agreed to a book of rhymes for 1905, but Potter did not have it ready at the end of 1904, so he accepted the tea party tale instead.Lear 2007, pp. 186,191 Early in 1905, it was decided the book would be published at the end of the year. Cupboard Love by Briton Riviere depicts Potter's cousin Kate. The work was parodied by Potter in the illustration of Duchess searching Ribby's cupboard for the mouse pie.Hobbs 1989, p. 160 By March 1905, Potter was anxious to begin work on the tale. She thought the 1903 version too thin and rewrote the entire story, retaining Ribby the cat and Duchess the dog as the central characters while elaborating the setting and developing a stronger plot line. It was decided the tale would be published in a format slightly larger than her previous productions with ten full-colour illustrations and other illustrations in pen and sepia ink.Lear 2007, p. 193 Like the tale's companion piece set in the Newlands Valley, The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the cat and dog story is set in a real place, Near Sawrey, and is the only Potter tale to refer to Sawrey by name. Tabitha Twitchit disdainfully comments on her cousin's choice of party guest: \\"A little dog, indeed! Just as if there were no CATS in Sawrey!\\"Lane 2001, p. 100 The characters in the tale were modelled on real world individuals. Ribby's counterpart lived in Sawrey, and Tabitha Twitchit's counterpart lived at Hill Top, though her fictional shop is located in nearby Hawkshead.Taylor 1987, p. 124 Dr. Maggotty was drawn from magpies in the London Zoological Gardens. Potter made notes in her sketchbook about the bird's anatomical structure and the colour of its feathers: \\"Brown black eye, nose a little hookier than jackdaw, less feathered.\\" The bird's tail was over half its total length she noted, and its feathers were \\"very blue\\" and parts were green. Duchess searches for the mouse pie The illustrations depict the village's gardens, cottages, and, in the background of the frontispiece, Hill Top.Linder 1971, p. 169Lear 2007, pp. 193‚Äì4 Although the real Duchess lived at Lakefield Cottages, in the tale her home became Buckle Yeat, a picturesque cottage in the village, and Duchess is shown in its garden reading Ribby's invitation. In the illustration of Duchess leaving home with her veal and ham pie in a basket, Potter took some artistic licence and combined the doorway of the village post office with the Buckle Yeat garden. Completely faithful to life in the village, Potter even included the pattens Mrs. Rogerson wore to the pump in the illustration depicting Duchess standing in the Lakefield Cottage porch holding a bouquet. The illustration of Duchess standing on a red sofa cushion was painted at Melford Hall and Potter's young cousin Stephanie Hyde Parker was permitted to put some red paint on the cushion. She later wondered if Potter removed it. Towards the end of May 1905, Potter sent the illustrations to Warne for his review, writing, \\"I think it promises to make a pretty book.\\"Linder 1971, p. 170 He criticised a picture of the cat and Potter wrote him, \\"If you still feel doubtful about the little cat‚Äîwill you post it back to me at once ... I don't feel perfectly satisfied with the eyes of the large head, but I think I can get it right, by taking out the lights carefully, if you will ask Hentschel not to do it before we have proofs. The drawing is getting much too rubbed.\\" On 25 May, Warne asked Potter to send him one of the two dummy books she had in her possession in order to check the size of the plates before continuing with the printer's blocks. He thought there was \\"too much bend\\" about the dog's nose and the division between its legs was unclear. He kept the two plates back for Potter's inspection before sending them off to make the blocks. On 26 May, he received two more originals and the circular portrait of the cat for the cover. He thought the background of the colour illustration of Ribby and Duchess sitting at the table too light, but liked the pen-and-ink sketches. Potter struggled with the dog illustrations,Lear 2007, pp. 184‚Äì5 and sent Warne a photograph of her canine model to prove the dog's ruff was as large as she had depicted it. Main street of Sawrey photographed by Potter's father in May 1913 One of the illustrations did not coordinate properly with Potter's text. She altered the drawing and wrote Warne, \\"I have altered the oven as it will save a good many corrections. I did a good deal to the cat but she is still looking at the top one. I don't think it signifies as she talks about both ovens ... I don't think I have ever seriously considered the state of the pie but the book runs some risk of being over cooked if it goes on much longer! I am sorry about the little dog's nose. I saw it was too sharp. I think I have got it right. I was intending to explain the ovens by saying the middle handle is very stiff so that Duchess concludes it is a sham;‚Äìlike the lowest. I think only two pages want changing; I think it will come right.\\" The drawings were finished and in early June 1905 Warne approved. Potter wrote she was glad he liked the drawings, and \\"if the book prints well, it will be my next favourite to Tailor. She was energized with the completion of the book and wrote Warne she wanted to settle on future work before leaving for a holiday in Wales. In Merioneth she received his letter of proposal on 25 July and accepted, but he died suddenly and unexpectedly on 25 August 1905 before a marriage took place.Linder 1971, p. 171 Potter became deeply depressed and was ill for many weeks.Lane 1978, p. 140 However, she rallied to complete the last two tales she had discussed with him: The Pie and the Patty-Pan and The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher.Lear 2007, p. 206 The Pie and the Patty-Pan was published in October 1905 in a large format, priced at one shilling,Lane 1978, p. 142 and dedicated to Joan, the sixth child of Potter's former governess Annie Carter Moore, and to Beatrix, Mrs. Moore's newborn and Potter's god-daughter: \\"For Joan, to read to Baby\\".Taylor 1996, p. 100 The Pie was the first of Potter's books to be published in a format larger (177 mm by 138 mm) than the standard size (139 mm by 104 mm) of the Peter Rabbit books; and the first of her books to integrate pen-and-ink and colour illustrations between its boards.Kutzer 2003, p. 82 The book's endpapers had been overlooked. Potter wrote to the firm: \\"I conclude there is no time to get an end-paper design done‚Äîunless Mr. Stokoe has already designed one‚ÄîI do not mind one way or another; I had begun to scribble something but it looks a bit stiff.\\" Mr. Stokoe apparently did not design one because the endpapers were either plain white or mottled lavender. Several years later, they were replaced with a design featuring a pie and a patty-pan and the cover illustration changed to Ribby sitting by the fire. In the 1930s, the book's size was reduced to bring it into line with the rest of the Peter Rabbit books. The title was changed at that time to The Tale of the Pie and the Patty-Pan.Linder 1971, p. 172  Plot  Potter declared the tale her next favorite to The Tailor of Gloucester. The pictures are some of the most beautiful Potter ever created, especially the profusions of flowers in the doorways and garden plots. The colors in the illustrations are not the muted browns and greens the reader expects in a Potter illustration, nor are they the contrasting colors such as the muted reds and blues Potter uses occasionally to give her illustrations a splash of color. Instead, the colors are bright oranges, violets, and yellows seldom seen in her other books. Even Ribby's lilac dress and Duchess's black mane illustrate Potter's concern for color in this book.MacDonald 1986, pp. 95‚Äì6 Potter's own three-door oven, her hearthrug, her indoor plants, her coronation teapot, and her water pump are minutely detailed with more color than in other productions. The large format of the original edition, the captions accompanying the full page color illustrations, and the occasional lack of coordination between picture and text all display Potter's delight in the pictures, sometimes at the expense of the text. \\"Once upon a time\\", Ribby, a \\"Pussy-cat\\" invites a little dog called Duchess to tea with plans to serve her \\"something so very very nice\\" baked in a pie dish with a pink rim. Ribby promises Duchess she shall have the entree entirely to herself. Duchess accepts the invitation but hopes she will not be served mouse. \\"I really couldn't, couldn't eat mouse pie. And I shall have to eat it, because it is a party.\\" Duchess has prepared a ham and veal pie in a pink-rimmed dish (just like Ribby's dish), and would much rather eat her own pie. \\"It is all ready to put into the oven,\\" she says, \\"Such a lovely pie- crust; and I put in a little tin patty-pan to hold up the crust.\\" She reads the invitation again and realizes she will have the opportunity to switch the pies when Ribby leaves on an errand. Ribby has two ovens, one above the other, and she puts her mouse pie in the lower oven. She tidies the house, sets the table, and leaves to buy tea, marmalade, and sugar. Duchess meantime has left home with her ham and veal pie in a basket, passes Ribby on the street, and hurries on to Ribby's house. She puts her pie into the upper oven, and searches quickly for the mouse pie (which she does not find because she neglects to look in the lower oven). She slips out the back door as Ribby returns. At the appointed hour, Duchess appears at Ribby's door and the party begins. Distracted for a moment, Duchess does not see which oven Ribby opens to remove the pie. Duchess eats greedily, believing she is eating her ham and veal pie. She wonders what has happened to the patty-pan she put in her pie, and, not finding it under the crust, is convinced she has swallowed it. She sets up a howl; Ribby is perplexed and annoyed but leaves to find Dr. Maggoty, a magpie. Duchess is left alone before Ribby's fire, and discovers her ham and veal pie in the oven. \\"Then I must have been eating MOUSE! ... No wonder I feel ill,\\" she muses. Knowing she cannot adequately explain her ham and veal pie to Ribby, she puts it outside the back door intending to sneak back and carry it home after she leaves for home. Ribby and Dr. Maggoty arrive and, after much fuss, Duchess takes her leave, only to find that the magpie (who has left by the back door) and a couple of jackdaws have eaten her ham and veal pie. Ribby later finds the remains of the pie dish and the patty-pan outside the back door and declares, \\"Well I never did! ... Next time I want to give a party ‚Äì I will invite Cousin Tabitha Twitchit!\\"  Scholarly commentaries  M. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh at the time of her Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code (2003) believes The Pie and its two immediate predecessors (the tales of Two Bad Mice and Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle) are transitional works in Potter's life and literary career. All three books confront the meaning of domesticity, work, and social hierarchies while exhibiting an underlying discomfort with the unyielding strictures of Victorian domesticity, and a disengagement from the broad political and social concerns of her earlier books to the more narrow political and social concerns of working farmers and rural people.Kutzer 2003, p. 65 Ruth K. MacDonald of New Mexico State University at the time of her Beatrix Potter (1986) argues that the theme of The Pie is the very proper social relations between neighbours in a small town. She points to the overly formal quality of the letters exchanged between the heroines as one example of the theme, and another, she indicates, is the manner in which the two pass each other on the street without a word to one another because \\"they were going to have a party\\". Though Duchess probably does not speak to Ribby for fear of revealing her plan to switch the two pies, Ribby probably does not speak to Duchess out of an exaggerated sense of politeness or because she is rushed. At the hour of the party, Duchess is anxious to arrive on time, yet not too early, and loiters outside Ribby's cottage before delivering her most \\"genteel little tap-tappity\\" and asking \\"Is Mrs. Ribston at home?\\" MacDonald notes that these instances not only underscore the elaborate codes of behaviour Potter's fictional animals observe but, by extension, the villagers of Sawrey. For Potter, the result of such elaborate etiquette was nonsensical, distorted behaviour. Nevertheless, the cat and dog remain friends at the end of the story, and, in carefully avoiding any offence, their social pretenses and codes of etiquette are maintained.MacDonald 1986, pp. 93‚Äì4  Merchandise  Potter asserted her tales would one day be nursery classics, and part of the process in making them so was marketing strategy.MacDonald 1986, p. 128 She was the first to exploit the commercial possibilities of her characters and tales with spinoffs such as a Peter Rabbit doll, an unpublished Peter Rabbit board game, and a Peter Rabbit nursery wallpaper between 1903 and 1905.Lear 2007, pp. 172‚Äì5 Similar \\"side-shows\\" (as she termed the spinoffs) were conducted over the following two decades.Taylor 1987, p. 106 In 1947, Frederick Warne & Co. gave Beswick Pottery of Longton, Staffordshire rights and licences to produce the Potter characters in porcelain. Ribby coming from the farm with butter and milk was released as a figurine in 1951; Duchess with a bouquet of flowers in 1955; Duchess holding the ham and veal pie in 1979; and Ribby and the broken pie dish in 1992. A limited edition tableau depicting Duchess and Ribby was produced only in 2000.Dubay 2006, pp. 30,36‚Äì7 Schmid & Co. of Toronto and Randolph, Massachusetts was granted licensing rights to Beatrix Potter in 1977. A music box playing \\"Music Box Dancer\\" and topped with a porcelain figure of Duchess holding a bouquet was released in 1980.Dubay 2006, pp. 107‚Äì8  Reprints and translations  As of 2010, all of Potter's 23 small format books remain in print, and available as complete sets in presentation boxes, and as a 400-page omnibus. First edition copies and early reprints of The Pie are offered by antiquarian booksellers. The Pie was available as a hardcover volume but also in paperback, audiobook, and electronic formats. The English language editions of the books still bore the Frederick Warne imprint in 2010 though the company was bought by Penguin Books in 1983. The printing plates for the Potter books were remade from new photographs of the original drawings in 1985, and all 23 volumes released in 1987 as The Original and Authorized Edition.Taylor 1996, p. 216 Potter's books have been translated into nearly thirty languages including Greek and Russian. In 1986, MacDonald observed that the Potter books had become a traditional part of childhood in both English-speaking lands and those in which the books had been translated.MacDonald 1987, p. 130 Notes References      External links  *Peter Rabbit official website Category:1905 children's books Category:Books by Beatrix Potter Category:Books about cats Category:Books about dogs Category:Frederick Warne & Co books Category:Picture books by Beatrix Potter Category:British children's books Category:British picture books ","title":"The Tale of the Pie and the Patty-Pan"},{"id":"4535260","title":"Kolkata International Film Festival"},{"id":"4535271","text":"At either posterior angle of the hard palate is the greater palatine foramen, for the transmission of the descending palatine vessels and greater palatine nerve; and running anteriorly (forward) and medially (towards the center-line) from it is a groove, for the same vessels and nerve.

It is located southwest of the provincial capital of Regina. The population was 286 at the 2011 census. Previous names for Willow Bunch include Hart-Rouge and Talle-de-Saules. The area has seen influences from M√©tis and Fransaskois. History  The M√©tis of Willow Bunch  Around 1824, the M√©tis began to move towards Southern Saskatchewan: \\"As they ventured farther out, they began to set up winter camps and stay year-round. One of the first settlements was at Wood Mountain, which was settled in about 1868-69. But in 1879, fires forced the M√©tis to move to the eastern slope of the hills to a place known as 'Talle de Saule.'\\" The M√©tis settlement in Willow Bunch is one of the first in Saskatchewan. They initially arrived in groups consisting of large extended families; no one journeyed individually. As a result of travelling between communities regularly, the M√©tis began to intermingle, creating relationships with the different groups of settlers. This gave rise to the growth of the settlement in Willow Bunch.Littlejohn, Catherine, Ron Rivard, et al. \\"Metis History for Exhibits and Scripts.\\" Historica Foundation. (2002): 3. Print. The majority of the M√©tis settlers that came to Willow Bunch were partially of First Nations and of French or Scottish descent. At the end of the 1860s, many M√©tis settlers moved towards Wood Mountain, Saskatchewan, from the Red River Colony, Pembina, North Dakota, and other communities in the North West. They came in search of bison.Littlejohn, Catherine, Ron Rivard, et al. \\"Metis History for Exhibits and Scripts.\\" Historica Foundation. (2002): 1-2. Print. Soon after the arrival of the M√©tis, Jean-Louis Legar√© set up a trading post in Willow Bunch, aiding the M√©tis as a trader of bison goods. Nearing the mid-1880s, there was a decline of bison in the Wood Mountain region, as a result of the United States government's attempt to starve out Sitting Bull. With the end of the Bison Hunt, the M√©tis began life as ranchers: \\"We brought our stock and expertise to Willow Bunch. No one knew more about horsemanship and training horses than we did\\". The M√©tis population in Willow Bunch became known as a \\"hub of the first tentative ranching operations in southwestern Saskatchewan.\\" The M√©tis originally referred to the town and its surrounding area as \\"Talle de Saule\\" which means \\"Clump of Willow.\\" This nickname soon gave rise to the town's name of Willow Bunch. The red willows found around Willow Bunch were an important factor in the everyday lives of the M√©tis. The multifaceted willow played a large role in their wellbeing: > In spring, our women harvested the supple, young shoots to make baskets. Our > men fashioned the wood into pipe stems, emergency snowshoes, snares, wooden > nails, whistles for the children, beading looms, and frames for stretching > hides. Rotted willow wood was used to smoke hides. Green willow branches > were burned to smoke meat. We twisted the inner bark fibers into temporary > rope, twine and fish nets. We weather proofed rawhide by wrapping it in > willow bark. We used willow branches as lathing for our houses. Our men > scraped off the inner cambium layer and added other ingredients, such as > bearberry, to make a smoking mixture, 'Kinnikinick'. We repaired our carts, > made a shelter when we were caught in a storm, burned for fuel and had a > variety of other practical uses for the wood of the willow. The M√©tis found use for the willows in a variety of ways, including as a medicinal ingredient. Thus, places where the willows grew were considered a healing place. This is why \\"the people would settle near clumps of willow and name their community accordingly.\\"Cuthand, Doug. \\"Metis played vital role in history: [Final Edition].\\" Leader Post. 16 Feb 2004: B1. Print. M√©tis Hamlet in Willow Bunch, 2013  The M√©tis today  The town of Willow Bunch is occupied with Francophone and M√©tis people. Willow Bunch is the Rural Municipality #42 in southern Saskatchewan. In 2006, the total Aboriginal population for the RM #42 was 407.Statistics Canada. Census of Canada. Town of Willow Bunch. 2006 The M√©tis in Willow Bunch \\"played a key role in maintaining the peace during the time that the Sioux and the other American tribes were forced from the United States into the area of Wood Mountain. \\" The M√©tis had a strong relationship with the Sioux, especially with Chief Sitting Bull. \\"The fires of 1880 on Wood Mountain resulted in the movement of our people to other communities. It was at this time that the M√©tis pioneers moved to Willow Bunch at the suggestion of Andre Gaudry.\\" The M√©tis were already settled in Willow Bunch when the North West Resistance, led by Louis Riel, battled the Canadian government over land rights. It was in 1885, \\"the Resistance had an impact on the M√©tis of Willow Bunch...marked the end of the influence of the M√©tis on the development of Western Canada. \\" Following the 1885 Resistance, many changes occurred for the M√©tis nation of Willow Bunch. \\"[They] were told that the land property that [they] settled on didn't belong to [them]. It became an issue ... as new immigrants arrived [they] found their identity and culture continually being eroded. \\" The M√©tis of Willow Bunch still feel the indifference within this small town due to lack of the historical M√©tis knowledge to the newcomers. \\"That feeling of inferiority that many of [them] were taught to feel ... That practice of one group being denigrated at the expense of another is still evident today. \\" The M√©tis of Willow Bunch will hopefully coexist with the non-M√©tis community without the idea of superiority over another. Alike to most First Nations situations, the M√©tis will continue to fight for their rights not only in Willow Bunch but across this nation.  The Willow Bunch M√©tis Local #17  Willow Bunch The M√©tis Local #17 in Willow Bunch is one of the first Locals established within the M√©tis Nation of Saskatchewan.  Historical background to 1880  For Saskatchewan, Willow Bunch has the title as one of the oldest settlements established. Founded in 1870 by variety of groups of M√©tis hunters and settlers, Willow Bunch has strong historical connections with Red River M√©tis. Later on, Jean-Louis L√©gar√© would migrate from Manitoba to Willow bunch, where he played a lead role in early Willow Bunch history. In the mid-1800s, those who were living in Manitoba's Red River area were succumbing to the harsh climate and living conditions. Bison were becoming scarce due to over hunting in their area. Work was more difficult to find since the merging of the Hudson's Bay Company and the Northwest Company in 1821. Along with pests, frosts and droughts which led to lower crop harvests, over-population of the Metis people were a part of the uneasy living conditions. This led to the M√©tis migrating somewhere else to settle. The M√©tis had to stay close to the bison, which meant they were to move west of Red River. Places like Saint Joseph's in North Dakota became established winter places that the M√©tis would go to. Later, declining buffalo herds led to the M√©tis migrating farther and farther away. In the 1860s, living conditions, including crop conditions, were so severe that the Hudson's Bay Company had to step in to help avoid starvation. Later, the Red River M√©tis moved towards what is now southern Saskatchewan after the Red River Uprising in 1869. This led to the first Metis settlement established, called La Coulee Chapelle, which is St. Victor today (located about 19 km west of Willow Bunch). Before this uprising, areas like Wood Mountain, Eastend and Cypress Hills were places that M√©tis would migrate to. It is said that Andre Gaudry was one of the first settlers in the area. Willow Bunch was part of a district known as Montagne de Bois, or Wood Mountain.  1880‚Äì1910   Bonneauville  After a devastating prairie fire destroyed much of the grass and timber in the area around Wood Mountain, Saskatchewan, many First Nations and M√©tis people were driven by a bison shortage and an increasing population to seek out new settlements. Many settled along the Milk River, south of the 49th parallel, and the Frenchman River, one of its tributaries in Saskatchewan. A number of them settled in the area known by the M√©tis as Talle de Saules (clump of willows) and Hart Rouge, now known as Willow Bunch. In 1881, Jean-Louis L√©gar√©, a French-Canadian trader and one of the founding members of the Willow Bunch community, settled in what is part of the present- day Jean Louis L√©gar√© Regional Park.Willow Bunch Historical Sites and Buildings. Gilles A. Bonneau Ed. 4th Ed. Richmond Hill: Sure Print and Design, 2012; 17 L√©gar√©, who married into the M√©tis community, opened a trading post/store there, and often traded various necessities to the local M√©tis for bison goods. In the spring of 1881, it was estimated he had around $3,000 worth of bison products in his store. A boy named √âdouard Beaupr√©, better known as the Willow Bunch Giant, was the first child born and baptized in the area in 1881. The forerunner settlement of Willow Bunch was established in 1883, around two miles east of L√©gar√©'s store and one-and-a-half miles east of the present town. A small village grew around a spot where Reverend Pierre St. Germain, the head of the local parish at the time, chose to build a Catholic church. The chapel and residence were completed in 1884, and the settlement became known as Bonneauville with the arrival of Pascal Bonneau, Sr. and his family in 1886. The North West Mounted Police (NWMP) soon built a barracks in Bonneauville in 1886 as part of \\"B\\" Division, with 12 men and 13 horses, following the Riel Rebellion in Batoche in 1885. By fall of that year, however, only two constables were left.  Ranching: early years  Ranching soon became one of the mainstays of the local economy. L√©gar√© brought in 45 head of cattle from Manitoba in 1884, and petitioned Government of Canada to do a land survey in 1886. Eight townships were surveyed, including Bonneauville. By 1893, the NWMP reported there were 300 people in the Willow Bunch area. Sheep were introduced to the area in 1894, of which the M√©tis tended small herds. Growth, however, was slow for ranchers. Limited markets and a lack of transportation infrastructure in southwestern Saskatchewan forced ranchers to start out small. Bonneau, Sr. and his three sons began ranching in 1886 with only four horses and four cattle, but by 1900, Bonneau, Sr. had a herd of 400 head of cattle and 400 head of horses. After opening a cheese factory in 1888, Jean-Louis L√©gar√© maintained the largest ranching operation in the area for a time. The ranching operation of Bonneau, Sr.'s son, Pascal Bonneau, Jr., became even bigger. By 1900 Bonneau, Jr. had a herd of 5,000 to 6,000 head. Weather and prairie fires took their toll on ranchers in the area. A combination of drought and harsh winter weather between 1886 and 1887 devastated herds in southwestern Saskatchewan. L√©gar√© himself lost 350 head of cattle in 1893-1894, forcing the closure of the cheese factory. Prairie fires in 1885 were also responsible for the destruction of the willows that the town and area were named for. Ranchers gave little thought about where their cattle roamed, and often did not grow hay for the winter. L√©gar√© was among those who rejected the use of hay. In 1903‚Äì04, a severe winter, recounted by Reverend Claude J. Passaplan as the worst in recorded history at the time, followed prairie fires and an early frost, leaving cattle with nothing to eat. The M√©tis around Willow Bunch lost all of their cattle as a result. An even worse winter in 1906‚Äì07 caused a loss of an estimated 60 to 70 per cent of all cattle in southwestern Saskatchewan.  Beginnings of Willow Bunch  Slowly, farming began to overtake ranching, and thoughts of moving the settlement into a more suitable site for growing the community began in 1898. The Catholic Bishop of the area made a request for 160 acres of land, but received only 80 from Jean-Louis L√©gar√©, which became the present site of Willow Bunch. Several delays from a number of changes to the headship of the local parish delayed action until 1905, the year of Saskatchewan's confederation, when Reverend Alphonse Lemieux was assigned to the parish. He arrived in Bonneauville to find the church in a dilapidated state. That year, a new rectory was built at the present site of Willow Bunch, followed by a new church in 1906. The town that would become Willow Bunch started to grow. A hospital was built in 1909, headed by Dr. Arsene Godin, called the Red Cross Hospital. The first official act of the Rural Municipality of Willow Bunch #42 was a meeting, chaired by Pascal Bonneau, Jr., on January 4, 1910.  1911‚Äì1930  At the end of 1927, according to the Willow Bunch \\"Parish Bulletin\\", there were \\"77 baptisms, 11 marriages and six burials for a population of 1,348 distributed over 227 families of which 219 are French- speaking.\\" During this time several buildings that were constructed, the residents celebrated their 50-year golden jubilee and there was an active political culture. But by the end of 1929, over 200 people had left Willow Bunch due to the intense drought and the effects of the Great Depression.  Notable buildings  The Convent of the Sisters of the Cross was built in April‚ÄìMay 1914 using a $3,000 grant from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Regina. The stones and sand for the foundation and all building materials were hauled for free by parishioners of the Willow Bunch Catholic Church. Construction was halted after World War I broke out because of a lack of funding and the loss of many skilled workers who joined the army. Construction resumed and was completed in 1921. In 1920 the Statue of Sacred Heart of Jesus was erected using donations of $4,000 from the community. The Statue was then consecrated on July 13, 1922 at the Golden Jubilee. In November 1922, T.W. Sr. and Kate Bennett's house served as the United Church of Willow Bunch until December 1926 when the United Church was opened and dedicated to the service and worship of God. Although the budget for the project was set at $1500 the town operated well below as the lot was bought for $175 and the carpenters were contracted for $850. In 1924, The Canadian Red Cross installed a nursing outpost at the Willow Bunch hospital, also known as the \\"Pasteur Hospital.\\" The hospital was expanded to more than twice its length in 1925. On September 14, 1927, the Sisters of Charity of St. Louis took over general operations but the Sisters left in 1929 due to the Depression. The first home built with running water and flush toilets was completed in 1917. In 1922, the Willow Bunch Rural Telephone Company was founded and a building was erected. That year, there were 12 subscribers. In 1926, a railroad line was constructed through Willow Bunch, enabling passenger train service.  Golden Jubilee  On July 12 and 13, 1922, Willow Bunch celebrated its 50th Anniversary in a Golden Jubilee Celebration. On the first day, a mass was attended by 800 people.  Political culture  William W. Davidson was elected as the Conservative Party Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) in the provincial Willow Bunch electoral district in 1912. Abel James Hindle was elected the Liberal Party MLA from 1917 to 1925 at which time he stepped down and passed the nomination to James Albert Cross. Cross was MLA until 1929 when another Liberal, Charles William Johnson was elected. At the Federal level, the Federal riding of Willow Bunch was established in 1924, and Thomas Donnelly was elected and remained in power until the riding was abolished in 1933. On November 8, 1922, Donnelly attempted to introduce a motion that \\"the federal government of the Dominion of Canada should no longer assist immigrants to this country in any financial way except so far as financial assistance is at present being extended to female domestics.\\" When the Willow Bunch Municipal Council heard Austria-Hungary, Germany and Turkey wanted to negotiate for peace with the Allies at the close of World War I, they offered this reply: > This municipality is overjoyed at even the prospect of a possibly peace, but > not the peace evolved by terms. One does not make peace with a mad dog or a > venomous reptile. There can be but one condition and one only under which > hostilities will cease- imperialism strangled beyond resuscitation and > militarism banished for ever. Peace on these conditions may be possible but > on no other. According to the Willow Bunch Legion, there were seven recorded > Willow Bunch casualties during World War I.  1931-1945   The drought and aftermath  Throughout the 1930s, Willow Bunch and the rest of southern Saskatchewan was hit with numerous dust storms. The dust storms were the outcome of a devastating drought, and the agricultural damage ended up costing the Saskatchewan provincial government more than $20 million. The drought also spawned a swarm of grasshoppers. In 1937, the Sitkala school, which had only two classrooms, was destroyed by fire.  Southern Saskatchewan Coal Operators' Association  Despite the poor agriculture, the production of coal was on the rise. On Sept. 19, 1932, Willow Bunch hosted the first annual meeting of the Southern Saskatchewan Coal Operators' Association at the R.M.'s municipal hall. At the meeting, association president Robert Campkin discussed how the unity of local mines would help increase the retrieval of lignite coal. The price of lignite was set at $2 per ton in the 1930s.  Wheat resurgence  Once the weather stabilized, the price of wheat spiked from six bushels per acre in 1938 to 16 bushels per acre in 1939. Willow Bunch welcomed the first load of wheat to the town's south country grain elevator on Aug. 5, 1939. The wheat came from a local farm, which was renowned as the \\"Million Dollar Farm\\" because of its exceptional wheat quality.  Establishing the credit union  Willow Bunch established a credit union in 1942, creating a membership-owned alternative to private banks. Newspapers The Willow Bunch Beacon, a local newspaper, was published in 1943. It focused on postwar conflicts, the decline in wheat prices, the domestic coal situation in Saskatchewan, and Canada's need for more poultry, meat, and eggs. An annual subscription cost $1.50. The Avonlea Beacon was published from 1944 until 1951. 1943 to 1960 Beginning in 1943, Saskatchewan Power began supplying electricity to the village from a coal burning plant in Estevan.A Mosaic of Willow Bunch R.M. #42 Volume 1 page,18.

It became a theatre in 1931, and was the town's community social centre, showing movies, and also being used for Knights of Columbus meetings and bowling in the basement. It closed in 1969. In 1973, the building became town property.(Willow Bunch Museum Picture Reference) RCMP leave Willow Bunch In 1976, the two-man Royal Canadian Mounted Police detachment in Willow Bunch moved to the nearby town of Coronach, Saskatchewan. Residents of Willow Bunch protested at the Regina Legislature on two occasions to prevent the move.Regina Leader Post June 23, 1976 \\"Moving RCMP decision soon\\" page 2Regina Leader Post \\"Premier Rejects Marcher's Plea\\" page 20  1990 - present   Grain elevators  The old Saskatchewan Wheat Pool C elevator in Willow Bunch. It is now privately owned. For many years there were four grain elevators in Willow Bunch. Saskatchewan Wheat Pool No. 88 A, United Grain Growers (UGG) No. 1 and the McLaughlin Elevator all opened in 1926. McCabe Brothers began operations in 1929. The capacity of each elevator varied between 30,000 and 32,000 bushels. By the early 1980s the elevators began to shut down, following a trend which was seen right across the province and the prairies. The Pool A, McLaughlin (which by then was Pool B) and McCabe Brothers (now UGG No. 2) elevators all closed in 1984. UGG No. 1 would follow in 1999. The final elevator to close was Sask. Pool C, which opened in 1982 with a capacity of 3,670 metric tonnes, ceased operations in 2001. It is now privately owned.  Willow Bunch School  The former Willow Bunch School. Enrolment at Willow Bunch School had been declining since the mid-1960s, when approximately 425 students were enrolled. In 2006, the school's population was approximately 50 students. In 2007, the Prairie South School Division began a review of its schools in seven communities, including Willow Bunch. The division maintained it was becoming a challenge to \\"deliver an effective learning program in a fiscally responsible manner.\\" In 2007, the Prairie South School Division voted to close five schools by the end of August, including the school in Willow Bunch.  Library  In 2009 the library moved to a new home. Established in 1973, the Willow Bunch Library is a branch of the Palliser Regional Library. Originally located in the Hills of Home Senior Centre, the entire collection was moved to the former RM office, which was vacated in 2008 as the Town of Willow Bunch and RM offices were amalgamated. The move took place on April 20, 2009, with the grand opening a month and a half later on June 12.  Political history  Municipal organization began in Willow Bunch in the year 1910, when the community was formed as District #42. A meeting which was held at Philip L√©gar√©'s house, chaired by Pascal Bonneau, Jr. on January 4, marked the first official act. Pascal Bonneau Jr., Dr. Arsene Godin, Alphonse Dauphinais, Amedee Beaubien, W. Ineson, James Hazlett, and A. Saunier were the first members, elected in 1910. Amedee Beaubien replaced Pascal Bonneau, Jr. as president after Bonneau died. E.P. de Laforest was elected secretary-treasurer for the year 1910 and was replaced by Alex P. Beausoleil in 1911. The results of the elections in December 1911 were Treffle Bonneau as Reeve/Mayor, and O.A. Hainstock, B. Lowman, Alphonse Dauphinais, Peter Kabrud, Joseph Lapointe, and Alfred Lalonde were elected as councillors. In 1912, Treffle Bonneau served as the first reeve of Willow Bunch Rural Municipality (RM) #42. This meant that he was also the mayor for the town at this time. In 1913, a committee which Treffle Bonneau served on sought provincial intervention in relation to rural municipal taxation on grazing lands. In 1927, the first RM- owned office was built and Leopold Sylvestre, the secretary-treasurer, occupied the office from 1927 to 1958. He served 31 years, making him the longest serving secretary-treasurer of any RM in the province. In 1961, Rachel Skinner was elected to her second term as councillor. Mrs. George Drouin also served her second term that year, and the two women were said to give stronger representation on a six-man council than any other town in the province. In 1912, there was a redistribution of federal electoral districts, including the RM of Willow Bunch. At the time, it was decided that the redistribution was fair and provided for the just representation of the people. However, the federal electoral district riding of Willow Bunch that was created in 1924 was abolished in 1933 when the riding was redistributed into Moose Jaw, Swift Current and Wood Mountain. Liberal Candidate Dr. Thomas Donnelly was elected to the new riding in 1925. He also won in the 1926 and 1930 elections. During the 1928 Liberal Party nomination, Donnelly was the unanimous choice of the Liberals of the Willow Bunch provincial constituency. The other nominees were T.E. Gamble, an MLA from Ogema, J.B Swift, from Assiniboia, Thomas Gallant from Gravelbourg, and A.J. Hindle, ex-M.L.A for Willow Bunch. The Conservative candidate, nominated in 1928, was J. Gibbins, a farmer from the Assiniboia district. A political issue of the day had to do with whether to give immigrants financial assistance. In 1928, there was a resolution that no further financial assistance would be given by the federal government. Notice of a motion on the topic was given by Dr. Donnelly in Willow Bunch in 1928. In 1929, a vote recount had to take place in Willow Bunch following the application of the unsuccessful candidate, C.W Johnson. Notable people * √âdouard Beaupr√©, one of the tallest men in recorded history. * Carmen Campagne, children's entertainer. Women's organizations Through various groups and organizations that the women of Willow Bunch belong to, they often spend their time volunteering and raising money for charities and community causes. The Legion Ladies Auxiliary #287 was formed June 8, 1974 in Willow Bunch. Its curling team won first in the Legion auxiliary zone district curling bonspiel in 1982. The Catholic Women's League started on October 29, 1963 in Willow Bunch. The League says it is, \\"dedicated to serving the needs of the community and increasing the spiritual growth of its members as they work and share together\\". Its members raise money doing raffles, teas, bake sales, etc. and then donate to various organizations and charities. The Federation des Femmes Canadiennes Fran√ßaises was originally formed in 1914 in Canada to help soldiers of World War I. It came to Willow Bunch in 1967. Since the war their goal has been to help French Canadian women reach their full potential and to be proud of their heritage as a member of the minority in the community. They have carried out substantial work for different charities including distributing meals for, \\"Meals on Wheels\\". The Happy Hobby Club originated at the house of Elizabeth \\"Beth\\" Marie Louise Viala in October 1955. They enjoyed themselves meeting on a weekly basis and often worked on projects, which they sold to raise money for charities (such as quilts). They also put on social events in the Community Centre (formerly the Sharon School building). They had annual picnic for members and their families; one year, 100 people were in attendance. The Kinettes Club of Willow Bunch was formed on January 27, 1978 with Mary Eger as the formation president. Their goal was to help with Kinsmen club projects as well as to start their own projects in order to promote Willow Bunch and stimulate community interest. Their events include Ladies Night Out and the Community Birthday Calendar.  The Convent  Willow Bunch Museum Mannequin- Sister The Willow Bunch Convent was operated by the Sisters of the Cross. It was opened in 1914 for students and over 40 boarders who would live there, and the 91 Sisters who served until the closing of the school in 1983.  Mayors and reeves  In 1912, Willow Bunch was recognized as a rural municipality by the Government of Saskatchewan. The first reeves were Treffle Bonneau, O.A. Hainstock, B. Lowman, Alphonse Dauphinais, Peter Kabrud, Joseph Lapointe and Alfred Lalonde. Willow Bunch officially became a village on November 15, 1929. After this, the village nominated its first \\"overseer\\", Emmanuel Lebel. On October 1, 1960, Willow Bunch was incorporated as a town, with overseer Marcel Ingrand as mayor. Geography Climate and ecology Willow Bunch sits in a small valley in southern Saskatchewan, about 740 metres above sea level. Underground aquifers are one of the most important water sources in the area, although many are too deep to drill wells into.  Willow Bunch Lake  Willow Bunch Lake, located north of the town, is 2200 feet along the base and 1875 feet in the northeastern region of the lake.  Vegetation and soil  The hills in the areas surrounding Willow Bunch provided for difficult soil to farm on, however it acted as good grazing area for cattle ranchers. Evan Radford - WB Grain Elevator Large scale cultivation was impractical for early settlers, as the soil contained saline flats, stony deposits, and slough areas, and the settlement lacked railway access to export markets. Livestock was preferred, particularly by the M√©tis, enabled by the hills and grassy pastures near Willow Bunch. The area experienced drought in the 1890s, and livestock losses were significant in 1893. By 1884, bison no longer roamed the Willow Bunch area, which affected the settlement's M√©tis, who were forced to focus more on farming.  Industry  Crops Yields in Rural Municipality of Willow Bunch No. 42 Agriculture has been and continues as Willow Bunch's largest industry, with spring wheat, durum, oats, barley, and flax seeing the most consistent production over the last 30 years, since 1982. Among these top five crops, the most productive year over the past 70 was in 1993 when 71.5 bushels per acre of oats were produced. These numbers are gathered from the rural municipality of Willow Bunch, RM 42, an area spanning 1,047.8 square kilometres. As of the 2011 Canadian census, there were 102 farms in the Willow Bunch area, operated by a total of 125 farmers. The average age of farm operators in the area is 53.4, while the average farmer's age overall in Saskatchewan is 54.2. In the area, there are 16 animal production farms and 86 crop production farms. Along with a sustainable agricultural industry, Willow Bunch has seen the trademark grain elevators and rail lines that allow the industry to thrive. In 1925, CN expanded its railway into the town, operating up until the mid-2000s. The Saskatchewan Trails Association lists the rail line between Willow Bunch and Bengough as being abandoned around 2005. For a large portion of the 1900s, four massive grain elevators towered over Willow Bunch. They were owned by United Grain Growers Ltd., Saskatchewan Pool Elevators Ltd., McLaughlin Company Ltd., and McCabe Brothers Grain Co. Ltd. Today, only one elevator remains, built in 1983, originally owned by the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, and now jointly owned and operated as Prairie Giant Processing Inc. It is used for grain storage and cleaning. In days past, the mining industry was a particular boon to residents of the town and area. Immigrants who had experience with coal mining in Europe, located lignite coal in the area and developed coal mines, including open pit, shaft, and straight cut. Twenty three different mines were in operation during the early to mid-1900s, all with different owners. Fr√©d√©rick Desjardins' mine stands out as the longest operating, continuing until the late 1950s. Currently, the nearest coal mine is in Coronach; the Popular River Mine employs 800 people.  Services  Evan Radford - WB Thrift Shop Services include a town-owned thrift shop, a volunteer fire department; an auctioneering service; the Jolly Giant Pub; the Stagecoach Motel; Route 36 Sales & Service, a convenience store and gas bar; a Conexus Credit Union; a community rink, library, and swimming pool; the Hills of Home Senior Centre Club; a variety store; and the RM office for the region.  Transportation  There are two highways servicing Willow Bunch. Highway 36 runs on a north-south axis, eventually reaching the United States border at the Coronach Border station, and extending north to Highway 13. Highway 705 intersects Willow Bunch on an east-west axis, spanning 63 kilometres west to Wood Mountain, and extending more than 230 kilometres east, stopping at provincial Highway 47.

Dutch Hollow Art Club  The Dutch Hollow Art Club formed in 1954 after the country school of Dutch Hollow closed. Activities include shell craft, sewing, ceramics, and cookbook making.  Tourism   Willow Bunch Museum  Willow Bunch Museum The museum supplies the history of its town and surrounding area in a former convent of the Sisters of the Cross. The Museum was established in 1972 by a group of local students through a government summer employment program. It has two full floors of eight exhibits, which are individually dedicated to √âdouard Beaupr√©, pioneers, the chapel, town archives, homemakers, M√©tis, Northwest Mounted Police/tools and technology, and the hospital. Local and former residents donated the artifacts; however, many of them are packed in boxes that are still waiting to be displayed.  Agriculture  The Willow Bunch area relies primarily on agriculture for income. There are currently 102 active farms in the area, producing grains, spring oats, winter oats, lentils, barley, nuts, berries, and livestock.

Before Willow Bunch became situated in its current location in the early 20th century, it was known as Bonneauville.Bonneau, G.A.

Vol. 1. 1998. Print. It was, however, known as a \\"Free Catholic School.\\" At the time, Bonneauville was governed by the North-West Territories, as the province of Saskatchewan had yet to be created. There was no legislative act regulating education in the area. Consequently, the school was dependent on ratepayers for funding.North-West Territories Act, RSNWT 1875, c 49, s 11. Web. 16 October 2013. Having this burden enabled the residents of Bonneauville, under the North-West Territories Act of 1875, to choose which language the school would teach their children in. Because records were vague during the school's first two years of operation, it is difficult to ascertain which language they learned in. However, it is likely that they learned in French because the majority of residents were francophones in 1888. On November 28, 1888, the school was formally established as Sitkala Roman Catholic Public (R.C.P.) # 23 by Proclamation of Lieutenant Governor Joseph Royal.Thomas, L.H. \\"Letter to Sister Andre-Joseph.\\" Regina: Legislative Library, 8 June 1951.

They were taught reading, dictation, writing, arithmetic, drill, grammar, and geography, all in French. They also learned English as a second language. In 1907, Sitkala R.C.P. relocated to what would be known as Willow Bunch. The Sisters of the Cross Convent, a private, French-English school, was built there seven years later in 1914.

In 1931, the School Act prohibited French as the sole language of instruction in schools. However, it allowed students to be taught solely in French from Kindergarten to Grade 1. Students in higher grades were able to learn in French for one hour each day. Six years later, in 1937, Sitkala R.C.P. joined the public school system. Increasing enrolment rates led the Convent to follow suit, but 12 years later in 1949. The Willow Bunch School was built that same year. With three schools in the town, minimal French education remained a part of the curriculum.

The current community skating rink was built in 1957, and a lobby was added in 1959. Willow Bunch Museum Originally built as a convent in 1914 by the Sisters of the Cross, this three-storey mansard-roof edifice is now Willow Bunch Museum. Planning and construction of the convent began in April 1914. During the First World War construction was momentarily suspended as many of the workers who were originally from France left the town to fight in the war. Because of this, the interior of the top floor was never finished. The building also has served as a private and public school during its existence. The building was put up for sale in 1983 due to declining members of the convent, and the school division no longer renting classroom space, and was purchased by the town in 1985 to house the museum.

In 1989, he founded Israel's first independent, national school for film and television, the Sam Spiegel Film and Television School ‚Äì Jerusalem, and has served as its director since that time.Mike Leigh cancels Israel visit over loyalty oath bill - Ben Child - guardian.co.uk During the last 40 years he founded or co- founded the infrastructure of Israeli film funds and cinematheques. In December 2016 he was awarded the Chevalier des arts et lettres by the French government.  Accomplishments  In 1978, Schorr founded the Israel Film Fund together with Judd Ne'eman and Yeud Levanon. The Fund revolutionized the industry by shifting public support from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to the Ministry of Education and Culture, an act that recognized the cultural value of a film over its mere commercial worth. In addition, the Fund gave unprecedented power to the director over the producer. Schorr was the co- director of the Beit Zvi Film School from 1982‚Äì1985, and in In July 1989, was chosen to found a new film school in Jerusalem, now the Jerusalem Sam Spiegel Film and Television School. He remains its director to this day. Schorr saw to it that Israeli film schools, Steve Tisch School of Film and Television at Tel Aviv University and the Sam Spiegel Film and Television School, became members of GEECT, the European union of film schools. In 2000, he was chosen by 70 of his fellow school directors to serve as president of CILECT/GEECT. During his four-year term, he initiated and organized numerous conferences about European cinema, aiming to define and characterize European cinema as opposed to American films, and to advance the standing of the entrepreneurial producer. Schorr worked with the European Film Academy under the presidency of German director Wim Wenders and championed the inclusion of Israel as a member of the Academy. In 1992, Schorr devised the creation of another fund, the New Fund for Film and Television, which spearheaded a revolution in independent documentary filmmaking in Israel. The establishment of such a fund resulted in the flourishing of the documentary, which had previously been an underserved and underdeveloped product of public television. In 2001, Renen Schorr initiated and edited the prize-winning dramatic series Voices from the Heartland for Israeli commercial TV. The enterprise served as an incubator for select young talents, graduates of various Israeli film schools. At a point where opportunities to work in the creative dramatic field were few and far between, Schorr created a supportive platform for these individuals to create their first dramatic efforts, paving the way for their entrance to the foreground of Israeli television and cinema. Voices From the Heartland went on to win six prizes in the Jerusalem Film Festival, 2001 and 2002. Two of the films from the series, James' Journey to Jerusalem, directed by Ra'anan Alexandrowicz, and Slaves of the Lord by Hadar Friedlich were screened at Cannes Director's Fortnight 2001. In 2008, Schorr led the formation of Israel's first municipal film fund, the Jerusalem Film and Television Fund. Among the 60 films and television shows that the Fund has supported are A Tale of Love and Darkness by Natalie Portman, ‚ÄúThe Policeman‚Äù by Nadav Lapid and ‚ÄúDig‚Äù by Gideon Raff. Renen Schorr serves as chairperson of the board of directors at the Fund. In 2008 he set up the Herzeliya Cinematheque and the Holon Cinematheque. This was part of his vision to expand the audience for both Israeli and independent films as an alternative to commercial chains. Schorr has served as a juror for numerous international competitions and festivals including Berlinale (2011), the Sarajevo Film Festival (2016), DocAviv (2009) and the Israel Prize (2004). He has conducted masterclasses about the methodology of the Sam Spiegel Film School at various film schools such as Sarajevo, Istanbul, Berlin, New York and San Jose, Costa Rica.  The Jerusalem Sam Spiegel Film School  The school works on a triangular model and offers three tracks: the Full Track ‚Äì Training students in directing, screenwriting, cinematography, editing and production. In 1999, the school began a two-year track for screenwriters, with the aim of creating a model for cooperation between screenwriters and directors, and with a specialization in writing for television. In 2004, the school inaugurated a four-year track for entrepreneur producers, the first of its kind in Israel. Since the first crop of films in 1993, the school has become recognized as one of the leading film schools in the world, winning over 290 international prizes, among them 15 awards as the World's Best School, as well as recognition at over 160 international festivals, museums and film schools in 55 countries. The Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies at University of Cambridge has held a tribute to the school two years in a row, 2016 and 2017. The school's films have twice won the First Prize at the Cannes Film Festival (2008, 2016). Under the direction of Renen Schorr, The Sam Spiegel International Film Lab was launched in December 2011, with the goal of fostering the development and production of full-length feature films by some of the world's most promising talents. The Sam Spiegel International Film Lab became the third film lab of its kind in the world, along with The Sundance Institute and The Torino Film Lab in Italy. The Academy Award-winning film Son of Saul, by L√°szl√≥ Nemes was developed at the Sam Spiegel International Film Lab in 2014. In October 2014, as part of the 25th anniversary celebrations for the school, Schorr initiated a fifth film fund. The Sam Spiegel Alumni Fund for First Features was set up with the aim of supporting alumni as they make their first feature film.  Major films as director  Schorr's 1985 short film, A Wedding in Jerusalem, told for the first time, the story of two of Israel's leading cultural figures; director Uri Zohar and singer Arik Einstein, on the occasion of the Orthodox wedding of their children. Unprecedented, A Wedding in Jerusalem was screened in cinemas across the country as the film before the Coen Brother's Blood Simple. The film was restored in 2016 and was the opening film at the Jerusalem Jewish Film Festival, at the Jerusalem Cinematheque. Late Summer Blues (1987) is Schorr's most prominent film. It won the Silver Menorah award (Israel Academy Award) for best film, best screenplay and best original score, as well as the prize for outstanding film in the Israel Film Festivals in New York and Los Angeles.[3] The film opened the Jerusalem Film Festival in 1987 to rave reviews and became a commercial success seen by 20,000 people, It was screened in 30 international festivals including, Montreal, Moscow, Toronto, Chicago, Los Angeles, Vienna, Dublin, Hong Kong. The film was released in the United States and Canada. Over the years, the movie has become a cultural icon. After undergoing digital restoration, Late Summer Blues was released for screenings around Israel in honor of its 30th anniversary in 2016. The Loners (HaBodedim) debuted in November 2009. Inspired by true events that took place in an Israeli military prison in 1997, the film explores the plight of two young Russian immigrant soldiers who are falsely accused of treason. The Loners was nominated for 11 Ophir Prizes (Israeli Academy Awards), and was named winner of the Best Actor Award (Sasha Agronov) and Best Film Award at The South Festival. It was chosen Winner of the Best Film Award, Open Doek Festival in Belgium, and participated in such festivals such as the Pusan Film Festival, South Korea, Cape Town Film Festival, Seattle International Film Festival, Cottbus Film Festival Germany, Tirana International Film Festival Albania, London Jewish Film Festival, Toronto Jewish Film Festival, the Boston Jewish Film Festival, and IsraFest L.A. Despite all of this, the film did not gain commercial success. As a screenwriter and script editor, Schorr wrote the screenplays for his own short films, served as a script consultant-as well as assistant director to both Uri Zohar, and to Judd Ne‚Äôeman on his film Paratroopers (1977). He edited the screenplay for the international award- winning film Broken Wings (2002) directed by Nir Bergman.

His work has been translated into over fifteen languages. Biography Arrighi was born in Milan, Italy in 1937. He received his Laurea in economics from the Bocconi University in 1960. Arrighi began his career teaching at the University College of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and later at the University College of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. During this period he developed arguments about how the labor supply and labor resistance affected the development of colonialism and national liberation movements. It was there that he met Immanuel Wallerstein, later a collaborator on a number of research projects. After returning to Italy in 1969, Arrighi and others formed the \\"Gruppo Gramsci\\" in 1971. In 1979 Arrighi joined Wallerstein and Terence Hopkins as a professor of sociology at the Fernand Braudel Center for the Study of Economies, Historical Systems, and Civilizations at Binghamton University. It was during this time that the Fernand Braudel Center became known as the main center of world-systems analysis, attracting scholars from all over the world. His most famous work was a trilogy on the origins and transformations of global capitalism, which began in 1994 with a book that reinterpreted the evolution of capitalism, The Long Twentieth Century: Money, Power, and the Origins of Our Times. The book is a classic in the field, published in at least ten languages. Giovanni completed a second edition of The Long Twentieth Century in 2009. In 1999, he published Chaos and Governance in the Modern World System with Beverly Silver, and in 2007, he published Adam Smith in Beijing: Lineages of the Twenty-First Century, comparing Western and East Asian economic development and exploring China‚Äôs rise as an economic world power. Although in many ways intellectually close to Immanuel Wallerstein, Arrighi tends to ascribe greater significance to the recent shift in economic power to East Asia. He also emphasized his debt to Adam Smith, Max Weber, Karl Marx, Antonio Gramsci, Karl Polanyi and Joseph Schumpeter. Arrighi died in his home in Baltimore on June 18, 2009. He had been diagnosed with cancer in July 2008. He is survived by his wife and partner in scholarship, Professor Beverly Silver, and his son Andrea Arrighi. A retrospective interview by David Harvey on his intellectual trajectory, The Winding Paths of Capital, was published in the March/April 2009 issue of New Left Review.

Plot introduction Firethorn, narrated by the protagonist of the same name, starts out as Luck, a 'mudfolk' orphan with unusually red hair serving an ageing noblewoman, the Dame, in a land where the division between high and lowborn is literally attributed to the gods. Too restless to live her fate as a drudge and too proud to accept the inevitable abuse that accompanies it after the Dame's death, Luck runs. A year in the mountains spent starving to death makes her desperate enough to eat the poisonous berries of the firethorn tree but instead of dying, she has a revelation that may well include a god-granted gift. Emerging from the forest, calling herself Firethorn, she tries to return to civilisation, knowing she can never quite fit. In the Upside-Down Days (ten days when the high and lowborn trade places) she meets Sire Galan, a visiting lord who takes her as his lover. When he marches off to war and suggests she tag along as his 'sheath' (a woman that follows a soldier to war and shares his bed), she jumps at the chance just to get away. But life as a camp follower waiting for war may well be something that not even Firethorn can survive... Plot summary A mysterious foundling with unique red hair and strange god-given powers, Firethorn is condemned to life as a powerless servant‚Äîor so she believes, until one of King Thyrse's noblemen becomes her lover. But, as she accompanies Sire Galan to war, Firethorn discovers she may have traded one form of bondage for another. A soldier's mistress‚Äîeven a high- born soldier's mistress‚Äîis despised as a \\"sheath,\\" or camp follower. Also, Firethorn's nasty ex-overlord, Sire Pava, has joined the king's army, and she has made a new enemy in her lover's cousin and closest friend, the sadistic Sire Rodela. However, she and Galan share a fiery love that will surely overcome the opposition of both their personal enemies and their kingdom's enemies. Then Sire Galan makes a strange, heart-shattering wager that may not only ruin his honor, but get them both killed.

Of these, 1,194,527 were purchased for use in Kansas City by the packing houses and local markets; the remainder or about 55 percent was shipped out. Of 2,736,174 hogs received, 879,031 were shipped out; of 377,038 calves, 199,084 were shipped out; of 1,165,606 sheep, 445,539 were shipped and of 42,987 horses and mules, all but 1,664 were shipped out.\\" The stockyards flourished through the 1940s. At its peak only the Union Stock Yards in Chicago was bigger. Business dropped off dramatically after the Great Flood of 1951 which devastated the stockyards and associated businesses and slaughterhouses. After the flood, the stockyards never recovered. The stockyards straddled the state line across the Kansas river with two thirds of it in Kansas and one third in Missouri. At its peak 16 railroads converged at the yards. Recently In 1974 the City of Kansas City and the American Royal livestock show tried to reclaim the area by building Kemper Arena on the former stockyards land. The closing of the stockyards ended Kansas City's overt ties to being a cowtown. The stockyard's biggest heritage then became the annual six-week American Royal agricultural show held each October and November nearby at Kemper Arena until 2010. The naming rights to Kemper Arena were sold to Mosaic Life Care in 2016, but the healthcare company gave them back. In May 2018, the developers of Kemper Arena announced that it would be called Hy-Vee Arena. The American Royal livestock show is moving to a new location in Kansas near the speedway.

Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry, then working as chief engineer at Joe Gibbs' studio, was scouting for talent for Gibbs' new Amalgamated label, and spotted the group while they were auditioning for the 1967 Festival Song Contest with \\"The Time Has Come\\". Perry signed the group to the label, but left Gibbs soon after. The Versatiles stayed with Gibbs for two years, before moving to work with Perry, and then to Duke Reid's Treasure Isle label, also recording for other producers such as Laurel Aitken. The group split up in 1970, with Byles still working as a firefighter but continuing to record solo for Perry (sometimes with the other former-Versatiles providing harmonies). Solo peak When Perry's association with Bob Marley came to an end, he sought a singer-songwriter to work with who would fill the void, and Byles fit the bill. With Perry, Byles had a minor hit with \\"What's The World Coming To\\", released under the name King Chubby, and over the next five years the partnership would result in some of Perry's most highly regarded work, with Byles' Rastafarian beliefs clearly evident, including \\"Beat Down Babylon\\", \\"King of Babylon\\", and the plea for repatriation, \\"Place Called Africa\\". \\"Rub Up Festival\\" was Byles' entry for the Festival Song Contest in 1971, but the song's suggestive lyric led to it being disqualified after reaching the final eight. The following year's \\"Festival Da Da\\" fared better, finishing as second runner-up. Also in 1972, Byles began self-producing, and set up his Love Power label, releasing singles such as \\"Black Crisis\\" and \\"Our Mistakes\\". Byles was one of several reggae musicians to offer support to Michael Manley's 1972 general election campaign, releasing the singles \\"Joshua Desire\\" and \\"Pharaoh Hiding\\" (\\"Joshua\\" referring to Manley and \\"Pharaoh\\" to the ruling Jamaican Labour Party's leader Hugh Shearer).Greene, Jo-Anne, \\"[ Junior Byles Biography]\\", Allmusic Manley was elected, but improvements for Jamaica's poor were not immediately apparent, and Byles was one of several artists who had supported Manley who voiced dissent, releasing the scathing \\"When Will Better Come?\\".Katz, David (2003), Solid Foundation: An Oral History of Reggae, Bloomsbury, At the end of 1972, Byles had his biggest hit to date, with a cover version of Peggy Lee's \\"Fever\\", with a dubby rhythm produced by Perry. November 1972 saw the release of Byles debut album, Beat Down Babylon, which along with a series of singles that followed, established Byles as a major force in Jamaica as well as establishing him with audiences in the United Kingdom, \\"Curley Locks\\" being particularly successful there. Byles moved away from Perry in the mid-1970s, recording three duets with Rupert Reid for Dudley Swaby and Leroy Hollett's Ja-Man label, as well as recording for Lloyd Campbell (\\"Bury-O-Boy\\") and Pete Weston (covers of \\"Ain't Too Proud To Beg\\" and \\"Oh Carolina\\"). Regarded by some as his greatest work, \\"Fade Away\\" was recorded in 1975 for producer Joseph Hoo Kim; It was a massive hit in Jamaica and was also a big success in the UK, and was covered five years later by Adrian Sherwood's New Age Steppers group. It also featured on the soundtrack for the film Rockers. He also released a second album, Jordan, in 1976, produced by Weston. Health problems and later career By 1975, Byles' health had begun to decline. Suffering from depression, he was deeply affected by the death of Haile Selassie, unable to reconcile this with his belief in Selassie's divinity, and attempted suicide. He was admitted to Bellevue Hospital, after which his health continued to decline. Although he had regular spells in the hospital, he continued to record, reworking \\"King of Babylon\\" for Winston Holness, working again with Campbell, and recording a cover of The Archies' \\"Sugar Sugar\\" with Big Youth. By the end of 1976, he had all but vanished from the music scene, with a comeback attempted in 1978, recording two singles for Joe Gibbs. It was clear that he was still not well, however, and it would be 1982 before he re-emerged, working with New York City label Wackie's. Progress on a planned new album was slow, and Byles was beset by tragedy when his mother died, and he lost his home in a fire. His wife and children also emigrated to the United States, and aside from a few singles, Byles would release nothing until 1986's Rasta No Pickpocket album. The album did not, however, see a long-lived upturn in Byles' fortunes, and by the following year, he was living on the street, scavenging for food in dumpsters, and begging from passers-by.Henry, Balford, \\"S.O.S. for fallen entertainers \\", Jamaica Gleaner. Byles occasionally resurfaced, recording \\"Young Girl\\" for Holness in 1989, and \\"Little Fleego\\" three years later, and played a few live shows with Earl \\"Chinna\\" Smith in 1997 and 1998. He contributed to the Medicine I compilation album in 2000,\\"The Record Shop\\", Jamaica Gleaner. and returned to live performance in 2004 in Jamaica, receiving positive reviews.Walker, Karyl (2004), \\"Junior Byles Makes Triumphant Return\\", Jamaica Observer, 19 January 2004Belcher, Deborah (2004) \\"Fiery devils disturb 'Rebel Salute'\\", Jamaica Gleaner, 23 January 2004. This led to a short tour of the United Kingdom. His legacy of recordings from the 1970s, however, maintain his status as one of roots reggae's leading talents. A diagnosis of prostate cancer and his ongoing mental health issues resulted in renewed attention in Jamaica toward Byles' health and musical legacy in the late 2010s. In early 2019, a benefit and celebratory concert took place, followed by a large cash donation to Byles from the charity foundation of dancehall artist Bounty Killer the following year.

Written in 1907, it was first produced at Strindberg's Intimate Theatre in Stockholm on 21 January 1908. Since then, it has been staged by such notable directors as Max Reinhardt, Olof Molander, Roger Blin, and Ingmar Bergman. Bergman directed it four times: in 1941, 1954, 1973, and 2000. Strindberg took the title from Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 17 in D minor, which he called 'The Gespenster Sonata', and also Piano Trio No. 4 in D major, known as the 'Ghost Trio'. The Ghost Sonata is a key text in the development of modernist drama and a vivid example of a chamber play. In it, Strindberg creates a world in which ghosts walk in bright daylight, a beautiful woman is transformed into a mummy and lives in the closet, and the household cook sucks all the nourishment out of the food before she serves it to her masters. Plot The Ghost Sonata relates the adventures of a young student, who idealizes the lives of the inhabitants of a stylish apartment building in Stockholm. He makes the acquaintance of the mysterious Jacob Hummel, who helps him to find his way into the apartment, only to find that it is a nest of betrayal and sickness. The world, the student learns, is hell and human beings must suffer to achieve salvation. The play centers on a family of strangers who meet for the sake of meeting. They exchange no dialogue, nor gestures, they simply sit and bask in their own misfortune. To Strindberg, family was something that he could never understand or even be a functioning part of: \\"Family... the home of all social evil, a charitable institution for comfortable women, an anchorage for house-fathers, and a hell for children\\" (Strindberg's Inferno). As a child, Strindberg went through the very hell he alludes to about the family. As an adult he realized that he would rather have died than lived a childhood hell and an adult hell, thus spawning a mania fixating on death.

Berkowitz grew up in New York City and served in the U.S. Army before committing his crimes. Using a .44 caliber Bulldog revolver, he killed six people and wounded seven others by July 1977. The killing spree terrorized New Yorkers and gained worldwide notoriety. As the number of victims increased, Berkowitz eluded the biggest police manhunt in the history of New York City while leaving letters that mocked the police and promised further crimes, which were highly publicized by the press. On the night of August 10, 1977, Berkowitz was taken into custody by NYPD homicide detectives in front of his Yonkers apartment building; he was subsequently indicted for eight shooting incidents. He confessed to all of them, and initially claimed to have been obeying the orders of a demon manifested in the form of a dog belonging to his neighbor \\"Sam.\\" Despite his explanation, Berkowitz was found mentally competent to stand trial. He pled guilty to second-degree murder and was incarcerated in state prison. He subsequently admitted that the dog-and-devil story was a hoax. In the course of further police investigations, Berkowitz was also implicated in many unsolved arsons in the city. Intense coverage of the case by the media lent a kind of celebrity status to Berkowitz, which he seemed to enjoy, as noted by some observers. In response, the New York State Legislature enacted new statutes, known popularly as \\"Son of Sam laws\\", designed to keep criminals from financially profiting from the publicity created by their crimes. The statutes have remained law in New York despite various legal challenges, and similar laws have been enacted in several other states. Berkowitz has been incarcerated since his arrest and is serving six consecutive life sentences. During the mid-1990s, he amended his confession to claim that he had been a member of a violent Satanic cult that orchestrated the incidents as ritual murder. A few law enforcement authorities have said that his claims might be credible, but he remains the only person ever charged with the shootings. A new investigation of the murders began in 1996, but was suspended indefinitely after inconclusive findings.  Early life  David Berkowitz was born Richard David Falco on June 1, 1953, in Brooklyn, New York.Abrahamsen, David (1985). Confessions of Son of Sam. New York: Columbia University Press. . His mother, Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Broder, grew up as part of an impoverished Jewish family, and was a waitress. She married Tony Falco, an Italian American, in 1936. After a marriage of less than four years, Tony Falco left her for another woman. In 1950, Broder started a relationship with a married man named Joseph Klineman. Three years later, she became pregnant with a child to whom she chose to give the surname Falco and, within a few days of Richard's birth, Broder gave the child away. Although her reasons for doing so are unknown, writers have surmised that Klineman threatened to abandon her if she kept the baby and used his name.Leyton, p. 206. The infant boy was adopted by Pearl and Nathan Berkowitz of the Bronx. The Jewish-American couple were hardware store retailers of modest means, and childless in middle age. They reversed the order of the boy's first and middle names and gave him their own surname, raising young David Richard Berkowitz as their only child. Journalist John Vincent Sanders wrote that Berkowitz's childhood was \\"somewhat troubled\\". Although of above-average intelligence, he lost interest in learning at an early age and became infatuated with petty larceny and starting fires. Neighbors and relatives would recall Berkowitz as difficult, spoiled, and a bully. His adoptive parents consulted at least one psychotherapist due to his misconduct, but his misbehavior never resulted in a legal intervention or serious mention in his school records.Leyton. He attended Public School #123 and Public School #77. Berkowitz's adoptive mother died of breast cancer when he was 14 years old, and his home life became strained during later years, particularly because he disliked his adoptive father's second wife. He lived with his father while attending Christopher Columbus High School (graduating in 1971) and college in a four-and-a-half-room apartment at 170 Dreiser Loop in Co-op City in the Bronx from 1967 to 1971.Case File: David Berkowitz Retrieved June 17, 2009 In 1971, at the age of 17, Berkowitz joined the United States Army and served in Fort Knox in the United States and with an infantry division in South Korea.Leyton, p. 217.Klausner, p. 32; p. 42. After an honorable discharge in June 1974, he located his birth mother, Betty. After a few visits, she disclosed the details of his birth. The news greatly disturbed Berkowitz, and he was particularly distraught by the array of reluctant father figures. Forensic anthropologist Elliott Leyton described Berkowitz's discovery of his adoption and birth details as the \\"primary crisis\\" of his life, a revelation that shattered his sense of identity.Leyton, pp. 187ff. His communication with his birth mother later lapsed, but for a time he remained in communication with his half-sister, Roslyn. He attended Bronx Community College for one year, enrolling in the spring of 1975. In 1976 he went to work as a driver for the Co-Op City Taxi Company. He subsequently had several non- professional jobs, and at the time of his arrest was working as a letter sorter for the United States Postal Service.Leyton, p. 192.  Crimes begin (late 1975‚Äìearly 1977)  During the mid-1970s, Berkowitz started to commit violent crimes. He bungled the first attempt at murder using a knife, then switched to a handgun and began a lengthy crime spree throughout the New York boroughs of the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. He sought young female victims. He was purportedly most attracted to women with long dark wavy hair.Rossmo, pp. 164‚Äì66. All but one of the crime sites involved two victims; he infamously committed some of his attacks while the women sat with boyfriends in parked cars. He exhibited an enduring enjoyment of his activities, often returning to the scenes of his crimes.  Forman stabbing (December 1975)  Berkowitz claimed that when he was 22 years old he committed his first attack on Christmas Eve, 1975, when he used a hunting knife to stab two women in Co-op City. One alleged victim, a Hispanic woman, was never identified by police, but the other was 15-year-old Michelle Forman, a sophomore at Truman High School, whom he attacked on a bridge near Dreiser Loop and whose injuries were serious enough for her to be hospitalized for seven days.Klausner, pp. 17‚Äì18. Berkowitz was not suspected of these crimes, and soon afterward he relocated to an apartment in Yonkers, New York, just north of the New York City border, 20 to 25 minutes from Co-Op City.Klausner, pp. 18‚Äì19.  Lauria and Valenti shooting (July 1976)  The first shooting attributed to the Son of Sam occurred in the Pelham Bay area of the Bronx. At about 1:10 a.m. on July 29, 1976, Donna Lauria, an emergency medical technician, 18, and her friend Jody Valenti, a nurse, 19, were sitting in Valenti's double-parked Oldsmobile, discussing their evening at Peachtree's, a New Rochelle discotheque.Terry (1999), pp. 23‚Äì24. Lauria opened the car door to leave and noticed a man quickly approaching the car. Startled and angered by the man's sudden appearance, she said, \\"Now what is this‚Ä¶\\" The man produced a pistol from the paper bag that he carried and crouched. He braced one elbow on his knee, aimed his weapon with both hands, and fired. Lauria was struck by one bullet that killed her instantly. Valenti was shot in her thigh, and a third bullet missed both women. The shooter turned and walked away quickly. Valenti survived her injury and said that she did not recognize the killer. She described him as a white male in his thirties with a fair complexion, about tall and weighing about . His hair was short, dark, and curly in a \\"mod style\\". This description was repeated by Lauria's father, who claimed to have seen a similar man sitting in a yellow compact car parked nearby. Neighbors gave corroborating reports to police that an unfamiliar yellow compact car had been cruising the area for hours before the shooting.  Denaro and Keenan shooting (October)  On October 23, 1976, a similar shooting occurred in a secluded residential area of Flushing, Queens, next to Bowne Park. Carl Denaro, a Citibank security guard, 20, and Rosemary Keenan, a Queens College student, 18, were sitting in Keenan's parked car when the windows suddenly shattered. \\"I felt the car ,\\" Denaro said later. Keenan quickly started the car and sped away for help. The panicked couple did not realize that someone had been shooting at them, even though Denaro was bleeding from a bullet wound to his head. Keenan had only superficial injuries from the broken glass, but Denaro eventually needed a metal plate to replace a portion of his skull. Neither victim saw the attacker. Police determined that the bullets embedded in Keenan's car were .44 caliber, but they were so deformed that they thought it unlikely that they could ever be linked to a particular weapon.Terry (1999), p. 27. Denaro had shoulder-length hair, and police later speculated that the shooter had mistaken him for a woman.Serial Killers p. 166 Keenan's father was a 20-year veteran police detective of the New York City Police Department (NYPD), causing an intense investigation. As with the Lauria‚ÄìValenti shooting, however, there seemed not to be any motive for the shooting, and police made little progress with the case. Many details of the Denaro‚ÄìKeenan shooting were very similar to the Lauria‚ÄìValenti case, but police did not initially associate them, partly because the shootings occurred in different boroughs and were investigated by different local police precincts.  DeMasi and Lomino shooting (November)  High school student Donna DeMasi, 16, and Joanne Lomino, a student at Martin Van Buren High School, 18, walked home from a movie soon after midnight on November 27, 1976. They were chatting on the porch of Lomino's home in Floral Park, when a man dressed in military fatigues who seemed to be in his early 20s approached them and began to ask directions. In a high-pitched voice he said, \\"Can you tell me how to get...\\" but then quickly produced a revolver. He shot each of the victims once and, as they fell to the ground injured, he fired several more times, striking the apartment building before running away. A neighbor heard the gunshots, rushed out of the apartment building, and saw a blond man rush by gripping a pistol in his left hand. DeMasi had been shot in the neck, but the wound was not life-threatening. Lomino was hit in the back and hospitalized in serious condition; she was ultimately rendered paraplegic.  Freund and Diel shooting (January 1977)  At about 12:40 a.m. on January 30, 1977, Christine Freund, a secretary, 26, and her fianc√© John Diel, a bartender, 30, were sitting in Diel's car near the Forest Hills LIRR station in Queens, preparing to drive to a dance hall after having seen the movie Rocky. Three gunshots penetrated the car. In a panic, Diel drove away for help. He suffered minor superficial injuries, but Freund was shot twice and died several hours later at the hospital. Neither victim had seen their attacker. Police made the first public acknowledgment that the Freund‚ÄìDiel shooting was similar to earlier incidents, and that the crimes might be associated. All the victims had been struck with .44 caliber bullets, and the shootings seemed to target young women with long dark hair. NYPD sergeant Richard Conlon stated that police were \\"leaning towards a connection in all these cases.\\"Terry (1999), p. 32.New York Daily News, February 1, 1977. Composite sketches were released of the black-haired Lauria‚ÄìValenti shooter and the blond Lomino‚ÄìDeMasi shooter, and Conlon noted that police were looking for multiple suspects, not just one.  Voskerichian shooting (March 8)  At about 7:30 p.m. on March 8, 1977, Columbia University student Virginia Voskerichian, 19, was walking home from school when she was confronted by an armed man. She lived about a block from where Christine Freund had been shot. In a desperate move to defend herself, Voskerichian lifted her textbooks between herself and her killer, but the makeshift shield was penetrated, the bullet striking her head and killing her.Leyton, p. 193.  Press and publicity (March 10)  In a March 10, 1977, press conference, NYPD officials and New York City Mayor Abraham Beame declared that the same .44 Bulldog revolver had fired the shots that killed Lauria and Voskerichian.Terry (1999), pp. 38‚Äì40. Official documents were later revealed, however, saying that police strongly suspected that the same .44 Bulldog had been used in the shootings, but that the evidence was actually inconclusive. The crimes were discussed by the local media virtually every day. Circulation increased dramatically for the New York Post and Daily News, newspapers with graphic crime reporting and commentary.Klausner, p. 370. Foreign media featured many of the reports as well, including front page articles of newspapers such as the Vatican's L'Osservatore Romano, the Hebrew newspaper Maariv, and the Soviet Izvestia.  Crimes continue (April‚ÄìJuly 1977)   Esau and Suriani shooting (April)  At about 3:00 a.m. on April 17, 1977, Alexander Esau, a tow truck operator, 20, and Valentina Suriani, an aspiring actress and model, 18, were sitting in Suriani's car near her home in the Bronx, only a few blocks from the scene of the Lauria‚ÄìValenti shooting, when each was shot twice. Suriani died at the scene, and Esau died in the hospital several hours later without being able to describe his attacker(s). Police said that the weapon used for the crime was the same as the one which they had suspected in the earlier shootings.  Crime-scene letters (May)   Son of Sam letter  Police discovered a handwritten letter near the bodies of Esau and Suriani, written mostly in block capitals with a few lower- case letters, and addressed to NYPD Captain Joseph Borrelli.Scott, p. 73. With this letter, Berkowitz revealed the name \\"Son of Sam\\" for the first time. The press had previously dubbed the killer \\"the .44 Caliber Killer\\" because of his weapon of choice.Gibson, p. 13. The letter was initially withheld from the public, but some of its contents were revealed to the press, and the name \\"Son of Sam\\" quickly replaced the old name. The letter expressed the killer's determination to continue his work, and taunted police for their fruitless efforts to capture him.Gibson, pp. 13‚Äì14. In full, with misspellings intact, the letter read: Final page of the first Son of Sam letter At the time, police speculated that the letter-writer might be familiar with Scottish English. The phrase \\"me hoot it urts sonny boy\\" was taken as a Scottish- accented version of \\"my heart, it hurts, sonny boy\\"; and the police also hypothesized that the shooter blamed a dark-haired nurse for his father's death, due to the \\"too many heart attacks\\" phrase, and the facts that Lauria was a medical technician and Valenti was studying to be a nurse.Terry (1999), pp. 43‚Äì44. The killer's unusual attitude towards the police and the media received widespread scrutiny. Psychologists observed that many serial killers gain gratification by eluding pursuers and observers. The feeling of control of media, law enforcement, and even entire populations provides a source of social power for them. After consulting with several psychiatrists, police released a psychological profile of their suspect on May 26, 1977. He was described as neurotic and probably suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, and believed himself to be a victim of demonic possession.Terry (1999), p. 47.  Letter to Jimmy Breslin  On May 30, 1977, Daily News columnist Jimmy Breslin received a handwritten letter from someone who claimed to be the .44 Caliber Shooter. The letter was postmarked early that same day in Englewood, New Jersey. On the reverse of the envelope, neatly hand-printed in four precisely centered lines, were the words: Blood and Family ‚Äì Darkness and Death ‚Äì Absolute Depravity ‚Äì .44. The letter inside read: Underneath the \\"Son of Sam\\" was a logo or sketch that combined several symbols. The writer's question \\"What will you have for July 29?\\" was considered an ominous threat: July 29 would be the anniversary of the first .44 caliber shooting. Breslin notified police, who thought that the letter was probably from someone with knowledge of the shootings. The Breslin letter was sophisticated in its wording and presentation, especially when compared to the crudely written first letter, and police suspected that it might have been created in an art studio or similar professional location by someone with expertise in printing, calligraphy, or graphic design.Terry (1999), p. 51. The unusual writing caused the police to speculate that the killer was a comic letterer, and they asked staff members of DC Comics whether they recognized the lettering. The \\"Wicked King Wicker\\" reference caused police to arrange a private screening of The Wicker Man, a 1973 horror movie.Walker, p. 111. The New York Daily News published the letter a week later (after agreeing with police to withhold portions of the text) and Breslin urged the killer to surrender himself. The dramatic article made that day's paper the highest-selling edition of the Daily News to date‚Äîmore than 1.1 million copies were sold.Klausner, p. 166. Police received thousands of tips based on references in the publicized portions of the letter, all of which proved useless. All the shooting victims to date had long dark hair, and thousands of women in New York acquired short cuts or brightly colored dyes, and beauty supply stores had trouble meeting the demand for wigs.  Lupo and Placido shooting (June)  On June 26, 1977, there was another shooting. Sal Lupo, a mechanic's helper, 20, and Judy Placido, a recent high school graduate, 17, had left the Elephas discotheque in Bayside, Queens, and were sitting in Lupo's parked car at about 3:00 a.m. when three gunshots blasted through the vehicle. Lupo was wounded in the right forearm, while Placido was shot in the right temple, shoulder, and back of the neck, but both victims survived their injuries. Lupo told police that the young couple had been discussing the Son of Sam case only moments before the shooting.Klausner, p. 185, 187. Neither Lupo nor Placido had seen their attacker, but two witnesses reported a tall, dark-haired man in a leisure suit fleeing from the area; one claimed to see him leave in a car and even supplied a partial license plate number.  Moskowitz and Violante shooting (July)  The first anniversary of the initial .44 caliber shootings was approaching, and police established a sizable dragnet that emphasized past hunting grounds in Queens and the Bronx. However, the next and final .44 shooting occurred in Brooklyn. Early on July 31, 1977, Stacy Moskowitz, a secretary, and Robert Violante, a clothing store salesman, both 20, were in Violante's car, which was parked under a streetlight near a city park in the neighborhood of Bath Beach, on their first date. They were kissing when a man approached within three feet of the passenger side of Violante's car and fired four rounds into the car, striking both victims in the head before he escaped into the park. Violante lost his left eye; Moskowitz, the only blonde victim of Berkowitz, died from her injuries. That night, Detective John Falotico was awakened at home and told to report to the 10th Homicide Division at the 60th Precinct station house in Coney Island. He was given two weeks to work on the Moskowitz and Violante case as a normal murder investigation‚Äîif it could not be solved in that timeframe, it was to be given to the Son of Sam task force.  Suspicion and capture (August 1977)   Suspicion (August 9)  Local resident Cacilia Davis was walking her dog at the scene of the Moskowitz and Violante shooting when she saw patrol officer Michael Cataneo ticketing a car that was parked near a fire hydrant. Moments after the traffic police had left, a young man walked past her from the area of the car, and he seemed to study her with some interest. Davis felt concerned because he was wielding in his hand some kind of \\"dark object\\". She ran to her home only to hear shots fired behind her in the street. Davis remained silent about this experience for four days until she finally contacted police, who closely checked every car that had been ticketed in the area that night. Berkowitz's 1970 four-door yellow Ford Galaxie was among the cars that they investigated. On August 9, 1977, NYPD detective James Justis telephoned Yonkers police to ask them to schedule an interview with Berkowitz. The Yonkers police dispatcher who first took Justis' call was Wheat Carr, the daughter of Sam Carr and sister of Berkowitz's alleged cult confederates John and Michael Carr.Terry (1999), p. 98. Justis asked the Yonkers police for some help tracking down Berkowitz. According to Mike Novotny‚Äîa sergeant at the Yonkers Police Department‚Äîthe Yonkers police had their own suspicions about Berkowitz in connection with other strange crimes in Yonkers, crimes that they saw referred to in one of the Son of Sam letters. Yonkers investigators even told the New York City detective that Berkowitz might just be the Son of Sam.  Arrest (August 10)  The next day, August 10, 1977, police investigated Berkowitz's car that was parked on the street outside his apartment building at 35 Pine Street in Yonkers. They saw a rifle in the back seat, searched the car, and found a duffel bag filled with ammunition, maps of the crime scenes, and a threatening letter addressed to Inspector Timothy Dowd of the Omega Task Force. Police decided to wait for Berkowitz to leave the apartment, rather than risk a violent encounter in the building's narrow hallway; they also waited to obtain a search warrant for the apartment, worried that their search might be challenged in court. The initial search of the vehicle was based on the rifle that was visible in the back seat, although possession of such a rifle was legal in New York State and required no special permit. The warrant still had not arrived when Berkowitz exited the apartment building at about 10:00 p.m. and entered his car. Detective John Falotico approached the driver's side of the car. Falotico pointed his gun close to Berkowitz's temple, while Detective Sgt. William Gardella pointed his gun from the passenger's side. A paper bag containing a .44-caliber Bulldog revolver of the type that was identified in ballistics tests was found next to Berkowitz in the car. Berkowitz then stated flatly, \\"Well, you got me.\\" As described in Son of Sam (1981) by Lawrence D. Klausner, Detective Falotico remembered the big, inexplicable smile on the man's face: An alternate version claimed that Berkowitz's first words were reported to be, \\"Well, you got me. How come it took you such a long time?\\"Scott, p. 77.Terry (1999), p. 113. Detective John Falotico was officially credited by the NYPD as the arresting officer of the Son of Sam. Police searched Apartment 7-E and found it in disarray, with Satanic graffiti on the walls. They also found diaries that he had kept since he was 21 years old‚Äîthree stenographer's notebooks nearly all full wherein Berkowitz meticulously noted hundreds of arsons that he claimed to have set throughout New York City.Gibson, p. 22. Some sources allege that this number might be over 1,400. Soon after Berkowitz's arrest, the address of the building was changed from 35 Pine Street to 42 Pine Street in an attempt to end its notoriety. After the arrest, Berkowitz was briefly held in a Yonkers police station before being transported directly to the 60th Precinct in Coney Island, where the detectives' task force was located. At about 1:00 a.m., Mayor Abraham Beame arrived to see the suspect personally. After a brief and wordless encounter, he announced to the media: \\"The people of the City of New York can rest easy because of the fact that the police have captured a man whom they believe to be the Son of Sam.\\"  Confession (August 11)  Berkowitz was interrogated for about 30 minutes in the early morning of August 11, 1977. He quickly confessed to the shootings and expressed an interest in pleading guilty. The investigation was led by John Keenan, who took the confession. During questioning, Berkowitz claimed that his neighbor's dog was one of the reasons that he killed, stating that the dog demanded the blood of pretty young girls. He said that the \\"Sam\\" mentioned in the first letter was his former neighbor Sam Carr. Berkowitz claimed that Harvey, Carr's black Labrador Retriever, was possessed by an ancient demon and that it issued irresistible commands that Berkowitz must kill people. A few weeks after his arrest and confession, Berkowitz was permitted to communicate with the press. In a letter to the New York Post dated September 19, 1977, Berkowitz alluded to his original story of demonic possession, but closed with a warning that has been interpreted by some investigators as an admission of criminal accomplices: \\"There are other Sons out there, God help the world.\\"Terry (1999), p. 147. At a press conference in February 1979, however, Berkowitz declared that his previous claims of demonic possession were a hoax.Leyton, p. 203.Ramsland, p. 289. Berkowitz stated in a series of meetings with his special court-appointed psychiatrist David Abrahamsen that he had long contemplated murder to get revenge on a world that he felt had rejected and hurt him.  Sentencing and prison   Sentencing  Three separate mental health examinations determined that Berkowitz was competent to stand trial.Ewing, p. 45. Despite this, defense lawyers advised Berkowitz to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, but Berkowitz refused.Ewing, p. 47. He appeared calm in court on May 8, 1978, as he pleaded guilty to all of the shootings. At his sentencing two weeks later, Berkowitz caused an uproar when he attempted to jump out of a window of the seventh-floor courtroom. After he was restrained, he repeatedly chanted \\"Stacy [his last victim] was a whore\\" and shouted \\"I'd kill her again. I'd kill them all again.\\" The court ordered another psychiatric examination before sentencing could proceed. During the evaluation, Berkowitz drew a sketch of a jailed man surrounded by numerous walls; at the bottom he wrote, \\"I am not well. Not well at all\\". Nonetheless, Berkowitz was again found competent to stand trial. On June 12, 1978, Berkowitz was sentenced to 25-years-to-life in prison for each murder, to be served consecutively. He was ordered to serve time in Attica Correctional Facility, an Upstate New York supermax prison. Despite prosecutors' objections, the terms of Berkowitz's guilty plea made him eligible for parole in 25 years.  Detention  After his arrest, Berkowitz was initially confined to a psychiatric ward in Kings County Hospital where the staff reported that he seemed remarkably troubled by his new environment. On the day after his sentencing, he was taken first to Sing Sing prison, and then to the upstate Clinton Correctional Facility for psychiatric and physical examinations. Two more months were spent at the Central New York Psychiatric Center in Marcy before his admission to Attica prison. Berkowitz served about a decade in Attica until he was relocated (c. 1990) to Sullivan Correctional Facility in Fallsburg, where he remained for many years until he was transferred to Shawangunk Correctional Facility in Ulster County. Berkowitz described life in Attica as a \\"nightmare.\\" In 1979, there was an attempt on Berkowitz's life in which the left side of his neck was slashed from front to back, resulting in a wound that required more than 50 stitches to close. Berkowitz refused to identify his assailant, and he only claimed that he was grateful for the attack‚Äîit brought a sense of justice or, in Berkowitz's own words, \\"the punishment I deserve\\".  Born-again Christianity  In 1987, Berkowitz became an evangelical Christian in prison. According to his personal testimony, his moment of conversion occurred after reading Psalm 34:6 from a Bible given to him by a fellow inmate. He says he is no longer to be referred to as the \\"Son of Sam\\" but the \\"Son of Hope.\\" Soon after his imprisonment, Berkowitz invited Malachi Martin, an exorcist, to help him compose an autobiography, but the offer was not accepted.Guiley, p. 168. During later years, Berkowitz developed his memoirs with assistance from evangelical Christians. His statements were released as an interview video, Son of Hope, during 1998, with a more extensive work released in book form, entitled Son of Hope: The Prison Journals of David Berkowitz (2006). Berkowitz does not receive any royalties or profit from any sales of his works. He has continued to write essays on faith and repentance for Christian websites. His own official website is maintained on his behalf by a church group, since he is not allowed access to a computer. Berkowitz stays involved with prison ministry, and regularly counsels troubled inmates.Sifakis, pp. 24‚Äì25. While in the Sullivan facility, he pursued education and graduated with honors from Sullivan Community College.  Parole hearings  Berkowitz is entitled to a parole hearing every two years as mandated by state law, though he has consistently refused to ask for his release, sometimes skipping the hearings altogether. Before his first parole hearing in 2002, Berkowitz sent a letter to New York Governor George Pataki demanding that it be canceled. He wrote, \\"In all honesty, I believe that I deserve to be in prison for the rest of my life. I have, with God's help, long ago come to terms with my situation and I have accepted my punishment.\\"Ewing, p. 50. Officials at the Sullivan facility rejected his demand. In his 2016 hearing at Shawangunk, New York, Berkowitz stated that while parole was \\"unrealistic,\\" he felt he had improved himself behind bars, adding: \\"I feel I am no risk, whatsoever.\\" His lawyer, Mark Heller, noted that prison staff considered Berkowitz to be a \\"model prisoner.\\" Commissioners denied a parole. In 2018, the board again denied the release of Berkowitz on parole. His next hearing was scheduled for May 2020. The novel, Covid-19 virus, delayed his hearing until further notice.  Other activities  In 2002, during the D.C. sniper attacks, Berkowitz wrote a letter telling the sniper to \\"stop hurting innocent people.\\" Berkowitz made his comments in a three-page letter to Rita Cosby, senior Chicago correspondent for Fox News Channel, after Cosby wrote to him seeking his comment on the sniper attacks. During June 2005, Berkowitz sued one of his previous lawyers for the misappropriation of a large number of letters, photographs, and other personal possessions. Hugo Harmatz, a New Jersey attorney, had represented Berkowitz in an earlier legal effort to prevent the National Enquirer from buying one of his letters. Harmatz then self-published his own collection of letters and memorabilia‚ÄîDear David (2005)‚Äîwhich he had obtained from Berkowitz during their consultations. Berkowitz stated that he would drop the lawsuit only if the attorney signed over all the money he made to the victims' families. In October 2006, Berkowitz and Harmatz settled out of court, with Harmatz agreeing to return the disputed items and to donate part of his book profits to the New York State Crime Victims Board.  Satanic cult claims  In 1979, Berkowitz mailed a book about witchcraft to police in North Dakota. He had underlined several passages and written a few marginal notes, including the phrase: \\"Arliss [sic] Perry, Hunted, Stalked and Slain. Followed to Calif. Stanford University.\\"Terry (1987), p. 16. The reference was to Arlis Perry, a 19-year-old North Dakota newlywed who had been murdered at Stanford on October 12, 1974. Her death, and the notorious abuse of her corpse in a Christian chapel on campus, was a widely reported case. Berkowitz mentioned the Perry attack in other letters, suggesting that he knew details of it from the perpetrator himself. Local police investigators interviewed him but they \\"now [2004] believe he has nothing of value to offer.\\" The Arlis Perry case has since been solved. After his admission to Sullivan prison, Berkowitz began to claim that he had joined a Satanic cult in the spring of 1975. In 1993, Berkowitz made these claims known when he announced to the press that he had killed only three of the Son of Sam victims: Donna Lauria, Alexander Esau, and Valentina Suriani. In his revised version of the events, Berkowitz said that other shooters were involved and that he fired the gun only in the first attack (Lauria and Valenti)Terry (1999), p. 528. and the sixth (Esau and Suriani).Terry, p. 530. He said that he and several other cult members were involved in every incident by planning the events, providing early surveillance of the victims, and acting as lookouts and drivers at the crime scenes. Berkowitz stated that he could not divulge the names of most of his accomplices without putting his family directly at risk. Among Berkowitz's alleged unnamed associates was a female cult member whom he claims fired the gun at Denaro and Keenan, both of whom survived, Berkowitz said, because the alleged accomplice was unfamiliar with the powerful recoil of a .44 Bulldog.Terry (1999), p. 529. Berkowitz declared that \\"at least five\\" cult members were at the scene of the Freund‚ÄìDiel shooting, but the actual shooter was a prominent cult associate who had been brought in from outside New York with an unspecified motive‚Äîa cult member whom he identified only by his nickname, \\"Manson II\\". Another unnamed person was the gunman in the Moskowitz‚ÄìViolante case, a male cult member who had arrived from North Dakota for the occasion, also without explanation.Terry (1999), pp. 530‚Äì31. Berkowitz did name two of the cult members: John and Michael Carr. The two men were sons of the dog-owner Sam Carr, and they lived on nearby Warburton Avenue.Terry (1987), p. 177. Both of these other \\"sons of Sam\\" were long dead: John Carr had been killed by a shooting judged a suicide in North Dakota during 1978, and Michael Carr had been in a fatal car accident in 1979. Berkowitz claimed that the actual perpetrator of the DeMasi‚ÄìLomino shooting was John Carr, and he added that a Yonkers police officer, also a cult member, was involved in this crime. He claimed that Michael Carr fired the shots at Lupo and Placido.Terry (1999), p. 539.  Case reopened  Journalist John Hockenberry asserts that, even aside from the Satanic cult claims, many officials doubted the single-shooter theory, writing, \\"what most don't know about the Son of Sam case is that from the beginning, not everyone bought the idea that Berkowitz acted alone.\\" John Santucci, Queens District Attorney at the time of the killings, and police investigator Mike Novotny both expressed their convictions that Berkowitz had accomplices. NYPD officer Richard Johnson, involved in the original investigations, has opined that unresolved discrepancies in statements from witnesses and surviving victims indicate Berkowitz did not act alone: \\"Why are there three [suspect] cars, five different [suspect] descriptions, different heights, different shapes, different sizes of the perpetrator? Somebody else was there.\\"Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis, The Son of Sam Speaks: The Untold Stories (1997); 29:35 ‚Äî 29:42 Other contemporaries have voiced their belief in the Satanic cult theory including Donna Lauria's father, and Carl Denaro who stated his opinion that \\"more than one person was involved\\" but admitted he could not prove the cult theory. Denaro's conclusion rests on his criticism of Berkowitz's statement to police as \\"totally false.\\"Terry (1999), p. 430 John Diel's recollection is that he physically bumped into Berkowitz outside the Wine Gallery restaurant as he and Christine Freund departed and walked to his car where the shooting occurred; Berkowitz, in contrast, told police that he passed within a few feet of Diel and Freund shortly before they entered the car. Diel contends he and Freund passed no one on their way to the car and further that the placement of the car parked at the curb would have made it impossible for Berkowitz to have snuck up on them in the few minutes between their encounter outside the restaurant and the shooting at the car. Diel thus reasons he was shot by someone other than Berkowitz.Terry (1999), p. 429-430 Hockenberry's own report was broadcast by network news and given much exposure by Dateline NBC (2004). In it, he discusses another journalist, Maury Terry, who had begun investigating the Son of Sam shootings before Berkowitz was arrested. Terry published a series of investigative articles in the Gannett newspapers in 1979 which challenged the official explanation of a lone gunman. Vigorously denied by police at the time, Terry's articles were widely read and discussed; they were later assembled in book form as The Ultimate Evil (1987; expanded second edition 1999). Largely impelled by these reports of accomplices and Satanic cult activity, the Son of Sam case was reopened by Yonkers police during 1996, but no new charges were filed. Due to a lack of findings, the investigation was eventually suspended but remains open. From prison Berkowitz continues to assert and expand upon his claims of demonic possession. He stated in a series of nine videos in 2015 that the \\"voice\\" he heard was that of Samhain, a druid devil and the true origin of \\"Son of Sam\\". He added that it never was a dog, saying that detail was fabricated by the media.  Skeptics  Berkowitz's later claims are dismissed by many. Breslin rejected his story of Satanic cult accomplices, stating that \\"when they talked to David Berkowitz that night, he recalled everything step by step by step. The guy has 1,000 percent recall and that's it. He's the guy and there's nothing else to look at.\\" Skeptics include a former FBI profiler, John E. Douglas, who spent hours interviewing Berkowitz. He states that he was convinced Berkowitz acted alone and was an \\"introverted loner, not capable of being involved in group activity\\". NYPD psychologist Dr. Harvey Schlossberg states in Against The Law, a documentary about the Son of Sam case, that he believes that the Satanic cult claims are nothing but a fantasy concocted by Berkowitz to absolve himself of the crimes. In his book Hunting Humans (2001), Elliott Leyton argued that \\"recent journalistic attempts to abridge‚Äîor even deny‚ÄîBerkowitz's guilt have lacked all credibility.\\"Leyton, p. 186.  Legacy  Decades after his arrest, the name \\"Son of Sam\\" remains widely recognized as that of a notorious serial killer. Many manifestations in popular culture have helped perpetuate this notoriety, while Berkowitz himself continues to express remorse on Christian websites. Neysa Moskowitz, who previously had not hidden her hatred of Berkowitz, wrote him a letter shortly before her own death in 2006, forgiving him for killing her daughter, Stacy. In a sad twist of fate, Moskowitz lost all her children at young ages (Jody, age 9 or 10, possibly a suicide; Stacy; and Ricki, about 38, of scleroderma, circa 1999). She had no survivors, except, according to the New York Post, her daughter's murderer.  Legal impact  After rampant speculation about publishers offering Berkowitz large sums of money for his story, the New York State Legislature swiftly passed a new law that prevented convicted criminals (and their relatives) from making any financial profit from books, movies, or other enterprises related to the stories of their crimes. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down the so-called \\"Son of Sam law\\" for violating the First Amendment's right of free expression in the 1991 case of Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Crime Victims Board, but New York produced a constitutionally revised version of the law in the following year. Similar laws have since been enacted in 41 states and at the federal level.  In popular culture   Literature  Jimmy Breslin, in collaboration with writer Dick Schaap, published a novelized account of the murders, .44 (1978), less than a year after Berkowitz's arrest. The highly fictionalized plot recounts the exploits of a Berkowitz-based character dubbed \\"Bernard Rosenfeld\\". Outside of North America, the book was renamed Son of Sam. The 2016 young adult novel Burn Baby Burn by Meg Medina is set in New York during 1977, and depicts how fear of being one of the Son of Sam victims affected the daily lives of people. He's also referred to by Lee Child in his Jack Reacher Series short novella High Heat (2013).  TV and film  The Spike Lee drama Summer of Sam was released in 1999 with actor Michael Badalucco in the role of Son of Sam. The film depicts the tensions that develop in a Bronx neighborhood during the shootings, and Berkowitz's part is largely symbolic. A minor character in the script, he functions \\"mostly as a berserk metaphor for Lee's view of the seventies as a period of amoral excess.\\"Pomerance, p. 147. Berkowitz was reported to be disturbed by what he called exploitation of \\"the ugliness of the past.\\" Other movie portrayals of Berkowitz include Ulli Lommel's Son of Sam (2008; direct-to- video)Son of Sam (2008), directed by Ulli Lommel. Retrieved September 27, 2012 ‚Äî via Rotten Tomatoes (2011). and the CBS television movie Out of the Darkness (1985).Wahl, p. 176. The character of Son of Sam played a significant minor role in the miniseries The Bronx Is Burning (2007).Mayo, pp. 32‚Äì33. Oliver Cooper portrayed him in the TV series Mindhunter (2019).  Music  Son of Sam has been popularly (and mistakenly) associated with the contemporaneous song \\"Psycho Killer\\" (1977) by Talking Heads. Likewise, Elliott Smith has stated that his song \\"Son of Sam\\" is not literally about Berkowitz. Compositions more directly inspired by the events include: * \\"Son of Sam\\" (1978) by The Dead Boys; * \\"Son of Sam\\" by Chain Gang; and * \\"Looking Down the Barrel of a Gun\\" (1989) by the Beastie Boys. Guitarist Scott Putesky used the stage name \\"Daisy Berkowitz\\" while playing with Marilyn Manson in the 1990s, and the band's song \\"Son of Man\\" conspicuously describes Berkowitz. Several other rock musicians established a full ensemble named Son of Sam during 2000. A cartoon composite of Berkowitz and the breakfast cereal icon Toucan Sam was featured in Green Jell√ø's comedy-rock video Cereal Killer (1992) by the name of \\"Toucan Son of Sam\\", but it was later removed under threat of a copyright lawsuit by the Kellogg Company.

It is an exclusive residential area and is home to the most expensive real estate in South Africa, with dwellings nestled on cliffs that have sweeping views of the Atlantic Ocean.\\"Cape Town woos Africans to Millionaire's Row\\" (Jan 2011) African Business 371 pp.54-55 Clifton was rated as one of the Top Ten Beaches by the cable and satellite television network Discovery Travel Channel in 2003 and 2004 and has received Blue Flag status. In 2005 and 2006 it was rated by Forbes at number 8 in the Top 10 Topless beaches in the World. Clifton is neighbored by the suburbs of Camps Bay and Bantry Bay. Tourism Lion's head from Clifton 4th Beach The area has a set of 4 beaches which are frequently used destinations for both locals and tourists.\\"CAPE TOWN\\" (Nov 2010) Arthur Frommer's Budget Travel, Intellitravel Media, Inc., New York The beaches, which are named from 1st to 4th, are separated by falls of granite boulders and have almost pure white granitic sand. The four beaches of Clifton are one of the few areas well protected from the notorious south-easterly wind, which has a great deal to do with its popularity with bathers. A fifth beach, before First Beach, called Moses Beach (so-called because of the papyrus plants that grow along it), appears and disappears as the sand is washed in and out with the seasons. The water, although chilly (12‚Äì16 ¬∞C), plays host to many watersports, mostly surfing, both board and body. The strongest surf is at First, diminishing to Fourth, where it is the weakest. Fourth beach (to the South), is the most populated and glamorous venue;\\"Cape Escape\\" (Dec 2005) Variety, suppl. V LIFE 400. 13: 46,48. attracting families. Yachts anchor off Fourth beach, especially on summer weekends. Third beach, the smallest beach, is known as a venue for gay culture. Second beach is populated by students playing beach volleyball and beach bats. First beach, to the north, draws a mixed crowd of locals and surfers. Clifton Beach was noted as one of Discovery's best beaches by region. Clifton's 4th beach has also been awarded the Blue Flag award in recognition of its environmental, safety and tourist standards. The small size of the properties on which bungalows are built between Fourth and Second beaches is attributable to the fact that the area was laid out by the City of Cape Town for returning soldiers who had fought in World War I. The original bungalows, now all but replaced by new structures, were built from the packing cases that conveyed imported motor cars during the 1920s and 30s. Narrow flights of stairs run between Victoria Road and the various beaches. These houses now fetch very high prices on the housing market, despite being only able to be reached by stairs, and, in most cases, having no garaging. Geography and climate Clifton seen from the Rocks during a sunset. An interesting feature of Clifton's 4 beaches involves the water temperatures and annual denudation and re-deposit of the bay's sugar- white sands, although for the most part protected in the 'wind shadow' of Lion's Head mountain that stands behind Clifton (on its eastern side). The strong prevailing south-east wind of summer (October to April), being off- shore, moves the warmer top layer of water out of the bay ‚Äì with the result that a compensating strong inflow of icy cold water is set up into the bay. This tends to make water temperatures in summer dip to their lowest levels ‚Äì sometimes below 10 ¬∞C. It also has the effect of re-depositing sand (stripped in winter) onto the beaches, so that by late summer, Clifton's beaches are at their widest, allowing for easy pedestrian movement along the waterline, from beach to beach. By contrast, winter's howling north-west gales drive warm surface-water into the bay, setting up a compensating outflow of water along the bottom. This water movement tends to cause the bay (and most of the adjacent Atlantic Seaboard) to fill with relatively warm water (10 - 20 ¬∞C) during winter ‚Äì but also strips the sand from the beaches, causing temporary beach erosion that exposes the granite boulder headlands that define the beaches. This peculiarity often startles those unaccustomed to the regular cycle; during these periods, city officials have been known to petition to have sand dumped on the Clifton shore to rectify what they perceive as a defect. But, each summer, Clifton repairs itself with new sand. Shark attacks Clifton has had just two separate shark attacks. In 1942, Johan Christian Bergh was attacked by a shark 30 meters off the 4th beach. Bergh's body was never recovered. Witnesses report seeing a 6-meter great white shark swim along the surf's backline and take Mr. Bergh in two rapid attacks. The attacks were so swift that Bergh did not have a chance to emit a sound ‚Äì consequently, few witnessed the event. On Saturday 27 November 1976, Jeff Spence, an 18-year-old submariner in the S.A. Navy was attacked by a 3.5 meter great white while treading water 100 meters from 4th beach. Spence suffered significant trauma to the left side of his torso ‚Äì with deep punctures and gouges back and front. Being an extremely hot day, no fewer than 6 doctors were on the beach at that time, and, together with the efforts of volunteer lifesavers from Clifton Lifesaving Club, Spence survived and was airlifted to hospital where he made a full recovery. The attacks notwithstanding, shark sightings are extremely rare in Clifton and on the Atlantic coast in general. Most supposed sightings turn out to be seals or sunfish. Controversy During the time of apartheid, the suburb and the beach was a racially demarcated area to only white people until early 1990s.  History  Clifton was originally called Skoenmakers Gat (Cobbler's Cave) after a ship deserter who lived in a cave above second beach. In 1794 the slave ship, S√£o Jos√© Paquete Africa, a Portuguese slaver carrying 400 slaves from Mozambique to Brazil ran aground. Two hundred lost their lives in the wreck and the surviving 200 were sold the following day in the town.

Biography  Born at Pilani in the northwestern Indian state Rajasthan on 12 October 1918, Krishna Kumar Birla was the second son of Ghanshyam Das Birla. He had one older brother, Shrinivas Birla, who was the son of Ghanshyam Das Birla by his deceased first wife, Durga Devi Birla. Krishna Kumar was the elder of the two sons born to Ghanshyam Das Birla's second wife, Mahadevi Birla, the other son being Basant Kumar Birla, father of Aditya Vikram Birla. Krishna Kumar also had three sisters, all of whom were born to Mahadevi Birla. Birla's birthday coincided with the Hindu festival of Gopashtami, which is associated with the Hindu god Krishna and thus led to the selection of his name. During his younger years, his family, which followed the Hindu calendar more diligently in those days, celebrated his birthday every year on Gopashtami. The Hindu calendar is a lunar calendar which does not coincide with the Gregorian calendar from year to year, and therefore his birthday was celebrated on a different Gregorian date every year. It was only for official purposes, such as government documents, that the date of 12 October was initially used, but in later years, it became the date on which his business associates and other associates in public life wished him, and it also came to be marked with a private celebration. Krishna Kumar's father, Ghanshyam Das Birla, was the founder of the Birla Group and he was one of India's richest and most celebrated businessmen. He was also a staunch follower of Mahatma Gandhi and a major financier of Gandhi's Congress Party in the years preceding and immediately following the Independence of India in 1947. Krishna Kumar joined Congress Party in 1984 as a life member. He was elected as a Rajya Sabha member in the same year, under the leadership of Indira Gandhi. He was a Member of Parliament for three terms from 1984 till 2002, served on several committees of Parliament. He was appointed twice, in 1980 and 2004, as a member of the National Integration Council chaired by the prime minister. Birla was one of the industrialists who supported economic reforms in India in 1991. K.K. Birla was among the few who supported reforms in 1991: PM; The Hindu, 13 December 2007 Birla was a Hindi Prabhakar (Honours in Hindi) and in 1997 was conferred the degree of Doctor of Letters (Honoris Causa) by Pondicherry University. In 1991, Birla established the K.K. Birla Foundation to promote Hindi literature. He was the chairman of one of the Hindustan Times. He was on the central board of the State Bank of India and ICICI.

Championship rings are unique to the North American sports. Since only one championship trophy is awarded by the league to the winning team, championship rings are distributed as a collectible memento for the actual players and team officials to keep for themselves to symbolize the victory. Winners' medals (and runners- up medals) are not awarded in North American professional sports, in contrast to Olympic team sports and European club association football tournaments such as the Premier League and UEFA Champions League. Championship rings are distributed by and paid for by the winning team (although some leagues may partially subsidize the cost), in contrast to medals which are awarded by the league or competition governing body. In addition, the championship in North American pro team sports is the culmination of the regular season and playoff tournament, while in European club football the league championship and domestic/continental cups are separate competitions. For North American pro teams, the playoff league championship is the single most significant part of the season. Indeed, most teams and fans in North America do not consider division titles or conference titles to be notable honors at all, and therefore in practice teams in major North American professional sports consider themselves to compete annually for only a single honor, the league championship, which is determined by a playoff tournament that is seeded based on regular season performance. This is in sharp contrast to European football clubs who celebrate and compete for both regular-season \\"league\\" titles and domestic/international playoff tournament \\"cups\\". Championship rings have long been part of North American sports lexicon. An individual's number of championship rings, rather than number of championship trophies, is often used by sportswriters as a tally of a their personal success, since it is more appropriate to write that it is the team/franchise/club and not the individual who wins the championship trophy (i.e. number of NBA Championship rings rather than Larry O'Brien Trophies won by former NBA coach Phil Jackson). In North American sports vernacular, a player's aim of wanting the \\"ring\\" is synonymous with winning the playoff league championship, and it has entered popular lexicon (retired basketball center Shaquille O'Neal was quoted as saying \\"My motto is very simple: Win a Ring for the King\\", former NHL goaltender Patrick Roy remarking \\"I can't hear what Jeremy says, because I've got my two Stanley Cup rings plugging my ears\\"). The four best known (and expensive) championship rings are the ones from the \\"Big Four\\" major professional sports leagues in North America; the Major League Baseball's (MLB) World Series ring, the National Basketball Association's (NBA) Championship ring, National Football League (NFL) Super Bowl ring, and the National Hockey League's (NHL) Stanley Cup ring. In North American sports, besides rings to commemorate winning the league championship game/series, rings are often presented to the championship game/series finalists (known as losers' rings, which are never worn), and conference championship game/series winners. There are also individual rings given to All-Star Game participants and inductees into a hall of fame. Description Championship rings are typically made of yellow or white gold with diamonds and other precious stones. They usually include the team name, team logo, and the championship number (usually indicated in Roman numerals for the NFL's Super Bowl wins). Championship ring policies differ between the four major professional leagues. NHL and MLB owners pay for the cost of the rings. The NFL pays up to $5,000 per ring for up to 150 rings for teams that win the Super Bowl. Teams can distribute any number of rings but must pay for any additional costs, and may offer lesser rings at their discretion. The NBA standardized its championship ring from 1969 through 1983; presently the winning team selects its own design and the league covers the cost of the rings. The winning team can typically present rings to whomever they choose, including usually, but not limited to: players (active roster or injured), coaches, trainers, executives, personnel, and general staff. In the NHL, since the Stanley Cup has limited space and stringent criteria, rings are often presented to current players who may not qualify to have their name engraved on the Cup. Some teams have also been known to give rings to former players who are not officially part of the winning team, including those who have been part of the roster for part of the title-winning season but traded away or waived before the playoffs (a common practice among MLB teams, where Arthur Rhodes, Bengie Molina, and Lonnie Smith played in the World Series against a team they played for earlier in the season, guaranteeing them World Series rings regardless of the series outcome). Retired players not involved with the team in an official capacity have received rings too, particularly those with a long tenure and/or having fan favorite status. Occasionally, rings are even given to fans as part of a charity raffle.New Orleans Saints raffle Super Bowl ring for Gulf spill charities, mnn.com; accessed November 12, 2014. A recent trend over the last 15‚Äì20 years has been lesser rings awarded to front office staff. These are commonly called \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" level rings and are smaller and contain fewer diamonds or contain faux diamonds. The first instance of this was the Redskins Super Bowl XVII ring when many in the front office received rings that were not solid gold and contained cubic zirconia stones (which resemble diamonds). When Tampa Bay won Super Bowl XXXVII, the players and coaches received rings with a diamond-centered Lombardi trophy. Some staff received rings with a metal Lombardi trophy and real diamonds surrounding the trophy and the \\"C\\" level ring did not contain any diamonds. The Toronto Raptors had five tiers of rings created to commemorate their 2019 NBA Championship, with 20 top tier rings (worth a reported $100,000 CAD or $150,000 CAD each) made for players and key staff, while 20,000 fifth tier replica rings (worth around $20 CAD each) were distributed to the audience at Scotiabank Arena during the Championship banner-raising ceremony at the 2019-20 season home opener. The ring manufacturer also makes replica rings, pendants, and other accessories derived from the championship ring design for sale to the general public. Manufacture L.G. Balfour of Attleboro, Massachusetts and Jostens of Minneapolis, Minnesota are the two companies that have produced the majority of championship rings for the four major professional sports leagues. Tiffany & Co. and Intergold (now a Jostens subsidiary) compete with Balfour, Baron and Jostens in the design and manufacturing of championship rings. Tiffany has been gaining momentum with NFL teams, having made the Buccaneers XXXVII, Giants XLII, Saints XLIV, Giants XLVI, and the Seahawks XLVIII rings. Recently, a new addition, Baron Championship Rings has gain momentum in the professional championship ring market, having designed and manufactured the 2016 NBA Champions Cleveland Cavaliers rings (at the time the heaviest NBA Championship ring ever made, weighing in at 165 grams and 105 pennyweights) and the 2019 NBA Champions Toronto Raptors (presently the largest ever championship ring). History and growth of trend The Montreal Hockey Club ordered the first championship rings for its players after winning the 1893 Stanley Cup championship, ordering rings resembling wedding bands with two crossed hockey sticks. Although several NHL teams ordered championship rings in the early 20th century, Stanley Cup-winning teams ordering championship rings did not become an annual custom in the NHL until the 1960s. The first World Series ring was given to the members of the New York Giants following their victory in the 1922 World Series over the New York Yankees. When the Yankees won the 1923 World Series, players were given a commemorative pocketwatch. The Yankees first gave rings to their players following the 1927 World Series. Rings became an annual tradition in the 1930s, as every World Series-winning team has given rings to its players since 1932. Prior to the first World Series- championship ring, baseball players in the early 20th century often requested other items in place of rings, including cufflinks and tie bars. Prior to the 1922 World Series, players on the World Series-winning team were given keepsakes, such as a pin or pocketwatch fob. Frankie Crosetti and Tommy Henrich requested shotguns from the Yankees following World Series championships. Grover Cleveland Alexander reportedly pawned his 1926 World Series ring. In professional sports leagues‚Äîsuch as the NFL and MLB‚Äîrings are also awarded to the team that lost the championship game (e.g., Super Bowl) or series (e.g., World Series), because that team is the champion of their conference (e.g., AFC or NFC in the NFL) or league (AL or NL in MLB). In recent years, it has become common for American and Canadian high schools to give championship rings to teams that win the state or provincial championship in their given sport, usually football. 1969 New York Mets World Champion team In North American racing series like the NASCAR Sprint Cup or IndyCar Series, rings are presented for a championship win, as well as wins in the most prestigious individual races of the schedule (such as the Daytona 500, Coca-Cola 600 or Indy 500). In American college basketball, championship rings are given to the team that wins the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship. Final Four rings are given to the other three teams in the Final Four. Value and resale The earliest championship rings for major professional sports were relatively plain, featuring only a few diamonds or other precious stones (in setting or mounting). However since then they have been increasing larger and more expensive with more intricate designs, especially from the 1990s onward, so a typical championship ring now contains over a hundred diamonds (besides the mounting, diamonds will placed on the bezel, shoulders, and even the hoop of the ring) which would be worth tens of thousands of dollars. This parallels the North American major professional sports leagues' growth in businesses and viewership, along with athletes' increasing salaries and endorsements, in contrast to the 1970s and earlier where professional athletes worked another job in the off-season. As some professional sports leagues have become more competitive and dynasties are fewer, winning even one title is \\"a source of pride for the team, because you never know if you‚Äôre going to win another one. It could be a one and only‚Äù. Hence, the 2016 NBA Champions Cleveland Cavaliers (who broke the city's 52 year drought of pro sports championships) and the 2019 NBA Champions Toronto Raptors (who wanted to reflect that it was not just Toronto's, but Canada's first NBA championship) commissioned some of the largest rings to commemorate their titles. Genuine championship rings are popular sports memorabilia/collectibles that can fetch tens of thousands of dollars at auction. Dave Meggett is known to have placed his ring for sale on eBay. Two Super Bowl rings from the 1970s Steelers sold on eBay for over $32,000 apiece in mid-2008. Patriots safety Je'Rod Cherry raffled his ring from Super Bowl XXXVI in November 2008 to benefit several charities working to help children in Africa and Asia. Tight end Shannon Sharpe, meanwhile, gave his first Super Bowl ring to his brother Sterling, who had his career cut short by injury. In 2011, a Super Bowl ring belonging to Steve Wright, a lineman for the Green Bay Packers in the 1960s, sold for over $73,000 at auction. Three Super Bowl rings belonging to former Raiders' great Ray Guy brought over $96,000 at auction. In 2012, Lawrence Taylor's son sold his father's 1990 Super Bowl ring for more than $250,000. In 2005, a minor international incident was caused when it was reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin had taken a Super Bowl ring from New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Kraft quickly issued a statement saying that he had given Putin the ring out of \\"respect and admiration\\" he had for the Russian people and Putin's leadership. Kraft later said his earlier statement was not true, and had been issued under pressure from the White House. The ring is on display at the Kremlin, along with other \\"gifts\\".Spokesman for Putin denies he stole Kraft's Super Bowl ring, profootballtalk.nbcsports.com, June 16, 2013. Outside North America Since only one championship trophy is awarded by the league to the winning team, championship rings are distributed as a collectible memento for the actual players and team officials to keep for themselves to symbolize the victory. Winners' medals (and runners-up medals) are not awarded in North American professional sports, in contrast to Olympic team sports and European club association football tournaments such as the Premier League and UEFA Champions League. The National Rugby League (NRL) ‚Äî the premier Australasian competition for rugby league football clubs ‚Äî also present rings for the players and coach of NRL Grand Final winning sides. After the 2004 NRL Grand Final which was won by the Bulldogs, one of their players, Johnathan Thurston gave his premiership ring to team-mate Steve Price who missed the decider due to injury. The Melbourne Storm were stripped of their premierships in 2007 and 2009, but the players involved in those premierships were still allowed to keep their premiership rings. In 2014 NRL premiership ring was worth $8000 made by Zed N Zed Jewellery. The winner of the Australian Supercross Championships also receives a championship ring. American Football teams in European leagues and competitions also produce championship rings, but they are usually made from more inexpensive material due to the lower budget of the teams. Circuiti Gioielli, an Italian designer of sports-themed jewelry, has issued custom made North American style rings to several champions like World SBK's Ben Spies and MXGP's Antonio Cairoli. These pieces were promotional vehicles for the jewelry and were not commissioned by a governing body or team. International events In addition to the medals commonly offered in international competition, some governing bodies have been known to gift their champions with commemorative rings. In ice hockey, the American, Canadian, Czech and Russian federations have used the practice in one or more occasions.

Having fallen on hard times during and post-Civil War, Holland sold the land to Alexander Mosely in 1871 for $6,760.47. Mosely was a 30-year-old farmer and Civil War veteran from Leon County and had a wife, Mary L. Moseley and a young son, William. During his 9 years on Woodlawn, Mosely would also become Leon County Sheriff. Mosely's new occupation led to the Mosely's selling Woodlawn and moving to Tallahassee. In 1880 Mosely sold Woodlawn to Eugene H. Smith, a storekeeper from Thomasville, Georgia for $4000. Smith then renamed the property Hickory Hill. The Smiths lived at Hickory Hill for 15 years before Mrs. Eugene Smith sold the property.Bauer, Robin Theresa, Master's Thesis, Department of History, Florida State University, 2005 In 1895 Hickory Hill was purchased for $8000 by Edward Beadle of New York City and became a quail hunting plantation called Tall Timbers Plantation. It would be passed down to Beadle's nephew and then later become the property of Tall Timbers Research Station and Land Conservancy.

Jock Mahoney had appeared as the villain in the previous Tarzan film, Tarzan the Magnificent.  Synopsis  Tarzan is called to India to save three hundred elephants, that will be drowned if a dam is opened to create a man- made lake to power an electric plant. Tarzan is pitted against two engineers who ignore the catastrophic results their work will create. The film also stars Indian Bollywood actors Feroz Khan, Simi Garewal and Murad in pivotal roles. It was followed by Tarzan's Three Challenges (1963) which was set in Thailand.

The tenth tropical cyclone and eighth named storm of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season, Hanna formed through the complex interaction of a surface trough, a tropical wave, and an upper-level low pressure system, a disturbance in the upper atmosphere. Designated a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on September 12, the storm remained disorganized throughout its duration, though it attained tropical storm status and a peak intensity of , with winds of 60 miles per hour (100 km/h). Hanna crossed extreme southeastern Louisiana, and made a second landfall along the Alabama-Mississippi border. Because most of the associated convective activity was east of the center of circulation, Louisiana and Mississippi received minimal damage. However, on Dauphin Island, Alabama, the storm caused coastal flooding which closed roads and forced the evacuation of residents. Florida received high wind gusts, heavy rainfall, and strong surf that resulted in the deaths of three swimmers. 20,000 homes in the state lost electricity. The heavy rainfall progressed into Georgia, where significant flooding occurred. Crop damage was extensive, and about 335 structures were damaged by the flooding. The storm caused a total of about $20 million (2002 USD; $23.96 million 2008 USD) in damage. Meteorological history A broad surface trough extended from the western Atlantic Ocean into the Gulf of Mexico in early September 2002. At the same time, a westward-moving tropical wave entered the gulf on September 10 and spawned a weak low along the trough, with little associated thunderstorm activity. On September 11, an upper-level low over the United States moved into the Gulf and became cut off from the flow, allowing atmospheric convection to develop to the east of the tropical wave. The surface low organized, and convection formed closer to the center of the low. At 0000 UTC on September 12, a Hurricane Hunters aircraft was able to find a well-defined center of circulation; the National Hurricane Center (NHC) thus designated it a tropical depression while it was about south of Pensacola, Florida. After being designated, the cyclone became disorganized, and contained little deep and persistent convection; with dry air infringing on the western edge of the storm, substantial intensification was deemed unlikely. Despite being sheared, the cyclone neared tropical storm status later that day, though it remained a depression due to a partially non- tropical appearance. Initially, the depression meandered towards the northeast due to weak steering currents, and it intensified into a tropical storm at 0600 UTC. As such, it was named Hanna by the National Hurricane Center. Over the next 24 hours, the low-level center rotated around the mid- and upper- level centers, and the entire tropical storm turned southwestward by late September 12. After a jog to the northwest, the low-level center became separated from the convection. Meandering, the storm started to turn northward under the steering currents of a southwesterly flow associated with an approaching mid-level trough. Hanna then strengthened sharply to reach to its peak intensity of 60 miles per hour (100 km/h) at 0000 UTC on September 14. Convection shifted towards the eastern semicircle of the circulation, while the still-exposed center became malformed and elongated. On September 14, the poorly organized cyclone crossed southeastern Louisiana, turned towards the north-northeast and made a second landfall close to the Alabama-Mississippi border at 1500 UTC that day, still at its peak strength. The storm dissipated rapidly as it proceeded inland, and the remnant low pressure area moved into Georgia and South Carolina. Preparations alt=Satellite image of a large area of clouds over the Gulf of Mexico, elongated from upper-right to bottom- left. Shortly after the formation of the storm, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm watch for the coastal area between Pascagoula, Mississippi and the Suwannee River in Florida. A tropical storm warning for the region between Grand Isle, Louisiana and Apalachicola, Florida replaced the watch, though it was discontinued east of Apalachicola. All tropical cyclone warnings and watches were discontinued by 1800 UTC on September 14, as there was no longer a need for the advisories. After the landfall, officials issued flood watches for inland parts of Mississippi and Alabama as well as for western portions of Georgia and the Carolinas. On Dauphin Island in Alabama, some residents boarded up windows and filled sandbags provided by local fire departments to prepare for Hanna. The Red Cross opened 10 shelters throughout the Gulf Coast region. Impact The total damage caused by Tropical Storm Hanna amounted to about $20 million--equivalent to $23 million in 2008 USD. U.S. Gulf Coast alt=Map of rainfall totals from tropical storm. The map is focused primarily on the Southeast U.S. In Louisiana, damage was light, as the majority of Hanna's convective activity was to the east. Rainfall was mostly less than 1 inches (25 mm), and little rise in tide was reported. Little or no damage occurred in neighboring Mississippi, where similar effects were reported. Damage was greater in Alabama, where rain reached at Coden and at Belle Fontaine. Sustained winds of were reported at Dauphin Island, with gusts up to . The lowest barometric pressure was also at Dauphin Island; it reportedly fell to 1005 mb. Storm tides of caused minor coastal flooding and beach erosion in some areas, including along the causeway that crosses the Mobile Bay. One tornado, an F0 on the Fujita Scale, touched down in south Mobile County, knocking down trees. Some residents were left without electric power, and there was flooding on both ends of Dauphin Island, leading to road closures. The storm forced the evacuation of some residents on the western end of the island. In addition to the heavy rains, trees were downed in parts of Baldwin County. In Florida, peak gusts were recorded at near Pensacola Beach. The winds, combined with associated thunderstorms, caused minor damage, and brought down small trees and power lines. Throughout Walton County, Hanna left approximately 15,000 customers without power, forming a statewide total of 20,000 power outages. Due to high winds, bridges to offshore islands were closed. Minor beach erosion was reported along the coast of Walton, Bay and Gulf counties. Three people drowned in high surf; one near Pensacola Beach, one at Seagrove Beach and another at Panama City Beach. The fatalities prompted a local Police Major to comment, \\"People are getting into the water and not paying attention to the warning flags.\\" Heavy rain fell throughout the central and western Panhandle; the highest reported total was , at Chipley. As a result, rivers topped their banks, while county roads and homes in Perry, as well as streets in the Tallahassee region, were flooded. The total damage in Florida is estimated at $400,000 (2002 USD). Eastern United States Hanna dropped heavy rainfall across much of Georgia, peaking at at Donalsonville, at Carrollton, and at Embry. Although the heaviest rainfall was mostly confined to southwestern parts of the state, precipitation was widespread within a northwest-northeast feeder band over central and northern Georgia. Associated with the band was up to of rainfall in a matter of hours, as well as gusty thunderstorms. The highest rainfall totals from this individual band were limited to an area north of a line from Atlanta to Athens. The heavy rainfall helped to relieve a persistent drought, bringing vegetation back to life. However, climatologists determined that the rainfall did not fully alleviate the dry conditions. The band of thunderstorms produced gusts of , downing trees and power lines. In the Atlanta metropolitan area, 48,000 customers received power outages. The winds tore a roof off a house and damaged a number of mobile homes. The heavy rainfall caused severe flooding; in Donalsonville, 250 houses and 50 businesses suffered water damage, while another 35 were damaged in nearby Miller County. Roads were flooded, including parts of U.S. Route 27. Crop damage was significant in the state. According to the Georgia Farm Services Agency, $19 million (2002 USD; $22 million 2008 USD) in damage to cotton and peanut crops were reported. Due to the flooding and damage, Governor Roy Barnes declared Seminole, Miller and Decatur counties federal disaster areas. Moderate to heavy rain extended as far north as the Carolinas, and light showers reached the Delmarva Peninsula. Locations in western South Carolina picked up around 3 inches (75 mm) of rainfall, causing flooding on some roads and highways. Various streams and ponds topped their banks, and flood waters on some roads reached an estimated deep. On South Carolina Highway 20, a motorist became stranded in high waters, and nearby houses were damaged. The rainfall delayed a football game at Williams-Brice Stadium for about 50 minutes. Farther northward, the remnants of Tropical Storm Hanna contributed to around 1 inch (25 mm) of rainfall in New England, particularly in Vermont.

He was first credited as associate producer of the 1967 Matt Helm (Dean Martin) movie The Ambushers which involved a US-government built flying saucer.  Biography  Between 1970 and 1975 Netter was the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer at MGM Studios. It was a controversial period at the studio with many filmmakers unhappy with the treatment they received from Netter and studio president James Aubrey. In 1975 he produced the Dean Martin crime movie Mr. Ricco, and in 1978 was co-producer of the African mercenary movie The Wild Geese. The next year he began a period when he concentrated on the Western genre, producing The Sacketts, a TV miniseries based on Louis L'Amour's Sackett family and serving as executive producer of the NBC TV movie Buffalo Soldiers. Over the next two years he also executive produced Wild Times and L'Amour's The Cherokee Trail. 1987 saw Netter's first involvement with J. Michael Straczynski, when he was producer of Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future that was story-edited and partially written by Straczynski, after which he was executive producer of the Babylon 5 TV series and various spin-offs (sharing equal executive producer credit with Straczynski). A still photo of Netter shows him portraying the Babylon 5 character of Earth Alliance President Luis Santiago (The A-Z Guide to Babylon 5, ). Between the third and fourth seasons of Babylon 5, he founded and appointed himself CEO of Netter Digital, a CGI special effects company. Netter Digital then replaced Foundation Imaging as the special effects studio for the series, doing all the CGI work for the final season of that show, as well as several of the Babylon 5 telefilms, and did all the effects for its short- lived spinoff, Crusade. He was also an executive producer for the only season of Hypernauts in 1996. With the cancellation of Crusade in 1999, Netter Digital lost its only client. Unable to promptly replace it with other customers, the company went out of business in 2000. In 2006, Netter began executive producing Babylon 5: The Lost Tales, the latest venture set in the Babylon 5 universe. The direct-to-DVD publication was released on July 31, 2007.

Irving Aaronson, redhotjazz.com Aaronson co-wrote a hit song, \\"Boo-Hoo-Hoo\\", in 1921. His first band was called the Crusaders and recorded several sides for Edison Records. His band signed with the Victor label in 1926 and the band name was changed to Irving Aaronson and his Commanders. While signed to Victor from 1926 to 1929 the band had a notable success with \\"Let's Misbehave\\" in 1927. The band appeared in Cole Porter's Broadway musical Paris, in 1928 and broadcast on KFWB, Hollywood, California, circa 1929.Sies, Luther F. (2014). Encyclopedia of American Radio, 1920-1960, 2nd Edition, Volume 1. McFarland & Company, Inc. . P. 9. In 1935, Aaronson starred in the Irving Aaronson Orchestra radio program on NBC. The band toured movie theatres and ballrooms across the US before calling it quits in the mid-1930s, at which time Aaronson went to work as a musical director for MGM studios. He remained there in that capacity and as assistant to producer Joe Pasternak until his death from a heart attack in 1963. Aaronson's band included at various times musicians such as Phil Saxe, Joe Gillespie, and others who would become band leaders themselves: Artie Shaw, Gene Krupa and Tony Pastor. Western movie actor Fuzzy Knight was a drummer with Aaronson's band in the late 1920s. Aaronson's most popular song, \\"The Loveliest Night of the Year\\", was not recorded with his band but was adapted by Aaronson in 1950 for the Mario Lanza film The Great Caruso. When Aaronson was 45 years old, his musician career had faded, but Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios hired him as a musical supervisor. Less notable appearance on television include his voicing of Mr. Nobody in the MGM's animation Betty Boop for President. Some sources suggest his retirement at age 65, others have him active until his death. Personal life and final years Aaronson died in Hollywood of a heart attack in 1963, at 68 years old.

Four of those injured were in serious condition. On January 13, 2006, Koptsev was charged with racially motivated attempted murder and humiliation of a religious group.

On February 28, 2006, Koptsev pleaded not guilty of attempting to murder Jewish worshipers at a synagogue. The official charge against him was attempted murder \\"motivated by racial hatred\\", a charge that is rarely brought in Russian courts. Investigators found anti-semitic pamphlets in his home, but insist that he was acting alone. He has been diagnosed with a schizophrenic disorder, but prosecutors said he was still fit to stand trial. On March 27, 2006, Koptsev was sentenced to 13 years in prison and mandatory psychiatric treatment after being found guilty of attempted murder. On April 4, 2006, Koptsev's lawyer, Vladimir Kirsanov, appealed to Russia's Supreme Court to have his client's sentence reduced, arguing he was mentally unstable, did not kill anyone, and did not cause any disabling injuries.

In 1878 Laroy S. Starrett invented and patented the first combination square, and in 1880 he founded the L.S. Starrett Company in Athol, MA in order to produce it and other precision tools. In 1882, Starrett traveled to London and Paris to appoint sales representatives, thereby starting up the international marketing of his products. In 1887, Starrett acquired further patents. In 1890, L.S. Starrett patented a micrometer with other improvements, transforming the rough version of this tool into a modern micrometer. During the same year Starrett began making and refining saw blades, and continues to be a major manufacturer as of 2015. In 1895 Starrett patented the divider with trammel. In 1920, the company added its first gauge to the product line and quickly became the world‚Äôs largest innovator and maker of precision calibrators. Between 1941 and 1945, Starrett increased its production by 800% and won the Army- Navy ‚ÄúE‚Äù Award. At the same time, more than 400 employees went into the US armed forces. The post-war period was a time of overseas expansion, with Starrett opening a factory in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, in 1956. In the early 1970s, the Brazilian factory was moved to a new location in the city of Itu, 100 km from S√£o Paulo. In 1958, a plant was opened in Scotland and this plant currently makes products for the European and Asian markets. In 1962, Starrett acquired the Webber Gage Company, adding gauge blocks to the Starrett product line. In 1970, Starrett took over the Herman Stone Co., a granite product maker, and in 1985 it relocated production to a new plant in Mount Airy, NC. This plant also makes saws and measuring equipment. In 1986, Starrett took over the Evans Rule Company, the world's largest tape measure manufacturer, and in 1990 the company bought Sigma Optical, a British manufacturer of optical profile projectors. In 1998, Starrett expanded into China, opening a new plant in Suzhou.Synthenet Corporation (2006), Starrett.[online]. Available at: (Accessed 9 April 2010). In 2002, a former Starrett subcontractor alerted US Defense Department investigators to an alleged fraud issue with a Starrett RapidCheck Coordinate Measuring Machine that Starrett had to replace free-of- charge to customers because of a fault. Federal agents raided Starrett's North Carolina plant looking for evidence of fraud. The federal investigation was terminated in December 2003 with no charges filed.Hoover‚Äôs Profiles, The L.S. Starrett Company. [Online]. Available at: http://www.answers.com/topic/the-l- s-starrett-company (Accessed 4 July 2010) In 2005, Starrett stopped manufacturing Coordinate Measuring Machines when it sold the CMM product division to the company Sheffield Measurement. In 2006, L.S. Starrett Co. purchased Tru-Stone Technologies Inc. in Waite Park, Minn., a Minnesota maker of custom-engineered granite machine bases, for $19.8 million in cash.

The name means \\"keyboard writing\\" in Esperanto. It differs from conventional music notation in a number of ways and is intended to be easily readable. History Cornelis Pot came from a family of shipbuilders and was managing director of Smit Slikkerveer, a factory which made dynamos for ships. He had also a passion for music and wanted to others to be able to enjoy music by playing and by singing. He studied alternative music notations and from them developed his idea of Klavarskribo. He expected the music world to embrace his invention but was disappointed when that proved not to be the case. Having the financial means, Pot was able by himself to start and publish written courses and have music transcribed. In the 1930s the number of klavar users grew enormously and much sheet music was transcribed and published in the klavar notation. During World War II these activities stopped, but afterwards Pot started with a new √©lan. His Klavarskribo Institute expanded so much as to employ fifty people at one time. Courses in English, French and German were offered. The Klavarskribo Foundation was established after Pot‚Äôs death in 1977 in Ridderkerk (near Rotterdam) with limited financial means. The foundation is concerned with transcribing and publishing music mainly for church organists, an important supportive group. Also written courses for a number of instruments, including guitar, accordion, recorder and in particular piano, and other keyboard instruments, are available. There are more than 10,000 klavar notation users in the Netherlands and abroad. Notation A keyboard with the stave growing out of it A melody with the note stems pointing to the right, indicating that the right hand should be used A measure in three-time with bar lines and count lines The klavar notation distinguishes itself from conventional notation in several ways. The stave on which the notes are written is vertical so the music is read from top to bottom. Each note has its own individual position, low notes on the left and high notes on the right as on the piano. This stave consists of groups of two and three vertical lines corresponding to the black keys (notes) of the piano. White notes are written in the seven white spaces between the lines. Therefore sharps and flats are no longer needed, as each note has its own place in the octave. The evident correspondence between the stave and a piano induced Pot to use the name Klavarskribo. Though the klavar notation is a universal notation that can be used for all instruments and for singing, its greatest advantage is for instruments where a number of notes have to be played simultaneously: the keyboard instruments. Duration and rhythm are shown graphically. A piece of music is divided into bars of equal length, which are subdivided into ‚Äúcounts‚Äù or beats. Short horizontal bar lines show the division between the bars, dotted lines indicate the counts. All notes are provided with stems‚Äîstems to the right: play with the right hand, stems to the left: left hand. These are placed so as to indicate in the measuring system exactly when a note must be played or sung. A note always lasts till the next one of the same hand or part appears, unless a stop sign or continuation dot is used. Therefore there is no connection between shape or colour of a note and its duration. The various kinds of 'rest' signs, different note heads, ties and different clefs are thus rendered unnecessary. The klavar notation uses one clef: the centre of the keyboard is indicated by dotted lines representing C and D, so Middle C can easily be located. There are no different clefs for the left and right hand. This design enables the player to see clearly, after a short explanation, how the notation 'works', so that a beginner can start playing almost immediately. The player can see exactly which note or chord to play and which hand to use. Klavar is not only for beginners; even difficult pieces by Chopin and Liszt are available in the klavar notation. The Klavarskribo Foundation has transcribed more than 25,000 pieces and provides catalogues for the piano, reed organ, accordion, orchestra, electronic organ, keyboard and guitar. In addition to transcription, the PC software KlavarScript enables music in the traditional notation to be transcribed to the klavar notation through MIDI files, scanning, or playing through a MIDI keyboard. Organizations In the Netherlands the Klavarskribo Foundation and the Klavar Vereniging Nederland (Dutch Klavar Union) are the two main organizations. The latter, active since 1978, has 800 members and its objective is, in cooperation with the Foundation, to promote and preserve the klavar notation. The Union keeps a register of teachers in the Netherlands who are willing to teach the klavar system. It tries to stimulate klavar users to take lessons from these teachers in order to improve their level of playing. Both the Klavarskribo Foundation and the Dutch Klavar Union consider it their task to point out to those who wish to make music, or who are starting to do so, the advantages of using the klavar notation. In the UK, the Klavar Music Foundation of Great Britain promotes the use of klavar notation and has been in operation since 1976 as an Educational Trust and a Charity registered with the Charity Commission, number 272510. It ceased to exist in May 2018 UK charity commission.

He was one of the most successful motorcycle racing tuners and race team crew chiefs of the 1970s through the early 2000s, working with motorcycle racers who won two national championships and six world championships. He is best known for his association with motorcycle racers Gary Nixon and Freddie Spencer. __TOC__ Motorcycling career Kanemoto was born in Utah and grew up on a farm near San Jose, California. He began boat racing at the age of 15 then switched to tuning karts raced by his sister. He was hired as a race mechanic by Kawasaki in 1968 and became known for his partnership with motorcycle racer Gary Nixon when they won the 1973 U.S. Road Racing National Championship aboard a temperamental and brutally fast Kawasaki KR750 with a three cylinder, two- stroke engine. The duo competed at the international level in the 1976 Formula 750 championship, laying claim to the Formula 750 world championship until international politics denied them that prize. When Nixon retired in 1979, Kanemoto joined a young up and coming road racer named Freddie Spencer and won the U.S. 250cc Road Racing National Championship with a Yamaha. He spent the 1980 season with Spencer before moving to Europe in 1981 to be a Yamaha mechanic for former 500cc world champion Barry Sheene. Kanemoto is perhaps best known for the world championships won with Spencer for the Honda Grand Prix team in 1983 and 1985 when Spencer accomplished the double by winning both the 250cc and the 500cc Road Racing World Championships in the same year, a feat that will never be repeated due to the discontinuation of the 250cc and 500cc classes in current MotoGP competition. He joined forces with Eddie Lawson in 1989 to win another 500cc World Championship for Honda. Kanemoto also won 250cc World Championships for Honda in 1991 and 1992 with Luca Cadalora as the rider, and in 1997 with Max Biaggi as the rider.

During his priestly ministry in the Diocese of Allentown, Kurtz served as a high school and college teacher, an administrator, and a pastor in Catasauqua and Bethlehem. He was raised to the rank of Monsignor in 1986. Prior to becoming Archbishop (with his brother's death) he had a close bond with his brother George. George would have a large impact on him and his church community forming relationships with staff and parishioners. Episcopacy Bishop of Knoxville On October 26, 1999, Kurtz was appointed the second Bishop of Knoxville, Tennessee, by Pope John Paul II.

It can be considered a precursor to the operating system.Introduction to Operating Systems 000.18/018, Johns Hopkins University Computer Science Department The name is derived from a program which is always present in the computer's memory, thus being \\"resident\\". Because memory was very limited on those systems, the resident monitor was often little more than a stub that would gain control at the end of a job and load a non-resident portion to perform required job cleanup and setup tasks. On a general-use computer using punched card input, the resident monitor governed the machine before and after each job control card was executed, loaded and interpreted each control card, and acted as a job sequencer for batch processing operations.\\"59.305 - Operating Systems, Massey University The resident monitor could clear memory from the last used program (with the exception of itself), load programs, search for program data and maintain standard input-output routines in memory. Similar system software layers were typically in use in the early days of the later minicomputers and microcomputers before they gained the power to support full operating systems.Operating Systems - Lecture 02, University of Auckland  Current use  Resident monitor functionality is present in many embedded systems, boot loaders, and various embedded command lines. The original functions present in all resident monitors are augmented with present-day functions dealing with boot time hardware, disks, ethernet, wireless controllers, etc. Typically, these functions are accessed using a serial terminal or a physical keyboard and display, if attached. Such a resident monitor is frequently called a debugger, boot loader, command-line interface (CLI), etc. The original meaning of serial-accessed or terminal-accessed resident monitor is not frequently used, although the functionality remained the same, and was augmented. Typical functions of a resident monitor include examining and editing ram and/or ROM (including flash EEPROM) and sometimes special function registers, the ability to jump into code at a specified address, the ability to call code at a given address, the ability to fill an address range with a constant such as 0x00, and several others. More advanced functions include local disassembly to processor assembly language instructions, and even assembly and writing into flash memory from code typed by the operator. Also, code can be downloaded and uploaded from various sources, and some advanced monitors support tftp, ftp, http etc networking as well as formatting and reading FAT and other filesystems, typically from flash attached memory on USB or CFcard buses. For embedded processors, many \\"in-circuit debuggers\\" with software-only mode use resident monitor concepts and functions that are frequently accessed by a GUI IDE. They are not different from the traditionally serial line accessed resident monitor command lines, but users are not aware of this. At the latest, developers and advanced users will discover these low level embedded resident monitor functions when writing low level API code on a host to communicate with an embedded target for debugging and code test case running. Several current microcontrollers have resident serial monitors or extended boot loaders available as options to be used by developers. Many are open source. Some examples are PAULMON2PAULMON2, AVR DebugMonitorAVR DebugMonitor and the Bamo128 Arduino boot loader and monitorBamo128 Arduino boot loader and monitor. In general, most current resident monitors for embedded computing can be compiled according to various memory constraints, from small and minimalistic, to large, filling up to 25% of the code space available on an AVR ATmega328 processor with 32 kilobytes of flash memory, for example. In many cases resident monitors can be a step up from \\"printf debugging\\" and are very helpful when developing on a budget that does not allow a proper hardware in-circuit debugger (ICD) to be used.

The station broadcasts with 50,000 watts of power from an antenna located Northeast of the intersection of Gratiot Avenue and Fourteen Mile Road in Clinton Charter Township, Macomb County, Michigan, and directs its signal mainly toward the north and east to avoid interfering with WWWW-FM in Ann Arbor. WDKL is owned by the Educational Media Foundation and is also licensed for HD Radio service, carrying Air1 and K-Love Classics on its subchannels.https://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?latitude=42.322261810303&longitude;=-83.176307678223 HD Radio Guide for Detroit WBRB (AM) broadcast on the frequency of 1430 kHz, before leaving the air permanently in 1990.https://www.facebook.com/makemacombyourhome/posts/throwback-thursday- wbrb-am-1430-the-voice-of-macomb-county/743657465764291/ History WBRB- AM-FM WDKL began life on November 6, 1960, as WBRB-FM, the FM simulcast side of WBRB, also licensed to Mount Clemens and owned by Malrite Communications Group. For years, WBRB (\\"The Voice of Macomb County\\") was a full-service radio station targeting Macomb County with local and ABC Information Network news, weather and information and middle-of-the-road music. During non-simulcast dayparts, WBRB-FM aired Beautiful Music programming and some country music as well. It was truly a very local station, reporting news from local police blotters, politics and the county school districts. Even local obituaries were read every Sunday morning on the AM side. In the 1970s, Charlie Park was the station manager and owner of the station. Those who worked there at the time included Marv Welch, John Cwikla, Mark Andrews, Roseanne Cerra and Dave Wagner. Eventually, ownership of the AM and FM portions of WBRB was separated, and Gilda Radner and her brother Michael took control of the AM station. WBRB briefly became WWHK with an adult standards format in the 1980s, then fell silent for a time and returned to the air in 1985 with another attempt at its original full service Adult Contemporary/Oldies format. The second try at a full-service format ultimately failed and the station was sold and became a Motivational Talk outlet before falling silent for good in January 1990. The WBRB transmitter was moved to Garden City and pressed into service at WCAR, which had been a Malrite-owned sister station of WBRB/WBRB-FM in the 1960s first as WERB and then as WTAK. The original WBRB studio and transmitter location on Gratiot Avenue in Clinton Township are now occupied by a Salvation Army thrift store. WBRB radio station on Gratiot Avenue in Clinton Township, circa 1977 WLBS/WKSG In Spring 1979, WBRB was sold to Inner City Broadcasting, owners of New York's legendary WBLS, and switched to a disco and jazz format, and changed its calls to WLBS as 102.7 WLBS (complete with a logo similar to that of WBLS). WLBS during its disco phase was programmed by WBLS' Frankie Crocker. The station evolved into urban contemporary by 1981, but success was limited due to the station's radio signals inability to successfully reach to Detroit from Mt. Clemens. The Urban Contemporary format was solid, but the weak signal prohibited the station's success. The local stations in Detroit of a similar format pounced on this weakness. Urban competitors such as WJLB and former Top 40 station WDRQ in the market took the lead. Leadership in New York called for a change and the station changed to a \\"Rock of the '80s\\"-style new wave music format in 1983. This format was groundbreaking and innovative thanks to the Music Director, Robin Yarborough, who introduced many New Wave artists to the area. Limited success followed, but again signal limitations were a big problem. During the \\"new wave\\" format, WLBS air personalities included now legendary San Diego radio man Mike \\"Happy\\" Halloran, Jason Slaughter, Sergio Dean (of WBLS New York), Pat Edwards, Tim Dugan, Francis Tinsley, Gerald McBride and Terri McCormick. In August 1984, WLBS flipped from New Wave to CHR/Top 40 using a format co-developed by consultant Lee Abrams. The station was a weak competitor of hit-music format leaders WCZY and WHYT, and so after only three months, the station changed its call letters and moniker to WKSG, Kiss 102.7, and adopted a 1950s-1970s oldies format called \\"Kiss of Gold\\" developed by veteran Detroit programmer Paul Christy.https://www.mcrfb.com/?p=20431 Motor City Radio Flashbacks With broadcasters such as Christy, Johnny Molson, and Detroit radio legend Lee Alan (who hosted a syndicated show called Back in the '60s Again), and despite competition in the format from WHND, WMTG, and CKLW- FM in the late 1980s, WKSG did well until WOMC changed its format from Adult Contemporary to Oldies in 1989. CD102.7/Z-Rock In April 1991, WKSG became WXCD, CD102.7, \\"Detroit's Smooth Sounds,\\" with a new age/smooth jazz format, which returned the format to the Detroit airwaves after WVAE had changed to become WMXD in late 1989. The new age format barely registered at all in the ratings, and less than a year later, in March 1992, WXCD became WDZR, airing ABC Radio's satellite-fed Z-Rock format of hard rock and heavy metal. With a playlist that rocked harder than more established AOR outlets WRIF and WLLZ, WDZR achieved decent ratings for a time, but in 1996, ABC, having acquired the assets of Satellite Music Network, discontinued the Z-Rock format. 102.7 The Bear In November 1996, WDZR changed its calls to WWBR, 102.7 The Bear, \\"Detroit's Rock Animal,\\" keeping the hard-rock format but transitioning to a local air staff with Ted Nugent as morning personality. \\"The Bear\\" eventually evolved into a \\"Classic Rock That Really Rocks\\" outlet to compete with softer-edged classic-rock competitor WCSX. The end of \\"The Bear\\" came on January 16, 1999, following the station's sale from Allur Detroit to Radio One. At 6:33 p.m., after playing The Doors' \\"When The Music's Over\\" (the same song that ended the legendary WABX rock format in 1984), the station went silent for nearly 20 minutes and then emerged as an Adult Contemporary station. Kiss 102.7 The first song played was \\"Just Another Day\\" by Jon Secada. They also revived the \\"Kiss-FM\\" brand name as \\"The New 102.7 Kiss FM, with the Best Variety of Light Rock from the 80's, 90's and Today\\". The station also picked up Delilah Rene's syndicated nightly request program. The station requested the new calls WKSK, but went with WDMK (\\"Detroit Michigan's Kiss\\") after failing to secure its first choice. Then, on August 28, 1999, WDMK shifted to an Urban Adult Contemporary format to compete with powerhouse WMXD, retaining the \\"Kiss\\" name. The fact that the mainstream AC format lasted only eight months led some to believe that Radio One had always planned to shift the station's format in an R&B; direction and used the AC format as a smokescreen to catch WMXD off guard. As Kiss 102.7, \\"Detroit's Adult R&B; Station,\\" WDMK remained low in the ratings until October 2002, when the station shifted its format to Rhythmic Oldies and hired away longtime WJLB personality and Detroit Pistons announcer John Mason to do the morning show. The change brought 102.7 its highest ratings in years, and listeners also welcomed the musical shift to more \\"old school\\" R&B; as opposed to current hits by neo-soul artists which could already be heard on other stations in the market. Hot 102-7 Former logo of WHTD On June 25, 2005, at 3 a.m., Radio One swapped the formats of WDMK and its mainstream urban-formatted sister station WDTJ 105.9 Jamz. The WDMK calls and \\"old school\\" format were moved to 105.9, with the \\"old school\\" format evolving into a very gold-based Urban AC. Also making the switch was John Mason, who was switched to afternoon drive at the new 105.9 Kiss-FM as the popular syndicated Tom Joyner morning show also moved to 105.9 from WMXD. 102.7 took on the mainstream urban format and new calls WHTD and moniker Hot 102-7. On April 19, 2007, HOT 102-7 re-branded itself as HOT1027Detroit.com (now HotHipHopDetroit.com) while re-launching its website to focus merging newer interactive technologies with traditional radio. They, along with KBXX, were Radio One's first stations to re-brand themselves with a new corporate initiative. The station was among the first in Detroit to use text messaging for radio contests (text-to-win instead of call- in-to-win). They also added podcasting features, instant messaging to the on- air personality, live chats and other features to the website. Ratings remained roughly the same, but website traffic grew close to those of its competitors. For a brief period in 2007, the station carried the syndicated afternoon show The Wendy Williams Experience, and Wendy hosted her first Dons & Divas Party outside of New York City in Detroit that same year. In April 2009, WHTD dropped the \\"Detroit.com\\" portion of their moniker, and reverted to just \\"Hot 102-7.\\" Praise 102.7 Praise logo, 2011-18 On October 21, 2011, Radio One announced that they will begin operating WGPR, a station owned by a local Freemasons group, effective immediately, under a local marketing agreement. On October 24, 2011, at Midnight, Radio One discarded the Urban AC format on WGPR. Two days later, Radio One moved the Urban Contemporary and \\"Hot\\" branding from WHTD to WGPR. WHTD became Urban gospel as Praise 102.7 on October 31, 2011 at Midnight. The call letters on 102.7 changed from WHTD to WPZR at the same time as the format switch. The WHTD calls are now located at an AM station in Toccoa, Georgia. On May 1, 2018, Urban One announced that they had sold WPZR to the Educational Media Foundation for $12.7 million and three translators. EMF then announced its intentions to flip the station to its K-Love network upon the sale's closure. At that time, Urban One planned on pairing the three translators (which had not yet been specified in the announcement) acquired with their existing translator at 99.9 FM, W260CB, to create \\"The Detroit Praise Network\\", and continue the gospel programming via WDMK-HD2. W260CB had recently dropped its urban oldies format to simulcast WPZR. K-Love On August 9, 2018, WPZR changed their format from urban gospel (which moved to WDMK-HD2) to EMF's K-Love contemporary Christian format under new WDKL call letters.WPZR Completes Rebrand as Detroit Praise Network as EMF Closes 102.7 Purchase Radioinsight - August 9, 2018 Summer Jamz Since 1997, the \\"Beat\\" and later \\"Hot\\" hip-hop franchise (first WCHB-FM, then WHTD, and now WGPR) has hosted Detroit's signature annual hip hop/R&B; summer concert called Summer Jamz. At its peak as a free event during the first eight years, Summer Jamz attracted crowds of 20-30,000 people while located at Detroit's Hart Plaza. As a ticketed event in 2006, the event attracted over 15,000 at the Michigan State Fair. The 10th anniversary show in 2007, the station hosted Summer Jamz in Pontiac's, much smaller amphitheatre and played to a seated capacity crowd of nearly 4,000. The event, now in the hands of WGPR, is expected to return to Michigan State Fair's larger capacity venue for future shows.

OECD, 2017 Labour productivity US, Japan, Germany Workforce productivity is the amount of goods and services that a group of workers produce in a given amount of time. It is one of several types of productivity that economists measure. Workforce productivity, often referred to as labor productivity, is a measure for an organisation or company, a process, an industry, or a country. Workforce productivity is to be distinguished from employee productivity which is a measure employed at individual level based on the assumption that the overall productivity can be broken down to increasingly smaller units until, ultimately, to the individual employee, in order be used for example for the purpose of allocating a benefit or sanction based on individual performance (see also: Vitality curve). In 2002, the OECD defined it as \\"the ratio of a volume measure of output to a volume measure of input\\".OECD Manual: Measuring Productivity; Measurement of Aggregate and Industry-Level Productivity Growth. (2002) Volume measures of output are normally gross domestic product (GDP) or gross value added (GVA), expressed at constant prices i.e. adjusted for inflation. The three most commonly used measures of input are: # hours worked, typically from the OECD Annual National Accounts database # workforce jobs; and # number of people in employment.  Measurement  Workforce productivity can be measured in 2 ways, in physical terms or in price terms. * the intensity of labour-effort, and the quality of labour effort generally. * the creative activity involved in producing technical innovations. * the relative efficiency gains resulting from different systems of management, organization, co-ordination or engineering. * the productive effects of some forms of labour on other forms of labour. These aspects of productivity refer to the qualitative dimensions of labour input. If an organization is using labour much more intensely, one can assume it's due to greater labour productivity, since the output per labour-effort may be the same. This insight becomes particularly important when a large part of what is produced in an economy consists of services. Management may be very preoccupied with the productivity of employees, but the productivity gains of management itself is very difficult to prove. While labor productivity growth has been seen as a useful barometer of the U.S. economy‚Äôs performance, recent research has examined why U.S. labor productivity rose during the recent downturn of 2008‚Äì2009, when U.S. gross domestic product plummeted.Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, The Labor Productivity Puzzle, May 2012 The validity of international comparisons of labour productivity can be limited by a number of measurement issues.

Her third novel, it won the Booker Prize in the same year. The book explores the emotional restlessness of houseboat dwellers who live neither fully on the water nor fully on the land. It was inspired by the most difficult years of Fitzgerald's own life, years during which she lived on an old Thames sailing barge moored at Battersea Reach. Plot summary The novel, set in 1961, follows an eccentric community of houseboat owners whose permanently moored craft cluster together along the unsalubrious bank of the River Thames at Battersea Reach, London. Nenna, living aboard Grace with her two children Martha and Tilda, is obsessed with thoughts of her estranged husband Edward returning to her, while her children run wild on the muddy foreshore. Maurice, who lives next to her on a barge he has named Maurice, provides a sympathetic ear for her worries. He ekes out a precarious living as a male prostitute, bringing back men most evenings from the nearby pub, and allowing his boat to be used for the storage of stolen goods by his shadowy acquaintance, Harry. Willis, an elderly marine painter, lives aboard Dreadnought which he hopes to sell in spite of its serious leak. Woodie is a retired businessman living aboard Rochester during the summer and with his wife Janet in Purley during the winter. Richard, aboard his converted minesweeper Lord Jim, is looked up to as the unofficial leader of the community, both by temperament and by virtue of his past role with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. His wife Laura hankers to move to a permanent house ashore. When Dreadnought unexpectedly sinks, Willis is taken in by Woodie on Rochester. Nenna resists the entreaties of her prosperous and energetic sister, who tries to persuade her to move to Canada for the sake of her daughters, and she resolves to confront Edward in his rented room in Stoke Newington, north London. Failing to persuade him to return, she gets back to Grace late at night feeling desolate, and bumps into Richard who tells her that his wife has just left him. They spend the night together. Richard discovers Harry acting suspiciously on Maurice. Harry attacks him, and Richard ends up in hospital. Laura takes her husband's incapacity as the excuse she needs to sell Lord Jim and to move herself and Richard into a proper house. Maurice sits out an overnight storm in his cabin, drinking whisky in the dark. He hears blundering footsteps overhead and discovers that Edward (whom he does not know) has returned, incapably drunk, trying to find Nenna. The storm has blown away the gangplank between Maurice and Grace and, almost delirious with drink, the two men climb down Maurices fixed ladder, intending somehow to cross the wild water between the two boats. As they cling to the ladder, Maurices anchor is wrenched from the mud, its mooring ropes part, and the boat puts out on the tide. Principal characters * Nenna James, Canadian, with two children (Martha, 12 and Tilda, 6) living aboard Grace * Edward, her estranged husband, now living in north London * Richard Blake and his wife Laura, living aboard Lord Jim * Sam Willis, an elderly marine painter, living aboard Dreadnought * Maurice, a male prostitute, living aboard Maurice * Woodie, a retired businessman living during the summer aboard Rochester. Epigraph The novel's epigraph, \\"che mena il vento, e che batte la pioggia, e che s'incontran con si aspre lingue\\" (\\"whom the wind drives, and whom the rain beats, and those who clash with such bitter tongues\\") comes from Canto XI of Dante's Inferno. Background The book was inspired by the most difficult years of Fitzgerald's own life, years that she had spent living on an old Thames sailing barge named Grace on Battersea Reach. She later regretted that some translations of the novel's title suggested \\"far from the shore\\" when she was in fact writing about boats that were anchored just a few yards from the bank, and the \\"emotional restlessness of my characters, halfway between the need for security and the doubtful attraction of danger\\".  Critical reception  The novel was reviewed in The New York Times Book Review,The Independent and The Guardian. In his Understanding Penelope Fitzgerald (2004), Peter Wolfe characterised the novel as \\"a pocket epic, packing into 141 pages the piecemeal dissolution of a way of life\\". He considered the work to be that of a master ‚Äì more darkly expansive than Fitzgerald's first two novels while displaying the same tightness and precision. The author employs, he said, a sensual descriptive style with closely interlocked narrative, and her uncanny gift for describing the commonplace and overlooked galvanises the flow. In a 2013 introduction, Alan Hollinghurst noted that Offshore was the novel in which Fitzgerald found her form ‚Äì her technique and her power. He noted that the group portrait of the boat owners within the novel is constantly developing, change and flux being the essence of the book, with the author moving between the strands of the story with insouciant wit and ease. Booker Prize Offshore won the Booker Prize in 1979. Hilary Spurling, one of the judges, later said that the panel was unable to decide between A Bend in the River and Darkness Visible, settling on Offshore as a compromise. The book's surprise win was greeted with a reaction that Fitzgerald's publisher described as \\"so unpleasant a demonstration of naked spite\\".

The Decathlon entered production in the United States in 1970 as a more powerful and stronger complement to the American Champion Citabria line of aircraft. The Decathlon was designed by the Champion Aircraft Corporation, and is a derivative of the 7-series Citabrias. While the Citabria designs remain successful, and the introduction of the 7KCAB variant of the Citabria had added limited inverted flight capability, the Citabrias are not capable of \\"outside\\" maneuvers, those requiring significant negative-g loads. Pilots wanted an aircraft capable of more maneuvers, and Champion introduced the 8KCAB Decathlon in response to this demand. Development The Decathlon entered production at Champion in 1972, immediately before the company was acquired by Bellanca Aircraft Corporation, so only a handful were produced by Champion. Bellanca continued production of the Decathlon throughout the 1970s, moving to the Super Decathlon variant during 1976. Bellanca built over 600 of the 8KCAB design before production of the aircraft was interrupted when the company's assets were liquidated in 1981. The Decathlon design passed through the hands of a number of companies through the 1980s, including a Champion Aircraft Company which was no relation to the Champion Aircraft of the 1960s, but no Decathlons were built in that period. American Champion Aircraft Corporation acquired the Decathlon design, along with the 8GCBC Scout and the group of Citabria and Champ variants, in 1990, bringing the Super Decathlon version back into production that same year. It is still being produced. Design 8KCAB Super Decathlon, built 2005 The Decathlon traces its lineage back to the Aeronca Champ, by way of the Citabria. Like the Citabria, the Decathlon features tandem seating and center-stick controls. The fuselage and tail surfaces are constructed of welded metal tubing. The outer shape of the fuselage is created by a combination of wooden formers and longerons, covered with fabric. The cross-section of the metal fuselage truss is triangular, a design feature which can be traced back to the earliest Aeronca C-2 design of the late 1920s. The strut-braced wings of the Decathlon are, like the fuselage and tail surfaces, fabric covered, using aluminum ribs. The wings of Champion and Bellanca Decathlons were built with wooden spars. American Champion has been using aluminum spars in the aircraft it has produced and has made the aluminum-spar wings available for retrofit installation on older aircraft. Compared to the Citabria's wingspan of , the Decathlon's wingspan is shorter, at . One of the major developments of the 8KCAB Decathlon over the 7KCAB Citabria is the Decathlon's wing, which employs a semi-symmetrical airfoil, as opposed to the Citabria's flat-bottomed airfoil. This change gives the Decathlon better inverted flight and negative-g maneuver capabilities. The landing gear of the Decathlon is in a conventional arrangement. The main gear legs of most Decathlons are made of spring steel, though American Champion began to use aluminum gear legs in 2004. Like the 7KCAB, the engine of the 8KCAB has a fuel injection system, as opposed to a carburetor. To facilitate negative-g flight, the fuel system incorporates a 1.5 gallon header tank beneath the instrument panel, and the engine is fitted with a Christen Industries inverted oil system. Champion and Bellanca built the Decathlon with several Lycoming IO-320 engine variants, all of , and with the choice of a fixed-pitch or constant speed propeller. The major improvement in Bellanca's introduction of the Super Decathlon was the change of engine to the Lycoming AEIO-360-H1A or ‚ÄìH1B, both of , which was accompanied by a selection of constant speed propellers. The American Champion Super Decathlon uses the AEIO-360-H1B, along with a constant speed propeller. Operational history Though the Decathlon went out of production within a decade of its introduction, this was not due to any fault in the design, but rather to the slump in general aviation in the United States at the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s. Since its reintroduction, the Super Decathlon has sold steadily. Decathlons and Super Decathlons remain popular as aerobatic trainers, as beginning and intermediate aerobatic aircraft, and as personal aircraft. Famous people Steve Fossett was flying a Bellanca-built Super Decathlon when he went missing on September 3, 2007.Missing - Steve Fossett from Check-Six.com He took off from an airstrip at William Barron Hilton's Flying-M Ranch, about southeast of Reno, Nevada.

Ford revived the name for another two year production run in 2012 and 2013. It was produced for the Trans Am racing series. First generation (1969‚Äì1970) 1970 Boss 302 Mustang shaker hood scoop The Camaro/Mustang rivalry had begun in 1967 with the introduction of the Chevrolet Camaro by General Motors. The Camaro was the largest threat to the lead Ford had in the \\"pony car\\" field, a market segment largely created by Ford with the introduction of the Mustang in mid-year 1964. The performance of the Mustang with 289 and 390 engines was not up to the Camaro, with its small block and big block V8. In an effort to improve the Mustang's image Ford made a 428 Cobra Jet V8 and a Ford Boss 302 engine optional for the 1968 mid-year and 1969 models, respectively. The 1969‚Äì70 Boss 302 (Hi-Po) engine was created in 1968 for the SCCA's 1969 Trans-Am road racing series. Available in the Boss 302 Mustangs of 1969‚Äì70, it's a unique Ford small-block engine featuring a thin-wall, high nickel content block casting. It differed substantially from regular 302s, with 4-bolt mains, screw in freeze plugs, and heads using a canted valve design being developed for the planned 351 Cleveland (which debuted the following year). The construction was aided by the two engines sharing a cylinder head bolt pattern, though the Boss 302 heads had to have their coolant passages slightly modified. This optional engine, and indeed the entire vehicle package, including handling and aerodynamic aids, was made available for the express purpose of meeting the homologation guidelines to compete in the SCCA Trans-Am series, which limited engine displacement to 305 C.I.D. (5.0L) in order to compete. The Boss 429 Mustang was born in a similar way, except with the intent of homologating Ford's new \\"semi-HEMI\\" 429 C.I.D. (7.0L) engine (to race in NASCAR, instead of Trans Am). The much larger engine in the Boss 429 reflects the less restrictive engine displacement limits of NASCAR at the time. The Boss 302 Mustang was styled by Larry Shinoda, a former GM employee. The car featured a reflective \\"c-stripe\\". The fake air scoops in the rear quarter panel fenders of the regular production 1969 Mustangs were eliminated on the Boss 302 models. A black horizontal rear window shade and a blackout hood were both options. It was one of the first production models with a front spoiler and rear deck wing. The name \\"Boss\\" came about when Shinoda was asked what project he was working on, he answered \\"the boss's car\\" because the project was a secret. Also Shinoda had called it the \\"Boss\\" as an homage to the new President of Ford Semon \\"Bunkie\\" Knudson who had brought Shinoda over from GM's Chevrolet Division after Knudson had left. Changes for the 1970 model year included side \\"hockey stick\\" stripes which started along the top of the hood, along with the 1970 grille which replaced the four headlights with two vents in the outside position while retaining dual headlights within the grille opening. The dual exhaust system was redesigned, along with the competition suspension and a standard Hurst shifter. The intake valves were slightly smaller, and cast aluminum valve covers replaced the chrome. With a suggested price of $3,720, a total of 7,013 were sold. In addition to a lower ride height, standard equipment included front disc brakes, larger sway bars, heavier duty spindles, reinforced shock towers, a four speed manual transmission, and the solid-lifter Boss 302 V8 engine, with its free-breathing Cleveland style heads, which had valves larger than most engines more than a third larger in displacement. This \\"G Code\\" engine was rated at . The 1970 model could accelerate from 0 to in 6.9 seconds, and the quarter mile (~400 m) took 14.6 seconds, reaching a speed of . Although Ford's Drag Pack option with a special oil cooler was never formally offered on the Boss 302, it was often included with the 4.30:1 rear axle ratio. This coveted option is recognizable when the hood is opened to reveal Ford's vertically mounted oil cooler in front of the radiator. Ford also had an option for Boss 302's and 429's for deluxe interior rather than standard interior Trans-Am racing 1970 Mustang Boss 302 race car The SCCA Trans-Am series was popular in the late 1960s, especially after the birth of the \\"pony car\\". A type of \\"stock-car\\" racing usually held on road courses, the series limited maximum engine displacement to 5 liters, or 305 cubic inches. In an effort to be competitive, various Detroit car manufacturers produced some impressive variants of their usual \\"pony car\\" lineups in both road and track trim (for homologation purposes), equipped with high-performing variants of their \\"small\\" 300-inch class V8 engines in order to make as much power as possible from the limited displacement. The Boss 302 program was part of an effort by the Ford Motor Company to win the coveted SCCA Trans-Am Championship in 1969 and 1970. Penske Camaros had triumphed in 1968 and 1969. Team Penske switched to AMC Javelin the following year so the Boss 302's direct competition in the 1970 series were the AAR Cudas, the Pontiac Firebird, the Team Chaparral Camaros, and the Penske AMC Javelins. The Ford entry for 1969 and 1970 was the Boss 302 Mustang. In 1969, two factors prevented victory; 1) Tire trouble. 2) Slow pit stops. With Roger Penske (a.k.a. \\"The organizer\\") as Chevrolet's racing team manager, the pit stops were magically choreographed and organized to perfection. When pit stop times between Mustangs and Camaros are compared, it turns out Ford lost several races \\"in the pits\\". Ford was also using Firestone brand tires, which gave them trouble in 1969. In 1970 they switched to Goodyear. The factory effort was headed up by Bud Moore, who fielded two cars in the 1970 season, and won the championship that year. The Bud Moore Mustangs edged out Team Penske's Javelins, and lead Penske driver Mark Donohue lost out to Bud Moore driver Parnelli Jones. Then, in 1971 AMC came out with a redesigned Javelin and returned to the track with ex-Mustang driver, George Follmer and Mark Donohue. With Mark Donohue behind the wheel of the AMC Javelin, the Mustang and the others were defeated in 1971, and again with George Follmer driving the Javelin in 1972. Australian Touring Cars Allan Moffat driving the Boss 302 Mustang at Sandown in 1972. The Boss Mustang platform experienced racing success in Australia, with Canadian-born driver Allan Moffat, driving his Coca-Cola-sponsored Mustang to a recorded 101 wins from 151 starts. Moffat's car was a gift from Ford's American in-house race car fabrication and engineering facility, Kar Kraft, and finished off by Bud Moore Engineering. Moffat raced the Mustang in the Australian Touring Car Championship (ATCC) from 1969‚Äì1972. Although he failed to place in the top 10 in 1969, he finished 6th in 1970, 2nd in 1971 and 3rd in 1972. As of December 2012, this car has been fully restored to original, and is owned by Queensland based collector David Bowden who regularly shows the car at historic events throughout Australia. Since its restoration, the only person Bowden has allowed to drive the car (other than his son Dan) is its former owner Allan Moffat. Moffat has said that the car is his favourite car of his 30 years in racing, and that the gift of the car from Ford in 1969 was a pivotal moment in his career. Collectibility The Boss 302 is reproduced as a model and toy, with diecast models including Hot Wheels, Matchbox, and Ertl's \\"American Muscle\\", and many others. It is recognizable by the \\"hockey stick\\" side stripe, rear louvers and chin spoiler (although those features can also signify a Boss 429 Mustang). The 1970 is available, but there are also some 4-headlight 1969 models as well. Many \\"Boss clones\\" (i.e. replicas) have been created, with varying degrees of accuracy, out of regular fastback cars due to the relative rarity and expense of existing examples of the original automobiles, especially race-prepped models. In 2007, a pair of restored 1969 Boss Mustangs sold for $530,000. Saleen Parnelli Jones S302 (2007) In 2007, Saleen and American Racing Legend, Parnelli Jones, created a limited- edition version of the Mustang. Though often called the Saleen/Parnelli Jones S302, it was designed to pay homage to the legendary 1970 Boss 302 that Parnelli Jones had raced in back in the Trans Am series against Javelins, Camaros and Cudas. With only 500 built, all were delivered in the color Grabber Orange. In this homage to the Trans Am race car driven by Parnelli Jones, Steve Saleen modified virtually everything to make it a great looking and great driving car that resembles the championship winning car of 1970. To deliver the Parnelli Jones experience each of the 500 cars were bored and stroked to 302ci to match the Boss 302 motor in the race car. The 302ci Saleen built, 3-valve V8 produces 400 hp and 390 ft-lbs of torque. The high revving engine was blueprinted and balanced, equipped with a Saleen forged steel crankshaft, forged aluminum pistons, Saleen forged connecting rods, Saleen ported aluminum cylinder heads, competition Saleen camshafts and matching valve springs that allow it to rev to its 6,500 rpm all day long if called upon. It's a refreshing change from the \\"take two blowers and call me in the morning\\" speed prescription we've all gotten hooked on in the modular engine era. It's also equipped with Saleen under drive pulleys, a billet harmonic balancer and lightweight aluminum flywheel. The rest of the drivetrain includes a rugged Tremec 5-speed transmission with a special close-ratio Saleen shifter and 3.73 rear gears. The exhaust is run through the Saleen 2 1/2\\" performance stainless system that sounds incredible. The appearance modifications are subtle but make this Mustang stand out. Like the Boss 302 of 1970 modifications include the iconic flat black Shaker hood, rear louvers, special chrome surround of the unique front and rear fascia, replica mini-lite alloy wheels, replica rear wing, special side skirts, special front spoiler, billet aluminum fuel fill door, hood pins and limited-edition badging. The interior is stunning. It's Black leather with Grabber Orange inserts. Even the dash is autographed by Parnelli Jones and Steve Saleen. Perhaps the best part of this car is the reworked Racecraft suspension that Saleen was so famous for in his race cars, along with the Parnelli inspired Watts link rear suspension components just like the 1970 race car. The car handles like it is on rails, yet is smooth and comfortable. Braking is incredible with special Saleen 4-piston front calipers and vented rotors . This car is a balance of power and handling the \\"Yin and the Yang\\" that makes for an unforgettable drive. Saleen PJ302.jpg Second generation (2012‚Äì2013) Ford revived the Boss 302 nameplate for 2012. The standard 2011 Ford Mustang GT's 5.0-liter Coyote V8 engine is enhanced and was referred to within Ford's development teams as the Road Runner engine.http://www.mustangandfords.com/car- reviews/m5lp-1108-2011-ford-mustang-302/ Upgrades include a forged rotating assembly, CNC ported heads, revised camshafts and a high flow \\"runners in the box\\" intake taken from the 302R racecar. It produces at 7400 rpm ‚Äì over the standard GT's . The engine loses about of torque at peak when compared to the standard GT. It is rated at at 4500 rpm and comes with a 6-speed MT-82 manual transmission. A solid rear axle with 3.73:1 differential uses carbon fiber plates in its limited slip differential or an optional Torsen differential. The quad exhaust system made up of two standard Mustang GT outlets and two side pipes that exit on either side of the rear crossover. The side pipes send the exhaust through metal \\"Attenuation\\" discs to create an extra growling exhaust sound. The discs are removable and include a spacer plate sized to match aftermarket exhaust dump valves. The Boss 302 takes the Mustang GT's suspension and adds higher-rate coil springs, stiffer bushings, and a larger diameter rear stabilizer bar. The body is lowered up front and just in the rear to give it a more raked stance designed to recall the original. The shock absorbers are adjustable at the shock tower by using a flat head screwdriver. The standard Mustang traction control system and electronic stability control programs have been altered with a new intermediate sport mode designed to allow for more flexibility on the track. The aero package (i.e. spoilers, splitters, etc.) is almost entirely copied from the Boss 302R race car. The 19-inch black-alloy racing wheels are 9-inches wide up front and 9.5-inches out back and come fitted with 255/40-19 (front) and 285/35-19 (rear) Pirelli P-Zero tires. Ford produced 2000 standard Boss 302 models within 764 Laguna Seca models for 2012 as well for 2013 (2000 total).  Boss 302 Laguna Seca edition  The Laguna Seca edition features a map of the track on the rear badge. The Boss 302 Laguna Seca edition is a further upgraded version of the Boss 302. Additions include Recaro sport seats, a Torsen limited-slip rear differential (both optional on the standard Boss 302), revised suspension tuning with unique spring and damper rates, and a larger rear stabilizer. The Laguna Seca model loses its rear seats, which are replaced by a cross-car X-brace to increase structural rigidity approximately 10%. It rides on 19x9-inch front (255/40-19) and 19x10 inch rear (285/35-19) light-weight alloy wheels with R-compound ultra high-performance tires. Ford Racing front brake ducts help cool the brakes. The 2012 Laguna Seca Boss 302 comes in two colors ‚Äì Black or Ingot Silver ‚Äì with a red roof and red accents. For 2013, color choices include both School Bus Yellow and Black, both with reflective matte silver stripes. A more aggressive front splitter and a larger rear spoiler increase downforce for high speed track use. Ford produced 750 Laguna Seca versions for 2012 and 2013 years (750 total). The limited-edition Laguna Seca is designed to maintain street-legality while bridging the gap between the Boss 302 and the track-only Boss 302R and 302S.

In its days as a motion picture theater, it was best known as a place where African- Americans could see first-run movies; during that time, only whites were allowed in most theaters because of segregation laws. The Carver is now a live performance venue which seats 527, and is also the home of the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame. History Located on the corner of Fourth Avenue North and 17th Street North, the Carver was opened in 1935. A 1945 renovation equipped the Carver with many new features, including 1,300 of the latest model theater chairs, air conditioning, and improved sound and projection, as reported by The Birmingham News. The Fourth Avenue area was a business and entertainment hub for the city's black community, and was also the location of many events in the Civil Rights Movement. As with most downtown theaters, the Carver's fortunes declined over the years. In later years, the theater showed pornographic movies, and the facility closed sometime in the early 1980s. The City of Birmingham, seeking to improve the area where many events of the Civil Rights Movement took place, purchased the Carver in 1990 and remodeled it for live performance use, with an eye toward remembering the Carver's place in the African-American Community. One of the planned uses was a home for the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame. Since its reopening, the Carver has hosted many events such as the Taste of 4th Avenue Jazz Festival, and the annual AJHoF Student Jazz Festival, as well as performances by Duke Ellington Orchestra, Lionel Hampton, Diana Krall, Lou Marini, the Magic City Jazz Orchestra, Ray Reach and the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame All-Stars, Gregg Karukas, the Tom Joyner syndicated radio show, and many other notable performers.

When the Pennsylvania Turnpike opened in 1940, it was known as the \\"Tunnel Highway\\" because it traversed seven tunnels: from east to west, Blue Mountain, Kittatinny Mountain, Tuscarora Mountain, Sideling Hill, Rays Hill, Allegheny Mountain, and Laurel Hill. There was one tunnel through each mountain, and the highway was reduced to a single lane in each direction through each tunnel. These tunnels were originally built as part of the South Pennsylvania Railroad. One short tunnel was bypassed during the original construction of the Turnpike. By the late 1950s, the turnpike was so heavily used that traffic congestion demanded expansion because bottlenecks at the two-lane tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike became a major problem. Traffic jams formed at each tunnel, especially during the summer. The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (PTC) conducted studies on either expanding or bypassing the tunnels. In 1959, four Senators urged state officials to work with the turnpike commission to study ways to reduce the traffic jams. That year, the commission began studies aimed at resolving the traffic jams at the Laurel Hill and Allegheny Mountain tunnels; studies for the other tunnels followed. At the conclusion of the studies, the turnpike commission planned to make the entire turnpike four lanes by either adding a second tube at the tunnels or bypassing them. The new and upgraded tunnel tubes would feature white tiles, fluorescent lighting, and upgraded ventilation. The turnpike commission announced plans to build a second bore at the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel and a four-lane bypass of the Laurel Hill Tunnel in 1960. A bypass was planned for the Laurel Hill Tunnel because traffic would be more quickly and less expensively relieved than it would by boring another tunnel. In 1962, the turnpike commission approved these two projects. That August, $21 million in bonds were sold to finance the two projects. The Laurel Hill Tunnel was bypassed using a deep cut to the north; it would feature a wide median, truck climbing lanes, and a -deep cut into the mountain. Groundbreaking for the new alignment took place on September 6, 1962. This bypass opened to traffic on October 30, 1964 at a cost of $7.5 million. Work on boring the second tube at Allegheny Mountain Tunnel also began on September 6, 1962. The former South Pennsylvania Railroad tunnel was considered, but was again rejected because of its poor condition. On March 15, 1965, the new tube opened to traffic, after which the original tube was closed to allow updates to be made. It reopened on August 25, 1966. The construction of the second tube at Allegheny Mountain cost $12 million. The turnpike bypass of Rays Hill and Sideling Hill tunnels opened to traffic on November 26, 1968. The Sideling Hill and Rays Hill tunnels were bypassed by a new highway, as was the Cove Valley Travel Plaza, which was located on the westbound side of the eastern portal of the Sideling Hill Tunnel. Instead, a new Sideling Hill Travel Plaza was built to cater for travellers in both directions of the highway. Abandonment Eastern portal of the Sideling Hill Tunnel Eastern portal of the Rays Hill Tunnel Today, the Abandoned Turnpike, as it is commonly known, is a popular tourist attraction. The PTC sold most of the property to the Southern Alleghenies Conservancy (SAC) for $1 in 2001. The property is managed by Friends of the Pike 2 Bike, a coalition of non-profit groups (including the SAC) to eventually convert the stretch into a bike trail. The property is officially closed to the public, and no motor vehicles are allowed on the property, but bicycle riders are free to use it at their own risk. The trail requires helmets and lights. Because this stretch sits on parts of the former right-of-way of the South Pennsylvania Railroad that was never completed but later formed the basis of the mainline turnpike, this makes the Pike2Bike unofficially a rail trail. The PTC still owns a stretch of about on the west and on the east for maintenance purposes. The tunnel's entrances have deteriorated due to vandalism, and their signboards were taken sometime between 1981 and 1999. However, tunnel structure is still sound despite not having been maintained for decades. A business plan and feasibility study was completed by Gannett Fleming in 2005. It proposed various ideas to make the trail as accessible as possible for cyclists, hikers, inline skaters, and equestrians. , the trail is in the process of changing ownership to Bedford County. This is in response to the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources' need for a governmental body to own the trail before it can give out grants. The Friends of the Pike 2 Bike will continue to run and oversee the trail. Later uses In the early 1970s, the emission levels of unleaded gasoline were tested in Rays Hill Tunnel. A Plymouth Satellite was used as the test vehicle. Test rumble strips from the SNAP project, just outside the western portal of the Rays Hill Tunnel The PTC and PennDOT used the highway to train maintenance workers, as well as for testing of rumble strips. There have also been numerous military uses for the highway; the tunnels were considered as a storage area for weapons, as was the open highway for aircraft. The military also used the highway for training soldiers for Iraq in the early 2000s, even after the highway was sold to the SAC. The site of the former Cove Valley Travel Plaza was used as a shooting range for the Pennsylvania State Police. Since the SAC bought the property, the site has not been used as a shooting range, although warning signs are still posted in the area. In 2008 the highway was used for the filming of the Dimension Films movie The Road starring Viggo Mortensen. The studios mildly restored the exterior of the eastern portal of the Ray's Hill Tunnel when it was used for filming. Access End of the remaining PTC-owned stub of the Abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike following the demolition of a bridge over US 30 In 2005, the PTC restricted access to the abandoned turnpike by demolishing an overpass over U.S. Route 30 (US 30) in Breezewood and an overpass on Pump Station Road near the site of the old Cove Valley Travel Plaza. The demolition of the overpasses removed the liability and expense of repairing the aging bridges, marked the property lines between the public and the PTC-owned sections of the property, and prevented motorized vehicles from easily entering the abandoned turnpike. The original plans for the removal included an access road, but somewhere along the way, it was removed and not known to Pike 2 Bike officials until it was too late. , the Friends of the Pike 2 Bike are seeking to obtain grants that will allow the building of an access road and to rebuild on it the last remaining original toll booth, which was obtained in 2006. The toll booth will be used to collect a parking donation that will be used to pay for maintenance. An access road was built in the late 2000s on the PTC-owned side of the former Pump Station Road overpass, making the section still owned by the PTC a de facto access road to the active turnpike in itself; however, like other access roads along the turnpike, it is off-limits to the public and is only used by the PTC or Pennsylvania State Police. Access point at US 30 and Tannery Road There are three access points to the public section of the abandoned highway: * The intersection of Tannery Road and US 30 is just east of the Breezewood interchange where I-70, US-30, and I-76 meet. It sits near the western end of the abandoned turnpike, which can be reached by climbing a small hill. Parking is available in front of the orange snow fence at the bottom of the hill. Rays Hill Tunnel lies about two miles east of this point. * A parking lot exists on the trail at the eastern end of the turnpike off Pump Station Road north of US 30; the entrance is a service road just south of where a turnpike overpass was removed in 2005. This access point lies near the site of the former Cove Valley Travel Plaza and about one mile east of the Sideling Hill Tunnel. * A forest service path called Oregon Road leaves US Route 30 at that highway's intersection with Pennsylvania Route 915 about a mile east of the crest of Ray's Hill. Oregon Road runs north from US Route 30 for several hundred feet, then bears to the right after it passes under the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76). The road to the left is a privately owned driveway leading to Valley-Hi. The road to the right is Oregon Road, which runs for several miles of dirt and gravel road before reconnecting with PA 915 just south of Wells Tannery. Oregon Road runs parallel and adjacent to the abandoned highway for much of its length, and several clearings in the forest allow for parking and access to the road. These access points lie between the two tunnels: Rays Hill is about three miles west and Sideling Hill is about two miles east. Other tunnel bypasses Site of the former Cove Valley Travel Plaza, the Sideling Hill Tunnel is about a half mile to the west The Abandoned Turnpike is perhaps the best-known of tunnel bypasses on toll roads. Among the other bypassed tunnels: * The aforementioned bypass of the Laurel Hill Tunnel, which preceded the Sideling Hill and Rays Hill bypass by four years. * The Memorial Tunnel on the West Virginia Turnpike was bypassed in 1987 to complete upgrading that highway to Interstate standards. Unlike the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the West Virginia Turnpike was built two lanes for its entire length, and needed an additional two lanes in order to get the I-77 and I-64 designations. * The PTC considered bypassing the Lehigh Tunnel on the Northeast Extension before ultimately deciding on twinning the tunnel. Cost for the bypass and unnecessary added mileage to the highway were deciding factors. * The PTC has been considering bypassing the deteriorating Allegheny Mountain Tunnel to alleviate traffic congestion. Boring a third tunnel is also being considered. Planning resumed in 2014.

Education and career He attended Phillips Academy, Andover and Dartmouth College (B.A., 1879, A.M., 1887) and later Syracuse University (Ph.D., 1893), studying mathematics. He was professor of mathematics at the Dakota School of Mines from 1887 to 1890, then attended Clark University for a year before beginning teaching at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1891, where he taught for the remainder of his life. He was head of the Mathematics Department at WPI from 1908 until his death, and was interim president from 1911 to 1913. He married twice, first in 1884 to Laura Chamberlain (died 1911) and again in 1912 to Emma B. Fisher. On October 11, 1916, aged 59, he was struck by a truck in front of his home and was killed. The Number Concept Conant's most significant work was his 1896 book The Number Concept: Its Origin and Development. This was a seminal work in the anthropological and psychological study of numerals, focusing on the analysis of Native American number systems from a generally cultural evolutionist theoretical perspective. Conant's ethnographic data generally reflected the limited development of anthropology at the time. Conant's characterization of the numeral systems of Native American languages as 'primitive' or 'savage' is not widely accepted today. Conant's work, however, influenced scholars such as Lucien L√©vy-Bruhl, and represented the first systematic comparative analysis of numeral systems of North America. Legacy Conant left $10,000 to the American Mathematical Society in his will, which was disbursed in 1976 following the death of Conant's second wife. In 2000 the Society established a yearly prize (Levi L. Conant Prize) in his name to honor the best expository paper published in the Bulletin of the AMS or the Notices of the AMS in the past five years.

Taken together, they offer an intense musical life. Musical venues and activities By province: Statue of Guido in Arezzo *Arezzo: the city is indelibly connected with the name of Guido d'Arezzo, the 11th-century monk who invented modern musical notation and the do-re-mi system of naming notes of the scale. The modern city of Arezzo has two prominent theaters: the Teatro Petrarca, built in 1833 and today the host theater for the Concerts of Arretium series of both classical and jazz music, and the Teatro dei Ricomposti, from 1790. The town of Bibbiena has the Teatro Dovizi, which hosts and annual opera festival entitled Operaperta (Open Opera). *Grosseto: the province hosts, annually, the Santa Fiora in Musica festival. The Musica nel Chiostro Batignano Opera Festival ran here from 1974 to 2004.Festival closure notice, La Repubblica, 21 February 2004. (Retrieved 5 May 2016) Grosseto is the area that lays claim to the origins of the famous May harvest rituals that are speculated to be at the origins of staged drama that later developed into opera (see Music of Italy). The town has two theaters: the Teatro degli Industri and the Teatro Moderno. *Livorno: the city has the Pietro Mascagni Musical Institute, named for its \\"favorite son\\" and composer of Cavalleria Rusticana, one of the landmarks of Italian musical Realism. The province incorporates the island of Elba, site of the short-lived first exile of Napoleon and today a venue for music on the premises of the Teatro dell'Accademia, built at the behest of the emperor, himself. The city also hosts a museum dedicated to the life and work of Mascagni. *Lucca: the province is the birthplace of the greatest exponent of Italian lyric Romanticism, Giacomo Puccini. Luca is awash in music and memorabilia that recall the composer, including the annual Puccini Festival. His home at Torre del Lago is a museum, shrine, and magnet for musical pilgrims from around the world. The city of Lucca has the Teatro dei Gigli and‚Äîas if one favorite son (Puccini) were not enough‚Äîthe Luigi Boccherini Musical Institute. *Massa-Carrara: the town of Massa has the Teatro Guglielmi and nearby Massa‚Äîas the name might indicate‚Äîhas a theater, the Teatro degli Animosi, built in 1840 with the enormous amounts of money made from the world- famous Carrara marble quarries. The facade of the theater, obviously, is all Carrara marble. *Pisa: the city of Pisa hosts the Teatro Verdi, home of the impressive Vincenzo Galileo Choir, named for the great musician of the Florentine Camerata and, incidentally, father of the astronomer Galileo. In the town of Volterra, there is the Teatro Persio Flacco, site of the annual Volterrana Musical Spring series of classical music concerts. *Pistoia: the site, in the town of Montecatini Terme, of the Imperial Theater. The town has been short-and long-term home to a number of composers: Rossini, Richard Strauss, Toscanini, Enrico Caruso and Giuseppe Verdi. The Art Academy Museum is a repository of memorabilia of these composers. *Prato: the city is historically one of the important centers for organ construction in Italy. There are two prominent theatres in Prato: the Teatro Metastasio and the Politeama Pratese, home of the recently founded Camerata Strumentale Citt√† di Prato, a youth orchestra. *Siena: the city is well known for the Accademia Musicale Chigiana, an organization that currently sponsors major musical activities such as the Siena Music Week and the Alfredo Casella International Composition Competition.

It was called to propose a general truce and an unprecedented inter-gang alliance. The impetus for the meeting was the murder of \\"Black Benjie\\", a peace keeper of the Ghetto Brothers. While no lasting peace was ever established, a subsequent negotiation established a procedure for dealing with conflicts to avoid street warfare. The meeting is notable as one of the first attempts by street organizations to broker a truce between groups of different ethnic backgrounds. Peace treaty After the death of \\"Black Benjie,\\" a member of the Ghetto Brothers who turned community activist, a peace treaty meeting was organized among the South Bronx gangs. The gangs in attendance that are most frequently mentioned include the Black Spades, Ghetto Brothers, Savage Skulls, Turbans, and Seven Immortals. This historic treaty among South Bronx gangs lasted until the crack cocaine wars erupted during the early 1980s. Gangs that attended the Hoe Avenue peace treaty meeting: * Alley Cats * Bachelors * Black Cats Inc * Black Ivory * Black Pearls * Black Spades * Blue Imperials * Born To Raise Hell * Brothers & Sisters (Offshoot Of Seven Immortals) * Deserters * Dirty Dozen R.T.

Attendants included the Black Pearls, Savage Skulls, Turbans, Young Sinners, Royal Javelins, Dutchmen, Magnificent Seven, Dirty Dozens, Liberated Panthers, Black Spades, Seven Immortals, Latin Spades, Peacemakers, and Ghetto Brothers. The peace meeting was organized by the Ghetto Brothers after one of their members, 25-year-old Cornell \\"Black Benjie\\" Benjamin, was killed trying to stop a gang fight.Reaper, pp. 96, 93 The objective was to draw up a peace treaty in honor of \\"Black Benjie\\", who had been the designated peacemaker of the Ghetto Brothers. To help ensure it would be nonviolent, it was arranged to have a member of the Turbans gang to take position, with a rifle, on a rooftop across the street from the Boys' Club on the day of the meeting.Sources: The Compound, p. 88; and Vampires, last chapter Inside, the power structure was in evidence. Presidents, vice-presidents, and warlords sat on folding chairs in a circle in the middle of the club's gymnasium. Gang members took seats in the bleachers, while wives were made to wait outside the building. Only two females were permitted inside--the presidents of the all-girl gangs, the Alley Cats and the Savage Sisters--and their folding chairs were placed in the last/fourth row, behind those of the warlords.The Compound, pp. 88-89 The peace meeting appears in Flyin' Cut Sleeves, a documentary film by Rita Fecher and Henry Chalfant. Spanish Eddie One of the Youth Services Agency's Bronx gang crisis squad, 27-year-old Eduardo Vincenti, \\"Spanish Eddie\\" (a veteran of the 1950s Bronx street gangs), began working on the grandiose notion of getting every major gang in the Bronx to sign an intergang treaty and alliance.Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-hop Generation by Jeff Chang, D.J. Kool Herc, page 55, published 2005, Macmillan This giant alliance would be called \\"The Family\\", and every gang would become a division in the larger gang. The idea had just enough vision in it for gang leaders to be interested in its possibilities. Vincenti felt that once unified under a single name, the gangs could do virtually anything, if someone provided them with the right kind of social vision. The police admitted to the existence of as many as 10,000 gang members in the Bronx alone.Reaper, p. 93 Vincenti signed on 68 gangs to the coalition/treaty before he and 10 other crisis squad members were suddenly transferred from the Bronx and reassigned to Brooklyn, where he was shot in the face trying to prevent a gun battle in the West Farms neighborhood. Vincenti survived to continue work on the Brotherhood Family in his spare time. Bronx Squad Crisis members believed the shooting was orchestrated in response to his attempts to broker a treaty.  40th anniversary In 2011, former members of the Ghetto Brothers and Black Panthers spoke to the New York Daily News in advance of a planned commemoration scheduled to take place at the Bronx River Art Center at 305 East 140th Street. Joseph Mpa of the Black Panthers stated that the truce itself played a role in the rise of hip hop culture since it permitted greater ease of travel between neighborhoods without fear of reprisals for crossing gang boundaries.

It lies on the southern tip of the Dollart, a bay of the North Sea between Germany and the Netherlands, and has a land border with the Netherlands. Bunde is among the smaller districts of East Frisia, with a population of 7,607 (as of 2015). About half live in the town of Bunde itself. The district's population density is comparatively low, equating to 62 per square km (160 per sq. mi.), compared to 228/sq. km (591 sq. mi.) for Germany as a whole. In the 17th and 18th centuries, sizeable areas of the district were wrested from the sea by the creation of polders. Bunde's economy centers on agriculture and tourism. The community has been officially recognized as a resort town since 1998. Many of the town's residents commute to jobs elsewhere, notably in Leer, about 13 km (8 mi.) to the east. Residents include a number of Dutch nationals, most of whom commute to jobs in the Netherlands. Reformed Church, Bunde Steinhaus Bunderhee, Bunde The town's cultural artifacts include the Reformed Church (Reformierte Kreuzkirche), the nave of which dates from the 13th century, and the red brick Steinhaus Bunderhee castle, which dates from the 14th century. History Bunde was first mentioned in a document in 1428. The name has been variously written as Buenda, de Bunda and Bonde.Ernst Friedl√§nder: Ostfriesisches Urkundenbuch. Haynel, Emden 1878, , No. 366 (online), accessed 3. September 2011. Due to its situation on a geest, or slightly raised landform, the town was spared the great floods that inundated much of the region in the Middle Ages. Prior to the Reformation, Bunde belonged to the Roman Catholic Diocese of M√ºnster. Bunde became predominantly Protestant in the early 16th century, largely following the Reformed (Calvinist) faith as in the adjacent Netherlands.Wiemann: Aus vergangenen Tagen. 1983, pg. 23. During the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648), Bunde, though not a battlefield, was plundered several times by Imperial (Catholic) troops.Walter Deeters: Ostfriesland im Drei√üigj√§hrigen Krieg, in Emder Jahrbuch f√ºr historische Landeskunde Ostfrieslands, vol. 78 (1998), pg. 32‚Äì44. East Frisia became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1744. Thereafter, crafts and cottage industries came to the fore in the region's economy.Wiemann: Aus vergangenen Tagen. 1983, pg. 140. During the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763), the town was twice occupied by French troops, and was subjected to tributes by the conquerors. After the war, Prussian King Frederick the Great sponsored construction of dikes to expand the region's polders. Bunde's first rail link came after the unification of Germany in 1871. A spur to the Ihrhove‚ÄìNieuweschans railway from Leer to Bad Nieuweschans, Netherlands, was opened in 1876.Ernst M√ºller: Rheiderland in alten Ansichten. Sollermann, Leer, 1983, pg. 12. In the late 19th century the district saw a sizeable immigration of residents to the U.S., primarily for economic and religious reasons.Hartmut Rebuschat: Landschaftspolder: Leben auf dem Meeresgrund. Selbstverlag, Landschaftspolder 2007, pg. 78. Early in the 20th-century dairies began to proliferate, and canneries were built to can local crops of beans and peas.Schulte: Oll Bunn. 2008, pg. 179‚Äì183. As elsewhere in Germany following World War I, economic dislocation and unemployment rose in the 1920s, boosting the appeal of Nazism, especially in rural areas of the district. Nevertheless, the Social Democrats retained a sizeable following in the town until the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933. By mid-1934, however, all non-Nazi political organizations in Germany were repressed and outlawed. Bunde's Jewish community had built a synagogue and primary school in Bunde in the mid-19th century, but with the advent of Nazism and the Holocaust, the community was suppressed and many members were killed. The last Jewish resident of Bunde was deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp in July 1942.Allemannia Judaica: Bunde (Kreis Leer / Ostfriesland, Niedersachsen) J√ºdische Geschichte / Synagoge, accessed 17. February 2012. In April 1945, Bunde was the first East Frisian town to be liberated, being occupied initially by Canadian and Polish forces. Although various buildings were damaged by artillery fire, casualties among the population were few. Polder land with farm buildings. After the war, the district hosted an influx of German refugees expelled from territories east of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line under border changes promulgated at the Potsdam Conference. Later, however, due in part to increasing mechanization of agriculture, the district's population declined, sinking from a peak of 8,893 in 1950 to 7,607 in 2015. Tourism The relatively remote district began to appeal to tourists in the 1980s. Some were attracted by its unspoiled polder landscapes and antique windmills, others by opportunities for cycling and canoeing, and for bird-watching.

That is, no parametric form is assumed for the relationship between predictors and dependent variable. Nonparametric regression requires larger sample sizes than regression based on parametric models because the data must supply the model structure as well as the model estimates.  Definition  In nonparametric regression, we have random variables X and Y and assume the following relationship: : \\\\mathbb{E}[Y\\\\mid X=x] = m(x), where m(x) is some deterministic function. Linear regression is a restricted case of nonparametric regression where m(x) is assumed to be affiene. Some authors use a slightly stronger assumption of additive noise: : Y = m(X) + U, where the random variable U is the \`noise term', with mean 0. Without the assumption that m belongs to a specific parametric family of functions it is impossible to get an unbiased estimate for m, however most estimators are consistent under suitable conditions.  List of general- purpose nonparametric regression algorithms  This is a non-exhaustive list of algorithms suitable for nonparametric regression problems. * nearest neighbors, see nearest-neighbor interpolation and k-nearest neighbors algorithm * regression trees * kernel regression * local regression * multivariate adaptive regression splines * neural networks * support vector regression * smoothing splines  Examples   Gaussian process regression or Kriging  In Gaussian process regression, also known as Kriging, a Gaussian prior is assumed for the regression curve. The errors are assumed to have a multivariate normal distribution and the regression curve is estimated by its posterior mode. The Gaussian prior may depend on unknown hyperparameters, which are usually estimated via empirical Bayes. The hyperparameters typically specify a prior covariance kernel. In case the kernel should also be inferred nonparametrically from the data, the critical filter can be used. Smoothing splines have an interpretation as the posterior mode of a Gaussian process regression.  Kernel regression  Example of a curve (red line) fit to a small data set (black points) with nonparametric regression using a Gaussian kernel smoother. The pink shaded area illustrates the kernel function applied to obtain an estimate of y for a given value of x. The kernel function defines the weight given to each data point in producing the estimate for a target point. Kernel regression estimates the continuous dependent variable from a limited set of data points by convolving the data points' locations with a kernel function‚Äîapproximately speaking, the kernel function specifies how to \\"blur\\" the influence of the data points so that their values can be used to predict the value for nearby locations.  Regression trees  Decision tree learning algorithms can be applied to learn to predict a dependent variable from data. Although the original Classification And Regression Tree (CART) formulation applied only to predicting univariate data, the framework can be used to predict multivariate data, including time series.

Prior to his initial departure from the band he was identified by his face paint, which was based on the film Dead Presidents. Since 2014, he has worn a mask like the rest of the band. Biography Popson left Mushroomhead in mid-2004 due to being overworked and his father's terminal illness. Though it was previously confirmed that Popson would be featured on Mushroomhead's new studio album Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children, it was revealed in an interview with Mushroomhead's then lead singer Jeffrey Nothing that he would no longer be on the album. No specific reason was given except Popson's voice at the time sounded like Mr. Krabs from Spongebob Squarepants, according to Nothing. Popson began making periodic stage appearances during Mushroomhead songs some time around 2008 and has since performed with them numerous times, including filling in for an entire show in 2011 when Waylon Reavis was sick and unable to perform. As of 2013 J Mann announced on his personal Facebook that he has returned to the band. Popson is an actor and musician who has been involved with the industry since the early 1990s. It has been hinted lyrically and in vague interviews that he was raised by a single parent‚Äîhis mother‚Äîfollowing the departure of his father from his life at a young age. However, Popson later regained a relationship with his father, which played a pivotal role in him leaving Mushroomhead. Popson's father, John, died of cancer in September 2006 and in memory of his father, Popson performed a concert at Peabody's Down Under in Cleveland, Ohio on September 29, 2006. The concert acted as a benefit for his father's funeral, and featured Popson performing songs from many of his previous and current bands. Popson is also in an extreme metal band with former Strapping Young Lad/Death drummer Gene Hoglan called Pitch Black Forecast which also features Robert Reinard on guitar and Craig Martini recording studio bass. Martini performed in Pitch Black Forecast's inaugural shows, but was then replaced by Steve Rauckhorst for live shows. The band also added guitarist Tom Shaffner to its lineup. Pitch Black Forecast was formerly known as Absentee and the group's first release was on Popson's Melvins tribute album, released through his record label Fractured Transmitter, titled We Reach: The Music of the Melvins when the band covered the song \\"Revolve.\\" Pitch Black Forecast released its EP Burning in Water... Drowning in Flame on Aug. 11, 2012. It was released independently. A metal project by Popson, titled Scelestus (pronounced sha-less-tus), released an EP through Megaforce Records in May 2011. The group also features Steve \\"Skinny\\" Felton of Mushroomhead and Tommy Church from Mushroomhead and Tenafly Viper. An LP is said to be in the works, but no official release date or confirmation has been reported. In 2013, he confirmed his return to Mushroomhead. His new mask resembles an undead spartan soldier. Popson is known for his rich baritone-like vocals.

Musically, they offer: *Bergamo: the birthplace of Gaetano Donizetti; thus, there is the Teatro Donizetti and the Donizetti Musical Institute, housing a museum dedicated to the life and work of the composer. The city is also the home of the Benvenuto Terzi Guitar Association and a Society for Ancient Music. There is an annual jazz festival in the nearby town of Clusone. *Brescia: the site of the spectacular Teatro Grande, built in 1709; Brescia also hosts the famous Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli International Piano Competition, named for the pianist, born in the city. The Luca Marenzio music conservatory is also located here. *Como: the Teatro Sociale in the city of Como is home to the Lyric Concert Association as well as an opera series entitled Opera...domani (Opera...tomorrow).The city is also an important new venue for the presentation of electronic music. *Cremona: the city is most famously associated with the craft of violin making and illustrious practitioners of that trade, such as the Amati Family, Guarneri Family and Stradivarius. The city is still an active site for aspiring craftsmen and hosts the Stradivarius Scuola internazionale di liuteria, as well as various associations dedicated to the promotion of violin making. Claudio Monteverdi was born in Cremona and was a student of Marc'Antonio Ingegneri. *Lecco: the Harmonia Gentium association promotes significant concerts of sacred music on the premises of the Basilica of San Nicol√≤. The main theater in the city is the Teatro della Societ√†. *Lodi: the city's claim to musical fame is that a 14-year-old Mozart wrote his first string quartet here. The Teatro delle Vigne is the main venue for music and is on the premises of the ancient monastery of San Giovanni e Ognisanti alle Vigne. It hosts a musical archive and a series of autumn concerts. *Mantua: the city was home to many illustrious names in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, the early days of opera. The prominent members of the Florentine Camerata lived here, as did Claudio Monteverdi, whose opera Orfeo, often cited as the \\"first opera\\", was composed for the Timidi music academy. The Teatro Accademica goes back to the 1760s, when Mantua was still part of the Austrian Empire. It was built at the behest of the Empress Maria Theresa and is remembered as the venue where the child prodigy Mozart displayed his youthful musical prowess in a series of recitals. Mantua is also the site of the Lucio Campinai music conservatory, home to the Chamber Orchestra of Mantua. *Pavia: the Teatro Fraschini was opened in 1773, later went through a period when it served as a barracks for the Austrian army, and was later restored to its historic splendour. Currently it is the home venue of the Pavia Chamber Ensemble. *Sondrio: the Villa Quadrio serves as the site for chamber concerts (in the absence of a functioning public theater). The Torelli auditorium hosts frequent concerts of folk choral music by the CAI Choir of Sandrio. *Varese: Venues include the Palazzo Estense, the Villa Cagnola, and the Civic Music Highschool. In nearby Busto Arsizio, there is a permanent chamber music ensemble. References *Guide Cultura, i luoghi della musica (2003) ed. Touring Club Italiano.

They are often used in situations where the fully nonparametric model may not perform well or when the researcher wants to use a parametric model but the functional form with respect to a subset of the regressors or the density of the errors is not known. Semiparametric regression models are a particular type of semiparametric modelling and, since semiparametric models contain a parametric component, they rely on parametric assumptions and may be misspecified and inconsistent, just like a fully parametric model.  Methods  Many different semiparametric regression methods have been proposed and developed. The most popular methods are the partially linear, index and varying coefficient models.  Partially linear models  A partially linear model is given by : Y_i = X'_i \\\\beta + g\\\\left(Z_i \\\\right) + u_i, \\\\, \\\\quad i = 1,\\\\ldots,n, \\\\, where Y_{i} is the dependent variable, X_{i} is a p \\\\times 1 vector of explanatory variables, \\\\beta is a p \\\\times 1 vector of unknown parameters and Z_{i} \\\\in \\\\operatorname{R}^{q} . The parametric part of the partially linear model is given by the parameter vector \\\\beta while the nonparametric part is the unknown function g\\\\left(Z_{i}\\\\right) . The data is assumed to be i.i.d. with E\\\\left(u_{i}|X_{i},Z_{i}\\\\right) = 0 and the model allows for a conditionally heteroskedastic error process E\\\\left(u^{2}_{i}|x,z\\\\right) = \\\\sigma^{2}\\\\left(x,z\\\\right) of unknown form. This type of model was proposed by Robinson (1988) and extended to handle categorical covariates by Racine and Li (2007). This method is implemented by obtaining a \\\\sqrt{n} consistent estimator of \\\\beta and then deriving an estimator of g\\\\left(Z_{i}\\\\right) from the nonparametric regression of Y_{i} - X'_{i}\\\\hat{\\\\beta} on z using an appropriate nonparametric regression method.See Li and Racine (2007) for an in-depth look at nonparametric regression methods.  Index models  A single index model takes the form : Y = g\\\\left(X'\\\\beta_{0}\\\\right) + u, \\\\, where Y , X and \\\\beta_{0} are defined as earlier and the error term u satisfies E\\\\left(u|X\\\\right) = 0 . The single index model takes its name from the parametric part of the model x'\\\\beta which is a scalar single index. The nonparametric part is the unknown function g\\\\left(\\\\cdot\\\\right) .  Ichimura's method  The single index model method developed by Ichimura (1993) is as follows. Consider the situation in which y is continuous. Given a known form for the function g\\\\left(\\\\cdot\\\\right) , \\\\beta_{0} could be estimated using the nonlinear least squares method to minimize the function : \\\\sum_{i=1} \\\\left(Y_i - g\\\\left(X'_i \\\\beta\\\\right)\\\\right)^2. Since the functional form of g\\\\left(\\\\cdot\\\\right) is not known, we need to estimate it. For a given value for \\\\beta an estimate of the function : G\\\\left(X'_i \\\\beta \\\\right) = E\\\\left(Y_i |X'_i \\\\beta\\\\right) = E\\\\left[g\\\\left(X'_i\\\\beta_o \\\\right)|X'_i \\\\beta\\\\right] using kernel method. Ichimura (1993) proposes estimating g\\\\left(X'_{i}\\\\beta\\\\right) with : \\\\hat{G}_{-i}\\\\left(X'_i \\\\beta\\\\right),\\\\, the leave-one-out nonparametric kernel estimator of G\\\\left(X'_{i}\\\\beta\\\\right) .  Klein and Spady's estimator  If the dependent variable y is binary and X_{i} and u_{i} are assumed to be independent, Klein and Spady (1993) propose a technique for estimating \\\\beta using maximum likelihood methods. The log-likelihood function is given by : L\\\\left(\\\\beta\\\\right) = \\\\sum_i \\\\left(1-Y_i\\\\right)\\\\ln\\\\left(1-\\\\hat{g}_{-i}\\\\left(X'_i\\\\beta\\\\right)\\\\right) + \\\\sum_{i}Y_i\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\hat{g}_{-i}\\\\left(X'_i \\\\beta\\\\right)\\\\right), where \\\\hat{g}_{-i}\\\\left(X'_{i}\\\\beta\\\\right) is the leave-one-out estimator.  Smooth coefficient/varying coefficient models  Hastie and Tibshirani (1993) propose a smooth coefficient model given by : Y_i = \\\\alpha\\\\left(Z_i\\\\right) + X'_i\\\\beta\\\\left(Z_i\\\\right) + u_i = \\\\left(1 + X'_i\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} \\\\alpha\\\\left(Z_i\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta\\\\left(Z_i\\\\right) \\\\end{array}\\\\right) + u_i = W'_i\\\\gamma\\\\left(Z_i\\\\right) + u_i, where X_{i} is a k \\\\times 1 vector and \\\\beta\\\\left(z\\\\right) is a vector of unspecified smooth functions of z . \\\\gamma\\\\left(\\\\cdot\\\\right) may be expressed as : \\\\gamma\\\\left(Z_i\\\\right) = \\\\left(E\\\\left[W_i W'_i|Z_i \\\\right]\\\\right)^{-1}E\\\\left[W_i Y_i|Z_i\\\\right].

The Sisters of Loretto are sometimes confused with the Sisters of Loreto, whose members included Mother Teresa of Calcutta. The two congregations are not related. History The Sisters of Loretto were founded in 1812 by three women, Mary Rhodes, Ann Havern, and Christina Stuart, under the guidance of Rev. Charles Nerinckx in Kentucky, under the name of Friends of Mary at the Foot of the Cross. Their mission was to educate the poor children of the frontier. When the community was formed into a religious congregation, it was renamed the Sisters of Loretto at the Foot of the Cross. Mother Praxedes Carty updated the constitution of the Sisters of Loretto with Rome in the early 1900s. The Sisters were early collaborators with the Jesuits in their missionary endeavors among the native Americans. The work of the Sisters spread to the American Southwest during the 1870s, as the Sisters opened a Loretto Academy in Santa Fe, New Mexico. (This school is the site of the famed staircase in the former school chapel, believed by some to have been built through supernatural intervention.) They also began an all-girls school in Montgomery, AL, in 1873, called Loretto High. The Sisters gained a reputation for educational innovation, as well as racial and religious tolerance, which created a strong interest in having their services. By the 1890s they had opened a girls' school in St. Paul, Kansas, in the Diocese of Wichita, and in 1899 were invited to work in the Diocese of Kansas City in Missouri, where they first started teaching in parochial schools of the city and opened a Loretto Academy in 1901. The Sisters also worked in Iowa and had a mission school for the children of the Osage nation in Oklahoma.National Park Service \\"National Register of Historic Places Nomination Forms\\" The Sisters founded two colleges: Loretto Heights College in Denver (founded as an academy in 1891 and becoming a college in 1918) and Loretto College in Webster Groves, Missouri (later known as Webster College, now known as Webster University), in 1915. The college in Denver lives on in the Loretto Heights School of Nursing at Regis University with its large nursing program. In 2012 the Sisters received the Civis Princeps award from Regis University, with mention of their founding 27 schools in Colorado, ten still in operation, including St. Mary‚Äôs Academy which bestowed the first high school diploma in the Colorado territory in 1875. In addition the Sisters founded 21 nonprofits in Colorado including Earthlinks, Project WISE, and the Women‚Äôs Bean Project.  Organization  In recent years, the institute has diffused into a larger Loretto Community, which includes the Loretto Sisters with vows and members without religious vows, as well as volunteers. These young adult volunteers serve in New York City, Washington, DC, and St. Louis, MO. In June 2005, the Loretto Community dedicated the Colorado affordable-housing community of Mount Loretto, built in collaboration with the Archdiocese of Denver. In order to advance its charitable activities, the group holds NGO status with the United Nations. Strongly committed to social justice, the Loretto Community opposes nuclear weaponry and proliferation, and advocates for migrant workers and torture victims of oppressive regimes. Other works of the Loretto Community include the Loretto Earth Network,. P.191. an environmentalist education and activism group.

Dealer tables at Auto Assembly Europe 2011. Simon Plumbe and Peter Cassel√∂, some of the organisers of Auto Assembly Europe 2011. Simon Furman, the guest of honour of Auto Assembly 2011, being interviewed by Lars Eriksson, one of the organisers. Founded in 2000 (though was in development since 1994 under the name Ia-Con) by Sven Harvey, Auto Assembly was a Transformers convention held in Birmingham, UK and run by the science-fiction fan organisation Infinite Frontiers. The first event was held in October 2000 and was held annually (except in 2002 and 2007 when it took \\"gap years\\") until the final event in 2015. The event was very originally called \\"The Auto-Assembly\\", and came to be referred to colloquially as \\"AA\\". Sven Harvey stepped down from his role with the event between the 2008 and 2009 conventions due to various issues unrelated to the event but has now returned to the team. Head of Infinite Frontiers Simon Plumbe is now the owner of the convention working with a team of volunteers. The convention started life as a small-scale event, intended to be an occasional Transformers equivalent of the meetings held by the Star Trek fan club Alpha Quadrant (which itself grew from the Delta Quadrant '96 convention run by Infinite Frontiers, headed by Simon Plumbe with Sven being on the committee.) The first event was expected to have a relatively small number of fans attending - smaller than the Star Trek meetings - although this figure was exceeded. Sven's original idea was to grow the meetings over time and then launch the Ia-con convention as an annual event based on the meetings, which originally were to be quarterly. \\"The Auto-Assembly\\" ran on 22 October 2000 and was run by Sven with Simon in a support administrative role.Convention Founder From the first meeting, however, the event grew rapidly and by the time the event reached 2003, \\"The Auto-Assembly\\" name, as was, was so strong a brand that Ia-con would have been a confusing move. Auto Assembly 2003, only the third event, had expanded to a full-scale convention, though at that point it was referred to as a Transformers Collectors Fair. The growth of the event and the friendliness of the fans in attendance actually converted Simon into a Transformers fan in the process. The convention attracts fans from all over the UK and Europe and as far afield as America and Australia and currently holds the European attendance record with 1064 fans attending Auto Assembly 2015 from the UK and Europe. The convention has a range of activities, including dealers tables, guest talks, autograph sessions, toy and art displays, video screenings, competitions, charity auctions, workshops (added for 2009) and more. Auto Assembly 2009 featured the convention's first live band as part of its programme ‚Äì former boy band turned rock band, Next of Kin. In association with sponsors every year, the convention also gives all of its attendees a \\"goodie bag\\" with complimentary gifts which have included a range of varied items, including postcards, comics, magazines, stickers, PlayStation 2 discs, posters, and even snacks. Regular guests at the convention have included Transformers comic writer Simon Furman, artists Andrew Wildman, Lee Sullivan, Geoff Senior, Simon Williams, and colourist Jason Cardy. Past voice actor guests have included Wally Wingert (Sideburn and Mirage from Transformers: Robots In Disguise) and Neil Kaplan (Optimus Prime and Ro-Tor, Transformers: Robots In Disguise), David Kaye (Megatron from Beast Wars, Beast Machines, Transformers: Armada, Transformers: Energon, Transformers: Cybertron and Optimus Prime in Transformers: Animated), G1 actor Dan Gilvezan in 2008 (Bumblebee) and for 2009 Beast Wars actor Ian James Corlett and G1 actor Gregg Berger. Auto Assembly: Target 2006, the 2006 convention inspired by the Marvel UK comic story of the same name, had the Auto Assembly debut appearances of artists Guido Guidi and Mike Collins, and the first UK appearance by its guest of honour voice actor David Kaye along with its regular comic guests. In March 2006, the convention expanded its activities further with the launch of the Auto Assembly Podcast which featured the normally expected chat and news updates, but also included interviews, competitions and - in a departure from other Transformers podcasts - music. The podcast was hosted by Simon Plumbe and Sven Harvey, who at the time ran the event. Auto Assembly 2008 was notable by having its first display from Hasbro featuring the unveiling of handmade resin versions of Transformers: Animated Optimus Prime, Megatron and Bulkhead being given away through a prize draw from an online competition. It also saw the world debut of the trailer for the Transformers: Animated game for the Nintendo DS from Activision. The convention also attracted a great deal of media attention and was attended by a television camera crew from Central News who filmed for a news broadcast, a radio broadcaster from BBC Radio WM attended, and a live interview with Sven Harvey for BBC Radio 5 Live took place early in the day. In November 2011, the first Auto Assembly Europe convention, the first Auto Assembly convention outside the UK, was held in Uppsala, Sweden, from 12 to 13 November. It was organised as a joint operation between the Auto Assembly organisers and the Nordic TransFans Association.Auto Assembly Europe official website In March 2015, it was announced that Auto Assembly 2015 would be the final Auto Assembly event due to conflicts with the health and personal lives of the team members at the time. Auto Assembly itself is continuing with other activities including the publication of its fanzine The Cybertronian Times. The convention has definitely come to an end now with TF Nation taking its place, but the Auto Assembly and Infinite Frontiers website continue, and the founder is running the Autobase Birmingham fan club in the city which is closely linked to the Spacedock Birmingham Star Trek fan club and is maintaining ties with Transmasters UK (TMUK). Ia-con is still in development. Convention Exclusives Each year the convention produces a full colour fanzine, The Cybertronian Times, which features articles, artwork, fiction and reviews covering all eras of Transformers.

The Auto Assembly Forum The Auto Assembly Forum is run by convention committee head Simon Plumbe, with the help of the moderators. The forum is not as busy as many of the larger Transformers forums, but is still a vibrant fan community. It was founded on 19 August 2003 following Auto Assembly 2003 to act as a support forum for the conventions, but it quickly developed into a thriving community all of its own. The forum was closed in the Summer of 2011 due to dwindling usage and was relaunched in September of the same year on a new server to coincide of the relaunch and redesign of the conventions website.

It is one of the twenty highest peaks in Alaska , and one of the fifty highest peaks in the United States. It can be considered a southern outlier of the large massif of Mount Bona. However, it is a much steeper peak than Bona, and presents significant climbing challenges of its own. The peak was named by Terris Moore during the first ascent of Mount Bona; the name refers to the University of Alaska. Climbing The first ascent of University Peak was in 1955, via the North Ridge. The leader was Keith Hart, University of Alaska. The party consisted of Gibson Reynolds, Columbia University, Leon Blumer, Sydney, Australia, Tim Kelley, University of Washington, Sheldon Brooks, Pacific Lutheran College and Norman Sanders, University of Alaska. The climbers started at the foot of the Hawkins Glacier, and negotiated a difficult icefall to gain a basin at around elevation, on the west side of the North Ridge. This is still the recommended easiest route, but now one can fly into the basin to avoid the icefall. This route is rated Alaska Grade 2+. A much harder route (Alaska Grade 5) was climbed on the East Face of the peak (from the Barnard Glacier) in 1997, by Carlos Buhler and Charlie Sassara. This East Face route, named \\"Third Semester\\", involves 8,500 feet (2,600 m) of 50-80 degree snow, ice and rock capped with a 300-foot (90 m) vertical ice cliff. The descent is via the North Ridge. The first ascent party, Charles Sassara and Carlos Buhler, took 6 days to complete the traverse, including 2 days of storm that prevented movement. Geology University Peak consists mainly of an eroded subvolcanic granodioritic intrusion that formed approximately 8.4 million years ago.

It was chartered in May 1834 and is now part of Capital One Bank. History The Bowery Savings Bank opened in 1834 at the site of what is now 128-130 Bowery in Manhattan. By 1980 it had over 35 branches located in the boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, as well as Nassau and Suffolk counties on Long Island. When bank deregulation was enacted the bank began to suffer losses as a result of rising savings account interest rates. By 1982 the bank was running out of cash; in 1985 the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) arranged for the bank to be sold to Richard Ravitch and others. It was sold for $100 million and allowed to maintain a capital deficit of $220 million rather than pay out on the $5 billion in deposits. In 1992 it was sold to H. F. Ahmanson & Co for $200 million. The name was changed by 1992 to Home Savings of America. In 1995, Ahmanson sold their New York operations to Greenpoint Savings Bank.

White's choice of a Roman classical style for the building, a first, set a trend for bank buildings, first in New York, and then across the United States. The exterior features Corinthian columns and sculpted pediments by Frederic MacMonnies, while the interior gives the impression of a Roman temple, and is said to be one of the great spaces in New York.White & Willensky with Leadon, p.93 It features the extensive use of marble, in the teller's counters -- which are made of yellow Siena marble -- the walls, and the mosaic floors. In addition, White employed faux marble scagliola columns, coffered ceilings and stairs and skylights made of cast iron. The exterior of the original building was designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission as an official city landmark in 1966, and the interior was given the same designation in 1994. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It is currently \\"Capitale\\", restaurant, night club and event space which is popular as a wedding site. In 2012, the connected building at 124 Bowery, designed by York & Sawyer and completed in 1902, was also designated a landmark.Postal, Matthew. \\"Bowery Bank of New York Building Designation Report\\" New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (June 26, 2012)  110 East 42nd Street  Former headquarters at 110 East 42nd Street, now a restaurant and event space The bank decided to move its headquarters in 1920, and a new building was constructed from 1921 to 1923 at 110 East 42nd Street between Park and Lexington Avenues across from Grand Central Terminal in Midtown Manhattan. It was designed by York and Sawyer in Italian Romanesque Revival style, with William Louis Ayres as the partner in charge.NYCLPC, p.107 The huge interior, which measures 65 feet high, 80 feet wide and 197 1/2 feet long, utilizes marble, limestone, sandstone and bronze screens to create a space reminiscent of a basilica. It has been called \\"one of the great spaces of New York.\\"White & Willensky with Leadon, p.314 A six- story addition to the east, which came to be called \\"The Chapel\\", was built in 1931‚Äì33. The building was designated a New York City landmark in 1996. The ground floor is now a Cipriani restaurant and upscale event space. Archives In April 2019, workers cleaning out a basement in Brooklyn discovered century-old records of the Bowery Savings Bank. Archivists moved rapidly to secure at least some of these records. While the historical value was not immediately known, a historian told The New York Times they could ‚Äúbe priceless‚Äù. In the 1920s Henry Miller wrote a short text about the architecture of this bank, in a short text he called mezzotint and whose title was A Bowery Phoenix.

He devised the Locher rack railway system and built his privately owned Pilatus Railway that uses this system. turnout consisting of a bridge that rotates about its lengthwise axle Locher rack system Locher rack system (seen from above) The Locher rack system, invented by Eduard Locher, has gear teeth cut in the sides rather than the top of the rail, engaged by two cog wheels on the locomotive. This system allows use on steeper grades than the other systems, whose teeth could jump out of the rack. It is used on the Pilatus Railway. Locher set out to design a rack system that could be used on gradients as steep as 1 in 2 (50%). The Abt system - the most common rack system in Switzerland at the time - was limited to a maximum gradient of 1 in 4 (25%). Locher showed that on steeper grade, the Abt system was prone to the driving pinion over-riding the rack, causing potentially catastrophic derailments, as predicted by Dr. Abt. To overcome this problem and allow a rack line up the steep sides of Mt. Pilatus, Locher developed a rack system where the rack is a flat bar with symmetrical, horizontal teeth. Horizontal pinions engage the centrally-mounted bar, both driving the locomotive and keeping it centered on the track. This system provides very stable attachment to the track, also protecting the car from toppling over even under the most severe crosswinds. Such gears are also capable of leading the car, so even flanges on running wheels are optional. The biggest shortcoming of the system is that the standard railway switch is not usable, and a transfer table or other complex device must be used where branching of the track is needed. Following tests, the Locher system was deployed on the Pilatus Railway, which opened in 1889. No other public railway uses the Locher system, although some European coal mines use a similar system on steeply graded underground lines.

The city was at the heart of much of the entire Western musical tradition. It was here that the Florentine Camerata convened in the mid-16th century and experimented with setting tales of Greek mythology to music and staging the result‚Äîin other words, the first operas, setting the wheels in motion not just for the further development of the operatic form, but for later developments of separate \\"classical\\" forms such as the symphony. History Pre-1450 Florence had a very important music history during the Italian Trecento and was one of the main centres of the Italian Ars nova. Civic music In Florence, the most substantial patron of music until the fall of the Republic was the city itself; therefore, music was primarily used as a symbol of the city's cultural achievements. Civic musicians first appeared in civic record starting in the 13th century. These musicians were all wind players and worked in civic ensembles. In 1383, Florence made clear subdivisions between its civic instrumental ensembles, singling out the pifferi (or piffero band) from the rest of the musicians. By 1390, three basic instrumental ensembles were all in clear formation: the pifferi (3 players), trombetti (trumpets 5-6 players), and the trombadori (8-10 players), including six large trumpets, 1 drummer, and a ciaramella player. The Pifferi Pifferaio by Bernardo Strozzi, Palazzo Rosso (Genova) The Pifferi provided music at important civic occasions, daily at the Palazzo Vecchio (City Hall), and private functions for the aristocratic families, especially the Medici. This group is commonly noted as the most sophisticated of the three groups. Sometimes this ensemble also played for religious services on the Virgil of the feast of the Blessed Virgin, Easter, and at solemn Matins on the Sundays when the image of the Mother of God was exhibited. In 1443, the Pifferi added a fourth member, so that the group included: 2 shawms, 1 bombard, and 1 trombone. As with the vocal performing groups, there was a strong preference for foreign musicians in these ensembles, especially for German trombonists. (German instrumentalists were known for both their strong performance proficiency as also their skills as improvisers.) When it was decided to hire a trombonist to join the pifferi forces, it was agreed to hire a German musician for this trombone position. When he was hired, officials subsequently fired the three native, Florentine shawm players and replaced them all with German speaking musicians. At this time, city officials also passed a motion declaring that only foreigners should hold positions in the pifferi. These positions generally ran in families: father to son, brother to brother. The addition of a 4th musician to the pifferi, and the funds needed for this addition, reflect the continual development of the group's musical repertory, as well as the ensemble's important function within Florentine culture. Toward the end of the 15th century, string music (especially that played on viols) became widely popular in Italy and all of Europe. But this development is not reflected in Florence's civic financial records; instead, the three civic ensembles were all well maintained and only continued to grow. For example, around 1510 the pifferi expanded to 5 players (3 shawms, 2 trombones). Only 10 years later, it expanded again to 6 musicians (4 shawms, 2 trombones). Life for civic musicians Life for the members of these groups was very comfortable. The government provided their musicians with clothing, housing, meals, right to name their successor, and the opportunity to supplement their wages. They were also the highest paid of public servants, and were allowed to dine in the private dining room at the Palazzo. Needless to say, these positions were prestigious and highly desirable. After retiring, they received a pension. The trombetti and pifferi could travel to other nearby cities, always representing Florence. But only on the most special of occasions did the three civic ensembles all play together. When the wave of humanism originated in Florence focused around Marsilio Ficino and his circles, there was a preference amongst the humanists for music performed for the bas groups: improvised poetry accompanied by soft instruments. However, this growing interest is not reflected in civic records. No bas musicians were being paid by the city for their music. During this time, however, the three main civic groups flourished, especially the pifferi. Festival music In addition to these important civic occasions, the city of Florence celebrated carnival twice annually. These festivals took place before Lent and during Calendimaggio, which celebrated the return of spring beginning on May 1 and ending on the feast day of John the Baptist, the patron saint of Florence. People from all classes of society gathered in the streets of Florence and participated in processions, parades, singing, dancing, and revelry. The evening festivities were particularly elaborate and involved collaboration between artists, poets, composers, and musicians. Their first task was to envision the concept and text for a carnival song (canti carnascialeschi) and then to present their creation on a float with costumes, singers, and musicians.William F. Prizer, \\"Reading Carnival: The Creation of a Florentine Carnival Song,\\" Early Music History 23 (2004): 192-193. A large portion of texts depicted a particular guild trade attempting to sell a product, and the mark of a good setting was in the poet‚Äôs employment of double entendre. For example, the Song of the Chimney Sweepers (or canzona de' spazzacamini) has a number of witty references: \\"Neighbours, neighbours, neighbours, who wants their chimneys swept? Your chimneys, signora? who wants them to be swept, swept inside and out, who wants them well cleaned, whoever can‚Äôt pay us just give us some bread or wine.\\"Translation taken from Patrick Macey, Bonfire Songs: Savonarola's Musical Legacy, Oxford Monographs on Music. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998), 46. Portrait of Lorenzo de'Medici by Agnolo Bronzino at the Uffizi in Florence Because carnival songs were primarily an oral tradition, only 300 texts have survived, and of these, about 70 contain music.Frank A. D‚ÄôAccone. \\"Canti carnascialeschi.\\" In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04767 (accessed December 12, 2008). Much of the repertory from the Laurentian period is preserved through the Italian devotional laude. These include the instruction cantasi come (translation: \\"to be sung to\\") followed by the title of a particular carnival song.Macey, Bonfire Songs, 33-34. One example of this is Lorenzo de' Medici's lauda, \\"O maligno e duro core\\", which is sung to \\"La canzona de' Valenziani\\" (Song of the Perfumers). In the later part of Lorenzo's life, more serious and philosophical texts were written, including his most famous poem, \\"Canzona di Bacco, ovvero Il trionfo di Bacco e Arianna\\" (Song of Bacchus, or The Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne). Devotional music As we have seen, the Italian lauda often shared the same music with the secular carnival song. However, the music grew out of a different and more spiritual tradition‚Äînamely the lay confraternities in Florence during the 12th and 13th centuries. These were groups of lay individuals that formed under the Dominican, Franciscan, and mendicant orders who devoted themselves to God, promoted the common good for themselves and the city, and practiced charitable works.Blake Wilson, Music and Merchants: the Laudesi Companies of Republican Florence. (Oxford:Clarendon, 1992). Several different types of Florentine devotional companies formed, but the ones that concern us musically are the laudesi companies. These companies organized their own liturgical services and also met each evening to sing laude in veneration of the Virgin Mary. Because the laude were sung by members of the company, they were originally monophonic and often in the poetic form of the ballata,Macey, Bonfire Songs, 50. but beginning in the 14th and early 15th centuries, singers were paid for their service, instrumentalists were hired, and the number of singers increased. By 1470 and continuing into the 16th century, the companies had established choirs of around five to eleven singers who could perform three- or four-part polyphony.Wilson, Music and Merchants, 141-149. The lauda's form and style varied according to the musical and poetic culture.Wilson, Music and Merchants, 165. Some of the chief poets included Lorenzo de' Medici and his mother Lucrezia Tornabuoni de‚Äô Medici, Feo Belcari, Francesco degli Albizzi, and Ser Michele Chelli. The musical style ranged from organal textures, simple note-against-note polyphony, works in the style of early Dufay, syllabic and homorhythmic declamation, and cantilena textures with supportive lower voices. Simple two-part settings were also prominent and could have been embellished or have included a third improvised part.Wilson, Music and Merchants, 165-169. Savonarola‚Äôs dominance at the end of the Cinquecento led to a prolific period for the lauda. He was a Dominican friar who sought to reform the church, preaching on repentance and foretelling Florence as the New Jerusalem. Adamantly opposed to the activities of carnival, he deputized his followers and the fanciulli (boys and adolescents) to sing laude throughout the streets during the festival season. Because of his outspoken criticisms, he was excommunicated by the pope and executed. A major source for the lauda is Serafino Razzi‚Äôs Libro primo delle laudi spirituali published in 1563. Razzi was a Dominican friar who promoted Savonarola‚Äôs veneration. His anthology contains 91 musical settings for 1-4 voices and transmits 180 lauda texts. Much of what we know about both the lauda and the carnival song repertory from the 15th century comes out of this important source. Patronage of music Several kinds of musical patronage existed in Florence during the 15th and early 16th centuries, with respect to both sacred and secular music: state, corporate, church, and private.Frank D'Accone, Lorenzo il Magnifico and Music‚Äù In Lorenzo il Magnifico e il suo mondo. Convegno Internazionale di Studi, Firenze, 9-13 giugno 1992, edited by Gian Carlo Garfagnini, 259-290, Istituto Nazionale di Studi sul Rinascimento. Atti di Convegni, XIX (Florence: Olschki, 1994), 260 State patronage The Herald was one position supported by the Florentine government. Heralds performed music during the twice-daily meals for the Signoria, held in the Palazzo Vecchio. One type of songs which heralds performed were canzoni morali, or moral songs. Many of the Herald's songs would have likely been improvised because their subjects would have often been transitory, such as current events.Timothy McGee, \\"Dinner Music for the Florentine Signoria, 1350-1450\\" Speculum 74 (1999): 98. Perhaps the best example of state patronage in Florence is the patronage of the civic groups, the trombadori, trombetti, and pifferi. Originally, the trombadori and the Herald served as the performers for public ceremonies. After the 1370s, the two other groups were added. Like the Herald, these two groups played a role both in public ceremony and the daily meals of the Signoria. The government also patronized the civic groups to provide the music required to honor visiting dignitaries. The civic musicians thus served a particular and necessary role in the complex system of rituals followed for visitors. In some cases, state and church patronage of music overlapped, such as when the Florentine government had the civic musicians perform for church services, for example when they performed at Orsanmichele on feast days. Florence Baptistery Corporate patronage In Florence, the guilds were responsible for the upkeep and business of the Florence Cathedral, and the Florence Baptistery. Particularly, the Arte della lana, the wool guild, was responsible for the cathedral, and the Arte della calimala, the cloth guild, for the Baptistry. In addition to other responsibilities, these guilds oversaw the establishment and maintenance of the chapel that sang for services at these two institutions, as well as later at Santissima Anunnziata. A chapel was established as early as 1438, although polyphonic music had been performed at the cathedral for at least thirty years prior. It is believed that the Medici were responsible for, or at least involved in, the creation and continuation of the polyphonic chapel in Florence. Cosimo de' Medici is credited with arranging the creation of the chapel, not because of documents supporting this, but rather because his name does not appear in any of the documents surrounding the chapel's founding, but as such a prominent figure, it seems unlikely he would not have been involved in the process.Frank A. D‚ÄôAccone, \\"The Singers of San Giovanni in Florence During the 15th Century.\\" Journal of the American Musicological Society 14 (1961): 309. Further, when the chapel was disbanded at some point between 1458 and 1464, Cosimo was given the authority to reestablish a chapel with his own funds.Frank A. D‚ÄôAccone, \\"The Singers of San Giovanni in Florence During the 15th Century.\\" Journal of the American Musicological Society 14 (1961): 320. During the period of Savonarola's influence, from about 1493‚Äì1498, the chapel was disbanded again. However, polyphonic music was returned to the cathedral soon after Savonarola's arrest; records show musicians were engaged to perform by April 27, 1498. The chapel was reestablished by December 1, 1501. It is important to note that the chapel was restored in 1501 during the Medici's exile from Florence. It is clear, then, that other forces in Florence besides the Medici were concerned with the chapel. In addition to patronage of the chapels, certain of the guilds also provided support for some of the confraternities in Florence, which performed laude. Private Outside of Florence, most major centers had a court and a system of nobility, such as the Dukes of Ferrara, the Este, the Sforza in Milan, etc. In these cases, the ruler kept his own musicians for his personal use, for military purposes or for religious services, or simply entertainment. However, in Florence, such a court did not exist until the establishment of the Medici as Dukes of Florence in 1532. Wealthy Florentine families, such as the Strozzi family, employed musicians for private use, but without the same level of display or extravagance that would be found in ducal or princely courts. Private patronage also appears in carnival songs. The city's inhabitants themselves served as patrons of certain kinds of music, such as the bench singers, or cantimpanca. A particular singer would often have a regular time and place for his performances ‚Äì some even had sheets printed with the lyrics to the songs they would perform; these performers were also known for their ability to improvise. Florentines also patronized music through their bequests, through which they arranged to have laude and masses sung on their behalf during services held by the various Florentine laudesi companies. Church Florence Cathedral The church itself supported some musicians through benefices. Musicians tried to attain the best benefices during their careers, as well as gathering more than one. In this way, musicians could guarantee their continued financial support. However, because benefices included an ecclesiastical post, married musicians could not benefit from them. Also, political turmoil, such as war or the seizure of lands, could interfere with the payment of benefices to a recipient. Church patronage of music can also be seen in the musical training given to boys who were educated at ecclesiastical institutions. They received education in grammar and music in return for singing with the chapel when needed. Patronage and the Medici The connection between the Medici and music patronage in Florence is a complex one. Although there is no evidence that the Medici directly paid any of the Florentine public musicians, it is possible that the Medici had an arrangement with the pifferi whereby the group performed for the Medici without having to request their services through normal channels.Timothy J. McGee, \\"In the Service of the Commune: The Changing Role of Florentine Civic Musicians, 1450-1532,\\" Sixteenth-Century Journal 30 (1999): 742. A similar belief is held in the relationship between the Medici and the chapel; the Medici, beginning with Cosimo, may have given the chapel singers financial support in addition to the pay they received from the Cathedral and the Baptistery.Frank A. D‚ÄôAccone, \\"The Singers of San Giovanni in Florence During the 15th Century.\\" Journal of the American Musicological Society 14 (1961): 312. Regardless of whether the family did so, it is clear that certain of the Medici influenced the selection of musicians for the chapels at the Cathedral and Baptistry, as well as playing a role in bringing musicians to Florence and, in some cases, finding them financial support. The various types of patronage in Florence, then, most often were implemented as a means of bringing honor to either the city itself, its religious institutions, or both. Private patronage also served as a reflection of the patron's own wealth and standing. Despite the differences in government between Florence and the courts at Ferrara, Milan, and elsewhere, the motivations behind the patronage of music were quite similar. Patrons, whether dukes or guilds men, used music and musicians to demonstrate either their own wealth and prestige, or that of their city or institution. The groups of musicians who represented the honor of the city or cathedral not only had to exist, but their quality reflected on the city as well. For this reason, patrons sought to employ the best musicians, and competition over singers or other performers was common. Song and instrumental music A Florentine Chansonnier from the Time of Lorenzo the Magnificent A Florentine Chansonnier from the Time of Lorenzo the Magnificent (Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, compiled in Florence, c. 1490-1491) opens with Johannes Martini's work, and other works by him regularly alternates with those of Heinrich Isaac in the first nineteenth items. The opening repertoire has been interpreted as a \\"contest\\" between the two composers.Howard Mayer Brown, ed. A Florentine Chansonnier from the Time of Lorenzo the Magnificent: Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, MS Banco Rari 229, Monuments of Renaissance Music (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983). Isaac has been long regarded as a composer with strong ties to Florence and the Medici from the mid-1480s, whereas there is no surviving evidence connecting Martini with Florence. Martini, indeed, was a prominent court musician in Ferrara, employed by the Este from 1473 until his death in the late 1490s. Martini and Florence Perhaps Martini's music could have reached Florence during the 1480s.Lewis Lookwood,‚ÄúMusic at Florence and Ferrara in the Late Fifteenth Century: Rivalry and Interdependence,‚Äù in La musica a Firenze al tempo di Lorenzo il Magnifico: congresso internazionale di studi, Firenze, 15-17 giugno, 1992, ed. by Piero Gargiulo (Firenze: L. S. Olschki, 1993):1-13. Martini traveled to Rome in 1487. During that trip, he could have stopped in Florence, because the city served as a normal stopover along the route from Ferrara to Rome.Lockwood,‚ÄúMusic at Florence and Ferrara,\\" 1-13. Martini's brother Piero joined the choir of the Florentine Cathedral and Santissima Annunziata from 1486 to 1487.Frank D‚ÄôAccone, \\"The Singers of San Giovanni in Florence During the 15th Century,\\" Journal of the American Musicological Society, 14 (1961): 307-358. Martini's trip to Rome could easily have included a stopover in Florence to visit his brother. Connections between Ferrara and Florence Ferrara-Florence connections are supported by the shared repertoire between Florentine and contemporary Ferrarese manuscript, Cas.Lookwood, ‚ÄúMusic at Florence and Ferrara,‚Äù4-6. Cas is a major selection of what was available in Ferrara in the 1470s, compiled around 1480, about a decade earlier than 229. Despite a periodic gap between the two, a larger number of concordances suggest the spread of common material in the two important centers from which the manuscripts originated. In the case of Martini, it is not surprising that Martini's eight works in the opening contest section of Fl 229 also appear in Cas.Lookwood,‚ÄúMusic at Florence and Ferrara,‚Äù6. The two cities have a long- standing history of musical competition. Ferrara served as a place for recruitment of singers for the Baptistry in Florence (established in 1438).D'Accone, \\"The Singers of San Giovanni.‚Äù Throughout the eras of Lorenzo de'Medici (1466‚Äì1492) and Ercole I d'Este (1471‚Äì1505), musicians travelled and forged the ties to both cities. For instance, the singer Cornelio di Lorenzo in Ferrara moved to Florence in 1482, where he was serving as a member of Santissima Annunziata.Lockwood, ‚ÄúMusic at Florence and Ferrara,\\" 2. He also maintained his position as a musical agent for Ercole. After his return to Ferrara, he continued contact with Florence. La Martinella Another example of such a connection is compositions of Martini and Isaac, entitled La Martinella. Both compositions are textless, and perhaps originally conceived as instrumental pieces, called \\"free fantasia.\\" Brown, A Florentine Chansonnier, 91. The title probably refers to the composer himself, Martini.Brown, A Florentine Chansonnier, 90-91. It is quite plausible that Isaac reworked Martini's Martinella for his setting of the same title. This is supported by the chronological relationship between the two pieces as well as shared thematic material and structure.Allan Atlas' studied of interrelationships between manuscripts in his critical notes of Rome, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, C.G.XIII.27, and the Dissemination of the Franco-Netherlandish Chanson in Italy, c. 1460-c. 1530, Ph.D., (New York University, 1971). Martini's work is written no later than the mid-1470s. Isaac had arrived in Florence around 1485 when Maritni's was probably circulated in the city. Isaac's was written no earlier than the mid-1480s.Atlas' critical notes of Rome, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, C.G.XIII.27. Comparing these two compositions, Martini's Martinella consists of two nearly equal sections, like the majority of his secular works.Theodore Karp,‚ÄúThe Secular Works of Johannes Martini,‚Äù in Aspects of Medieval and Renaissance Music; a Birthday Offering to Gustave Reese, ed. by Martin Bernstein, Hans Lenneberg, [and] Victor Yellin (New York, W. W. Norton [1966]), 460. The first section opens with an expansive duet between superius and tenor, followed by a shorter duet for tenor and contratenor. Next, a tutti for all three voices is interrupted by a series of short imitative duets. The short characteristic phrase, indeed, is one of the main stylistic traits of Martini.Karp,‚ÄúThe Secular Works,\\" 461. Isaac seems to extensively borrow material from his model, but recomposes it. He reuses the melodic material from Martini in the opening and concluding sections as well as several places of his setting, yet with motivic elaboration. For instance, Isaac's opening phrase is based on the initial material of Martini, expanding the initial duet into three-part texture in imitation.Brown, A Florentine Chansonnier, 90-91. In addition, a series of short motives is exchanged between various pairs of voices. This is a similar technique to that which Martini used in the same part of the form, although Isaac did not borrow any explicit melodic material from his model.Brown,‚ÄúEmulation, Competition, and Homage: Imitation and Theories of Imitation in the Renaissance,‚ÄùJournal of the American Musicological Society, 35, no. 1 (1982): 1-48. He also preserves the structural proportion of Martini, including the same number of measures and nearly equal two sections. In the first section just after the opening phrase, particularly, Isaac follows the sequence of two duets, tutti, alternation between short motives, and tutti. The technique of short motives in imitation is also indebted to Martini's. It is likely that Martini stimulated Isaac's interest in reworking three-part polyphonic instrumental music through Martinella. The opening section of the Florentine manuscript may suggest the interrelationships between Martini and Isaac, and by extension, between Ferrara and Florence. The link of Martini and Isaac is strongly suggestive through the composition Martinella. It is not coincidence that Isaac chose Martinella's piece as a model for one of his pieces. During his visit, Martini may have influenced Isaac with regard to the compositional techniques, styles, and procedure portrayed in his Martinella. The two may have worked together, which in turn is possibly reflected in the impressive opening section, alternating the works between the two. Humanism and music Given this environment of collaboration among institutions and classes of society, it is worth considering the relationship between music and Renaissance humanism, one of the primary intellectual strands active in Quattrocento Florence. Humanism arose as a literary movement in Italy during the late 13th century and flowered in the 15th, particularly in the city of Florence. Humanists were initially identified as professors or students of the studia humanitatis, the curriculum of core subjects that formed the foundation of the humanists' education; these included grammar (i.e. Latin), rhetoric, poetry, history, and moral philosophy. Classicism was the basis for their studies: humanists drew on the discoveries and revival of ancient Greek and Latin authors and attempted to imitate them in content, style, and form.Paul Oskar Kristeller, Renaissance Thought and the Arts: Collected Essays (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1980). By 1600, humanism had come to affect nearly every discipline-every discipline, that is, except music. The common view has been that music lagged behind other fields such as the plastic arts, and, indeed, the application of humanism to music has been the subject of considerable debate. Only a few fragments of ancient Greek music were known during the 15th century, and, as very few humanists comprehended the notation, the sounding music of the ancients could not be revived in the same way as their literature. Yet there are a number of ways in which music can be understood as humanist. Portrait of Pico della Mirandola by Cristofano dell'Altissimo, Uffizi Gallery, Florence Although the music of the ancients could not be recovered, their theories and attitudes about it could. Due in part to the collection efforts by Florentines such as Niccolo Niccoli (c. 1364-1437) and Pico della Mirandola (1463‚Äì94), much classical Greek and Latin music theory was known and studied during the 15th century. Humanists noted that the ancient authors had ascribed powerful effects to music and advocated that contemporary music too should move the affections of listeners. To this end, 15th-century theorists tried to understand the way in which ancient Greek music was constructed, including the concepts of mode and harmony, and apply it to modern music. The metaphor of the harmony in music as a representation of the universal harmony between man and cosmos or between body and soul was a particularly appealing one, prominently figuring in the writings of humanists, including the Florentine Neoplatonist Marsilio Ficino (1433‚Äì99).Claude Palisca, Humanism in Italian Renaissance Musical Thought (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1985). Another manner of defining humanistic music regards a union of word and tone. One of the ways in which humanism exerted its influence on other disciplines was to encourage greater attention to clarity or elegance of style. This led to experiments with music that mirrored a text's syllable lengths, accents, and meaning. Guillaume Dufay (1397‚Äì1474), who spent time in Florence in the 1430s and wrote the motet \\"Mirandas parit\\" for the city, includes classical subjects and praise for Florence in a Latin text that employs a quantitative meter-all recognizable characteristics of humanistic writing. Moreover, Dufay uses a number of musical devices to explain and amplify the meaning of the text, in much the same way as a humanistic orator would employ rhetorical figures to decorate a speech.Willem Elders, \\"Humanism and Early Renaissance Music: A Study of the Ceremonial Music by Ciconia and Dufay,\\" Tijdschrift van de Vereniging voor Nederlandse Muziekgeschiedenis 27 (1977): 65-101. Finally, there is the issue of the type of music that the humanists themselves cultivated. Very little of the literature by the humanists mentions contemporary art music.Nino Pirrotta, ‚ÄúMusic and Cultural Tendencies in 15th-Century Italy,‚Äù Journal of the American Musicological Society 19 (1966): 127-61. It does, however, include descriptions of an improvisatory tradition, particularly the singing of poetry to the accompaniment of a lyre or other stringed instrument. Such accounts typically take an effusive tone, calling on classical images of Orpheus or the Muses and emphasizing the rhetorical nature of the performance.Alberto Gallo, Music in the Castle: Troubadours, Books, and Orators in Italian Courts of the 13th, 14th, and 15th, Centuries (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1995). Venues and activities A wave of urban expansion in the 1860s led to the construction of a number of theaters in Florence. Currently, the sites, activities, and musical groups is impressive. They include: * Teatro Comunale, seat of the Orchestra del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino and the main site of concerts in the series of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, a music festival the name of which recalls the presumed folk music festivals of the Middle Ages that are speculated to have been one of the sources for early opera * Teatro della Pergola * the Fiesole School of Music ('), open to all ages‚Äîan attempt to encourage amateur and semi-professional musical activity * Centro di Ricerca e di Sperimentazione per la Didattica Musicale * Teatro Verdi, seat of the Tuscany Symphony Orchestra * Teatro Goldoni * Luigi Cherubini music conservatory, also home to an impressive Museum of Musical Instruments * the music manuscript collection in the National Central Library * a great number of churches that host musical performances. Furthermore, the town of Empoli in the province hosts the Busoni Center for Musical Studies, and Fiesole has an ancient Roman theatre that puts an annual summer music festival.

Biography The son of Richard B. Mellon, nephew of Andrew W. Mellon, and grandson of Thomas Mellon, he and his sister Sarah Mellon Scaife and cousins Paul Mellon and Ailsa Mellon-Bruce, were heirs to the Mellon fortune, which included major holdings in Mellon Bank, Gulf Oil, and Alcoa. In 1957, when Fortune prepared its first list of the wealthiest Americans, it estimated that the four cousins were all amongst the richest eight people in the United States, with fortunes of between $400 million and $700 million dollars each. R.K. Mellon served as president and chairman of Mellon Bank. He also served on the board of trustees of the University of Pittsburgh over a span of several decades and was a major benefactor to the university. Military Service Mellon served in the United States Army in both world wars and remained active in the United States Army Reserve, receiving the Distinguished Service Medal and rising to the rank of Lieutenant General. Urban Renewal He is chiefly remembered for his urban renewal efforts in Pittsburgh, undertaken in an unlikely bipartisan (Mellon was a lifelong Republican) partnership with the city's postwar Democratic mayor David L. Lawrence. After returning to the city following World War II, Mellon developed an interest in improving Pittsburgh's severe flooding, pollution, and urban blight. Under the auspices of the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA), massive demolition and redevelopment projects transformed the city, backed politically by Lawrence and financially by Mellon and his companies. Mellon also used his economic power to push companies and landowners to comply with new regulations. In 1955 a redevelopment plan and federal funding were approved to coincide with the construction of a new civic arena (1961-2010). The URA, with the support of R. K. Mellon, callously displaced 8,000 residents, businesses and churches. Government-funded demolition destroyed the fabric of the African American community of the Lower Hill District. During the four decades, which followed the demolition, dozens of acres of land remained vacant. http://www.hilldistrict.org/developers,accessed 3/29/2018; Bob Bauber, triblive, Jan. 22, 2013; Byron W. Woodson Sr., A President in the Family, (Westport, CT, Praeger, 2001),145. Mellon served as Vice President of American Council to Improve Our Neighborhoods, an organization to promote for- profit private urban renewal projects. Family He married Constance Prosser McCaulley, daughter of a New York banker, in 1936. They adopted four children: Richard P. Mellon, Seward Prosser Mellon, Constance Barber Mellon, and Cassandra Mellon Milbury. Richard King Mellon was also the primary financial founder of Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College, then known as the School of Urban and Public Affairs. Foundation The Richard King Mellon Foundation manages his charitable estate and has recently participated in redeveloping industrial brownfields in Pittsburgh. Maurepas Swamp WMA In 2001 the foundation donated two tracts of land, totaling 61,633 acres, to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) for the Maurepas Swamp WMA. Between 2001 and 2011 another 12,000 acres were gained through purchases and donations. In 2012 another 29,630 acres (The MC Davis Tract) was acquired from The Conservation Fund. Subsequent acquisitions of the Rathborne, Boyce, and Crusel tracts now gives the WMA 122,098 acres that all began with the Mellon Foundation donation.Maurepas Swamp WMA - Louisiana Department of Wildlife & Fisheries, Retrieved 2016-08-07 References * People, TIME, August 14, 1939 * Fitzpatrick, Dan. \\"The story of urban renewal,\\" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette May 21, 2000 * Obituary External links * Pittsburgh Green Story: Richard King Mellon * Richard King Mellon Foundation Category:Businesspeople from Pittsburgh Category:Mellon family Category:American people of Scotch-Irish descent Category:1899 births Category:1970 deaths Category:Pennsylvania Republicans Category:United States Army generals Category:People from Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania Category:Military personnel from Pennsylvania Category:American racehorse owners and breeders ","title":"Richard King Mellon"},{"id":"4536355","text":"Yves-Fran√ßois-Marie-Aim√© Urvoy (1900‚Äì1944) was a French army officer and historian whose work has focused on French colonial holdings in Africa.

The Royal Oak Township location shares the Greater Media tower with WCSX, WRIF & WMGC. Its low frequency and strongly directional daytime signal give the station good coverage of the Detroit market, despite the lower power. WRDT is owned by Crawford Broadcasting. History The station went on the air in 1956 as WMIC, owned by McIntyre Broadcasting, and originally featured a block programmed variety format, including some rock and roll programs. In 1959, the station was purchased by Dick Jones, Ross Mulholland and the Brink family, and its calls were changed to WQTE. Originally, WQTE aired what would now be called an Adult Contemporary music format, but in 1960 the station made a shift to all-out Top 40, dubbing itself \\"Cutie Radio\\" and \\"Fabulous 56\\" and issuing a survey called \\"The Cutie Music Meter.\\" The Production Director was the well-known Bob Bennett, who became General Manager of Bob Hope's station WBMJ in San Juan. WQTE personalities during this time included Tom Clay (who emceed popular dances for the station at Cobo Hall), and Ed McKenzie, best remembered to Detroit audiences as \\"Jack the Bellboy\\" on WJBK radio in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Also heard on WQTE during this time was Ralph Binge and Eddie Chase. After a year of competing against WJBK, WXYZ, WKMH and, to a lesser extent, CKLW, for the ears of Detroit's teen audience, WQTE gave up on Top 40 and changed to an Easy Listening/MOR format, becoming a modest success - the Early Morning announcer was Roy Blair who later joined WJBK-TV. Early rock and roll music would once again be heard on AM 560. In 1974, new owners Greater Media switched WQTE from Easy Listening to Oldies of the 1950s and 1960s as, \\"Honey Radio,\\" shadowcasting WHNE (94.7 FM); call letters were changed to WHND on March 28, 1975. \\"Honey Radio\\" was one of the first all-oldies stations in the nation and specialized in music from the first generation of rock and roll (1956‚Äì63), including, and especially, doo-wop, and featuring a playlist incorporating records that never made, or scored low on, the national charts in addition to the big hits of that era. WHND, like its FM counterpart, was completely automated in the first several years of its existence (using a syndicated format from Drake-Chenault called \\"Classic Gold\\"), but the station went live and local in 1978 under the guidance of consultant Paul Christy. It took a few years for everything to gel, but by 1987, \\"Honey\\" had become not only an oldies station, but a re-creation of the sound of early 1960s Top-40 radio - the closest thing to be found today is XM Radio's \\"'60s On 6.\\" Oldies fans loved WHND for its announcers, whom they perceived to be as passionate about the music as they themselves were, and for their strong community presence, with frequent remotes and \\"cruise\\" broadcasts around the area. Initially, \\"Honey Radio\\" programming was also heard on sister station WHNE-FM 94.7, but in 1976, Greater Media changed format of the FM to Adult Contemporary as \\"Magic\\" WMJC. (94.7 is now owned by Beasley Broadcast Group as Classic rock WCSX.) \\"Honey\\" continued as a standalone format on AM 560 for almost two more decades. The legendary Freddy Fortune was employed by Honey Radio. WHND picked up competition from a number of FM oldies stations during the late 1980s, including WKSG (102.7), CKLW-FM (93.9) and WOMC (104.3), with WOMC eventually coming to dominate in the format. As the station became a virtually invisible presence on the Detroit radio dial, the station dropped its local programming and switched to Satellite Music Network's \\"Kool Gold\\" format. On December 2, 1994, \\"Honey Radio\\" came to an end, as Greater Media began to broker time on the station to local Spanish-language broadcasters. On April 1, 1996, WHND changed its calls to WLLZ, picking up the calls dropped by Detroit's 98.7 FM after its change from Rock to Smooth Jazz as WVMV. The format remained brokered Spanish. Finally, in June 1997, Greater Media sold WLLZ to Crawford, who changed the format to Christian Talk as AM 560, The WMUZ Word Station (not IDing with the call letters, but with a positioner tying the station to Crawford's flagship contemporary Christian FM, WMUZ-FM 103.5). The call letters were changed to WRDT on August 11, 2003. The station remained in AM Stereo even after the end of the oldies format. The WHND calls are now used by a Wisconsin Public Radio news-and-classical-music station in Sister Bay, Wisconsin. The WLLZ calls were reassigned to an LP (low power) TV station on channel 12 in the Traverse City area shortly after AM 560 dropped them, which held the call sign from 2003 to 2017 (it is now WXII-LP). WRDT's programming today consists chiefly of syndicated and brokered Christian talk shows such as Focus on the Family and Dave Ramsey, with a few local shows such as \\"On The Word\\" with Pastor Emery Moss, and \\"Night Vision\\" with Pastor George Bogle. For a short period of time, WRDT's programming was repeated on Detroit-based translator W296DY. However, on April 13, 2018, Cumulus Media filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission regarding interference with the signal of their Ann Arbor-based WQKL. After operating for a short period at reduced power, Crawford Broadcasting took W296DY silent on April 24, 2018.

Until 2006 it was used as the Civil Defence School. The building, which dates from the early 19th century, was originally known as the Little Lodge. From 1876, it became the official residence of the Private Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, who lived out of season in the next door Viceregal Lodge. Its first resident in this capacity was Lord Randolph Churchill, who was appointed as Private Secretary by the then Lord Lieutenant, his father John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough. Churchill lived there with his wife Lady Randolph Churchill and his young son Winston Churchill. Winston Churchill in his writings described his four years, from the ages of two to six, spent in the Little Lodge as among the happiest of his life. It was claimed that he developed his interest in the military from watching military parades at the Lodge. Following Irish independence in 1922 the house was used for some years by staff of the Governor-General of the Irish Free State before becoming the official residence of Adjutant General of the Irish Army, Major General Brennan between 1926 and 1940. It was the last Irish state residence to be connected to the ESB grid, eventually becoming connected in 1937. In 1945, the wheelchair-using retiring first President of Ireland, Douglas Hyde was judged too ill to return to his Roscommon country house, Ratra. It was decided instead to move him into the vacant residence in the grounds of the Lodge (then renamed √Åras an Uachtar√°in). Hyde named the residence Little Ratra in honour of his old home. Hyde died there in 1949. On 18 June 1951 it became the headquarters of the newly formed Irish Civil Defence and renamed Ratra House. The Irish Civil Defence School was relocated to Roscrea, County Tipperary in 2006, but Ratra House remains in use as an administrative building. Parts of the complex are still used by the Civil Defence, such as the purpose-built training range used by firemen and rescue personnel. Today, Ratra House is the headquarters of Gaisce ‚Äì The President's Award.

The SPSR formerly ran a total of , with main track from Benson to Paul Spur, a location about west of Douglas, as well as the Bisbee Branch which ran to Bisbee, Arizona. The SPSR is owned by Ironhorse Resources. The SPSR commenced operations in November 2003 after David Parkinson acquired the San Pedro and Southwestern Railway from RailAmerica in 2003 with \\"the intent of restoring transborder rail service with the Mexican rail system at Naco, Arizona, and developing North American Free Trade Agreement-related traffic, but that this plan never materialized.\\" David Parkinson had owned several other shortlines in the western US, such as the California Northern Railroad, under his ParkSierra Rail Group, which was sold in 2002 to RailAmerica, which was purchased by Genesee & Wyoming in 2012. SWKR's traffic was weak and consisted of coal and coke for Chemical Lime, the only on-line shipper. Chemical Lime only generated between 380 and 500 carloads per year which SWKR claimed was inadequate to sustain the railroad. SWKR decided to abandon the line south of Curtiss in March 2005 due to limited freight business and the lack of prospects for future traffic increases. On February 3, 2006 the Surface Transportation Board (STB) authorized abandonment of the line (STB Docket #AB-1081-0-X). However, on February 13, 2006, Sonora- Arizona International (SAI) filed an offer of assistance with the STB, to acquire the line for $5.6 million. On July 18, 2006, the Cochise County Board of Supervisors declined to write a letter suggesting the line be converted to a trail, saying investors should be given sufficient time to arrange reactivating the line.Sierra Vista Herald, July 19, 2006. History The SPSR traces its history back to May 24, 1888, when the Arizona and South Eastern Railroad (A&SE;) was incorporated with headquarters at Bisbee, Arizona. Bisbee was a booming mining town that by the 1890 census was the 6th largest city in Arizona. In 1888 Arizona & Southeastern built a line southward along the San Pedro River from a connection with the Southern Pacific Railroad at Benson to Bisbee. The A&SE; track partially paralleled the New Mexico and Arizona Railroad (NM&A;) that was built six years earlier (1882) on the opposite side of the San Pedro River from Benson to Fairbank. The NM&A; then went southwest to Nogales via Sonoita and Patagonia. On June 17, 1902, the Arizona & Southeastern was sold to the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad (EP&SW;) and the line was extended through Douglas to El Paso. On November 1, 1924, the EP&SW; was leased to the Southern Pacific. In 1955 the EP&SW; was merged into the SP. At that time, four of SP's five daily passenger trains used the route via Douglas with only one via Bowie; but by 1966, the line east of Douglas into New Mexico was abandoned. From Paul Spur to Douglas was abandoned in the 1990s. 200px On June 15, 1992, SP sold the line to Kyle Railways and commenced operations as the San Pedro & Southwestern Railway (SWKR). For several years starting in 1995, the SWKR ran an excursion train from Benson to Charleston. In 1997, the track was abandoned from Paul Spur to Curtiss. On January 22, 1997, the SWKR was acquired by StatesRail but continued to operate as the SWKR. On January 7, 2002, the SWKR was acquired by RailAmerica. The San Pedro Railroad Operating Company (SPROC) commenced operations in November 2003 when it purchased the San Pedro & Southwestern Railway (SWKR) from RailAmerica. The SPROC later filed for abandonment of the southern portion of the line. The STB approved abandonment of the entire line by SPROC on February 6, 2006. SAI made an offer of financial assistance to the STB, and was granted the option of ownership of the line on May 3, 2006. The STB ruled that the Offer of Financial Assistance (OFA) deal of the agreed upon price of $5.6 million for the SPROC railroad line from Curtiss to Naco and Paul Spur must close on or before July 12, 2006. On July 12, 2006, the attorneys for the Sonora-Arizona International LLC re-filed with the STB that they were withdrawing their OFA and that the SAI would no longer be purchasing the railroad line. The San Pedro Railroad Operating Company then refiled on July 13 to ask for approval to immediately abandon the line. The STB's decision is pending. Removal of the rails, ties and related infrastructure began in early 2007 south of Curtiss to Paul Spur. In October 2018, the line was sold by ARG Transportation Services to Ironhorse Resources and renamed the San Pedro Valley Railroad.Ironhorse Resources acquires Arizona short line Railway Gazette International October 18, 2018 References    * External links *Official site Category:Arizona railroads Category:Switching and terminal railroads Category:Companies operating former Southern Pacific Transportation Company lines Category:Railway companies established in 2003 Category:San Pedro Valley (Arizona) Category:2003 establishments in Arizona ","title":"San Pedro Valley Railroad"},{"id":"4536388","text":"L√ºchow (Wendland) () is a city in northeastern Lower Saxony, in Germany. It is the seat of the Samtgemeinde (\\"collective municipality\\") L√ºchow (Wendland), and is the capital of the district L√ºchow-Dannenberg. Situated approximately 13 km north of Salzwedel, L√ºchow is located on the German Framework Road. In the Polabian language, L√ºchow is called Ljauch√ºw (Lgauchi or Lieusch√º in older German reference material). In L√ºchow one can find the Stones Fan Museum.

The only remnant of the fortifications built to defend in the late Middle Ages is a tower, which was adapted and used as a bell tower by St John's Church. A gate was erected in 1555 which divided the city centre from its western suburbs; this gate was demolished in 1793. L√ºchow suffered from an outbreak of the Plague in 1537, and barely half a century later, in 1589, was largely destroyed by fire. Another fire in 1608 destroyed much of what had been rebuilt.

He is a martial arts master who first appeared in Dragon's Fists, a novel by Dennis O'Neil and Jim Berry, starring Richard Dragon. His first DC Comics appearance was in Richard Dragon Kung Fu Fighter #1. Fictional character biography In the year 1895 a Japanese army captain stationed in Manchuria faced a Chinese captive in unarmed combat. Fearing his superior officer would lose the battle, a Japanese soldier shot the captive in the middle of the fight. This horrified the captain, who condemned the action, asserting that disgrace had been brought upon the entire Japanese army for this act. To atone, the captain honored the dying man's final request, pledging himself to take the man's place.Detective Comics Annual 01 (1989) In memory of the victim, the captain began studying ancient scriptures, practicing the ancient disciplines, becoming a master in many ways. He lived a life pure in its austerity, its discipline and, finally, in its harmony. In 1900 he refused a plea from his wife to return to Japan. He agreed to her last request: \\"Promise your bones will rest with mine\\". Almost 100 years later, the O-Sensei, as he was now called, had opened a dojo (in Japan, Pre-Crisis, although its location is not stated Post-Crisis and may have still been in China) and was teaching a young student named Ben Turner. One night a thief named Richard Dragon attempted to rob the dojo, but was caught and subdued by Turner. O-Sensei saw a spark in young Richard, and took him in. Bringing out a goodness that lay beneath their surface rage, O-Sensei trained Richard and Ben as brothers; in the space of six years the O-Sensei would create two of the greatest martial artists in the DC Universe. Once he felt there was nothing more he could teach them, the O-Sensei left the two. Turner and Dragon would join the service of a law-keeping organization known as G.O.O.D. (Global Organization of Organized Defense), occasionally seeking out their sensei's assistance and advice. At one point the two warriors came into conflict with Lady Shiva, one of O-Sensei's god-daughters, who had been tricked into believing Dragon had killed her sister. Weary of being defeated by the likes Batman and Wonder Woman, the villainous Doctor Moon had begun work on cultivating his own elite super-human guardians, opening \\"Dr. Moon‚Äôs Athletic Academy\\" in Brooklyn, whittling down the students to the strongest specimens and enhancing their strength artificially. His soldiers would be defeated by Dragon, Turner, and Shiva, which enraged Moon. Determined to tap into Dragon's strength he and his warriors travelled to China and, after a harrowing battle, captured the O-Sensei with the intention of forcing him to reveal all of his martial arts secrets. Despite agonizing torture, the old master remained defiant, promising his captors that \\"when I have died, I shall gladly answer your questions\\". By chance, Dragon and Shiva had come to the Chinese monastery seeking the O-Sensei‚Äôs help in reviving a comatose Ben Turner. Despite the surprise visit, Moon‚Äôs troops rallied and managed to incapacitate Shiva. Meanwhile, Dragon found himself up against a martial artist that Moon had discovered in San Francisco‚ÄîSing, a one-time student of the late Bruce Lee. After watching the two men fight to a draw, Moon pulled out a gun to shift the odds back in Sing‚Äôs favor: \\"I admire Dragon. I was convinced Sing would break him. Yet Dragon is forever interfering with my plans. I slay him with great regret\\". Before he could fire, Moon was rendered unconscious when the O-Sensei applied nerve compressions to his neck. Eventually, more than 150 years old, the O-Sensei decided he had lived long enough. Aided by Shiva, now the most feared martial arts assassin in the world, he asked Batman, The Green Arrow, and The Question to aid him in returning to Japan, in order to fulfill the vow he had made to his wife decades ago. Before Shiva and the others could return him to Japan, however, a typhoon washed the O-Sensei from his boat. Shortly afterwards, Lady Shiva learned that his wife had been lost at sea decades ago. Thus, the O-Sensei had fulfilled his vow. In other media O-Sensei will appear in the animated film Batman: Soul of the Dragon voiced by James Hong.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/batman-soul-dragon-sets- voice-cast-1306722  References  See also *O-Sensei - A title often used to refer to Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of aikido Category:DC Comics martial artists Category:Comics characters introduced in 1975 Category:Characters created by Dennis O'Neil Category:Fictional martial arts trainers ","title":"O-Sensei (comics)"},{"id":"4536411","text":"Hugh III (fl. late tenth century), called Albus (the White), was the third Lord of Lusignan, probably the son and successor of Hugh II.

NEMSA's membership consists of emergency medical technicians (EMTs), and paramedics.  History  The National Emergency Medical Services Association (NEMSA) was founded in 2004 when dissatisfaction with union representation led to the creation of an all-EMS union. NEMSA's founding has always been a source of controversy, as founder Torren Colcord was found guilty in Alameda County (CA) Superior Court of fraud, using Service Employee International resources and company time to create and form NEMSA. \\"It's a substantial judgment for substantial wrongdoing,\\" said Dan Martin, administrative vice president for SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West. \\"They were on payroll, supposed to be looking out for members, and they did just the opposite. It's an example of what happens when people put their own personal ambitions above the interests of the union.\\" SEIU was awarded a $442,000 judgement against Colcord, and later Colcord retained the guilty verdict but had the award reduced $300,000 on appeal. NEMSA members later paid for that judgement, plus attorney fees for the appeals case. NEMSA supporters claimed that rather than a large union that paid no attention to EMS; they wanted a union that was for EMS, by EMS. NEMSA reported that represented 5672 members as a maximum number of members represented according to Federal LM-2 reports. The Sacramento Business Journal reported that NEMSA represented 5500 members at one point. NEMSA promotes itself as \\"a registered labor union and not-for-profit mutual benefit corporation that specializes in the labor representation of pre-hospital EMS Professionals such as EMTs, Paramedics, Dispatchers, Call Takers, Critical Care Nurses, Air Ambulance Flight Nurses and Paramedics, as well as EMS related support staff.\\" NEMSA represents members in 6 states.  Membership changes  Beginning in 2007, under the leadership of President Torren Colcord, NEMSA began to see dramatic changes in membership. In 2007, after difficult contract negotiations in Portland, Oregon, NEMSA disclaimed the Portland, Oregon bargaining unit, walking away from representing approximately 500 EMS workers there instead of having their recently negotiated contract rejected. NEMSA under the leadership of Colcord lost another 1000-1500 East Coast members when those members opted to leave NEMSA in favor of the Teamsters and United EMS Workers-AFSCME Local 4911 in 2009 and 2012 In 2011, NEMSA under the leadership of Colcord lost 140 members in Solano County CA in favor of United EMS Workers-AFSCME Local 4911 In 2012, NEMSA under the leadership of Colcord lost 260 members in Santa Clara County CA in favor of United EMS Workers-AFSCME Local 4911 NEMSA under the leadership of Colcord lost another 2000 members in Northern California in 2012 when those members opted to leave NEMSA in favor of United EMS Workers-AFSCME Local 4911 after a coast to coast victory. NEMSA under the leadership of Colcord lost another 140 members in Northern California at First Responder EMS Inc of Sacramento in favor of United EMS Workers-AFSCME Local 4911. NEMSA under the leadership of Colcord lost another 75 members in Northern California at American Medical Response in favor of IAFF. NEMSA under the leadership of Colcord lost another 350 members in New Haven CT at American Medical Response in favor of IAEP. NEMSA lost another 500 members to NAGE in San Diego CA at Rural Metro. NEMSA lost another 30 members from Morrow County EMS to IAEP in Mt. Gilead, Ohio.  Leadership dispute and formation of breakaway union  In 2010, a dispute over Torren Colcord's leadership of NEMSA led to a long running dispute over who controlled NEMSA. In the 2010 a union officer election was held. NEMSA refused to recognize the validity of one candidate and did not allow the candidate to run for office. That candidate, Jimmy Gambone then ran a national write in ballot campaign. According to the Department of Labor, Gambone was eligible to run for office and should have been placed on the ballot. Gambone was the winner of the election by a large majority of write in votes, Larry Lucus had the second highest and Torren Colcord had the least. According to the Department of Labor, NEMSA violated federal law in refusing to seat the winning candidate. NEMSA instead seated another candidate for President, who promptly resigned. Torren Colcord, NEMSA's outgoing President, still refusing to relinquish any power, was named Executive Director and remained in control of NEMSA. New bylaws were secretly drafted after the election to allow for the Executive Director Position to be created. The DOL investigation and resolution to the complaint took nearly two years. During the time period the complaint was investigated by the Department of Labor, Gambone and his supporters, broke in to the NEMSA offices bringing with them mattresses, boxes of food, cameras to record live with no means to shower for the week they burglarized the office. The local police were called but the burglary was given a thumbs up from the local sheriffs department. Files stolen from the burglars included NEMSA employees private financials including bank routing numbers, SSN‚Äôs, home addresses and phone numbers. Gambone and his ilk made phone calls to the employees threatening their lives, finances and employment. The employees in turn had to contact their local police departments, lifelock and feared for their families safety. and left the NEMSA offices with computers, files, and information. Gambone and his supporters then seized power, naming themselves the NEMSA Board of Directors and unilaterally unseating the existing NEMSA Board of Directors. Gambone and his agents then began conducting business as NEMSA while the NEMSA Board of Directors Gambone had unseated also continued conducting business as NEMSA. According to NEMSA, Gambone supporters attempted to intercept dues checks, write checks on NEMSA's bank accounts, and do business as NEMSA during this time Gambone and his supporters went on to continue working for a rival union, United EMS Workers or UEMSW where he was later deemed unfit and fired.  Financial condition  Federal LM-2 financial reports required for labor Unions show NEMSA's financial condition as of the end of the 2012 fiscal year for NEMSA. The 2012 report shows NEMSA claimed $12.372.00 in cash on hand and assets totaling $91,338.00 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013. However, NEMSA also reports total liabilities of $695,236.00 including $231,997.00 unpaid in accounts payable. This leaves NEMSA with total net assets of negative $-603,898.00.  Business practices and legal proceedings  NEMSA hired the law firm of Goyette and Associates. In legal documents filed in Sacramento Superior Court, Paul Goyette alleges he was hired as corporate counsel to NEMSA in May 2010 at hourly rates from $225 to $250 an hour. The arrangement changed in April 2011 to a fixed monthly fee of $45,000 for legal and labor representation, plus an hourly fee of $250 for political and criminal defense work. The deal included acknowledgment that $146, 872 was due from the first agreement, but the law firm agreed not to take action to collect the money unless NEMSA altered or terminated the new agreement before March 2014. If that happened, court documents allege, the money was immediately due ‚Äî plus $600,000 in liquidated damages. The money wasn‚Äôt paid and the relationship was severed by NEMSA in May 2012. In court documents filed in July, Goyette seeks to collect the more than $825,000 he says is owed. NEMSA affiliated with NAGE (National Association of Government Employees) in 2012. The affiliation did not protect NEMSA from losing the Northern California Bargaining Unit. NAGE has since severed the affiliation and filed suit against NEMSA for breach of several contracts, claiming NEMSA did not pay NAGE more than $281,000 owed to NAGE as part of those contracts. The suit also alleges that Torren Colcord breached an employment contract with NAGE. In the suit, NAGE alleges \\"Shortly after NEMSA‚Äôs affiliation with NAGE commenced, NAGE discovered that NEMSA‚Äôs financial health was not what it was represented to be during the course of NEMSA‚Äôs negotiations with NAGE, and, consequently, NEMSA did not have the financial wherewithal to meet its dues obligations to NAGE. In an effort to salvage the relationship, NAGE initially agreed to rebate to NEMSA some of the dues owed to NAGE under the Affiliation Agreement to NEMSA. In all, NAGE rebated approximately $56,000 to NEMSA. NAGE also paid NEMSA an additional $15,000 in rent pursuant to the Servicing Agreement. NAGE also performed all of the obligations and services called for under the Affiliation and Servicing Agreements prior to the termination of those agreements. Nonetheless, despite financial assistance from NAGE, and despite that NAGE has met its obligations to NEMSA under the Affiliation and Servicing Agreements, NEMSA failed to meet its financial obligations to NAGE. Of the approximately $456,000 total owed by NEMSA to NAGE pursuant to the Affiliation and Servicing Agreements, NEMSA paid NAGE only approximately $175,000 and currently owes NAGE approximately $281,000.  Politics  NEMSA claims it does not advocate or recommend specific political candidates or parties, nor does it participate in politics.  Critics  EMS workers in Portland, Oregon are critical of NEMSA because NEMSA disclaimed their bargaining unit when NEMSA could not negotiate an acceptable contract for their workforce. NEMSA walked away from approximately 500 members, leaving them unrepresented. \\"Everybody was upset,\\" Charlie Savoie said. \\"A faction figured maybe we'd been had, and began collecting petitions to file for new representation by the Teamsters.\\" Former NEMSA member Edward Gavin, Jr. filed a lawsuit against NEMSA in 2011 claiming NEMSA had breached its duty of fair representation owed to Gavin under law. Gavin alleges \\"On July 8, 2011 Mr. Gavin found out that at the Step Two grievance hearing he had briefly attended, NEMSA had withdrawn his grievance rather than allowing a decision to be made. The withdrawal of the grievance at the Step Two stage of the grievance process prevented the grievance from being taken to Step Three of the process, arbitration. As a result of the grievance being withdrawn by NEMSA, Mr. Gavin lost the opportunity to have the NEMSA stewards decide whether to take the grievance to arbitration, he lost the opportunity to appeal any decision by NEMSA not to take the grievance over his termination taken to arbitration, he lost the opportunity to have his grievance taken to arbitration, and he lost the opportunity to contest the termination of his employment. The NEMSA representatives had lied to Mr. Galvin after the Step Two hearing, when they led him to believe that the grievance hearing had been litigated to conclusion and awaited a decision. Mr. Gavin had never agreed to the withdrawal of the grievance. EMS workers in Northern California and New England are critical of NEMSA because of a two year union leadership dispute. Leaders of this anti-NEMSA movement called themselves \\"the Transition Team\\" and are quoted on an anti-NEMSA website as saying \\"NEMSA - NEMSA is corrupt & undemocratic.. It is run more like a despotic personal business\\" and issued a 35-page preliminary report of the problems they found with NEMSA and NEMSA's Executive Director Torren Colcord. Later this Transition Team would abandon NEMSA and create a new union, as a local affiliate of AFSCME called United EMS Workers Local 4911 Former NEMSA employees have also been critical of NEMSA. Former NEMSA Employee Jim Misercola wrote a letter describing why he no longer works for NEMSA in which he states \\"My resignation is due to the extreme philosophical and ideological differences with NEMSA. NEMSA is no longer the organization that I once tirelessly promoted. Furthermore it is my opinion that NEMSA is badly mismanaged by its current President Torren Colcord\\". Former Co-Founder Tim Bonifay also stated in a letter \\"I helped create NEMSA because I believed in what the organization could achieve. But the NEMSA out campaigning today is not the one that I co-founded, and I would be ashamed to be a part of that organization today.\\" NEMSA members, as reported by EMS Insider have been critical of NEMSA due to NEMSA not providing Board of Directors meeting minutes and/or financial information about NEMSA upon request, in addition to getting poor representation. Many cases that should have made it to arbitration never did.

They are Iceland's most successful singer/songwriter girl-band, producing ten number one singles, three number one studio albums, one number one compilation and one number one DVD in Iceland. History  2004‚Äì2005: 100% Nylon and G√≥√∞ir Hlutir The group was formed after auditions in Iceland, which Alma, Camilla and Klara attended. A few weeks after the auditions, Emilia was asked whether she would like to be in the band, and after meeting them, she accepted the offer. The group sings pop music in English and Icelandic. Their first single, \\"L√∂g Unga F√≥lksins\\" (which means \\"Songs of the Youth\\" in English), was released in April 2004 and went straight to number one. The group have had huge success in their native country of Iceland: achieving a total of 13 Number 1 singles to date, a TV show about their first summer as a girlband, three chart topping albums, and a book entitled \\"100% Nylon\\" (which instantly became a best seller). They have also released a DVD entitled \\"Nylon Allsta√∞ar\\", which contained their smash hit TV show as well as other bonus features. Nylon have released three albums in Iceland, the two Icelandic language albums being titled G√≥√∞ir Hlutir and 100% Nylon. Both albums went straight to number one. Their third album (and first English effort) 100% Nylon, or plainly Nylon in Iceland, features many exclusively English songs as well as many re-written Icelandic tracks. Nylon have also worked with many artists in Iceland for various collaborations. They are featured on an Icelandic Christmas album titled J√≥laskraut, released Christmas 2005. Another notable collaboration the band has done would be \\"Fur√∞uverk\\", on one of the biggest selling children albums of all time, St√≥ra Stundin Okkar. Many of the group's singles have also been featured on various compilation albums.  2006‚Äì2007: Nylon and international success  Nylon released their debut UK single \\"Losing A Friend\\" (written by English songwriters, Chris and Tony Griffiths, ex The Real People) on 10 July 2006. It reached number 29 in the UK Top 40 singles chart, was Woolworths' single of the week upon release, and also hit number one on The Box's famed Box Breakers chart. Nylon have supported Westlife, Girls Aloud, McFly and Journey South on all of their UK tours. On the latter, Klara had become ill and the band had to pull out last minute and return to Iceland. The follow-up to \\"Losing A Friend\\" was a double A-Side single; \\"Closer\\", another Griffiths composition, and a cover of the Eurythmics classic \\"Sweet Dreams\\". The video for \\"Closer\\" was being rotated on 'The Box' and, as \\"Losing A Friend\\" did, reached #1 on the Box Breakers chart. The single was released on October 23. Although it had previously made #1 in Iceland, it failed to reach the top 40 in the UK. Although, \\"Sweet Dreams\\" did receive much attention from clubs, making it #1 on the Commercial Dance Charts in the UK for an entire week. The April release of \\"Holiday\\", the band's last single with all four bandmembers, went straight to number one and was on the top of the Icelandic Chart for over a month. \\"Holiday\\" went on to be one of the girl's biggest selling singles ever.  2007‚Äì2008: Emilia's departure, 100% Nylon and break The UK release of \\"100% Nylon\\", originally announced for October 2006, was then planned for February 2007 but was cancelled and shelved when Emilia Bjorg, a founding member of the group, left the band in late summer of 2007. The news, announced on their official website a day after the press had reported the story, came shortly after a swarm of press over Emilia getting married. With Nylon's upcoming schedule, it is rumoured that the reason Emilia left the band was to spend time with her husband rather than traveling the world with the band. Emilia and the rest of the girls are still on fantastic terms, with Emilia still heading out to the occasional Nylon concert. In 2007, as a trio, the group release a Best Af, album in Iceland this November 2007 featuring all of their past singles, videos, and new single \\"Holiday\\" (with Emil√≠a yet) and \\"Shut Up\\" reaching two #1. In 2008 the group returned to Iceland and announced the disband. They said they missed family in Iceland ‚Äì the group moved to UK when released their third album. The Charlies Em 2011 Klara Elias, Alma Goodman and Camilla Stones formed a spin-off new group named The Charlies. The group released only one single, \\"Hello Luv\\", but failed to sign a new contract with a label. On January 17, 2015 they disbanded.

Babylonian astronomy was the study or recording of celestial objects during early history Mesopotamia. These records can be found on Sumerian clay tablets, inscribed in cuneiform, dated to around 1000 BCE. In conjunction with their mythology, the Sumerians developed a form of astronomy/astrology that had an influence on Babylonian culture. Therein Planetary gods played an important role. Babylonian astronomy seemed to have focused on a select group of stars and constellations known as Ziqpu stars. These constellations may have been collected from various earlier sources. The earliest catalogue, Three Stars Each, mentions stars of the Akkadian Empire, of Amurru, of Elam and others.History of the Constellations and Star Names ‚Äî D.4: Sumerian constellations and star names? , by Gary D. Thompson A numbering system based on sixty was used, a sexagesimal system. This system simplified the calculating and recording of unusually great and small numbers. The modern practices of dividing a circle into 360 degrees, of 60 minutes each, began with the Sumerians. During the 8th and 7th centuries BC, Babylonian astronomers developed a new empirical approach to astronomy. They began studying and recording their belief system and philosophies dealing with an ideal nature of the universe and began employing an internal logic within their predictive planetary systems. This was an important contribution to astronomy and the philosophy of science, and some modern scholars have thus referred to this novel approach as the first scientific revolution.D. Brown (2000), Mesopotamian Planetary Astronomy-Astrology, Styx Publications, . This approach to astronomy was adopted and further developed in Greek and Hellenistic astrology. Classical Greek and Latin sources frequently use the term Chaldeans for the astronomers of Mesopotamia, who were considered as priest-scribes specializing in astrology and other forms of divination. Only fragments of Babylonian astronomy have survived, consisting largely of contemporary clay tablets containing astronomical diaries, ephemerides and procedure texts, hence current knowledge of Babylonian planetary theory is in a fragmentary state. Nevertheless, the surviving fragments show that Babylonian astronomy was the first \\"successful attempt at giving a refined mathematical description of astronomical phenomena\\" and that \\"all subsequent varieties of scientific astronomy, in the Hellenistic world, in India, in Islam, and in the West ‚Ä¶ depend upon Babylonian astronomy in decisive and fundamental ways.\\" The origins of Western astronomy can be found in Mesopotamia, and all Western efforts in the exact sciences are descendants in direct line from the work of the late Babylonian astronomers. Modern knowledge of Sumerian astronomy is indirect, via the earliest Babylonian star catalogues dating from about 1200 BC. The fact that many star names appear in Sumerian suggests a continuity reaching into the Early Bronze Age. Old Babylonian astronomy \\"Old\\" Babylonian astronomy was practiced during and after the First Babylonian dynasty (ca. 1830 BCE) and before the Neo-Babylonian Empire (ca. 626 BCE). The Babylonians were the first to recognize that astronomical phenomena are periodic and apply mathematics to their predictions[citation needed]. Tablets dating back to the Old Babylonian period document the application of mathematics to the variation in the length of daylight over a solar year. Centuries of Babylonian observations of celestial phenomena were recorded in the series of cuneiform tablets known as the En√ªma Anu Enlil‚Äîthe oldest significant astronomical text that we possess is Tablet 63 of the En√ªma Anu Enlil, the Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa, which lists the first and last visible risings of Venus over a period of about 21 years. It is the earliest evidence that planetary phenomena were recognized as periodic. An object labelled the ivory prism was recovered from the ruins of Nineveh. First presumed to be describing rules to a game, its use was later deciphered to be a unit converter for calculating the movement of celestial bodies and constellations. Babylonian astronomers developed zodiacal signs. They are made up of the division of the sky into three sets of thirty degrees and the constellations that inhabit each sector. The MUL.APIN contains catalogues of stars and constellations as well as schemes for predicting heliacal risings and settings of the planets, and lengths of daylight as measured by a water clock, gnomon, shadows, and intercalations. The Babylonian GU text arranges stars in 'strings' that lie along declination circles and thus measure right- ascensions or time intervals, and also employs the stars of the zenith, which are also separated by given right-ascensional differences. There are dozens of cuneiform Mesopotamian texts with real observations of eclipses, mainly from Babylonia. Planetary theory The Babylonians were the first civilization known to possess a functional theory of the planets. The oldest surviving planetary astronomical text is the Babylonian Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa, a 7th-century BCE copy of a list of observations of the motions of the planet Venus that probably dates as early as the second millennium BCE. The Babylonian astrologers also laid the foundations of what would eventually become Western astrology. The Enuma anu enlil, written during the Neo-Assyrian period in the 7th century BCE, comprises a list of omens and their relationships with various celestial phenomena including the motions of the planets. Cosmology In contrast to the world view presented in Mesopotamian and Assyro-Babylonian literature, particularly in Mesopotamian and Babylonian mythology, very little is known about the cosmology and world view of the ancient Babylonian astrologers and astronomers. This is largely due to the current fragmentary state of Babylonian planetary theory, and also due to Babylonian astronomy being independent from cosmology at the time. Nevertheless, traces of cosmology can be found in Babylonian literature and mythology. In Babylonian cosmology, the Earth and the heavens were depicted as a \\"spatial whole, even one of round shape\\" with references to \\"the circumference of heaven and earth\\" and \\"the totality of heaven and earth\\". Their worldview was not exactly geocentric either. The idea of geocentrism, where the center of the Earth is the exact center of the universe, did not yet exist in Babylonian cosmology, but was established later by the Greek philosopher Aristotle's On the Heavens. In contrast, Babylonian cosmology suggested that the cosmos revolved around circularly with the heavens and the earth being equal and joined as a whole. The Babylonians and their predecessors, the Sumerians, also believed in a plurality of heavens and earths. This idea dates back to Sumerian incantations of the 2nd millennium BCE, which refers to there being seven heavens and seven earths, linked possibly chronologically to the creation by seven generations of gods.  Omens  It was a common Mesopotamian belief that gods could and did indicate future events to mankind. This indication of future events were considered to be omens. The Mesopotamian belief in omens pertains to astronomy and its predecessor astrology because it was a common practice at the time to look to the sky for omens. The other way to receive omens at the time was to look at animal entrails. This method of recovering omens is classified as a producible omen, meaning it can be produced by humans, but sky omens are produced without human action and therefore seen as much more powerful. Both producible and unproducible omens however, were seen as messages from the gods. Just because gods sent the signs didn't mean that Mesopotamians believed their fate was sealed either, the belief during this time was that omens were avoidable. In mathematical terms, the Mesopotamians viewed omens as ‚Äúif x, then y‚Äù, where ‚Äúx‚Äù is the protasis and ‚Äúy‚Äù is the apodosis. The relationship Mesopotamians had with omens can be seen in the Omen Compendia, a Babylonian text composed starting from the beginning of the second millennium on-wards. It is the primary source text that tells us that ancient Mesopotamians saw omens as preventable. The text also contains information on Sumerian rites to avert evil, or ‚Äúnam-bur-bi‚Äù. A term later adopted by the Akkadians as ‚Äúnamburbu‚Äù, roughly, ‚Äú[the evil] loosening‚Äù. The god Ea was the one believed to send the omens. Concerning the severity of omens, eclipses were seen as the most dangerous. The Enuma Anu Enlil is a series of cuneiform tablets that gives insight on different sky omens Babylonian astronomers observed. Celestial bodies such as the Sun and Moon were given significant power as omens. Reports from Nineveh and Babylon, circa 2500-670 B.C.E., show lunar omens observed by the Mesopotamians. \\"When the moon disappears, evil will befall the land. When the moon disappears out of its reckoning, an eclipse will take place\\".  Astrolabes  The astrolabes (not to be mistaken for the later astronomical measurement device of the same name) are one of the earliest documented cuneiform tablets that discuss astronomy and date back to the Old Babylonian Kingdom. They are a list of thirty-six stars connected with the months in a year. Generally considered to be written between 1800-1100 B.C.E.. No complete texts have been found, but there is a modern compilation by Pinches, assembled from texts housed in the British Museum that is considered excellent by other historians who specialize in Babylonian astronomy. Two other texts concerning the astrolabes that should be mentioned are the Brussels and Berlin compilations. They offer similar information to the Pinches anthology, but do contain some differing information from each other. The thirty-six stars that make up the astrolabes are believed to be derived from the astronomical traditions from three Mesopotamian city-states, Elam, Akkad, and Amurru. The stars followed and possibly charted by these city-states are identical stars to the ones in the astrolabes. Each region had a set of twelve stars it followed, which combined equals the thirty-six stars in the astrolabes. The twelve stars of each region also correspond to the months of the year. The two cuneiform texts that provide the information for this claim are the large star list ‚ÄúK 250‚Äù and ‚ÄúK 8067‚Äù. Both of these tablets were translated and transcribed by Weidner. During the reign of Hammurabi these three separate traditions were combined. This combining also ushered in a more scientific approach to astronomy as connections to the original three traditions weakened. The increased use of science in astronomy is evidenced by the traditions from these three regions being arranged in accordance to the paths of the stars of Ea, Anu, and Enlil, an astronomical system contained and discussed in the Mul.apin.  MUL.APIN  Mul.apin cuneiform tablet MUL.APIN is a collection of two cuneiform tablets (Tablet 1 and Tablet 2) that document aspects of Babylonian astronomy such as the movement of celestial bodies and records of solstices and eclipses. Each tablet is also split into smaller sections called Lists. It was comprised in the general time frame of the astrolabes and Enuma Anu Enlil, evidenced by similar themes, mathematical principles, and occurrences. Tablet 1 houses information that closely parallels information contained in astrolabe B. The similarities between Tablet 1 and astrolabe B show that the authors were inspired by the same source for at least some of the information. There are six lists of stars on this tablet that relate to sixty constellations in charted paths of the three groups of Babylonian star paths, Ea, Anu, and Enlil. there are also additions to the paths of both Anu and Enlil that are not found in astrolabe B.  Relationship of calendar, mathematics and astronomy  The exploration of the Sun, Moon, and other celestial bodies affected the development of Mesopotamian culture. The study of the sky led to the development of a calendar and advanced mathematics in these societies. The Babylonians were not the first complex society to develop a calendar globally and nearby in North Africa, the Egyptians developed a calendar of their own. The Egyptian calendar was solar based, while the Babylonian calendar was lunar based. A potential blend between the two that has been noted by some historians is the adoption of a crude leap year by the Babylonians after the Egyptians developed one. The Babylonian leap year shares no similarities with the leap year practiced today. it involved the addition of a thirteenth month as a means to re- calibrate the calendar to better match the growing season. Babylonian priests were the ones responsible for developing new forms of mathematics and did so to better calculate the movements of celestial bodies. One such priest, Nabu- rimanni, is the first documented Babylonian astronomer. He was a priest for the moon god and is credited with writing lunar and eclipse computation tables as well as other elaborate mathematical calculations. The computation tables are organized in seventeen or eighteen tables that document the orbiting speeds of planets and the Moon. His work was later recounted by astronomers during the Seleucid dynasty.  Aurorae  A team of scientists at the University of Tsukuba studied Assyrian cuneiform tablets, reporting unusual red skies which might be aurorae incidents, caused by geomagnetic storms between 680 and 650 BCE. Neo-Babylonian astronomy Neo-Babylonian astronomy refers to the astronomy developed by Chaldean astronomers during the Neo- Babylonian, Achaemenid, Seleucid, and Parthian periods of Mesopotamian history. A significant increase in the quality and frequency of Babylonian observations appeared during the reign of Nabonassar (747‚Äì734 BCE). The systematic records of ominous phenomena in Babylonian astronomical diaries that began at this time allowed for the discovery of a repeating 18-year Saros cycle of lunar eclipses, for example. The Greco-Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy later used Nabonassar's reign to fix the beginning of an era, since he felt that the earliest usable observations began at this time. The last stages in the development of Babylonian astronomy took place during the time of the Seleucid Empire (323‚Äì60 BCE). In the 3rd century BCE, astronomers began to use \\"goal-year texts\\" to predict the motions of the planets. These texts compiled records of past observations to find repeating occurrences of ominous phenomena for each planet. About the same time, or shortly afterwards, astronomers created mathematical models that allowed them to predict these phenomena directly, without consulting past records. Arithmetical and geometrical methods Though there is a lack of surviving material on Babylonian planetary theory, it appears most of the Chaldean astronomers were concerned mainly with ephemerides and not with theory. It had been thought that most of the predictive Babylonian planetary models that have survived were usually strictly empirical and arithmetical, and usually did not involve geometry, cosmology, or speculative philosophy like that of the later Hellenistic models, though the Babylonian astronomers were concerned with the philosophy dealing with the ideal nature of the early universe. Babylonian procedure texts describe, and ephemerides employ, arithmetical procedures to compute the time and place of significant astronomical events. More recent analysis of previously unpublished cuneiform tablets in the British Museum, dated between 350 and 50 BCE, demonstrates that Babylonian astronomers sometimes used geometrical methods, prefiguring the methods of the Oxford Calculators, to describe the motion of Jupiter over time in an abstract mathematical space. In contrast to Greek astronomy which was dependent upon cosmology, Babylonian astronomy was independent from cosmology. Whereas Greek astronomers expressed \\"prejudice in favor of circles or spheres rotating with uniform motion\\", such a preference did not exist for Babylonian astronomers, for whom uniform circular motion was never a requirement for planetary orbits. There is no evidence that the celestial bodies moved in uniform circular motion, or along celestial spheres, in Babylonian astronomy. Contributions made by the Chaldean astronomers during this period include the discovery of eclipse cycles and saros cycles, and many accurate astronomical observations. For example, they observed that the Sun's motion along the ecliptic was not uniform, though they were unaware of why this was; it is today known that this is due to the Earth moving in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with the Earth moving swifter when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion. Chaldean astronomers known to have followed this model include Naburimannu (fl. 6th‚Äì3rd century BCE), Kidinnu (d. 330 BCE), Berossus (3rd century BCE), and Sudines (fl. 240 BCE). They are known to have had a significant influence on the Greek astronomer Hipparchus and the Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy, as well as other Hellenistic astronomers. Heliocentric astronomy The only surviving planetary model from among the Chaldean astronomers is that of the Hellenistic Seleucus of Seleucia (b. 190 BCE), who supported the Greek Aristarchus of Samos' heliocentric model.William P. D. Wightman (1951, 1953), The Growth of Scientific Ideas, Yale University Press p.38. Seleucus is known from the writings of Plutarch, Aetius, Strabo, and Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi. The Greek geographer Strabo lists Seleucus as one of the four most influential astronomers, who came from Hellenistic Seleuceia on the Tigris, alongside Kidenas (Kidinnu), Naburianos (Naburimannu), and Sudines. Their works were originally written in the Akkadian language and later translated into Greek. Seleucus, however, was unique among them in that he was the only one known to have supported the heliocentric theory of planetary motion proposed by Aristarchus,Seleucus of Seleucia (ca. 190-unknown BCE), ScienceWorld where the Earth rotated around its own axis which in turn revolved around the Sun. According to Plutarch, Seleucus even proved the heliocentric system through reasoning, though it is not known what arguments he used. According to Lucio Russo, his arguments were probably related to the phenomenon of tides.Lucio Russo, Flussi e riflussi, Feltrinelli, Milano, 2003, . Seleucus correctly theorized that tides were caused by the Moon, although he believed that the interaction was mediated by the Earth's atmosphere. He noted that the tides varied in time and strength in different parts of the world. According to Strabo (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to state that the tides are due to the attraction of the Moon, and that the height of the tides depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun. According to Bartel Leendert van der Waerden, Seleucus may have proved the heliocentric theory by determining the constants of a geometric model for the heliocentric theory and by developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model. He may have used trigonometric methods that were available in his time, as he was a contemporary of Hipparchus. None of his original writings or Greek translations have survived, though a fragment of his work has survived only in Arabic translation, which was later referred to by the Persian philosopher Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (865-925). Babylonian influence on Hellenistic astronomy Many of the works of ancient Greek and Hellenistic writers (including mathematicians, astronomers, and geographers) have been preserved up to the present time, or some aspects of their work and thought are still known through later references. However, achievements in these fields by earlier ancient Near Eastern civilizations, notably those in Babylonia, were forgotten for a long time. Since the discovery of key archaeological sites in the 19th century, many cuneiform writings on clay tablets have been found, some of them related to astronomy. Most known astronomical tablets have been described by Abraham Sachs and later published by Otto Neugebauer in the Astronomical Cuneiform Texts (ACT). Herodotus writes that the Greeks learned such aspects of astronomy as the gnomon and the idea of the day being split into two halves of twelve from the Babylonians. Other sources point to Greek pardegms, a stone with 365-366 holes carved into it to represent the days in a year, from the Babylonians as well. Since the rediscovery of the Babylonian civilization, it has been theorized that there was significant information exchange between classical and Hellenistic astronomy and Chaldean. The best documented borrowings are those of Hipparchus (2nd century BCE) and Claudius Ptolemy (2nd century CE). Early influence Some scholars support that the Metonic cycle may have been learned by the Greeks from Babylonian scribes. Meton of Athens, a Greek astronomer of the 5th century BCE, developed a lunisolar calendar based on the fact that 19 solar years is about equal to 235 lunar months, a period relation that perhaps was also known to the Babylonians. In the 4th century BCE, Eudoxus of Cnidus wrote a book on the fixed stars. His descriptions of many constellations, especially the twelve signs of the zodiac show similarities to Babylonian. The following century Aristarchus of Samos used an eclipse cycle called the Saros cycle to determine the year length. However, the position that there was an early information exchange between Greeks and Chaldeans are weak inferences; possibly, there had been a stronger information exchange between the two after Alexander the Great established his empire over Persia in the latter part of the 4th century BCE. Influence on Hipparchus and Ptolemy In 1900, Franz Xaver Kugler demonstrated that Ptolemy had stated in his Almagest IV.2 that Hipparchus improved the values for the Moon's periods known to him from \\"even more ancient astronomers\\" by comparing eclipse observations made earlier by \\"the Chaldeans\\", and by himself. However Kugler found that the periods that Ptolemy attributes to Hipparchus had already been used in Babylonian ephemerides, specifically the collection of texts nowadays called \\"System B\\" (sometimes attributed to Kidinnu). Apparently Hipparchus only confirmed the validity of the periods he learned from the Chaldeans by his newer observations. Later Greek knowledge of this specific Babylonian theory is confirmed by 2nd-century papyrus, which contains 32 lines of a single column of calculations for the Moon using this same \\"System B\\", but written in Greek on papyrus rather than in cuneiform on clay tablets.Asger Aaboe, Episodes from the Early History of Astronomy, New York: Springer, 2001), pp. 62-5; Alexander Jones, \\"The Adaptation of Babylonian Methods in Greek Numerical Astronomy,\\" in The Scientific Enterprise in Antiquity and the Middle Ages, p. 99 It is clear that Hipparchus (and Ptolemy after him) had an essentially complete list of eclipse observations covering many centuries. Most likely these had been compiled from the \\"diary\\" tablets: these are clay tablets recording all relevant observations that the Chaldeans routinely made. Preserved examples date from 652 BCE to CE 130, but probably the records went back as far as the reign of the Babylonian king Nabonassar: Ptolemy starts his chronology with the first day in the Egyptian calendar of the first year of Nabonassar; i.e., 26 February 747 BCE. This raw material by itself must have been tough to use, and no doubt the Chaldeans themselves compiled extracts of e.g., all observed eclipses (some tablets with a list of all eclipses in a period of time covering a saros have been found). This allowed them to recognise periodic recurrences of events. Among others they used in System B (cf. Almagest IV.2): *223 (synodic) months = 239 returns in anomaly (anomalistic month) = 242 returns in latitude (draconic month). This is now known as the saros period which is very useful for predicting eclipses. *251 (synodic) months = 269 returns in anomaly *5458 (synodic) months = 5923 returns in latitude *1 synodic month = 29;31:50:08:20 days (sexagesimal; 29.53059413 ... days in decimals = 29 days 12 hours 44 min 3‚Öì s) or 29.53 days The Babylonians expressed all periods in synodic months, probably because they used a lunisolar calendar. Various relations with yearly phenomena led to different values for the length of the year. Similarly various relations between the periods of the planets were known. The relations that Ptolemy attributes to Hipparchus in Almagest IX.3 had all already been used in predictions found on Babylonian clay tablets. Other traces of Babylonian practice in Hipparchus' work are *first Greek known to divide the circle in 360 degrees of 60 arc minutes. *first consistent use of the sexagesimal number system. *the use of the unit pechus (\\"cubit\\") of about 2¬∞ or 2¬Ω¬∞. *use of a short period of 248 days = 9 anomalistic months. Means of transmission All this knowledge was transferred to the Greeks probably shortly after the conquest by Alexander the Great (331 BCE). According to the late classical philosopher Simplicius (early 6th century), Alexander ordered the translation of the historical astronomical records under supervision of his chronicler Callisthenes of Olynthus, who sent it to his uncle Aristotle. It is worth mentioning here that although Simplicius is a very late source, his account may be reliable. He spent some time in exile at the Sassanid (Persian) court, and may have accessed sources otherwise lost in the West. It is striking that he mentions the title t√®resis (Greek: guard) which is an odd name for a historical work, but is in fact an adequate translation of the Babylonian title massartu meaning \\"guarding\\" but also \\"observing\\". Anyway, Aristotle's pupil Callippus of Cyzicus introduced his 76-year cycle, which improved upon the 19-year Metonic cycle, about that time. He had the first year of his first cycle start at the summer solstice of 28 June 330 BCE (Julian proleptic date), but later he seems to have counted lunar months from the first month after Alexander's decisive battle at Gaugamela in fall 331 BCE. So Callippus may have obtained his data from Babylonian sources and his calendar may have been anticipated by Kidinnu. Also it is known that the Babylonian priest known as Berossus wrote around 281 BCE a book in Greek on the (rather mythological) history of Babylonia, the Babyloniaca, for the new ruler Antiochus I; it is said that later he founded a school of astrology on the Greek island of Kos. Another candidate for teaching the Greeks about Babylonian astronomy/astrology was Sudines who was at the court of Attalus I Soter late in the 3rd century BC. Historians have also found evidence that Athens during the late 5th century may have been aware of Babylonian astronomy. astronomers, or astronomical concepts and practices through the documentation by Xenophon of Socrates telling his students to study astronomy to the extent of being able to tell the time of night from the stars. This skill is referenced in the poem of Aratos, which discusses telling the time of night from the zodiacal signs. In any case, the translation of the astronomical records required profound knowledge of the cuneiform script, the language, and the procedures, so it seems likely that it was done by some unidentified Chaldeans. Now, the Babylonians dated their observations in their lunisolar calendar, in which months and years have varying lengths (29 or 30 days; 12 or 13 months respectively). At the time they did not use a regular calendar (such as based on the Metonic cycle like they did later), but started a new month based on observations of the New Moon. This made it very tedious to compute the time interval between events. What Hipparchus may have done is transform these records to the Egyptian calendar, which uses a fixed year of always 365 days (consisting of 12 months of 30 days and 5 extra days): this makes computing time intervals much easier. Ptolemy dated all observations in this calendar. He also writes that \\"All that he (=Hipparchus) did was to make a compilation of the planetary observations arranged in a more useful way\\" (Almagest IX.2). Pliny states (Naturalis Historia II.IX(53)) on eclipse predictions: \\"After their time (=Thales) the courses of both stars (=Sun and Moon) for 600 years were prophesied by Hipparchus,...\\" This seems to imply that Hipparchus predicted eclipses for a period of 600 years, but considering the enormous amount of computation required, this is very unlikely. Rather, Hipparchus would have made a list of all eclipses from Nabonasser's time to his own.

(retrieved January 25, 2009 Much of Khalidi's scholarly work in the 1990s focused on the historical construction of nationalism in the Arab world. Drawing on the work of theorist Benedict Anderson who described nations as \\"imagined communities\\", he does not posit primordial national identities, but argues that these nations have legitimacy and rights. In Palestinian Identity: The Construction of Modern National Consciousness (1997), he places the emergence of Palestinian national identity in the context of Ottoman and British colonialism as well as the early Zionist effort in the Levant. Palestinian Identity won the Middle East Studies Association's top honor, the Albert Hourani Book Award as best book of 1997.Albert Hourani Book Award Recipients, 1991-2005 His dating of the emergence of Palestinian nationalism to the early 20th century and his tracing of its contours provide a rejoinder to Israeli nationalist claims that Palestinians had no collective claims prior to the 1948 creation of Israel. His signature work, Palestinian Identity: The Construction of Modern National Consciousness (Columbia University Press, 1997), argues that Arabs living in Palestine began to regard themselves as a distinct people decades before 1948, \\"and that the struggle against Zionism does not by itself sufficiently explain Palestinian nationalism\\".or http://lists.econ.utah.edu/pipermail/marxism/2009-March/045483.html Chronicle of Higher Education \\"Rashid Khalidi's Balancing Act: The Middle-East scholar courts controversy with his Palestinian advocacy\\" by Evan R.

In Resurrecting Empire: Western Footprints and America's Perilous Path in the Middle East (2004), Khalidi takes readers on a historical tour of Western involvement in the Middle East, and argues that these interactions continue to have a colonialist nature that is both morally unacceptable and likely to backfire. Khalidi's book, Sowing Crisis, places the United States approach to the Middle East in historical context. He is sharply critical of U.S. policies during the Cold War, writing that Cold War policies \\"formulated to oppose the Soviets, consistently undermined democracy and exacerbated tensions in the Middle East\\". and Chronicle of Higher Education \\"Rashid Khalidi's Balancing Act: The Middle-East scholar courts controversy with his Palestinian advocacy\\" by Evan R.

He adds, \\"The Cold War was over, but its tragic sequels, its toxic debris, and its unexploded mines continued to cause great harm, in ways largely unrecognized in American discourse.\\"Khalidi, Rashid.

In Palestinian Identity, Khalidi demonstrates that a Palestinian national consciousness had it origins near the beginning of the twentieth century. Khalidi describes the Arab population of British Mandatory Palestine as having \\"overlapping identities\\", with some or many expressing loyalties to villages, regions, a projected nation of Palestine, an alternative of inclusion in a Greater Syria, an Arab national project, as well as to Islam.The Great Syrian Revolt and the Rise of Arab Nationalism, Michael Provence, University of Texas Press, 2005, p. 158 Nevertheless, Palestinian Identity was the first to demonstrate substantive Palestinian nationalism in the early Mandatory period. Khalidi writes, \\"Local patriotism could not yet be described as nation-state nationalism.\\"Khalidi, Palestinian Identity. p. 32 Khalidi emphasized in his work that the Palestinian identity had been fundamentally fluid and changing, woven from multiple \\"narratives\\" due to individual and family experiences. He described the identity as organically developed due to the challenges of peasants forced from their homes due to Zionist immigrant pressure, but with Palestinian nationalism also being far more complex than merely an anti-Zionist reaction. Praise for his book appeared in the journal Foreign Affairs, with reviewer William B. Quandt viewing the work as \\"a major contribution to historical understanding of Palestinian nationalism.\\" Khalidi also documents active opposition by the Arab press to Zionism in the 1880s.Army of Shadows, Palestinian Collaboration with Zionism, 1917‚Äì1948, Hillel Cohen University of California Press, 2008, p. 275, n.2 Response to The Iron Cage Praise In a review of Khalidi's The Iron Cage: The Story of the Palestinian Struggle for Statehood, for Middle East Policy, Philip Wilcox praised \\"Khalidi's brilliant inquiry into why Palestinians have failed to win a state of their own\\" calling the book \\"a welcome antidote to the propaganda and mythology that still dominate American discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\\" Writing in The Guardian, Ian Black said the book \\"brilliantly analyses the structural handicap which hobbled the Palestinians throughout 30 years of British rule\\". In a review for Salon, Jonathan Shainin wrote that \\"The Iron Cage is a patient and eloquent work, ranging over the whole of modern Palestinian history from World War I to the death of Yasser Arafat.\\" In Foreign Affairs, L. Carl Brown wrote that \\"Khalidi's book is no exercise in victimology. He is tough on the British, the Israelis, and the Americans, but he is scarcely less hard-hitting in appraising the Palestinians\\". He went on to praise the final chapter's \\"excellent critique\\" of the development of the PLO's positions towards Israel and the Two-state solution. Criticism New York Times columnist Clyde Haberman said of Khalidi's book The Iron Cage: The Story of the Palestinian Struggle for Statehood: \\"But he makes this more than an exercise in self-pity by refusing to let the Palestinians themselves off the hook. If they indeed live in an iron cage, well, Khalidi says, they helped mold the bars themselves\\" and asks \\"When he talks about repressive Israeli measures having been 'sometimes imposed on the pretext of security,' critics are bound to ask: What pretext? How many suicide bombings of cafes and pizza shops does it take before a country has a right to end them by any method that seems to work?\\" Efraim Karsh said about the same book \\"One would have hoped that after 80 years of stubborn adherence to the 'one-state solution' and an equally adamant rejection of the 'two-state solution,' which have resulted in Palestinian statelessness, all but the most fanatically self-deluded would grasp the root causes of the Palestinian debacle ‚Äì not least a historian purporting to redress the 'continuing refusal to look honestly at what has happened in this small land over the past century or so.'\\" Public life Khalidi has written dozens of scholarly articles on Middle East history and politics, as well as op-ed pieces in many U.S. newspapers. He has also been a guest on radio and TV shows including All Things Considered, Talk of the Nation, Morning Edition, Worldview, The News Hour with Jim Lehrer, Charlie Rose, and Nightline, and has appeared on the BBC, the CBC, France Inter and the Voice of America. He served as president of the American Committee on Jerusalem, now known as the American Task Force on Palestine, and advised the Palestinian delegation at the Madrid Conference of 1991. Views on Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict Khalidi has written that the establishment of the state of Israel resulted in \\"the uprooting of the world's oldest and most secure Jewish communities, which had found in the Arab lands a tolerance that, albeit imperfect, was nonexistent in the often genocidal, Jew-hating Christian West.\\" Regarding the proposed two- state solution to the Israel‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, Khalidi has written that \\"the now universally applauded two-state solution faces the juggernaut of Israel's actions in the occupied territories over more than forty years, actions that have been expressly designed to make its realization in any meaningful form impossible.\\" However, Khalidi also noted that \\"there are also flaws in the alternatives, grouped under the rubric of the one-state solution\\".Palestine: Liberation Deferred by Rashid Khalidi, The Nation, May 8, 2008 (retrieved October 21, 2008 He supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. Regarding American support for Israel, Khalidi stated in an interview, \\"every other single place on the face of the earth is in support of the Palestinians, yet all of them together aren't a hill of beans compared to the United States and Israel, because the United States and Israel can basically do anything they please. They are the world superpower, they are the regional superpower.\\", Interview with Rashid Khalidi, North Coast Xpress, Spring 2001. Retrieved on October 21, 2008. Archived from the original A New York Sun editorial criticized Khalidi for stating that there is a legal right under international law for Palestinians to resist Israeli occupation. For example, in a speech given to the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, Khalidi said, \\"[k]illing civilians is a war crime. It's a violation of international law. They are not soldiers. They're civilians, they're unarmed. The ones who are armed, the ones who are soldiers, the ones who are in occupation, that's different. That's resistance.\\"Note: The ADC transcript of Khalidi's speech has been edited, and has sections missing. Thus, it cannot be used for verification. The Sun editorial argued that by failing to distinguish between Palestinian combatants and noncombatants, Khalidi implies that all Palestinians have this right to resist, which it claimed was incorrect under international law. In an interview discussing this editorial, Khalidi objected to this characterization as incorrect and taken out of the context of his statements on international law. Khalidi has described discussions of Arab restitution for property confiscated from the Jewish refugees from Middle Eastern and North African countries after the creation of Israel as \\"insidious\\", \\"because the advocates of Jewish refugees are not working to get those legitimate assets back but are in fact trying to cancel out the debt of Israel toward Palestinian refugees\\".  NYC teacher training program  In 2005 Khalidi's participation in a New York City teacher training program was ended by the city's Schools Chancellor. Chancellor Joel I. Klein issued a statement that \\"Considering his past statements, Rashid Khalidi should not have been included in a program that provided professional development for [Department of Education] teachers and he won't be participating in the future.\\" Following the decision, Columbia University president Lee Bollinger spoke out on Khalidi's behalf, writing: \\"The department's decision to dismiss Professor Khalidi from the program was wrong and violates First Amendment principles... The decision was based solely on his purported political views and was made without any consultation and apparently without any review of the facts.\\" 2008 U.S. presidential campaign Consequent to publication by the Los Angeles Times of an article about Obama's attendance at a 2003 farewell dinner for Khalidi, their relationship became an issue in the campaign. Some opponents of Barack Obama claimed that the relationship between Obama and Khalidi was evidence that Obama would not maintain a pro-Israel foreign policy if elected. When asked, Obama called his own commitment to Israel \\"unshakeable\\" and said he does not consult with Khalidi on foreign policy.Obama on the Defensive Before Fla.

It is named after James Hector. It is a widespread marine fish, known from shallow tropical waters in the south-eastern Atlantic, from the western Pacific off Australia and New Zealand, and from the eastern Pacific off Chile. It is one of the few species of lanternfishes to inhabit shallow waters, and in those waters it is one of the most abundant species of fish, and central to the food chain of the upper continental slope. The abundance is due to its high fecundity ‚Äî it spawns multiple times in the winter so that the fry can take advantage of the spring bloom of krill. It grows up to standard length (SL) and may reach the age of 3 years. It reaches sexual maturity at approximately 50 mm SL and age of one year. Hector's lanternfish is fished commercially using seine nets in the waters off South Africa, where catches have reached 42,400 tonnes. The catch is ground up to make fish meal and fish oil.

It was released in Japan on June 30, 2005, and in North America on June 5, 2006, in Australia on July 5, 2006, and in Europe on July 7, 2006. The game was planned to be released in China for the iQue DS system, and appeared in the system's trailer, but this release was cancelled for unknown reasons. It has been compared to Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!. It is marketed under Nintendo's Touch! Generations brand. A sequel, Big Brain Academy: Wii Degree, was released on the Wii in April 2007. Gameplay In Big Brain Academy, tests are done in order to measure the player's brain's mass. The heavier the brain, the smarter the brain is or the better its reaction time. There is no single game mechanism to Big Brain Academy; as it is an assortment of puzzles with no one puzzle having greater priority than the other. There are three modes of play: Test mode, Practice mode, and Versus mode. Test mode Test mode consists of a formal test containing five puzzles, with one puzzle taken at random from each of the five categories to determine the player's brain mass. After the test, the player is given a letter grade. Dr. Lobe (the \\"headmaster\\" of Big Brain Academy) also assesses what areas the player needs to improve in and what ranking they would be. Professions include museum curator, librarian, astronaut, investor, fashion stylist, diplomat, cave man, Isaac Newton, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, politician, poet, banker, doctor, musician, etc. There are five different categories of tests with three activities per category. The categories are (followed by their activities): *Think (Logic- themed questions) *Analyze (Reason-based questions) *Compute (Math-themed questions) *Identify (Visual-themed questions) *Memorize (Memory-based questions) Practice mode Practice mode allows the player to select which specific activity he or she wants to do in order to train their brain. The activities available for play are the same as those available in Test mode. Each activity has three levels of difficulty, and the player can earn either a bronze, silver, gold, or platinum medal for achieving a certain brain mass on each difficulty level. A mass of 50 grams is required for a bronze medal, 150 grams for silver, and 250 for gold. The mass required for a platinum medal differs for each difficulty level of each activity, however the exact mass required for each platinum medal is not specified in the game. Versus mode In Versus mode, players can compete to determine who has the heaviest brain. Anywhere from 1 to 7 players can join a hosting player, whether or not they themselves have a copy of the game. Reception As of March 31, 2008, Big Brain Academy had sold 5.01 million copies worldwide. It received a \\"Double Platinum\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 600,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

This design is (though rare) highly prized among bass players usually in hard rock and heavy metal music. Some electric guitars have also sported the axe design though they are moderately popular and sometimes discredited. Since its creation, the axe bass has been highly desired, very expensive, and a very rare prize among guitar shops and music stores. The axe bass has also been associated with Marceline the Vampire Queen (character on the hit Cartoon Network television show Adventure Time), whose bass is very literally made out of a battle axe.  Origin  Rock musician Gene Simmons is to be credited with the \\"axe\\" design. In 1978, Gene was searching for a new bass guitar that would either \\"blend in\\" or \\"stand out from\\" his garish make up and costume, would be a good trademark, and would show his philosophy of how a bass should be handled - like a weapon. After garnering enough wealth from touring with his band KISS, Gene went to renowned luthier Steve Carr to build the first prototype of the axe bass and then the popular bass itself. Since then, the axe bass has been a running trademark for KISS. In 2012, Gene Simmons commissioned Jim Cara of Original Cara Hot Rod Guitars to develop a chrome and gold plating process for the AXE and Punisher project. As of 2013, the Chrome models are available for purchase by high-end Kiss collectors.

Listed at 5' 3\\", 120 lb., Panos batted left- handed and threw left-handed. Sometimes she is credited as Vicky Pano. Career A native of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Canada to Greek-Canadian parents, Panos is one of three descendants of Greek migrants to play in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, being the others Annastasia Batikis and Kay Lionikas. Panos entered the AAGPBL in with the South Bend Blue Sox, playing for them in part of the season before joining the eventual league champion Milwaukee Chicks. She excelled as one of the team's top offensive stars, ranking near the top in several offensive categories. In her only season, Panos scored 84 runs with 141 stolen bases in 115 games, both second- most in the league behind the speedy Sophie Kurys, who scored 87 times and set a league-record with 166 steals. Panos also hit a .263 batting average for sixth place and batted 106 hits for the fifth, while posting a solid .367 on- base percentage and a .978 fielding average. In the postseason, Panos hit .214 with five runs and seven stolen bases for the Chicks, who went on to win the AAGPBL title after beating the Kenosha Comets. Milestone *The AAGPBL folded in 1954, but there is now a permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York since November 5, that honors those who were part of this unique experience. But like many of her AAGPBL colleagues, Vickie Panos was relatively unknown until the 1992 film A League of Their Own by filmmaker Penny Marshall was exhibited for the first time.

It is a superacid and one of the onium ions, indeed the simplest carbonium ion. Methanium can be produced in the laboratory as a rarefied gas or as a dilute species in superacids. It was prepared for the first time in 1950 and published in 1952 by Victor Talrose and his assistant Anna Konstantinovna Lyubimova. It occurs as an intermediate species in chemical reactions. The methanium ion is named after methane (), by analogy with the derivation of ammonium ion () from ammonia (). Structure Methanium can be visualised as a carbenium ion with a molecule of hydrogen interacting with the empty orbital in a 3-center-2-electron bond. The bonding electron pair in the H2 molecule is shared between the two hydrogen and one carbon atoms making up the 3-center-2-electron bond. The two hydrogen atoms in the H2 molecule can continuously exchange positions with the three hydrogen atoms in the ion (a conformation change called pseudorotation, specifically the Berry mechanism). The methanium ion is therefore considered a fluxional molecule. The energy barrier for the exchange is quite low and occurs even at very low temperatures. Infrared spectroscopy has been used to obtain information about the different conformations of the methanium ion. The IR spectrum of plain methane has two C-H bands from symmetric and asymmetric stretching at around 3000 cm‚àí1 and two bands around 1400 cm‚àí1 from symmetrical and asymmetric bending vibrations. In the spectrum of three asymmetric stretching vibrations are present around 2800‚Äì3000 cm‚àí1, a rocking vibration at 1300 cm‚àí1, and a bending vibration at 1100 1300 cm‚àí1. Preparation Methanium can be prepared from methane by the action of very strong acids, such as fluoroantimonic acid (antimony pentafluoride in hydrogen fluoride HF). At about 270 Pa of pressure and ambient temperature, the methane ion will react with neutral methane to yield methanium and a methyl radical: : + ‚Üí + Stability and reactions The cations obtained by reaction of methane with + HF are stabilized by interactions with the HF molecules. At low pressures (around 1 mmHg) and ambient temperatures, methanium is unreactive towards neutral methane. References V. L. Talrose and A. K. Lyubimova, Dokl. Akad.

Plantation location Burgesstown extended to the west as far as the Ochlockonee River, to the east it would cross what is now Meridian Road and border the southern edge of Lake Iamonia. The boundaries would continue east and include the development of Luna Pines and the northern reaches of the development of Killearn Lakes Plantation and would protrude south into the development of Golden Eagle Plantation and Golden Eagle Country Club. The smaller southern section of the plantation bordering Lake Jackson encompasses what is now the western edge of Phipps-Overstreet Park, the western part of Miller Landing Rd. and E.

History and programs SOS was co-founded in 1984 by Ginny Mancini, widow of Academy Award-winning composer Henry Mancini, and Gilda Maiken Anderson and Donna (Fowler) Manners of the vocal group The Skylarks. Their aim was to help singers in need, as there is no union or guild that exclusively represents the rights of singers. It was the mission of SOS to benefit the health and welfare of professional singers by providing emergency assistance and other human services to those in acute financial need. Additionally, the SOS Vocal Arts Scholarship Program helped deserving students take their first step toward becoming professionals in the vocal arts. Tuition-based scholarships were granted to those pursuing master's degrees in Voice. The SOS ceased active functioning in 2017. Funding SOS was primarily funded by individual and corporate donations. SOS supporters included Barbra Streisand, Florence Henderson, Pat Boone, Elton John, and Barry Manilow. As a 501 (c)3 organization it was supported by tax-deductible contributions which helped SOS maintain its free and confidential programs.

It is a member of the National Association of Episcopal Schools (NAES), the National Association for the Education of Young Children, the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS), the Western States Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and the California Association of Independent Schools (CAIS). History St. Margaret's was founded in 1979 by the Reverend Canon Ernest Sillers. The school began with only 79 students in kindergarten through grade six. It was named in honor of the 11th-century Queen Margaret of Scotland, the patron saint of education. The significance of this name is reflected in many St. Margaret's traditions, such as the use of bagpipes in formal ceremonies, along with their athletic team nickname, the Tartans. St. Margaret's opened an Early Childhood Development Center in 1981 and its high school in 1982. By 1985, students were enrolled in grade levels preschool through 12. In 1986, St. Margaret's brought in Markham B. Campaigne as its second headmaster. During his 17-year tenure, St. Margaret's grew to serve over 1,200 students and expanded to a campus. It is now included in Princeton Review's top 444 private schools in the United States book. In 2004, Marcus Hurlbut became the new Headmaster of SMES. In 2013, William Moseley became headmaster. Academics St. Margaret's offers courses in core subjects, as well as other subjects through electives. Theater, art, music and other subjects are available to be taken in addition to the main subject. There are 26 Advanced Placement courses offered in history, math, science, art, language, theatre, music and other subjects. In addition to Advanced Placement (AP) courses, St. Margeret's offers honors courses throughout their various subjects. The variety of courses gives students the opportunity to excel to the best of their ability. Athletics St. Margaret's sports teams are called the Tartans, and they compete as members of the Academy League in the CIF Southern Section. In 2006, the Tartan football team finished 14-0 and won the CIF-SS Northeast Division championship. and in 2008 the Girls' Varsity Tennis Team were the Academy League and CIF Champions, defeating league rival Sage Hill in the finals to finish off a 23-0 winning streak. The 2010-2011 Athletics year was one of the most successful, with 4 CIF Championships in Boys Cross Country, Girls Volleyball, Girls Tennis, and Girls Soccer teams. Additionally, the Boys Cross Country team won the CIF Division 5 State Championship in 2010, 2011, and 2018. St. Margaret's Athletic Program has also been recognized as one of the Top 5 out of all Divisions in Orange County. The varsity girl's soccer program won 4 CIF championships in 2006, 2011, 2012, and 2014. The St. Margaret's football team won the Southern California small-school division championship in the 2014-2015 season. The 6th to 12th grade sports consist of equestrian, golf, basketball, volleyball, soccer, cheer, dance, lacrosse, general PE, and much more. Some sports are separated by gender like volleyball or basketball, but some sports are co-ed such as soccer or dance. Campus In 2007, St. Margaret's completed construction on the DeYoung Family Math and Science Center. In 2011, St. Margaret's constructed a performing arts center, which includes the Hurlbut Theater and houses the music, dance, and theatre departments. A new middle school was constructed in 2015. St. Margaret's has 2 gyms: the Campaigne Center, used by lower schoolers, and the Pasternack Field House, used by middle and upper schoolers. The Pasternack Field House was completed in 2007. There is a middle school field and a main football field, used by members of the high school. The campus covers 22 acres.

One version was developed by Black Box Games and released on the Xbox, PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube; the other was developed by Exient Entertainment and released on the Game Boy Advance. It is the second game of the NHL Hitz series. The Game Boy Advance version has the possibility of being linked with up to three other systems for four player link up play. Gameplay Players have the option of playing three periods in one, two, or three minutes in length. To begin the game, a center, a winger, a defenceman, and a goalie are picked for each team. Prior to each period, substituting the players or simply leaving them in the game is an option. There is an option for a mercy rule that will end the game as soon as the team reaches the limit of goal differential. As an example, if the mercy rule is set to five, as soon as a team leads the game by five goals, that team automatically wins. It can also be set to one goal, similar to overtime. Another nuance to the game is the option to make players who lose fights leave the game. The game is also meant to mainly be a hard-hitting, arcade-style game with wildly exaggerated player movements and actions. For example, players can check other players through the glass and into the stands, but won't stop play. Also, goalies can actually stick-handle the puck around, and take a shot on the other net, sometimes scoring. Also, the rosters are shortened to mainly starters and fan favorites (such as Tie Domi and Bob Probert), with far fewer free agents. There are also many mini-games to play. Franchise mode The tournament is to complete goals in the game to get experience points, which are like stat points. When players win more, they get better equipment, like sticks for accuracy and power, goalie pads for better rebound control, and more. They create a team with the goal of joining the NHL, and they start off picking the team, logo, etc., and then create seven players. As the player progresses, beating teams will result in the teams getting harder, but at the same time their team will improve too. When they start winning games, three more players will eventually ask to join the team, and the player can customize them. There are eight rounds with 5-6 teams in each one around the globe. In the last few rounds, the player will face NHL teams and players and be awarded with the trophy if they emerge victorious. They are faced with a worldwide quest, taking on teams internationally in places such as Brooklyn, Maui, Monte Carlo, Stockholm, and Montego Bay. Season A season mode is available. If the player-controlled team qualifies for them, a full playoff schedule will begin. This time, however, there are more individual awards made by the creators.

The format is now satellite programming along with some syndicated shows. The station is licensed to Blairstown, New Jersey and serves Sussex County and Warren County in western New Jersey, and Monroe County in eastern Pennsylvania. iHeartMedia, Inc. is the station's owner and licensee. The station's transmitter is located near Blairstown, while their studios and offices are currently co-located with currently co-owned WNNJ and WSUS in a state-of-the-art facility at 45 Ed Mitchell Avenue in Franklin, New Jersey. History The station signed on in October 1973 with an Oldies format and the WFMV call letters, broadcasting from studios in the former DL&W; Blairstown railroad station. Studios in 1988, in a former railway station. Warren Broadcasting Corporation and WCRV 1580 in Washington, New Jersey co- owned WFMV. From October 1973 to Early 1977. The station tagline was \\"Golden FMV,\\" and featured DJs Sy Marsh, Chucky B, Wayne Scott, Scott O'Connor, Tommy John, Rod Baumann, Dave Garey, Tony Dee, Geoffrey Kevin Doll and others. WFMV also used the moniker \\"Tri-State Goldmine,\\" since its signal banged into a sliver of New York State, although the Warren County/Poconos NJ-PA region was the station's primary target. The music followed a 50's, 60's, 70's, and \\"Future Gold\\" (borrowed from WCBS-FM) 4-category rotation, with everything played in real-time on turntables except for the Future Gold/Currents, which were on cart. FMV had a generous list of Future Gold songs, jumping on records such as \\"Emma\\" by Hot Chocolate, \\"L-O-V-E\\" by Al Green, John Lennon's \\"#9 Dream,\\" Chaka Khan's \\"Once You Get Started,\\" Ben E. King's \\"Supernatural Thing,\\" Sammy Johns' \\"Chevy Van,\\" Sugarloaf's \\"Don't Call Us, We'll Call You\\" and War's \\"Low Rider.\\" Even if listeners weren't into the oldies, which weren't that old then, Golden FMV's current song category rivaled the playlists of any New York, Philly, or Allentown top forty station at the time. WFMV became very promotions-oriented during this period, tying in with venues such as The Still in Tranquility for contests like \\"Kissable Lips,\\" in which female listeners were invited to send in a lipstick imprint of their lips for a chance to win a blind date with an 'FMV disc jockey, dinner and drinks included. The station was unique among suburban/smaller market stations for being extremely personality-driven, with GM Chuck Bettyeman, to his credit, holding regular staff meetings at which the disc jockeys ‚Äì mostly on their first or second jobs in radio ‚Äì were encouraged to have fun on the air, add humor, and be themselves. As Chucky put it, \\"You can be as good as anyone on WABC if you want to.\\" In January 1977, Kurt Gebauer was hired as VP/General Manager and the station became \\"FM 106\\", retaining the oldies format, but updating to a more 1960s-centric sound. The DJs at the time were: Mark Austin, Steve Altemus, Tommy John, George Fuller, Rod Baumann, Ron Kaplan, Bill Chamberlain, Patty Martene and others. In 1980, with Russ Long as GM, the station switched to a Top 40/Rock hybrid format much deeper than the format on the frequency today. WFMV was sold to Clearview Broadcasting in 1981. In 1984, after Russ Long left for WVPO and WSBG, under a new GM Bill Dimmick, WFMV evolved into more of a Hot Adult Contemporary format. Ratings were always mediocre to below average. At the time advertising tended to be from the Stroudsburg and Pocono area. With Stroudsburg-based WSBG switching to a similar format in 1984, WFMV lost more advertising but survived. In 1986, Barbara Perry took over as GM. In the summer of 1988 due to environmental issues and the drought the station was forced to leave the air from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily for several summer months. Eventually, that problem was resolved. By then, the station format was mostly gold-based adult contemporary. On-air staff members included Rockin' T Tom Rocco, Allen Garrett, Paul Maason, Kevin Roe, Doctor J, Corey Hansen, Chris Maget, Mark West, Gerrie Burke, Paul LaFever, Chris DeBello, Jo-Ann (Holden) George and Sean O'Casey, and Bill Reilly (Sunday mornings). In the spring of 1990 WFMV dropped this format and returned to oldies, with hits primarily from 1964 to 1984, and occasionally stretching the year range. The tagline was \\"Classic Hits 106.\\" In the fall of 1990 the station changed the range to music from 1955 to about 1983. Sue Lafever took over as GM in 1991. Ratings were very low and the station began to lose money. In the fall of 1992 the owners hired a new general manager, Rick Musselman who decided several weeks later to fill a hole in the market. Since May 1988, Sussex and Warren counties had no country music station but could get New York City-based WYNY 97.1. Later that year WYNY moved its frequencies to 103.5, which could not be heard in WFMV's listening area due to 103.7 WNNJ-FM's broadcasting on nearly the same frequency (103.7). Country music fans were without any way to receive country music in the area until 1990 when WRWD in the Hudson Valley signed on. Still reception for that station was good in Sussex County but poor in Warren County. Saturday, October 24, at 8 p.m., WFMV Classic Hits 106 ended with 99 Luftballons by Nena. American Country Countdown came on next, which WFMV had already been running since 1991 at 8:00 PM Sundays. At midnight the station became \\"WHCY Hot Country 106.3\\". WHCY stood for Hot Country which are still the call letters today. The country format immediately made FM 106.3 profitable and the station received mediocre to above average ratings over the years. The station had live morning and afternoon drives during the week and middays on Saturdays and Sundays. The rest of the time they ran Jones Satellite Country music programming. In the spring of 1994 they dropped satellite programming for a live local presentation. Airstaff included Bob O., Rich Wilson, Jo-Ann Holden, Christa Robinson, Doctor J, Tony Lawrence, Matt Black, Tom Rocco, Biii E Dow, Doug Hall, Dave The Rave, Johnny Randolph, and others. Paul LeFevre continued to do voiceovers. In March 1996 the station was sold to Nassau Broadcasting. A few people, including Bob O, exited, but most of the staff stayed on and the Country format continued. More on-air changes were made in 1997 with the addition of Rod Bauman as middays and program director. Matt Black, Doctor J, and Tony Lawrence would exit at this point. Chris Debello and Simon Knight would also arrive on staff. Ratings always had huge rises and falls over the years on this station. While ratings were always decent there was concern about the long term viability of the country format. There were two other stations competing locally. A station with an automated country format, 107.1 FM (WRNJ-FM), signed on short;y after WHCY adopted the Hot Country format in 1992. WRNJ had low ratings, but still this was taking from WHCY. Then, in the summer of 1997, WLEV on 96.1 FM in the nearby Lehigh Valley, became known as Cat Country with the WCTO calls. WLEV's calls moved to the other Adult Contemporary station in that market on 100.7 FM. An FM country station in the Lehigh Valley was speculated to adversely affect WHCY. Nassau toyed with the ideas of a rock format or all news format in the fall of 1997. At the end of the year, WHCY opted to keep the country format, but using more syndication and automation to cut costs. In 1998 the station became automated part-time and live part-time with satellite programming in the evenings. The station would later that year replace Rich Wilson with former WYNY airstaff member Frank Bruno for mornings along with longtime air staff member Jo-Ann George, and the format continued for a couple more years with moderate success. On August 25, 2000, Nassau switched to a straight Contemporary Hit Radio format. The Hot Country airstaff was spread to other Nassau radio stations while the new airstaff moved to WHCY from several other Nassau stations. The station tagline was \\"Max 106.3, Today's Hit Music.\\" The It featured Chaz and Kara in the Morning. Jo-Ann George returned in the fall of 2001, replacing Kara. The station was automated on overnights only initially. Other staffers included Matt Sneed, Mark Myles, Trish Davis, Jason Barsky (initially program director), Kyle D., and Kenny Hoyt of Channel X and others. Programming was a blend of Rock, Adult Contemporary Crossovers, Dance music, R & B, and a limited amount of Rap. Ratings became slightly more consistent. Nassau then sold the station along with 3 other stations and 2 local marketing agreement deals to Clear Channel in exchange for cash plus WODE-FM and WEEX in the Lehigh Valley in the winter of 2001.http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/10851/#axzz2aLje4ykn Matt Sneed would stay with Nassau and go to WPST. Jason Barsky stayed with Clear Channel as PD and eventually Mornings in Harrisburg, PA and is currently at KDND in Sacramento, CA doing Mornings with the same team. Under Clear Channel, the station changed only slightly initially. In 2002 the station began to lean younger and play more Rap and R & B product. At that point the airstaff gradually changed and the station gradually began automating more timeslots during the day. \\"Borasio\\" moved into the afternoon slot and Mark Myles exited. Kyle continued with the station at night assisting \\"Borasio\\" with the station (leaving in 2004 to head to WBHT.) In January 2003, they began simulcasting Z100's Elvis Duran and the Morning Zoo and made a few more airstaff changes. Until the summer of 2004 Max 106.3 was playing a large amount of rap along with a lot of alternative rock and R & B material. One of the large contributors to the alternative rock portion of the programming during 2003 was the Channel X program, originally created and hosted by \\"Borasio\\", a host named \\"Uncle Kenny\\" (Hoyt-singer for a local metal band named Crushpile with no known former radio experience) was recruited. This name, however, was used only once and \\"Kenny\\" was the on-air name to be used during the short-lived period of the program (January 2003-September 2003). The original time slot for the program was 10pm to midnight. Due to high demand, the program was extended to 9 pm. Within the 9 months of the program's existence, it peaked at an astounding 37 percent market share (Arbitron 2003). Many attribute the show's success to a combination of Kenny's antics and the musical mix (which ranged from modern-day rock such as Linkin Park to old thrash bands like Anthrax and Slayer). Kenny's approach was far different from the cardboard cut-out standard of today's commercial radio. The entire 3-hour show was done live with no preparation, additional writers or hosts. Although fictitious \\"record label executives\\" had been known to drop by the station for \\"exclusive interviews\\". Bizarre on-air comments, stories, blank-outs, spasms, sound effects and more were not uncommon for the program. Despite the success of this program and others, since 2002 advertising was becoming a tough sell because the format leaned too young. As a result, Max 106.3 dropped all the rap and R & B product, the Channel X program, added more pop rock from the 1990s, and became an Adult CHR format. They use the phrase \\"90s and Now\\". The station was heavily automated as well. On Monday, July 28, 2008, Max 106.3 dropped all local operations in favor of \\"Today's Best Hits\\" from ABC Radio. Friday, December 19, 2008, was the last day Elvis Duran and the Morning Show was aired on WHCY. In 2009, ABC Radio's format was dropped and Clear Channel's Premium Choice CHR format was picked up with Valentine In The Morning. As of October 11, 2010, they are once again broadcasting Elvis Duran and The Morning Show. Clear Channel, the licensee of WHCY, continues to own and manage the station with an LMA and WHCY continues to offer Premium Choice CHR Radio Programming.

In 1527 Concepci√≥n was incorporated into Santo Domingo, which remained the only diocese until 1862. Many regular clergy came with the French into the French territory, especially the Dominicans and the Capuchins. The Dominicans devoted themselves especially to the mission in the western part of the colony, and were for a time supported therein by other orders and secular priests.\\"Text has been adapted from: Reinhold, G. (1910). \\"Haiti\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia, New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved May 27, 2009 \\"The Dominicans were also designated as missionaries to the southern part of the island. The Capuchins, who looked after the northern part of the island, and were likewise assisted by other orders and secular priests, soon were unable to supply enough missionaries. On that account they gave up this mission in 1704, and were replaced by the Jesuits, who worked there until their expulsion at the end of 1763. Secular priests followed, but after five years they were superseded by Capuchins.\\" \\"The Haitian Revolution brought an end to the first wave of evangelisation. Influence by the clergy ceased in the northern part of the country, the western mission improved under the British occupation from 1794 to 1798, while, in the south, the Apostolic prefect P√®re Viriot, was murdered. When the leader of the revolution Toussaint L'Ouverture came to power in 1800, he restored the rights of the Catholic Church. However, the council of Constitutional bishops at Paris had nominated a bishop of Santo Domingo, who never obtained recognition either from Toussaint or the Capuchins. In 1802 General Leclere restored the former jurisdictions of Cap- Ha√Øtien and Port-au-Prince, and named as prefects Apostolic P√®res Corneille Brelle, O. Cap., and Lecun, O. P.. These appointments were confirmed by the Vatican. Tensions increased as poverty spread, mistreatment of slaves was common and a class system grew between a French-speaking Catholic minority and the poorer Creole majority. The Haitian slaves revolted in 1804 and, under the leadership of Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Haiti became the first black independent nation. After a massacre in 1804, nearly all the clergy left the colony. For the following two years the only religious services given at Port- au-Prince were held by a former sacristan. After the overthrow of Jacques I in 1806 some missionaries returned.\\" The Concordat and the second wave of evangelization (1860‚Äì1910) \\"After years of negotiations, a concordat between the Catholic Church and the Haitian government was signed on 28 March 1860. In December 1860, Monseigneur Monetti arrived as the Church's delegate. Pope Pius IX signed the Concordat with Haiti The concordat provided that the Catholic Church would have the special protection of the Government. The president would nominate the archbishop and the bishops, but the Pope could refuse them canonical institution. The clergy received an annual salary of 1200 francs from the State.\\" \\"Five bishoprics were erected in 1861; the Archbishopric of Port-au-Prince, and the Sees of Cap-Haitien, Les Cayes, Gona√Øves, and Port-de- Paix. Initially, the Archbishop of Port-au-Prince administered all the dioceses. A separate bishop was appointed to Cap-haitien in 1873, who would also oversee the administration of Port-au-Paix. In 1893 a separate bishop was appointed for Les Cayes; while Gona√Øves was still administered by the archbishop. On the conclusion of the concordat, three fathers of the Congregation of the Holy Ghost and of the Holy Heart of Mary were sent to Port-au-Prince. These restored the regular parish organization in the capital. The first archbishop, du Cosquer, and his successor, Quilloux, visited France to enlist new priests. Because of diseases in the tropical climate, many of the clergy died. By 1906, out of 516 priests who had come from France since 1864, 200 had died, 150 were still at their posts, and the rest were invalided to Europe. To ensure recruits, Mgr. du Cosquer established the Saint-Martial Seminary in 1864, which was united with the Colonial Seminary conducted by the Fathers of the Holy Ghost. It received an annual state subsidy of 20,000 francs, the payment of which, however, was suspended owing to the political troubles of 1867, and in 1869 it was entirely abrogated. In 1870, owing to the war, the Fathers of the Holy Ghost gave up direction of the seminary. Mgr. Quilloux then founded a new seminary in Pontch√¢teau (Loire inf√©rieure) in 1873 under the direction of the Fathers of the Society of Mary. Finally in 1893 the seminary was removed to St-Jacques (Finisterre) and its direction entrusted to the secular priests. By 1909, Pontch√¢teau Seminary had sent 196 priests to Haiti, and St. Jacques had sent 171, for 92 parishes.\\" The struggle and reconciliation with voodoo culture (1934‚Äì1990) A large sequined Vodou \\"drapo\\" or flag by the artist George Valris, depicting the veve, or symbol, of the loa Loko Atison. After the American Occupation ended in 1934, there was a constant struggle for power between the Catholic Church and the followers of voodoo. The small number of priests and members of religious institutes in the 1930s ministered mainly to the urban elite. Until the mid-20th century, the majority of priests were francophone Europeans, particularly Bretons, who were culturally distant from their rural parishioners. Catholic clergy were generally hostile toward voodoo, and they led two major campaigns against the religion in 1896 and 1941. During these campaigns, the government outlawed voodoo services, and Catholics destroyed voodoo religious objects. Catholic clergy, however, have not been persistently militant in their opposition to voodoo, and they have had relatively little impact on the religious practices of the rural and the urban poor. The clergy have generally directed their energies more toward educating the urban population than toward eradicating voodoo. In the 1970s and the 1980s, the use of Creole and drum music became common in Catholic services. Incorporating folk elements into the liturgy, however, did not mean that the Catholic Church's attitude toward voodoo had changed. In everyday practice, many people incorporate both Catholicism and voodoo together.*McAlister, Elizabeth. 1998. \\"|The Madonna of 115th St. Revisited: Vodou and Haitian Catholicism in the Age of Transnationalism.\\" In S. Warner, ed., Gatherings in Diaspora. Philadelphia: Temple Univ. Press. Nationalists and others came to resent the Catholic Church because of its European orientation and its alliance with the mulatto elite. Fran√ßois Duvalier opposed the church more than any other Haitian president. He expelled the archbishop of Port-au-Prince, the Jesuit order, and numerous priests between 1959 and 1961. In response to these moves, the Vatican excommunicated Duvalier. When relations with the church were restored in 1966, a Haitian archbishop was named for the first time, and the president gained the right to nominate bishops. In the aftermath of Jean-Claude Duvalier's departure, the church took a less active role in Haiti's politics. The church hierarchy strongly supported the suppressed 1987 Constitution, which granted official status to Creole and guaranteed basic human rights, including the right to practice voodoo. The alliance with the lower classes left the Catholic Church with two unresolved problems in the late 1980s: its uneasy relationship with voodoo and its relationship to the more radical elements of the political movement that it had supported.Chapter on Catholicism, Section on Society, Richard A. Haggerty, ed. Haiti: A Country Study. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1989 The fight against poverty and liberation theology (1990‚Äì2004) The mid-1980s marked a profound change in the church's stance on issues related to peasants and the urban poor. Reflecting this change was the statement by Pope John Paul II, during a visit to Haiti in 1983, that \\"Things must change here\\".\\"Things Must Change Here\\", by John Kohan;Sam Allis/Guatemala City and Wilton Wynn with the Pope Monday, TIME Magazine, March 21, 1983 Galvanized by the Vatican's concern, Catholic clergy and lay workers called for improved human rights. Lay workers helped develop a peasant-community movement, especially at a center in the Plateau Central. The Catholic radio station, Radio Soleil, played a key role in disseminating news about government actions during the 1985-86 crisis and encouraging opponents of the Duvalier government. The bishops, particularly in J√©r√©mie and Cap-Ha√Øtien, actively denounced Duvalierist repression and human-rights violations. In 1990, a priest from the slums of Port-au-Prince was elected by 67% of the people: Jean Bertrand Aristide, seen as the first leader of the people since 1804. Though Cardinal Ratzinger did praise the theology's intellectual underpinnings that reject violence, and, instead, \\"[stress] the responsibility which Christians necessarily bear for the poor and oppressed\\",\\"Liberation Theology\\" by Cardinal Ratzinger at Christendom Awake he strongly opposed certain elements of Liberation Theology, through the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and the Vatican twice (1984, 1986) officially condemned its acceptance of Marxism and armed violence. Since then, the Catholic Church in Haiti has adopted a more prayerful, pacifist and human approach in providing help and justice for the poor, as can be shown in the conduct of Father G√©rard Jean-Juste. 21st century Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption after its collapse during the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In 2020, the building is still in ruins. The Church is attempting to assist Haitians who are in poverty, and with their health and living conditions. In accordance with Catholic social teaching, it strives to vindicate the right to life of all people in Haiti, through partnerships and twinnings.A number of projects could be mentioned among which the Haiti Outreach Mission of the Richmond Diocese - Twinning Information According to the Catholic Church in Haiti, the ten dioceses of the two ecclesiastical provinces of Haiti include 251 parishes and about 1500 Christian rural communities. The indigenous clergy has 400 diocesan priests and 300 seminarians. Vocations to the priesthood are considered sufficient. There are also 1300 religious missionary priests belonging to more than 70 religious congregations. Church members and property sustained damage as the result of the 2010 Haitian earthquake. Killed included Port-au-Prince's Archbishop Joseph Serge Miot, his chancellor, many seminarians and religious, and the sister of Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns of Brazil. The Port-au-Prince Cathedral, other churches in Port-au-Prince and neighboring cities, including those of L√©og√¢ne and Petit-Goave; the Notre Dame Grand Seminary; and some archdiocesan offices sustained major damage or destruction. In 2014 the Pope named the first Haitian to become a cardinal of the Church: Chibly Langlois, Bishop of Les Cayes and president of the Haitian Episcopal Conference.

The new semi-pixelated tiger- stripe pattern would trade its dominant blue overtones for a more subdued palette, similar to the Universal Camouflage Pattern, but with some added slate blue tones.About.com US Military, (2004).

The main town within the township is also identified as Saint-Donat-de-Montcalm to distinguish it from a parish municipality with the same name in La Mitis RCM. It is located approximately northwest of Montreal. The town is surrounded by mountains and numerous water basins of the Laurentian Mountains. The nearest natural landmark is the Mont-Tremblant National Park. History Saint-Donat was founded sometime near 1876 by a religious community of suffragettes as the \\"Saint-Donat Parish\\" near the church (located at the intersection of Principale and Allard streets). It was therefore first settled in the mid-to- late 19th century, as a solution to the overcrowding of cities such as Montreal. Over the time, the small village received urban population attracted by its beautiful landscape and the town was officially established in 1904. By 1950, Saint-Donat had reached a population of 2,000. As of 2006, the town was nearing 4,300 permanent residents. Demographics Population Private dwellings occupied by usual residents: 2028 (total dwellings: 4414) Language All official government actions take place in French, the official language of Quebec.

Its main attraction is snowmobiling, but other winter sports, such as skiing, can be enjoyed there as well, with Ski Garceau and Ski La Reserve being the two most popular resorts in the area. Outdoor skating rinks and cross country ski trails through the forest are frequented by locals and tourists alike. Its mountains, lakes, and pleasant weather attract many tourists in the summer season. Many people who vacation in Saint-Donat during the summer enjoy swimming, kayaking, sailing, and water-skiing on its two large lakes, Lac Archambault and (Lac) Lake Ouareau. Saint-Donat is the only village in the Laurentiens that has two side-by-side lakes of the size of Archambault and Ouareau. Saint-Donat also contains many other smaller lakes such as Lac Baribeau, Lac Pembina, Lac Croche, and others. The year-round population of Saint-Donat is approximately 3,700, but during the tourist season, the number of people actually in Saint-Donat can reach 20,000. Saint-Donat has been recognized for its beauty and has received national recognition, especially for the quality of its public places. It was first recognized as a prime tourist destination in 1908, by an engineer with the Ministry of Lands and Forests. Hotels and other businesses necessary in a tourist destination began within a few decades, and tourism was the focal point of the local economy by 1970.

The first inhabitants were prisoners sentenced by minor crimes; 50 years after it was established the population of the parish was little more than ten families. The village was frequently attacked by pirates, and destroyed completely in 1590, resulting in the construction of fortress, around 1602: the Fort of S√£o Clemente (), which was constructed between 1599 and 1602 (during the reign of King Phillip II). During the 19th century, the parish was integrated into the municipality of Odemira, during the administrative reforms of Mouzinho da Silveira. Vila Nova do Milfontes was involved in Portuguese aviation, being one of the first points between Portugal and Macau, completed by Brito Paes (a citizen of Colos in Vila Nova de Milfontes) and Sarmento Beires. On 7 April 1924, these pilots left Campo dos Coitos, near Milfontes on their voyage to the Far East. In homage to the aviators and their historic flight, in the Pra√ßa da Barbac√£ (alongside the fort), a monument was erected to mark their voyage. Geography The coastal beach with the main centre of Vila Nova de Milfontes in the background Vila Nova de Milfontes is located along the western coast of Atlantic Ocean on the northern margin of the Mira River, falling within the Nature Park of the Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast. Vila Nova de Milfontes is dominated by a large estuary and ecosystem, dominated by the Mira River that gives shelter to several species of birds and marine life, in addition to wild boar and fox in the surrounding woods.

In fact, the region has developed an aquaculture centre nearby in Moinho da Asneira. Moreover, sport fishing, diving, pedestrian trails, horse trails and all-terrain sports are promoted for amateur tourists, supported by a local service economy designed on tourism. Moreover, the surrounding area offers ecological tourism, paragliding training, a small safari park and beautiful hideouts with small waterfalls.

He participated in combat in World War One, with the 15th Infantry of the Corpo Expedicionario de Portugal (Portuguese Expeditionary Corp), where he received the War Cross and French Legion of Honour. At the end of the War he was assigned the command of the Bombardment and Observation Squadron of the Republic Aviation Squadron, and in 1920, along with Sarmento Beires, made an attempt to link Madeira by air. In 1924, along with Sarmento Beires and Manuel Gouveia, they completed the first air voyage between Portugal and Macau, in their airplane ‚ÄúP√°tria‚Äù, which departed Vila Nova de Milfontes. * Cust√≥dio Br√°s Pacheco (1828-1883), politician, journalist and association leader; Pacheco, a tobacco factory worker in Lisbon, in 1878 he became a candidate for the Republican Party during that year's elections.

Background In 1958, Fidel Castro ordered his revolutionary army to go on the offensive against the army of Fulgencio Batista. While Castro led one force against Guisa, Mas√≥ and other towns, another major offensive was directed at the capture of the city of Santa Clara, the capital of what was then Las Villas Province. Three columns were sent against Santa Clara under the command of Che Guevara, Jaime Vega, and Camilo Cienfuegos. Vega's column was caught in an ambush and completely destroyed. Guevara's column took up positions around Santa Clara (near Fomento). Cienfuegos's column directly attacked a local army garrison at Yaguajay. Initially numbering just 60 men out of Castro's hardened core of 230, Cienfuegos's group had gained many recruits as it crossed the countryside towards Santa Clara, eventually reaching an estimated strength of 450 to 500 fighters. The battle The garrison consisted of some 250 men under the command of a Cuban captain of Chinese ancestry, Alfredo Abon Lee.Cap√≠tulo V ‚Äì La Batalla de Yaguajay , Museo Monumento Nacional Camilo CienfuegosLa Batalla de Yaguajay , Radio Caribe en la Isla de la Juventud Cuba The attack seems to have started around the 19 December. Convinced that reinforcements would be sent from Santa Clara, Lee put up a determined defense of his post. The guerrillas repeatedly attempted to overpower Lee and his men, but failed each time. By the 26 December Camilo Cienfuegos had become quite frustrated; it seemed that Lee could not be overpowered, nor could he be convinced to surrender. In desperation, Cienfuegos tried using a homemade tank against Lee's position. The \\"tank\\" was actually a large tractor encased in iron plates with attached makeshift flamethrowers on top. It, too, proved unsuccessful. Finally, on the 30 December Lee ran out of ammunition and was forced surrendered his force to the guerrillas. Aftermath Central part of the battle's monument and plaza with the statue of Camilo Cienfuegos The surrender of the garrison was a major blow to the defenders of the provincial capital of Santa Clara. The next day, the combined forces of Cienfuegos, Guevara, and local revolutionaries under William Alexander Morgan captured the city in a fight of vast confusion. Panicked by news of the defeat at Santa Clara and other losses, Batista fled Cuba the next day.

During a relatively brief period of fame and success, he produced two of the most critically acclaimed reggae singles of the 1980s. He died on 15 March 2011, aged 48, during a police raid on his home. An inquest found that his death was a suicide.

Prior to his recording career he worked as a DJ with many of London's reggae sound systems, most often with the Saxon Studio International system, where he met and worked with a number of other reggae artists, including Maxi Priest, Papa Levi and Tippa Irie.O'Hagan, Sean (1985) \\"1st Offender\\", NME, 2 February 1985, p. 10-11 Signed to the London-based reggae record label Fashion Records, his first single \\"Cockney Translation\\" (1984) was a Jamaican's guide to the East End dialect: \\"Cockneys have names like Terry, Arfur and Del Boy/We have names like Winston, Lloyd and Leroy\\". The song mixed cockney dialect with London's version of Jamaican patois, translating between the two.Hewitt, Roger: \\"Language, Youth and the Destabilisation of Ethnicity\\" (1992), in Harris, Roxy & Rampton, Ben (2003) The Language, Ethnicity and Race Reader, Routledge, , p. 194Zuberi, Nabeel (2001) Sounds English: Transnational Popular Music, University of Illinois Press, , p. 135 Simon Reynolds has often cited this song in his writings, arguing that it presaged the creation of a new hybrid accent in which white East Londoners would adopt many terms of black origin. The song's lyric was later used in schools as an example of how immigration has affected the English language. Smiley Culture popularised the \\"fast chat\\" style of deejaying that had originated with Jamaican deejays such as Ranking Joe, and was developed further by British toasters, particularly those on the Saxon sound system such as Peter King.Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (2004) The Rough Guide to Reggae, 3rd edn., Rough Guides, , p. 401 Emmanuel had chart success with his next single, \\"Police Officer\\", released towards the end of 1984.

The success of \\"Police Officer\\" prompted a re-release of \\"Cockney Translation\\". It picked up considerable airplay on BBC Radio One and sold over 40,000 copies in total, but only reached the lower end of the UK Singles Chart.

His death was investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. In their final report ‚Äì which at the request of the coroner was neither made public nor made available to Emmanuel's family ‚Äì the IPCC concluded that there was no evidence justifying the pressing of criminal charges against any of the four officers present at the house during the raid. In the IPCC statement following the inquest ‚Äì which returned a verdict of suicide ‚Äì it was stated that there was neither criminal conduct by officers, nor individual failings by officers that might amount to misconduct. Nonetheless, the report also pointed out flaws in the police raid and called on the Metropolitan Police Service to improve the planning and execution of their drug seizures. However, Smiley's family raised concerns about the investigation, claiming that the IPCC \\"had let [them] down\\" and that many \\"unanswered questions\\" remained. The conditions surrounding his death and the subsequent investigation were also questioned by members of the general public, his death often being considered in the context of police brutality and other black people dying in police custody. A study into the causes and consequences of the 2011 United Kingdom riots, led by the London School of Economics in collaboration with the British newspaper The Guardian, identified Emmanuel's death, perceived by some as a prominent case of police abuse, as a contributing factor to the riots.

This was formerly considered to be a monotypic family of which the banjofish was the only species. However, in 2017, two new species of banjofishes were described, the East Australian banjofish (B. aculeatus) and the Timor Sea banjofish (B. peregrinus). It has an Indo-Pacific distribution. Description Banjos banjos has a deep and strongly compressed body with a steep head and an almost straight dorsal profile. The dorsal fin has 10 flattened spines and 12 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines with the second being far longer the others, the anal fin also contains 7 soft rays.The caudal fin is slightly emarginate, It has a compete and continuous lateral line. In colour it is silvery white to greyish-brown, fading towards the belly, the anterior part of the head is blackish with whitish lips. The second dorsal fin has a white margin and a sizeable, circular black blotch to the front. The caudal fin has a wide brown submarginal band. Smaller fishes show a number of ill-defined dark stripes on their flanks and a large black spot on the base of the tail.

Habitat and biology Banjos banjos is an inshore species which can be found at depths between . Taxonomy Banjos banjos was first formally described as Anoplus banjos in 1846 by Scottish naval surgeon, naturalist and arctic explorer Sir John Richardson (1797-1865) with the type locality given as the Sea of Japan. B. banjos was previously considered to be the only species in the family Banjosidae but in 2017 Matsunuma & Motomura described two new species, the East Australian banjofish (Banjos acuteatus) and the Timor Sea banjofish (Banjos peregrinus) and a new subspecies of B. banjos (see below).

It was first synthesized by Moses Gomberg in 1898.  Synthesis  Gomberg's classical organic synthesis shown below starts by reacting triphenylmethyl bromide 1 with phenylhydrazine 2 to the hydrazine 3. Oxidation with nitrous acid then produces the azo compound 4 from which on heating above the melting point, nitrogen gas evolves with formation of tetraphenylmethane 5. :Gomberg's tetraphenylmethane synthesis Gomberg was able to distinguish this compound from triphenylmethane (elemental analysis was not an option given the small differences in the hydrogen fractions of 6.29% and 6.60%) by nitration of 5 with nitric acid to 6. A strong base would be able to abstract the methine proton of the nitrated triphenylmethyl compound if present, forming a strongly colored compound. He obtained further evidence for the formation of tetraphenylmethane by reducing the nitro groups to amino groups with zinc dust in acetic acid to the leuco dye 7, which on exposure to hydrochloric acid eliminates aniline to the known compound pararosaniline 8. Gomberg's success in synthesizing tetraphenylmethane set him on the attempt to prepare the next homologue hexaphenylethane, which led him to the discovery of the triphenylmethyl radical.

Fruttuaria is an abbey in the territory of San Benigno Canavese, about twenty kilometers north of Turin, northern Italy. History The abbey was founded by Guglielmo da Volpiano. The first stone was laid 23 February 1003, consecrated by Ottobiano, bishop of Ivrea, in the presence of Arduin, marchese d'Ivrea and King of Italy, and his consort Berta. The monastery was completed in 1006-1007 and followed the Benedictine rule as reformed at Cluny. There Arduin retired to die (December 1015). In 1027 a bull of Pope John XIX placed the abbey and all its lands under direct papal supervision. The Empress Agnes was a patron of Fruttuaria, and retired there in 1065 before moving to Rome. The Empress was instrumental in introducing Fruttuaria's Benedictine customs, as practiced at Cluny, to Saint Blaise Abbey in Baden-W√ºrttemberg.Robinson, I. S., Henry IV of Germany 1056-1106, Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 126 The greatest splendor of the abbey of Fruttuaria was in the 12th and 13th centuries when it minted its own coin. In 1265 the abbey possessed eighty-five churches in Italy alone, as well as four comunes, the quattro terre abbaziali of San Benigno Canavese, Montanaro, Lombardore and Foglizzo. Other possessions lay in France and Austria. Some 1,200 monks inhabited the monastery. In the 14th century, decline set in, culminating in 1477 when the monks lost their privilege of naming the abbot. Nominating an absentee abbot in commendam and a vicar to represent him at the site was thenceforth a papal perquisite. In 1585 Pope Sixtus V suppressed the monastery, substituting in its buildings a college of secular priests. The last monk died in 1634. In 1710 troops of Victor Amadeus II, duke of Savoy, occupied the terre abbaziali, an occupation that lasted until 1741 and only ended with papal renunciation of all territorial control. In 1749, a new abbot held Fruttuaria in commendam, Carlo Vittorio Amedeo delle Lanze, who in 1770 razed the remains of the Romanesque church and monastery, save the campanile, and erected a new church in their stead, to Late Baroque classicizing designs by Bernardo Antonio Vittone and Mario Quarini. In 1979, work involved in installing heating brought to light an 11th-century mosaic representing two griffons. Excavations have revealed the foundations of the Romanesque church. Restorations were concluded in May 2004.

Geography Location Schwabm√ºnchen lies about 20 km south of Augsburg between Lech and Wertach on the western edge of the Lechfeld, a gravel plain. Through the city flows the river Singold. In the west, about 5 km from town in the residential area of Stauden rise the Westliche W√§lder, or Western Forests. Neighbouring communities North of Schwabm√ºnchen, about 3 km away, lies Gro√üaitingen. Furthermore, Schwabm√ºnchen is surrounded by Untermeitingen to the southeast, Langerringen to the south and Hiltenfingen to the southwest, as well as, about 10 km away in the Stauden ‚Äì an area of gentle wooded hills and cultivated dales ‚Äì Mickhausen to the northwest. City divisions In 1978, as a result of Bavarian municipal reform, the following communities were amalgamated into Schwabm√ºnchen: * Birkach, with a population today of 186, was mentioned in a document as early as 969 under the name \\"Pirichah\\" as a domain of Saint Stephen's Convent (\\"Kloster St. Stephan\\") in Augsburg. It lies about 7 km from Schwabm√ºnchen in the Schwarzachtal (valley). * Klimmach, with a population today of 255 already existed in the early Middle Ages, but was only first mentioned in a document in 1482. Klimmach is an important pilgrimage place in the Bishopric of Augsburg. Klimmach lies about 6 km west from Schwabm√ºnchen on the heights between the Wertach Plain (\\"Wertachebene\\") and the Schwarzachtal. * Mittelstetten with 571 inhabitants. * Schwabegg, which today has 781 inhabitants, had its first documentary mention in 1110. It lies about 5 km west of Schwabm√ºnchen at the edge of the rise towards the Stauden area and the Wertach Plain. History Schwabm√ºnchen was first mentioned in writing in 954 as \\"castellum Mantahinga\\" in a biography of Saint Ulrich, Bishop of Augsburg. From archaeological digs in the north of the modern city have come clues of Celtic, Roman and Alamannic peoples dwelling in the area in bygone ages. In 1562, Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I raised the community to market town and bestowed upon it a market town's coat of arms. In the years from 1804 to 1806, Schwabm√ºnchen came under Bavarian rule, having formerly belonged to the Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg (Augsburger Hochstift). On 4 March 1945, late in the Second World War, Schwabm√ºnchen was beset by a heavy air raid, which killed 60 inhabitants. One fourth of the town was utterly destroyed, and two thirds of it was heavily damaged. After the war, the population rose dramatically owing to the great number of refugees flowing into the town, and in 1953, Schwabm√ºnchen was raised from market town to city. In 1972, the former district of Schwabm√ºnchen was merged with the district of Wertingen to form the current district of Augsburg. Population growth 1840: 3,438 inhabitants 1900: 4,751 1939: 5,453 1970: 9,200 2005: 13,806 Politics Distribution of places on the 24-seat city council (as of municipal elections in 2008) is as follows: * CSU: 13 seats * SPD: 4 seats * Freie W√§hlervereinigung (citizens' coalition): 7 seats Since 2008, Lorenz M√ºller (CSU) has been mayor of Schwabm√ºnchen. City partnership Since 7 June 1975, there has been a city partnership between Schwabm√ºnchen and the city of Giromagny in France. Giromagny lies 12 km north of Belfort at the foot of the Vosges mountains. Culture and sightseeing Hexent√ºrmchen (\\"Witches' turrets\\") at the city hall Worth seeing is one of Schwabm√ºnchen's landmarks, the Hexent√ºrmchen, or Witches' turrets, flanking a gateway at the city hall that once led into the episcopal Stra√üvogtei, or \\"road bailiwick\\", the name given the area for the important ancient road that led through it. The turrets were apparently built in the 16th century. Another thing to see is the Strickerbrunnen, or \\"Knitter Fountain\\", at Schrannenplatz. It was created by sculptor Karl-Ulrich Nuss. To the right and the left, underneath the knitter stand a lamb and a goat. According to one story, if two people sit on these animals at the same time, they will be lifelong friends. Every year on the last weekend of September, the local fair Michaelimarkt takes place. Economy and infrastructure Transport Schwabm√ºnchen is the terminal stop on the Augsburger Verkehrsverbund, the Augsburg area's transport system. Trains run half-hourly to Buchloe and Augsburg on the Augsburg‚ÄìBuchloe railway. Through ringroads and feeder roads, the town is connected with Bundesstra√üe (Federal Highway) 17 which leads to Augsburg and Landsberg am Lech, and which is built quite similarly to an Autobahn.

The area of responsibility is the town of Schwabm√ºnchen itself and the towns Graben, Gro√üaitingen, Hiltenfingen, Kleinaitingen, Klosterlechfeld, Langenneufnach, Langerringen, Mickhausen, Mittelneufnach, Scherstetten, Schwabm√ºnchen, Untermeitingen and Walkertshofen. Rescue service The rescue station of the Bavarian Red Cross is located at the Fuggerstra√üe 42 in Schwabm√ºnchen. Here an emergency physician vehicle, a rescue ambulance and a patient transport ambulance are stationed. There is no fixed area of responsibility for the rescue service. The pupblic-safety answering point (PSAP) of Augsburg is responsible for alerting the rescue service. The PSAP is always alerting the closest rescue vehicle to an emergency. Administrative borders like counties etc. do not matter here. The area of operation is about the south of Augsburg County and the town of Augsburg itself. Fire brigade The fire station of the volunteer fire brigade of Schwabm√ºnchen is located at the Riedstra√üe 91in Schwabm√ºnchen. Here a L√∂schzug (platoon for fire fighting) and a R√ºstzug (platoon for technical help, e.g. road accidents) are stationed. The PSAP of Augsburg is responsible for alerting the fire brigade, also. Therefore, there is no fixed area of responsibility for the fire brigade. The area of operation is about the town of Schwabm√ºnchen itself and for support all other districts of Schwabm√ºnchen and the surrounding towns. The districts Schwabegg, Birkach, Klimmach and Mittelstetten do have independent fire brigades. The fire brigade of Schwabegg is equipped with a medium fire truck (L√∂schgruppenfahrzeug), the other districts are equipped with one small fire truck, each.

They originated in northwest regions of the India and left sometime between the 6th and 11th century to work in Middle Eastern courts of their own volition, or as slaves. A small number of nomadic groups were cut off from their return to the subcontinent by conflicts and moved west, eventually settling in Europe, the Byzantine Empire and North Africa via Iran. Origin The initial arrival of Romani outside Bern in the 15th century, described by the chronicler as getoufte heiden \\"baptized heathens\\" and drawn wearing Saracene style clothes and weapons (Spiezer Schilling, p. 749). The Romani have been described by Diana Muir Appelbaum as unique among peoples because they have never identified themselves with a territory; they have no tradition of an ancient and distant homeland from which their ancestors migrated, nor do they claim the right to national sovereignty in any of the lands where they reside. Rather, Romani identity is bound up with the ideal of freedom expressed, in part, in having no ties to a homeland.Appelbaum, Diana, \\"The Rootless Roma\\", The American Interest The absence of a written history has meant that the origin and early history of the Romani people was long an enigma. Indian origin was suggested on linguistic grounds as early as the late 18th century. The Roma origin story is as follows: \\"In addition to Challah, his female partner and Sharkano the serpent, O'del (the creator god of the Romani people) also created Sunto Avraham, Sunto Jacov, Sunto Krechuno, Sunto Moishel and Faravono, otherwise known as the Suntsi: the Romani's ancestors. Originally the Suntsi lived as one people, a single race that spoke the same tongue, until the treachery of Faravono, who split from the pack and prompted the disunity and partitioning of mankind. Thenceforth humankind was divided into two groups: the Faravonouria governed by Faravono, and the Horaxane led by a Suntsi named Sin Petri. At first, the Faravonouria kept to themselves, but over time they began to rapidly multiply. Their arrogance and fearlessness grew threefold, so much so that they elected to conquer the world. Faravono waged war against Sin Petri, unaware that Sin Petri was in fact O'del in disguise. Blinded by ignorance, Faravono and his warriors crossed the Pryd River. But Sin Petri conjured up his powers and raised a mighty tide that crashed over them with the force of one hundred waterfalls. The desperate Faravono, realizing their errors, attempted to solicit aid from a false stone idol which further angered Sin Petri, who punished the traitors with the spear of a thunderbolt. Rain cascaded down from the skies until the entire world was flooded over. Hovering above the flood, Sin Petri transported his loyal Horaxane to the Raiyo, the world above the stars, destroyed the tainted earth and created a world twice its original size. Faravono and most of the Faravonouria on the other hand were sent to their watery graves and descended to Yado, the underworld abyss for evil souls. Sin Petri showed some mercy to what was left of the Faravonouria, said to be the Romani. Though they were granted permission to live on O'del's new earth, they were doomed to live in an eternity of self-isolation, prohibited from claiming ownership of their own national territory, banned from joining any political or religious organization as well as any other physical form of individual identity. Their culture, as the Romani grew to accept, had been washed away by O'del's flood.\\"editor=River, Charles. The Roma: The History of the Romani People and the Controversial Persecutions of Them across Europe. In the Roma language \\"Roma\\" means \\"a person\\". Other theories suggest that the name derives from a form ·∏ç≈çmba, \\"man of low caste living by singing and music\\", attested in Classical Sanskrit.Cf. Ralph L. Turner, A comparative dictionary of the Indo- Aryan languages, p. 314. London: Oxford University Press, 1962-6. Many also believe that Gypsies are descendants of Dalit because of the word zingaro (Œ±œÑœÉŒØŒ≥Œ≥Œ±ŒΩŒøœÇ) (untouchable) that was used to designate gypsies in Greece. Another alternative view is that the ancestors of the Romani were part of the military in Northern India. When there were invasions by Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi and these soldiers were defeated, they were moved west with their families into the Byzantine Empire between AD 1000 and 1030. The genetic evidence identified an Indian origin for Roma.Isabel Mendizabal and 21 others, \\"Reconstructing the Population History of European Romani from Genome-wide Data\\", Current Biology, Available online 6 December 2012, accessed 12 December 2012\\"Genomic Study Traces Roma to Northern India\\", New York Times, 11 December 2012. Findings recently reported also in Current Biology. Genetic evidence connects the Romani people to the descendants of groups which emigrated from South Asia towards Central Asia during the medieval period.Hancock, Ian. Ame Sam e Rromane D≈æene/We are the Romani people. p. 13. Language origins Until the mid-to-late 18th century, theories of the origin of the Romani were mostly speculative. In 1782, Johann Christian Christoph R√ºdiger published his research that pointed out the relationship between the Romani language and Hindustani. Subsequent work supported the hypothesis that Romani shared a common origin with the Indo-Aryan languages of Northern India, with Romani grouping most closely with Sinhalese in a recent study. Domari and Romani language Domari was once thought to be the \\"sister language\\" of Romani, the two languages having split after the departure from the South Asia, but more recent research suggests that the differences between them are significant enough to treat them as two separate languages within the Central zone (Hindustani) Saraiki language group of languages. The Dom and the Rom are therefore likely to be descendants of two different migration waves from the Indian subcontinent, separated by several centuries. Genetic evidence Further evidence for the South Asian origin of the Romanies came in the late 1990s. Researchers doing DNA analysis discovered that Romani populations carried large frequencies of particular Y chromosomes (inherited paternally) and mitochondrial DNA (inherited maternally) that otherwise exist only in populations from South Asia. 47.3% of Romani men carry Y chromosomes of haplogroup H-M82 which is rare outside South Asia. Mitochondrial haplogroup M, most common in Indian subjects and rare outside Southern Asia, accounts for nearly 30% of Romani people. A more detailed study of Polish Roma shows this to be of the M5 lineage, which is specific to India. Moreover, a form of the inherited disorder congenital myasthenia is found in Romani subjects. This form of the disorder, caused by the 1267delG mutation, is otherwise known only in subjects of Indian ancestry. This is considered to be the best evidence of the Indian ancestry of the Romanis. The Romanis have been described as \\"a conglomerate of genetically isolated founder populations\\". The number of common Mendelian disorders found among Romanis from all over Europe indicates \\"a common origin and founder effect\\". A study from 2001 by Gresham et al. suggests \\"a limited number of related founders, compatible with a small group of migrants splitting from a distinct caste or tribal group\\". Also the study pointed out that \\"genetic drift and different levels and sources of admixture, appear to have played a role in the subsequent differentiation of populations\\". The same study found that \\"a single lineage ... found across Romani populations, accounts for almost one-third of Romani males. A 2004 study by Morar et al. concluded that the Romanies are \\"a founder population of common origins that has subsequently split into multiple socially divergent and geographically dispersed Gypsy groups\\". The same study revealed that this population \\"was founded approximately 32‚Äì40 generations ago, with secondary and tertiary founder events occurring approximately 16‚Äì25 generations ago\\". Connection to the Burushos and Pamiris The Burushos of Hunza have a paternal lineage genetic marker that is grouped with Pamiri speakers from Afghanistan and Tajikistan, and the Sinti or Sindhi Romani ethnic group. This find of shared genetic haplogroups may indicate an origin of the Romani people in or around these regions.The Eurasian Heartland: A continental perspective on Y-chromosome diversity , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. Possible connection to the Domba people According to a genetic study on The Phylogeography of Y-Chromosome Haplogroup H1a1a-M82 in 2012, the ancestors of present scheduled tribes and scheduled caste populations of northern India, traditionally referred to collectively as the ·∏åoma, are the likely ancestral populations of modern European Roma. A mtdna or ydna study provides valuable information but a limitation of these studies is that they represent only one instantiation of the genealogical process. Autosomal data permits simultaneous analysis of multiple lineages, which can provide novel information about population history. According to a genetic study on autosomal data on Roma the source of South Asian Ancestry in Roma is North-West India. The two populations showing closest relatedness to Roma were Punjabis and Kashmiris which also happen to have the highest West Eurasian related ancestry amongst South Asians.Moorjani et al. Reconstructing Roma history from genome-wide data PDF However according to a study on genome- wide data published in 2019 the putative origin of the proto Roma involves a Punjabi group with low levels of West Eurasian ancestry. The classical and mtDNA genetic markers suggested the closest affinity of the Roma with Rajput and Punjabi populations from Rajasthan and the Punjab respectively. Early records Many ancient historians mention a tribe by the name of Sigynnae (Tsigani) on various locations in Europe. Early records of itinerant populations from India begin as early as the Sassanid period. British linguist Donald Kenrick notes the first recorded presence of Zott in Baghdad in AD 420, Khaneikin in AD 834. Contemporary scholars have suggested one of the first written references to the Romanies, under the term \\"Atsingani\\", (derived from the Greek ·ºÄœÑœÉŒØŒ≥Œ≥Œ±ŒΩŒøŒπ - atsinganoi), dates from the Byzantine era during a time of famine in the 9th century. In the year AD 800, Saint Athanasia gave food to \\"foreigners called the Atsingani\\" near Thrace. Later, in AD 803, Theophanes the Confessor wrote that Emperor Nikephoros I had the help of the \\"Atsingani\\" to put down a riot with their \\"knowledge of magic\\". However, the Atsingani were a Manichean sect that disappeared from chronicles in the 11th century. \\"Atsinganoi\\" was used to refer to itinerant fortune tellers, ventriloquists and wizards who visited the Emperor Constantine IX in the year 1054. The hagiographical text, The Life of St. George the Anchorite, mentions that the \\"Atsingani\\" were called on by Constantine to help rid his forests of the wild animals which were killing off his livestock. Arrival in Europe The migration of the Romani people through the Middle East and Northern Africa to Europe. The key shows the century of arrival in that area, e.g. S.XII is the 12th century In 1323 Simon Simeonis, an Irish Franciscan friar, described people in likeness to the \\"atsingani\\" living in Crete: We also saw outside this city [Candia] a tribe of people, who worship according to the Greek rite, and assert themselves to be of the race of Cain. These people rarely or never stop in one place for more than thirty days, but always, as if cursed by God, are nomad and outcast. After the thirtieth day they wander from field to field with small, oblong, black, and low tents, like those of the Arabs, and from cave to cave, because the place inhabited by them becomes after the term of thirty days so full of vermin and other filth that it is impossible to live in their neighbourhood. 1350 Ludolf von Sudheim mentioned a similar people with a unique language whom he called Mandapolos, a word which some theorize was possibly derived from the Greek word Mantipolos - ŒúŒ±ŒΩœÑŒπœÄœåŒªŒøœÇ \\"frenzied\\" from mantis - ŒºŒ¨ŒΩœÑŒπœÇ (meaning \\"prophet, fortune teller\\") and poleo - œÄŒøŒªŒ≠œâ. Around 1360, a fiefdom (called the Feudum Acinganorum) was established in Corfu. It mainly used Romani serfs and the Romanies on the island were subservient.Bright Balkan morning: Romani lives & the power of music in Greek Macedonia, Charles Keil et al, 2002, p.108The Gypsies, Angus M. Fraser, 1995, pp.50-51 By the 14th century, the Romanies had reached the Balkans and Bohemia; by the 15th century, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Portugal; and by the 16th century, Russia, Denmark, Scotland and Sweden. (although DNA evidence from mid-11th century skeletons in Norwich suggest that at least a few individuals may have arrived earlier, perhaps due to Viking enslavement of Romani from the eastern Mediterranean or liaisons with the VarangiansPitts, M. (2006) DNA Surprise: Romani in England 440 years too early. British Archaeology 89 (July/August): 9). Some Romanies migrated from Persia through North Africa, reaching Europe via Spain in the 15th century. The two currents met in France. Romanies began immigrating to the United States in colonial times, with small groups in Virginia and French Louisiana. Larger-scale immigration began in the 1860s, with groups of Romnichal from Britain. The largest number immigrated in the early 20th century, mainly from the Vlax group of Kalderash. Many Romanies also settled in Latin America. According to historian Norman Davies, a 1378 law passed by the governor of Nauplion in the Greek Peloponnese confirming privileges for the \\"atsingani\\" is \\"the first documented record of Romany Gypsies in Europe\\". Similar documents, again representing the Romanies as a group that had been exiled from Egypt, record them reaching Bra≈üov, Transylvania in 1416; Hamburg, Holy Roman Empire in 1418; and Paris in 1427. A chronicler for a Parisian journal described them as dressed in a manner that the Parisians considered shabby, and reports that the Church had them leave town because they practiced palm-reading and fortune- telling. Their early history shows a mixed reception. Although 1385 marks the first recorded transaction for a Romani slave in Wallachia, they were issued safe conduct by Sigismund of the Holy Roman Empire in 1417. Romanies were ordered expelled from the Meissen region of Germany in 1416, Lucerne in 1471, Milan in 1493, France in 1504, Aragon in 1512, Sweden in 1525, England in 1530 (see Egyptians Act 1530), and Denmark in 1536. In 1510, any Romani found in Switzerland were ordered to be put to death, with similar rules established in England in 1554, Denmark in 1589, and Sweden in 1637, whereas Portugal began deportations of Romanies to its colonies in 1538. Later, a 1596 English statute, however, gave Romanies special privileges that other wanderers lacked; France passed a similar law in 1683. Catherine the Great of Russia declared the Romanies \\"crown slaves\\" (a status superior to serfs), but also kept them out of certain parts of the capital. In 1595, ≈ûtefan RƒÉzvan overcame his birth into slavery, and became the Voivode (Prince) of Moldavia. In Wallachia, Transylvania and Moldavia, Romanies were enslaved for five centuries, until abolition in the mid-19th century. In the late 19th century, the Romani culture inspired in their neighbors a wealth of artistic works. Among the most notable works are Carmen and La Vie de Boh√®me. Settlement In 1758, Maria Theresa of Austria began a program of assimilation to turn Romanies into ujmagyar (new Hungarians). The government built permanent huts to replace mobile tents, forbade travel, and forcefully removed children from their parents to be fostered by non-Romani. By 1894, the majority of Romanies counted in a Hungarian national census were sedentary. In 1830, Romani children in Nordhausen were taken from their families to be fostered by Germans. Russia also encouraged settlement of all nomads in 1783, and the Polish introduced a settlement law in 1791. Bulgaria and Serbia banned nomadism in the 1880s. In 1783, racial legislation against Romanies was repealed in the United Kingdom, and a specific \\"Turnpike Act\\" was established in 1822 to prevent nomads from camping on the roadside, strengthened in the Highways Act of 1835. Persecution In 1530, England issued the Egyptians Act which banned Romani from entering the country and required those living in the country to leave within 16 days. Failure to do so could result in the confiscation of property, imprisonment and deportation. The act was amended with the Egyptians Act 1554, which ordered the Romani to leave the country within a month. Non-complying Romanies were executed. In 1538, the first anti- ziganist (anti-Romani) legislation was issued in Moravia and Bohemia, which were under Habsburg rule. Three years later, after a series of fires in Prague which were blamed on the Romani, Ferdinand I ordered them to be expelled. In 1545, the Diet of Augsburg declared that \\"whoever kills a Gypsy, will be guilty of no murder\\". The massive killing spree that resulted prompted the government to eventually step in and \\"forbid the drowning of Romani women and children\\".Crowe (2004) p.35 In 1660, Romanies were prohibited from residence in France by Louis XIV. In 1685, Portugal deported Romani to Brasil. In 1710, Joseph I issued a decree declaring the extermination of Romani ordering that \\"all adult males were to be hanged without trial, whereas women and young males were to be flogged and banished forever.\\" In addition, they were to have their right ears cut off in the kingdom of Bohemia and their left ear in Moravia. In 1721, Charles VI, Joseph's brother and successor, amended the decree to include the execution of adult female Romani, while children were \\"to be put in hospitals for education\\". David Crowe (2004): A History of the Gypsies of Eastern Europe and Russia (Palgrave Macmillan) p.XI p.36-37 Pre- war organization In 1879, a national meeting of Romanies was held in the Hungarian town of Kisfalu (now Porda≈°inci, Slovenia). Romanies in Bulgaria set up a conference in 1919 to protest for their right to vote, and a Romani journal, Istiqbal (Future) was founded in 1923. In the Soviet Union, the All- Russian Union of Gypsies was organized in 1925 with a journal, Romani Zorya (Romani Dawn) beginning two years later. The Romengiro Lav (Romani Word) writer's circle encouraged works by authors like Nikolay Aleksandrovich Pankov and Nina Dudarova. A General Association of the Gypsies of Romania was established in 1933 with a national conference, and two journals, Neamul »öiganesc (Gypsy Nation) and Timpul (Time). An \\"international\\" conference was organized in Bucharest the following year. In Yugoslavia, Romani journal Romano Lil started publication in 1935. Porajmos During World War II, the Nazis murdered 220,000 to 500,000 Romanies in a genocide which is referred to as the Porajmos. Like the Jews, they were segregated into ghettos before they were sent to concentration camps or extermination camps. They were often killed on sight, especially by the Einsatzgruppen on the Eastern Front. 25% of European Roma perished in the genocide. Post-war history In Communist central and eastern Europe, Romanies experienced assimilation schemes and restrictions of cultural freedom. The Romani language and Romani music were banned from public performance in Bulgaria. In Czechoslovakia, tens of thousands of Romanies from Slovakia, Hungary and Romania were re-settled in border areas of Czech lands and their nomadic lifestyle was forbidden. In Czechoslovakia, where they were labelled as a ‚Äúsocially degraded stratum,‚Äù Romani women were sterilized as part of a state policy to reduce their population. This policy was implemented with large financial incentives, threats of denying future social welfare payments, misinformation and involuntary sterilization.Silverman, Carol. \\"Persecution and Politicization: Roma (Gypsies) of Eastern Europe.\\" Cultural Survival Quarterly, Summer 1995. Helsinki Watch. Struggling for Ethnic Identity: Czechoslovakia‚Äôs Endangered Gypsies. New York, 1991. In the early 1990s, Germany deported tens of thousands of migrants to central and eastern Europe. Sixty percent of some 100,000 Romanian nationals deported under a 1992 treaty were Romani.New York Times - Germany and Romania in Deportation Pact dated 24 September 1992 Retrieved 19 July 2017. During the 1990s and early 21st century, many Romanies from central and eastern Europe attempted to migrate to western Europe or Canada. The majority of them were turned back. Several of these countries established strict visa requirements to prevent further migration. In 2005, the Decade of Roma Inclusion was launched in nine Central and Southeastern European countries to improve the socio-economic status and social inclusion of the Romani minority across the region. A decade of Roma Inclusion 2005 - 2015 has not been successful at all. It initiated crucially important processes for Roma inclusion in Europe and provided the impetus for an EU-led effort covering the similar subject matter, the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 (EU Framework).European Commission - COM(2011)173. America Romanies began immigrating to the United States in colonial times, with small groups in Virginia and French Louisiana. Larger- scale immigration began in the 1860s, with groups of Romnichal from Britain. Czech-Canadian Exodus In August 1997, TV Nova, a popular television station in the Czech Republic, broadcast a documentary on the situation of Romanies who had emigrated to Canada.The Roma Exodus to Canada , romove.radio.cz The short report portrayed Romanies in Canada living comfortably with support from the state, and sheltered from racial discrimination and violence.ERRC Statement Regarding Canada as Haven for Roma, Patrin Web Journal, 17 April 1999 At the time, life was particularly difficult for many Romanies living in the Czech Republic. As a result of the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, many Romanies were left without citizenship in either the Czech Republic or Slovakia. Following the large flood in Moravia in July, many Romanies were left homeless yet unwelcome in other parts of the country. Almost overnight, there were reports of Romanies preparing to emigrate to Canada. According to one report, 5,000 Romani from the city of Ostrava intended to move. Mayors in some Czech towns encouraged the exodus, offering to help pay for flights so that Romanies could leave. The following week, the Canadian Embassy in Prague was receiving hundreds of calls a day from Romanies and flights between the Czech Republic and Canada were sold out until October. In 1997, 1,285 people from the Czech Republic arrived in Canada and claimed refugee status, a rather significant jump from the 189 Czechs who did so the previous year. Lucie Cermakova, a spokesperson at the Canadian Embassy in Prague, criticized the program, claiming it \\"presented only one side of the matter and picked out only nonsensical ideas.\\" Marie Jurkovicova, a spokesperson for the Czech Embassy in Ottawa suggested that \\"the program was full of half-truths, which strongly distorted reality and practically invited the exodus of large groups of Czech Romanies. It concealed a number of facts.\\" President V√°clav Havel and (after some hesitation) Prime Minister V√°clav Klaus attempted to convince the Romanies not to leave. With the help of Romani leaders like Emil Scuka, Chairman of the Roma Civic Initiative, they urged Romanies to remain in the country and work to solve their problems with the larger Czech population. The movement of Romanies to Canada had been fairly easy because visa requirements for Czech citizens had been lifted by the Canadian government in April 1996. In response to the influx of Romanies, the Canadian government reinstated the visa requirements for all Czechs as of 8 October 1997. Romani nationalism Flag of the Romani people A small Roma nationalist movement exists. The first World Romani Congress was organized in 1971 near London, funded in part by the World Council of Churches and the Government of India. It was attended by representatives from India and 20 other countries. At the congress, the green and blue flag from the 1933 conference, embellished with the red, sixteen-spoked chakra, was reaffirmed as the national emblem of the Romani people, and the anthem, \\"Gelem, Gelem\\" was adopted. The International Romani Union was officially established in 1977, and in 1990, the fourth World Congress declared April 8 to be International Day of the Roma, a day to celebrate Romani culture and raise awareness of the issues facing the Romani community. The 5th World Romany Congress in 2000 issued an official declaration of the Romany non-territorial nation.

History The Bank of the Argentine Nation was founded on 18 October 1891 by President Carlos Pellegrini, with the purpose of stabilizing the nation's finances following the Panic of 1890; its first director was Vicente Lorenzo Casares. In its early decades it became a leading financing source for agricultural smallholders, and later for commercial and industrial businesses, as well as handling an array of public sector transactions. The bank's reputation suffered after it was revealed that bribes had been received by the board of directors in 1994 when contacting IBM for the supply of computers, software, and communication equipment, becoming a prominent political scandal at the time. Services Long a significant supplier of domestic lending in a credit-tight economy, the bank attempted‚Äîwith only partial success‚Äîto revive the local credit market during the tenure of Gabriela Ciganotto, who stated the main goal of the bank in her inauguration speech in 2006 as \\"putting [the bank] at the service of production, especially small and medium businesses, and not of speculation.\\" the bank ranked 278th in the world in terms of tier one capital (US$ 1.623 billion, or 11% of deposits in December 2006) according to a global survey of top 1000 world banks carried out by The Banker, a Financial Times publication. Domestically, it has long been Argentina's largest bank; it maintained 626 branches, US$30 billion in deposits (28% of the domestic total), and a loan portfolio of US$15 billion (20% of the domestic total). Its lending profile is less oriented toward consumer or mortgage lending than other leading banks in Argentina; one third of its outstanding credit is to the public sector and 80% of the remainder is allocated to commercial loans. The public bank is giving to the people divers credit such as UVA credit for house mortgage.https://estudiomma.com.ar/credito-hipotecario-uva-que-va-pasar/ Headquarters The bank's headquarters are located in the San Nicol√°s neighborhood of Buenos Aires on the site of the Teatro Col√≥n's first building, bought by the national government in 1888 and later designated as main offices of the recently founded institution. The edifice was remodeled in 1910 by architect Adolfo B√ºttner to better suit its new role as a bank venue. In 1938 architect Alejandro Bustillo presented a new design for a much larger building in a revivalist, French-influenced, Monumental Neoclassical style. These new headquarters were built in two stages between 1940 and 1955. This building is also home to the Alejandro Bustillo Art Gallery, established in 1971, as well as to a historic and numismatic museum.

Biography Konopasek was born in Czechoslovakia and graduated from the Leningrad Textile Institute, Leningrad, USSR, and received the Ph.D. and D.Sc degrees from the University of Manchester, England. His career included management, research, and teaching positions in Czechoslovakia, United Kingdom, and the United States, including at the Georgia Institute of Technology and North Carolina State University. At Manchester in the late 1960s and early 1970s, he developed a system called \\"Question Answering System on mathematical models\\" (QAS).M. Konopasek, \\"An advanced question answering system on sets of algebraic equations\\", in Proceedings of the European Conference on Interactive Systems, ed. Lewin, 1975. He expected his system to be used by a broad range of non-computer professionals and non-mathematicians who apply math to their fields. Konopasek recognized that the new personal computer was an ideal vehicle for bringing his concept to the masses and developed a version of his system for them in 1977.M. Konopasek and M. Kazmierczak, \\"A question answering system on mathematical models in microcomputer environments\\", in Proceedings of a Conference on Personal and Home Computers ed. J. C. Warren, Computer Faire, San Francisco (1977). In 1982, Software Arts commercialized TK!Solver based on his work. Konopasek was Senior Scientist at Software Arts while holding a visiting faculty position in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at M.I.T.; when TK!Solver was sold to Universal Technical Systems (Rockford, Illinois), he continued as Vice President of UTS. Most of his research interests and contributions were in textile engineering, applied mechanics, operations research, and computer science, in areas as diverse as CAD/CAM, large deflection analysis of slender bodies, topology of line structures, and language design.

Buddhist traditions are represented in South Africa in many forms. Although the inherently introspective nature of Buddhism does not encourage census, adherents to these traditions are usually outspoken and supported by perhaps an even greater, though hidden number of sympathisers. Temples, centres and groups are common in the metropolitan areas and the country is thought to comprise the largest Buddhist community in Africa. History Apart from various Buddhist groups brought to the Cape Colony from Southeast Asia during the 1680s, and the many indentured labourers brought to Natal from India during the latter part of the 19th century (some of whom were Buddhist, and some of whom were Hindu who later converted to Buddhism once in South Africa), most Buddhists in South Africa are converts, and not Asian. Various Buddhist groups grew up in the major cities from the 1970s, and there has been a proliferation of distinct Buddhist traditions since the mid-1980s. These include Theravada, Zen, Nichiren and Tibetan schools. Sister Palmo (Freda Bedi) was instrumental in establishing the Karma Kagyu School of Tibetan Buddhism in South Africa when she visited in 1972. At the behest of the 16th Karmapa, Choje Akong Tulku Rinpoche set up Samye Dzong Dharma centres in the major South African cities, which are thriving today under guidance of the 17th Karmapa, Ogyen Drodul Trinley Dorje. The Fo Guang Shan Buddhist order has erected Nan Hua Temple, the largest Buddhist temple and monastery in Africa, in the town of Bronkhorstspruit near Pretoria. Another notable Buddhist centre in the country is the Buddhist Retreat Centre in Ixopo, KwaZulu-Natal. The Nichiren Buddhist lay group Soka Gakkai International has a community centre in Parkwood, Johannesburg. Derivatives of Korean Zen have been established in the Western Cape. The Vipassana Association of South Africa founded by S.N. Goenka has been holding meditation retreats in the Western Cape. More recent additions to the collection of schools include Shambala originally conceived by Ch√∂gyam Trungpa, Diamond Way Buddhism, a multicultural Lay Buddhist tradition under the guidance of H.H. 17th Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje and the New Kadampa tradition founded by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso. A 2003 study estimated that in the late 1990s there were a total of 6,000 Buddhists in South Africa (3,000 of whom had Asian ancestry) out of a total population of 42 million (or 0.01% of the total population). And according to the 2010s estimates, the Buddhist adherents (may included Taoism and Chinese Folk Religion) is increasing to between 0.2% 0.3% of the South African population, or between 100 and 150 thousand people while the number of practising Buddhists maybe low.  Dalai Lama's visits  Buddhist leaders often visit the country to bestow teachings and blessings. The Dalai Lama attended the Parliament of the World's Religions in 1999, and again in 2004, but was denied a visa when he was asked to attend an international peace conference in March 2009. As well when he was invited to South Africa for Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu's 80th birthday party on 7 October 2011. The 14th World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates was scheduled to take place in Cape Town, South Africa in 2014, but for the third time, the Dai Lai Lama had been refused a Visa. The summit was cancelled shortly afterwards when several other Nobel peace laureates cancelled their tickets in protest. The 14th peace summit was eventually relocated to Rome, Italy in December 2014.http://news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/SA-Nobel-Peace-summit- cancelled-reports-20141001https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/02/nobel- peace-summit-south-africa-dalai-lama-visa The South African foreign ministry denied that it had rejected the Dalai Lama's visa application, saying instead that the Tibetan spiritual leader had cancelled his trip, although it is very likely that relations with China was the main reason for the VISA being denied.http://thediplomat.com/2014/09/south-africa-prevents-dalai-lama-from- attending-nobel-peace-summit/ This is evident by two facts. Firstly, visas have been denied to the Dai Lai Lama before, and in almost every case the destination country had strong ties with China, and it has been claimed that China asked those governments not to accommodate the Nobel peace laureate. Also, in February 2014, the Chinese government reacted in anger as US President Barack Obama ignored their request to not meet with the exiled Tibetan leader.http://thediplomat.com/2015/02/china-warns-against-obama-dalai- lama-meeting/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/06/barack-obama- attacked-by-chinese-media-for-chumming-with-dalai-lama Secondly, at the time of the third refusal, the top spokesperson for international relations, Clayson Monyela, could not comment on the matter since he was in China on business.http://news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/Dalai-Lama-denied-visa-to- SA-for-a-third-time-20140904 Following the scandal, the Chinese government praised South Africa for their refusal of the visa, and international relations department spokesperson Clayson Monyela's final comment on the issue was that the Tibetan spiritual leader had cancelled his trip to South Africa and (that) his visa application was a closed matter. The Dalai Lama later confirmed the media reports when he publicly denounced the South African government during a speech he made in the northern Indian town of Dharamsala. He is quoted as saying, \\"The Nobel peace summit scheduled to be held in South Africa to honour the legacy of our fellow laureate, the late Nelson Mandela, has been cancelled as the South African government wouldn't allow me to attend it. This is sort of bullying a simple person.\\" At the 14th Summit, fellow laureate, Jody Williams also publicly denounced President Jacob Zuma's government, accusing them of \\"(selling) their soul and their sovereignty to China\\".https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/02/nobel-peace-summit-south- africa-dalai-lama-visa Notable South African Buddhists * Jerald Danasekera Vedan, Attorney, Author and Community Activist * Rob Nairn, Buddhist teacher, Author and Populariser * Antony Osler, advocate, author, Zen teacher. * Breyten Breytenbach, Afrikaans poet, Painter and Political Activist * Previn Asoka Vedan, Attorney, Human Rights Activist and Youth Leader Buddhist centres and groups in South Africa Western Cape *Diamond Way Buddhist Centre, Cape Town, Western Cape * Kagyu Samye Dzong ‚Äì Tibetan Buddhist Meditation Centre, Kenilworth, Cape Town * Sat Chit Anand Buddhist Centre, Plettenberg Bay, Western Cape *Home of Contemporary Zen in South Africa, Western Cape *Tushita Kadampa Buddhist Centre, Cape Town, Western Cape *Shambala Training Centre, Cape Town *Bodhi Khaya Retreat Centre, Gansbaai (Overberg region), Western Cape *Vipassana Association of South Africa, Worcester, Western Cape KwaZulu-Natal *Dharmagiri Buddhist Hermitage, KwaZulu-Natal *Buddhist Retreat Centre, Ixopo, KwaZulu-Natal *Kadampa Buddhist Centre Durban, KwaZulu-Natal Gauteng *JOHANNESBURG Shanti Kaya Meditation & Retreat Centre.

Much of his focus has been on dark fantasy and horror, although he does also work in science fiction and fantasy. Schweitzer is also a prolific writer of literary criticism and editor of collections of essays on various writers within his preferred genres. Life and career Schweitzer was born in Woodbury, New Jersey,Contemporary Authors Online, Detroit: Gale, 2007. son of Francis Edward and Mary Alice Schweitzer. He attended Villanova University from 1970 to 1976, from which he received a B.S. in geography (1974) and an M.A. in English (1976). He started his literary career as a reviewer and columnist. He worked as an editorial assistant for Isaac Asimov's SF Magazine from 1977 to 1982 and Amazing Stories from 1982 to 1986, was co-editor with George H. Scithers and John Gregory Betancourt of Weird Tales from 1987 to 1990 and sole editor of the same magazine from 1991 to 1994 and its successor, Worlds of Fantasy & Horror, from 1994 to 1996. From 1998 to 2007 he was again co-editor of the revived Weird Tales, first with Scithers and then with Scithers and Betancourt. He has also been a part-time literary agent for the Owlswick Agency in Philadelphia. and a World Fantasy Award judge. He is a member of Science Fiction Writers of America and Horror Writers of America. He lives and works in the Philadelphia area. Fiction Most of Schweitzer's fiction is in the areas of dark fantasy and horror. He works most frequently in fiction of shorter lengths, though he has also written a number of novels. His first, The White Isle, an epic, disillusioning quest to the underworld, was written in 1976 but remained unpublished until 1989. The Shattered Goddess (1982) takes place in a far future \\"Dying Earth\\" setting, which he later revisited for a sequence of short stories collected as Echoes of the Goddess (2013). The first work in his tales of the world of the Great River focusing on child-sorcerer Sekenre, \\"To Become a Sorcerer\\" (1991), was nominated for the 1992 World Fantasy Award for Best Novella and later expanded into the novel The Mask of the Sorcerer (1995). Additional stories in the series have been collected in Sekenre: The Book of the Sorcerer (2004). His latest novel, The Dragon House (2018), melds his customary dark tone with elements of humor in a lighter work for young adults. Other works include his stories of the lapsed knight Julian, most collected in We Are All Legends (1981), his tales of legendary madman Tom O'Bedlam, numerous works using H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, many collected in Awaiting Strange Gods: Weird and Lovecraftian Fictions (2015), and a large body of unconnected short stories. Nonfiction Schweitzer is an authority on the history of speculative fiction and has written numerous critical and bibliographical works on both the field in general and such writers as Lord Dunsany, H. P. Lovecraft, and Robert E. Howard. Many of his essays, reviews and author interviews have been collected into book form. He has also edited a number of anthologies and short story collections. Awards Together with his editorial colleagues Schweitzer won the 1992 World Fantasy Award special award in the professional category for Weird Tales. His poem Remembering the Future won the 2006 Asimov's Science Fictions Readers' Award for best poem.

The terms are used in the music industry as a marketing technique. Bands that release their own material on self-published CDs can also be considered unsigned bands. Often unsigned bands primarily exist to perform at concerts. In more recent years, the Internet has helped promote the music of unsigned bands. Artists often post their music as MP3s on websites. In 2016, the Unsigned Music Awards was established in the UK as the first ever televised international awards ceremony to champion artists without the backing of a record label. History and current scene Many unsigned artists used to sell their music and music- related merchandise without the financial support of a record label, while often seeking a recording contract through the recording of demos. Recently, the Internet has helped promote independent artistic material. Artists tend to post their music on websites such as MySpace, and ILike, and sometimes have their music played on podcast shows. In recent times, artists such as Nine Inch Nails and Radiohead, who once had major label record deals, have started to release their music independently. Various musicians remain independent in their beginning of their music career but later on get a record deal and continue as a signed musician. But this concept changed when major artists such as The Eagles and Nine Inch Nails became independent and parted their ways with record labels such as Interscope. Many services are offered to independent musicians by which the artists can retain the copyrights of their songs and also deliver their music to various stores.  Internet promotion  Internet promotion has been the key for some bands for getting popular. Bands like the Arctic Monkeys, Owl City, and solo artists like Lily Allen have gained popularity through Myspace, although the Arctic Monkeys did not even know what MySpace was, and claimed that fans made it for them. Unsigned bands have become more popular with Internet users and have been able to break into the mainstream charts. They are now finding many resources across the Internet to promote, market, and sell their music almost free of charge. Unsigned charts are now being promoted on almost all the underground music sites and has seen many of the domain owners spending large amounts of money on developing these charts to bring bands to them. A number of these are now additionally registered with the official charts. Blog sites have become popular, as they regularly feature reviews or interviews with unsigned artists. Other blog sites have offered helpful guidance and resources for new unsigned artists. Similar to bloggers, music curators including podcasts, DJs, and Youtube channels are all dedicated to finding quality new songs from unsigned artists for online audiences to discover. Record labels Major record company Universal Music entered into a joint venture with Tunecore to distribute albums online on major stores. The record labels which entered into venture are Interscope(Interscope Digital Distribution), Universal Motown (Unimo Digital Distribution), Island Def Jam (IDJ FirstLook) and Universal Republic (Republic Digital Distribution). Island Def Jam Music Group partnered with Tunecore to launch IDJ Firstlook, a new web portal that provides unsigned artists with potential access to such coveted major label services as worldwide distribution and marketing. Independent vanity record labels Artists can also create their own record labels and sell their music under the label's imprint as well. Services such as Nimbit gives facilities for independent musicians to release their music independently as well as under a record label created by the artists themselves. Other efforts made in this field include Magnatune, an independent record label based in Berkeley, California, United States.  Notable unsigned artists  Notable artists who have never been signed to a major record label include Chance the Rapper, macklemore, Noname, David Choi and Ryan Upchurch See also *Independent music References Category:Music industry ","title":"Unsigned artist"},{"id":"4537011","text":"Voice of the Fire is the first novel from Alan Moore, acclaimed comic book writer.

The narratives take place around Moore‚Äôs hometown of Northampton, England, during the month of November, and span several millennia ‚Äì from 4000 B.C. to the present day. The 2004 edition from Top Shelf Productions features an introduction from Neil Gaiman and colour plates by artist Jos√© Villarrubia. A new paperback edition, retaining all of these features, was published by Top Shelf in July 2009. Plot summary The story follows the lives of twelve people who lived in the same area of England over a period of 6000 years, and how their lives link to one another‚Äôs. Each chapter carries the reader forward in time, but circles around the centre of Northampton, drawing in historical events and touchstones, before finally segueing into metafictional narrative in the closing chapter, as the author himself comments directly upon the previous chapter‚Äôs ambiguous closing line, before relating a personal (possibly fictional) anecdote about Northampton which relates a personal experience of local myth, and features an appearance by his daughter and son- in-law, the writers Leah Moore and John Reppion. Throughout, the image of the fire sparks resonates between the tales, while Moore finds a different voice for each character ‚Äì though most are inherently duplicitous in some manner, leading to a further commentary on the disparity between myth and reality, and which is more likely to endure over time.

The units of the 213th Group continually provide support to units and organizations throughout the United States and the world. In 2009, the Group provided abbreviated Reception, Staging, and Onward Integration services for the G-20 Summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, processing over 2,500 troops into the Area of Responsibility. In 2007‚Äì2008 the Group deployed to Balad, Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. During this mission, it served as one of five sustainment brigades assigned to the 316th Expeditionary Sustainment Command headquartered in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania. In 2005, immediately after Hurricane Katrina made landfall, the Group quickly deployed to Metairie, New Orleans in support of Katrina Relief, acting as a command and control for the Intermediate Staging Base at Zephyr Stadium. A tour in Afghanistan from 2003‚Äì2004 found the area support group providing command and control for bases in Bargram, Kandahar, and Kabal, Afghanistan along with an additional command and control cell in Uzbekistan. In 1996 the group provided combat service support to an active- duty brigade during a field training exercise at the Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Polk, Louisiana. In 1997, the group Headquarters Company sent 50 members to Hungary to support the Stabilisation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (S-FOR). Throughout the past decade, Group subordinate units have performed yeoman's work in fighting the War on Terror. During blizzards, floods and civil emergencies, all the units of the Group stand ready to assist the communities and people of the Commonwealth.

The symmetry set, a super-set of the medial axis is the green and yellow curves. One bi-tangent circle is shown. The medial axis of an object is the set of all points having more than one closest point on the object's boundary. Originally referred to as the topological skeleton, it was introduced by BlumA transformation for extracting new descriptors of shape H Blum, Models for the perception of speech and visual form, 1967 as a tool for biological shape recognition. In mathematics the closure of the medial axis is known as the cut locus. In 2D, the medial axis of a subset S which is bounded by planar curve C is the locus of the centers of circles that are tangent to curve C in two or more points, where all such circles are contained in S. (It follows that the medial axis itself is contained in S.) The medial axis of a simple polygon is a tree whose leaves are the vertices of the polygon, and whose edges are either straight segments or arcs of parabolas. The medial axis together with the associated radius function of the maximally inscribed discs is called the medial axis transform (MAT). The medial axis transform is a complete shape descriptor (see also shape analysis), meaning that it can be used to reconstruct the shape of the original domain. The medial axis is a subset of the symmetry set, which is defined similarly, except that it also includes circles not contained in S. (Hence, the symmetry set of S generally extends to infinity, similar to the Voronoi diagram of a point set.) The medial axis generalizes to k-dimensional hypersurfaces by replacing 2D circles with k-dimension hyperspheres. The 2D medial axis is useful for character and object recognition, while the 3D medial axis has applications in surface reconstruction for physical models, and for dimensional reduction of complex models.

Background and role in genocide  Nzuwonemeye was born in Kigali-rural pr√©fecture, Rwanda; he is of Hutu ethnicity. Nzuwonemeye entered the Rwandan Armed Forces, and by 1994 held the rank of major. In 1993, he was commander of the 42nd battalion of FAR; he was subsequently promoted to commander of the Reconnaissance Battalion. The ICTR indictment alleges that between 1990 and 1994, Nzuwonemeye and other officers conspired to exterminate the Tutsi civilians and political opponents, and helped to train interahamwe and militia groups who committed the genocide.Indictment against Nzuwonemeye from the ICTR After Habyarimana's death and the start of the genocide, members of the Reconnaissance Battalion commanded by Nzuwonemeye's subordinate, Innocent Sagahutu, \\"tracked down, arrested, sexually assaulted, and killed\\" Rwandan Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana. They also took into custody ten Belgian peacekeepers from UNAMIR who had been guarding her house. They were taken back to Camp Kigali, a FAR encampment, where they were \\"attacked and beaten\\" by members of RECCE under Sagahutu's command and were later killed. They were accompanied in this by members of the Presidential Guard commanded by Major Protais Mpiranya. During the same operation, the Rwandan Army soldiers took into custody ten Belgian peacekeepers from UNAMIR who had been guarding her house.  After the genocide  Nzuwonemeye fled Rwanda after the RPF victory. In an indictment last amended on 25 September 2002, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) charged Nzuwonemeye with \\"conspiracy to commit genocide, genocide, crimes against humanity, and violations of the Geneva Convention.\\" Nzuwonemeye was arrested in France on 15 February 2000, the same day as his former deputy, Innocent Sagahutu, was arrested in Denmark.

It was established by George Ahwee and Rudy Choy in 1940. History At the beginning of the establishment, Kowloon Dairy Limited was a very small company with approximately 30 employees, only able to supply the fresh milk to the northern part of the Kowloon Peninsula. The company expanded after an owner of a horse, Li Lan Sang joined the company by contributing a lot of funds. In the early years, the Kowloon Dairy Limited's factory was located where the Choi Wan Estate is presently situated. In 1972, the Hong Kong government decided to reclaim the land in order to build public estates for its citizens and Kowloon Dairy decided to move its factory to Tuen Mun and the Farm to Yuen Long. This was certainly a significant move for the company since the farm has been expanded to 21,000 square foot with more than 300 cows. After the company settled, it started the business and automation development. Today, there are between 201 and 500 employees working for the Kowloon Dairy Limited. Its dairy products are sold everywhere in Hong Kong and Macau. The company produces different varieties of dairy products, including milk and ice cream. In 1992, Kowloon Dairy Limited entered the Chinese market and formed a joint company named the Kowloon Dairy (Guangzhou) Limited with local dairy company Fengxing Milk. Production in China started in 1994; now, dairy products from Kowloon Dairy Limited can be found in Guangdong, Hainan, Fujian, Heilongjiang and Yunnan. Quality Today, Kowloon Dairy Limited is very concerned about the quality of their daily products. They have replaced the milking process from hand to machine. This change is to ensure the quality of the milk. Starting from 2010, Kowloon Dairy Limited has purposely added a cover on its glass milk bottles, ensuring good quality and providing nutritional values and ingredients. Award In January 2007 and 2009, Kowloon Dairy Limited was awarded certification from HACCP Food Safety Management and the ISO 22000 Certification by the British Standards Institution. This was the first time a Hong Kong Dairy Product company was recognized and awarded. Furthermore, in September 2011, Kowloon Dairy Limited was granted HACCP Food Safety Management and ISO 22000 Certification from the SGS. Product There are many different varieties of dairy products produced by Kowloon Dairy Limited. There are up to eight types of milk for customers to choose from, such as regular fresh milk, Hi-Calcium Slimilk, Hi-Calcium Skimmed, Gold Medal Milk, Australian Whole Milk, Hi-Calcium Chocolate Slimilk, Deluxe Chocolate Low Fat Milk, and Hi-Fibre Papaya Low Fat Milk. As for ice cream products, there are up to four types of choices such as Mochi Ice, Mini Mochi Ice, Family Pack Ice Cream, and Ovaltine Cone Series. There are more than eight flavors, such as Vanilla, Chocolate, Mango, etc. See also * Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited * List of food companies * Trappist Dairy (Hong Kong) Limited * The Garden Company * Manufacturing in Hong Kong References External links * Kowloon Dairy Category:Drink companies of Hong Kong Category:Dairy products companies of Hong Kong Category:Ice cream brands Category:1940 establishments in Hong Kong Category:Food and drink companies established in 1940 ","title":"Kowloon Dairy"},{"id":"4537144","text":"Woodlouse activity decreases as humidity increases. Kinesis, like a taxis or tropism, is a movement or activity of a cell or an organism in response to a stimulus (such as gas exposure, light intensity or ambient temperature). Unlike taxis, the response to the stimulus provided is non-directional. The animal does not move toward or away from the stimulus but moves at either a slow or fast rate depending on its \\"comfort zone.\\" In this case, a fast movement (non-random) means that the animal is searching for its comfort zone while a slow movement indicates that it has found it. Types There are two main types of kineses, both resulting in aggregations. However, the stimulus does not act to attract or repel individuals. Orthokinesis: in which the speed of movement of the individual is dependent upon the stimulus intensity. For example, the locomotion of woodlice in relation to humidity. With increased humidity there is an increase in the percentage time that the woodlice will remain stationary. Klinokinesis: in which the frequency or rate of turning is proportional to stimulus intensity. For example the behaviour of the flatworm (Dendrocoelum lacteum) which turns more frequently in response to increasing light thus ensuring that it spends more time in dark areas. Basic model of kinesis The kinesis strategy controlled by the locally and instantly evaluated well-being (fitness) can be described in simple words: Animals stay longer in good conditions and leave bad conditions more quickly. If the well- being is measured by the local reproduction coefficient then the minimal reaction-diffusion model of kinesis can be written as follows: A.N. Gorban,N. √áabuko«ßlu, Basic model of purposeful kinesis, Ecological Complexity, Volume 33, January 2018, Pages 75-83. For each population in the biological community, \\\\partial_t u_ i ( x,t) = D_{0i} abla \\\\left(e ^{-\\\\alpha_i r_i(u_1,\\\\ldots,u_k,s)} abla u_i \\\\right)+r_i (u_1,\\\\ldots,u_k,s) u_i, where: u_i is the population density of ith species, s represents the abiotic characteristics of the living conditions (can be multidimensional), r_i is the reproduction coefficient, which depends on all u_i and on s, D_{0i}>0 is the equilibrium diffusion coefficient (defined for equilibrium r_i=0). The coefficient \\\\alpha_i>0 characterises dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the reproduction coefficient. The models of kinesis were tested with typical situations. It was demonstrated that kinesis is beneficial for assimilation of both patches and fluctuations of food distribution. Kinesis may delay invasion and spreading of species with the Allee effect.

Matthew Woll (January 25, 1880 - June 1, 1956) was president of the International Photo-Engravers Union of North America from 1906 to 1929, an American Federation of Labor (AFL) vice president from 1919 to 1955 and an AFL-CIO vice president from 1955 to 1956. Early life Born in Luxembourg in 1880 to Michael and Janette Woll, the Roman Catholic Wolls emigrated to the United States and settled in Chicago, Illinois. Matthew Woll attended public school until the age of 15, then became an apprentice photo- engraver. He entered the Kent College of Law (then part of Lake Forest University) in 1901. He took night courses, graduated and was admitted to the bar in 1904. Early Trade Union Career In 1906, Woll was elected president of the International Photo-Engravers Union of North America (IPEU). During his tenure, IPEU organized more than 90 percent of all photo-engravers in the United States and Canada. A firm believer in arbitration rather than the strike, Woll forced nearly all IPEU locals to agree to binding arbitration clauses in their collective bargaining agreements. Woll also campaigned heavily for the five-day work week, paid vacations and holidays, and health and welfare benefits. By the mid-1920s, IPEU had achieved most of these goals. Woll served as AFL fraternal delegate to the British Trades Union Congress in 1915 and 1916. During World War I, he served on the War Labor Board. AFL career In 1919, Woll was elected to the executive council of the American Federation of Labor. In 1924, when AFL president Samuel Gompers died, Woll was widely expected to take the reins of the organization. But John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers of America, wanted the presidency for himself. But Lewis was unable to muster enough support for his candidacy, and threw his weight behind Mine Worker secretary William Green in the mistaken belief that he could use Green as a puppet to control the AFL. But Green found a kindred anti-communist in Woll, and the two became close. Over time, taking on a number of additional responsibilities‚Äîincluding becoming president of the AFL's union label department; director of the AFL's legal bureau; chairman of the AFL's standing committees on education, social security and international relations‚ÄîWoll resigned as IPEU president in 1929 and became first vice- president of the union. Woll is also noted for being the chief proponent of a union-owned insurance company. Woll believed that the purpose of such a company would be \\"to sell insurance to individual workers without profit, to sell insurance to whole organizations and, thus, weaken the hold of employers on their workers through group insurance.\\" Woll convinced the AFL to provide the start-up money for such an organization. The Union Labor Life Insurance Company (ULLICO) opened its doors on May 1, 1925. Woll was president of the company from 1925 to 1955, and then its general executive chairman from 1955 until his death. In the mid-1920s, Woll became acting president of the National Civic Federation. Woll pushed the federation to collaborate with a broad array of anti-communist organizations. He was forced to step down as acting president after coming under attack by Lewis at the 1935 AFL-CIO convention. In the early 1930s, Woll helped found and then headed up the AFL's National Committee for Modification of the Volstead Act, an organization seeking repeal of Prohibition. Woll published Our Next Step (Harper & Bros.), a treatise on economics, with William English Walling in 1934. The work called for federal policies which would encourage a shift from profits to wages in order to expand consumer purchasing power. In 1935, Woll published Labor, Industry and Government (D. Appleton-Century), a treatise on labor relations. Woll was a strong supporter of craft unionism. During the debates over the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), Woll portrayed himself as a conciliator and mediator, but worked behind the scenes to undercut Mine Workers president John L. Lewis and other proponents of industrial unionism. Increasingly obsessed with international affairs and the Soviet Union, Woll served as an AFL delegate to the International Federation of Trade Unions conference in 1937 and to the International Labour Organization's conference in 1938. Woll believed, as had his mentor and friend, Samuel Gompers, that labor's best hope for survival lay in forging a labor-management entente. Subsequently, Woll advocated free-market positions, including strongly anti- regulatory views. This led Woll to oppose the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which Woll saw as merely more government intervention in the workplace. During World War II, Woll served on the National War Labor Board. After the war, Woll served as a consultant to the United Nations on trade union issues, and was instrumental in working with Eleanor Roosevelt to incorporate language specifically protecting the right to form and/or join a union into Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Woll was elected a vice- president of the AFL-CIO after the two organizations merged in 1955. Matthew Woll died in 1956. Legacy A lifelong Republican, Woll is considered one of the most conservative of all major American labor leaders. For example, at the AFL-CIO convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1935, Woll bitterly denounced the Wagner Act as a betrayal of the legacy of Samuel Gompers. A staunch anti-communist, Woll eventually became a confidant of AFL president Samuel Gompers and other like-minded labor leaders such as William Green of the United Mine Workers of America. Green in particular relied heavily on Woll for advice and policy guidance during his term as president of the AFL. Woll also became a mentor to Jay Lovestone, the one-time Communist who was expelled from the party only to become a rabid Red-baiter and AFL-CIO foreign policy advisor. In 1944, the AFL-CIO established the Free Trade Union Committee (FTUC) to assist free trade unions abroad, particularly in Europe. Lovestone was named its secretary, reporting (in part) to Woll. Lovestone's mission was to eliminate pro-Communist unions and supplant them with unions which supported capitalism. The Central Intelligence Agency funneled millions of dollars through FTUC in support of American foreign policy goals. Woll's influence on Green is difficult to understate. In many ways, Matthew Woll operated as a kind of puppet-master, heavily influencing AFL-CIO policy through his relationship with Green and AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer George Meany. Mild-mannered and courtly, Green strongly believed in an evangelical \\"Christian cooperation\\" worldview similar to the social gospel, in which men of good moral character would do right by one another if only they committed themselves to Christ. Green's views dovetailed with those of Woll, who advocated a cooperative rather than adversarial relationship with management. Green's religious views also led him to adopt a virulently anti-Communist outlook. Woll and Meany, both ardent anti-Communists, found a fellow traveler in Green. They effectively played on Green's Christian idealism and fears of \\"godless Communism\\" to Red-bait leftist leaders and activists throughout the labor movement and seek their ouster.

Working in a small group, teachers collaborate with one another, meeting to discuss learning goals, planning an actual classroom lesson (called a \\"research lesson\\"), observing how their ideas work in a live lessons with students, and then reporting on the results so that other teachers can benefit from it.  Different levels of lesson study  In Japan, lesson study is conducted at the school, district, and national levels. Features common to all three levels are: * preparation of a detailed lesson plan, providing background research information, lesson goals, connections to state or local learning standards, reasoning behind the design of the lesson, and steps of the lesson along with anticipated student responses; * observation of a live lesson conducted with students (the research lesson); and * a discussion following the lesson, analyzing its impact on students and implications for future instruction. School-, district-, or national-level lesson study differ with respect to the students they consider. * School-based lesson study (discussed in more detail below) aims to address a school-wide research theme. * District-level lesson study is often used for schools to share learning with other schools. A school might have an open house, with research lessons held at every grade, which district leaders and educators from other schools will attend. * National-level lesson study is conducted by enthusiastic volunteers who are also very experienced, highly respected teachers. The research lesson is done at a major conference. The objective may be to explore new content or to present a new approach to teaching particular content. National-level research lessons often inform changes in the national Course of Study. Despite differences between Japanese and American educational systems (see Education in Japan and Education in the United States), the practice is gaining in popularity in the United States in K-12 education and teacher training (See Instructional rounds), and more recently it is finding a home in higher education as a form of faculty development. This is a specific example of the ongoing Japanese devotion to the Plan-Do-Check-Act PDCA decision-making discipline pioneered by W. Edwards Deming, which is based upon the Shewhart Cycle (named after Deming's collaborator from Bell Telephone Laboratories, Walter A. Shewhart). School- based lesson study Graphical depiction of school-based lesson study developed by Lesson Study Alliance. The most common form of lesson study in Japan is school-based. In contrast to the other forms of lesson study, school- based lesson study usually involves a sequence of research lessons, extending through one or more academic years, focused on a common teaching/learning issue referred to as the research theme. A research theme may be content- specific ‚Äì e.g. \\"For students to see the connection between science and their everyday lives\\" ‚Äì or cross-curricular ‚Äì e.g. \\"For students to clearly express their ideas and carefully consider the ideas of their friends.\\" Another common objective of school-based lesson study is to address changes in the national Course of Study, which in Japan is revised every 9 years or so. Through multiple research lessons at different grade levels, a school faculty works toward a common vision of how to achieve their goals. Since the goal is not to refine individual lessons, it is not considered a normal part of lesson study to revise and reteach a lesson, although that is done on occasion. The median time for the planning of one research lesson in Japan is more than 5 weeks.

Nut rolls resemble a jelly roll (Swiss roll) but usually with more layers of dough and filling, and resemble strudels but with fewer and less delicate dough layers. Fillings commonly have as their main ingredient ground walnuts or poppy seeds. Nut rolls can be found in the United States and in Central European cuisines. In the United States, \\"nut roll\\" is a more or less generic name for pastries of this type, no matter where they originate. Nut rolls are known also by many specific regional names, including: orechovn√≠k in Slovak; makowiec in Polish; potica, povitica, gibanica, orahnjaƒça/orehnjaƒça in Slovenian, Croatian and Serbian (walnut variant, makovnjaƒça for variant with poppy seed, in Croatia can also be made with carob); kal√°cs and bejgli in Hungarian; and pasti√ß (pastiche) or nokul in Turkish. Regional variations on nut rolls are part of weddings, for Easter and Christmas, as well as other celebrations and holidays. Preparation and design A typical American-style nut roll with a walnut and coffee filling A sweet yeast dough is rolled flat, about 0.2 inches (5 millimeters) thick, and a filling is spread on it. The filled dough is rolled up, forming a log or loaf shape, then baked. When sliced, the cross- section shows a swirl of filling. Types or forms of nut roll are: rolled log, loaf made via a bread pan, and a \\"crazy loaf\\" style with a unique texture.Potica takes Slovenian tradition on a roll Similar ground walnut filling is used in Buchteln, a bun-shaped pastry, also with yeast dough.

These are generally made with either of two types of filling: walnut and poppy seed. In addition to ground nut fillings, cinnamon, raisins or currants, bread crumbs, lemon zest, rum and heavy cream or sour cream are used. The poppyseed versions are still popular in Russian-American neighborhoods in the USA. Povitica The povitica,Recipes from the Iron Range a traditional Croatian and partly Slovenian pastry, is made from buttery pastry dough rolled into very thin layers and covered with a layer of brown sugar, spices, and walnuts. The log- shaped loaf is then baked.Povitica picture Povitica was featured as the technical challenge recipe on the \\"Advanced Dough\\" episode of The Great British Baking Show in 2014.http://www.pbs.org/food/recipes/povitica/ Other roll-shaped European pastries are filled with thick jam (called lekvar, usually apricot or cherry) called lekvarostekercs or Swiss roll. Slovenia Slovenian potica is traditional walnut roll cake in Slovenia.

Serbian nut roll is usually covered with a layer of poppy, walnut or cherry, but sometimes can be with a layer of carob or cocoa. United States Nut rolls are popular across the United States, often made with some combination of walnut, poppy seed, apricot, and coffee,Popular Flavors with more traditional varieties and preparations made in areas with large Central European settlements. They were introduced there by Central European immigrants and widely adopted by other ethnic groups in those regions. Nut rolls are an essential part of Christmas celebrations and popular other times in Pittsburgh and southwestern Pennsylvania, Joliet, Illinois, Pueblo, Colorado, Sheboygan, Wisconsin, Youngstown, Ohio, northeastern Ohio (where it is known as kolachi), the Iron Range of Minnesota, Kansas City and Butte, Montana. As such, povitica, as well as Cornish pasties, are considered one of the traditional state foods of Montana, regardless of ethnic group.

He was the leading Western scholar on Islamic law, whose Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence (1950) is still considered a centrally important work on the subject. The author of many articles in the first and second editions of the Encyclopaedia of Islam, Schacht also co-edited, with C. E. Bosworth, the second edition of The Legacy of Islam for the Legacy series of Oxford University Press and authored a textbook under the title An Introduction to Islamic Law (1964). Life and career Schacht was born into a Catholic family but, with a zeal for study, became at an early age a student in a Hebrew school. In Breslau and Leipzig he studied Semitic languages, Greek, and Latin, under professors including Gotthelf Bergstr√§√üer. In 1924 he published his Habilitations-Schrift, Das kitab al-hiial fil-fiqh (Buch d. Rechtskniffe) des ab≈´ HƒÅtim Mahm≈´d ibn al-Hasan al-Qazuƒ´nƒ´, with translation and commentary. In 1925 he obtained his first academic position at the Albert-Ludwigs- Universit√§t Freiburg in Breisgau. In 1927 he became there a professor extraordinarius, making him the youngest professor in all of Germany, and in 1929 a professor ordinarius of Semitic languages. In 1932 he was appointed a professor at the University of K√∂nigsberg. But in 1934, without being directly threatened or persecuted, Schacht, as a strong opponent of the Nazi regime, went to Cairo, where he taught until 1939 as a professor. At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, he happened to be in England, where he offered his services to the British government and worked for the BBC. In 1947 he became a British citizen. Schacht taught at Oxford University from 1946. In 1954 he moved to the Netherlands and taught at the University of Leiden. In the academic year 1957‚Äì1958, he taught at Columbia University, where, in 1959 he became a full professor of Arabic and Islamic studies. He remained at Columbia until his retirement in 1969 as professor emeritus. One of Schacht's major contributions to the history of early Islam is the recognition that Hadith probably stems from those in whom the different traditions of the past converge, and this convergence Schacht describes as \\"common link\\". This concept was later used productively by many other orientalists.Wakin, Jeanette: Remembering Joseph Schacht (1902‚Äì1969). Islamic Legal Studies Program. Harvard Law School. Occasional Publications 4, January 2003. Thought Theory of Islamic law Schacht argued that Islamic law was not as classical Islamic jurisprudence taught, *the product of an ordered following of four sources/components (which in order of importance/senority were): #the Quran, #the Sunnah (the body of traditional social and legal custom and practice of the Islamic community), #Qiyas (the process of deductive analogy), and #Ijma (the consensus/agreement of Muslim scholars) ; *neither did its chronology follow a direct path of Allah-> Muhammad-> Companions-> Followers-> Fiqh, *nor was fiqh development centered shortly after Muhammad's death in the city (Medina) where he had established his state and where memory and traditions of him were the strongest. Rather the law arose from historical development of three different \\"sunnas\\" ‚Äî bodies of custom, rules and law ‚Äî operating in parallel during the period of the Umayyad Caliphate. #The \\"pre-Islamic sunnah\\" of Arabia, #the mixed custom- administrative law sunnah of the distant provinces\\" of the Umayyads, and later #the \\"living traditions\\" of the newly formed Islamic schools. Unification of Islamic legal thought (so that only one sunnah remained) occurred under the legal scholar Al-Shafi‚Äòi (767-820), when the ahadith of Muhammad became pre- eminent (except for the Quran). The most important of the schools of Islamic law developed in Kufa in Mesopotamia, according to Schacht's research, and its legal precepts spread to other cities such as Medina.J. SCHACHT, The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence (1950), supra note 5, at 228J. SCHACHT, An Introduction to Islamic Law (1964), supra note 5, at 29. Beginning around 100 A.H. (720 CE), ahadith of Muhammad \\"began to be fabricated\\", forming the Islamic Sunnah as it is known today. While scholars recognized that many ahadith were false and attempted to weed these out with  ªilm al-·∏•adƒ´th, this was in vain as most if not all are inauthentic. According to Schacht, with the exception of \\"a few modifications dictated by the Qur'an\\", the Islamic \\"Sunna\\" is the same as the \\"sunna\\" of \\"pre-Mohammed Arabia\\". One example of the power of traditional law was that under the caliphate, theft was punished by flogging, even though the Qur'an had prescribed maiming/amputation.J. Schacht, An Introduction to Islamic Law (1964), supra note 5, at 15. Schacht argues that in part the fabrication of ahadith came from \\"a literary convention, which found particular favor in Iraq\\", whereby authors/scholars would put their \\"own doctrine or work under the aegis of an ancient authority.\\"\\"Pre- Islamic Background and the Early Development of Jurisprudence\\", in 1 Law in the Middle East 28 (M. Khadduri & H. Liebesny eds. 1955), supra note 5, at 43. The ultimate prestigious \\"ancient authority\\" in this context was Muhammad and \\"around 120 A.H.\\" scholars in Kufa, \\"followed in a few years by the Medinese\\" began falsely ascribing \\"their new doctrines back to earlier jurists\\", and over time extended them back to Muhammad.\\"Pre-Islamic Background and the Early Development of Jurisprudence\\", in 1 Law in the Middle East 28 (M. Khadduri & H. Liebesny eds. 1955), supra note 5, at 33. Schacht also blames the religious fervor of those who \\"detested\\" use of Qiyas and Ijma. Providing suspicious justification for the \\"Traditionist\\" fabricators were ahadith such as, \\"sayings attributed to me which agree with the Qur'an go back to me, whether I actually said them or not.\\"Joseph Schacht, \\"Pre-Islamic Background and the Early Development of Jurisprudence\\", in 1 Law in the Middle East 28 (M. Khadduri & H. Liebesny eds. 1955), supra note 5, at 46. Though false, the forgeries could also be justified as recognizing the \\"final legitimacy of what the prophet Muhammad did and said.J. SCHACHT, An Introduction to Islamic Law (1964), supra note 5, at 35-36. Evidence of late creation As evidence that most ahadith were created after 100 A.H., Schacht notes that: #all authentic early writings of Islamic law are virtually devoid of any mention of ahadith of Muhammad;J. SCHACHT, The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence (1950), supra note 5, at 141. #the early doctrines of the schools of law were \\"almost always traced\\" to an earlier jurist or to the Sahabah (\\"companions\\" of Muhammad) but \\"virtually never\\" to Muhammad;J. SCHACHT, An Introduction to Islamic Law (1964), supra note 5, at 32J. SCHACHT, The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence (1950), supra note 5, at 21, 29. #but \\"the best way of proving that a tradition did not exist at a certain time\\" according to Schacht, was \\"to show that it is not used as a legal argument in a discussion which would have made reference to it imperative, if it had existed.\\"J. SCHACHT, The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence (1950), supra note 5, at 140. In reply to the argument that jurists, etc. may not have used a legal argument in a discussion because they had not known about it, Schacht states: ::a. communications in the Islamic empire at that time were good enough for \\"doctrines and views\\" to \\"spread easily and quickly from one juristic center to another\\"; ::b. if the behavior and utterances of Muhammad were the basis of Islamic law from the beginning of Islamic society, it is unlikely those involved in matters of law ‚Äî \\"among the most learned and pious men of Islam\\" ‚Äî would not know them; ::c. there were not dozens but \\"hundreds of examples in which the disparity between an early decision and a later tradition took place\\". According to David F. Forte, \\"it goes beyond rational belief to think that these men would have been so consistently ignorant of contrary actions by the Prophet.\\" The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence (book) As a whole, Origins critiques the methods and standards of ·∏•adƒ´th verification as they were first articulated by Al-Shafi‚Äòi and subsequently developed by his students in the eighth and ninth centuries CE, an early and centrally important stage in the formation of Islamic jurisprudence. His research builds upon the work of important figures in the nineteenth- and twentieth-century study of Islamic law in Europe, such as Gustav Weil and Ign√°c Goldziher. In particular, Schacht advocates a skeptical approach to medieval forms of 'isnƒÅd criticism, which he views as fabricated and comprising the greater part of Sunni approaches to verifying Prophetic traditions of a legal nature.  Argument and Method  Schacht locates the origins of 'ilm al-·∏•adƒ´th in the eighth and ninth centuries CE, a moment in the development of Islamic legal reasoning coinciding with the professionalization of the traditionalist (mu·∏•addith) and jurist (faqƒ´h) classes in the urban centers of the Middle East. Schacht credits ImƒÅm al-ShƒÅfi ªƒ´, the founder of an eponymous school of Islamic jurisprudence, with \\"creating\\" \\"the essentials\\" of the theory of fiqh (the system of Islamic jurisprudence), made up of four principles/sources/components mentioned above: the Qur æƒÅn, the ·∏•adƒ´th of the Prophet Mu·∏•ammad and his Companions, scholarly consensus (ijmƒÅ ø), analogical reasoning (qiyƒÅs).Snouck Hurgronje, C. Verspreide Geschriften. v.ii. 1923-7, page 286-315√âtude sur la th√©orie du droit musulman (Paris : Marchal et Billard, 1892-1898.)Margoliouth, D.S., The Early Development of Mohammedanism, 1914, page 65ffSchacht, Joseph in Encyclopedia of Islam, 1913 v.IV, sv Usul Because the Quran has relatively few verses pertaining to fiqh, Al-Shafi‚Äòi's system meant that \\"the great bulk\\" of the rules of the Islamic law were derived from ahadith. Schacht states that Shafi'i repeatedly insisted that \\"nothing\\" could override the authority of the Prophet, even if it was \\"attested only by an isolated tradition\\", and that if a hadith was \\"well- authenticated\\" (·π¢a·∏•ƒ´·∏•) going back to the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, it had \\"precedence over the opinions of his Companions, their successors, and later authorities\\". Following the work of Goldziher before him, Schacht argues that it was al-ShƒÅfi ªƒ´ who first elevated the sunna and its constituent traditions to great legal prominence. The material importance of the Qur æƒÅn and ·∏•adƒ´th thereafter enjoyed a status comparable to that of juristic consensus, though for al-ShƒÅfi ªƒ´ traditions credibly attributed to the Prophet were to be considered more authoritative than those of his Companions, and indeed could supersede all other sources of legal authority. Moreover, an already-existing legal standard based on such a tradition could be overturned only upon the emergence of a ·∏•adƒ´th that could be more credibly attributable to the Prophet. Al-ShƒÅfi ªƒ´ goes as far as to claim that such well-established traditions invite no debate as to their validity; their truth simply imposes itself upon the human mind, leaving no room for doubt or speculation. Schacht points out, however, that al-ShƒÅfi ªƒ´ inconsistently applies this rule in his own work, alleging that in some cases the jurist favored 'a·∏•ƒÅdƒ´th transmitted from Companions that openly contradicted those attributable to the Prophet. These traditions usually included those which validated ritual practices that were either universally agreed upon or else independently verifiable (such as daily prayer), and those which disputed the legal positions of al-ShƒÅfi ªƒ´'s opponents. Building on this lattermost point, Schacht contends that far from constructing the standards of a legitimate epistemic enterprise al-ShƒÅfi ªƒ´'s science of ·∏•adƒ´th amounts to little more than an uncritical acceptance of Prophetic traditions which justified his own legal preferences. These same traditions, claims Schacht, could not survive a stronger program of investigation. Although the technical evaluation of traditions would continue to evolve across many generations of Muslim scholars, it seems to have largely proceeded along the lines of the deficient form of ‚ÄôisnƒÅd criticism first articulated here by al-ShƒÅfi ªƒ´. Later in Origins Schacht presents evidence which in his estimation suggests that there was in fact a large scale fabrication of Prophetic ‚ÄôisnƒÅds in the generation preceding the life of al- ShƒÅfi ªƒ´'s own teacher, MƒÅlik ibn ‚ÄôAnas (d. 795 CE). Even in MƒÅlik's esteemed golden narrative chain there are suspicious gaps and obvious substitutions, sowing significant doubts as to credibility of the relationships he was said to have had with certain key transmitters. For these reasons modern scholars cannot be nearly as optimistic about the historical-analytic value of ·∏•adƒ´th literature as were their medieval Muslim counterparts.Schacht 163-4. compares the unique matn of al-Muw. i.371 with the same in al-BukhƒÅrƒ´, who has Ab≈´ Hurayra relate the tradition and not ‚ÄòUrwa. At 165-6 Schacht compares al- ShƒÅf‚Äòƒ´ Tr. II with Muw. Al-Shay. 166 and Muw. ii.II. Reception Schacht's views on this matter have come under criticism from scholars in recent decades. His notable critics include M. Mu·π£·π≠afƒÅ al-A ª·∫ìamƒ´ and Wael Hallaq. Al-A'zami's work On Schacht's Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence is a systematic response to Schacht's thesis. Hallaq argues that Schacht mistakenly assumes that medieval Muslims scholars held ·∏•adƒ´th to be apodictically true. According to Hallaq, it is more likely the case ‚Äî and indeed apparent to the careful reader upon inspecting the literature ‚Äî that at least where matters of law were concerned medieval Muslim scholars judged the majority of ·∏•adƒ´th as only probabilistically true. It was the epistemic sum of probable traditions, and not the assured truth of any one tradition in particular, upon which they built their legal rulings. Legacy Scholarly reaction to Schacht's work has produced \\"three camps of scholars\\" according to Mohsen Haredy citing Wael Hallaq. Those (such as John Wansbrough, and Michael Cook) who seek to \\"reconfirm his conclusions\\", and at times going beyond them; those who endeavor to refute them (Nabia Abbott, F. Sezgin, M. Azami, Gregor Schoeler and Johann F√ºck) and a those \\"seeking to create a middle, perhaps synthesized, position between the two\\" (Motzki, D. Santillana, G.H. Juynboll, Fazlur Rahman and James Robson).Wael B. Hallaq, ‚ÄúThe Authenticity of Prophetic Hadith: A Pseudo-problem‚Äù, in Studia Islamica, 89 (1999), p. 76. According to David Forte, \\"nearly all Western Islamic scholars agree that Schacht's evidence against the authenticity of the traditions is virtually unassailable.\\" Some of the supporters of his these include Maurice Gaudefroy-Demombynes, who rights that many ahadith, \\"are apocryphal and were invented in the 8th century in order to justify innovations and tendencies which were very foreign to the intentions of the Prophet.\\"M.

He spent some time in prison in Caxias, and for a long period he was in exile in France. He met some of the intellectuals of the 1950s in Paris, including Albert Camus, who became a friend. He taught at the French universities of Montpellier, Aix and the Sorbonne in Paris. He moved back to Portugal after the return of freedom of expression and democracy in Portugal on April 25, 1974. In 1984 he obtained a PhD in Literature for a thesis on the work of Manuel Teixeira Gomes. In 1993 he retired from the Faculty of Arts of the University of Lisbon as a full professor. Rodrigues wrote for various magazines and newspapers, including the Bulletin des √âtudes Portugaises, Col√≥quio-Letras, Jornal de Letras, V√©rtice and Nouvel Ovservateur. He was director of the review Europa and theater critic for the journals O S√©culo and Di√°rio de Lisboa. He was a co-founder of the Minotauro publishing house with Figueiredo Sobral. This company published the Minotauro magazine. Rodrigues was a member of the Lisbon Academy of Science and the Academy of Brazilian Literature. He received various literary awards including the Pr√©mio Ricardo Malheiros, the prizes of the International Association of Literary Critics and of the Cultural Press, and the grand prize of Conto Camilo Castelo Branco. Urbano Tavares Rodrigues died at the Capuchin Hospital in Lisbon on August 9, 2013.

The neuroepithelial cells span the thickness of the tube's wall, connecting with the pial surface and with the ventricular or lumenal surface. They are joined at the lumen of the tube by junctional complexes, where they form a pseudostratified layer of epithelium called neuroepithelium. Neuroepithelial cells are the stem cells of the central nervous system, known as neural stem cells, and generate the intermediate progenitor cells known as radial glial cells, that differentiate into neurons and glia in the process of neurogenesis. Embryonic neural development Brain development Development of the neural tube During the third week of embryonic growth the brain begins to develop in the early fetus in a process called morphogenesis. Neuroepithelial cells of the ectoderm begin multiplying rapidly and fold in forming the neural plate, which invaginates during the fourth week of embryonic growth and forms the neural tube. The formation of the neural tube polarizes the neuroepithelial cells by orienting the apical side of the cell to face inward, which later becomes the ventricular zone, and the basal side is oriented outward, which contacts the pial, or outer surface of the developing brain. As part of this polarity, neuroepithelial cells express prominin-1 in the apical plasma membrane as well as tight junctions to maintain the cell polarity. Integrin alpha 6 anchors the neuroepithelial cells to the basal lamina. The neural tube begins as a single layer of pseudostratified epithelial cells, but rapid proliferation of neuroepithelial cells creates additional layers and eventually three distinct regions of growth. As these additional layers form the apical-basal polarity must be downregulated. Further proliferation of the cells in these regions gives rise to three distinct areas of the brain: the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. The neural tube also gives rise to the spinal cord. Neuroepithelial cell proliferation Neuroepithelial cells symmetrically divide or differentiate into progenitor cells called radial glial cells in asymmetric cell division. These can further differentiate into neurons or glial cells. Neuroepithelial cells are a class of stem cell and have the ability to self-renew. During the formation of the neural tube, neuroepithelial cells undergo symmetric proliferative divisions that give rise to two new neuroepithelial cells. At a later stage of brain development, neuroepithelial cells begin to self renew and give rise to non-stem cell progenitors, such as radial glial cells simultaneously by undergoing asymmetric division. Expression of Tis21, an antiproliferative gene, causes the neuroepithelial cell to make the switch from proliferative division to neuronic division. Many of the neuroepithelial cells also divide into radial glial cells, a similar, but more fate restricted cell. Being a more fate restricted cell the radial glial cell will either generate postmitotic neurons, intermediate progenitor cells, or astrocytes in gliogenesis. During neuroepithelial cell division, interkinetic nuclear migration allows the cells to divide unrestricted while maintaining a dense packing. During G1 the cell nucleus migrates to the basal side of the cell and remains there for S phase and migrates to the apical side for G2 phase. This migration requires the help of microtubules and actin filaments. Radial glial cell transition Neuroepithelial cells give rise to radial glial progenitor cells in early embryonic development. To make this change, neuroepithelial cells begin to downregulate their epithelial features, by stopping the expression of occludin, a tight junction protein. Loss of occludin causes a loss of the previous tight junction seals which is required for the generation of neuroblasts. Another tight junction protein, PARD3, remains at the apical side of the cell co-localizing with N-cadherin and keeps the apical face of the neuroepithelial cell intact. In the absence of occludin some polarity is still lost and the neuroepithelial cell gives rise to the radial glial cell. Adult neurogenesis Genesis of neuroepithelial cells in the adult CNS Moving away from the ependymal layer of the SVZ the neural cells become more and more differentiatedIn the adult CNS, neuroepithelial cells arise in several different areas of the brain: the subventricular zone (SVZ), the olfactory bulb and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. These cells do not appear in any of the peripheral nervous system. Often categorized as neural stem cells, neuroepithelial cells give rise to only a few varieties of neural cells, making them multipotent - a definite distinction from the pluripotent stem cells found in embryonic development. Neuroepithelial cells undergo mitosis generating more neuroepithelial cells, radial glial cells or progenitor cells, the latter two differentiating into either neurons or glial cells. The neuroepithelial cells undergo two different forms of mitosis: asymmetric differentiating division and symmetric prolific division. The asymmetric cell division results in two different varieties of daughter cells (i.e. a neuroepithelial cell divides into a radial glial cell and another neuroepithelial cell), while the symmetric version yields identical daughter cells. This effect is caused by the orientation of the mitotic spindle, which is located in either the posterior or anterior area of the mitotic cell, rather than the center where it is found during symmetric division. The progenitor cells and radial glial cells respond to extracellular trophic factors - like ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cytokines or neuregulin 1 (NRG1) - that can determine whether the cells will differentiate into either neurons or glia. On a whole, neurogenesis is regulated both by many varied regulatory pathways in the CNS as well as several other factors, from genes to external stimuli such as the individual behavior of a person. The large interconnected web of regulatory responses acts to fine-tune the responses provided by newly formed neurons. Neurogenesis in neural repair Neurogenesis in the adult brain is often associated with diseases that deteriorate the CNS, like Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. While adult neurogenesis is up-regulated in the hippocampus in patients with these diseases, whether its effects are regenerative or inconclusive remains to be seen. Individuals with these diseases also often express diminished olfactory abilities as well as decreased cognitive activity in the hippocampus, areas specific to neurogenesis. The genes associated with these diseases like Œ±-synuclein, presenilin 1, MAPT (microtubule associated protein tau) and huntingtin are also often associated with plasticity in the brain and its modification. Neuroplasticity is associated with neurogenesis in a complementary fashion. The new neurons generated by the neuroepithelial cells, progenitors and radial glial cells will not survive unless they are able to integrate into the system by making connections with new neighbors. This also leads to many controversial concepts, like neurogenic therapy involving the transplant of local progenitor cells to a damaged area. Associated diseases Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT) Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor A dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor is a rare, benign tumor that affects children and teenagers under the age of twenty. The tumor occurs in the tissue covering the brain and spinal cord. The symptoms of the tumor are dependent on its location, but most children experience seizures that cannot be controlled by medication. DNT is usually treated through invasive surgery and the patients are usually capable of recovering fully, with little to no long-term effects. Neuroepithelial cysts Neuroepithelial cysts, also known as colloid cysts, develop in individuals between the ages of 20 and 50 and is relatively rare in individuals under the age of twenty. The cysts are benign tumors that usually appear in the anterior third ventricle. The cysts occur in the epithelium putting their patients at risk for obstructive hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, and rarely intracystic hemorrhage. This results from the cysts enlarging by causing the epithelium to secrete additional mucinous fluid. The cysts are usually found incidentally or if patients become symptomatic presenting with the symptoms of hydrocephalus. The larger cysts are operated on while smaller cysts that are not obstructive can be left alone. Oligodendroglial tumors Oligodendroglial tumors manifest in glial cells, which are responsible for supporting and protecting nerve cells in the brain. The tumor develops over oligodendrocytes and is usually found in the cerebrum around the frontal or temporal lobes. The tumors can either grow slowly in a well- differentiated manner delaying the onset of symptoms, or they can grow rapidly to form an anaplastic oligodendroglioma. The symptoms for this type of tumor include headaches and visual problems. Additionally, blockage of ventricles could cause buildup of cerebral spinal fluid resulting in swelling around the tumor. The location of the tumor may also affect the symptoms since frontal lobe tumors can cause gradual mood or personality changes while temporal lobe tumors result in coordination and speech problems. Ongoing research Neural chimeras Researchers have been able to create neural chimeras by combining neurons that developed from embryonic stem cells with glial cells that were also derived from embryonic stem cells. These neural chimeras give researchers a comprehensive way of studying the molecular mechanisms behind cell repair and regeneration via neuroepithelial precursor cells and will hopefully shed light on possible nervous system repair in a clinical setting. In an attempt to identify the key features that differentiate neuroepithelial cells from their progenitor cells, researchers identified an intermediate filament that was expressed by 98% of the neuroepithelial cells of the neural tube, but none of their progenitor cells. After this discovery it became clear that all three cell types in the nervous system resulted from a homogenous population of stem cells. In order make clinical neural repair possible researchers needed to further characterize regional determination of stem cells during brain development by determining what factors commit a precursor to becoming one or the other. While the exact factors that lead to differentiation are unknown, researchers have taken advantage of human-rat neural chimeras to explore the development of human neurons and glial cells in an animal model. These neural chimeras have permitted researchers to look at neurological diseases in an animal model where traumatic and reactive changes can be controlled. Eventually researchers hope to be able to use the information taken from these neural chimera experiments to repair regions of the brain affected by central nervous system disorders. The problem of delivery, however, has still not been resolved as neural chimeras have been shown to circulate throughout the ventricles and incorporate into all parts of the CNS. By finding environmental cues of differentiation, neuroepithelial precursor transplantation could be used in the treatment of many diseases including multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Further exploration of neural chimera cells and chimeric brains will provide evidence for manipulating the correct genes and increasing the efficacy of neural transplant repair. Depression Research on depression indicates that one of the major causal factors of depression, stress, also influences neurogenesis. This connection led researches to postulate that depression could be the result of changes in levels of neurogenesis in the adult brain, specifically in the dentate gyrus. Studies indicate that stress affects neurogenesis by increasing Glucocorticoids and decreasing neurotransmitters such as serotonin. These effects were further verified by inducing stress in lab animals, which resulted in decreased levels of neurogenesis. Additionally, modern therapies that treat depression also promote neurogenesis. Ongoing research is looking to further verify this connection and define the mechanism by which it occurs. This could potentially lead to a better understanding of the development of depression as well as future methods of treatment.

He is best known as the former lead singer and songwriter of S√£o Paulo-based heavy metal band Angra. With Angra, Falaschi recorded four albums (Rebirth, Temple of Shadows, Aurora Consurgens, and Aqua). He is also noted for his solo band Almah, which started as a side project featuring a number of guest musicians and is now his main and only band.  Early life and first musical experiences  When he was one year old, Falaschi's parents moved to Rio de Janeiro, where he lived until the age of 12. His mother decided to move back to S√£o Paulo, and then S√£o Vicente, influenced by factors including the death of Falaschi's father. Falaschi's first experience with music began as a child. Some of his relatives were non- professional musicians, and he used to sing with his father and uncles during family meetings. By the time he was 14 years old, he was taking guitar lessons, and his interest in music increased. Although he was strongly influenced by the singers Ronnie James Dio and Bruce Dickinson, Falaschi decided to play instrumental songs instead. He played the drums for six months in a blues band with his friends, and he also played bass and guitar and sang backing vocals in a cover band. In 1989, he was invited by school friends to join a band as a singer to play at a music contest. They recorded a demo tape and played for 5,000 people. Subsequently, in 1990, some of the band members decided to form Mitrium, a rock band, in which they played their own compositions.  Career with Mitrium  Mitrium began Falaschi's professional career as vocalist and composer. In 1991, they recorded their first demo tape with the song \\"Just Remember\\". Afterwards, they recorded the second demo with the songs \\"The Shadows\\" and \\"You Can Choose The Side of Darkness\\", both written by Falaschi. The band grew quickly in S√£o Vicente, so they decided to look for opportunities in S√£o Paulo, where they signed a record deal with a record company which released a split-LP called Eyes of Time with four tracks: \\"Eyes of Time\\", \\"Run From the Fire\\", \\"Lives So Close\\" and \\"The Shadows\\", all of them written by Falaschi. In 1994, the heavy metal band Iron Maiden was looking for a new singer through an international contest sponsored by the band, resulting in thousands of tapes being sent in by would-be rock stars. With the increasing recognition of Mitrium, Falaschi had the chance of taking part in the contest. Unexpectedly, he was one of the selected singers from Brazil (along with Andre Matos, then vocalist of Angra) and later from all around the world, getting in contact with Dick Bell, production director of Iron Maiden Holding LTD. In the end, the band did not pick Falaschi. In spite of the professional career success, on August 5, 1994 Falaschi was forced to leave Mitrium due to personal problems, but he kept playing just for fun with his friends, and later recorded a demo, with eight simple rock n' roll songs with a band called Opium.  Career with Symbols, Angra and Almah  Falaschi decided to take a break for almost four years. In the middle of 1998, he was invited by the band Symbols to produce their first album. The leader of the band was Tito Falaschi, his brother. Falaschi ended up producing the album and also being a member of the band. While their first album self-titled Symbols was being released, he was invited to perform in the album Ordinary Existence by Venus. In 2000, Symbols released their second album, called Call to the End. The Brazilian band Angra was looking for new members, and after a trial among other vocalists, Falaschi was invited to join the band in 2000. As in 2012, Falaschi left Angra due to health issues and problems within the band. In 2006, under the project name Almah, he released his first solo album, self- titled. In 2008, as a full band, Almah released their second album, Fragile Equality.  Health-voice problems and treatment Falaschi performed poorly at Rock in Rio 2011, after which he started his treatment.

Known as the Wilbur Cross Highway, it has also been signed as Massachusetts Route 15 between 1948 and 1980 as well as Interstate 86 between 1971 and 1984. History Origins The highway originated as Route 15, an extension of Connecticut Route 15 (then known as the Wilbur Cross Highway). The extension started in Holland, and within , it entered Sturbridge as Mashapaug Road. It then followed Haynes Road to Sturbridge Center ending at Route 131.1946 topographic map sections:  * Upgrade to Interstate Highway Between 1949 and 1952, the Massachusetts Department of Public Works (MassDPW) initiated construction of the Wilbur Cross Highway extension to US 20 in Sturbridge, with two lanes in each direction separated by a wide median and frequent U-turns.1952 topographic map sections:  * Between 1955 and 1957, an extension was created to connect Route 15 to the new Massachusetts Turnpike, which opened on May 15, 1957. In 1958, I-84 was co-signed with Route 15 north and east of East Hartford, Connecticut, into Massachusetts. In late 1968, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) approved a new Interstate connection from Hartford to Providence, which was to become part of a rerouted I-84. As a result, the existing section of I-84 from Manchester, Connecticut, to I-90 (overlapping Route 15) was redesignated I-86. Shortly thereafter, MassDPW embarked on a reconstruction of its portion of the highway with new and reconstructed carriageways providing three lanes and standard shoulders. Both carriageways were separated by a wide, forested variable median. New bridges, interchanges and weigh stations were erected along the route. The $20 million reconstruction project was completed in 1973. (Similar improvements in Connecticut were not completed until the 1980s.) On October 1, 1980, the Connecticut Department of Transportation decided to truncate Route 15 back to I-84 exit 57 (where it ends today), eliminating the overlap with I-86. Simultaneously, Massachusetts eliminated the overlap by decommissioning its Route 15 entirely. Redesignation When the planned portion of I-84 toward Providence ran into opposition in Rhode Island and was cancelled in 1983, I-86 was officially reverted to I-84. The I-86 numbering was officially deleted on December 12, 1984. Plans to connect I-84 along the present day I-384/US 6 corridor from Hartford to Providence were scuttled for environmental reasons. As a result, I-84 was rerouted back onto the completed I-86 freeway. Exit list MassDOT planned to convert I-84, along with the rest of the state's interstates, into the usage of milepost-based exits during 2016, however this project was indefinitely postponed until November 18, 2019, when MassDOT confirmed that beginning in late summer 2020 the exit renumbering project will begin.

First proposed by the French theorist Comte de Guibert, the Mixed Order could be adapted to be used by companies or battalions and involved two or more of these units using a combination of Line and Column formations. Its origins were in the revolutionary wars where the massed French militias lacked the training and experience to complete complicated manoeuvres and by necessity adopted a mixed order of veteran trained units and newly recruited/conscripted units. The regular troops moving in line along with the recruits moving in column, which required far less training to perfect, either on the flanks, the centre or in the rear of the veteran units. The column formation allowed the unit rapid movement, a very effective charge (due to weight of numbers) or it could quickly form an infantry square to resist cavalry attacks, but by its nature only a fraction of its muskets would be able to open fire. The line offered a substantially larger musket frontage allowing for greater shooting capability but required extensive training to allow the unit to move over ground as one while retaining the line. The mixed order remained a part of French tactical doctrine as the French army grew in discipline, capitalising as it did on the strengths of both the line and column formations, while avoiding some of their inherent weaknesses. It was used extensively by Napoleon when commanding the Grande Arm√©e.

The facility was established at Andrews Air Force Base in 1958. As part of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) programme, it merged with Andrews Air Force Base in 2009, to create Joint Base Andrews-Naval Air Facility Washington. History Establishment In 1958 when airspace around Naval Air Station Anacostia in Washington, D.C became too crowded and Anacostia's runways were deemed too short, the naval air activities were moved to Andrews Air Force Base to facilitate jet operations with a detachment of T-2V SeaStar jet trainers. An A-4 Skyhawk became the last jet aircraft to fly out of NAS Anacostia on 25 January 1962 with the transfer to Andrews AFB being complete in December 1961. Captain Frank D. Heyer transferred his command from Anacostia to Andrews, concurrent with the commissioning of the new Naval Air Facility (NAF), Washington D.C. Cold War US Navy C-131F Samaritan from VR-1 Star Lifters in flight during 1965, whilst based at NAF Washington. Throughout the 1960s and into the early 1970s, Navy and Marine Reservists flew the AD-5 Skyraider, FJ-4B Fury, F-8U Crusader, RF-8G Photo Crusader, C-54 Skymaster and C-118 cargo aircraft, SP-2 Neptune aircraft and a variety of others. Tenant squadrons to the NAF at that time included VR-661/662, VF-661/662, VP-661/662/663, and VS-661/662. Prior to 1970, NAF Washington was custodian to all aircraft at the facility. This 'aircraft custodian' practice, common throughout the Naval Air Reserve, required tenant squadrons to \\"rent\\" the aircraft from the NAF on their respective drill weekends. Maintenance and flying responsibilities of NAF aircraft were shared by all Reserve squadrons (including Marine units). In April 1972, the Naval Air Reserve was reorganized into two tactical carrier wings (CVW-20 and CVW-30) with supporting transport and patrol squadrons. With this reorganization, squadrons became custodians of their own aircraft and the NAF was assigned aircraft for utility and training purposes with their primary mission of training Selected Reservists. NAF became home to VFP-206, VFP-306, VR-52, VP-68 and 20 other tactical and non- tactical units. From 1976, the logistics support mission of NAF Washington included administrative transport flight operations and transient service support of arriving aircraft. On 1 May 1978, NAF Washington was transferred to Commander, Navy Reserve Force. It accepted its first UC-12B on 25 July 25 1981. In 1989, the Secretary of the Navy signed a new 25 year permit granting NAF Washington continued use of land on Andrews AFB. In 1991, for the first time since the Vietnam War, NAF Reservists were recalled to active duty in support of the Gulf War. Post-Cold War US Navy Lockheed P-3C of VP-68 Blackhawks, taxing at NAF Washington during 1994. At the start of 1993, NAF Washington D.C. Air Reservists continued to support naval activities with VMFA-321 flying the F/A-18 Hornet, VP-68 flying the P-3C Orion, VAQ-209 flying the EA-6B Prowler, Fleet Logistic Support Wing Detachment flying the C-20 Gulfstream and T-39 Sabreliner, VR-53 flying the C-130 Hercules and the NAF flying the UC-12B for the transportation of VIPs and light cargo. By October 2006, Navy Operational Support Center (NOSC) Anacostia merged with NAF Washington. With this merger, NAF assumed the additional title of Naval District Washington Reserve Component Command. In September 2007, NOSC Adelphi in Maryland was disestablished and was merged with the reserve center at NAF Washington, creating the largest NOSC in the country. Merger As part of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) programme, it was recommended that Naval Air Facility Washington and Andrews Air Force Base, became a joint base known as Joint Base Andrews-Naval Air Facility Washington, or Joint Base Andrews for short. The merger was effective from 1 October 2009, when the joint base was established, with the US Air Force being the lead organization providing management and support services for both installations. Although sharing parallel runways, NAF Washington was originally considered a separate air installation and maintained a separate Navy/Marine Corps‚Äìunique FAA airfield identifier of NSF and an ICAO airfield identifier of KNSF. Prior to merging, these separate airfield identifiers were discontinued on 29 March 2009 and all flight operations in and out of NAF Washington now use the Andrews AFB airfield identifiers of ADW and KADW as appropriate. Joint Base Andrews US Navy C-37B Gulfstream of the type operated by VR-1, based at Joint Base Andrews. Naval Air Facility Washington (NAFW) maintains a Joint Partnership as the supported component of Joint Base Andrews-NAF Washington. As a result of BRACs between 1988 and 2015 that closed seven other Navy Reserve (formerly Naval Reserve)-controlled naval air stations and naval air facilities across the United States, NAF Washington is one of only three remaining Navy Reserve air installations in the United States. It is subordinate to Commander Naval Air Force Reserve head-quartered in San Diego, CA. Its mission is training and readiness support for twelve Navy and US Marine Corps commands aboard NAF Washington in order to deploy forces globally. Effective from 1 June 2014, whilst still remaining part of Joint Base Andrews, NAF Washington was realigned to report to the Commander Naval Air Force Reserve (CNAFR), and NOSC Washington was established to report to Region Mid-Atlantic, Reserve Component Command (RCC).

Heylen was best known known for the television serial A Country Practice, as publican Vernon \\"Cookie\\" Locke, he often performed in a traditional vaudeville style in the vein of Roy Rene, and also sang and played banjo and ukulele. He went into vaudeville after World War II and in 1956 starred in the variety show \\"The Show of Stars\\" with Hal Lashwood and John Ewart. Heylen became well known during the 1960s on television as a regular performer on the HSV-7 variety show Sunnyside Up for 10 years, appearing as \\"Sydney from Sydney\\". He teamed up with other comics, such as Honest John Gilbert, presenting comedy sketches in between the musical items. Early life Heylen was born in Renmark, South Australia as the only son of a carpenter. He joined the army at 16 and served on the Kokoda Trail in the 39th Infantry Battalion, later going on to join an army entertainment troupe. In 1961, he married Patti Brittain (his second wife) and they had two children (both in the entertainment industry) - a daughter, Julie Heylen, and a son, Syd Heylen Junior, who is a well known entertainer in variety and cabaret.

He was cast as Cookie on A Country Practice after the series creator and executive producer James Davern saw him in the ill-fated TV series Arcade in 1980 alongside Lorrae Desmond, whom he would also cast in ACP. Heylen was written out of the series in 1992 alongside another older cast member Gordon Piper (who played Cookie's mate Bob Hatfield) as the producers wanted to concentrate on a younger cast and an updated formula. Davern would later regret dropping Cookie and Bob, as they were two of the show's central long standing older characters who provided many of the comedy scenes between the more dramatic storylines. Previously Heylen had acted in the soap opera The Box playing a fast-talking television sportscaster. Heylen played a minor role in the film Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior as Curmudgeon.Mad Max 2 (1981) ‚Äì Full cast and crew In the 1980s he released a number of albums containing songs such as \\"Who's Sorry Now?\\" (to which the D-Generation quipped \\"anyone who bought the album\\".)

The Yugorsky Strait is on its northwestern end. The Yugorsky Strait or Yugor Strait (, or Yugorsky Shar) is a narrow sound between the Kara Sea and the Pechora Sea. Its maximum width is 10 km and its minimum width only 3 km. Ostrov Storozhevoy, an island 1.6 km in length, lies in the middle of the strait. This sound separates Vaygach Island from the Yugorsky Peninsula on the Russian mainland. History The earliest recorded voyage through the Yugorsky Shar, traditionally known as the Arctic \\"Iron Gateway\\", into the Kara Sea was made from Nizhny Novgorod by early Russian explorer Uleb in 1032. Russian \\"Pomors\\", the coastal dwellers of the White Sea shores, had been exploring this strait since the 11th century. The Arctic's first shipping line, the Great Mangazea Route, from the White Sea to the Ob River and the Yenisei Gulf began operating in the latter part of the 16th century. This line opened up the way to Siberia's riches and worked until 1619, when it was closed for military and political reasons, for fear of possible penetration by Europeans into Siberia. The Yugorsky Strait was an important waterway in the early exploration of the Northern Sea Route and for the traffic of Soviet maritime convoys during World War II.

History The Paramount newsreel operation began in 1927 with Emanuel Cohen as an editor. It typically distributed two issues per week to theaters across the country until its closing in 1957. In the early days, Paramount News footage was silent and filmed with Debrie Parvo cameras branded with the unique Paramount logo and slogan \\"The Eyes of the World\\". It is estimated that about 15 of those cameras were bought by Paramount, but only a few survive today; one can be seen at Paramount Studios. Paramount newsreels typically ran from seven to nine minutes, with the average story running from 40 to 90 seconds. At first, when the newsreels were silent, narration was presented via title cards. By 1930, sound had been introduced and voiceover talent (see below) had been hired to provide the narration. When the news warranted, the entire issue was devoted to one major story, such as the bombing of Pearl Harbor (1941), the historic inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt's third term as President (1941), the presentation of a Mid-Century Sports Poll (1950) in which sports figures such as Jim Thorpe, Babe Ruth, Jesse Owens, Jack Dempsey, and Babe Didrikson (among others) were highlighted, or a recap of the All-American college football team of the previous year. A typical issue began with a \\"hard\\" news item and wound its way down to \\"softer\\" news items as it progressed, usually ending with a recap of recent sports events. Paramount cameramen shot some rare exclusive footage, putting Paramount News near the forefront of the competition with other newsreel operations such as Path√© News (1910-1956), Fox Movietone News (1928-1963), Hearst Metrotone News (1914-1967), Universal Newsreel (1929-1967), and The March of Time (1935-1951). One Paramount News exclusive was the 1937 Republic Steel strike in Chicago. On Memorial Day, May 26, 1937, the strike escalated into a massacre,Memorial Day Massacre of 1937 at the Illinois Labor History Society documented by the 1937 film Republic Steel Strike Riot Newsreel Footage. Highlights of Paramount News include basketball player Wilt Chamberlain being introduced to the sports world at the age of seventeen, playing high school basketball, and countless special coverage pieces about Paramount movie premieres and stars, including Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Martin and Lewis, Jerry Lewis solo, and Frank Sinatra at New York's Paramount Theater in 1944 with throngs of bobby soxers swooning. However, footage of W. C. Fields on a Paramount set filming International House when the 1933 Long Beach earthquake struck was later revealed to have been faked by that film's crew for publicity purposes. Paramount mogul Adolph Zukor \\"presented\\" (produced) Paramount News and appeared in many of its newsreels throughout the years. The Paramount News slogan was \\"The Eyes and Ears of the World\\" (\\"The Eyes of the World\\" in its early silent days) and was included in its well-known closing, which featured a cameraman turning a large 35 mm movie camera toward the audience. This was accompanied by a music theme titled \\"Paramount On Parade\\", composed by Elsie Janis. Voiceover talent Voiceover talent included Gregory Abbott (1900‚Äì1981), lead voice for the presentation of news and the only narrator to stay until the series ended in 1957. Bill Slater was a narrator for many years. Other narrators included Gabriel Heatter (who introduced the voiceover talent in a special issue release of Paramount News in the early 1930s, Gregory Abbott being among those introduced), Vincent Connoly, Maurice Joyce, Dennis James (later a TV game show and variety show host), Gilbert Martyn, and Frank Gallop among others. The sports segments were narrated by Bill Slater in the early years and from 1948 to the end of the Paramount News run in 1957 by ex-athlete and football player Marty Glickman, who later became known as the voice of New York sports and was renowned in sports broadcasting. Other broadcasters such as Johnny Most, Don Dunphy and Jackson Beck lent a hand doing sports voiceovers for a few Paramount News releases; Beck also did a few \\"hard news\\" stories as well. Gregory Abbott, Gilbert Martyn, and Maurice Joyce also handled some sports stories. Awards Paramount News Issue #37 (1946) was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short.

The star C is the most massive of the four bright stars at the heart of the cluster. It is an O class blue main sequence star with a B-type main sequence companion. Its high luminosity and large distance (about 1,500 light years) give it an apparent visible magnitude of 5.1.

Theta2 Orionis is a more distant grouping of three main stars plus several fainter companions, 1-2 arc-minutes from Theta1. Theta1 C is itself a binary of two massive stars, C1 () and C2, plus a very close fainter companion apparently escaping the system. Theta1 Orionis C1 is responsible for generating most of the ultraviolet light that is slowly ionizing (and perhaps photoevaporating) the Orion Nebula.

In 1871 the Rugby Football Union, the governing body for rugby union in England, was formed by 21 rugby clubs, and the first international match, which involved England, was played in Scotland. The English national team compete annually in the Six Nations Championship, and are former world champions after winning the 2003 Rugby World Cup. The top domestic men's club competition is Premiership Rugby, and English clubs also compete in international competitions such as the European Rugby Champions Cup. The top domestic women's competition is the Premier 15s. History Rugby School and foundation of early clubs Rugby School Rugby in England is generally attributed to when William Webb Ellis \\"who with a fine disregard for the rules as played in his time, first took the ball in his arms and ran with it\\" in 1823 at the Rugby School, although modern scholars consider this story to be a myth. One of the earliest football clubs formed, some claim it to actually be the first, is the Guy's Hospital Football Club which was founded in 1843 in Guy's Hospital, Southwark, London. The club played an early version of rugby football and was formed by old boys of the Rugby School. Subsequent clubs established in this period include Dublin University Football Club in 1854 and the Blackheath Rugby Club in 1858. The forming of the RFU The Football Association was formed at the Freemasons' Tavern, Great Queen Street, on Lincoln's Inn Fields, London on 26 October 1863, with the intention to include the most acceptable points of play under the one heading of football. However, disagreements over what was being excluded led the Blackheath Club to withdraw from the association which was followed by a number of other clubs. In 1870, Richmond F.C. published an invitation in the newspapers which read \\"Those who play the rugby-type game should meet to form a code of practice as various clubs play to rules which differ from others, which makes the game difficult to play\\". In January of the following year, 21 clubs meet at the Pall Mall Restaurant and the Rugby Football Union (RFU) was founded. First international and the schism in rugby The Last Scrimmage by Edwin Buckman depicting a rugby scrum, as published on The Illustrated London News in 1871 On 27 March 1871 the first ever international match took place, involving the English rugby team and the Scottish. Scotland won the match, which was played at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh. In 1884, England opted not to join the International Rugby Football Board which was formed by Ireland, Scotland and Wales, as they thought they should have greater representation on the board as they have the larger number of clubs. By the late 19th century, the issue over broken time in rugby had become important, particularly in the North of England, where a larger working class played rugby compared to the south, thus their work and injuries they received whilst playing came into conflict with the rules of amateurism. With mounting pressure regarding player payments and veiled professionalism, on 29 August 1895 at a meeting at the George Hotel, Huddersfield, 21 clubs met to form the Northern Rugby Football Union and thus resigned from the RFU. The game of rugby league was formed from the disaffected clubs. During this period, rugby was played between counties similar to the system of first-class cricket in England now. In 1907, Cornwall won the county tournament and went on to represent Britain at Rugby union at the 1908 Summer Olympics. Twickenham and centenary celebrations The 1910 opening of the RFU's new home at Twickenham heralded a golden era for English rugby union. During the First World War, the Four Nations Championship became suspended in 1915 and it was not resumed until 1920. One hundred and thirty three international players were killed during the conflict. In 1923, a century of rugby was celebrated at the Rugby School, which saw an England and Wales XV play a Scottish-Irish team. World War II For duration of World War II the ban on rugby league players was temporarily lifted by the RFU. Many played in the eight rugby \\"Internationals\\" between England and Scotland which were played by Armed Services teams. The authorities also allowed the playing of two \\"Rugby League vs. Rugby Union\\" fixtures as fundraisers for the war effort (both matches were won by the rugby league teams playing rugby union). In 1958, long after the William Webb Ellis had become engraved as a legend in the history of rugby union, his grave was finally located by Ross McWhirter in the French town of Menton near the border with Monaco. Formation of leagues The RFU had long resisted leagues competitions, as it was thought that they would encourage player payments, thus most club matches were only organised friendlies, with competitions such as the County Cups and County Championship existing also. In 1972 the RFU sanctioned a knock-out competition, which was revamped in 2005 into a competition for top-tier English and Welsh sides now known as the LV= Cup. The league evolved over time since starting in 1987 when the Courage Leagues were formed, a league pyramid that had more than 1000 clubs playing in 108 leagues; each with promotion and relegation. Professionalism England celebrating their World Cup win in 2003 The Heineken Cup was formed in 1995 as a competition for twelve European clubs and ran through to the 2013‚Äì14 season, after which it was replaced by the European Rugby Champions Cup. Both competitions involve sides from England, France, Wales, Ireland, Scotland and Italy. The century-old competition for the European rugby powers became the Six Nations Championship in 2000 with the addition of Italy. In November 2008 a proposal was made and adopted by the RFU to create a fully professional second tier of club rugby, to be called the Championship. It replaced National Division One starting with the 2009‚Äì10 season.http://www.rfu.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/RFUHome.News_Detail/StoryID/21277 Governing body The Rugby Football Union are the governing body for rugby union in England. Competitions  Premiership The 12-team Premiership is the top level of competition; it is fully professional, but has a salary cap in place. The RFU Championship (formerly National Division One) and National League 1 (formerly National Division Two) are the next rungs down. The Championship became fully professional in 2009‚Äì10; League 1 is semi- professional. Below this there are many regional leagues. Attendances at club rugby in England have risen strongly since the sport went professional. Some clubs have good all seater grounds in the 10,000‚Äì25,000 capacity range; some have older grounds which are still partly terraced, and others play in council-owned joint-use stadia. Some clubs rent stadia from football clubs. Heineken Cup and European Rugby Champions Cup From 1995 through to 2014, the top-level European club competition was the Heineken Cup, contested by the best teams from the Six Nations countries of England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. Through its history, it was viewed by some as the top prize in European rugby for club teams. In April 2014, after two years of negotiations, it was confirmed that the Heineken Cup would be replaced by the new European Rugby Champions Cup beginning in the 2014‚Äì15 season. The Champions Cup includes the top six teams from the previous season's Premiership, with the possibility of a seventh if the seventh-placed Premiership side wins a play-off. Anglo-Welsh Cup and Premiership Rugby Cup The Anglo-Welsh Cup, known by several sponsored names during its history, was the successor to a tournament founded in the 1971‚Äì72 season as the RFU Club Competition. It was originally a national knock-out competition for English club teams, and went through several sponsored names in the next quarter-century. Starting in the 2005‚Äì06 season, it was changed into a competition for Premiership clubs plus the Welsh sides competing in the Celtic League, now Pro14. The EDF National Trophy was founded in 2005‚Äì06 as a new knock-out competition solely for English clubs, but Premiership sides do not take part. Through the 2013‚Äì14 season, the strongest Premiership teams took part in the Heineken Cup and the rest of the Premiership competed in the Amlin Challenge Cup. Since the 2014‚Äì15 season, the top Premiership sides compete in the Champions Cup, with the rest of the league involved in the new European Rugby Challenge Cup. Following the 2017‚Äì18 edition of the Anglo-Welsh Cup, the Welsh regions pulled out of the competition in favour of creating a dedicated U-23 competition for that country alone. Premiership Rugby, the company that operates the top English flight, then announced that it would launch the new Premiership Rugby Cup, featuring all 12 league members, effective with the 2018‚Äì19 season. British and Irish Cup The British and Irish Cup is a competition founded in 2009‚Äì10 by all four Home Unions for lower-tier professional and semi-pro teams throughout Great Britain and Ireland. In the competition's third season it was expanded to 32 sides from its original 24; it featured all twelve teams from both the RFU Championship and the Welsh Premier Division (the level below Pro14), \\"A\\" sides from all four Irish provinces, and the top four sides from the Scottish Premiership. The 32 teams were divided into eight pools, each with a round-robin format. The pool winners then advance to knockout quarter-finals, followed by semi-finals and a final. For season 2013‚Äì14 the competition returned to 24 sides with the reduction of Welsh clubs from twelve to four. The final English team to have won are Ealing Trailfinders in 2018. Natwest Cup The Natwest Cup is the English school's rugby union cup competition. The final is held at Twickenham Stadium. Competitions are held at the U18 and U15 age group levels. At each age group there are two competitions, a cup for schools which win their opening matches, and a vase for those who lose their opening matches. Middlesex 7s The Middlesex 7s is the premier club-level rugby sevens event held in England (note, however, that international sides have taken part on occasion). London Sevens National men's sevens teams compete annually in the London Sevens at Twickenham, which has usually been the final event in each season's World Rugby Sevens Series since 2011‚Äì12, though it is not the final event in the current 2017‚Äì18 series. Premiership Derbies The following games are considered premiership derbies. *Midlands derbies - between Northampton Saints, Leicester Tigers, Wasps and Worcester Warriors *West Country derbies - historically between Bath, Bristol and Gloucester, and now also including Exeter Chiefs *London derby - between Harlequins and London Irish. Popularity Participation According to World Rugby, England has 1,900 rugby union clubs; 6,060 referees; 362,319 pre-teen male players; 698,803 teen male players; 121,480 senior male players (total male players 1,182,602) as well as 11,000 senior female players. But these statistics are somewhat unreliable. Sport England indicates that 170,200 people play rugby at least once a week. Rugby union has often been considered, somewhat pejoratively, a 'posh' game. This may be historically linked to the split between Northern teams and the rest of the rugby fraternity over 'broken time payments', i.e. professionalism. This split led to the development of the separate sport of rugby league. The amateur ethos made it difficult for players who could not afford to take time off work to play away games or to go on tour - an integral part of the rugby tradition. Rugby union in many parts of England is associated with fee-paying independent schools such as Stonyhurst College or Sedbergh School who have historically provided many of the national players. It is also commonly played at Grammar schools, but Comprehensive schools in much of the country tended not to play the game, although this is no longer the case. Whilst rugby union was officially an amateur sport, many rugby union players came to play rugby league. In recent years this trend has reversed and some rugby league players have crossed codes to play union. Due to the split with most of the Yorkshire and Lancashire clubs, rugby union remained more popular in the South and the Midlands than the North of England, although this trend is now nowhere near as prevalent, with many teams in the North able to field four or five senior sides per week. The Newcastle Falcons and Sale Sharks are the only Northern teams in the Premiership, whereas Yorkshire Carnegie has also competed there previously. Although four of the teams in the Premiership have historic links with London, one of these has now moved to a neighbouring town and a second has moved to the more distant city of Coventry, and only Harlequins and Saracens now play in the capital, respectively in the outer suburbs of Twickenham and Hendon (Saracens had also played in a neighbouring town before returning to London in early 2013). At an amateur level, however, rugby remains strong in the London area. Interest in the population and viewing figures English rugby union receives extensive coverage from major media outlets. Currently BT Sport covers the majority of Gallager Premiership games, the BBC and ITV share coverage of the Six Nations, Sky covers England's June & November internationals and ITV covers the Rugby World Cup. BT Sport and Sky Sports share coverage of the European club competitions. The percentage of people declaring to be interested in rugby union in England has been fairly constant over the period 1996-2005, for which we have data. This proportion decreased slightly from 24% in 1995 to 18% before the 2003 Rugby World Cup, it jumped to 27% after England's victory over Australia in the World Cup final. In 2005, 23% of the population were declaring an interest in rugby union, placing this sport at the 6th place in England. To the question whether they watch rugby union on TV, 21% of sampled people answered positively in 2005, up two points relative to 1996 (19%). In this category, it places rugby union at the second place in England behind football. The viewing figures for the final of the Premiership indicate that 91,000 viewers watched the 2011 final on TV when it was broadcast on ESPN for the first time. In 2010, the final was watched by 225,000 viewers on Sky. In terms of average attendance, the Aviva Premiership is the third best attended club competition in England behind the top two association football leagues, the Premier League and The Championship. The highest club attendances at Aviva Premiership matches are starting to become similar to some of the lower attended matches in football's Championship, with game attendances averaging 12,500 in 2011 compared with 17,400 in the football Championship. Historically rugby union was a participatory sport rather than a spectator sport in England and attendances at club games were low. Leicester Tigers for example averaged less than a hundred spectators in the 1970s. However, attendances at Twickenham for the national team have always been very high. Games in the Six Nations Championship and Rugby World Cup have always been shown on network TV. Many people watch these games but don't follow club rugby, mainly due to the fact that the pay-TV Sky Sports owns the rights to the game broadcasts, and highlights are rarely shown on network television. Research from 2003 stated that the majority of spectators are from the AB1 demographic group with a gender ratio of approximately 80% male and 20% female at live domestic professional matches. However, this is a general picture of the sport across the country as a whole and, in some parts of the country, the game has widespread grassroots support. This is particularly true of the West Country, especially in Cornwall and in the cities of Bristol, Bath and Gloucester, where the game is more popular without significant class differentiation. In the Midlands, the game competes with football and the larger clubs, such as Leicester Tigers, Northampton Saints and Coventry, have considerable fanbases and strong traditions. The national team England playing Wales in the Six Nations. The English national team is currently the second best team in the history of the Six Nations Championship with three titles and one Grand Slam. When taking into account the Home Nations and Five Nations tournaments, England has more title and Grand Slams than any other nation. England contest the Calcutta Cup with Scotland and the Millennium Trophy with Ireland as part of the Six Nations Championship. They were World Champions from 2003‚Äì2007 and also made the finals of the 1991 and 2007 World Cups. World Rugby currently ranks England at 3rd out of 95 union-playing countries. They play their home games at Twickenham in Middlesex. \\"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\\" is a song associated with the national rugby union team even though it was originally sung by black slaves on the cotton fields in the south of the U.S.A. Every four years the British and Irish Lions go on tour with players from England as well as Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

Illustration by Jules Girardet. The surrender of Zaragoza, by Maurice Orange. The Second Siege of Zaragoza was the French capture of the Spanish city of Zaragoza (also known as Saragossa) during the Peninsular War. It was particularly noted for its brutality.Haythornthwaite, Philip J., Die Hard! Famous Napoleonic Battles, Cassell, London, 1996, chapter 4 Historical context As a part of the Dos de Mayo (2 May) uprising the city had already successfully resisted a first siege from 15 June 1808 to 14 August 1808. This was one of the first times in history that a regular army was defeated by irregulars in street fighting.Rickard, J (6 March 2008), Second Siege of Saragossa, 20 December 1808-20 February 1809 Further defeats ‚Äì especially the surrender of General Dupont at the Battle of Bail√©n ‚Äì forced King Joseph Bonaparte to withdraw behind the Ebro River, abandoning most of Spain except a small corner in the north-east and a small area around Barcelona. The Spanish at this point missed their best chance to defeat the French. They did not appoint a Supreme Commander, so all the armies continued to operate independently. The main armies consisted of those of General Blake on the north coast, General Casta√±os around Tudela and General Palafox around Saragossa. Blake was the most active, but he was defeated at Zornoza on 31 October 1808. Napoleon's plan was to attack in strength towards Burgos in between the armies of Blake and Casta√±os. Once they broke through they were to swing both north and south to envelope the remaining armies. In order to achieve this, Napoleon wanted the exposed Spanish armies to remain in their current advanced positions. To achieve this Marshal Moncey's 3rd Corps opposite General Casta√±os remained inactive from late October to 21 November while Ney's 4th Corps tried to get to his rear through Burgos and Soria. On 21 November 1808, the French 3rd Corps crossed the Ebro River at Logrono and headed east towards Calahorra. Marshal Ney's column reached the Upper Douro valley and headed for Tudela. To avoid being trapped, Casta√±os withdrew to Tudela and asked Palafox to help him hold a line running South of the city towards Cascante, where he intended to confront Moncey's Corps before the arrival of Ney's 4th Corps. Palafox's deputy in the area, general O'Neylle demurred stating that he had strict orders not to cross the borders of Aragon (Tudela is located in Navarre). When Palafox's approval arrived, the French attack had already begun and got the Spanish in disarray. This battle was a major victory for the French, but the Spanish armies were able to flee, O'Neylle to Saragossa and Casta√±os to Madrid, escaping with the large majority of their war chests and cannons. The stage was now set for a second siege. The defences Considerable changes occurred in the defences of Saragossa after the first siege in June‚ÄìAugust. In that siege, the city had few fortifications, except for the medieval walls that could not withstand the French artillery bombardment. The defenders consisted of only a handful of regular troops and gunners, plus a mass of thousands of volunteers. They had, however, been able to inflict heavy casualties on the French at the barricades in the narrow winding streets. Since September 1808, Colonel Sangen√≠s had been working on a number of modern fortifications. To the south, the city was protected by the Huerva River, which Sangen√≠s used as a moat with two redoubts on the south side of the river: \\"Our lady of the Pillar\\" in the south-west corner and the San Jose convent on the south-east corner. These were overlooked by the city walls. To the west, a solid rampart had been built outside the city walls, incorporating the Augustinian and Trinitarian convents. This provided a central gun battery, as well as a ditch that was 14-metres deep. San Lazaro was fortified with a rampart protected by waterways and the two convents on the north side of the Ebro River had been made into fortresses. On the key position of Monte Terrero, Sangen√≠s built an entrenched military camp using the Aragon Canal as a moat. Progress on the fortifications had been slow until the Battle of Tudela. After that, it was clear the French could attack at any moment and suddenly 60,000 volunteers were available. If the French had attacked quickly, then even this would not have helped. Due to the delay, however, the Spanish had time to improve the fortifications and obtain sufficient supplies. Inside the walls, the strong, almost entirely inflammable masonry homes and apartment buildings were laced together with internal passageways, making each block of the city its own barricaded fortress, with the numerous church buildings standing as keeps and strong-points, from which grapeshot and counter-battery fire could command the streets. The garrison would also be much stronger than in the first siege. Palafox had raised an additional 10-12,000 new recruits in Saragossa plus a further 17,000 survivors of the Battle of Tudela. By the start of the siege Palafox had 32,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry and 10,000 armed volunteers. To prevent the danger of magazine explosions, the city manufactured its gunpowder as it was needed. Supplies of Food and ammunition were sufficient for three months plus private stocks held by townspeople. The delay The Battle of Tudela was over on 23 November 1808 but the siege of Saragossa did not commence until 20 December 1808. This allowed the Spanish sufficient time to build up the defences and to lay in supplies. After the Battle of Tudela two corps had been available to attack Saragossa - the 3rd corps under Marshal Moncey and the 6th Corps under Marshal Ney. Both of these corps left Tudela on 28 November and arrived at Saragossa on 30 November. They were about to commence the siege when Marshall Ney was ordered to take his army across the mountains to New Castille where he was to prevent the army of Casta√±os, retreating from Tudela, from interfering with his movements towards Madrid. There were now only 15,000 men under Moncey facing Saragossa which was insufficient for a siege. As a result, Moncey retired to Tudela to await reinforcements from Marshal Mortier with his 5th Corps. These troops arrived from Germany on 15 December giving a total of 38,000 infantry, 3,500 cavalry, 3,000 engineers, and 60 siege guns to attack Saragossa. The siege On 20 December the French forces arrived again at Saragossa. Moncey split his forces: One division under General Gazan was assigned to the north, Mortier's corps was posted to the west, and Moncey's corps went to the south. Phase 1: The outworks 20 December 1808 ‚Äì 15 January 1809 The first key objective was the weak Spanish outworks on Monte Torrero. On 21 December 1808, three batteries began bombarding these positions followed by an attack by twenty battalions of infantry which successfully drove the Spanish out of these positions. This initial success was to prove decisive as once again the French were able to deploy their main gun batteries on Monte Terrero and were ultimately successful in breaching the southern wall. Gazan launched an attack on the same day against San Lazaro, however, this attack was unsuccessful due to the strength of the Spanish defence. On 22 December 1808 Moncey formally demanded the surrender of the city but this was refused. Moncey then decided to concentrate his efforts on the southern side of the city and prepared attacks against the Pillar redoubt and against the San Jose convent. Preparations were also made for an attack opposite the castle of Aljafer√≠a in the north-west. On 29 December 1808 Moncey was reassigned to Madrid and was replaced in command of the 3rd corps by General Jean-Andoche Junot. Mortier was then the senior officer however he worked in partnership with Junot until he was himself reassigned on 2 January 1809. The French preparations were finally complete on 10 January 1809 and they commenced bombarding the Pillar Redoubt and San Jose. By the end of the day, the San Jose walls were about to collapse. Palafox counter-attacked the French guns at 1 am on 11 January 1808 but this attack failed and the Spanish troops withdrew into the city. The French attack on the Pillar Redoubt continued until the night of 15‚Äì16 January 1808 when the 1st Polish Vistula Regiment stormed the position. The Spanish had already left destroying the bridge across the Huerva river at the same time. Phase 2: Attacking the walls, 16‚Äì27 January 1809 On 16 January 1809 the main Spanish outworks were in French hands. The French armies could now concentrate on breaching the walls of Saragossa. From 17 January 1809 the French began a bombardment of the walls from the San Jose redoubt. Palafox knew the walls would not last long and prepared barricades in the city, turning it into a maze of small forts. In January Junot was replaced with Marshall Lannes who had been recovering from an earlier injury. Sickness was now creating problems on both sides. On the French side there were now only 20,000 fit infantry. At the same time new Spanish forces were being created near the city under Francisco Palafox (younger brother of the General) and the Marquis of Lazan (older brother of the General). Lannes was concerned about his rear and recalled Mortier's division which had been protecting the lines of communication between Madrid and Saragossa. On 26 January Mortier's army defeated a peasant militia of some 4‚Äì5,000 men at Alca√±iz. The French attack commenced on 24 January 1809 when three beachheads were captured across the Huerva river. The main assault began on 27 January 1809 through three breaches in the city walls. Lannes broke through two breaches and captured the battery at the south-eastern corner and also the convent of Santa Engracia in the south-west. This marked the end of this phase of the siege with the final phase of vicious street fighting to follow. Phase 3: Street fighting 28 January ‚Äì 20 February 1809 The Spanish defenders had been preparing for street fighting from the beginning. Lannes, however, had decided on a slow block-by-block siege of each individual fortification in order to minimise French casualties. Individual battles were remarkable for their ferocity. At one point in the San Augustin Convent, the French held the altar end of the chapel and exchanged shots for hours on end with the Spanish entrenched in the nave and the belfry. However, French superiority in equipment and training took its toll, and thousands were falling daily both in the fighting and to disease, which was rampant throughout the city. By February illness was decimating the population of Saragossa and only 8,495 men remained of the original garrison of 32,000 men. There were 10,000 dead and 13,737 sick or wounded. The French were unaware of this however and morale was low due to the apparent never-ending battle in the narrow streets. Disappointed with the slow progress, Lannes ordered the troops north of the river to make a second attack on San Lazaro and on the 18th of February 1809 this attack was successful. The northern part of Saragossa could now be attacked with artillery. By 19 February 1809 the Spanish defence was failing and Palafox himself was seriously ill. He sent his aide to Lannes to discuss terms of surrender. He then resigned his military command in favour of General St. March, and his civil command of the city to a 33-member council of local citizens. The first offer of surrender was rejected and fighting resumed on 20 February 1809 but the civilian council quickly negotiated to end the fighting which ceased that evening. Most of the city lay in ruins, and around 54,000 people had perished in the siege.Napoleon's Total War Aftermath Under the terms of surrender the garrison marched out of the city and stacked their arms outside the Portillo gate. They had the choice of going into captivity or joining the French army. Of the 32,000 men at the start of the siege only 8,000 survived. The terms of surrender allowed private property to be respected and a general amnesty was granted to the city. Although some looting took place the city was not sacked. The suffering of the city had been terrible with estimated deaths of 54,000 made up of 20,000 soldiers and 34,000 civilians. Lannes himself estimated that the population of Saragossa had fallen from 55,500 to 15,000. The city considered the Florence of Spain was completely destroyed, losing many emblematic buildings like Abbey of Santa Engracia or the houses of the kingdom, the government headquarters of the medieval era. The French had also suffered losing about 10,000 men ‚Äì 4,000 in battle and the rest to sickness. Palafox himself was harshly treated by the French who imprisoned him as a traitor at Vincennes.

New Yorks Vulture.com praised it as the greatest film about gambling ever made. Plot A friendship develops between Bill Denny (George Segal) and Charlie Waters (Elliott Gould) over their mutual love of gambling. Charlie is a wisecracking joker and experienced gambler constantly looking for the next score. Initially, Bill is not as committed a gambler (he works at a magazine during the day), but he is well on his way. The two bond when they are wrongfully accused of colluding at a casino's poker table by an irate fellow player. As the two men hang out more, Bill becomes more addicted to the gambling lifestyle. He goes into debt to Sparkie (Joseph Walsh), his bookie. Bill hocks possessions to fund a trip to Reno, where he and Charlie pool their money to stake Bill in a poker game (where one of the players is former world champion Amarillo Slim, portraying himself). Bill wins $18,000 and becomes convinced he is on a hot streak. He plays blackjack, then roulette and finally craps, winning more and more money. But something happens at the craps table. When he finally stops, Bill is drained, almost apathetic. After they split their winnings ($82,000), he tells Charlie he is quitting and going home. Charlie does not understand it, but sees that his friend means what he says, so they go their separate ways.

Frustrated with the progress of his career and the sorts of roles he had been playing, he wrote a screenplay about his own gambling addiction in 1971. \\"I knew so much about gambling,\\" he said. \\"And nobody writes gambling well... I was writing for all the gamblers of the world, people who are going to turn out and watch the movie and say, 'Oh, God, this man is in our heart and soul',\\" said Walsh later.Nobody writes gambling as well: Jeff Haney remembers Reno's old Mapes Hotel as he talks with 'California Split' creator Joseph Walsh Anonymous. Las Vegas Sun 11 July 2008: 8. Steven Spielberg Walsh was friends with then up-and-coming filmmaker Steven Spielberg and they worked on the script for nine months. The director was fascinated by the characters and would react to Walsh's script, offering suggestions. At the time the screenplay was called Slide and the two men had a deal to make it at MGM with Walsh as producer and Steve McQueen in the starring role. However, the studio began making unrealistic demands, like having the script be an exact number of pages and wanting the whole story to be set at the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas because MGM owned it. A month away from filming, the studio experienced a shake-up at the executive level and with it came a new set of changes. MGM wanted the story to be a mafia-related ‚Äústing‚Äù concept with Dean Martin as one of the two main characters. Walsh would no longer be the producer. He and Spielberg left MGM and took the script to Universal Pictures where they had an agreement with Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown. Zanuck and Brown then hired Spielberg to direct The Sugarland Express, leaving Walsh and his film stranded. Robert Altman The writer's agent, Guy McElwaine, contacted Altman's agent George Litto, and the director was given the script, read it and loved it. The new studio chief of Columbia Pictures was a former agent who knew Walsh's agent and green-lighted the screenplay to be made into a movie on the writer's terms. Walsh was a novice and unaware of Altman's reputation for taking liberties with the screenplays for his movies. Walsh was very protective of his script and argued with Altman numerous times about certain aspects. Walsh remembers, ‚ÄúYou know, he actually stormed out of the room many times on me during the picture, during these conversations, but he would always come back and listen as I got to know him more...‚Äù Altman eventually raised finance by forming a company with Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg, Won World Productions.Altman's 'Split' to Start Filming Los Angeles Times 15 Jan 1974: d10. Casting George Segal was cast early on and Walsh considered long-time friend Elliott Gould, but saw other actors, such as Peter Falk and Robert De Niro. He kept coming back to Gould and finally the actor called him up and convinced him that he was right for the role. Walsh recalls, ‚Äúbecause Elliott lived his gambling, he came out of the box just like in a horse race when a great horse comes out of the box. The first day of shooting, he was there as that character...After seven days, George Segal came to me and said, ‚ÄòThis guy‚Äôs [Gould] unbelievable. He‚Äôs an octopus. He is absolutely strangling me to death. I don‚Äôt even know what to do.‚Äô The man was pleading for his life.‚Äù Walsh told Segal not to try to keep up with Gould because he had actually lived the life of his character in the film and to continue acting the way he had been doing so far. Shooting Filming started in January 1974, and took place mostly in Los Angeles with two weeks' location filming in Reno California Split was the first film to use the experimental eight-track sound system that allowed eight separate audio channels to be recorded and helped develop Altman‚Äôs trademark of overlapping dialogue. To this end, he gave the supporting actors and extras significant emphasis on the soundtrack. A number of the extras were members of Synanon, an organization for ex-addicts. Altman also used champion poker player Amarillo Slim in the movie \\"to add drama to the poker game for the actors and crew. He elevated the game to a very high professional level.\\" He had originally considered Haskell Wexler to be the director of photography on the film, but went with newcomer Paul Lohmann instead. Walsh remembers that Altman defended the choice by saying, \\"They could create a look together, and he might get into conflict with Haskell or other people about making it a little prettier than it should be.\\" He ended up making the film in Los Angeles and Reno, with the latter location being very effective in keeping everyone in the spirit of the movie. Altman said in an interview, \\"Everybody was involved in that atmosphere, and there was a sense of reality because one minute you were downstairs in the Mapes casino losing money and winning money, and then a minute later you were upstairs on the set filming a crap game.\\" While on location in Reno, actress Barbara Ruick, who played a Reno barmaid, died at the age of 43, of a cerebral hemorrhage in her hotel room. Her husband, famed film composer John Williams, was left widowed with their three children. The film was dedicated to her. The ending of the film was different from originally scripted. Reception Roger Ebert, in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, wrote, \\"At the end of California Split we realize that Altman has made a lot more than a comedy about gambling; he's taken us into an American nightmare, and all the people we met along the way felt genuine and looked real.\\" Lauding the film as \\"a great movie and [...] a great experience, too,\\" he awarded it a full four stars. Vincent Canby in The New York Times called it \\"a fascinating and vivid movie, not quite comparable to any other movie that I can immediately think of.\\" He praised the film for being \\"dense with fine, idiosyncratic detail, a lot of which is supplied by Mr. Gould and Mr. Segal as well as by members of the excellent supporting cast.\\" He put it on his year-end unranked list of the best films of 1974.Canby, Vincent (January 5, 1975). \\"Critic's Choice: The Eleven Best Films of 1974\\".

The film reportedly grossed over five million dollars at the box office despite the studio pulling it early from theaters. Altman said of the reaction to his movies, ‚ÄúI just have to hope that the film I do falls in with the mass audience and they will go see it. But one reason I have problems is that they don‚Äôt advertise the films I make because they don‚Äôt know where to put them...They don‚Äôt quite know where it is, so consequently, they try to advertise it as a different film.

It continued as British Forces in Iraq until 1941 when it was replaced by AHQ Iraq. It consisted of Royal Air Force, Royal Navy, British Army, Commonwealth and locally raised units, commanded by an RAF officer normally of Air Vice-Marshal rank.Appointments Flight, 16 November 1922 Origins Following the end of World War I and the accompanying British defence cuts, the new RAF took up the task of policing the Empire from the air. In May 1920 an insurgency broke out around the Euphrates and this uprising rapidly extended to a more general area. The Air Officer Commanding the Middle East dispatched an additional squadron from Egypt to Iraq. In London the Government were seeking a solution and the Army's proposal, which involved reinforcing Iraq with large numbers of personnel, was considered to be too expensive by the Cabinet. Winston Churchill, remembering the RAF's success in Somaliland asked Trenchard for a cheaper alternative and a plan for air control using air power as a more cost-effective way of controlling large areas than by using conventional land forces was proposed.Boyle, Andrew. Trenchard Man of Vision p. 371 In Mesopotamia there was a need to counter Turkish aspirations and by 1920 a Mesopotamian Wing had been established. In January 1921 Mesopotamian Group was formed by raising Mesopotamian Wing to group status. In March 1921 at the Cairo Conference, Churchill, who was by then Colonial Secretary, along with the three service chiefs, decided that all British forces in Iraq would be put under control of the RAF. The intention was to apply the model of imperial air control which had worked in Somaliland to a much larger region which was similarly troubled. The following year, on 1 October 1922 Mesopotamian Group was absorbed into the newly formed Iraq Command which was given control of all British forces in Iraq. Locations Air Headquarter initially situated in the Old British Residency in Baghdad. The Officers were accommodated in various messes in Baghdad and the airmen in a compound at Southgate. In December 1928 the Headquarters moved from Baghdad to RAF Hinaidi Cantonment and was located in one block of the original RAF General Hospital buildings. Apart from the Air Officer Commanding's staff mess, all the AHQ personnel were then accommodated at RAF Hinaidi.An Introduction to Iraq. British Forces in Iraq, RAF Hinaidi. 1935 In 1937 Air Headquarters and the personnel moved from RAF Hinaidi Cantonment to the newly built RAF Dhibban (renamed RAF Habbaniya in 1938). The Air Officer Commanding then lived in Air House at Habbaniya. Actions Iraq Command was responsible for the following military actions: *1920 to 1922 - The Great Iraqi Revolution of 1920 started in Baghdad in the summer of 1920 and dragged on until 1922. *February to May 1923 - Following the anti-British activities of Sheikh Mahmud, delayed-action bombs were dropped outside Sulaymaniyah in an effort to get the Sheikh to adopt more pro-British policies. British land forces occupied Sulaymaniyah on 17 May and Sheikh Mahmud flees to Persia. *March to April 1923 - In response to the uncovering of Turkish plans for an attack on Kurdistan, supported by local tribes associated with Sheikh Mahmud, Imperial troops and levies occupied Rowanduz and drove Turkish troops into nearby Persia. *April 1923 - The RAF flew 280 Sikh troops from Kingarban to Kirkuk in the first British air trooping operation. *25 December 1923 - Sheikh Mahmud proclaimed himself King of Kurdistan; subsequently, the RAF bombed his house in Sulaymaniyah. *December 1923 to January 1924 - The RAF bombed Akhwan raiders from Najd in an attempt to stop their attacks on the tribes living in southern Iraq. *4 May 1924 - Following a dispute between Assyrian levies and the Muslims living in Kirkuk, the levies ran amok. Air Vice-Marshal J F A Higgins had two platoons of the 1st Battalion the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers airlifted from Hinaidi to Kirkuk to restore order. *5 May 1924 - The fusiliers were reinforced by air with two additional infantry platoons. No. 30 Squadron RAF carried out thorough air reconnaissance of the Kirkuk district. The above section is incomplete. Follow-on Since August 1921, Faisal I had been King of Iraq under the League of Nations Mandate. As of 1932, the mandate ended and the Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq was nominally independent. In accordance with the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, British forces remained in Iraq. In 1933 or 1934, \\"Iraq Command\\" was renamed the \\"British Forces in Iraq.\\" By the late 1930s, these forces were restricted to two Royal Air Force stations, RAF Shaibah near Basrah, RAF Basrah (the supply depot on the Shatt-al-Arab at Basrah and RAF Habbaniya west of Baghdad.David Lee, Flight from the Middle East, pg. 95 There were several Commanders of the \\"British Forces in Iraq\\".

Birth and rebirth Born to Joshua and Mary (Cushman) Soule at Broad Cove in Bristol (now Bremen), Maine, Soule was the seventh child in a Norman-English family. He was the great-great-great- grandson of George Soule, who in 1620 arrived at Plymouth, Massachusetts as a Mayflower Pilgrim, eventually becoming a prominent Duxbury landowner.George Soule of the Mayflower and his descendants in the Fifth and Sixth Generations, Part 2 (Family Numbers 350-464), by John E.

Joshua, the son of Joshua, married Sarah Allen in 1803. Although his parents were strict Presbyterians, the adolescent Joshua Soule converted to the Methodist Episcopal faith in 1797, joining the New England Annual Conference in 1799. Lake Junaluska, NC Painting of Sarah Allen Soule (1782 - 1857) Ministry He became known as a \\"Boy Preacher,\\" and an opponent of Calvinism, Unitarianism and Universalism. Tall, dignified and able, Soule was ordained, both deacon and elder, by Bishop Richard Whatcoat. He was appointed a presiding elder at the age of 23, placed in charge of the state of Maine. He also served as a book agent for the M.E. Church. In 1820, he was elected bishop, but declined consecration because the General Conference had adopted a policy he could not approve. He did accept episcopal consecration upon being elected again in 1824. In the 1844 split of the M. E. Church, he sided with the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Soule University in Texas was named in his honor in 1856. At that time there was another Methodist institution of higher learning named for Joshua Soule, Soule College in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.Text of historic marker for Soule College at Latitude 34 North, retrieved 25 May 2017.

The song is played following each Eagles touchdown at home and as part of pre-game festivities before the playing of the national anthem.  History  \\"The Eagles' Victory Song\\" was the creation of Charles Borrelli and Roger Courtland, as credited in various editions of Eagles programs from the late 1950s through the 1960s. In 1963, Jerry Wolman purchased the Eagles' football team. Wolman was a sports fan growing up and loved hearing the Redskins' fight song \\"Hail to the Redskins\\" at games. Spawning from his admiration for the Redskins' song, Wolman searched for musicians to implement a team song for the Eagles, and founded The Philadelphia Eagles' Sound of Brass band in 1964. The group included 200 musicians and dancers, and was led by Arlen Saylor, who was appointed as the Eagles' entertainment director in 1966 and is credited with penning an arrangement of the fight song that the band played at home games during halftime in the 1960s. Wolman's push to popularize the fight song flew under the radar, however, and in 1969 the Sound of Brass band was discontinued. The song came back into light in 1997, when Bobby Mansure, founder of an unofficial Eagles pep band, asked team management to allow the band to play in the parking lot during home games. Management gave Mansure's pep band an audition, allowing them to play at 2 preseason games to gauge fan reaction. The song went over so well that Mansure and the band retained a permanent position as the official Philadelphia Eagles Pep Band. In 1998, following Mansure's reintroduction of the song, Eagles management attempted to rebuild its popularity among fans by changing some aspects of the song: they modified the key, changed the opening lyric from \\"Fight, Eagles Fight\\" to \\"Fly, Eagles Fly\\", and re-marketed the song with that as the title. In addition, they appended the popular \\"E-A-G-L-E-S\\" chant‚Äîwhich had emerged in the 1980s‚Äîto the end of the song. While management planned to play the song throughout the 1998 season, the Eagles' poor performance that year caused them to hold off reintroducing the song until the following year. The Eagles fared better during their 1999 season, and subsequently, the fight song was played after every score. The song is still sung/chanted today at games, and Billboard has recognized it as one of the best NFL fight songs of all time. A modern arrangement by the current Eagles Pep Band is featured on the official Eagles website. The song is also played in Philadelphia International Airport during the NFL season once every hour.

It is currently used mostly for football and American football matches and is the home stadium of Am√©rica Football Club (CE), Fortaleza, Ferrovi√°rio Atl√©tico Clube and Associa√ß√£o Esportiva Tiradentes. The stadium holds approximately 20,000 people and was built in 1941. The stadium is owned by the Fortaleza City Hall, and it is named after Brazilian president Get√∫lio Vargas. The stadium was the largest stadium in Fortaleza until 1973 when the Castel√£o stadium was inaugurated. History alt= Presidente Vargas Stadium was built in 1941 and was considered a modern facility at the time. The stadium was walled, had wooden grandstands and a wooden fence separating the field from fans, and a grass pitch (until then all fields in the city had clay which was moistened before games). This stadium was officially opened on September 14 of 1941, but the first match took place a week later, on September 21, when Ferrovi√°rio beat Tramways of Pernambuco 1-0. Attendance The stadium's attendance record currently stands at 38,515, set on May 7, 1989 when Ferrovi√°rio and Cear√° drew 1-1. But there are records of an audience of 41,099 in the game Cear√° 0-1 Corinthians Brazilian Championship in 1971 but there is no confirmation that this has been official. Currently, due to renovations in the stadium and the strictest safety standards, the capacity was reduced to 22,000 spectators. Renovation Between February 2008 and April 2011, the stadium was banned from making a series of improvements. The work, budgeted at R $ 48 million, foresaw the reconstruction of the roof over the social chairs, radio and TV booths, in addition to the renovation of the historic facade, the tunnels and access ramps, the changing rooms, the administration rooms, the parking lot and the press room, as well as the installation of an electronic scoreboard and glass fencing. The renovation of the Presidente Vargas stadium also included changing the entire electrical and hydro-sanitary system, the chairs and structural beams, and a new pitch. Initially, of the newly installed seats, 8% were orange and the others blue. However, the two juxtaposed colors were relatively reminiscent of the colors of Fortaleza Esporte Clube, thus generating disagreement between some fans of rival Cear√° Sporting Club. To avoid future problems, the 522 orange chairs were removed and transferred to the Estadio Antony Costa, which was also under renovation at the time. Blue chairs replaced the withdrawn seats. View of the stadium looking towards the field after renovation The stadium undergoing renovation The PV was the main stadium of football in Cear√° until the reopening of Castel√£o, in 2013, after the remodeling for the FIFA World Cup and FIFA Confederations Cup. The Caldeir√£o was also one of the training centers for the 2014 World Cup and the 2013 Confederations Cup. The stadium has the tradition of receiving the greatest rivalries of Cear√° football, such as the King Clasico (Cear√° vs Fortaleza), the Peace Clasico (Ferrovi√°rio vs Cear√°) and the Clasico of Colors (Fortaleza vs Ferrovi√°rio). In addition to such games, the stadium has also hosted games of the Copa do Brasil, and the S√©rie B and S√©rie C, the 2nd and 3rd divisions of the Brazilian league system.

Nevo b. 1932 was a Middle Eastern archeologist living in Israel. He died after a long battle with cancer in 1992. Research Nevo discovered Kufic inscriptions in the Negev desert in Israel, four hundred of which were published in Ancient Arabic Inscriptions from the Negev. This led him and Judith Koren, a librarian at the University of Haifa, to re-examine the origins of Islam, and early Islamic history. They fundamentally doubt the historicity of Islamic traditional accounts of early Islam, thus adhering to the Revisionist School of Islamic Studies. Nevo and Koren co-authored a work called Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State, which presents a theory of the origins and development of the Islamic state and religion. According to them, the Arabs conquered the Near East as pagans and took over the Jewish-Christian monotheism they encountered in the conquered land, later transforming it into their own religion. Thus, the story of Muhammad as a prophet and the Quran are considered to be not at all true. This strong skepticism resulted in heavy criticism by other historians. Some of Nevo's work is also published in the book Quest for the Historical Muhammad, edited by Ibn Warraq.

The village contains around one hundred houses on the south-facing slope of the hill. Blebo Craigs is 5 miles from St Andrews. Geography Most of the village lies on a sunny south facing slope. It borders a wood which is open to the public for walking and other leisure activities. The area of forest is the site of old quarries. The forest covers a steep slope that falls away to the cliffs of Dura Den. The village hall lies at the heart of village social life. At the door of the village hall one can find a map showing the layout of the settlement. A book describing life in the village over the last hundred years is available via the village hall secretary.  History  \\"Craig\\" is a Scots word meaning rocky promontory. Two large quarries (one for sandstone - still visible, one for roof slate can be found in the woods. Its sandstone was used to build many of the area's buildings. The quarry's galleries slowly shrank under the weight of 8 metres of overhanging rock. Most of the village plan is based on two industrial developments. The straight road east of the postbox was built along the north border of Blebo House estate lands, over Clatto Hill, then (almost) straight to Strathkinness to take the products of the Blebo Mills to Guardbridge, Dundee and St Andrews, bypassing the toll fees at Dairsie, and on the main Cupar to St Andrews roads. As the sandstone and slate quarry operations expanded into a year-round activity, (rather than transient and seasonal as they had been since Medieval times) houses and schools were built along the road after the 1830s. The architectural, and other land use history, of the village is dominated by the houses of the estates of Clatto, Blebo and Kemback, each with their own histories going back hundreds of years. All three have fine buildings. Three notable owners were the Lairds of Kemback;- an important Roman Catholic family after the Reformation, D.C Thompson of D. C. Thomson & Co. Ltd publishers of newspapers, and children's weekly comics such as The Beano, and William Low, owner of the food retailer of the same name. Connections with Dundee Flax mill workers in Dura Den and Kemback originally from Dundee forged connections with families still in the Angus town. The Boys' Brigade, 17th Company (1919 onward), then 5th Company (from the mid-1930s onward) held camps in the small wood and fields at the east end of the village until the mid-1980s. It was felt that the country air was a break from the polluted coal-dust atmosphere in the streets and congested air inside the jute mills in Dundee at the time. Weekend and summer camps were offered, with the support of the village and local farmers. A large collection of camping photographs are held by 5th Company, Dundee, and a film from 1953 is held in the Scottish National Film Archive. The village telephone box was used by the boys to earn their merit badges, making their first personal call to an officer, or officer's wife in Dundee, then answering a call correctly. Economy Blebo Craigs has little economic activity. A locally run post office is located in the village hall. Historically the village had a public house but this was converted into a house.

He did his theological studies in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Before returning to Brazil, in 1969, he underwent his baptism of the Holy Spirit at Michigan, becoming a charismatic. Establishing himself in Campinas, a city in the state of S√£o Paulo, he began to collaborate with another American Jesuit priest of the charismatic movement, Father Harold Rahm (the creator of a successful program to recover drug addicts through a method which he called Demanding Love (\\"Amor Exigente\\" in Portuguese language).

She was commissioned in mid-1944, but fuel and aircrew shortages limited her use to Japanese waters. The impending American invasion of Luzon caused the IJN to order her to transport aircraft and supplies to the Philippines in December. The ship was torpedoed and sunk by the American submarine in the East China Sea during the voyage. Design and description The last purpose-built Japanese carrier construction during World War II was a group of vessels based on an improved design, but with individual units differing in detail reflecting the changing circumstances as the conflict in the Pacific approached its conclusion. Unry≈´ was ordered, under the provisional name of #302, as part of the Rapid Naval Armaments Supplement Programme of 1941.Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, pp. 55‚Äì57 The ship was one of 16 Unry≈´-class aircraft carriers planned, although only three were completed before the end of the war. Unry≈´ had a length of overall. She had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced . Her crew consisted of 1,595 officers and men.Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 56 The ship used the same turbines and boilers as used in the heavy cruiser . These consisted of four geared steam turbine sets with a total of , each driving one shaft, using steam provided by eight Kampon Type B water-tube boilers. The ship had a designed speed of . Unry≈´ carried of fuel oil which gave her a range of at . She had two funnels on the starboard side, each angled below the horizontal. They were fitted with a water-cooling system to reduce the turbulence caused by hot exhaust gases.Lengerer 2010b, pp. 115, 117 Flight deck arrangements Unry≈´s flight deck was long and had a maximum width of . A small island was mounted well forward on the starboard side and contained the ship's bridge and air operations control center. It was fitted with a small tripod mast that mounted one of the ship's radar antennas. The ship was designed with two superimposed hangars that were served by two aircraft elevators, each ; the center elevator as used in Hiry≈´ was deleted to simplify construction and reduce stress in the hull. The elevators had a maximum capacity of and took 19 seconds to go from the lower hangar to the flight deck. Unry≈´ was fitted with hydraulically operated Type 3 arresting gear with nine cables. She also mounted three Type 3 crash barricades. No aircraft catapult was fitted. The ship mounted a retractable crane on the starboard side of the flight deck, just aft of the rear elevator.Lengerer 2010b, pp. 110‚Äì12, 118 Unry≈´ carried of aviation gasoline for her aircraft.Lengerer 2010a, p. 154 The ship's air group was originally intended to consist of 12 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, plus 3 in storage, 27 Aichi D3A Val dive bombers, plus 3 in reserve, and 18 Nakajima B5N \\"Kate\\" torpedo bombers plus 2 in crates. Unry≈´s hangars could not accommodate so many aircraft so 11 planes were planned to be permanently carried on the flight deck. In 1943 the air group was revised to consist of 18 Mitsubishi A7M \\"Sam\\" fighters (+2 in storage), 27 Yokosuka D4Y \\"Judy\\" dive bombers and 6 Nakajima C6N \\"Myrt\\" reconnaissance aircraft. Of these, the C6Ns were intended to be carried on the flight deck. When the ship was commissioned in 1944, neither the A7M nor the C6Ns were yet in service, so the air group was reconfigured to consist of 27 Zeros, 12 D4Ys, 3 of which were to be the reconnaissance version, and 9 Nakajima B6N \\"Jill\\" torpedo bombers. By this time, however, the shortage of carrier-qualified aircrew was such that they were ordered to operate from shore bases and Unry≈´ never embarked her full air group.Lengerer 2010b, pp. 117‚Äì18 Armor, armament and sensors Unry≈´s waterline armored belt was thick over her machinery spaces, but this increased to over her magazines. Her deck armor above the machinery was thick, but the armor above the magazines was thick.Chesneau, p. 184 The ship's primary armament consisted of a dozen 40-caliber 12.7 cm (5 in) Type 89 anti-aircraft (AA) guns in twin mounts on sponsons on the ship's sides.Lengerer 2010b, p. 118 Unry≈´ was initially equipped with 16 triple 25 mm (1 in) Type 96 and 3 single Type 96 AA gun mounts, most on sponsons along the sides of the hull. These guns were supplemented by six 28-round AA rocket launchers. Shortly after completion, another 4 triple and 13 single 25 mm mounts were added.Stille, pp. 37‚Äì38 For defense against submarines, the carrier was fitted with six depth charge throwers and carried between six and ten depth charges for them. A Type 3 sonar and a Type 93 hydrophone were fitted to detect any submarines. Two Type 94 high-angle fire-control directors, one on each side of the ship, were fitted to control the Type 89 guns. Each director mounted a rangefinder. Six Type 95 directors controlled the 25 mm guns and the 12 cm rocket launchers. Early warning was provided by two Type 2, Mark 2, Model 1 search radars. One of these was mounted on the top of the island while the other retracted into the port side of the flight deck, between the two elevators. In addition, Unry≈´ had two smaller Type 3, Mark 1, Model 3 early- warning radars, one mounted on the tripod mast on the island and the other on the starboard aft retractable radio mast.Lengerer 2010b, pp. 119‚Äì20 Construction and career Unry≈´ was laid down at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 1 August 1942 and launched on 25 September 1943. Upon commissioning on 6 August 1944, she was assigned to the 3rd Fleet. She underwent shakedown and trials within Tokyo Bay through mid-September, and was then transferred to Kure Naval District, from which she made numerous training runs around the Seto Inland Sea until December. From 30 October to 7 November, she served briefly as the flagship of Vice Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa‚Äôs Mobile Fleet. Eight days later, the Mobile Fleet was disbanded and the ship was transferred to Carrier Division 1. Later that month, some A6Ms and B6Ns were embarked.Tully, IJN Unryu: Tabular Record of Movement Final voyage Unry≈´ sinking, December 19, 1944. Photo taken through the periscope of Redfish. On 13 December 1944, thirty Yokosuka MXY7 ≈åhka kamikaze rocket planes were loaded aboard Unry≈´ for transport to Manila in the Philippines. Four days later, on 17 December 1944, Unry≈´ departed Kure, Hiroshima escorted by the destroyers , , and under the overall command of Captain Konishi. Her maiden sea voyage was a vain attempt to reinforce the garrison on the island of Luzon just prior to the Allied landings there. On 19 December 1944, Unry≈´ was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine . Redfish fired four torpedoes, one of which hit directly under the carrier's bridge on the starboard side at 16:35. The hit stopped the vessel dead in the water as it severed the main steam line, flooded two boiler rooms, started several fires and gave the ship a 3-degree list. Just as the carrier began to get underway, another torpedo struck at 16:50 on the starboard side abreast the forward elevator and the highly volatile forward aviation gasoline tanks. The resulting explosion caused the warheads of the Ohka kamikaze planes stored on the lower hangar deck to detonate and essentially blew the bow off the ship. The ship listed to 30 degrees very quickly and the order to abandon ship was given. With a 90-degree list, the ship sank bow-first to the bed of the East China Sea in just seven minutes at position . Casualties were very heavy with 1,238 officers, crewmen and passengers losing their lives. Only 145 men survived to be rescued by Shigure, which returned to Sasebo, Nagasaki on 22 December.Tully, Star-Crossed Sortie: The Last Voyage Of Unryu and DesDiv 52 Unry≈´ was struck from the Navy List on 20 February 1945.

It was announced right after Emelec won the 2013 Ecuador Serie A title that Stadium George Capwell would be completely remodeled to hold a capacity of 40,000 fans. The remodeling is supposed to begin in June 2014 and ended in December 2016. In their first league season (Primera Etapa 2017) season at the expanded stadium, Emelec drew an average home attendance of 22,407. It became the highest in the league, followed by Barcelona SC with 10,572.http://www.worldfootball.net/attendance/ecu-campeonato-2017-primera- etapa/1/ Overview Founder George Lewis Capwell was born in the United States, he traveled to Ecuador to supervise his electric company ‚ÄúEmpresa El√©ctrica del Ecuador‚Äù which can be translated into English as the Ecuadorian Electric Company. While supervising the company Capwell saw that his workers were interested in soccer, therefore he decided to create a soccer team that bear the company's name, hence the name C.S. EMELEC. The colleagues funded the soccer club on April 28, 1929, Emelec was registered to the Serie C or C league in Ecuador in 1929. In 1940 a stadium was built to honor him. The stadium and its beginnings George Capwell Stadium is located to the north of General Gomez street, to the south of San Martin, to the west of Quito avenue and to the east of Montufar street. It was baptized with the name George Capwell in honor if the soccer club's president and because he also motorized the construction of the stadium and because he was the founder of the soccer club. George's idea was for the site not to be a soccer field but a baseball diamond. When popularity grew with soccer in the company and in Guayaquil, in little time the baseball field was converted into a soccer stadium, which it is to this day. Construction The process of constructing the stadium started September 1940 when the council of Guayaquil approved the loaning of 4 square street blocks for the construction of Emelec's new stadium. On September 8, 1942, the municipality donated the square blocks instead of having them loaned. On October 15, 1942, the Ecuadorian Republic approved the city blocks for the stadium's construction. On June 24, 1943 the first stone was placed. The construction was completed, and the George Capwell Stadium was inaugurated with a baseball game between Emelec and Oriente, October 21, 1945 with 11,000 fans in attendance. Nonetheless, the doors opened to soccer on December 2, 1945 to inaugurate it as a soccer field, a match was held between Emelec and Manta-Bahia; Emelec won 5-4 The Ecuadorian local tournament was won by Emelec because they had won their local title for the first time. A year later, November 30, 1947 the stadium opened its doors to international soccer when Guayaquil, Ecuador hosted the Copa America, Estadio Capwell was the stadium host.

Frederick Walker is today best known as the first Commandant of the Native Police Force that operated in New South Wales and Queensland. He was appointed commandant of this force by the NSW government in 1848 and was dismissed in 1854. During this time period the Native Police were active from the Murrumbidgee/Murray River areas through the Darling River districts and into what is now the far North Coast of NSW and southern and central Queensland. Despite this large area, most operations under Walker's command occurred on the northern side of the Macintyre River (i.e., Queensland). Detachments of up to 12 troopers worked on the Clarence and Macleay Rivers in NSW until the early 1860s and patrols still extended as far south as Bourke until at least 1868. After his dismissal from the Native Police, Walker became involved in the pastoral industry as a squatter, as well as organising a private native police force and leading a number of expeditions into Northern Queensland. Early years Walker was born in Hampshire, England in 1820 to a relatively illustrious family. His father, John Walker, an officer in the British Army, lived until 1837 and was a landholder at Purbrook Park. His mother, the French-born Maria Teresa Henrietta Swinburne, was a daughter of the aristocratic travel writer Henry Swinburne and granddaughter to Sir John Swinburne 3rd Baronet. Frederick's sister, Harriet Walker, was married to Reginald Yorke, a rear-admiral in the Royal Navy. One of Frederick's brothers, Robert George Walker, also became a Native Police officer, achieving the rank of first lieutenant in 1861. Two other siblings of Frederick were apparently handicapped. He emigrated to Australia by the Ceylon in 1844 and was shortly after employed on William Charles Wentworth's massive Murrumbidgee River station Tala (also known as Yanga) where he served as superintendent. In the same year, he was made a corporal in the paramilitary Border Police unit based in the Murrumbidgee District. In 1845, Walker was appointed as Clerk of Petty Sessions in Tumut and in April 1847 he attained the same position at Wagga Wagga. On 18 August 1848 he was appointed \\"Magistrate of the Territories and its Dependencies\\" and Commandant of newly established Native Police ForceBell's Life in Sydney 12 August 1848, page 2; Maitland Mercury & Hunter River Advertiser, 23 August 1848, page 3 on the recommendation of his former employers William Charles Wentworth (1790‚Äì1872) and Augustus Morris (1820?-1895), both members of the New South Wales Legislative Council. Native Police Walker had attracted attention, it was later stated, by his capacity to engage local Aborigines, understand their culture, speak their language and use this to secure peaceful coexistence between them and the white settlers. He also had previous practical experience in the Murrumbidgee District of utilising intertribal hostility for the benefit of British occupation. In 1847, Walker was called upon by frontier squatter Edmund Morey to punish the local Tati Tati people for interfering with the formation of his Euston pastoral station on the Murray River. Walker set out with two armed Aboriginals named Robin Hood and Marengo from the neighbouring Edward River tribe. At Lake Benanee, with the aid of other squatters they shot dead a number of Tati Tati in a skirmish that ended the tribe's resistance. Walker appears to have obtained his Aboriginal name of Morum Billak or Muroo Billi while living in the Murray River area. There is conjecture as to the actual meaning of the name but it has been stipulated to mean either Long Legs or Big Nose. The Native Police Force that Walker was to command was formed in August 1848 in the Deniliquin area on the Edward River and commenced training later that year. Fourteen 15- to 25-year-old Aboriginal troopers were picked from four different Murrumbidgee tribes, by all accounts a well drilled and highly disciplined band greatly committed and attached to their Commandant who remained exceedingly proud and protective of his men. Subsequently, Walker travelled with his force up the Darling River, arriving at the Macintyre River (at the present-day southeastern border of Queensland) on 10 May 1849. Once arriving on the Macintyre River on 10 May 1849, the force aggressively pacified the local aboriginals resulting in \\"some lives lost\\". They were then deployed to the Condamine River where the \\"Fitzroy Downs blacks\\" were routed and another group were \\"compelled to fly\\" from the area. Walker found most of the squatters and magistrates in the region thought the Native Police were there to shoot down the natives so they wouldn't have to. Walker encouraged the squatters to admit the local aboriginals onto their runs so that they could be easily observed and controlled. This was done and Walker's measure of success was the resulting increase in land values. These first actions of the Native Police reduced to great effect Aboriginal attacks and resistance against squatters in the Macintyre and Condamine regions. Walker was successful in ending the attacks of the Bigambul people in the Macintyre district. His stated aim was their annihilation, and by 1854 only 100 of the Bigambul people were left alive. Walker expanded the Native Police force during the early 1850s into the Wide Bay-Burnett, Maranoa, Clarence River, Macleay River, Dawson River, Port Curtis and Darling Downs regions. They conducted wide-ranging and frequent operations resulting in many dispersals and summary mass killings. Governor Fitzroy noted in the 1851 end of year report \\"that a great many blacks were killed,\\" however no official action was taken to change the aggressive functioning of the force. A large contingent of Native Police troopers were utilised in an invasion of Fraser Island. Walker with Lieutenant Richard Purvis Marshall and Sergeant Doolan and three divisions of troopers, together with local landholders set out from Maryborough. The force landed on the west coast of the island where the divisions split up to scour the region. Marshall's section shot a number of Badtjala and captured several. Bad weather hampered operations and Commandant Walker subsequently allowed his division to track down other groups of Badtjala without him. This group chased the local Aboriginals across to the east coast where they mustered them into the ocean. When the first overlanding pastoralists entered the Port Curtis area, the 1st Division of Native Police under Commandant Walker was sent into the region to \\"have a month's sharp shooting.\\" The size of the Native Police expanded further in 1854 to 10 Divisions and as a consequence their violent methods were becoming increasingly noticeable. Supporters of the force had to defend charges of \\"wanton cruelty\\" perpetrated by the force by justifying the need of \\"cutting a lane to the culprit through the bodies of his defenders\\". Further official complaints to the government in Sydney of massacres of peaceful \\"station blacks\\" by the Native Police were brushed off in parliament by the Attorney- General as unfounded or exaggerated. Embarrassing information like these reports and further complaints from squatters, such as William Forster, who felt they didn't get enough protection from the force, as well as certain financial irregularities, pushed the NSW Government into organising an inquiry into the Native Police. Commandant Walker was suspended from duty in September and the inquiry, to be held in Brisbane, was set for December. The inquiry was closed to the public and the report was kept secret for two years and even then only fragments of information were released. It revealed that Walker arrived at the inquiry completely drunk and surrounded by nine of his black troopers. The troopers were denied entry, and after an attempt to continue with proceedings, the inebriation of Walker forced an adjournment to the inquiry which was later quickly and conveniently abandoned altogether. An attempt by 2nd Lieut. Irving to confront Walker, resulted in the ex-Commandant drawing a sword against him. Eventually, Walker wandered off and was subsequently dismissed from the Native Police. He was later apprehended at Bromelton, charged with the embezzlement of ¬£100 and sent to Sydney. Run- hunter and private militia By 1857, Walker was back on the northern frontier of British colonisation in Australia, employed on Serocold and Mackenzie's Cockatoo station. Here he formulated plans with squatter George Serocold to examine land for occupation in the upper reaches of the Comet River. He set out with another squatter named Wiggins and three Aboriginal men, two of whom were Peabody and Jamie Sandeman, to hunt for these pastoral runs. On returning to Cockatoo, Walker's camp was attacked by local Aboriginals at Conciliation Creek in the Zamia Valley. Walker received two severe spear wounds and with difficulty made his recovery at nearby Palm Tree Creek station owned by squatters Scott and Thompson. At this time the Hornet Bank massacre occurred and Andrew Scott requested assistance from the now recovered Walker to assist with the protection of his newly acquired land. Walker recruited ten of his ex-Native Police troopers and formed a private militia that roamed the Dawson River area conducting punitive missions against local Aboriginal groups. Walker utilised Hornet Bank station as a base and travelled as far as Mount Abundance during his patrols. His troopers included Larry, Boney, Jingle, Billy, Coreen Jemmy and Coreen Neddy. The troopers were actively recruited from the discharged members of the Native Police and were financed by local squatters unhappy with the government run force. George Serocold described the situation as a Border War and even called for the importation of the Cape Mounted Rifles from Africa to give a lesson to \\"these savages as will enable us to gain our moral ascendency, let them be made to feel the miseries of war\\". The Queensland Government eventually determined that Walker's private militia was illegal and ordered its dissolution in 1859. William Wiseman, the Commissioner for Crown Lands in the region, was sent to the Dawson River to enact the order. He found that Walker's troops were conveniently already dissolved and working on Andrew Scott's Hornet Bank and Pollet Cardew's Eurombah stations as shepherds earning ¬£35 per annum. Frederick Walker was also employed as overseer and ex-Native Police officer Ross was superintendent. In September 1859, Walker officially became a pastoral squatter, taking up the Meteor Creek, Clematis, Carnarvon Creek and Consuelo runs in conjunction with established squatters Serocold, Wiggins and Mackenzie. He expanded his property interests in 1860 by establishing the Planet Downs station on the Comet River with Daniel Cameron, and helped Rolleston and the Dutton brothers take up their runs nearby. Walker continued his method of pacification of local Aboriginals by allowing those who submitted to British occupation to remain on their land as indentured labour. This strategy went against official Queensland Government policy at the time which encouraged the forcible removal or elimination of Aboriginals from desirable frontier grazing lands. As a result, Walker and the other squatters who associated with him made frequent official complaints against the actions of magistrates and Native Police in the area. Walker wrote letters to the Attorney-General complaining of the actions of Lieutenant Patrick of the Native Police killing peaceable Aboriginals on his run. He also described how magistrates in the area viewed the \\"native blacks\\" as aliens in their own land, legally voiding them of any rights and refusing to prosecute white people who had murdered them. Walker also wrote about the Juandah massacre, where many innocent Aboriginals were shot and killed by vigilantes in the Juandah courthouse. Around this time, Walker was also commissioned by a Sydney pastoral company to locate a suitably large area of land to graze 100,000 head of sheep. Walker located this area on the Barcoo River and as a result of this expedition became one of the first British people to enter this region. 1861 Burke and Wills recovery expedition In 1861 Walker led a party, ostensibly in search of the ill-fated Burke and Wills expedition, but his focus was more upon hunting for new pastoral runs. His meticulous journal of the search is often transcribed from the abridged version published by the Royal Geographical Society, but the full version is found in the correspondence of the Gulf of Carpentaria exploration expedition of Commander Norman. On 25 August 1861, Walker set out from Rockhampton accompanied by ex-Native Police troopers Jingle, Rodney, Patrick, Coreen Jemmy and Jemmy Cargara. These aboriginal men had served Walker for many years and were vital in ascertaining the terrain and communicating with the local indigenous people. Walker acknowledged their importance by naming mountains and rivers after them. However, this mutual respect was not extended to some aboriginal groups met with along the way. On 30 October near the Stawell River, the party met with a group of locals who they deemed hostile. Walker writes that 'It was now for us to be doing...Now was shown the benefit of Terry's breech loaders, for such a continued steady fire was kept up.' Out of around 30 aboriginals armed with spears, 12 were killed and 'few if any escaped unwounded.' On 1 December near the Leichardt River, Walker's party charged another group of aboriginals resulting in 'a heavy loss.' Despite the obvious advantages in weaponry, Walker managed to find himself in a dangerous situation on 4 December. Walker and Jingle, being separated from the others and with only limited ammunition and one horse, were being surrounded and had to flee in panic for eighteen miles before considering themselves safe. This incident is an example that without the horse and the rifle, British colonisation of Australia would have been far more difficult. Three days later, the group, having reformed, achieved the rendezvous point with Captain Norman. They had failed to locate Burke and Wills and their party. 1866 Electric Telegraph survey and death Frederick Walker's route (dotted red line) for the proposed electric telegraph in 1866 In 1866, Walker was employed by the Superintendent of Electric Telegraph to survey a 500-mile route from Bowen to Burketown in a bid to compete against South Australia for the end of the Trans-Oceanic link from Europe. Although the South Australian project won the race and Darwin became the terminus, Walker did manage to lead an expedition to survey a route for the Burketown line. His expedition consisted of himself as leader, H.E.Young, Mr. Perrier, Mr. Ewan, Mr. Merryweather and four Aboriginals who went by the names of Paul, Alfred, Charley and Tommy. On making their way to the starting point of Bowen, Walker had a severe fall from a horse and was subsequently unwell for most of the remainder of his journey. He arrived in Burketown with his party at the height of the Gulf Fever ‚Äì a typhoid which affected the Gulf after the arrival in Burketown of a vessel on which all the crew except the Captain died. To compound matters, Walker's camp just outside the settlement was described by H.E.Young as the \\"worst camp that I had ever seen\\", with no shade and poor water. Walker had chronic diarrhoea while he was at this camp. The party commenced their return journey but at Floraville, Walker became too weak to continue and after several days he died on 19 November 1866. The entry in H.E.Young's journal recorded Walker's passing: \\"as soon as the horses were brought up and a couple saddled, Perrier and Ewan were starting for the doctor of the Leichhardt search expedition which was camped about six miles off. But he died before they mounted. He died at noon and was buried on the evening of the same day.\\" The administration of Walker's will was completed in London on 13 April 1867. His entire effects of ¬£1160 14s 11d were left to his sister Harriet Yorke. Legacy Walkers Creek, located near Marathon Station in far north Queensland is named after Frederick Walker. Frederick Walker's grave is located south of the township on Floraville Station, in far north Queensland. The inscription reads: > On August 17 1848 Frederick Walker, aged 28, was appointed to the position > of Commandant of the Corps of Native Police having emigrated from Australia > from England. The Corps commenced with fourteen troopers recruited from four > different New South Wales tribes.

Currently, it employs 160 workers and designs a new line of footwear every year to keep up with global fashion trends. Naot's products include a variety of shoes and sandals for men, women and children with special insoles that conform to the shape of the wearer's foot. Footbeds can be replaced by a user's custom orthotic insoles, or by standard replacements for worn ones.Description of Naot footwear In 1988, shoe manufacturing in Israel suffered from the glut of inexpensive imports from the Far East. Naot Mordechai considered shutting down its shoe factory. The economic situation of the kibbutz was so serious that it became part of a study of failing companies at the economics department of Tel Aviv University. Ami Bar-Nahor was assigned to be a consultant for Naot Mordechai as part of a class exercise. He came up with the idea of modernizing both the product and production to attract the new health-conscious shoe consumer. \\"I aimed at a sort of Israelization of Birkenstock,‚Äù said Naor, referring to a well-known German footwear manufacturer. Bar-Nahor spent four years at Naot Mordechai. Traditional biblical sandals had inflexible soles; Naot used a flexible footbed of cork, natural rubber or leather. Adjustable leather straps allowed for swelling of the feet. Bar-Nahor hired young designers from the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem and Shenkar College in Tel Aviv to add color and interest to the old style sandals produced mainly in beige, brown and black. In 2006 Shamrock Holdings, based in Burbank, California, paid US$31 million for the purchase of 66 percent of the enterprise.Hadassah magazine: article on Israeli footwear manufacturing, 14 June 2010 In 2011 Teva Naot was targeted by Canadian protesters who said that the soles were manufactured in the controversial Gush Etzion West Bank settlements.

In January of 2019, Fontbonne Academy changed its name to Fontbonne Early College of Boston. Enrollment Enrollment has multiplied from 97 students in 1954 to just under 400 in 2011. The student body is drawn from more than 45 cities and towns throughout the Boston area, MetroWest, and the South Shore. The school has a seven-acre campus with the original building that has been updated over the years to include science, technology and language labs. The building had a facelift in 2010 and installed many energy-saving improvements throughout. Fontbonne Academy boasts a 100% college acceptance rate. The Class of 2013 averaged $175,000 per student in grants and scholarships to four-year colleges. History Founded in 1954, the academy takes its name from Mother St. John Fontbonne, who re-established the congregation in France after its suppression during the French Revolution. Under her leadership, the first Sisters came to the United States. In Boston, the congregation taught in archdiocesan parochial schools, and also founded and conducted its own ministries, of which Fontbonne is one. As a sponsored ministry, Fontbonne Academy furthers the Sisters' charism ‚Äî a direct outgrowth of the order's experience in revolutionary France ‚Äî of reconciliation, unity and non-violence in the school's academic programs, spirituality, and co-curricular activities.  Employment discrimination controversy  In July 2013, Fontbonne Academy rescinded a job offer made to Matthew Barrett, who had been offered a position as food services director, after Barrett listed his husband as his emergency contact on his hiring paperwork. Barrett, represented by attorneys from GLAD, filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination in January 2014. The case moved to Massachusetts Superior Court, and on December 16, 2015, Judge Douglas H. Wilkins ruled in Barrett v.

The Treaty of Windsor (1175) was a territorial agreement made during the time of the Norman invasion of Ireland. It was signed in Windsor, Berkshire by King Henry II of England and the High King of Ireland, Rory O'Connor.  Treaty  Overall, the agreement left O'Connor with a kingdom consisting of Ireland outside the provincial kingdom of Leinster (as it was then), Dublin and a territory from Waterford Dungarvan, as long as he paid tribute to Henry II, and owed fealty to him. All of Ireland was also subject to the new religious provisions of the papal bull Laudabiliter and the Synod of Cashel (1172). O'Connor was obliged to pay one treated cow hide for every ten cattle. The other \\"kings and people\\" of Ireland were to enjoy their lands and liberties so long as they remained faithful to the kings of England, and were obliged to pay their tribute in hides through O'Connor.John O'Hart, Irish Pedigrees, Dublin 1892, pp.798-799. The witnesses were Richard of Ilchester, Bishop of Winchester; Geoffrey, Bishop of Ely; Laurence O'Toole, Archbishop of Dublin; William, Earl of Essex; Justiciar Richard de Luci; Geoffrey de Purtico, Reginald de Courtenea (Courtenay) and three of Henry's court chaplains. The Annals of Tigernach recorded that: \\"Cadla Ua Dubthaig came from England from the Son of the Empress, having with him the peace of Ireland, and the kingship thereof, both Foreigner and Gael, to Ruaidhr√≠ √ì Conchobhair, and to every provincial king his province from the king of Ireland, and their tributes to Ruaidhr√≠.\\" The Annals also listed the ongoing violence in Ireland at the time.The Annals of Tigernach ¬ßT1175.17 The text reveals a misunderstanding of the scope of the treaty and the matters agreed by the two kings that soon proved fatal to the peace of Ireland. Henry saw O'Connor as his subordinate within the feudal system, paying him an annual rent on behalf of all his sub-kings; O'Connor saw himself as the restored High King of Ireland, subject only to a very affordable annual tribute to Henry. Treaty Text \\"This is the agreement which was made at Windsor in the octaves of Michaelmas [October 6] in the year of Our Lord 1175, between Henry, king of England, and Roderic [Rory], king of Connaught, by Catholicus, archbishop of Tuam, Cantordis, abbot of Clonfert, and Master Laurence, chancellor of the king of Connaught, namely : The king of England has granted to Roderic [Rory], his liegeman, king of Connacht, as long as he shall faithfully serve him, that he shall be king under him, ready to his service, as his man. And he shall hold his land as fully and as peacefully as he held it before the lord king entered Ireland, rendering him tribute. And that he shall have all the rest of the land and its inhabitants under him and shall bring them to account [justiciet eos ], so that they shall pay their full tribute to the king of England through him, and so that they shall maintain their rights. And those who are now in possession of their lands and rights shall hold them in peace as long as they remain in the fealty of the king of England, and continue to pay him faithfully and fully his tribute and the other rights which they owe to him, by the hand of the king of Connaught, saving in all things the right and lronour of the king of England and of Roderic. And if any of them shall be rebels to the king of England and to Roderic and shall refuse to pay the tribute and other rights of the king of England by his hand, and shall withdraw from the fealty of the king of England, he, Roderic, shall judge them and remove them. And if he cannot answer for them by himself, the constable of the king of England in that land [Ireland] shall, when called upon by him, aid him to do what is necessary. And for this agreement the said king of Connaught shall render to the king of England tribute every year, namely, out of every ten animals slaughtered, one hide, acceptable to the merchants both in his land as in the rest ; save that he shall not meddle with those lands which the lord king has retained in his lordship and in the lordship of his bat:ons; ~at is to say, Dublin with all its appurtenances; Meath with all 1ts appurtenances, even as Murchat Ua Mailethlachlin [Murchadh 0' Melaghlin] held it fully and freely [melius et plenius] or as others held it of him; Wexford with all its appurtenances, that is to say, the whole of Leinster; and Waterford with its whole territory from Waterford to Dungarvan, including Dungarvan with all its appurtenances. And if the Irish who have fled wish to return to the land of the barons of the king of England they may do so in peace, J?aying the said tribute as others pay it, or doing to the English the servtces which they were wont to do for their lands, which shall be decided by the judgment and will of their lords. And if any of them are unwilling to return and their lords have called upon the king of Connaught, he shall compel them to return to their land, so that they shall dwell there in peace. And the king of Connaught shall accept hostages from all whom the lord king of England has committed to him, and he shall himself give hostages at the will of the king. The witnesses are Robert, bishop of Winchester ; Geoffrey, bishop of Ely ; Laurence, archbishop of Dublin ; Geoffrey Nic~olas and Roger, the king's chaplains ; William, Earl of Essex ; Richard de Luci ; Geoffrey de Portico, and Reginald de Courtenea.\\"  Outcomes  The treaty broke down very quickly, as O'Connor was unable to prevent Norman knights carving out new territories on a freelance basis, starting with assaults on Munster and Ulaid in 1177. For his part Henry was by now too distant to suppress them and was preoccupied with events in France. In 1177 he replaced William FitzAldelm with his 10-year-old son Prince John and named him as Lord of Ireland.

The original location on Restaurant Row on La Cienega Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California, was opened in 1938 by Lawrence L. \\"Lawry\\" Frank and Walter Van de Kamp. There are now several additional locations in the United States and world wide. The company is still operated by the families of the founders, with Richard R. Frank, grandson of Lawrence Frank, serving as president and CEO. For many years Lawry's carvery was unique in having only a single entr√©e on its menu, standing rib roast. It now offers alternatives such as vegetarian specials and lobster tails, but retains its focus on carved-to-order roast beef served tableside in signature style from a large metal cart. History In 1922 Frank and Van de Kamp founded the Lawry's company and created the Tam O'Shanter Inn restaurant in the Atwater Village district of Los Angeles, California, which claims to be the oldest restaurant in Los Angeles still operated by the same family in the same location. In 1938, the two opened Lawry's The Prime Rib on La Cienega Boulevard in Beverly Hills. In 1947 Lawry's restaurant moved from its original location on La Cienega across the street and a few yards further south to a larger, mostly windowless, strikingly modernistic building designed by Wayne McAllister. In 1993, it moved to a new building on the original site. McAllister's building is now occupied by The Stinking Rose, a well-known garlic-themed Italian restaurant. In 1956, just prior to the 1957 Rose Bowl Game between the Oregon State Beavers and the Iowa Hawkeyes, Lawry's entertained the two competing teams. The Beavers were fed a prime rib dinner at the Beverly Hills restaurant and the Hawkeyes the same on the Pasadena City College football field following their practice. This started an annual tradition of hosting both Rose Bowl- bound teams, although following the inaugural event with Iowa the Big Ten teams were served outside Rose Bowl Stadium from 1957-1962. By 1963, when Illinois and Washington both dined at the restaurant on separate nights prior to the 1964 Rose Bowl Game, the two team events had become known as \\"Lawry's Beef Bowl.\\" The Beef Bowl has expanded to the Dallas, Texas, location for the two Cotton Bowl participants. In 1974, Lawry's opened a satellite in Chicago's River North district, followed by restaurants in Dallas in 1983 and Las Vegas in 1997. Internationally, Lawry's opened in Jakarta in 1997, Singapore 1999, Tokyo 2001, Taipei 2002, Hong Kong 2006, Shanghai & Osaka in 2008, and Seoul in 2013. However, the Jakarta and Shanghai locations are now closed,lawrysonline.com/international locations and the Chicago location is slated to close after December 31, 2020. Seasoned salt While operating the Tam O'Shanter, Frank created a special seasoned salt for use there, which was available only to customers. In 1938, Lawry's opened The Prime Rib on La Cienega Boulevard in Beverly Hills and began marketing its signature seasoned salt in retail stores. This marked the beginning of a food products empire under the Lawry's name that today sells a wide range of seasonings and flavorings. The line was sold to Lipton/Unilever in 1979, which in turn sold it to McCormick & Company in 2008. Restaurant menu Along with roasted prime rib of beef, the restaurant is known for its Yorkshire pudding and its signature \\"spinning salad,\\" introduced when the restaurant opened in 1938 and still included with every entree. At the time of its founding, salads usually consisted of a combination of fruit, cottage cheese, and gelatin; Lawry's restaurant was one of the first to feature a green salad as an integral part of every meal. The salad is prepared tableside by a server who spins a large metal bowl of greens atop a bed of ice, which is then dressed with \\"Vintage classic dressing with sherry wine\\". The salad dressing is sold in bottles at the restaurant but not at retail.

Located in the northwestern part of the town, it carries Upper Cold River Road over the Cold River. It was closed to vehicular traffic in 2011 due to damage from Hurricane Irene and reopened as a National Historic Site on July 5, 2016. Built in 1880 by noted Vermont bridgewright Nichols M. Powers, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2014, cited as one of the finest and least-altered examples of a Town lattice truss covered bridge in the United States. Description and history The Brown Covered Bridge is set in a remote wooded ravine in northwestern Shrewsbury, about southeast of Rutland, Vermont. The bridge is a single span lattice truss of a type patented by architect Ithiel Town in 1820. It is in length, and rests on stone abutments that have been capped in concrete. One of the abutments includes an extremely large boulder, a clear adaptation of the bridge to its location. The bridge is believed to be the only standing covered bridge in the United States with a slate roof, a once-common local variant feature of area covered bridges. It has vertical weatherboard siding, with a small opening at the eaves. The bridge has a roadway width of . The bridge has received only routine maintenance throughout its lifespan, most recently in 2002, when it was resided and its abutments treated. The Brown Bridge sustained minor damage from flooding caused by Tropical Storm Irene in 2011, and was closed. It was slated for rehabilitation after a 2008 inspection. This bridge was not the first to stand on the site, with maps of the area showing a crossing here as early as the mid 19th century. The location is about northwest of the home of George Brown, for whom the bridge was named. It was built in 1880 at a cost of less than $1100, by Nichols M. Powers, a noted Vermont bridgewright who then lived in nearby Clarendon. It is the last bridge known to have been built by Powers, who died in 1897. Powers' most famous work, the Old Blenheim Bridge in Schoharie, New York, was destroyed by flooding caused by Irene in 2011. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. It is one of about 110 surviving Town lattice truss bridges built before 1955, and was identified as one of a few high-quality covered bridges in a nationwide survey conducted by the National Park Service in the 2000s. The bridge was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2014.

Early life Chris Cole was born in Statesville, North Carolina but moved to the Philadelphia area at a young age. Cole grew up in Langhorne, Pennsylvania.chriscobracole.com/biography Career Cole gained attention following the completion of a number of difficult tricks: 360 flip, Switch Frontside flip and Backside 360 ollie down the staircase at Wallenberg High School in San Francisco, California. Backside 360 Kickflip down the Carlsbad gap in Carlsbad, California & Martin Place Amphitheatre in Sydney, Australia.

Chris Cole signing autographs during the DC Riot Tour in the Netherlands. Cole was formerly a member of the G-Spot Skate and Snow team, before being sponsored by Enjoi and Zero Skateboards. Reflecting on the early stage of his career, Cole stated in a 2009 Thrasher interview: > I really like Enjoi. The brand is a breath of fresh air. I was on the East > and detached from any team member so I was kind of a guy who rode the > products, but not on the team. Especially ‚Äôcause they are a group of > friends. I hung out with Marc Johnson a couple times. He was totally cool. I > have always been a huge fan of his, so that was great. Cole's other past sponsors include World Industries, Axion Footwear, Tensor Trucks, Ezekiel clothing, Speed Demon Bearings, Enjoi, Circa Footwear, eS Footwear, Omit Apparel, but the most significant were Zero Skateboards and Fallen Footwear. In May 2013, following a bet between Cole and professional skateboarder Mike Mo Capaldi, Cole became a team rider for the Glassy brand‚ÄîCapaldi and Cole, who are teammates on the DC Shoes team, agreed that Cole would join the Glassy team if he lost to Capaldi in any contest. The pair competed in the Battle at the Berrics 6 contest on May 18, 2013 with Capaldi being the winner; however, as of July 9, 2014, an announcement had not been made regarding the new sponsorship arrangement and Cole does not appear on the brand's \\"Team\\" page.

On June 27, 2014, Cole posted an announcement of his departure from Zero on the social media platform Instagram, without a corresponding reason; however, a reply from the Zero Instagram account thanked Cole for his \\"loyalty & dedication.\\" Prior to the release of a limited edition series of 666 \\"Chris Cole\\" skateboard decks‚ÄîCole confirmed that the decks were not related to any brand, including a potential one of his own‚Äîthat he officially parted ways with zero on July 1, 2014, which is displayed on the decks in Roman numerals. Cole is perceived as an \\"ambassador\\" for skateboarding, representative of the generation that he is a member of, and he explained his perspective on the matter in an October 2014 interview: > When I started getting asked to talk about skateboarding in front of people, > I found that my love for skateboarding wasn‚Äôt the same as everybody else‚Äôs. > I have a skate rat mentality, much like the kids that are out there skating, > and less like the older, more jaded people that get paid to do it.

The line formation is a standard tactical formation which was used in early modern warfare. It continued the phalanx formation or shield wall of infantry armed with polearms in use during antiquity and the Middle Ages. The line formation provided the best frontage for volley fire, while sacrificing maneuverability and defence against cavalry. It came to the fore during the Age of Reason, when it was used to great effect by Frederick the Great and his enemies during the Seven Years' War. The line formation was very successfully first used with combined arms in the Thirty Years War by the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus the Great, at the Battle of Breitenfeld. Dodge, Theodore Ayrault (1890). Gustavus Adolphus: A History of the Art of War from Its Revival After the Middle Ages to the End of the Spanish Succession War, with a Detailed Account ... of Turenne, Conde, Eugene and Marlborough. Boston and New York: Da Capo Press Inc. . An infantry battalion would form \\"in line\\" by placing troops in several ranks, ranging in number from two to five, with three ranks being the most common arrangement. Each rank was approximately half a metre apart from the next, and soldiers in a rank were positioned closely to each other (usually within arm's length), with just enough room to present their weapons, fire, and reload. The line formation required that the troops be well-drilled and constantly supervised by officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). In 17th- and 18th-century European armies, NCOs were positioned to the rear of the line. They were equipped with long polearms, which they used to \\"dress\\" or arrange the ranks, a practice which included pushing down the weapons of any soldier who was aiming too high, as well as ensuring that the rank remained well-organized and correctly placed. Movement in line formation was very slow, and unless the battalion was superbly trained, a breakdown in cohesion was virtually assured, especially in any kind of uneven or wooded terrain. As a result, line was mostly used as a stationary formation, with troops moving in columns and then deploying to line at their destination. In addition, the line formation was extremely vulnerable to cavalry charges, from the flanks and rear, and these attacks usually resulted in the complete breakdown of cohesion and even destruction of the unit unless it was able to \\"form square\\". During the Napoleonic Wars, the British Army famously adopted a thin two-rank line formation. This was adopted to compensate for their lack of numbers and to maximize their fire frontage. The British continued to use a two-rank line until the late 19th century. The famous \\"Thin Red Line\\" of the 93rd (Highland) Regiment at the Battle of Balaklava successfully held against a Russian cavalry attack, a rare occurrence. A loose line formation called a skirmish line is used by many modern forces during assaults as it enables maximum firepower to be directed in one direction at once, useful when attacking an enemy position. It also enables the use of fire and movement.  The line formation and cavalry  French Gendarmes The line formation was also used by certain types of cavalry. The Sassanid Persians, the Mamluks, and Muslim cavalry in India often used the tactics named \\"shower shooting\\". It involved a line of fairly well-armoured cavalrymen (often on armoured horses) standing in a massed static line or advancing in an ordered formation at the walk while loosing their arrows as quickly as possible by reducing their draw length. In the 16th century, the heavy cavalry (gendarmes, reiters and cuirassiers) often attacked in a line formation. Later, dragoons began to use linear tactics, being on foot in the defence. Accordingly, the name \\"line cavalry\\" has moved from heavy cavalry to the dragoons. Hussars in the 15th-17th centuries wore armor, and often attacked in close line formation, but later hussars became a light cavalry and stopped using linear tactics. Cossacks never used linear tactics.

He holds a B.A. degree in guitar from Northern Illinois University, where he studied with jazz guitarist Fareed Haque. Fish's musical loops performed on the Appalachian dulcimer, banjo, German concert zither, and guzheng (Chinese zither) are the most widespread in the world. The loops are created by recording the actual playing of the instrument and then slicing riffs with music editing software, and used by modern composers as an enhancement or as a basis for their own music. Fish's loops have been released with Sony Pictures Digital, Peace Love Productions, and Apple iLife. Fish combined many of these exotic and folk instruments with electronics in modern musical contexts (rock, reggae, metal, fusion, blues, electronica, modern folk, etc.) recording The Aquarium Conspiracy CD with Sugarcubes/Bj√∂rk drummer Sigtryggur Baldursson and multi-instrumentalist Biff Blumfumgagnge in 1996.

The book presents a radical theory of the origins and development of the Islamic state and religion based on archeological, epigraphical and historiographical research. Methodology Using a historical methodology the authors examined not only Muslim literature but hitherto neglected sources datable to before the 9th century such as archaeological excavations, numismatics, rock inscriptions and the records of the local non-Muslim populations. They provide a large selection of inscriptions until now overlooked and uncited in the traditional histories, which for the most part are datable to the 7th and 8th centuries, and use them to trace an historical narrative considerably different from the traditional accounts. Thesis From the archeological evidence and the lack thereof from the 7th century and Islamic period, the authors cast doubt onto the veracity of the traditional accounts of early Islamic origins that are still cited as fact in most history books. Notably, the archeological, epigraphical and historiographical evidence provides, according to the authors a view of the Middle East of the 7th and 8th century that lacks the preeminence of any \\"prophet\\" or the existence of a religion that would later come to be known as Islam. Based on the evidence that is presented in the book the authors conclude that * Traditional Islamic narratives of the 7th and 8th century are a complete construct and cannot stand up to historical examination on the basis of archeological and epigraphical evidence and non-Muslim records.

In 2010, Pioneer was listed as a \\"Silver Medal School\\" by the U.S. News & World Report. In previous years Huron High School, another secondary school in Ann Arbor and Pioneer were among the largest high schools in the state, however due to the addition of Skyline High School enrollment numbers have declined.http://www.mhsaa.com/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=lxpD75plRn0%3D&tabid;=571 History Founded in 1856, Pioneer High School has held several names and occupied various buildings in its 150 years of existence. First known as the Union School, the institution opened on October 5, 1856. The school was later renamed Ann Arbor High School, and its yearbook, The Omega, was first published in 1884. In 1904, Ann Arbor High School burned down, and the rebuilt high school opened in 1906 at the corner of Huron and State Streets in Ann Arbor. This structure was later known as the Frieze Building after it was sold to the University of Michigan in 1956; it was demolished by the university in early 2007 to make way for the new North Quad residence hall. Through a local essay contest run by The Ann Arbor News, the mascot nickname, the Pioneers, was chosen in 1936. Land for a new, larger building was purchased from the University of Michigan in 1950. The new site, on West Stadium Blvd west of South Main Street, is directly southwest of the University of Michigan Football Stadium and had been used for game day parking, a tradition that continues under school district ownership. Construction of the new Ann Arbor High School building started in 1953 and was completed in time for all classes to move the new location for the fall of 1956. By the 1960s, the new building had already reached capacity, and thus the school board established Huron High School on the city's east side as the city's second comprehensive high school. The old school was renamed to Pioneer High School starting in 1968. Huron began operating as a separate school during the 1968-69 school year, before Huron's building was completed, so students from the old and new schools shared the Pioneer building that year on a split schedule with Pioneer students attending classes in the morning and Huron students in the afternoon. In 1971, Pioneer II, an experimental offshoot of Pioneer High School, was established. The school utilized a small, self-selected group of Pioneer faculty and students working under \\"free-school\\" principles, and eventually became Earthworks High School before merging with Community High School in 1978.Sharon Woodson, \\"'Free school' stresses 'learning' rather than 'teaching'\\", Ann Arbor News, September 19, 1971; Sharon Woodson, \\"Pioneer II: a close-up look at what goes on\\", Ann Arbor News, January 17, 1972. Pioneer High School was the first high school in the US to have a planetarium, which was donated to the school in 1956 by the Argus Camera Company. , it held the record for being the longest continuously run planetarium in a school in the western hemisphere. Theater The Pioneer Theatre Guild won Class A State Championships in 1986 and again in 1988 when they performed Sam Shephard's Fool For Love. In the fall of 2006, the Pioneer Theatre Guild was the first high school theater company to do a stage production of Disney's High School Musical, Willy Wonka, and Miss Saigon. Pioneer Theatre Guild was chosen to perform several \\"musical pilots\\" by Musical Theatre International, including The Little Mermaid (2015), Rock of Ages (2016), and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (2016). Pioneer Theatre Guild has put on several popular productions including Les Mis√©rables, Disney's Beauty and the Beast, Little Shop of Horrors, Romeo and Juliet, Hair, The Wizard of Oz, Thoroughly Modern Millie, and Urinetown. In both 2009 and 2010 Pioneer Theatre Guild placed second in the Michigan Interscholastic Forensic Association's theater competition. Music Pioneer has three separate music departments: band, choir, and orchestra. Pioneer's band is split into four different classes, of increasing difficulty. It has a varsity band, two concert bands(concert band white and concert band purple, the latter being higher level), and symphony band. Any students wishing to do band can be accepted to varsity band without an audition. Students wishing to move to a higher level band must audition. Pioneer also offers a jazz band. Pioneer's orchestra program's hierarchy is similar to that of the band program. The hierarchy is philharmonic orchestra, two concert orchestras (concert white and concert purple, the latter being the step above), and symphony orchestra. Philharmonic orchestra is offered to anyone wishing to join orchestra. Students audition to get seats in the higher level orchestras. Pioneer's robust choral program include introductory-level choruses, Cantando (for Soprano and Alto voices) and Cantare (for Tenor, Baritone, and Bass voices). Beyond the introductory level, there is Bel Canto (for intermediate level treble voices) and A Cappella (for advanced students of all voice parts). Pioneer's music program won its eighth Grammy Award from the Grammy Foundation in 2015, an award which goes to the best High School music programs in the United States each year. Athletics Highlights *Women's Track & Field and Cross Country: Since 1979, the Pioneer Women's Track & Field and Cross Country teams have won 20 team state championships, had over 200 All-State recipients, and more than 50 All-Americans. *Field Hockey: Pioneer Field Hockey won 5 straight state championships from 2005‚Äì2009, and has 21 titles overall.  Football  Pioneer competes in the Southeastern Conference Red Division (commonly abbreviated SEC-Red) and has one of the greatest high school football programs in the state historically. Pioneer is second behind Muskegon in all-time victories at 699 (as of the 2011 season). 2 MHSAA State Championships and 43 League Championships.

History  The manuscript is dated 5 January 1791. However, Alan Tyson's analysis of the paper on which Mozart composed the work indicated that Mozart used this paper between December 1788 and February 1789, which implies composition well before 1791. Simon Keefe has written that the composition of the work dates from 1788. By contrast, Wolfgang Rehm has stated that Mozart composed this concerto in late 1790 and early 1791. Cliff Eisen has discussed the controversy over the time of composition in his review of the published facsimile of the score.  Premiere  The work followed by some years the series of highly successful concertos Mozart wrote. The concerto may have been first performed at a concert on 4 March 1791 in Jahn's Hall by Mozart and the clarinetist Joseph Beer.Deutsch 1965, 387 If so, this was Mozart's last appearance in a public concert, as he took ill in September 1791 and died on 5 December 1791. Another possibility is that it was premiered by Mozart's pupil Barbara Ployer on the occasion of a public concert at the Palais Auersperg in January 1791.Dexter Edge, \\"Mozart's Reception in Vienna 1787‚Äì1791, in Wolfgang Amad√© Mozart: Essays on his Life and his Music, (Oxford, Clarendon 1996), p. 90  Music  The work is scored for flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, solo piano and strings, which makes it thinner than Mozart's other late concertos, all of which except for No. 23 have trumpet and timpani. It has the following three movements: Although all three movements are in a major key, minor keys are suggested, as is evident from the second theme of the first movement (in the dominant minor), as well as the presence of a remote minor key in the early development of that movement and of the tonic minor in the middle of the Larghetto. Another interesting characteristic of the work is its rather strong thematic integration of the movements, which would become ever more important in the nineteenth century. The principal theme of the Larghetto, for instance, is revived as the second theme of the final movement (in measure 65). The principal theme for the finale was also used in Mozart's song \\"Sehnsucht nach dem Fr√ºhling\\" (also called \\"Komm, lieber Mai\\"), K. 596, which immediately follows this concerto in the K√∂chel catalogue. Mozart wrote down his cadenzas for the first and third movements. Simon Keefe has discussed the concerto in detail, with emphasis on the distinctive character and experiments in style of the concerto compared to Mozart's other concerti in this genre.

The film is about the rivalry between the martial arts schools Shaolin and Wu Tang. It is also called Shaolin Vs. Wu-Tang in the Master Killer Collection. The film inspired the name of the hip-hop group Wu- Tang Clan, who used several audio samples from the English dub of the film in their 1993 debut album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). Plot summary Master Liu and Master Law are rival masters of Shaolin style kung fu and Wu- Tang style sword fighting, running schools in the same city. Their top students, Chao Fung-wu (Adam Cheng) and Hung Jun-kit (Gordon Liu), are actually close friends, with Jun-kit's sister, Yan-ling, having a crush on Fung-wu. After observing the two students fighting at a brothel, two of the local Qing Lord's (Wang Lung Wei) soldiers report the power of the styles to him. The Lord determines that the two styles are dangerous and that he must learn both. After being poisoned by the Lord, Master Law lets Fung-wu stab him. For this Fung-wu is being sent to prison. Trying to rescue Fung-wu, Jun- kit teaches a prisoner the Shaolin Chin kang fist, not knowing the prisoner is the Lords spy. After their escape from prison, the four of them (the spy, Yan- ling, Fung-wu and Jun-kit) are ambushed. To overcome the Lords men Fung-wu teaches the spy some Wu-tang sword techniques. As they are still being overpowered Fung-wu and Yan-ling have to flee the scene just to be captured by the Wu-Tang who came to prosecute Fung-wu for killing Master Law. As they leave for Wu-Tang temple Yan-ling gets shot and dies in Fung-wu arms. The Wu- Tang leave the dead body behind. Jun-kit finds it, believing the Wu-Tang killed his sister. Hoping to avenge Yan-lings death Jun-kit returns to the Shaolin temple for training as a monk. Meanwhile Fung-wu is being held at the Wu-tang temple. The Qing Lord has since learned both the styles from the spy; but, because he did not learn either from a master, his grasp on both styles is imperfect. To overcome this deficiency, he decides to have the Wu-Tang and the Shaolin destroy each other, so he may be the only master of both styles. To do this, he stages a martial arts contest between the two temples, hoping to appeal to the traditional rivalry between the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang. Jun- kit (now called Tat-chi), and Fung-wu (now called Ming-kai), are selected by their respective temples as the representatives. During the contest the Qing Lord, in his impatience to see both Wu-Tang and Shaolin destroyed, admits his true motives, and his role in Yan-ling and Master Law's deaths. Tat-chi and Ming-kai must then combine Shaolin Chin kang fist and Wu-Tang Sword style to defeat him.

It can then remove impurities from the syngas prior to the power generation cycle. Some of these pollutants, such as sulfur, can be turned into re-usable byproducts through the Claus process. This results in lower emissions of sulfur dioxide, particulates, mercury, and in some cases carbon dioxide. With additional process equipment, a water-gas shift reaction can increase gasification efficiency and reduce carbon monoxide emissions by converting it to carbon dioxide. The resulting carbon dioxide from the shift reaction can be separated, compressed, and stored through sequestration. Excess heat from the primary combustion and syngas fired generation is then passed to a steam cycle, similar to a combined cycle gas turbine. This process results in improved thermodynamic efficiency compared to conventional pulverized coal combustion. Significance Coal can be found in abundance in the USA and many other countries and its price has remained relatively constant in recent years. Of the traditional fossil fuels - oil, coal, and natural gas - coal is used as a feedstock for 40% of global electricity generation. Fossil fuel consumption and its contribution to large- scale, detrimental environmental changes is becoming a pressing issue, especially in light of the Paris Agreement. In particular, coal contains more CO2 per BTU than oil or natural gas and is responsible for 43% of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion. Thus, the lower emissions that IGCC technology allows through gasification and pre-combustion carbon capture is discussed as a way to addressing aforementioned concerns. Operations Below is a schematic flow diagram of an IGCC plant: Block diagram of IGCC power plant, which utilizes the HRSG The gasification process can produce syngas from a wide variety of carbon-containing feedstocks, such as high-sulfur coal, heavy petroleum residues, and biomass. The plant is called integrated because (1) the syngas produced in the gasification section is used as fuel for the gas turbine in the combined cycle and (2) the steam produced by the syngas coolers in the gasification section is used by the steam turbine in the combined cycle. In this example the syngas produced is used as fuel in a gas turbine which produces electrical power. In a normal combined cycle, so-called \\"waste heat\\" from the gas turbine exhaust is used in a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) to make steam for the steam turbine cycle. An IGCC plant improves the overall process efficiency by adding the higher-temperature steam produced by the gasification process to the steam turbine cycle. This steam is then used in steam turbines to produce additional electrical power. IGCC plants are advantageous in comparison to conventional coal power plants due to their high thermal efficiency, low non-carbon greenhouse gas emissions, and capability to process low grade coal. The disadvantages include higher capital and maintenance costs, and the amount of CO2 released without pre-combustion capture. Process overview * The solid coal is gasified to produce syngas, or synthetic gas. Syngas is synthesized by gasifying coal in a closed pressurized reactor with a shortage of oxygen. The shortage of oxygen ensures that coal is broken down by the heat and pressure as opposed to burning completely. The chemical reaction between coal and oxygen produces a product that is a mixture of carbon and hydrogen, or syngas. CxHy \\\\+ (x/2)O2 ‚Üí (x)CO2 \\\\+ (y/2)H2 * The heat from the production of syngas is used to produce steam from cooling water which is then used for steam turbine electricity production. * The syngas must go through a pre-combustion separation process to remove CO2 and other impurities to produce a more purified fuel. Three steps are necessary for the separation of impurities: # Water-gas-shift reaction. The reaction that occurs in a water-gas-shift reactor is CO + H2O \\\\rightleftharpoons CO2 \\\\+ H2. This produces a syngas with a higher composition of hydrogen fuel which is more efficient for burning later in combustion. # Physical separation process. This can be done through various mechanisms such as absorption, adsorption or membrane separation. # Drying, compression and storage/shipping. * The resulting syngas fuels a combustion turbine that produces electricity. At this stage the syngas is fairly pure H2. Benefits and drawbacks A major drawback of using coal as a fuel source is the emission of carbon dioxide and pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and particulates. Almost all coal-fired power plants use pulverized coal combustion, which grinds the coal to increase the surface area, burns it to make steam, and runs the steam through a turbine to generate electricity. Pulverized coal plants can only capture carbon dioxide after combustion when it is diluted and harder to separate. In comparison, gasification in IGCC allows for separation and capture of the concentrated and pressurized carbon dioxide before combustion. Syngas cleanup includes filters to remove bulk particulates, scrubbing to remove fine particulates, and solid adsorbents for mercury removal. Additionally, hydrogen gas is used as fuel, which produces no pollutants under combustion. IGCC also consumes less water than traditional pulverized coal plants. In a pulverized coal plant, coal is burned to produce steam, which is then used to create electricity using a steam turbine. Then steam exhaust must then be condensed with cooling water, and water is lost by evaporation. In IGCC, water consumption is reduced by combustion in a gas turbine, which uses the generated heat to expand air and drive the turbine. Steam is only used to capture the heat from the combustion turbine exhaust for use in a secondary steam turbine. Currently, the major drawback is the high capital cost compared to other forms of power production. Installations The DOE Clean Coal Demonstration Project helped construct 3 IGCC plants: Edwarsport Power Station in Edwardsport, Indiana, Polk Power Station in Tampa, Florida (online 1996), and Pinon Pine in Reno, Nevada. In the Reno demonstration project, researchers found that then-current IGCC technology would not work more than 300 feet (100m) above sea level.Source: Joe Lucas, Executive Director of Americans for Balanced Energy Choices, as interviewed on NPR's Science Friday, Friday May 12, 2006 The DOE report in reference 3 however makes no mention of any altitude effect, and most of the problems were associated with the solid waste extraction system. The Wabash River and Polk Power stations are currently operating, following resolution of demonstration start-up problems, but the Pi√±on Pine project encountered significant problems and was abandoned. The US DOE's Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI Phase 2) selected the Kemper Project as one of two projects to demonstrate the feasibility of low emission coal-fired power plants. Mississippi Power began construction on the Kemper Project in Kemper County, Mississippi, in 2010 and is poised to begin operation in 2016, though there have been many delays. In March, the projected date was further pushed back from early 2016 to August 31, 2016, adding $110 million to the total and putting the project 3 years behind schedule. The electrical plant is a flagship Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) project that burns lignite coal and utilizes pre-combustion IGCC technology with a projected 65% emission capture rate. The first generation of IGCC plants polluted less than contemporary coal-based technology, but also polluted water; for example, the Wabash River Plant was out of compliance with its water permit during 1998‚Äì2001 because it emitted arsenic, selenium and cyanide. The Wabash River Generating Station is now wholly owned and operated by the Wabash River Power Association. IGCC is now touted as capture ready and could potentially be used to capture and store carbon dioxide. (See FutureGen)Poland's Kƒôdzierzyn will soon host a Zero- Emission Power & Chemical Plant that combines coal gasification technology with Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS). This installation had been planned, but there has been no information about it since 2009. Other operating IGCC plants in existence around the world are the Alexander (formerly Buggenum) in the Netherlands, Puertollano in Spain, and JGC in Japan. The Texas Clean Energy project plans to build a 400 MW IGCC facility that will incorporate carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technology. The project will be the first coal power plant in the United States to combine IGCC and 90% carbon capture and storage. Commercial operation is due to start in 2018. There are several advantages and disadvantages when compared to conventional post combustion carbon capture and various variations Cost and reliability A key issue in implementing IGCC is its high capital cost, which prevents it from competing with other power plant technologies. Currently, ordinary pulverized coal plants are the lowest cost power plant option. The advantage of IGCC comes from the ease of retrofitting existing power plants that could offset the high capital cost. In a 2007 model, IGCC with CCS is the lowest- cost system in all cases. This model compared estimations of levelized cost of electricity, showing IGCC with CCS to cost 71.9 $US2005/MWh, pulverized coal with CCS to cost 88 $US2005/MWh, and natural gas combined cycle with CCS to cost 80.6 $US2005/MWh. The levelized cost of electricity was noticeably sensitive to the price of natural gas and the inclusion of carbon storage and transport costs. The potential benefit of retrofitting has so far, not offset the cost of IGCC with carbon capture technology. A 2013 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration demonstrates that the overnight cost of IGCC with CCS has increased 19% since 2010. Amongst the three power plant types, pulverized coal with CCS has an overnight capital cost of $5,227 (2012 dollars)/kW, IGCC with CCS has an overnight capital cost of $6,599 (2012 dollars)/kW, and natural gas combined cycle with CCS has an overnight capital cost of $2,095 (2012 dollars)/kW. Pulverized coal and NGCC costs did not change significantly since 2010. The report further relates that the 19% increase in IGCC cost is due to recent information from IGCC projects that have gone over budget and cost more than expected. Recent testimony in regulatory proceedings show the cost of IGCC to be twice that predicted by Goddell, from $96 to 104/MWhr.Testimony of Dr. Elion Amit, Minnesota Dept. of Commerce. That's before addition of carbon capture and sequestration (sequestration has been a mature technology at both Weyburn in Canada (for enhanced oil recovery) and Sleipner in the North Sea at a commercial scale for the past ten years)‚Äîcapture at a 90% rate is expected to have a $30/MWh additional cost. Wabash River was down repeatedly for long stretches due to gasifier problems. The gasifier problems have not been remedied‚Äîsubsequent projects, such as Excelsior's Mesaba Project, have a third gasifier and train built in. However, the past year has seen Wabash River running reliably, with availability comparable to or better than other technologies. The Polk County IGCC has design problems. First, the project was initially shut down because of corrosion in the slurry pipeline that fed slurried coal from the rail cars into the gasifier. A new coating for the pipe was developed. Second, the thermocoupler was replaced in less than two years; an indication that the gasifier had problems with a variety of feedstocks; from bituminous to sub- bituminous coal. The gasifier was designed to also handle lower rank lignites. Third, unplanned down time on the gasifier because of refractory liner problems, and those problems were expensive to repair. The gasifier was originally designed in Italy to be half the size of what was built at Polk. Newer ceramic materials may assist in improving gasifier performance and longevity. Understanding the operating problems of the current IGCC plant is necessary to improve the design for the IGCC plant of the future. (Polk IGCC Power Plant, https://web.archive.org/web/20151228085513/http://www.clean- energy.us/projects/polk_florida.html.) Keim, K., 2009, IGCC A Project on Sustainability Management Systems for Plant Re-Design and Re-Image. This is an unpublished paper from Harvard University) General Electric is currently designing an IGCC model plant that should introduce greater reliability. GE's model features advanced turbines optimized for the coal syngas. Eastman's industrial gasification plant in Kingsport, TN uses a GE Energy solid-fed gasifier. Eastman, a fortune 500 company, built the facility in 1983 without any state or federal subsidies and turns a profit.Goodell, Jeff. \\"Big Coal.\\" New York, Houghton Mifflin. 2006 There are several refinery-based IGCC plants in Europe that have demonstrated good availability (90-95%) after initial shakedown periods. Several factors help this performance: # None of these facilities use advanced technology (F type) gas turbines. # All refinery-based plants use refinery residues, rather than coal, as the feedstock. This eliminates coal handling and coal preparation equipment and its problems. Also, there is a much lower level of ash produced in the gasifier, which reduces cleanup and downtime in its gas cooling and cleaning stages. # These non-utility plants have recognized the need to treat the gasification system as an up-front chemical processing plant, and have reorganized their operating staff accordingly. Another IGCC success story has been the 250 MW Buggenum plant in The Netherlands, which was commissioned in 1994 and closed in 2013, had good availability. This coal-based IGCC plant was originally designed to use up to 30% biomass as a supplemental feedstock. The owner, NUON, was paid an incentive fee by the government to use the biomass. NUON has constructed a 1,311 MW IGCC plant in the Netherlands, comprising three 437 MW CCGT units. The Nuon Magnum IGCC power plant was commissioned in 2011, and was officially opened in June 2013. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has been awarded to construct the power plant. Following a deal with environmental organizations, NUON has been prohibited from using the Magnum plant to burn coal and biomass, until 2020. Because of high gas prices in the Netherlands, two of the three units are currently offline, whilst the third unit sees only low usage levels. The relatively low 59% efficiency of the Magnum plant means that more efficient CCGT plants (such as the Hemweg 9 plant) are preferred to provide (backup) power. A new generation of IGCC-based coal-fired power plants has been proposed, although none is yet under construction. Projects are being developed by AEP, Duke Energy, and Southern Company in the US, and in Europe by ZAK/PKE, Centrica (UK), E.ON and RWE (both Germany) and NUON (Netherlands). In Minnesota, the state's Dept. of Commerce analysis found IGCC to have the highest cost, with an emissions profile not significantly better than pulverized coal. In Delaware, the Delmarva and state consultant analysis had essentially the same results. The high cost of IGCC is the biggest obstacle to its integration in the power market; however, most energy executives recognize that carbon regulation is coming soon. Bills requiring carbon reduction are being proposed again both the House and the Senate, and with the Democratic majority it seems likely that with the next President there will be a greater push for carbon regulation. The Supreme Court decision requiring the EPA to regulate carbon (Commonwealth of Massachusetts et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency et al.)[20] also speaks to the likelihood of future carbon regulations coming sooner, rather than later. With carbon capture, the cost of electricity from an IGCC plant would increase approximately 33%. For a natural gas CC, the increase is approximately 46%. For a pulverized coal plant, the increase is approximately 57%. This potential for less expensive carbon capture makes IGCC an attractive choice for keeping low cost coal an available fuel source in a carbon constrained world. However, the industry needs a lot more experience to reduce the risk premium. IGCC with CCS requires some sort of mandate, higher carbon market price, or regulatory framework to properly incentivize the industry. In Japan, electric power companies, in conjunction with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has been operating a 200 t/d IGCC pilot plant since the early '90s. In September 2007, they started up a 250 MW demo plant in Nakoso. It runs on air-blown (not oxygen) dry feed coal only. It burns PRB coal with an unburned carbon content ratio of <0.1% and no detected leaching of trace elements. It employs not only F type turbines but G type as well. (see gasification.org link below) Next generation IGCC plants with CO2 capture technology will be expected to have higher thermal efficiency and to hold the cost down because of simplified systems compared to conventional IGCC. The main feature is that instead of using oxygen and nitrogen to gasify coal, they use oxygen and CO2. The main advantage is that it is possible to improve the performance of cold gas efficiency and to reduce the unburned carbon (char). As a reference for powerplant efficiency: * With Frame E gas turbine, 30bar quench gas cooling, Cold Temperature Gas Cleaning and 2 level HRSC it is possible to achieve around 38% energy efficiency. * With Frame F gas turbine, 60 bar quench gasifier, Cold Temperature Gas Cleaning and 3 level+RH HRSC it is possible to achieve around 45% energy efficiency. * Latest development of Frame G gas turbines, ASU air integration, High temperature desulfurization may shift up performance even further.Analisi Termodinamica di cicli Igcc avanzati, G.Lozza P.Chiesa, Politecnico di Milano, ati2000 conference proceedings The CO2 extracted from gas turbine exhaust gas is utilized in this system. Using a closed gas turbine system capable of capturing the CO2 by direct compression and liquefication obviates the need for a separation and capture system.Inumaru, Jun - senior research scientist, Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI)(Japan) G8 Energy Ministerial Meeting Symposium, Nikkei Weekly.  CO2 capture in IGCC  Pre-combustion CO2 removal is much easier than CO2 removal from flue gas in post-combustion capture due to the high concentration of CO2 after the water-gas-shift reaction and the high pressure of the syngas. During pre-combustion in IGCC, the partial pressure of CO2 is nearly 1000 times higher than in post- combustion flue gas. Due to the high concentration of CO2 pre-combustion, physical solvents, such as Selexol and Rectisol, are preferred for the removal of CO2 vs that of chemical solvents. Physical solvents work by absorbing the acid gases without the need of a chemical reaction as in traditional amine based solvents. The solvent can then be regenerated, and the CO2 desorbed, by reducing the pressure. The biggest obstacle with physical solvents is the need for the syngas to be cooled before separation and reheated afterwards for combustion. This requires energy and decreases overall plant efficiency. Testing National and international test codes are used to standardize the procedures and definitions used to test IGCC Power Plants. Selection of the test code to be used is an agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer, and has some significance to the design of the plant and associated systems. In the United States, The American Society of Mechanical Engineers published the Performance Test Code for IGCC Power Generation Plants (PTC 47) in 2006 which provides procedures for the determination of quantity and quality of fuel gas by its flow rate, temperature, pressure, composition, heating value, and its content of contaminants. IGCC emission controversy In 2007, the New York State Attorney General's office demanded full disclosure of \\"financial risks from greenhouse gases\\" to the shareholders of electric power companies proposing the development of IGCC coal-fired power plants. \\"Any one of the several new or likely regulatory initiatives for CO2 emissions from power plants - including state carbon controls, EPA's regulations under the Clean Air Act, or the enactment of federal global warming legislation - would add a significant cost to carbon-intensive coal generation\\"; U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton from New York has proposed that this full risk disclosure be required of all publicly traded power companies nationwide. This honest disclosure has begun to reduce investor interest in all types of existing-technology coal-fired power plant development, including IGCC. Senator Harry Reid (Majority Leader of the 2007/2008 U.S. Senate) told the 2007 Clean Energy Summit that he will do everything he can to stop construction of proposed new IGCC coal-fired electric power plants in Nevada. Reid wants Nevada utility companies to invest in solar energy, wind energy and geothermal energy instead of coal technologies. Reid stated that global warming is a reality, and just one proposed coal-fired plant would contribute to it by burning seven million tons of coal a year. The long-term healthcare costs would be far too high, he claimed (no source attributed). \\"I'm going to do everything I can to stop these plants.\\", he said. \\"There is no clean coal technology. There is cleaner coal technology, but there is no clean coal technology.\\" One of the most efficient ways to treat the H2S gas from an IGCC plant is by converting it into sulphuric acid in a wet gas sulphuric acid process WSA process. However, the majority of the H2S treating plants utilize the modified Claus process, as the sulphur market infrastructure and the transportation costs of sulphuric acid versus sulphur are in favour of sulphur production.

It is also known as the Book of Travels and was a work that shaped the future of classical Persian travel writing. It is an account of Khusraw's seven-year journey through the Islamic world.Institute of Ismaili Studies He initially set out on a Hajj, the obligatory Pilgrimage to Mecca. Departing on March 5, 1046, Khusraw took a less than direct route, heading north toward the Caspian Sea. Throughout his travels he kept a minutely detailed journal which clearly describes many facets of life in the Islamic world of the 11th Century. Nasir Khusraw compiled the Safarnama in a later period of his life, using notes that he had taken along his seven-year journey. His prose is straightforward, resembling a travelogue as opposed to his more poetic and philosophical Diwan. Khusraw begins his Safarnama with a description of himself, his life, and his monumental decision to travel to Mecca. He recounts an extraordinary dream in which he converses with a man who encourages him to seek out that which is beneficial to the intellect. Before the dream ends, the man allegedly points towards the qibla and says nothing more. This was the impetus that drove Khusraw to perform the hajj. In the remaining sections of the Safarnama, Khusraw describes cities and towns along the path of his journey, with particular focus on Mecca, Jerusalem, and Cairo (the capital of the Fatimid Caliphate at the time). Khusraw's work is appreciated for its detailed descriptions of these cities, with precise accounts of civic buildings and markets.

Tony and Noah talk briefly about Tony's favorite film The Public Enemy. Alone with him, Tony questions him about his ethnicity, and confirms that he is half Jewish and half African- American. Tony tells him that, being black, he must stay away from his daughter. Noah swears at him, and storms out. Tony goes to the kitchen; unwrapping some cold cuts he sees a box of Uncle Ben's Rice, triggering a panic attack. Tony has read the newspaper headline: \\"2nd Firebomb in Sanitation War\\". He confronts Ralphie Cifaretto, an ambitious and effective member of Richie Aprile's crew, and Albert Barese about the sanitation dispute. He tells them firmly: \\"No more fires.\\" So, instead, Ralphie has a man beaten up with baseball bats. Separately, Ray Curto meets his handler from the FBI; he is 'cooperating'. Tony visits his mother Livia in an attempt to set things straight, and tell her what to say if questioned about the stolen airline tickets. She seems to stonewall him. Exasperated, he walks out. That evening, Livia dies from a stroke. Later, Tony tells Dr. Melfi, \\"I'm glad she's dead.\\" Then he bursts out that he is \\"a bad son\\". Tony's sister Barbara informs him that Janice will not be coming for the funeral. He furiously calls her in Seattle and tells her to be on the next plane; she inveigles him into paying the fare. At the funeral home Janice insists that, contrary to her wishes, Livia be given a lavish funeral and, exasperated, Tony agrees. In Livia's house, Janice hammers at the basement wall. At the funeral, still at the graveside, she has a dispute with Livia's caregiver Svetlana about Livia's collection of records. Svetlana says Livia gave them to her; Janice orders her to give them back. At the post-funeral reception at the Sopranos' house Janice, against Tony's wishes, corrals everyone into the main room for a ceremony of remembrance. With some reluctance, one or two people speak in memory of Livia. Christopher, stoned on marijuana and cocaine, gives a rambling, unfocused speech. Tony has slipped outside, where he is confronted by an angry and drunk Artie Bucco, who remembers Livia telling him about Tony's torching of the Vesuvio. Artie goes back inside and seems ready to speak about it but Carmela, who has been drinking, suddenly says, \\"This is such a crock of shit.\\" She says that Livia was \\"terribly dysfunctional\\" and, \\"even from the grave\\" she \\"spread no cheer\\". Afterwards, Tony sits in front of the television with a drink and watches the scene from The Public Enemy in which the main character's mother joyfully prepares her home for her son's return. He gets teary. First appearances The episode marks the first appearance of: *Ralph Cifaretto: A high-ranking soldier in the former Aprile crew who pushes to be made captain of said crew. * Eugene Pontecorvo: A well- liked associate and soon-to-be made man in the Aprile crew. * Noah Tannenbaum: A half-black, half-Jewish college student and potential boyfriend of Meadow's. *Ronald Zellman: Assemblyman for Newark, New Jersey's Lower 8th Ward.

Dunwich is part of the Redland City local government area, administered from the bayside town of Cleveland on the Queensland mainland. In the , Dunwich had a population of 864 people. Dunwich is one of three towns on North Stradbroke Island - the others being Amity Point and Point Lookout. History Originally known as Goompi and then renamed Green Point by the European settlers, the first settlement at Dunwich was established in 1827 as pilot station and military post. It was supposed to be a good place to discharge cargo from visiting ships that traveled through the South Passage. However cargo was lost in bad weather and local Aboriginals were hostile so the post was disbanded in 1831. Dunwich was named after the Suffolk village of Dunwich near to the Stradbroke Estate by Sir Ralph Darling on 16 July 1827, in honour of the family title (Viscount Dunwich) of the Earl of Stradbroke, father of Captain Henry John Rous RN, commander of HMS Rainbow, which carried Governor Darling to Moreton Bay and surveyed the immediate Dunwich area. In 1892 a leper colony was established at Dunwich; later this facility was closed and the lepers moved to the Peel Island lazaret. A quarantine station opened in 1850, although this was eventually moved to the more isolated St Helena Island in Moreton Bay. The station was converted into a nursing home for the elderly and infirmed, one of Queensland's first such facilities. The home was moved to Sandgate in 1946. The main cemetery on the island (Dunwich Cemetery) is found in this small town and contains the graves of over 10,000 people, most of which are unmarked. Other small cemeteries were established for the indigenous community and the leper colony. Dunwich Post Office opened on 22 October 1896 (a receiving office had been open from 1885). In 1943, after the closure of the Myora Mission, some of the residents were moved to Dunwich; others went to One Mile. Some of the remaining buildings from the Dunwich Benevolent Asylum now form part of the North Stradbroke Island Historical Museum, located in Welsby Street, Dunwich. The Dunwich Convict Causeway also remains, although it has been expanded to accommodate modern ships. In the 2011 census, Dunwich had a population of 883 people. Heritage listings Dunwich has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Bingle Road: Dunwich Cemetery * Junner Street: Dunwich Convict Causeway * Junner Street: Dunwich Public Reserve * Junner Street: St Mark's Anglican Church and Dunwich Public Hall Amenties The Redland City Council operates a public library in Ballow Road.  Education  Dunwich State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Bingle Road (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 172 students with 14 teachers (11 full-time equivalent) and 14 non-teaching staff (9 full-time equivalent). The school includes a special education program. Transport Vehicular ferries which cross Moreton Bay link the mainland with North Stradbroke Island dock at Dunwich. Mining companies have also extensive barge docking and loading facilities at Dunwich. Demographics In the , Dunwich recorded a population of 883 people, 48.1% female and 51.9% male. The median age of the Dunwich population was 39 years, 2 years above the national median of 37. 86.2% of people living in Dunwich were born in Australia. The other top responses for country of birth were New Zealand 3.8%, England 2.4%, India 0.7%, France 0.6%, Germany 0.6%. 90.8% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 0.6% Indonesian, 0.5% Other Australian Indigenous Languages, nec, 0.5% German, 0.5% Yumplatok (Torres Strait Creole).

R. R. Tolkien's 1937 children's fantasy novel of the same name. The series was adapted by Michael Kilgarriff and produced by John Powell in eight half-hour mono episodes for BBC Radio 4 broadcast from September 29 to November 17 at 8.30pm. Story The radio series follows the plot of the original novel (revised 1951 version) very closely, except for the addition of The Tale Bearer, a narrator whose account of the story is often interrupted and embellished by the protagonist Bilbo Baggins in the role of secondary narrator. Bilbo is approached by the wizard Gandalf to undertake a dangerous adventure, and despite his initial reluctance he soon finds himself accompanying Thorin Oakenshield and his party of dwarves on a long and difficult quest to recover the dwarves' treasure from Smaug the dragon. On the way, he encounters trolls, goblins and giant spiders, and finds a magic ring with the power of invisibility. Production The show's production was complicated by the inclusion of multiple sound effects (often inserted live while recording the actors' performances), songs from the novel, and special sounds and electronic voice treatments created by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. All of the trolls, goblins, Elves, Wargs and Eagles have treated voices, as does Gandalf when imitating the trolls. Influences from The Lord of the Rings Although the script is closely based on the original novel, Kilgariff incorporates a few names and phrases from The Lord of the Rings that did not originally appear in The Hobbit. *In an early scene at Bag End, Gandalf originally tells Bilbo, \\"Great elephants, you're not at all yourself today\\". In the radio version this is changed to \\"Great oliphaunts\\", the form used in The Lord of the Rings. *At the beginning of the Battle of Five Armies Gandalf says, \\"Upon victory depends not just the treasure, nor only our lives, but the whole future and well-being of Middle-earth\\". The name Middle-earth is not used at all in the original novel. Indeed, Tolkien had not written The Hobbit as taking place in Middle-earth, as he had been writing The Silmarillion for some time, and wrote The Hobbit separately. *During the battle, the Elvenking says his name, Thranduil, as a battle-cry. *In the same battle Thorin utters the Dwarves' battle-cry, \\"Baruk Khaz√¢d! Khaz√¢d aim√™nu!\\" *Near the end, when Balin and Gandalf are visiting Bilbo, Balin tells Gandalf that Bilbo seems to be writing his memoirs, to which Gandalf replies, \\"Well he'll never get a publisher\\". The script retains almost all of the book's differences and inconsistencies from Tolkien's other works. Wiping and recovery The original master tapes for the series seem to have been wiped in the 1970s. The reason is not clear, although it was rumoured to be due to a dispute with the Tolkien estate (if so, the subsequent recovery and commercial issue of the series would suggest that the dispute was resolved). The BBC eventually recovered the series from a domestic off-air FM recording, apparently comprising 90- and 60-minute compilations edited together from the original episodes. The sound quality of these recordings is clear and legible, though it is noticeably inferior to a studio-quality recording and exhibits prominent tape hiss. For broadcast and home audio purposes the BBC re-edited these compilations back into half-hour episodes, adding a brief snatch of the theme tune at the beginning and end of each. The title The Hobbit is spoken only at the beginning of the first episode and there are no opening or closing credits. Audio release and reference There have been several home audio releases of the series on cassette and CD.

Fighting As part of the British Expeditionary Force's (BEF) retreat to Dunkirk, the 144th Infantry Brigade of the 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division was holding the road that runs southward from Bergues through Wormhoudt, Cassel and Hazebrouck to delay the German advance. British troops at Wormhoudt were overrun by advancing German forces. Having exhausted their ammunition supplies, the soldiers surrendered to the SS troops assuming that they would be taken prisoner according to the Geneva Convention. Massacre After their surrender, a large group of soldiers from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment, 4th Battalion Cheshire Regiment, and gunners of the 210 Battery, 53rd (The Worcestershire Yeomanry) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery as well as French soldiers in charge of a military depot were taken to a barn in La Plaine au Bois near Wormhout and Esquelbecq on 28 May 1940. The Allied troops had become increasingly alarmed at the brutal conduct of the SS soldiers en route to the barn, which included the shooting of a number of wounded stragglers. On arrival at the barn the most senior British officer in the group, Captain James Lynn-Allen, protested, but was immediately rebuked by an SS soldier. When there were nearly 100 men inside the small barn, soldiers from the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, threw stick-grenades into the building, killing many POWs, including Charles Orton, a captain in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. The grenades failed to kill everyone, largely due to the bravery of two British NCOs, Sergeant Stanley Moore and CSM Augustus Jennings, who hurled themselves on top of the grenades using their bodies to suppress the force of the explosion and shield their comrades from the blast.\\"The Battle and Massacre of Wormhout - 28th May 1940\\" with photos, WW2Talk, March 5, 2010. Retrieved August 8, 2015. Upon realising this, the SS called for two groups of five to come out. The first five consisted of Pte Arthur Johnson and Private Bennett. The men came out and were shot. Despite being shot, Private Johnson and Gunner Brian Fahey survived, unknown to the SS men at the time. Concluding that these methods were too slow, the SS troopers simply fired into the barn with their weapons. Several British prisoners were able to escape, while a few others, like Fahey, were left for dead. Captain Lynn-Allen died while trying to escape, although he enabled Private Bert Evans to escape; Evans was the last survivor of the massacre.Olga Craig, \\"Wormhoudt: 'Every day I thank God we did our duty'\\", The Telegraph, May 23, 2010. Retrieved August 8, 2015.\\"Last survivor of Second World War massacre dies\\", ITV News, October 11, 2013. Retrieved August 8, 2015. A total of 80 men were killed. While 15 more were wounded, their wounds were so severe that within 48 hours all but six of them had died.Jim Black, \\"Brian Fahey: Composer, big band arranger and director\\", The Guardian, August 2, 2007. Retrieved September 19, 2016. After a couple of days, Johnson and Fahey and several others were found by regular German Army medics and taken to hospital. Their wounds were treated before they were sent to prisoner of war camps in occupied Europe. Legacy The Waffen-SS division, Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler was under the overall command of Oberstgruppenf√ºhrer Sepp Dietrich. It was alleged from post-war testimony that it was specifically soldiers of the 2nd Battalion under the command of then Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Wilhelm Mohnke that carried out the atrocity. However, Mohnke never had to face a trial for any alleged part in the war crimes based on these hors de combat killings. Mohnke strongly denied the accusations against him, telling historian Thomas Fischer, \\"I issued no orders not to take English prisoners or to execute prisoners.\\" Mohnke died in August 2001. In 1947, a number of survivors of the massacre returned to the scene accompanied by officials from the War Crimes Interrogation Unit, following investigations undertaken by the office of the Judge Advocate General. It proved impossible to construct a sufficiently strong case to bring prosecutions. A number of alleged key witnesses were reported to have died on the Eastern Front, while others invoked the \\"SS oath\\" and refused to talk. In 1988, after a campaign by British MP Jeff Rooker, the case was reopened but a German prosecutor came to the conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to bring charges. The incident was re-enacted in the 2004 BBC television docudrama Dunkirk. The 2004 German film Downfall was criticized by author Giles MacDonogh upon release for its sympathetic portrayal of Mohnke, who many hold directly or indirectly responsible for the massacre.Eberle, Henrik, MacDonogh, Giles and Uhl, Matthias.

The song tells the true story of Billy Gibbons and his friend R.K. Bullock who with a workman, welded together a steel ball cage with a seat and seatbelt fitted inside. They placed the cage into the bed of a truck and at night, after reaching a speed of , on Highway 6 near Houston (also known as Jack Rabbit Road), rolled the cage out the back with the hapless narrator and friend taking a ride inside. The cage generated a tail of sparks on the road but in its crushed condition stopped rolling. Still moving at high speed, the now egg shaped cage crashed into a fence. Both occupants survived relatively unscathed and were awarded the title \\"Master of Sparks\\" by the cheering crowd. From the Sounds interview: \\"Yeah, that's a true story,\\" Billy drawls obviously relishing the opportunity to spin another well- worn time-honoured tale.\\" \\"I guess it's safe to talk about it now ... A good friend and I put our heads together one day and went out of town to his folks spread where we got the help of the black foreman there to weld a bunch of sucker gauge which is the kind of pipe they use to build windmills, into a steel cage, a ball of sorts. We put a door on it, a seatbelt on a bucket seat. It even had shock absorbers to cushion the points of impact. Then we'd get drunk and roll this thing out of the back of a pick-up truck at 'bout fifty miles an hour and when it would hit the ground it'd send up a rooster tail of sparks a hundred feet in the air. Man it would tear you up to get in that thing. It was the most amazing spectacle I'd ever laid eyes on.\\" \\"'Course we kept it a secret from everybody 'cause, if our folks had found out, we'd all been off to military school, but then my buddy went and printed up flyers and distributed them at school sayin' to come and see the 'master of sparks' that night on jack-rabbit road which was Highway Six, our launch pad.\\" \\"Well, sure enough, come sundown we got out there to find both sides of the road lined with cars waitin' to see this. Some guy even had the back end of his pick-up truck loaded down with ice and cold beer, he was givin' away free beer. So, after realizing what was coming down, both of us loaded ourselves in for the last ride and I guess we must of been going sixty miles an hour, drunk, laughin' like hell and, when we rolled ourselves out, we hit the ground so hard it squashed the ball out like an egg. Needless to say, it didn't roll too well and we spun off the road and hit a fence, tore bout a hundred yards of barbed wire down. I was screamin', he was bleedin', but, needless to say we were awarded the coveted title of having done the wildest thing.\\" Personnel *Billy Gibbons ‚Äì guitar, vocals *Dusty Hill ‚Äì bass *Frank Beard ‚Äì drums References External links * Category:ZZ Top songs Category:Songs written by Billy Gibbons Category:1973 songs ","title":"Master of Sparks"},{"id":"4538193","text":"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Vol. 1 is a compilation album by Powerman 5000, released in 2004.

He flourished about 1420. He was born at Lynn in Norfolk, and studied philosophy and theology at Cambridge with much credit, taking the degree of Doctor of Divinity there. He afterwards returned to his native place, where he entered the order of the Carmelites, and spent the rest of his life. He died in Norwich, where he had lived for many years. Alan of Lynn was a most laborious writer, and left a multitude of books that were the fruits of his pen; but they seem to have been more remarkable for their number, than for any interest they are at present calculated to excite on the part of lay readers.A long list will be found in Thomas Tanner, Bibliotheca Britannico-Hibernica. He followed the taste which was common in his age, of expounding scripture allegorically; but he has been praised for his general method of treating theological subjects, and particularly for his diligence in making indexes. Alan de Lynn was much distinguished among his contemporaries for his talent in preaching, and was a friend or spiritual intimate of the mystic and controversialist Margery Kempe of Lynn.

It was hosted by Mark DeCarlo and packaged by Stone-Stanley Productions, with swing group Big Bad Voodoo Daddy as the house band. Due to low ratings, it only lasted six episodes (only three of which were seen in their entirety by East Coast viewers, due to NFL doubleheaders). It was announced in TV Guide that the series would return for spring 1997, in a half-hour format with Heidi Mark joining DeCarlo as co-host, but ultimately didn't return to the schedule. Format The show's format followed that of Let's Make a Deal; however, stunts similar to those featured on Truth or Consequences were also played. Some of these stunts were played in order to earn a smaller prize, which could then be gambled for an unknown behind a curtain or a box, and other stunts awarded different prizes based on how well (or how poorly) the contestant performed. Some of the games played involved the contestants participating in the studio itself: * A contestant was hooked to a giant \\"skill crane\\" and given the appropriate oversized grabbers, with which he had to retrieve large teddy bears while being raised and lowered by his partner. Each bear represented a money amount or a prize, and the contestant could retrieve as many or as few of the bears as he or she wanted. However, one bear had a human inside of it, and attempting to grab this bear would \\"scare\\" it, the bear would run away, and the couple received nothing. * Contestants had to listen to a popular song being sung by a fat lady, a Wagnerian Valkyrie performed by Anne-Marie Bosche' Clinkenbeard, (and thus butchered from its original form); guessing the song correctly won a prize. * A contestant was positioned on top of a small \\"building', and a chimpanzee was placed on an identical \\"building\\" in a \\"man vs. monkey\\" game. In a tribute to King Kong, the man raced the chimp to swat toy airplanes out of the \\"sky\\" (actually suspended from modified ceiling fans that rotated). Beating the monkey won the prize. * Couples raced to launch small teddy bears at a spiked wall with a slingshot; the couple \\"killing\\" the most bears won a prize. * DeCarlo once asked if anyone in the studio audience wanted to \\"kill\\" the show's enormous frog mascot (actually a large prop built onstage in the stunt area). Then he selected someone from the audience, who had 30 seconds to shovel pennies onto a scale. After the time ran out, the player had the option of either taking a bribe or seeing if he had shoveled at least 200 pounds of pennies onto the scale. Success meant that the player won a grand prize, plus as much money as shoveled onto the scale. Whether the player took the bribe or played for the grand prize, if there was at least 200 pounds of pennies on the scale, a giant anvil was dropped onto the frog. Notable to many of these stunts was the overt destruction by the contestant to his own property in an attempt to win a better prize. Examples of such stunts included: :* Throwing baseballs at the windows of one's house in order to win new furnishings (and new windows) for the home; :* Destroying one's own automobile with a sledgehammer ‚Äì if the car was judged by an insurance appraiser ‚Äì (Tim Davis from SCA Appraisal Company) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6JTBxQTMN0 to be totaled, the contestant won a brand new car; :* Dropping one's own possessions (such as TV's, golf clubs, etc.) off of a crane onto a giant tic-tac-toe board; getting three in a row won a larger prize package. While DeCarlo played up the fact that losing one of these games resulted in nothing more than a tragic loss, a disclaimer at the end of every episode stated that contestants who damaged their own possessions would be reimbursed money according to the value of their belongings before they were destroyed. The Big Deal of the evening was played like earlier versions of Let's Make a Deal. DeCarlo would go back into the audience and invite contestants who had won something to trade their prize(s) in for a shot at the Big Deal, starting with the top winner and working downward. After two players were selected, they were presented with three large screens, one of which contained the Big Deal, a prize package usually worth more than any other prize offered that day. The top winner got first selection, and the contents of each of the three screens were revealed, usually in ascending order. Proposed revival In 1998, Buena Vista Television (Now Disney-ABC Television Group) wanted to revive Let's Make a Deal with Gordon Elliot as host where it was targeted for syndication in the Fall 1999 season but it has been backfired since then.

The label released music by Falling Forward, Boysetsfire and Ink & Dagger, and created the annual weekend long music festival, Krazy Fest. History Initial was founded in 1992 in a Dunkin' Donuts in suburban Detroit by three high school friends, Dennis Hepinstall, Carolyn Smith and Andy Rich. Their first issue was a re-release of the 7\\" single from local Detroit based hardcore band Pittbull. Carolyn's interest waned early in the project after her long standing relationship with Dennis ended and she bowed out. Dennis would stick around for another few years while Andy attended the Haworth College of Business at Western Michigan University. By 1995 Dennis had enough and ended his tenure with the label as well. After graduating college with a bachelor of business administration in 1996 Andy relocated to Louisville, KY and took the label with him. Over the next few years Initial would blossom into one of independent music's most well known labels. The April 1998 issue of Playboy magazine declared Initial one of the country's ten hottest record labels. The May 1998 issue of Alternative Press magazine named Initial as one of \\"Ten independent labels that have helped to change not only the way hardcore sounds, but the way it does business.\\" Krazy Fest Krazy Fest was founded by Initial Records President Andy Rich. It was a weekend long music and lifestyle festival that ran annually for six years from 1998 through 2003, with a reprisal in 2011 at Expo5. Over the years Krazy Fest featured such bands as Dashboard Confessional, AFI, Jimmy Eat World, Alkaline Trio, and The Dillinger Escape Plan. Final release Initial's last release to date was a posthumous CD from Louisville hardcore band By The Grace Of God in 2004. It was a benefit to help pay medical bills for local Louisville scenester Adele Collins. The band also played a reunion show in conjunction with the release.

Whitman School of Management is the business school of Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York. Named after Martin J. Whitman, an alumnus and benefactor of the school, the school was established in 1919. The Whitman School offers bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees, as well as executive degree programs.  History  The school was established at Syracuse University in 1919 as the College of Business Administration. By 1920, the school was the 16th school in the United States to receive accreditation from Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). In 1948, the MBA program was established as the Army Comptrollership Program; the Army Comptrollership Program was established in 1952; and the doctoral program was created in 1965. The Whitman school has been a leader in education innovation and began offering a distance MBA in 1977. After a major donation from 1949 graduate Martin J. Whitman, founder of Third Avenue Management, and Lois Whitman in June 2003, a new 160,000-square-foot state-of-the-art building was constructed and the university renamed the School of Management after him. Degree programs Undergraduate programs The Whitman School has several areas of academic study for leading business training and career development. Students can major in one of eight four-year programs, with the option to double-major within the Whitman School or fulfill a dual-major program with another school or college at Syracuse University.  Majors  Whitman students can choose their field of study from eight different four-year programs. They can also double-major within the Whitman School.

It is a historic company town established by the Leyden Coal Company in 1902 to house the miners of the Leyden Coal Mine nearby to the west. History The town of Leyden consists of a collection of square frame homes with pyramidal roofs that were originally red trimmed in white. It was named for pioneer miner brothers Michael, Martin and John Leyden, who discovered the original Leyden mine in the hogback ridge to the west, where Michael and Martin died in 1866 and 1870, respectively. At its height, the town of Leyden included these homes as well as the company store, school, boarding house, saloon, and Presbyterian chapel. The store still stands at the southeast corner of 82nd and Quaker, while the school is the easternmost house on the hillside to the north, and the foreman's house stands next door to its west. The town housed a diverse population of native and immigrant miners, including from such countries as Austria, Hungary, Greece, Germany, Brazil, Italy, Mexico, and more. Major events in its history include the Leyden Mine Disaster in 1910 which claimed 10 lives, and the workers' strike of 1914 Leyden ceased to be a company town around 1951 when the mine ceased operation. The town site was sold to investors and then the company town houses were sold to individual homeowners. Leyden has remained an unincorporated community with its own water district ever since. Leyden Coal Mine The Leyden Coal Mine was operated by the Leyden Coal Company. Between 1903 and 1950 it produced about 6 Mt of sub- bituminous coal. The mine consisted of four shafts providing the access to two flat-lying coal seams from 240 to 260 m (790 to 855 ft) below the surface in the Late Cretaceous Laramie Formation. It was a room and pillar operation with an estimated recovery of about 35%. The coal was used in the Denver area and beyond, as well as by the Denver Tramway that was a subsidiary of railroad magnate David Moffat. In 1961, the Public Service Company of Colorado, a subsidiary of Xcel Energy, established the Leyden Gas Storage Operation which used the abandoned mine to store natural gas but gas storage ceased after 2000 due to concerns about leakage. In 2004 the City of Arvada began injecting water and using the abandoned mine as a subsurface water reservoir.Davis, K., Li, Y., Batzle, M. and Reynolds, B., 2005.

These large scale mobilizations are widely seen as a historic turn point in Latino politics, especially Latino immigrant civic participation and political influence, as noted in a range of scholarly publications in this field. The protests began in response to proposed legislation known as H.R. 4437, which would raise penalties for illegal immigration and classify undocumented immigrants and anyone who helped them enter or remain in the US as felons. As part of the wider immigration debate, most of the protests not only sought a rejection of this bill, but also a comprehensive reform of the country's immigration laws that included a path to citizenship for all undocumented immigrants. The 2006 immigration protests were a series of demonstrations that began in Chicago and continued throughout major cities nationwide for a period of eight weeks. The first major demonstration in Chicago was held on March 10, 2006, and was estimated to have about 100,000 participants. It was the initial impetus for many of the other protests which followed throughout the country. The largest single protest occurred on March 25, 2006 in downtown Los Angeles with an official estimate of more than 500,000 people marching in what organizers called \\"La Gran Marcha\\" (\\"The Great March\\") . Organizers of La Gran Marcha, however, state that the actual revised number of participants is somewhere between 1.25 and 1.5 million estimated through later photographic analysis. The largest nationwide day of protest occurred on April 10, 2006, in 102 cities across the country, with 350,000‚Äì500,000 in Dallas. Most of the protests were peaceful and attracted considerable media attention. Additional protests took place on May Day.  May Day  San Jose, California. The marches reached a climax on May 1, 2006 and were nicknamed \\"A day without Immigrants.\\" Naming the protests in such way encouraged immigrants to quit their daily labor-intensive jobs for a day to draw attention to their significant contributions to U.S. daily life. Latino immigrants across the country were urged to boycott work, school and other economic activities. Those outside the Latino community were shocked to see the growing workforce of janitors, nannies, restaurant workers and many other service workers leave their underrepresented and under appreciated jobs to join the protests.Dawn Garcia, \\"Spanish-Language and Digital Media: A New Counterpublic Sphere In California.\\" Tangents: The Journal of the Master of Liberal Arts Program at Stanford University Volume 8 (2009): 9. The mobilization of working-class undocumented immigrants challenged the belief that the United States would be able to prosper without undocumented immigrants. The protests took place on May 1, a date meant to honor workers throughout the country. The May 1st marches reflected the immigrant protesters' identities as workers and significant contributors to U.S. society. Most immigrants of Latin American descent come to the United States seeking economic prosperity for themselves and their families,Laura Pulido, \\"A Day Without Immigrants: The Racial and Class Politics of Immigrant Exclusion.\\" Antipode 39, no. 1 (2007): 7. they infrequently accept low wage jobs to survive in the United States. Therefore, missing work for a day burdened their families. Yet, thousands of immigrants risked their jobs and joined the marches to demand political recognition.  Illegal immigration  Mexicans were not considered \\"immigrants\\" until 1960, when the United States issued visas to emigrate to America. Before 1960, Mexicans could only apply for work visas as Braceros or cross the border without inspection. Mexicans didn't have a \\"legal\\" way to enter the United States before then.https://www.history.com/news/the-birth-of-illegal-immigration To understand the 2006 immigrant protests and the discourse behind illegal immigration as a leading topic in U.S. political debate, it is necessary to understand the history of illegal immigration. Since the 19th century, mass illegal immigration from Latin America to the United States has greatly impacted Latino politics. Illegal immigrants are individuals who arrive and live in the United States without legal documentation. In many cases, individuals arrive to the United States with legal documentation such as tourist or student visas and overstay the amount of time they are allowed to remain in the United States, thus becoming illegal immigrants. Many others cross the borders between the United States and Mexico, or the United States and Canada, without legal documentation. Today, undocumented entry to the United States is a misdemeanor. Illegal immigration did not always exist to the extent that it does today. Before 1965, the United States did not have numerical restrictions on immigration from countries in the western hemisphere. In 1965, the United States passed the Immigration Nationality Act and repealed the 1924 National Origins Act designed to limit migration from southern and eastern European countries, thus making it possible for eastern- hemisphere countries to have equal access to visas in addition and consequently restricting migration from the western hemisphere for the first time. Furthermore, the 1965 Act provided unlimited number of visas for family reunification because it allowed naturalized U.S. citizens and permanent residents to request permission to bring their family members to the United States. The 1965 Act influenced Latinos/as citizens and permanent residents to request visas that allowed their family members to immigrate to the United States. This resulted in a shift of the country's ethno racial makeup and the creation of a large Latino population in the United States. The 1965 Act's restriction on the number of visas allotted to western hemisphere countries created the phenomenon of large scale illegal western hemisphere migration, particularly from Latin American countries like Mexico. In the 1980s, the United States government began to express concern about the large scale flow of illegal immigration, which led to the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986. First, the Act made it illegal for employers to hire workers who could not provide proof of legal immigration to the United States. Second, it allowed for the legalization of immigrants who could prove residency in the U.S. since January 1, 1982 and agricultural workers who began working in the United States prior to May 1986. Out of the 3 million migrants that applied for IRCA, 2.7 million, many of whom were Mexican, were given a path to citizenship. However, in the long term, IRCA was not successful in reducing the flow of illegal immigration to the United States. As a result, the U.S. government began to increase the funding of Border Patrol as a means to regulate the flow of undocumented immigrants to the United States. These actions proved to have little impact on illegal immigration, resulting in about eleven million illegal immigrants living in the United States, the majority being of Mexican origin. Therefore, discourse about the flow of illegal immigration has been known as a \\"Mexican\\" or \\"Latino\\" problem. The large scale flow of illegal migrants and the significant ethno-racial shift that occurred as a result of 1965 Act, have resulted in anti-immigrant backlash that targets Latino immigrants. Role of Spanish-language media and religious leaders  Spanish-language media outlets, in particular Univision, Telemundo, Azteca Am√©rica and La Opini√≥n (Los Angeles' largest Spanish newspaper), advertised the protests on their front page. They called it a \\"Mega Marcha\\", a mega march, as a way to emphasize the large scale of the marches. This strategy allowed for the spread of mobilizations throughout the country. KMEX- TV in Los Angeles, an Univision owned and operated television station, called the protests \\"Pisando Firme\\", stepping strong, to remind protesters to march \\"with pride, with dignity, with order, for your children, for your people, for your community.\\" Although television and newspapers effectively mobilized protesters, it was radio stations which truly promoted the protests. Various Spanish-language radio stations across the country, in large part aided in mobilizing people for the protests. Eddie \\"Piol√≠n\\" Sotelo, a Spanish-language radio personality from Los Angeles, persuaded eleven of his counterparts from Spanish-language radio stations based in Los Angeles to also rally listeners to attend planned protests.Melissa Block, \\"Spanish D.J. Organizes Immigration-Reform Protests\\" NPR All Things Considered March 28, 2006\\"Immigration Protests, Part 1: Spanish-Language Media\\" NPR Day to Day April 7, 2006 Piolin Por La Ma√±ana, is known to be one of the most popular radio shows in the country. The Piol√≠n's radio show, recorded near Los Angeles, is broadcast in 47 markets across the country including Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Miami, Phoenix, San Francisco and New York, many of the cities where the protests took place.Dawn Garcia, \\"Spanish-Language and Digital Media: A New Counterpublic Sphere In California.\\" Tangents: The Journal of the Master of Liberal Arts Program at Stanford University Volume 8 (2009): 10. In addition to mobilizing thousands of immigrant protestors, Eddie \\"Piolin\\" Sotelo made multiple appearances during protests, which increased his moral authority towards his Latino audience. Religious leader Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, from the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, showed his support of immigrant protesters and urged Catholics, many of whom are Latino, to support the protests. He urged the Catholic community to spend Lent fasting and praying for an immigration reform that would counteract HR-4437 and the criminalization of immigrants. Cardinal Mahony made an official statement against HR-4437 through which he instructed Catholic priests to defy any law that required them to ask immigrants for legal documents.Leo R. Chavez, \\"The Immigrant Marches of 2006 and The Struggle for Inclusion\\", in The Latino Threat: Constructing Immigrants, Citizens, and The Nation. Second ed. (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2013). 159. He stated that immigration was not about politics, rather the way in which human beings treat one another, while asserting that all Americans are of immigrant ancestry and share universal citizenship. It was not media alone that mobilized protesters, rather the media in partnership with migrant organizations and leaders.David Ayon, \\"Migrant Organization and Mexican Policy\\" (Conference Speech, A Lehman- Cuny Sponsored Invitational Conference, Manhattan, October 20, 2006). 46. When analyzing the immigrant civic participation in the 2006 protests simply acknowledging the media's influence is not enough. It absolutely necessary to understand the \\"meta-network\\" of activists and leaders that used media as a call to action.  Controversy and backlash over flag symbolism and protests  The initial protests caused much controversy after some protesters waved Mexican and Central American flags instead of American flags. Various talk- radio hosts and columnists played up the contentious nature of displaying non-U.S. flags during the protests. One particular incident referred to involved a protest at Montebello High School in California, where a Mexican flag was raised on a flagpole over a United States flag flying in the distressed (or upside-down) position.Student punished for American flag incident by Tracy Garcia, Whittier Daily News, April 1, 2006, and \\"The American Flag Comes Second\\" by Michelle Malkin, posted March 29, 2006 01:15 AM. Both accessed April 14, 2006. As part of the backlash over the protests and the controversy over the flag symbolism issue, a group calling themselves \\"Border Guardians\\" burned a Mexican flag in front of the Mexican Consulate in Tucson, Arizona, on April 9, 2006.\\"Mexico says U.S. group burning Mexican flag is unacceptable\\" KVOA TV, Tucson, Arizona, April 11, 2006. Retrieved April 14, 2006. The following day the group proceeded to burn two Mexican flags during protest in Tucson which was estimated to have had 15,000 participants. After the police seized a student who had thrown a water bottle at the \\"Border Guardians\\", they followed the police officers calling for them to let the student go. As the situation escalated violence broke out and 6 were arrested with dozens being pepper-sprayed. The next day the police arrested the leader of the Border Guardians, Roy Warden, for charges including assault and starting a fire in a public park. Because of the controversy, organizers of the protests encouraged protesters to leave their Mexican flags at home, with Cardinal Roger Mahony telling Los Angeles protesters to not fly any flag other than the United States flag because, \\"...they do not help us get the legislation we need.\\"\\"Protesters work to change image\\" by Peter Prengaman, Associated Press, Long Beach Press-Telegram, April 11, 2006. Retrieved April 14, 2006. As a result of this controversy later protests featured fewer Mexican flags and more protesters carrying American flags. In addition, California's Oceanside Unified School District banned flags and signs from its campuses after \\"Mexican flag-wavers clashed with U.S. flag-wavers.\\" Backlash The Washington Post reported that, in the Washington, D.C. suburb of Herndon, a day labor center at which suspected undocumented immigrants gathered was closed and its mayor and two aldermen lost reelection, in part due to immigration concerns. Membership in the Minuteman Project increased due in part to backlash from the protests. On May 3, responding to the May 1 boycotts, the Minutemen embarked on a caravan across the United States in an effort to bring attention to a perceived need for border enforcement. The caravan was expected to reach Washington, D.C. on May 12. Regarding the Tucson-based anti-immigration movement: In 2006, the Southern Poverty Law Center wrote: \\"Roy Warden, 59, emerged this spring as one of the country's most controversial, volatile, and, many believe, dangerous characters of the anti-immigration movement.\\"  Consequences of the 2006 immigration protests  Although HR-4437 failed to pass through the Senate, it left a trail of consequences that affected the immigrant community. One of those consequences was intensive Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids during the final years of the Bush administration which continued throughout the Obama presidency. The increase in Immigration Customs Enforcement raids was meant to suppress further immigrant organizing.Kim Voss and Irene Bloemraad, Rallying For Immigrant Rights: The Fight For Inclusion In 21st Century America (Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 2011). 35. In the next couple of years, more than 300,000 undocumented immigrant were deported to their home countries, that is 100,000 more than the number of deported immigrants in 2005, a year before the protests. The increase in deportations caused fear of retaliation within the undocumented community and resulted in rapid demobilization. Although HR-4437 did not become a law at the federal level, it did not prevent individual states from passing similar laws. In 2006, Pennsylvania passed the Illegal Immigration Relief Act, which fined landlords who rented housing to undocumented immigrants and also fined business owners who hired them. The State of Arizona passed S.B. 1070, which led to racial profiling and required police officers to request legal documentation from anyone they suspected was undocumented. Both laws, along with similar others, were deemed unconstitutional in part because the U.S. Constitution assigns control over immigration to the federal government, not individual states.Kim Voss and Irene Bloemraad, Rallying For Immigrant Rights: The Fight For Inclusion In 21st Century America (Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 2011). x.  Latino political contributions and civic engagement  Since undocumented immigrant communities were unable to vote, lobby, or influence politicians in more traditional ways, Latino leaders mobilized immigrants through non-voting activities, such as protests. Many Latinos indicated that the marches were the beginning of a new social and political movement that sought to gain civic empowerment. A report released by the Pew Hispanic Center indicated that Latinos would most likely vote in subsequent elections and The National Immigration Forum found that Latino voters were more enthusiastic to vote in 2006 due to the immigration debate, and the need to prevent legislation like HR-4437 from being approved by Congress. \\"Today we march, tomorrow we vote,\\" was one of the most popular slogans during the 2006 immigrant protests. Such slogan indicated the value and need for Latino/a political contribution and recognition.

The bill eventually failed and was never enacted. Legislation H.R. 4437 (The Border Protection, Anti terrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005) was passed by the United States House of Representatives on December 16, 2005 by a vote of 239 to 182. It is also known as the \\"Sensenbrenner Bill\\", for its sponsor in the House of Representatives, Jim Sensenbrenner. H.R. 4437 was seen by many as the catalyst for the 2006 U.S. immigration reform protests. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 previously gave \\"amnesty\\" to 2.7 million undocumented immigrants. Proponents of the measure, including then-President Reagan, said the measure, paired with stricter employer rules and a better path for legal entry, would reduce illegal immigration. The companion bill passed by the United States Senate was S. 2611, which never passed conference committee. The House Republican leadership stated that it rejected S. 2611 wholly and would only pass legislation that addressed border security. The end of the 109th Congress marked the death of this bill. Kennedy ruling The USA Supreme Court on June 16, 2008, ruled in Dada v. Mukasey, per ponente Justice Kennedy ruled (5‚Äì4) \\"that someone who is here illegally may withdraw his voluntarily agreement to depart and continue to try to get approval to remain in the United States.\\" The Court held that complying with a deportation order did not strip an immigrant of the right to appeal that deportation order.See Dada v. Mukasey, 554 U.S. 1 (2008) The lawsuit is about 2 seemingly contradictory provisions of immigration law. One prevents deportation by voluntary departure from the country. The other section allows immigrants who are here illegally but whose circumstances have changed to build their case to immigration officials, and who must remain in the US. In the case, Samson Dada, a Nigerian citizen, overstayed beyond the expiration of his tourist visa in 1998. Immigration authorities ordered him to leave the country as he agreed to leave voluntarily, but to allow his legal re-entry, unlike if he had been deported.supremecourt.gov, Dada vs. Mukasey, No 06-1181, June 16, 2008 ap.google.com, Top court eases rules for foreigners to try to stay in US  Organizations  The following organizations mobilized from hundreds (FAIR) to millions of people (Great American Boycott) around immigration reform in the United States during 2006. * May 1, 2006 'A Day Without Immigrant' National Mobilization Endorsers' ‚Äì national coalition of 215 organizations that mobilized one million protesters across the U.S. on May 1, 2006 for the Great American Boycott. * We Are America Alliance ‚Äì national network of hundreds of regional coalitions that mobilized 2 million protesters across the U.S. on April 10, 2006 and coordinated protests in the May 1 national protests * El Paro and the Day Without and Immigrant Coalition (Philadelphia Region) Philadelphia regional coalition of dozens of organizations invited and mobilized thousands of protesters in 7 marches from February 14 to April 10, 2006. * Kentucky Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights ‚Äì Kentucky coalition that mobilized an estimated 10,000 people in downtown Lexington, Kentucky on April 10, 2006 with other mobilizations around the state. * March 25 Coalition ‚Äì Southern California-based coalition that mobilized 750,000 protesters in Los Angeles on March 25, 2006 * Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) ‚Äì mobilized dozens of people in various counter- protests * Minuteman Project ‚Äì held sporadic counter-protests in some major US cities Recruiting methods Typically anti-illegal immigration movements focus on grassroots recruiting tactics; the Minutemen Civil Defense Corps and Minuteman Project use these methods to boost membership.

Cooperation between anti-illegal immigration groups Anti- illegal immigration groups often do not pursue the same agenda in the same ways; however, they do form coalitions when their agendas match other movements. One of the major joint efforts that these groups engage in is access to mailing lists for individuals who have donated money in the past to support the movement; Federation for American Immigration Reform and Minutemen Civil Defense Corps have shared lists of mailers with one another in recent years.

It is the largest particle accelerator in the Southern Hemisphere. ANSTO's Australian Synchrotron is a light source facility (in contrast to a collider), which uses particle accelerators to produce a beam of high energy electrons that are boosted to nearly the speed of light and directed into a storage ring where they circulate for many hours. As the path of these electrons are deflected in the storage ring by either bending magnets or insertion devices, they emit synchrotron light. The light is channelled to experimental endstations containing specialised equipment, enabling a range of research applications including high resolution imagery that is not possible under normal laboratory conditions. ANSTO's Australian Synchrotron supports the research needs of Australia's major universities and research centres, and businesses ranging from small-to-medium enterprises to multinational companies. During 2014-15 the Australian Synchrotron supported more than 4,300 researcher visits and close to 1,000 experiments in areas such as medicine, agriculture, environment, defence, transport, advanced manufacturing and mining. In 2015, the Australian Government announced a ten- year, million investment in operations through ANSTO, Australia's Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation .Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation In 2020, it was used to help map the molecular structure of the COVID-19 virus, during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  Accelerator systems  The interior of the Australian Synchrotron facility in 2006 before the beamlines were installed. Dominating the image is the storage ring, with an experimental endstation at front right. In the middle of the storage ring is the booster ring and linac. Electron gun The electrons used to provide the synchrotron light are first produced at the electron gun, by thermionic emission from a heated metal cathode. The emitted electrons are then accelerated to an energy of 90 keV (kilo-electron volts) by a 90 kilovolt potential applied across the gun and make their way into the linear accelerator. Linear accelerator The linear accelerator (or linac) uses a series of RF cavities, operating at a frequency of 3 GHz, to accelerate the electron beam to an energy of 100 MeV, over a distance of around 15 metres. Due to the nature of this acceleration, the beam must be separated into discrete packets, or 'bunches'. The bunching process is done at the start of the linac, using several 'bunching' cavities. The linac can accelerate a beam once every second. Further along the linac quadrupole magnets are used to help focus the electron beam. linac is visible at image right extending from the electron gun at the far wall, and joining into the booster ring seen at the left Booster synchrotron The booster is an electron synchrotron which takes the 100 MeV beam from the linac and increases its energy to 3 GeV. The booster ring is 130 metres in circumference and contains a single 5-cell RF cavity (operating at 500 MHz) which provides energy to the electron beam. Acceleration of the beam is achieved by a simultaneous ramping up of the magnet strength and cavity fields. Each ramping cycle takes approximately 1 second (for a complete ramp up and down). Storage ring The storage ring is the final destination for the accelerated electrons. It is 216 metres in circumference and consists of 14 nearly identical sectors. Each sector consists of a straight section and an arc, with the arcs containing two dipole 'bending' magnets each. Each dipole magnet is a potential source of synchrotron light and most straight sections can also host an insertion device, giving the possibility of 30+ beamlines at the Australian Synchrotron. Two of the straight sections are used to host the storage ring 500 MHz RF cavities, which are essential for replacing the energy that the beam loses through synchrotron radiation. The storage ring also contains a large number of quadrupole and sextupole magnets used for beam focusing and chromaticity corrections. The ring is designed to hold 200 mA of stored current with a beam lifetime of over 20 hours. Vacuum systems The electron beam is kept within a very high vacuum at all times during the acceleration process and within the storage ring. This vacuum is necessary as any beam collisions with gas molecules will quickly degrade the beam quality and reduce the lifetime of the beam. The vacuum is achieved by enclosing the beam in a stainless steel pipe system, with numerous vacuum pump systems continually working to keep the vacuum quality high. Pressure within the storage ring is typically around 10‚àí13 bar (10 nPa). Control system Each digital and analogue I/O channel is associated with a database entry in a customised distributed open source database system called EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System). The condition of the system is monitored and controlled by connecting specialised GUIs to the specified database entries. There are about 171,000 database entries (also known as process variables), many of which relate to the physical I/O. About 105,000 of these are permanently archived at intervals ranging from tenths of a seconds to minutes. Some high level control of the physics-related parameters of the beam is provided through MATLAB which also provides data analysis tools and an interface with a computerised model of the accelerator. Personnel and equipment protection is achieved through the use of PLC-based systems, which also transfer data to EPICS. The Beamlines also use EPICS as the basis for their control.

It took place on 27 May 1940, during the Battle of France, at a time when troops of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) were attempting to retreat through the Pas-de-Calais region during the Battle of Dunkirk. Soldiers of the 2nd Battalion, the Royal Norfolk Regiment, had become isolated from their unit. They occupied and defended a farmhouse against an attack by Waffen-SS forces in the village of Le Paradis. After running out of ammunition, the defenders surrendered to the German troops. The Germans led them across the road to a wall where they were murdered by machine gun fire. Ninety-seven British troops were killed. Two survived, with injuries, and hid until they were captured by German forces several days later. After the war, Kn√∂chlein was convicted by a war crimes court, with the two survivors acting as witnesses against him. For his part in the massacre, Kn√∂chlein received the death penalty and was executed in 1949. Background The German invasion of France through the Low Countries began on 10 May 1940. Army Group A fought its way through southern Belgium and north-eastern France. German forces pushed the French Army and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to the Meuse river on 12 May, crossing it that evening.Jackson, The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940, pp. 221‚Äì556. From there, the German forces rapidly advanced to the English Channel over the course of the next week. BEF units, including detached companies of the Royal Norfolks and Royal Scots, were ordered to try to slow the German advance in northern France to buy time to evacuate troops at Dunkirk.Jackson, The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940, pp. 94‚Äì97.Wilson, Dunkirk: From Disaster to Deliverance, pp. 42‚Äì56. One of the participating German units, the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf, had been strongly indoctrinated with the Nazi Party ideology by its commander Theodor Eicke. Eicke's men had a fanatical loyalty to him and to Germany. The men of Totenkopf fought fiercely throughout the campaign, suffering higher death rates than other German forces. The Battle of France was SS Division Totenkopfs first major engagement of the Second World War. The division, part of the reserves of Army Group A, was called to the front line on 17 May. The unit was engaged in \\"mopping up\\" operations against Allied forces to the north and east of Cambrai.Sydnor, Soldiers of Destruction, p. 93. In total 16,000 prisoners had been taken by the division, but they had refused the surrender of 200 , who were murdered on the spot on 19 May.Mann, SS-Totenkopf, p. 76. By the time the operation had finished in Cambrai, the first German units had reached the English Channel, but the British counter-attacked just west of Arras on 21 May, following on from the counter-attack of the day before (Battle of Arras). The Totenkopf division suffered casualties of just under 100 men in repelling the assault. The Totenkopf was then ordered to the town of B√©thune and crossed the La Bass√©e river under British attack on 24 May. However, the division was ordered to retreat the next day to preserve tanks for the upcoming campaign in Dunkirk and to allow the Luftwaffe to attack Allied positions in the area.Mann, SS-Totenkopf, p. 85. It thus had to make the hazardous crossing again on the night of 26 May, and took B√©thune after heavy house-to-house fighting with the British, who withdrew to a line between Locon and Le Paradis.Mann, SS-Totenkopf, pp. 74‚Äì82. The 2nd Battalion of the Royal Norfolks, along with the 8th Lancashire Fusiliers, were holding the Allied line at the villages of Riez du Vinage, Le Cornet Malo and Le Paradis, with the battalion headquarters based at Le Paradis. The battalions had been ordered to hold out for as long as possible against the Germans to give time for the BEF to evacuate from Dunkirk. The SS Division Totenkopf emerged from the Bois de Paqueaut wood and attacked Le Cornet Malo at dawn on 27 May. The British troops defended stubbornly but were eventually overrun. The attack resulted in the deaths of four German officers and 150 men. Another 480 men and 18 officers were wounded. Later the same day, the German troops moved forward to attack Le Paradis.Mann, SS-Totenkopf, pp. 80‚Äì83.Jackson, The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940, pp. 285‚Äì288. Battle of Le Paradis The farmhouse where the survivors of the Royal Norfolks surrendered After the engagement at Le Cornet Malo, C Company and HQ Company of the 2nd Royal Norfolks had fallen back to their headquarters at Cornet Farm, just outside Le Paradis. The company commanders had been informed by radio that their units were isolated and would receive no assistance. They therefore dug in around the farmhouse, which lay on the Rue du Paradis, the boundary between the Royal Norfolk Regiment and the adjacent 1st Royal Scots. The Norfolks' last contact with Brigade Headquarters at L'Epinette was at 11:30, but despite a lack of support and heavy opposition, the defenders held out against the 14th Company, 1st Battalion of the 2nd SS Infantry Regiment until 17:15, when they ran out of ammunition.Jackson, The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940, pp. 288‚Äì289. During the battle the Germans attacked the farmhouse with mortars, tanks and artillery shelling, which destroyed the building and forced the defenders to relocate to a cowshed. SS-Standartenf√ºhrer Hans Friedemann G√∂tze, commander of the Totenkopf Division's third regiment, was killed in the fighting. The 99 surviving defenders of the 2nd Norfolks were eventually ordered by their commander Major Lisle Ryder, the brother of Robert Edward Dudley Ryder, to surrender. They left the cowshed that they had been defending under a white flag. As the boundary between the two British regiments was the road, Ryder's men surrendered not to the company they had been fighting, but rather to SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Fritz Kn√∂chlein's unit, which had been fighting the Royal Scots. Graves found near Le Paradis in 2007 suggest that around 20 men of the Royal Scots who surrendered to an SS unit may also have been killed in a separate massacre. Massacre The British captives, a majority of whom were wounded, were disarmed and marched down a road off the Rue du Paradis. While they were waiting, two machine-guns from No.4 Machine-gun Company were prepared and set up by a barn in a paddock of the farm. The British prisoners were marched to the barn, lined up alongside it and fired upon by the two German machinegunners, who continued firing until all the British had fallen. Kn√∂chlein then armed his men with bayonets to kill any remaining survivors. Satisfied that they had killed them all, the German soldiers left to rejoin the rest of their regiment.Jolly, The Vengeance of Private Pooley, pp. 104‚Äì119.H√ºrter, Hitlers Heerf√ºhrer: Die deutschen Oberbefehlshaber, p. 189. An account by Private Albert Pooley, one of only two survivors: > ... we turned off the dusty French road, through a gateway and into a meadow > beside the buildings of a farm. I saw with one of the nastiest feelings I > have ever had in my life two heavy machine guns inside the meadow ... > pointing at the head of our column. The guns began to spit fire ... for a > few seconds the cries and shrieks of our stricken men drowned the crackling > of the guns. Men fell like grass before a scythe ... I felt a searing pain > and pitched forward ... my scream of pain mingled with the cries of my > mates, but even before I fell into the heap of dying men, the thought > stabbed my brain 'If I ever get out of here, the swine that did this will > pay for it.'Mann, SS-Totenkopf, pp. 84‚Äì85. Ninety-seven British prisoners were killed and the Germans forced French civilians to bury the bodies in a shallow mass grave the next day. Despite the German efforts, Private William O'Callaghan had survived and pulled Private Albert Pooley alive from among the bodies in the field. The pair then hid in a pig-sty for three days and nights, surviving on raw potatoes and water from puddles before being discovered by the farm's owner, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and her son Victor. The French civilians risked their lives caring for the two men, who were later captured by the Wehrmacht's 251st Infantry Division and transferred to a military hospital.Jackson, The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940, pp. 331‚Äì379. Aftermath On the day after the massacre, 28 May, Gunter d'Alquen, a journalist in the Waffen-SS, arrived at the scene with Thum, the SS-Totenkopf deputy legal advisor. D'Alquen made a report of what he saw: > It was possible to look into the back yard from the road ... the corpses in > British uniform were lying in the yard near the buildings. They were lying > in such a position that one can assume they were killed by machine-gun > bursts. It struck me at once that the dead soldiers were not wearing > helmets, nor did they have any equipment on them ... I took pictures of the > dead bodies, and the whole farm. At Thum's request these were to be placed > at the disposal of the division ... I believe I was already sitting there in > the vehicle when Thum ... told me that in the field, from which he had just > returned, the equipment taken from the shot British soldiers was lying in a > heap, from which he had come to the conclusion that a summary trial had > taken place.Jackson, The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940, pp. > 301‚Äì302. Major Friedkerr von Riedner, who was also at the scene of the massacre on that day, reported that \\"These people had almost all suffered head wounds from shots that must have been fired at close range. Some had their whole skull smashed in, an injury that can almost only be caused by a blow from a gun butt or similar means.\\"Wilson, Dunkirk: From Disaster to Deliverance, p. 73. News of the massacre spread to neighbouring German divisions, eventually reaching General Erich Hoepner, commander of the German forces in France. He disliked the SS, especially Eicke, and was determined to have him dismissed if charges of mistreatment or murdering of prisoners could be brought. However, none of these investigations were ever successful. Regardless, many SS officers were appalled by the massacre; some reportedly challenged Kn√∂chlein to a duel, although none was ever fought. The Allies received no information about the massacre until the summer of 1943, when Pooley, who had spent the last three years in a German hospital due to the injuries he had suffered in the massacre, was declared medically unfit and repatriated. British authorities did not believe Pooley's story on his arrival; it was not thought that the German army were capable of such atrocities against British troops. Private O'Callaghan did not return to the United Kingdom until 1945 after the liberation of his prisoner-of-war camp. His confirmation of Pooley's story prompted an official investigation. The bodies of those killed in the massacre were exhumed in 1942 by the French, but only about 50 of the 97 were successfully identified. The bodies were then reburied in Le Paradis churchyard, which now forms part of the Le Paradis War Cemetery administered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. In 1970, a memorial plaque was placed on the barn wall where the massacre took place and a large memorial was subsequently erected beside the church. Trial of Kn√∂chlein Front view of the Curiohaus in Rotherbaum, Hamburg After the war, O'Callaghan's evidence and the discovery of the SS-run extermination camps prompted the British authorities to look into the reports. The massacre was investigated by the War Crimes Investigation Unit and after Kn√∂chlein's company was identified as the perpetrators in 1947, he was traced and arrested in Germany. Kn√∂chlein was arraigned on charges of war crimes in August 1948, to which he pleaded not guilty: > The accused Fritz Kn√∂chlein, a German national, in the charge of the Hamburg > Garrison Unit, pursuant to Regulation 4 of the Regulations for the Trial of > War Criminals, is charged with committing a war crime in that he in the > vicinity of Paradis, Pas-de-Calais, France, on or about 27 May 1940, in > violation of the laws and usages of war, was concerned in the killing of > about ninety prisoners-of-war, members of The Royal Norfolk Regiment and > other British Units. He was tried before Curiohaus war crimes court in Rotherbaum, in Court Number 5 on Monday, 11 October 1948. Kn√∂chlein's defence hinged on the claim that he was not present at the massacre, although his lawyers did not deny that the event took place. They also claimed that the British had used dumdum bullets during the battle and misused a flag of truce; all of which were vigorously denied by the prosecution. Evidence was given by Pooley, O'Callaghan, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and a French civilian who testified to recognising Kn√∂chlein.Jolly, The Vengeance of Private Pooley, pp. 167‚Äì198. On the twelfth day of the trial, during his summation, the Judge-Advocate said that whether the British had used illegal ammunition or abused a flag of truce was irrelevant; the German troops still had absolutely no right to execute prisoners of war without a fair and proper trial. On 25 October at 11:30, the president of the court pronounced the verdict that the defendant, Fritz Kn√∂chlein, had been found guilty of war crimes. His lawyer, Dr Uhde, made the following plea to the court for clemency on account of Kn√∂chlein's wife and family, who had attended every day of the trial: > All that is left for me to say is that some little doubt may have remained > in the minds of the Court which will enable the members not to award the > extreme penalty. Spare the life of the accused. He has a wife and four > children who are dependent upon him for support. Consider also the fact that > he is a soldier, and the Court is composed of members of the British Army. I > believe I am entitled to appeal to the Court to pronounce a sentence which > will enable my client to come out of prison at an early date. Despite this plea, at 15:00 he was sentenced to death by hanging, which was carried out on 28 January 1949 in Hamelin. No other German soldiers or officers were prosecuted for their roles in the massacre.

Designed for personal and commercial use, it is commonly found in utility roles such as bush flying‚Äîthanks to its short takeoff and landing (STOL) ability‚Äîas well as agriculture, pipeline patrol, and glider and banner towing.  Development  The Scout was designed and initially produced by Bellanca Aircraft Corporation, and is a derivative of the 7-series Citabrias and 8KCAB Decathlon; Bellanca had been building these designs since receiving them in the acquisition of Champion Aircraft Corporation in 1970. The Scout is one of two wholly Bellanca-developed contributions to these aircraft series, and is also one of only two airplanes Bellanca produced in the 7 and 8 series not certified for aerobatics. (The other model, in both categories, is the 7ACA.) The Scout carries the model designation 8GCBC, which makes it both a sibling of the 8KCAB Decathlon and descendant of the 7GCBC Citabria. Bellanca produced more than 350 Scouts before production ended when the company's assets were liquidated in 1981. The Scout design passed through the hands of a number of companies through the 1980s, including a Champion Aircraft Company, which was unrelated to the Champion Aircraft of the 1960s. In that period, only one Scout was built, in 1984. American Champion Aircraft Corporation acquired the Scout design, along with the Decathlon and the group of Citabria and Champ variants, in 1990 and brought the Scout back into production in 1993. ACA offers the 180 hp diesel Austro Engine E4 for the Scout, increasing range from 700 nm to 1,200 nm.Thurber, Matt. \\"AirVenture Report: 2014\\" AINonline, 1 September 2014. Accessed: 4 September 2014.  Design  The Scout traces its lineage back to the Aeronca Champ, by way of the Citabria. Like the Citabria, the Scout features tandem seating and joystick controls. The fuselage and tail surfaces are constructed of welded metal tubing. The outer shape of the fuselage is created by a combination of wooden formers and longerons, covered with fabric. The cross-section of the metal fuselage truss is triangular, a design feature traceable to the earliest Aeronca C-2 design of the late 1920s. The strut- braced wings of the Scout are, like the fuselage and tail surfaces, fabric covered, utilizing aluminum ribs. The wings of Bellanca Scouts were built with wooden spars. American Champion has been using aluminum spars in the aircraft it has produced and has, as well, made the aluminum-spar wings available for retrofit installation on older aircraft. Compared to the Citabria's wingspan of , the Scout's wingspan is significantly wider, at over . The Scout also carries wing flaps, a design feature it shares with the 7GCBC variant of the Citabria. The added wing area and the flaps contribute to the Scout's STOL abilities and its capacity as a utility aircraft. The landing gear of the Scout is in a conventional arrangement. The main gear legs of most Scouts are made of spring steel, though American Champion began to use aluminum gear legs in 2004. Compared to the Citabria's gear, the Scout's gear legs are considerably taller and the tires larger, again contributing to its capabilities as a utility aircraft. Bellanca made the Scout available with several Lycoming O-360 engine variants, all of 180 horsepower (134 kW), with the choice of a fixed-pitch or constant speed propeller. American Champion's Scouts feature the Lycoming O-360-C1G and a choice of a two-blade constant speed propeller (standard) or a three-blade constant speed propeller as an option.  Operational history  The success in utility roles of the Citabrias, both the 7GCAA and particularly the 7GCBC‚Äîthe Scout's closest relative in the Citabria line‚Äîwas the impetus for Bellanca's creation of the Scout, with its greater wing area, larger engine, better ground clearance, and higher gross weight and useful load. Though the Scout went out of production within less than a decade of its introduction, this was not due to any fault in the design but rather to the slump in general aviation in the United States at the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s. Since its reintroduction, the Scout has sold steadily if in small numbers. Scouts remain popular as bush planes‚Äîincluding versions fitted with floats or skis, for glider and banner towing, for pipeline patrol, in agricultural uses, and as personal aircraft. The largest single operator of the type the Royal Canadian Air Cadet League, operating over 20 of them in Ontario and the Prairie provinces as tow aircraft for glider training. Another large operator is Western Australia's Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA), who operate a fleet of ten aircraft in the fire surveillance and Forward Air Control (FAC) roles. DBCA replace each aircraft with a new example as they reach 4000 airframe hours, thus they are also American Champion's largest Scout customer.  Wood spar Airworthiness Directive  A number of Scouts were involved in accidents--many fatal--that involved wing spar failures. More than a few of these accidents involved aerobatics, maneuvers that the aircraft was neither designed nor approved for. The Scout suffered, in this respect, from a close resemblance to the Citabria line of aircraft, all of which are capable of aerobatics. To some pilots, the similar appearance suggested similar ability. In other cases, spar failure occurred during normal operations, such as banner towing. The failures occurred during high-stress portions of the flights, but under stresses that the design should have withstood. Typically, investigations found that these failures during normal operation had been preceded by undetected overstressing conditions from flight outside the aircraft's limitations (such as aerobatics) or accidents where the wings contacted the ground (including ground loops and nose-overs in which the airplane ended up on its back). This series of failures led the Federal Aviation Administration to issue an Airworthiness Directive (AD 2000-25-02 R1) that affected all wood-spar wing Scouts. The AD called for immediate and thorough inspections of the wing spars of any Scouts involved in accidents. Further, the AD mandates meticulous yearly inspections for all Scouts with wood-spar wings. Scouts built by American Champion, as well as those retrofitted with the factory metal-spar wings, are exempt from the AD's inspection requirements.

Textile design is further broken down into three major disciplines, printed textile design, woven textile design, and mixed media textile design, each of which utilize different methods to produce a surface ornamented fabric for variable uses and markets. Textile Design as a practice has evolved to become an industry integral to other disciplines such as fashion, interior design, and fine arts.Point paper for Dove and Rose woven double cloth by William Morris, 1879.  Overview  Textile designing is a creative field that includes fashion design, carpet manufacturing and any other cloth-related field. Clothing, carpets, drapes, towels, and rugs are all functional products resulting from textile design. Within the fashion industry, textile designers have the ability to inspire collections, trends, and styles. Textile designers marry a creative vision of what a finished textile will look like with a deep understanding of the technical aspects of production and the properties of fiber, yarn, and dyes.Gale, Lahori, and Kaur, The Textile Book, p. 37  Textile Design Disciplines   Printed Textile Design  Printed textile design: William Morris, Strawberry Thief, 1883. Printed textile designs are produced by the application of various printing processes to fabric or cloth and other media, namely: resist printing, relief printing, rotogravure, screen printing, transfer printing, and digital printing. These processes utilize various inks and dyes to imprint aesthetic, often repeating patterns, motifs, and styles onto the fabric or cloth. Printed textile designers are predominantly and inextricably involved with home interior design (designing patterns for carpets, wallpapers, or even ceramics), the fashion and clothing industries, and the paper industry (designing stationary or gift wrap). There are numerous established and enduring printed styles and designs that can be broken down into four major categories: floral, geometric, world cultures, and conversational. Floral designs include flowers, plants, or any botanical theme. Geometric designs feature themes both inorganic and abstract such as tessellations. Designs surrounding world cultures may be traced to a specific geographic, ethnic, or anthropological source. Finally, conversational designs are designs that fit less easily into the other categories: they may be described as presenting \\"imagery that references popular icons of a particular time period or season, or which is unique and challenges our perceptions in some way.\\" Each category contains sundry, more specific individual styles and designs. Different clothes, moreover, require different dyes: for example, silk, wool, or other protein-based fabrics require acidic dyes based whereas synthetic fabrics require specialized disperse dyes. The advent of computer- aided design software, such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator, has allowed each discipline of textile design to evolve and innovate new practices and processes, but has most influenced the production of printed textile designs. Most prominently, digital tools have made the process of creating repeating patterns or motifs, or repeats, much more effective and simple. Repeats are used to create patterns both visible and invisible to the eye: geometric patterns are intended to depict clear, intentional patterns, whereas floral or organic designs, for instance, are intended to create unbroken repeats that are ideally undetectable. Poorly constructed repeats draw the eye to portions of the textile that expose the pattern and break the illusion of continuity, an issue called \\"tracking,\\" which is easily remedied in a digital environment. These tools, alongside the innovation of digital inkjet printing, have allowed the textile printing process to become faster, more scalable, and sustainable.  Woven Textile Design  Woven textile design emanates from the practice of weaving which produces fabric by interlacing a vertical yarn (warp) and a horizontal yarn (weft), most often at right angles. Woven textile designs are created by various types of looms and are now predominantly produced using a mechanized or computerized jacquard loom.Woven textile design: A woven Navajo saddle blanket from the Philbrook Museum in Tulsa, Oklahoma.Designs within the context of weaving are created using various types of yarns, utilizing variance in texture, size, and color to construct a stylized patterned or monochromatic fabric. There are a large range of yarn types available to the designer, including but not limited to cotton, twill, linen, and synthetic fibers. In order to produce the woven fabric, the designer first delineates and visualizes the sequence of threading which is traditionally drawn out on graph paper known as a point paper.Rothstein, Woven Textile Design in Britain to 1750 The designer also will choose a weave structure which governs the aesthetic design that will be produced. The most common process is a plain weave, in which the yarns interlace in an alternating, tight formation producing a strong and flexible multi-use fabric. Twill weaves, which are also common, alternatively utilize diagonal lines created by floating the warp or the weft to the left or the right. This process creates a softer fabric favored by designers in the fashion and clothing design industries. Common and recognizable twill styles include patterns like houndstooth or herringbone. Beyond weave structure, color is another dominant aspect governing woven textile design. Typically, designers choose two or more contrasting colors that will be woven into patterns based on the designer's chosen threading sequence. Color is also dependent on the size of the yarn: fine yarns will produce a fabric that may change colors when it receives light from different angles whereas larger yarns will generally produce a more monochromatic surface.  Mixed Media Textile Design  Kazakh, chain stitched rug. Mixed media textiles designs are produced utilizing embroidery or other various fabric manipulation processes such as pleating, appliqu√©, quilting, and laser cutting. Embroidery is traditionally performed by hand, applying myriad stitches of thread to construct designs and patterns on the textile surface. Similar to printed textile design, embroidery affords the designer a vast amount of artistic and aesthetic control. Typical stitches include but are not limited to the cross stitch, the chain stitch, and couching. Although industrial and mechanized embroidery has become the standard, hand stitching still remains a fixture for fine arts textiles. Quilting, traditionally used to enhance the insulation and warmth of a textile, also provides the designer the opportunity to apply aesthetic properties. Most commonly quilts feature geometric and collage designs formed from a various textiles of different textures and colors. Quilting also frequently employs the use of recycled scrap or heirloom fabrics. Quilts are also often used as medium for an artist to depict a personal or communal narrative: for example, the Hmong people have a tradition of creating story quilts or cloths illustrating their experiences with immigration to the United States from Eastern and Southeastern Asia.  Textile Design and the Environment  The practice and industry of textile design present environmental concerns. From the production of cloth from raw material, to dyeing and finishing, and finally the ultimate disposal of products, each step of the process produces environmental implications that have proliferated with the emergence of fast fashion and other modern industrial practices. Predominantly, these environmental impacts stem from the heavy use of hazardous chemicals involved in each step of the textile creation process which must be properly disposed of. Other considerations involve the amount of waste created by the disposal of textile design products and the reclamation and re-use of recyclable textiles. The Environmental Protection Agency reported that over 15 millions tons of textile waste is created annually. This consists of some 5% of all municipal waste generated and only 15% of that waste is recovered and reused. These concerns have led to the birth of sustainable textile design movements and the practice of ecological design within the field. For instance, London's Royal Society of the Arts hosts design competitions that compel all entrants to center their design and manufacturing methods around sustainable practices and materials.

It is used by authors, individuals, libraries, and publishers. Based in Portland, Maine, LibraryThing was developed by Tim Spalding and went live on August 29, 2005. As of June 2020, it has 2,375,000 users and over 135 million books catalogued. Features The primary feature of LibraryThing (\\"LT\\") is the cataloging of books, movies, music and other media by importing data from libraries through Z39.50 connections and from six Amazon.com stores. Library sources supply Dublin Core and MARC records to LT; users can import information from over 2000 libraries, including the British Library, Canadian National Catalogue, Library of Congress, National Library of Australia, and Yale University. Should a record not be available from any of these sources, it is also possible to input the book information manually via a blank form. Each work may comprise different editions, translations, printings, audio versions, etc. Members are encouraged to add publicly visible reviews, descriptions, Common Knowledge and other information about a work; ratings, collections and tags help categorization. Discussion in the forums is also encouraged. Items are classified using the Melvil Decimal System, based on the out-of-copyright 1922 edition of the Dewey Decimal Classification with modifications for standard spelling of division names (as opposed to the original names, which were spelled in accordance with Dewey's advocated spelling reforms), and modernised terminology.  Social features  LibraryThing's social features have been compared to bookmark manager Del.icio.us and the collaborative music service Last.fm. Similar book cataloging sites include aNobii, BookLikes, Goodreads, Libib, Shelfari [now merged with Goodreads], and weRead. TinyCat In 2016 LibraryThing launched TinyCat, an OPAC designed for the cataloging and circulation of libraries of up to 20,000 items. TinyCat is marketed towards small independent libraries, such as schools, community centers, religious institutions, academic departments, as well as individuals. Ownership LibraryThing is majority owned by founder Tim Spalding. Online bookseller AbeBooks (now owned by Amazon) bought a 40% share in LibraryThing in May 2006 for an undisclosed sum. In January 2009, Cambridge Information Group acquired a minority stake in the company, and their subsidiary Bowker became the official distributor to libraries. Publicity At the end of June 2006, LibraryThing was subject to the Slashdot effect from a Wall Street Journal article. The site's developers added servers to compensate for the increased traffic. In December of the same year, the site received yet more attention from Slashdot over its UnSuggester feature, which draws suggestions from books least likely to appear in the same catalog as a given book.

In the late 1990s, Joyce returned to the Playboy fold full-time as one of Hefner's assistants in the Playboy Mansion. Film actress Nizzari appears in two films starring Frank Sinatra: A Hole In The Head (1959) and Come Blow Your Horn (1963). In the latter, a Paramount Pictures release, she played a zany interpretive dancer named Snow. When she signed to play in Come Blow Your Horn, Nizzari had completed Chips Off the Old Block, a Barry Ashton dance revue, at the Statler Hilton in Los Angeles. She also played a bit part in the slapstick comedy The Great Race with Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis. Marriage Nizzari was married to character actor Jack Hogan.

Though their exact origins are unclear, western India is a notable point of origin. Their language stems from and is similar to modern-day Gujarati and Rajasthani, borrowing loan words from other languages as they migrated from India. In Europe, even though their culture has been victimized by other cultures, they have still found a way to maintain their heritage and society.  Origins  The arrival of the Romas to different countries in Europe Linguistic and phonological research has traced the Roma people's origin to places in the Indian subcontinent, specifically linking Proto-Romani groups to Central India. Many report in extracts from popular literature that Romani emerged from the North-west regions of India, rather than from Central India.https://books.openedition.org/ceup/1549?lang=en Features of phonological developments which emerged during the early transition stage from Old to Middle Indic prove that the history of Romani began in Central India. The Romani language shares many features with the Central Indo-Aryan languages such as Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi and Rajasthani; it also shares connections with Northern Indo-Aryan languages like Kashmiri, and the language itself contains a cluster of Persian and Arabic words. Linguists use these phonological similarities as well as features of phonological developments which emerged during the early transition stage from Old to Middle Indic to conclude that the history of Romani began in Central India. Other factors such as blood groups and unwritten customs also suggest Central Indian origins of the Roma. The Roma find issues with documenting their own exact origin due to a lack of finding specific records left by ancestors. Their history however is retold by clan family customs, such as singing and storytelling. Records cannot identify exactly why the Roma migrated from India; there are a number of possible motives, such as famine and military invasions on the part of Alexander the Great (356-323 BCE) and/or Mahmud of Ghazni (971-1030 CE).  Names  The Romani people are today found in many countries. Typically, Romani adopt given names that are common in the country of their residence. Seldom do modern Romani use traditional names from their own language, such as Papush, Luludi, Patrin, etc. It is the only Indo-Aryan language that has been spoken exclusively around Europe since the Middle Ages. Speakers use many terms for their language. They generally refer to their language as ≈ôomani ƒçhib translated as ‚Äòthe Romani language‚Äô, or ≈ôomanes, ‚Äòin a Rom way‚Äô. The English term, Romani, has been used by scholars since the 19th Century, where previously they had used the term 'Gypsy Language'.  Family and life stages  A bridesmaid at a Romani wedding in Brno, Czech Republic (2006 photograph) Traditionally, Roma place a high value on the extended family. Marriage and controversies Marriage in Romani society underscores the importance of family and demonstrates ties between different groups, often transnationally. Traditionally an arranged marriage is highly desirable. Parents of the potential bridal couple help identify an ideal partner for their child. Parents rarely force a particular spouse on their child, although it is an established norm to be married by your mid-twenties. School, church, weddings, and other events are also popular environments for finding a prospective spouse; Potential couples are expected to be supervised or chaperoned by an adult. With the emergence of both social media such as Facebook and mobile phones, and the advancing education of women, many traditional mores and conservative views have become less rigid. In some Romani groups, for example the Finnish Roma, the idea of a legally registered marriage is ignored altogether. Traditionally, the Romani community is highly patriarchal, such that issues like virginity is considered essential in unmarried women. This practice provides a visible representation of a young women's preserved purity and thereby the maintained honour of her family. As a result, men and women often marry very young. The Romani practice of child marriage has generated substantial controversy across the world. In 2003, one of the many self-styled Romani \\"kings\\", Ilie TorticƒÉ, prohibited marriage before the parties were of legal age in their country of residence. A Romani patriarch, Florin CioabƒÉ, ran afoul of Romanian authorities in late 2003 when he married off his youngest daughter, Ana-Maria, at the age of twelve, well below the legal marriageable age. Bride kidnapping is believed to be a traditional part of Romani practice. Girls as young as twelve years old may be kidnapped for marriage to teenage boys. This practice has been reported in Ireland, England, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Bulgaria and Slovakia. Bride kidnapping is thought to be a way to avoid a bride price or a means for a girl to marry a boy she wants but that her parents do not want. The tradition's normalisation of kidnapping puts young women at higher risk of becoming victims of human trafficking. The practices of bride kidnapping and child marriage are not universally accepted throughout Romani culture. Some Romani women and men seek to eliminate such customs. Romani mothers breastfeed their children for optimal health and increased immunity. They also view this as a gift from God, and a help to building healthy relationships between mothers and children. Romani law considers oral sex, sodomy and homosexuality crimes against nature and Scripture. Roma men are allowed to have more sex and express their libido more openly than women. Pregnancy means a woman is impure in the Romani culture.https://www.oocities.org/~patrin/birth.htm Having sexual intercourse before marriage is considered dirty. A Romani man marrying a gadji (non-Romani woman) is more acceptable than a Romani female marrying a gadjo. Many tribes consider the children Romani only if the father is Romani in mixed marriages.https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/weddings/Romani+Marriage+Traditions-125.html Purity and death Parts of the human body are considered impure: the genital organs, because they produce impure emissions, and the lower body. Clothes for the lower body, as well as the clothes of menstruating women, are washed separately. Items used for eating are washed in a different place. Childbirth is considered \\"impure\\" and must occur outside the dwelling place; the mother is considered \\"impure\\" for 40 days. Death is seen as \\"impure\\" and affects the whole family of the dead, who may remain \\"impure\\" for a period after the death; usually private items of the dead are considered to be impure and are to be buried in his/her grave or given to non-Romani poor people. \\"Impure\\" is not literal but rather linked to cleanliness. This practice of burial (rather than cremation) is also found amongst the nomadic people of Western India to this day. Notable deviations from this practice exist among German Roma and British Romanichal, the latter holding a tradition of cremation similar to that of some Hindu cultures. Up until the mid-20th century they invariably burned the deceased person and all their earthly belongings, including the dwelling place, all which was considered spiritually impure. During the latter half of the 20th century British Romanichal began adopting the burial customs of their Continental cousins. It is believed the soul of the deceased does not officially enter Heaven until after the burial. The Romani hygiene is to shampoo daily since keeping the head clean is symbolic. Romani people use a separate washcloth, towel and soap for the upper and lower body. Pets are rare among Romani people. In Romani culture, Cats and dogs are considered unclean. Horses are considered a sacred animal to the Roma. Romani people use herbs to heal such as burdock root extract and basil tea. Romani people brought jimson weed from India to Europe. Romani people use elderberry to treat the flu. Oils such as cinnamon, cloves, rosemary, lemon and lemongrass were used by Romani people to treat the Bubonic plague in Europe. Horseradish juice mixed with honey is another Romani remedy. Romani people believe in ghosts and the afterlife. Gold jewelry is valued by the Romani. After Romani mothers give birth, anything they've touched must be thrown out after the baby has been baptized.  Child upbringing  Romani people incorporate their values into how they raise their children. There is an element of impurity placed upon both the mother and father after the mother gives birth. This impurity is lessened if the child is a male and the family is considered ‚Äúlucky‚Äù. Traditionally, the couple will live with the father of the groom until their first child is born. Romani people place high value on extended family so godparents, along with this other family, are active in the child‚Äôs life to ensure its well-being. The child‚Äôs parents often do not have an input in what their child eats throughout the day, so the child relies on eating whatever happens to come their way.  Moral values  Romanipen Romanipen (also romanypen, romanipe, romanype, romanimos, romaimos, romaniya) is a complicated concept of Romani philosophy encompassing totality of the Romani spirit, culture, law, being a Rom, a set of Romani strains. An ethnic Rom is considered to be a Gadjo (non-Romani) in Romani society if he has no Romanipen. Sometimes a Gadjo, usually an adopted child, may be considered to be a Rom if he has Romanipen. As a concept, Romanipen has been the subject of interest to numerous academic observers. It has been hypothesized that it owes more to a framework of culture than simply an adherence to historically received rules. Significant changes in Romani culture following the Second World War have been attributed to the suspension of these social norms, as strict rules relating to food and contact with certain classes of people broke down. This period also coincided with a perceived loss of authority invested in traditional leaders, the primary maintainers of Romanipen. Furthermore, the Roma who found themselves under Soviet control during the war, while deported to the east of the Urals and often persecuted, were generally left alone to follow their orthodox practices and thus preserved strict interpretations of Romanipen. However, the Roma who lived in other countries of eastern Europe, in the face of widespread discrimination and society's attempts at forced assimilation, often had to compromise their strict interpretation of the customs just in order to survive. As a result, the whole concept of Romanipen became interpreted differently among various Roma groups.  Being a part of Romani society  A considerable punishment for a Rom is banishment from Romani society. An expelled person is considered to be \\"contaminated\\" and is shunned by other Romanis. Travelling Roma left symbols or signposts for their traveling fellows, known as patrins (an old word for leaf).  Romani Code  Romani Code, or Romano Zakono, is the most important part of Romanipen. It is a set of rules for Romani life. Though Romani ethnic groups have different sets of rules, some rules are common for all. Those rules are considered to be the Romani Code, and rules that differ are called \\"customs\\". Oral Romani cultures are most likely to adhere to the Romani code, these communities are geographically spread. There are proverbs about the Romani Code and customs, such as: * There exist as many customs as there are Romani groups. (Kitsyk Roma, dakitsyk obychaye in Ruska Roma's dialect) * There are many Romani groups, but only one Law. (Romen isy but, a Zakono yekh in Ruska Roma's and Kaldarash dialects) Rules of Romani Code describe relationships inside the Romani community and set limits for customs, behavior and other aspects of life. The Romani Code is not written; the Romani people keep it alive in oral tradition. The kris is a traditional institution for upholding and enforcing the Romani Code. The code can be summarised in pillars; the main pillar representing the polar ideas of baxt (pronounced \\"baht\\") meaning honour and lad≈æ (pronounced \\"Ladge\\") meaning shame. Linking to the article above in reference to \\"purity\\" they can also represent the idea of being \\"pure\\" or \\"clean\\" and \\"impure\\" and \\"unclean\\" It is honourable, in Romani culture, to celebrate baxt by being generous and displaying your success to the public. The focus on generosity means sharing food is of great importance to some groups of Roma. Making lavish meals to share with other Romani visitors is commonplace and in some cases not having food to share is considered shameful. Faith and religion The cult of Saint Sara in the shrine of Saintes- Maries-de-la-Mer, Southern France is a devotion associated with Catholic Romanies. Hinduism While in India, the Romani people followed the Hindu religion. This theory is supported by the Romani word for \\"cross\\", trushul, which is the word which describes Shiva's trident (Trishul). A Hindu foundation means that the concept of kuntari, a universal balance, is central to the people's spirituality. Kuntari means that all things belong in the universe according to their natural place. However, animals such as the flightless hen and frogs, an animal with the ability to negotiate land and water, are considered to be out of balance and are, therefore, inherently unlucky. Consequently, Roma avoid hens' eggs and frogs. Roma believe in the idea of \\"pollution\\", whereby the human body is vulnerable to pollution following the breaking of certain taboos‚Äîpollution leads to a person becoming out of balance, like the frog and the hen. If such taboos are broken, restoration of one's purity can only be attained through a trial overseen by a tribunal of Romani elders. This tribunal determines whether a person is guilty or innocent and, in the case of the former, the subject of the trial must complete a period of isolation for the purpose of eventual reinstatement (in particularly severe cases of pollution, permanent estrangement has occurred, but this is apparently rare in the modern era). Such pollution taboos do not apply until a Rom has undergone puberty. Many branches of Christianity have been adopted by Roma. Deities and saints Blessed Ceferino Gim√©nez Malla is considered a patron saint of the Romani people in Roman Catholicism. Saint Sarah, or Kali Sara, has been revered as a patron saint in the same manner as the Blessed Ceferino Gim√©nez Malla, but a transition occurred in the 21st century, whereby Kali Sara is understood as an Indian deity brought by the refugee ancestors of the Romani people, thereby removing any Christian association. Saint Sarah is progressively being considered as \\"a Romani goddess, the Protectress of the Roma\\" and an \\"indisputable link with Mother India\\". Ceremonies and practices Roma often adopt the dominant religion of their host country if a ceremony associated with a formal religious institution is necessary, such as a baptism or funeral (their particular belief systems and indigenous religion and worship remain preserved regardless of such adoption processes). The Roma continue to practice \\"Shaktism\\", a practice with origins in India, whereby a female consort is required for the worship of a god. Adherence to this practice means that for the Romani who worship a Christian God, prayer is conducted through the Virgin Mary, or her mother, Saint Anne. Shaktism continues over 1,000 years after the people's separation from India. Romani elders serve as spiritual leaders; there are no specific Roma priests, churches, or Roma scriptures, the exception being the Pentecostal Roma, most in Western society. Balkans For the Romani communities that have resided in the Balkans for centuries, often referred to as \\"Turkish Gypsies\\", the following histories apply for religious beliefs: * Bulgaria: In northwestern Bulgaria and Sofia and Kyustendil, Islam has been the dominant religion; however, in the independent Bulgarian state, a major conversion to Eastern Orthodox Christianity has occurred. In southwestern Bulgaria (Pirin Macedonia), Islam is the dominant religion, with a smaller section of the population, declaring themselves as \\"Turks\\", continuing to mix ethnicity with Islam. * Romania: Most Romani people in Romania are Orthodox Christians. * Greece: The descendants of groups, such as Sepeƒçides or Sevljara, Kalpazaja, Filipid≈æi and others, living in Athens, Thessaloniki, central Greece and Aegean Macedonia are mostly Orthodox Christians, with Islamic beliefs held by a minority of the population. Following the Peace Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, many Muslims resettled Turkey, in the consequent population exchange between Turkey and Greece. * Albania: Albania's Romani people are all Muslims. * Macedonia: The majority of Romani people believe in Islam. * Serbia: Most Romani people in Serbia are Orthodox; in the disputed territory of Kosovo the vast majority of the Romani population is Muslim. * Bosnia, Montenegro and Herzegovina: Islam is the dominant religion. * Croatia: Following World War II, a large number of Muslim Roma relocated to Croatia (the majority moved from Kosovo). In the Balkans, the Roma of North Macedonia and southern Serbia, including the disputed territory of Kosovo, have been particularly active in Islamic mystical brotherhoods (Sufism)‚ÄîMuslim Roma immigrants to Western Europe and America have brought these traditions with them.https://journals.openedition.org/balkanologie/589 Other regions Ukraine and Russia contain Romani Muslim populations, as the families of Balkan migrants continue to live there. The descendants' ancestors settled on the Crimean peninsula during the 17th and 18th centuries, but most descendants migrated to Ukraine, southern Russia and the Povolzhie (along the Volga River). Formally, Islam is the religion that these communities align themselves with, and the people are recognized for their staunch preservation of the Romani language and identity. Most Eastern European Roma are Roman Catholic, Orthodox Christian, or Muslim.https://muse.jhu.edu/article/670188/pdf Those in Western Europe and the United States are mostly Roman Catholic or Protestant. In southern Spain, many Roma are Pentecostal, but this is a small minority that has emerged in contemporary times. In Egypt, the Roma are split into Christian and Muslim populations. For countless years, dance has been considered a religious procedure for the Egyptian Roma. In Turkey, the Romani people are Muslim and the males are circumcised, while the majority of Roma in Latin America have maintained their European religions, with most following Orthodox Christianity. In Hungary, some Romani people practice Buddhism. In Russia, Romani people worship Hindi deities Brahma, Indra, Lakshmi and other Hindu gods. Romani people are superstitious and believe a black cat and a horseshoe as a sign of good luck. Evangelicalism Since World War II, a growing number of Roma have embraced Evangelical movements. For the first time, Roma became ministers and created their own, autonomous churches and missionary organizations. In some countries, the majority of Roma belong to Romani churches. This unexpected change has greatly contributed to a better image of Roma in society. The work they perform is seen as more legitimate, and they have begun to obtain legal permits for commercial activities. Evangelical Romani churches exist in every country where Roma are settled. The movement is particularly strong in France and Spain; there are more than 1,000 Romani churches (known as \\"Filadelfia\\" or simply el culto) in Spain, with almost 100 in Madrid alone. In Germany, the most numerous group is that of Polish Roma, with their main church in Mannheim. Other important and numerous Romani assemblies are in Los Angeles, Houston, Buenos Aires, and Mexico.  Contemporary art and culture  Persian poet Firdusi from Iran was the first to reference Romani people and their migrations. In Roman mythology, Romani people are believed to be the offspring of deities Mercury and Vulcan. Flamenco art that portrays Romani dancers has spread from Spain to New Mexico in the United States.http://www.internationalfolkart.org/exhibition/2683/flamenco-from- spain-to-new-mexico  Dance  Romani people influenced flamenco with their dances from their homeland India and used the flamenco dance to then forget about their persecutions in Spain. Romani people also influenced Mexican dances in Mexico. In Spain, there are Romani flamenco concerts and shows.  Music  Romani musicians entertaining The lƒÉutari who perform at traditional Romanian weddings are virtually all Roma, although their music draws from a vast variety of ethnic traditions‚Äîfor example Romanian, Turkish, Jewish, and Slavic‚Äîas well as Romani traditions. Probably the most internationally prominent contemporary performer in the lƒÉutari tradition is Taraful Haiducilor. Zdob ≈üi Zdub, one of the most prominent rock bands in Moldova, although not Roma themselves, draw heavily on Romani music, as do Spitalul de Urgen≈£ƒÉ in Romania. Flamenco music and dance came from the Roma in Spain; the distinctive sound of Romani music has also strongly influenced bolero, jazz, and Cante Jondo in Europe. European-style Gypsy jazz is still widely practised among the original creators (the Romani People); one who acknowledged this artistic debt was Django Reinhardt. Romani music has become national music in Hungary, Russia and Spain. Due to the pervading influence of an encompassing social media culture across the globe, Hip hop music has gained popularity among Romani people. Romani hip hop in Europe draws similarity to African American hip hop in the United States. Romani people and African Americans have both experienced exclusion, oppression and neglect which is expressed through hip hop music.https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/roma-hip- hop-and-rap-emerges-world-stage Some scholars have expressed concern at the erosion of traditional cultures enabled by social media.https://www.huffpost.com/entry/traditional-culture-and-m_b_655992  Classical music  Romani music is very important in Eastern European cultures such as Hungary, Russia, and Romania. Performance practices by Romani musicians have influenced European classical composers such as Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms. Language The Romani language is spoken by millions of Romani people throughout the world. It is of the Indo-Aryan branch. Many Romani people are bilingual and can speak two or more languages. Observances Each June, Gypsy Roma Traveller History Month is celebrated in London.Event to mark Gypsy and traveller day. June 5, 2015. International Romani Day is a holiday celebrated in Europe especially in Budapest, Bulgaria, Romania and Eastern Europe on April 8. Romani people wave the Romani flag on International Romani Day every April 8. Cuisine Gypsy steak In Hungary, there is a Romani influence on Hungarian food. Many Hungarian dishes have a Romani variation such as cig√°nypecsenye, a dish served with fries, bacon and salad. and goulash. Rigo Jancsi, a Hungarian chocolate dessert is named after a Hungarian Roma. Romani people cook family recipes such as bodag (cig√°nykeny√©r) in Hungary. There is a Romani restaurant called Romani Kafenava in Maribor, Slovenia. In Budapest, there is Romani restaurant called Romani Platni. In Romania, Romani people eat mƒÉmƒÉligƒÉ. There's a Romani cookbook called the Gypsy cookbook. Romani people drink a lot of tea and there is a tea brand based on Romani people called Zhena‚Äôs Gypsy Tea. Gypsy style tea is black tea served with fruit such as strawberries, lemons and apples. Stuffed cabbage, soup, vegetables and stuffed peppers are a part of the Romani diet. Lettuce, garlic, vinegar and onion are considered lucky foods in the Romani culture. Coffee and cakes are usually served to guests. Roma believe that some foods are auspicious, or lucky (baxtalo), particularly those with pungent tastes like garlic, lemon, tomato, peppers, and fermented foods like sauerkraut, pickles and sour cream. One of the most sacred foods to Romani people is bread. Romani people usually avoid public restaurants. In Spanish cuisine, Romani people cook olla gitana which is made of chickpeas, pumpkins, almonds, and pears and brazo gitano, a Spanish dessert. Ian Hancock called Romani food the soul food of Europe. For breakfast, Romani people eat eggs, bacon, donuts and drink coffee. Chicken, lamb, goat, rabbit meat and wild game and birds are preferred meat by Romani people. Fried bread dishes are xaritsa (fried cornbread), pufe (fried wheat bread) and bogacha (baked bread). Romani desserts include pirogo which is similar to Jewish kugel.  Theatre, circus and cinema  There exist four well-known Romani theatres in the world, Romen Theatre, Romance Theatre, Romanothan and Phralipe, and also many small theatres. Fortune-telling A stereotype that Romani people have psychic powers (e.g. fortune-teller) is still sometimes present, and some romantics attribute the invention of the Tarot cards to them.  Relations with other people  An 1852 Wallachian poster advertising an auction of Romani slaves. Because of their nomadic lifestyle and differences in language and culture, Roma and their more settled neighbours have held each other in distrust. The popular image of Roma as tramps and thieves unfit for work contributed to their widespread persecution. This belief is often cited as the etymological source of the term gyp, meaning to \\"cheat\\", as in \\"I got gypped by a con man.\\" There are still tensions between Roma and the majority population around them. Common complaints are that Roma steal and live off social welfare and residents often reject Romani encampments. This has led to Roma being described as \\"perhaps the most hated minority in Europe.\\" In the UK, travellers (referring to both Irish Travellers and Roma) became a 2005 general election issue, with Michael Howard, the then-leader of the Conservative Party promising to review the Human Rights Act 1998. This law, which absorbs the European Convention on Human Rights into UK primary legislation, is seen by some to permit the granting of retrospective planning permission for Romani communities. Severe population pressures and the paucity of greenfield sites have led to travellers purchasing land and setting up residential settlements almost overnight, thus subverting the planning restrictions imposed on other members of the community. Travellers argued in response that thousands of retrospective planning permissions are granted in Britain in cases involving non-Romani applicants each year and that statistics showed that 90% of planning applications by Roma and travellers were initially refused by local councils, compared with a national average of 20% for other applicants, potentially disproving claims of preferential treatment favouring Roma. They also argued that the root of the problem was that many traditional stopping- places had been barricaded off and that legislation passed by the previous Conservative government had effectively criminalised their communities by removing local authorities' responsibility to provide sites, thus leaving the travellers with no option but to purchase unregistered new sites themselves. Law enforcement agencies in the United States hold regular conferences on the Roma and similar nomadic groups. In Denmark, there was much controversy when the city of Helsing√∏r decided to put all Romani students in special classes in its public schools. The classes were later abandoned after it was determined that they were discriminatory and the Romani students were put back in regular classes. Romani people avoid gadje because non-Romani are believed to be polluting and defile the Romani world.  Roma in Eastern Europe  Romani boy in bear costume, part of entertainer team for working Christmas crowds. Budapest, Hungary. In Eastern Europe, Roma often live in depressed squatter communities with very high unemployment, while only some are fully integrated in the society. However, in some cases‚Äînotably the Kalderash clan in Romania, who work as traditional coppersmiths‚Äîthey have prospered. Although some Roma still embrace a nomadic lifestyle, most migration is actually forced, as most communities do not accept Romani settlements. However, each year in May approximately 10,000 to 15,000 Romani people go on a pilgrimage to Les- Saintes-Marie-de-la-Mer in Southern France. Roma arrive in caravans for celebrations, weddings and religious ceremonies. Many countries that were formerly part of the Eastern bloc and former Yugoslavia have substantial populations of Roma. The level of integration of Roma into society remains limited. In these countries, they usually remain on the margins of society, living in isolated, ghetto-like settlements (see Ch√°nov). Only a small fraction of Romani children graduate from secondary schools, though numerous official efforts have been made, past and present, to compel their attendance. Roma frequently feel rejected by the state and the main population, creating another obstacle to their integration. In the Czech Republic, 75% of Romani children are educated in schools for people with learning difficulties and 70% are unemployed, compared with a national rate of 9%. In Hungary, 44% of Romani children are in special schools, while 74% of men and 83% of women are unemployed. In Slovakia, Romani children are 28 times more likely to be sent to a special school than non-Roma, whilst Romani unemployment stands at 80%. In 2004, L√≠via J√°r√≥ka and Vikt√≥ria Moh√°csi of Hungary became the two current Romani Members of the European Parliament. The first Romani MEP was Juan de Dios Ram√≠rez Heredia of Spain. Seven former Communist Central European and Southeastern European states launched the Decade of Roma Inclusion initiative in 2005 to improve the socioeconomic conditions and status of the Romani minority.

It counts the number of cycles since reset. The instruction \`RDTSC\` returns the TSC in EDX:EAX. In x86-64 mode, \`RDTSC\` also clears the higher 32 bits of RAX and RDX. Its opcode is \`0F 31\`. Pentium competitors such as the Cyrix 6x86 did not always have a TSC and may consider \`RDTSC\` an illegal instruction. Cyrix included a Time Stamp Counter in their MII. Use The Time Stamp Counter was once an excellent high-resolution, low-overhead way for a program to get CPU timing information. With the advent of multi-core/hyper-threaded CPUs, systems with multiple CPUs, and hibernating operating systems, the TSC cannot be relied upon to provide accurate results ‚Äî unless great care is taken to correct the possible flaws: rate of tick and whether all cores (processors) have identical values in their time-keeping registers. There is no promise that the timestamp counters of multiple CPUs on a single motherboard will be synchronized. Therefore, a program can get reliable results only by limiting itself to run on one specific CPU. Even then, the CPU speed may change because of power-saving measures taken by the OS or BIOS, or the system may be hibernated and later resumed, resetting the TSC. In those latter cases, to stay relevant, the program must re-calibrate the counter periodically. Relying on the TSC also reduces portability, as other processors may not have a similar feature. Recent Intel processors include a constant rate TSC (identified by the kern.timecounter.invariant_tsc sysctl on FreeBSD or by the \\"\`constant_tsc\`\\" flag in Linux's \`/proc/cpuinfo\`). With these processors, the TSC ticks at the processor's nominal frequency, regardless of the actual CPU clock frequency due to turbo or power saving states. Hence TSC ticks are counting the passage of time, not the number of CPU clock cycles elapsed. On Windows platforms, Microsoft strongly discourages using the TSC for high-resolution timing for exactly these reasons, providing instead the Windows APIs \`QueryPerformanceCounter\` and \`QueryPerformanceFrequency\`. On POSIX systems, a program can get similar function by reading the value of \`CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW\` clock using the \`clock_gettime\` function. Starting with the Pentium Pro, Intel processors have practiced out-of-order execution, where instructions are not necessarily performed in the order they appear in the program. This can cause the processor to execute \`RDTSC\` earlier than a simple program expects, producing a misleading cycle count. The programmer can solve this problem by inserting a serializing instruction, such as CPUID, to force every preceding instruction to complete before allowing the program to continue, or by using the \`RDTSCP\` instruction, which is a serializing variant of the \`RDTSC\` instruction. Implementation in various processors Intel processor families increment the time-stamp counter differently: * For Pentium M processors (family [06H], models [09H, 0DH]); for Pentium 4 processors, Intel Xeon processors (family [0FH], models [00H, 01H, or 02H]); and for P6 family processors: the time- stamp counter increments with every internal processor clock cycle. The internal processor clock cycle is determined by the current core-clock to busclock ratio. Intel SpeedStep technology transitions may also impact the processor clock. * For Pentium 4 processors, Intel Xeon processors (family [0FH], models [03H and higher]); for Intel Core Solo and Intel Core Duo processors (family [06H], model [0EH]); for the Intel Xeon processor 5100 series and Intel Core 2 Duo processors (family [06H], model [0FH]); for Intel Core 2 and Intel Xeon processors (family [06H], display_model [17H]); for Intel Atom processors (family [06H], display_model [1CH]): the time-stamp counter increments at a constant rate. That rate may be set by the maximum core-clock to bus-clock ratio of the processor or may be set by the maximum resolved frequency at which the processor is booted. The maximum resolved frequency may differ from the maximum qualified frequency of the processor. The specific processor configuration determines the behavior. Constant TSC behavior ensures that the duration of each clock tick is uniform and makes it possible to use of the TSC as a wall clock timer even if the processor core changes frequency. This is the architectural behavior for all later Intel processors. AMD processors up to the K8 core always incremented the time-stamp counter every clock cycle. Thus, power management features were able to change the number of increments per second, and the values could get out of sync between different cores or processors in the same system. For Windows, AMD provides a utility to periodically synchronize the counters on multiple core CPUs. Since the family 10h (Barcelona/Phenom), AMD chips feature a constant TSC, which can be driven either by the HyperTransport speed or the highest P state. A CPUID bit (\`Fn8000_0007:EDX_8\`) advertises this; Intel-CPUs also report their invariant TSC on that bit. Operating system use An operating system may provide methods that both use and don't use the \`RDTSC\` instruction for time keeping, under administrator control. For example, on some versions of the Linux kernel, seccomp sandboxing mode disables \`RDTSC\`. It can also be disabled using the \`PR_SET_TSC\` argument to the \`prctl()\` system call.  Use in exploiting cache side-channel attacks  The time stamp counter can be used to time instructions accurately which can be exploited in the Meltdown and Spectre security vulnerabilities. However if this is not available other counters or timers can be used, as is the case with the ARM processors vulnerable to this type of attack. Other architectures Other processors also have registers which count CPU clock cycles, but with different names. For instance, on the AVR32, it is called the Performance Clock Counter (PCCNT) register. SPARC V9 provides the \`TICK\` register. ARMv7 and ARMv8 architectures provide a generic counter which counts at a constant frequency. PowerPC provides the 64-bit \`TBR\` register.

It was hosted by Melinda Messenger and assisted by Freddie Starr. The show was noted for its bizarre end game, which featured two couples gambling their cars for the chance to win a new one. The winning team received the new car, while the losing couple's car was dropped into a car crusher (or more specifically, a modified Lefort Mobile Baler) and destroyed, with their bus fare home being given as a consolation prize. Format The show usually begin with an audience member being called out, and a large item of personal value being put in the crusher, such as a garden shed or a kebab trailer. In one episode, a man was asked to sing one of his favourite songs to stop his garden shed from being crushed. After he had sung the song, the shed was crushed anyway. After the show opener, there would be a competition to find the \\"coolest\\" man in wherever that particular show was being held, such as Wood Green or Port Talbot. There would be three contestants who claimed to be the coolest man in their town; they would then go through a scientific \\"test\\" to find the coolest man. The men would be connected to heart monitors and a scary story would be told, during which Freddie would usually perform actions appropriate to the story, such as hitting one of the men over the head with a tray or making noises to simulate thunder and wind, pouring tomato ketchup over someone's head to simulate blood, or pouring ice down the back of someone to stimulate chills. The man with the lowest heart rate would be claimed the coolest man in the area and would receive a cloak and giant medallion. Then, the 'Babies Win Prizes' contest would follow. The contest featured nine toddlers and one of their parents competing to win a toy car. Three heats would be held to narrow the number of toddlers and parents down to three; the toddlers would have to take part in certain challenges, such as: * Snooker Loopy: The toddlers would have to throw as many custard pies as possible at their parents' faces. The toddler who threw the most would win the heat. * Yeehaw: The toddlers would have to ride on their parents' backs and lasso cans off of several fences. The one who knocked off the most would win the heat. * Joey the Clown: Using make up, the toddlers would have to make their parents look like a picture of a clown. The one who got the closest to the picture would win the heat. The heats were followed by the 'Clash of the Clans' contest. This consisted of two families competing to win a giant trophy, usually manufactured by a nearby steelworks factory, in a talent contest. The round required the demonstration of various talents, such as dancing, singing, and stand-up comedy. There were three judges with buzzers; if all three buzzers were pressed, the contestant would have to leave the stage. The family who spent the most time on stage would win the trophy. The show would then return to the Babies Win Prizes semi-final. The three winners of the heats would then compete in a semi-final. One of the semi-final challenges was called \\"Ready, Steady, Blaghh!\\". In this challenge the toddlers had to feed their parents freezing cold food (which the commentator joked that he had cooked himself). The two toddlers who fed their parents the most would get through to the final. The losers were given a goody bag and certificate. Then, the final event, \\"Beat the Crusher\\", would begin. All the number plates in the car park outside the studio would be entered into a computer, two number plates would be selected at random, and the couple to whom the car belonged would have to play the game. While the couples prepared, the show returned to Babies Win Prizes for the final. In the babies' final the two remaining toddlers would have to go through an obstacle course; the one who completed the course in the fastest time would win the toy car, and the runner-up would win a bike. Then \\"Beat the Crusher\\" began. The two couples, now ready for the game, would have to answer multiple-choice general-knowledge questions. If a couple got a question wrong, their car would move up a level on a moving platform and closer to the crusher. If they got the question right, the opposing couple's car would move up a level. If they got a question wrong when they were above the crusher, known as the 'Danger Zone', or the opposing team got a question right, the loser's car was dropped into the crusher and destroyed. The owners received bus fare home as a consolation prize. The winning couple would then have a choice of two new cars, either a luxury estate car or a stylish four-door saloon.

Walker was born in Preston, Lancashire, England, the son of corn miller and merchant Thomas Walker, and Ellen n√©e Eccles. He was educated at Leyland Grammar School, then worked as a schoolteacher at Preston for two years. He then emigrated to Canada, where he worked as a farmhand and chemist's assistant. After returning to the United Kingdom he work as a journalist on the Preston Herald. He later spent some time in Toledo, Ohio, U.S., where he spent 1876 lecturing on evolution and the occult. The following year he toured through New South Wales, England and South Africa, lecturing on spiritualism and politics. While in South Africa in 1881, he married Andrietta Maria Somers, with whom he would have two sons and two daughters. Walker returned to Australia in 1882, spending some time in Victoria before settling in New South Wales. He became a prominent public figure through his political lectures, in which he argued for secularism and an immediate separation of New South Wales from England. In February 1885 he played a prominent role in a meeting held to discuss British government policy towards the Pacific Islands, and shortly afterwards he was involved in opposing the deployment of New South Wales troops to the Sudan. On 17 February 1887 Walker was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Northumberland as a Protectionist. He continued to push for separation from England, helping to form the short-lived Republican Union and Republican League. He held his Legislative Assembly seat until the election of 25 June 1894, when he unsuccessfully contested the seat of Wallsend. He contested the seat again the following year without success. Some time after 1894, Walker visited New Zealand, where he taught elocution, promoted temperance, lectured on various subjects, and wrote for the press. On returning to New South Wales he unsuccessfully contested the seat of Sturt in 1898. In 1899, Walker emigrated to Western Australia. He found work as a journalist with the Sunday Times in Perth, and later with the Kalgoorlie newspapers Sun and Kalgoorlie Miner. He became editor of the Sunday Times in 1901, and was also editor of the Sun until 1905. On 27 October 1905, Walker was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly seat of Kanowna on a Labor ticket. He would hold the seat until his death over 25 years later. From around 1906 he began studying law, and in 1911 was admitted to the Western Australian bar. He was a member of the Senate of the University of Western Australia from 1912 to 1916. When the Labor party won government under John Scaddan on 7 October 1911, Walker was appointed Minister for Justice and Education, and Attorney General. He held both portfolios until the Scaddan government's defeat on 27 July 1916. He was Speaker of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly from 24 July 1924 to 29 July 1930. He died at Inglewood on 10 May 1932, and was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery.

In statistical mechanics, the radial distribution function, (or pair correlation function) g(r) in a system of particles (atoms, molecules, colloids, etc.), describes how density varies as a function of distance from a reference particle. If a given particle is taken to be at the origin O, and if \\\\rho =N/V is the average number density of particles, then the local time- averaged density at a distance r from O is \\\\rho g(r). This simplified definition holds for a homogeneous and isotropic system. A more general case will be considered below. In simplest terms it is a measure of the probability of finding a particle at a distance of r away from a given reference particle, relative to that for an ideal gas. The general algorithm involves determining how many particles are within a distance of r and r+dr away from a particle. This general theme is depicted to the right, where the red particle is our reference particle, and blue particles are those whose centers are within the circular shell, dotted in orange. The radial distribution function is usually determined by calculating the distance between all particle pairs and binning them into a histogram. The histogram is then normalized with respect to an ideal gas, where particle histograms are completely uncorrelated. For three dimensions, this normalization is the number density of the system ( \\\\rho ) multiplied by the volume of the spherical shell, which symbolically can be expressed as \\\\rho \\\\, 4\\\\pi r^2 dr. Given a potential energy function, the radial distribution function can be computed either via computer simulation methods like the Monte Carlo method, or via the Ornstein-Zernike equation, using approximative closure relations like the Percus-Yevick approximation or the Hypernetted Chain Theory. It can also be determined experimentally, by radiation scattering techniques or by direct visualization for large enough (micrometer-sized) particles via traditional or confocal microscopy. The radial distribution function is of fundamental importance since it can be used, using the Kirkwood‚ÄìBuff solution theory, to link the microscopic details to macroscopic properties. Moreover, by the reversion of the Kirkwood-Buff theory, it is possible to attain the microscopic details of the radial distribution function from the macroscopic properties. Definition Consider a system of N particles in a volume V (for an average number density \\\\rho =N/V) and at a temperature T (let us also define \\\\textstyle \\\\beta = \\\\frac{1}{kT}). The particle coordinates are \\\\mathbf{r}_{i}, with \\\\textstyle i = 1, \\\\, \\\\ldots, \\\\, N. The potential energy due to the interaction between particles is \\\\textstyle U_{N} (\\\\mathbf{r}_{1}\\\\, \\\\ldots, \\\\, \\\\mathbf{r}_{N}) and we do not consider the case of an externally applied field. The appropriate averages are taken in the canonical ensemble (N,V,T), with \\\\textstyle Z_{N} = \\\\int \\\\cdots \\\\int \\\\mathrm{e}^{-\\\\beta U_{N}} \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf{r}_1 \\\\cdots \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf{r}_N the configurational integral, taken over all possible combinations of particle positions. The probability of an elementary configuration, namely finding particle 1 in \\\\textstyle \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf{r}_1, particle 2 in \\\\textstyle \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf{r}_2, etc. is given by }{Z_N} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf{r}_1 \\\\cdots \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf{r}_N\\\\, .|}} The total number of particles is huge, so that P^{(N)} in itself is not very useful. However, one can also obtain the probability of a reduced configuration, where the positions of only n < N particles are fixed, in \\\\textstyle \\\\mathbf{r}_{1}\\\\, \\\\ldots, \\\\, \\\\mathbf{r}_{n}, with no constraints on the remaining N-n particles. To this end, one has to integrate () over the remaining coordinates \\\\mathbf{r}_{n+1}\\\\, \\\\ldots, \\\\, \\\\mathbf{r}_{N}: : P^{(n)}(\\\\mathbf{r}_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\mathbf{r}_n) =\\\\frac{1}{Z_N} \\\\int \\\\cdots \\\\int \\\\mathrm{e}^{-\\\\beta U_N} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf{r}_{n+1} \\\\cdots \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf{r}_N \\\\, .

From () and () it follows that Relations involving g(r) The structure factor The second-order correlation function g^{(2)}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{1},\\\\mathbf{r}_{2}) is of special importance, as it is directly related (via a Fourier transform) to the structure factor of the system and can thus be determined experimentally using X-ray diffraction or neutron diffraction. If the system consists of spherically symmetric particles, g^{(2)}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{1},\\\\mathbf{r}_{2}) depends only on the relative distance between them, \\\\mathbf{r}_{12} = \\\\mathbf{r}_{2} - \\\\mathbf{r}_{1} . We will drop the sub- and superscript: \\\\textstyle g(\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\equiv g^{(2)}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{12}). Taking particle 0 as fixed at the origin of the coordinates, \\\\textstyle \\\\rho g(\\\\mathbf{r}) d^3r = \\\\mathrm{d} n (\\\\mathbf{r}) is the average number of particles (among the remaining N-1) to be found in the volume \\\\textstyle d^3r around the position \\\\textstyle \\\\mathbf{r}. We can formally count these particles and take the average via the expression \\\\textstyle \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} n (\\\\mathbf{r})}{d^3r} = \\\\langle \\\\sum_{i eq 0} \\\\delta ( \\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_i) \\\\rangle, with \\\\textstyle \\\\langle \\\\cdot \\\\rangle the ensemble average, yielding: where the second equality requires the equivalence of particles \\\\textstyle 1, \\\\, \\\\ldots, \\\\, N-1. The formula above is useful for relating g(\\\\mathbf{r}) to the static structure factor S(\\\\mathbf{q}), defined by \\\\textstyle S(\\\\mathbf{q}) = \\\\langle \\\\sum_{ij} \\\\mathrm{e}^{-i \\\\mathbf{q} (\\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{r}_j)} \\\\rangle /N, since we have: : \\\\begin{align} S(\\\\mathbf{q}) &= 1 + \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\langle \\\\sum_{i eq j} \\\\mathrm{e}^{-i \\\\mathbf{q} (\\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{r}_j)} \\\\rangle = 1 + \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\int_V \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{e}^{-i \\\\mathbf{q} \\\\mathbf{r}} \\\\sum_{i eq j} \\\\delta \\\\left [ \\\\mathbf{r} - (\\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{r}_j) \\\\right ] \\\\right \\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= 1+ \\\\frac{N(N-1)}{N} \\\\int_V \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf{r}\\\\, \\\\mathrm{e}^{-i \\\\mathbf{q} \\\\mathbf{r}} \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\delta ( \\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_1 ) \\\\right \\\\rangle \\\\end{align} , and thus: S(\\\\mathbf{q}) = 1 + \\\\rho \\\\int_V \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{e}^{-i \\\\mathbf{q} \\\\mathbf{r}} g(\\\\mathbf{r}), proving the Fourier relation alluded to above. This equation is only valid in the sense of distributions, since g(\\\\mathbf{r}) is not normalized: \\\\textstyle \\\\lim_{r \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} g(\\\\mathbf{r}) = 1, so that \\\\textstyle \\\\int_V \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf{r} g(\\\\mathbf{r}) diverges as the volume V, leading to a Dirac peak at the origin for the structure factor. Since this contribution is inaccessible experimentally we can subtract it from the equation above and redefine the structure factor as a regular function: : S'(\\\\mathbf{q}) = S(\\\\mathbf{q}) - \\\\rho \\\\delta (\\\\mathbf{q})= 1 + \\\\rho \\\\int_V \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{e}^{-i \\\\mathbf{q}\\\\mathbf{r}} [g(\\\\mathbf{r}) - 1]. Finally, we rename S(\\\\mathbf{q}) \\\\equiv S'(\\\\mathbf{q}) and, if the system is a liquid, we can invoke its isotropy: [g(r) - 1] = 1 + 4\\\\pi\\\\rho\\\\frac{1}{q} \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d} r \\\\, r\\\\, \\\\mathrm{sin}(qr) [g(r) - 1].|}} The compressibility equation Evaluating () in q=0 and using the relation between the isothermal compressibility \\\\textstyle \\\\chi _T and the structure factor at the origin yields the compressibility equation: The potential of mean force It can be shown that the radial distribution function is related to the two-particle potential of mean force w^{(2)}(r) by: In the dilute limit, the potential of mean force is the exact pair potential under which the equilibrium point configuration has a given g(r). The energy equation If the particles interact via identical pairwise potentials: \\\\textstyle U_{N} = \\\\sum_{i > j = 1}^N u(\\\\left \\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{r}_j \\\\right |), the average internal energy per particle is: The pressure equation of state Developing the virial equation yields the pressure equation of state: Thermodynamic properties in 3D The radial distribution function is an important measure because several key thermodynamic properties, such as potential energy and pressure can be calculated from it. For a 3-D system where particles interact via pairwise potentials, the potential energy of the system can be calculated as follows: PE=\\\\frac{N}{2}4\\\\pi\\\\rho\\\\int^{\\\\infty}_0r^2u(r)g(r)dr Where N is the number of particles in the system, \\\\rho is the number density, u(r) is the pair potential. The pressure of the system can also be calculated by relating the 2nd virial coefficient to g(r) . The pressure can be calculated as follows: P = \\\\rho k_BT-\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\pi\\\\rho^2\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty}dr\\\\frac{du(r)}{dr}r^3g(r) Where T is the temperature and k_B is Boltzmann's constant. Note that the results of potential and pressure will not be as accurate as directly calculating these properties because of the averaging involved with the calculation of g(r). Approximations For dilute systems (e.g. gases), the correlations in the positions of the particles that g(r) accounts for are only due to the potential u(r) engendered by the reference particle, neglecting indirect effects. In the first approximation, it is thus simply given by the Boltzmann distribution law: If u(r) were zero for all r - i.e., if the particles did not exert any influence on each other, then g(r) = 1 for all \\\\mathbf{r} and the mean local density would be equal to the mean density \\\\rho: the presence of a particle at O would not influence the particle distribution around it and the gas would be ideal. For distances r such that u(r) is significant, the mean local density will differ from the mean density \\\\rho, depending on the sign of u(r) (higher for negative interaction energy and lower for positive u(r)). As the density of the gas increases, the low-density limit becomes less and less accurate since a particle situated in \\\\mathbf{r} experiences not only the interaction with the particle in O but also with the other neighbours, themselves influenced by the reference particle. This mediated interaction increases with the density, since there are more neighbours to interact with: it makes physical sense to write a density expansion of g(r), which resembles the virial equation: This similarity is not accidental; indeed, substituting () in the relations above for the thermodynamic parameters (Equations , and ) yields the corresponding virial expansions. The auxiliary function y(r) is known as the cavity distribution function. It has been shown that for classical fluids at a fixed density and a fixed positive temperature, the effective pair potential that generates a given g(r) under equilibrium is unique up to an additive constant, if it exists. In recent years, some attention has been given to develop Pair Correlation Functions for spatially- discrete data such as lattices or networks. Experimental One can determine g(r) indirectly (via its relation with the structure factor S(q)) using neutron scattering or x-ray scattering data. The technique can be used at very short length scales (down to the atomic level) but involves significant space and time averaging (over the sample size and the acquisition time, respectively). In this way, the radial distribution function has been determined for a wide variety of systems, ranging from liquid metals to charged colloids. Going from the experimental S(q) to g(r) is not straightforward and the analysis can be quite involved. It is also possible to calculate g(r) directly by extracting particle positions from traditional or confocal microscopy. This technique is limited to particles large enough for optical detection (in the micrometer range), but it has the advantage of being time-resolved so that, aside from the statical information, it also gives access to dynamical parameters (e.g. diffusion constants) and also space- resolved (to the level of the individual particle), allowing it to reveal the morphology and dynamics of local structures in colloidal crystals, glasses,M.I.

Higher-order correlation functions Higher-order distribution functions \\\\textstyle g^{(k)} with \\\\textstyle k > 2 were less studied, since they are generally less important for the thermodynamics of the system; at the same time, they are not accessible by conventional scattering techniques. They can however be measured by coherent X-ray scattering and are interesting insofar as they can reveal local symmetries in disordered systems. References * Widom, B. (2002).

He accepted early retirement in 1997, following budget cutbacks that he argued were political in nature.Murray Lyons, \\"Politics caused police cuts: ex-cop\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 14 October 1997, A5. Maddin received certification as a private investigator in March 2006.Darren Bernhardt, \\"New career: Maddin, P.I.: Ex-mayor, former police officer becomes city gumshoe\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 17 March 2006, A1. Councillor Maddin entered political life later in 1997, narrowly defeating former councillor Glen Penner to win election for Saskatoon City Council's first ward.Murray Lyons, \\"Electorate fails to show\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 23 October 1997, A1. He focused his campaign on restoring public confidence in the police service, and was appointed to the city's Police Services Board after the election.Murray Lyons, \\"Candidates for City Council: Ward One\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 20 October 1997, D1; Murray Lyons, \\"Former officer joins police board\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 13 December 1997, A13. Maddin promoted closer ties between the police and the city's aboriginal community in 2000, following allegations that two Saskatoon police officers may have abandoned an aboriginal man, Neil Stonechild, to freeze to death at the edge of the city.Kim McNairn, \\"Police, Natives need stronger ties: Maddin, FSIN\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 26 February 2000, A5. A liberal on social issues, he supported a $2000 payment to the United Way to promote non-discrimination against gay and lesbian people in 1998.Kim McNairn, \\"City hopes grant quells gay complaint\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 2 December 1998, A3. Mayor Maddin campaigned for Mayor of Saskatoon in 2000, and was elected in an upset over four-term incumbent Henry Dayday. His candidacy was endorsed by the Coalition of Progressive Electorates, and was fifty-two years old at the time.Kim McNairn, \\"Election coalition's secrecy angers mayoralty candidate\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 25 October 2000, A7; Kim McNairn, \\"Meet your Mayor: From backwoods upbringing to city's top job, Maddin retraces steps along path to latest triumph\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 27 October 2000, A1. Maddin's tenure as mayor was marked by several controversies involving police issues. He supported a review of the city's police services while campaigning for office in 2000, and was openly critical of police chief Dave Scott's management of the force.Randy Burton, \\"Police service big issue for Maddin\\", Saskatoon Star- Phoenix, 7 October 2000, A2. Shortly after the election, the outgoing police services commission from the previous council voted to renew Scott's contract for a three-year period. Some in the local media described this decision as undemocratic, and as a defiance of Maddin's popular mandate.\\"Scott decision high-handed\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 22 December 2000, A14. Following a brief period of cohabitation, the city exercised a clause in Scott's contract to remove him from office in June 2001. Maddin supported Scott's departure, arguing that it was necessary to ensure \\"a new direction for policing in Saskatoon\\".Lori Coolican, \\"Chief's firing shocks cops: Scott out of sync with new board's vision for future, commission says\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 23 June 2001, A1. Russell Sabo was hired to replace Scott later in the year.Kim McNairn, \\"Top cop rides in from West: Board hires Calgary officer schooled in community policing\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 2 November 2001, A1. Scott's dismissal was controversial in the city, and provoked antagonisms between Maddin and the city's police association.See for instance Mark Taylor, \\"Police shun association over Maddin endorsement\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 18 October 2003, A3. At one stage, the police association voted 93% non-confidence in Scott's replacement. Maddin instituted policies of \\"community policing\\" during his time in office, wherein police officers set up 'neighborhood shops' to encourage public cooperation in targeting crime. The measure was enacted, in part, to improve ties between the police and Saskatchewan's aboriginal community. After leaving office in 2003, Maddin argued that the McNab Park area of Saskatoon saw a 38% crime reduction as a result of the policy. He also expressed concern that the new city administration would dismantle the initiative.Shauna Rempel, \\"Beware of new vision for police, Maddin warns\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 17 November 2003. Maddin also supported efforts by the Saskatchewan Indian Gaming Authority (SIGA) to open a casino in Saskatoon, arguing that it would generate $1.5 million annually in property taxes while providing a financial benefit to the city's aboriginal community.Darren Bernhardt, \\"Cash in or lose benefits of new casino: Maddin\\", Saskatoon Star- Phoenix, 12 December 2002, A1. Many city residents opposed this initiative, however, and there was credible speculation that it would be defeated by a plebiscite. In August 2003, the Saskatoon Tribal Council decided that it could not be assured of popular support in Saskatoon, and shifted its bid to the Whitecap Dakota-Sioux First Nation south of the city.Rob Nickel and James Parker, \\"Downtown casino not in the cards: Focus shifts to Whitecap reserve\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 22 August 2003, A1. Throughout the controversy, Maddin suggested that some opposition to the casino was grounded in racial prejudice.Darren Bernhardt, \\"Scaddan gets show of support: Mayor, colleagues back Partnership director's charge of racism\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 1 February 2003, A3. A poll taken in early October 2003 showed Maddin with a lead over all challengers in his bid for re-election, and he was given official support from the Association of Civic Employees later in the same month.Gerry Klein, \\"Maddin ahead: Poll\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 10 October 2003, A1; Mark Taylor, \\"Police shun association over Maddin endorsement\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 18 October 2003, A3. Ongoing controversies over the police and casino issues eroded his popularity, however, and he was sometimes depicted as lacking strong leadership on crime issues.Rod Nickel, \\"Atchison support was citywide\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 24 October 2003, A1. He unexpectedly finished fourth against longtime rival Don Atchison, as well as behind Peter Zakreski and Jim Pankiw. Federal politics After leaving the mayor's office, Maddin speculated about turning to federal politics as a candidate of the Liberals or New Democratic Party.Rod Nickel, \\"Maddin eyes run at federal politics\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 28 October 2003, A1. He joined the NDP in early 2004 and sought the party's nomination for Saskatoon‚ÄîWanuskewin in the 2004 federal election, but lost to rival candidate Priscilla Settee.Darren Bernhardt, \\"Maddin 'crushed' at ballot box\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 29 March 2004, A3. He campaigned for the Saskatoon‚ÄîWanuskewin nomination again for the 2006 election, and this time was selected by the party. He finished third against Conservative incumbent Maurice Vellacott in the general election. Return to local politics Maddin ran again for mayor of Saskatoon in the 2006 elections, and finished fourth against Atchison. In 2009, Maddin was elected mayor of the town of Asquith, Saskatchewan. He resigned on March 11, 2015.

Lovecraft, written in 1918 and first published in the December 1920 issue of the amateur journal The Philosopher. It is the story that introduces Lovecraft's fictional Pnakotic Manuscripts, the first of his arcane tomes. In the story, an unnamed narrator describes his nightly obsession with the Pole star, and his recurring dreams of a city under siege. The narrator struggles with determining whether his reality is real, or if his dream is the true reality. Critics have noted autobiographical elements in the story, and have connected it with Lovecraft's experiences of uselessness during World War I. Plot The story begins with the narrator describing the night sky as observed over long sleepless nights from his window, in particular that of the Pole Star, Polaris, which he describes as \\"winking hideously like an insane watching eye which strives to convey some strange message, yet recalls nothing save that it once had a message to convey\\". He then describes the night of the aurora over his house in the swamp, and how on this night he first dreamed of a city of marble lying on a plateau between two peaks, with Polaris above in the night sky. The narrator describes after a while observing motion within the houses and seeing men beginning to populate the streets, conversing to each other in language that he had never heard before but still, strangely, understood. However, before he could learn any more of this city, he awoke. Many times, he would again dream of the city and the men who dwelt within. After a while, the narrator tired of merely existing as an incorporeal observer and began to desire to establish his place within the city, simultaneously beginning to question his conceptualization of what constituted reality and thus whether this was just a dream or whether it was real. Then, one night, while listening to discourses of those who populate the city, the narrator obtains a physical form: not as a stranger, but as an inhabitant of the city, which he now knew as Olatho√´, lying on the plateau of Sarkis in the land of Lomar, which was besieged by an enemy known as the Inutos. While the other men within the city engage in combat with Inutos, the narrator is sent to a watchtower to signal if the Inutos gain access to the city itself. Within the tower, he notices Polaris in the sky and senses it as a malign presence, hearing a rhyme which appears to be spoken by the star: Uncertain as to its meaning, he drifts off to sleep, thus failing in his duty to guard Olatho√´. Upon awakening, the narrator finds himself back in the house by the swamp, but the narrator now is convinced that this life is not real but a dream from which he cannot awaken. Inspiration Critic William Fulwiler writes that \\"'Polaris' is one of Lovecraft's most autobiographical stories, reflecting his feelings of guilt, frustration, and uselessness during World War I. Like the narrator, Lovecraft was 'denied a warrior's part', for he 'was feeble and given to strange faintings when subjected to stress and hardships'\\".William Fulwiler, \\"Mail- Call of Cthulhu\\", Black Forbidden Things, p. 171; citing H. P. Lovecraft, \\"Polaris\\", Dagon and Other Macabre Tales, p. 21. Like many Lovecraft stories, \\"Polaris\\" was in part inspired by a dream, which he described in a letter: \\"Several nights ago I had a strange dream of a strange city--a city of many palaces and gilded domes, lying in a hollow betwixt ranges of grey, horrible hills.... I was, as I said, aware of this city visually. I was in it and around it. But certainly I had no corporeal existence.\\"H. P. Lovecraft, Selected Letters Vol. I, p. 62; cited in Joshi and Schultz, p. 211. Lovecraft remarked on the peculiar similarity of the story's style to that of Lord Dunsany, whose work he would not read for another year. An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia suggests that Lovecraft and Dunsany were both influenced by the prose poems of Edgar Allan Poe.Joshi and Schultz, p. 211. Publication \\"Polaris\\" was first published in the December 1920 edition of The Philosopher, an amateur journal. It was later reprinted the May 1926 edition of the National Amateur, the February 1934 issue of Fantasy Fan, and the December 1937 issue of Weird Tales.

The original frame courthouse was built in 1840 and later moved to Greenfield Village in Michigan; the current courthouse, which is a close replica of the first, was built in 1953. The building's unusual history is derived from its status as one of the courthouses used by lawyer Abraham Lincoln as he traveled the circuit of courtrooms in central Illinois. The courthouse replica is operated by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. The courthouse Original courthouse as reassembled in Greenfield Village, Dearborn, Michigan Postville, a frontier settlement, was founded in 1835 by Russell Post. In 1839, the Illinois General Assembly chartered a new county from territory undergoing settlement. The new county was named Logan, and the county's first commissioners chose Postville, located close to the center of the new county, as the county seat. A simple frame courthouse was raised in the following year. Built in an austere Federal style, the new courthouse resembled a private home. It contained not only a circuit courtroom, but also offices for the county clerk, the sheriff, the county recorder of deeds, the coroner, and the county surveyor. In addition, the county board of commissioners and the justice of the peace sat in the courtroom during their times of duty. The Postville Courthouse served the people of Logan County for only eight years, from 1840 until 1848. In the latter year, the people of a nearby town, Mount Pulaski, Illinois, offered to take over the county seat in exchange for building a brick courthouse for the county's use. Concerned about the possibility of a courthouse fire and the destruction of the county's legal records, the county's leaders accepted the offer. The new courthouse, which still survives, is now the Mount Pulaski Courthouse State Historic Site. Abraham Lincoln After seven years in Mount Pulaski from 1848 until 1855, the county seat was moved to a site by the newly built Chicago and Alton Railroad tracks. The new county seat, which was close to Postville, was named Lincoln, Illinois after the central Illinois lawyer. A fire in Lincoln in 1857 did indeed destroy Logan County's court records. As a result, little is known about the legal cases at Postville in which Lincoln was involved. During the active use of the Postville courthouse, Lincoln was a young lawyer who was struggling to make a name for himself. The state of Illinois law at that time did not encourage specialization, and Lincoln would have taken any case for which he was hired. Although law on the frontier was competitive, Lincoln made many friends in Logan County at this time. In 1846, the people of Central Illinois elected him to serve a term in the U.S. House of Representatives, and in 1853, the people of central Logan County named their new county seat for him. The new town of Lincoln grew so fast that by the 1860s, it had swallowed up nearby Postville, which was annexed and ceased to exist as an autonomous municipality. Neighbors of the old Postville courthouse passed down stories. One well-corroborated tale says that the field across from the courthouse, then a vacant lot, was used by Lincoln and other young lawyers as a place to play town ball, a 19th-century variety of baseball, while the counselors were waiting for their cases to come up on the docket. Later history After Postville became a neighborhood of Lincoln, the courthouse became a private home and gradually faded in importance. In 1929, inventor Henry Ford, eager to buy historic old buildings, purchased the old structure for $8,000. His contractors dismantled the frame structure, dug up the foundation, and moved everything to the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan; the reconstructed Postville Courthouse, built with original materials, still stands in Michigan today. The people of Lincoln were troubled by losing this item from their heritage, and asked the state of Illinois to try to make up part of the loss. The state built a replica courthouse in 1953, using the dimensions and data of the original building. This replica, furnished as a courtroom of the 1840s, serves as the current Postville Courthouse State Historic Site.

The bridge was completed in 1932 at a cost of $4.75 million ($ with inflation). It stands 93 feet (28 meters) above the river's waterline in order to allow shipping to pass unobstructed.

Overview Guests were supposedly interviewed by Gervais in the original television studio chairs of famous people. Gervais was seated in Michael Aspel's Aspel & Co leather chair and guests seated in Ronnie Corbett's monologue chair, and Grandad from Only Fools and Horses' armchair. Each episode has two celebrity guests, and following the interview segments Gervais would host his version of a classic television panel game, with the guests as contestants. The show regularly featured darts assistant Tony Green, who would take his place as the general stooge and gameshow assistant. On the first episode, Gervais joked that Green came free with the original Bullseye dartboard, which he supposedly found himself whilst building the rest of the set. Also, the show did not have a theme tune so at the end of each show, Gervais asked viewers to record and send in their own mixes. Few were received. Two of the episodes used a theme tune co-written and performed by Stewart Ferris and Emma Burgess. Episodes #Tommy Walsh and Jimmy Savile.

Kev was created by Garth Ennis and Glenn Fabry and is a (former) SAS operative who is forever down on his luck. Despite all his training, Kevin is not very muscular or intelligent and is cursed with probably the worst luck of anybody on the Wildstorm Earth. Fictional character biography Life in the army Kev Hawkins lead a rather uneventful life, with no money, no proper education and no significant other. Wanting to escape Luton, Kev joined up with the British Army. It turned out that Kev was rather good at being a soldier and he enjoyed his time, until one day a man caught Kev in bed with his wife. This man later turned out to be Kev's new commanding officer. After the man made Kev pay by putting him on any humiliating assignment and giving him the blame for everything that went wrong in the camp, Kev had enough and joined up with the SAS, the only place his commanding officer couldn't reach him. Motivated by his desire to escape, Kev finished the SAS training and was assigned to various missions. During a mission in Northern Ireland, he had to kill members of both the IRA and the Ulster Defense Association, which meant that assassins from both movements wanted revenge for the rest of his life. Every few weeks or so, Kev gets attacked by a former terrorist or terrorist squads, but escapes unscathed because his assassins tend to suffer strokes from bad luck or take each other out. Kev had a relationship of mutual loathing with Froggett, the British Intelligence official who disposes of all the corpses Kev (and others) make. Kev and three others, including Bob, were assigned to infiltrate a small Iraqi camp, steal a video tape, and leave (And to absolutely under no circumstances view the tape.) After infiltrating the camp, the squad finds the tape only to see it already running in a VCR, which is apparently homemade pornography tape of Saddam Hussein and Margaret Thatcher having sex in the White House. Before they can kill the guard who was watching it, however, they are happened upon and forced to make their escape, only to be inadvertently bombed by a US Air Force jet. One member is captured and tortured while Kev is denied the chance to mount a rescue and turns over the tape. Kev's regiment was once loaned to the Indian government, and the mission saw his friend Danny killing an elephant. Danny had emotional trouble after this and when they later stumbled upon a baby tiger, Danny couldn't obey the order to kill it (as the mother had died, they thought that the baby had no chance of survival on its own). Instead Danny hid it in his backpack and took it home. A few years later, Kev was promoted and given the command over his first operation: protecting a cabinet minister. The cabinet minister in question blackmailed his SAS bodyguards to find him a prostitute - otherwise he would have them fired - and the group decided to take him to Danny's house, the only suitable location. When suspicious figures (who turned out to be tabloid reporters) were spotted, Kev grabbed the minister and locked him inside the basement... the same basement where Danny had hidden his now full- grown tiger. The Minister was swiftly devoured. Kev helped Danny and his tiger to escape before questioning, but remained behind himself, unable to contemplate dropping out of the army and not following orders, and so took the full blame for the minister being eaten. Kev was fired from the SAS and given to MI5 to do every assignment no one else would do. Any complaints from his part would see his superior officer to mention \\"the thing with the tiger\\" and he knew he had no choice but to obey. Meanwhile, it was hinted Danny was now working as an eco-terrorist alongside the very tiger that has caused so much trouble. The Authority In 2002, Kev got assigned the mission to kill the Authority, being handed an old gun and a device that would allow him to teleport to the team's headquarters, Carrier. To the complete surprise of the Authority, who thought it was all a joke, the gun turned out to be capable of killing even the invulnerable Apollo and contained more bullets than it should have, and Kev killed the whole team in twelve seconds. Unfortunately, it turned out that he'd been assigned the mission by an alien masquerading as his boss, all to allow an invasion fleet to attack Earth. Kev then had to convince the sentient Carrier to reverse time to before the Authority died so they could handle the invasion, but before he could escape they discovered that he'd killed them. For a moment it seemed like he would escape unscathed (mainly by being completely pathetic), but an ill-timed remark - \\"what, are they a couple of poofs or something?\\" - about Apollo and the Midnighter earned him the beating of a life-time and Kev ended up in hospital. Two years later, Apollo and Midnighter were forced to contact Kevin again: it turned out the cabinet minister that was eaten had actually been an alien fugitive named B'eeef, and the alien Rukalai, who had just neutralised the rest of the Authority, were threatening to destroy the Earth if he wasn't handed over. Kev and his former SAS mates - Tiny, Mick and Bob - took them to the fetid swamp where Froggett dumped all his bodies, where B'eeef had regrown his head. The team captured B'eeef and defeated all the zombies he'd reanimated, but Kev inadvertently made another attempt on the Authority's life when, coming across a nuclear bomb B'eeef had made, he chucked it through the open Door leading to the Carrier. The Midnighter, annoyed at the bomb destroying \\"all our ****ing stuff\\", later met with Kev and, after arguing with him, told him that the real reason he was a homophobe was because that's what he thought \\"tough guys\\" were like - that all his life, Kev had been letting others tell him how to think. When a mysterious creature appeared on the Carrier in 2005 and took out the Authority by throwing pies at their faces, a heavily wounded Midnighter escaped the Carrier and landed in Britain, sending a request to British Intelligence to have Kev bring him in. Kev, already dealing with the recent suicide of Tiny, reluctantly went but was double crossed by Mick, who was shadowing him. Midnighter had expected this and gave Kev the password to the file Royal Oak; investigating later on, Kev discovered it was a plot to create superhumans for the British government, using the Midnighter's DNA, by experimenting on children; the attack on the Carrier had been the result of a computer virus planted by MI5 in order to capture one of the Authority. Kev went to save the Midnighter and the children and was confronted by Mick, and was shocked to hear that Mick doesn't care about any of this or even about the recent death of Tiny. Kev killed him in a rage and when his boss entered & commanded him to kill the Midnighter and the children, he shot her too. Now a wanted man, he left the kids (who were unbearable brats) at an orphanage and returned with the Midnighter to defeat the creature. Midnighter ordered the Carrier to purge the virus from its memory, revealing the creature to have really been Froggett, using the Carrier's own systems to transform himself in a creature capable of defeating the Authority. Midnighter gave Kev the chance to torture Froggett with a spiked baseball bat and afterwards they threw him out of an airlock. Kev returned to London to have a last drink before starting life on the run, with the Midnighter showing some grudging respect for him changing his ways. After being \\"fired\\" from his job, Kev is blackmailed into leaving the UK with an old pornographic movie he once filmed with a now famous porn star. If it were to be released, it would ruin any chances of him finding any work ever, so he agrees. His ex teammate Bob gives him the address of Danny, now living in the states. Bob is soon murdered by what appears to be a ninja. After arriving in the States, Kev finds his way to Danny, who is now a cannabis growing mountain man, living with his tiger and a woman. Kev soon finds out that the woman is the sister of Danny's lover and that Danny himself is gay. It's soon revealed that the ninja is coming after Kev as well; the guard who was watching the tape is now in a position of power, and wants anyone he thinks has a copy killed, Kev included. Danny is murdered in the ensuing battle, but Kev takes revenge by killing the ninja and executing the former guard one bullet at a time. He then leaves to begin a new life growing cannabis and caring for Danny's tiger with his new girlfriend. Kev's life was later made even more comfortable when the Authority ruled America and legalized cannabis. During the events of World's End storyline, millions of nuclear bombs surrounding Earth explode and cause the Earth's axis to tilt, turning the planet into a post-apocalyptic wasteland in which 90 percent of the human population has been destroyed. Kev's status after World's End remains unknown.

She worked as a physicist at the Center for Space Plasma and Aeronomic Research, University of Alabama in Huntsville, in the 1990s. In 1999, she left the university to form a company, AC Gravity, LLC, to continue anti-gravity research. Anti-gravity claims In a series of papers co- authored with fellow university physicist Douglas Torr and published between 1991 and 1993, she claimed a practical way to produce anti-gravity effects. She claimed that an anti-gravity effect could be produced by rotating ions creating a gravitomagnetic field perpendicular to their spin axis. In her theory, if a large number of ions could be aligned, (in a Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate) the resulting effect would be a very strong gravitomagnetic field producing a strong repulsive force. The alignment may be possible by trapping superconductor ions in a lattice structure in a high-temperature superconducting disc. Li claimed that experimental results confirmed her theories. Her claim of having functional anti-gravity devices was cited by the popular press and in popular science magazines with some enthusiasm at the time. However, in 1997 Li published a paper describing an experiment that showed the effect was very small, if it existed at all. Li is reported to have left the University of Alabama in 1999 to found the company AC Gravity LLC. AC Gravity was awarded a U.S. DOD grant for $448,970 in 2001 to continue anti- gravity research. The grant period ended in 2002 but no results from this research were ever made public. Although no evidence exists that the company ever performed any other work, as of 2020, AC Gravity still remains listed as an \\"existent\\" business.

PornWikiLeaks.com was known for publishing the real names and information of actresses and actors within the pornography industry. When Bang Bros took control of the data and domain, they immediately destroyed and wiped all information associated with the site, which helped to protect associated workers in the pornography industry. On September 15, 2019, Bang Bros made an offer to the Miami Heat to get the naming rights to the arena in which they play. The new name suggested was the Bang Bros Center,Bang Bros Center and while the Heat never officially turned it down, many news outlets picked up the story and it was debated in the press whether they should accept it or not.

Beyond the stomach, the foregut is attached to the abdominal walls by mesentery. The foregut arises from the endoderm, developing from the folding primitive gut, and is developmentally distinct from the midgut and hindgut. Although the term ‚Äúforegut‚Äù is typically used in reference to the anterior section of the primitive gut, components of the adult gut can also be described with this designation. Pain in the epigastric region, just below the intersection of the ribs, typically refers to structures in the adult foregut. Adult foregut Components * Esophagus * Respiratory tract (lower respiratory tract) * Stomach * Duodenum (up to ampulla of vater) * Liver * Gallbladder * Pancreas * Spleen - The spleen arises from the mesodermal dorsal mesentery (the foregut arises from the endoderm not mesoderm). But the spleen shares the same blood supply as many of the mature structures that arise from the foregut (i.e. the celiac artery) Nerve supply The enteric nervous system is one of the major divisions of the nervous system derived from neural crest cells. In mammals, it is composed of large number of interconnected ganglia that are arranged into two concentric rings embedded throughout the gut wall, beginning in the esophagus and ending in the anus. The main function of the ENS is to control the secretory activity of the gastrointestinal glands and peristalsis of the gastrointestinal wall. A large number of organs derived from the developing foregut also receive input from the vagus nerve, which also works in tandem with the ENS to control gastrointestinal function. Development The foregut develops from a cranial region of endoderm created after the initial cephalocaudal folding of the embryo. Starting at the stomodeum, a rapid expansion of the primitive gut forms the esophagus, from which the respiratory bud branches off.Sadler, T.W, (2011) Langman‚Äôs Medical Embryology (12th edition), LWW, Baltimore, MD During early foregut development, the esophagus lengthens considerably, reaching its proportional postnatal size. Simultaneously, the stomach begins to expand in width dorsally and ventrally in an asymmetric manner. This asymmetric expansion creates two curvatures, with the ventral side creating the lesser curvature and the dorsal side creating the greater curvature. The expanding dorsal stomach wall then rotates the on its transverse plane, pulling its caudal portion upward and forcing the upper duodenum into a C shape. This rotation positions the left vagus nerve anteriorly and right vagus nerve posteriorly. While the hindgut and midgut are only attached dorsally to the body wall by a fold of peritoneum, the foregut also has a ventral attachment. Its two attachments are commonly referred to as the dorsal mesogastrium and the ventral mesogastrium. As the stomach rotates during early development, the dorsal and ventral mesentery rotate with it; this rotation produces a space anterior to the expanding stomach called the greater sac, and a space posterior to the stomach called the lesser sac. After this rotation the dorsal mesentery thins and forms the greater omentum, which is attached to the greater curvature of the stomach. The ventral mesentery forms the lesser omentum, and is attached to the developing liver. In the adult, these connective structures of omentum and mesentery form the peritoneum, and act as an insulating and protective layer while also supplying organs with blood and lymph vessels as well as nerves. Arterial supply to all these structures is from the celiac trunk, and venous drainage is by the portal venous system. Lymph from these organs is drained to the prevertebral celiac nodes at the origin of the celiac artery from the aorta. Signalling pathways In vertebrates, functional differentiation continues even after birth, with the transformation into the adult phenotype occurring through epithelial-mesenchymal transition.Sanderson, I. Walker, W.A., (1998) Development of the Gastrointestinal Tract. B.C. Decker Inc, Lewiston, NY Patterning events that determine tissue differentiation in vertebrates rely on several hox genes, the morphogen sonic hedgehog, and transcription factors such as sox2 and sox9.Faure, S. De Santa Barbara, P. (2011) Molecular Embryology of the Foregut, Faure S, De Santa Barbara P. Molecular embryology of the foregut. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition. 52.Suppl 1: S2‚Äì3. PMC. Web. 3 Mar. 2015. Recent research has suggested that most foregut malformations are due to defects in these signalling pathways, with sonic hedgehog gene knockout mice showing phenotypes similar to those seen in patients with esophageal atresia/stenosis, tracheo-esophageal fistula, and respiratory tract anomalies.Litingtung, Y. Lei, L. Westphal, H. Chiang, C. (1998) Sonic Hedgehog is Essential to Foregut Development. Nature Genetics 20, 58 - 61 doi:10.1038/1717 Clinical significance *Esophageal atresia is a congenital defect of the digestive system in which the continuity of the esophageal wall is interrupted. In most cases, the upper esophagus fails to connect with the lower esophagus and stomach.Pansky, B. (1982). Chapter 87: Congenital Malformations of the Digestive System: Foregut Malformations. In Review of medical embryology. New York: Macmillan. *Esophageal stricture is the narrowing of the esophagus resulting in swallowing difficulties. *Pyloric stenosis is the thickening (hypertrophy) of the muscle that forms the pyloric sphincter, obstructing the passage of food. *Biliary atresia is a congenital defect where the common bile duct, which connects the small intestine to the liver, is obstructed or absent. *Pancreatic disease exist as both congenital and acquired diseases. Two of the well known types of congenital defect are: Pancreatic divisum, where the pancreatic duct fails to form, and Annular pancreas, where extra pancreatic tissue grows and wraps around the duodenum leading to obstruction by constriction.

Located on Moredon Road, it served the Fox Chase/Newtown Line. SEPTA closed the station in 1983. History Walnut Hill, and all stations north of Fox Chase, was closed on January 18, 1983, due to failing diesel train equipment that SEPTA had no desire to repair. In addition, a labor dispute began within the SEPTA organization when the transit operator inherited 1,700 displaced employees from Conrail. SEPTA insisted on utilizing transit operators from the Broad Street Subway to operate Fox Chase/Newtown diesel trains, while Conrail requested that railroad motormen run the service. When a federal court ruled that SEPTA had to use Conrail employees in order to offer job assurance, SEPTA canceled Fox Chase- Newtown trains.SEPTA must use Conrail workers rather than its own personnel to run trains over the region's 13 commuter lines, a special federal court has ruled in a decision that offers some job assurance for 1,700 Conrail employees next year. The special court, in an opinion issued Wednesday, ruled that SEPTA had acted legally in October when it replaced Conrail workers with its former subway operators on the line. Service in the diesel-only territory north of Fox Chase was cancelled at that time, and Walnut Hill station still appears in publicly posted tariffs. Although rail service was initially replaced with a Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus, patronage remained light, and the Fox Chase- Newtown shuttle bus service ended in 1999.

It is the sequel to Night of the Demons and was released on home video in 1994 by Republic Pictures Home Video. Lionsgate released it on DVD in 2007; Olive Films released a widescreen DVD and a first time Blu-ray release on February 19, 2013. The film was followed by the 1997 sequel Night of the Demons 3. Plot Six years have passed since the events at Hull House on Halloween, and many of the bodies left at Hull House were recovered except for Angela's; rumor persists she descended bodily into Hell. As it turns out, her parents committed suicide five years later after receiving a Halloween card with Angela's signature. A year later her sister Melissa, nicknamed 'Mouse' (Merle Kennedy), is now staying at St. Rita's Academy, a Catholic boarding school for troubled teenagers. She frequently has nightmares about her sister. Rumors spread around the school regarding Mouse, started by the school bully, Shirley (Zoe Trilling). However, the head nun at the school, Sister Gloria (Jennifer Rhodes), tries to put an end to it. However, Shirley, after getting banned from the school Halloween dance for wrestling on the tennis courts with Kurt (Ladd York) decides to have her own Halloween party at Hull House complete with Mouse and (as a prank) fake carrying out ritual sacrifice she learns from stealing a demonic ritual book from the school brain, Perry (Robert Jayne). Along with her boyfriend Rick (Rick Peters) and Z-Boy (Darin Heames), she tricks Johnny (Johnny Moran), Johnny's girlfriend, Bibi (Cristi Harris), Bibi's friend Terri (Christine Taylor) and Kurt (Ladd York) to get Mouse to go with them to Hull House, awakening a now demonized Angela. After some bizarre incidents, the group flees the house, minus Z-Boy, who is possessed and raped by Angela in the attic. Bibi brings a tube of lipstick out of the house which takes on a hellish life of its own. It quickly possesses Shirley and, one by one, Rick, Z-Boy, Terri and Kurt are possessed and/or murdered by demonic Angela (although Terri is saved when Sister Gloria exorcises the demon inside her with Holy Water). Angela's plan is to sacrifice Mouse to the Devil to prove her devotion to him. Sister Gloria, Johnny, Bibi, Father Bob (Rod McCary) and Perry return to Hull House in an attempt to rescue Melissa. Once arriving at the house, the five become separated and Father Bob is quickly killed by the demonic Rick. Johnny is saved by Perry from the demonic Kurt. Unfortunately, Perry is killed by Z-Boy. With the holy water the group brought, Bibi, Johnny and Sister Gloria kill the remaining demons, except for Angela. After finishing off the demons, the three survivors find Melissa sleeping on an altar. Angela and Sister Gloria debate on what true faith is with Angela stating \\"Real faith can move mountains, your faith can't even move a mouse.\\" Angela then decapitates Sister Gloria but the sister actually pulls her head down into her habit and survives. With one last ruse to save Melissa and the others, Sister Gloria agrees to take her place on the altar. Angela then hands the sword to Melissa, promising her a great source of power if she kills Sister Gloria. However, Melissa turns the tables and stabs Angela instead. Sister Gloria finishes Angela off with a super soaker filled with holy water. As the four try to leave, they are confronted again by Angela, who has taken the form of a Lamia. Angela attacks them but Johnny manages to kick a hole in the wall in the shape of a cross. The cross-shaped-sunlight falls upon Angela and she explodes. With Angela and her minions dead, Sister Gloria, Melissa, Bibi and Johnny leave the house and return to the school where they are greeted by everyone there. But before the film ends, one student is then seen finding the demonic lipstick which turns into a snake and attacks her.

The first fossils of Gasparinisaura were in 1992 found in Argentina, near Cinco Saltos in R√≠o Negro Province. The type species, Gasparinisaura cincosaltensis, was named and described in 1996 by Rodolfo Coria and Leonardo Salgado. The generic name honors Argentine palaeontologist Zulma Brandoni de Gasparini. The specific name refers to Cinco Saltos.Coria, R. A., and L. Salgado. (1996). \\"A basal iguanodontian (Ornithischia: Ornithopoda) from the Late Cretaceous of South America\\". Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 16: 445‚Äì457  Discovery  The holotype, MUCPv-208, was uncovered in a layer of the Anacleto Formation, dating from the early Campanian, about 83 million years old. It consists of a partial skeleton with skull, lacking much of the vertebral column. The paratype is MUCPv-212, a tail with lower hindlimb elements. In 1997 three additional specimens were described: MUCPv 213, a partial skeleton with skull; MCSPv 111, a postcranial skeleton; and MCSPv 112, a skull with hindlimbs and pelvis. The three later specimens represent juvenile individuals.Salgado, L., Coria, R.A., and Heredia, S., 1997, \\"New materials of Gasparinisaura cincosaltensis (Ornithischia: Ornithopoda) from the Upper Cretaceous of Argentina\\", Journal of Paleontology 71: 933‚Äì940 In 2008 gastroliths present with all three juvenile specimens were described.Ignacio A. Cerda, 2008, \\"Gastroliths in an ornithopod dinosaur\\", Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 53(2): 351-355 Description Artist's impression of Gasparinisaura cincosaltensis Specimen with gastroliths Gasparinisaura was a small bipedal herbivore. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul estimated the length at 1.7 metres, the weight at thirteen kilogrammes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 278 Gasparinisaura had a rounded head that was moderately elongated. The eye sockets were very large and placed in a high position. The rather long back of the head was pendant. The jugal had a front branch that was thin and wedged between the maxilla and the lacrimal; the back of the jugal was high and broad. The quadratojugal had a long ascending process touching the squamosal, a basal trait. The jaw joints were low. There were about twelve, rather large, maxillary or dentary teeth in each upper or lower jaw. The forelimbs were lightly built. The ilium was short and low, the pubis thin. The hindlimbs were relatively long and powerful, with a short thighbone and a long lower leg. The foot was long and the first metatarsal was reduced to a splint, a derived trait. The tail featured low plate-like triangular chevrons that were expanded towards the back, which is unique in the Euornithopoda. The gastroliths discovered formed clusters of up to hundred-forty rounded and polished stones in the abdomen with an average stone diameter of about eight millimetres. Representing about 0.3% of total body weight, they were voluminous enough to function as a gastric mill, a function sometimes denied for sauropod gastroliths because of their insufficient relative mass, being an order of magnitude lower. Classification Originally considered by the describers to have been a basal iguanodont, the most basal member of the clade Euiguanodontia. A phylogenetic analysis included in the description of the Antarctic ornithopod Morrosaurus shows that the latter and Gasparinisaura are part of Elasmaria, a clade of iguanodonts known from South America, Antarctica and maybe Australia. Gasparinisaura would be the basalmost member of this group.Sebasti√°n Rozadilla, Federico L. Agnolin, Fernando E. Novas, Alexis M. Aranciaga Rolando, Mat√≠as J. Motta, Juan M. Lirio & Marcelo P.

Winkler gained national attention because of public speculation regarding her motives and mental health, allegations of abuse by her husband, her brief flight from the state, and again for the brief length (150 days in jail plus 60 days in a mental health facility) of her sentence. In August 2008, Winkler was granted full custody of her three daughters. Criminal case Former Winkler residence in Selmer, Tennessee According to police, Mary Winkler confessed to the March 22, 2006 fatal shooting of her husband, whose body was discovered in their home by church members after he missed that evening's service. He had been shot in the back with a 12-gauge shotgun. The couple had been married since 1996. One neighborhood family reported that Matthew Winkler had repeatedly threatened to shoot that family's dog after it strayed onto the Winklers' lawn. Also, other people as well as Mary Winkler's family alleged that Matthew Winkler had been abusive to Mary. Winkler maintained this was the reason for the shooting. After police issued an Amber Alert due to fears of kidnapping, Mary Winkler and the children (Patricia, then 8; Mary Alice, then 6; Breanna, then 1) were discovered in Orange Beach, Alabama. Winkler was placed into custody there and later extradited to Tennessee to stand trial. When asked by investigators about what had happened to her husband, Winkler stated that she and her husband had argued about money and offered \\"I guess that's when my ugly came out.\\" A grand jury indicted Winkler on June 12, 2006, accusing her of first- degree murder. Bond hearing On June 30, 2006, Mary Winkler's bond hearing was held. A Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agent read a statement Winkler gave to authorities in Alabama, where she was arrested a day after her husband's body was found; in it, Winkler says she did not remember getting the gun but she did know her husband kept a shotgun in their home. The next thing she heard was a loud boom. Matthew Winkler was shot in the back as he lay in bed. He rolled from the bed onto the floor, and, still alive, he asked his wife, \\"Why?\\" to which she responded, \\"I'm sorry.\\" When she left the home, Matthew Winkler was still alive in the bedroom, and the phone had been disconnected from its socket. According to the statement, she and her husband had been arguing throughout the evening about many things, including family finances. She admitted some of the problems were \\"her fault.\\" Mary had lost money in what her lawyer said was a scam. She had deposited checks that came from \\"unidentified sources\\" in Canada and Nigeria into bank accounts belonging to her and her husband. The checks amounted to more than $17,000. Winkler had become caught up in a swindle known as the \\"Nigerian scam\\", which promises riches to victims who send money to cover the processing expenses. She added \\"He had really been on me lately criticizing me for things ‚Äî the way I walk, I eat, everything. It was just building up to a point. I was tired of it. I guess I got to a point and snapped.\\" Bond was later set at $750,000, an amount that defense lawyer Steve Farese Sr. claimed was excessive and \\"tantamount to no bond at all\\". A plea for reduction of bond was filed and subsequently denied. Winkler's lawyers, Leslie Ballin and Steve Farese Sr., also filed motions to throw out her confession on a technicality, to require prosecutors to state whether or not they would seek the death penalty (they did not), to give potential jurors an extensive questionnaire, and other motions relating to voir dire. Winkler's entire defense team (her attorneys Steve Farese Sr., Leslie Ballin, Tony Farese, Steve Farese, Jr. and Investigator Terry Cox) represented her pro bono throughout the criminal case. Release from jail on bond Winkler made bond on August 12, 2006 and was set for release from jail. Initially, problems stemming from a 1999 suspension of the bail bond company kept her in jail. However, Winkler was able to post $750,000 bond and was released on August 15, on the stipulation that she live with Rudolf and Kathy Thomsen, friends in McMinnville, Tennessee. The trial commenced on April 9, 2007, with the prosecution resting on April 16. The defense rested two days later. Trial On April 18, 2007, Mary Winkler took the stand in her own defense. She told a jury of ten women and two men that her husband often \\"berated\\" her and forced her to wear \\"slutty\\" costumes for sex. As proof she displayed a pair of high-heeled shoes and a wig at which those in attendance gasped. Winkler claimed that she only shot her husband accidentally. She said that she went to the bedroom closet and retrieved a shotgun because she wanted to force him to work through their problems. \\"I just wanted him to stop being so mean,\\" she said through tears. Winkler denied she ever actually pulled the trigger, but told the jury \\"something went off\\". She heard a boom, then ran from the house because she thought he would be mad at her. Verdict On April 19, 2007, the jury came back with the verdict: guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Prosecutors had asked that Winkler be convicted of first-degree murder, but the jury settled on the lesser charge after deliberating for eight hours. Sentencing The sentencing phase was set to begin on May 18, 2007, but was delayed due to a scheduling conflict by one of the attorneys. On June 8, 2007, a Tennessee judge sentenced Mary Winkler to 210 days in prison for the conviction of voluntary manslaughter. She had credit for already serving five months and the judge permitted her to spend up to 60 days in an undisclosed mental health facility in Tennessee. She was to be put on probation for the rest of her sentence. Reaction Some men's rights activists argue the sentence did not constitute justice for the killing of Matthew Winkler. They argued that society sees males only as victimizers and say that the definition of emotional abuse has been expanded to include mere criticism, thereby giving anyone who does not like being criticized justification to commit murder in order to end the criticism. Mary Winkler's family alleges that she was reacting to a combination of emotional, sexual, and physical spousal abuse. In a 2007 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Winkler stated that her jail time was too short. \\"There's no amount of time I think you can put on something like this. I was just ready for them to lock the door and throw away the key\\", she told Winfrey. In modern popular culture The song \\"The Wig He Made Her Wear\\" from Southern alt-rock band Drive-By Truckers' 2010 album The Big To-Do describes the case and the details surrounding the actions of the Winklers, particularly that of Mary. The transcript of Mary's police interview was used by Norwegian artist Ignas Krunglevicius in a piece called \\"Interrogation\\" in 2009, in which he changed her last name to show some respect for her privacy.http://www.biennaleofsydney.com.au/19bos/artists/krunglevicius/ Mary Winkler's murder trial was the subject of the 2011 TV film The Pastor's Wife starring Rose McGowan. In April 2020, this case was in a new episode \\"The Pastor's Secrets\\" in the \\"Sex and Murder\\" series on HLN cable network.

Storylines Lorraine first arrives in Albert Square in April 1996 when she comes in search of her son, Joe (Paul Nicholls), who had run away from their home in Bolton with the hope of reuniting with his estranged father, David Wicks (Michael French). Lorraine's marriage to David had been a disaster, ruined by David's numerous infidelities. He had abandoned his wife and two children (Karen and Joe) almost eight years prior to Joe's re-appearance, and he had subsequently played no part in any of their lives. David isn't exactly thrilled to see his son, whose overt display of emotion leaves him feeling decidedly uncomfortable. Lorraine is even less happy to be reunited with her ex-husband. She and Joe had been through a turbulent time since his departure. Her daughter Karen had been killed in a car accident and Joe blames himself for her death because he had swapped seats with her moments before the fatal crash. Upon hearing of Karen's death, David becomes wracked with guilt about abandoning his children, but it still doesn't evoke any parental feelings in him towards his son, and he is relieved when Lorraine manages to persuade Joe to return to Bolton. Joe, however, is not easily put off, and he returns to Walford in May, determined to rebuild a relationship with his father; in order to keep him happy Lorraine moves there with him. Lorraine gets a job as a barmaid in The Queen Victoria public house, and it isn't long before she catches the eye of both Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) and his friend Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley). Nigel pursues Lorraine, but although she likes him, she is never interested in anything more than friendship. Grant is different, and the two start a relationship, which results in him throwing his wife Tiffany (Martine McCutcheon) out when she is six months pregnant with his child. Grant is infatuated with Lorraine and even proposes to her, but Lorraine is forced to put their relationship on the back-burner after her son Joe has a mental breakdown. Joe's behaviour towards his mother becomes extremely hostile and he also starts to develop severe paranoia; even thinking that Grant is the devil and is attempting to poison him. Grant, never the diplomat, decides to counter Joe's accusation by literally trying to shake some sense into him. However, his outburst is witnessed by Lorraine, who promptly ends their relationship. Joe's mental status only worsens after his father runs out on him for a second time. Lorraine becomes desperate, but her attempts at getting Joe professional help do nothing to help matters. Joe eventually becomes so fearful of the outside world that he refuses to leave his flat and this culminates in him holding Lorraine hostage one night, dowsing himself in petrol and threatening to kill himself or anyone that comes near him. Grant manages to rescue Lorraine, but Joe is sectioned as a result and later diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia. Joe is later released, and with his condition stabilised he begins to live a normal life. He makes a trip to Bolton and is instrumental in reuniting Lorraine with her ex-boyfriend Peter. Peter had been driving the car at the time of the crash that killed Lorraine's daughter and this had led to their eventual breakup. Upon reconciling with Peter, Lorraine decides to go back to Bolton in November 1997. Creation and development Introduced in April 1996, Lorraine is the former wife of the already established character David Wicks (Michael French). She is brought into the serial along with her son Joe Wicks (Paul Nicholls). Author Kate Lock has described Lorraine as \\"relentlessly sensible, fair and nice\\" but with a \\"rogue gene\\" that prompted her to select the wrong kind of men. As well as a high-profile storyline concentrating on Joe's diagnosis of schizophrenia, Lorraine's most prominent storyline is a love triange between herself, Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) and Grant's wife Tiffany (Martine McCutcheon). In the storyline, Lorraine discovers that Tiffany is keeping a secret from Grant - that he is potentially not the father of her unborn child. When Tiffany refuses to tell Grant the truth, Lorraine does, making way for them to become a legitimate couple, albeit briefly. Leonard commented in December 1996, \\"Lorraine has had a year on her own and she feels that she probably needs a bit of contact - and Grant's quite macho. It was very interesting from my point of view because Lorraine could be perceived as being bitchy and she's not. She genuinely cares about Tiffany and their marriage and the baby and she wants the whole situation sorted out. But she and Grant do like each other and care about each other and it loses control a bit.\\" Lock has questioned why Lorraine would have fallen for Grant, suggesting that \\"Perhaps she thought she could change him\\". Ultimately though the differences between the couple took their toll. As Lock surmises, \\"[Grant] did really make an effort to be restrained, but maintaining this facade was beyond him and, after seeing Grant shake her son so hard that his teeth rattled, Lorraine called the whole thing off.\\" Leonard decided to leave EastEnders in 1997 to nurse her mother through poor health. She has since commented, \\"my mum was very poorly at the time and I had that to contend with. After a year and a half in the Square, I just thought it was time for me to go. Paul Nicholls, who played Joe, was leaving and it was the natural progression if you like. The schizophrenia storyline was dragging on and there was nowhere else to go with the character. I could have stayed and took the money I suppose, but I just needed the change. I'm glad I took time out.\\" In the serial Lorraine returns to her home town of Bolton with her son Joe and her former partner Peter, making her on-screen exit in November 1997. When discussing the role in 2000, Leonard said, \\"They didn't kill us off and the part was left open, but sadly it's too late to go back now. Besides, none of the characters that could link Lorraine back to Albert Square are there any more. I had to go, though. It was a difficult decision but I felt I'd done all I could with the role.\\" However, she did not rule out the possibility of returning, saying, \\"I think it would be difficult but yes, if the opportunity arose then I would love to go back for a little while. Not forever, just a little while to say hello.\\" Reception Leonard says that viewers of the soap warmed to the character as she was depicted as a \\"caring mum\\". She claims she received a lot of fan mail from fans, mostly children, who wanted their mum to be like Lorraine.

TVNZ 2 is New Zealand's second-oldest television channel, formed in 1975 following the break-up of the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation into Radio New Zealand, Television One and Television Two. It began broadcasting on 30 June 1975, and for most of the 1970s was known as South Pacific Television. In 1980, it became a part of TVNZ when South Pacific Television and Television One merged, and reverted to the name TV2. The channel was renamed TVNZ 2 in October 2016. The channel is broadcast on the government owned Kordia terrestrial network as well as on one of the two Kordia satellite transponders, which is included in channel packages on the Freeview, Igloo, and Sky platforms. Sky also make the channel available on one of their own satellite transponders. History A former logo, used until October 2016. TV2 was formed following the dissolution of the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation on 1 April 1975, with the corporation splitting into Radio New Zealand and two television channels: Television One and Television Two. Whereas TV One took over WNTV1 in Wellington and DNTV2 in Dunedin as well as the existing channel frequencies, TV2 took over AKTV2 in Auckland and CHTV3 in Christchurch and was given new channel frequencies on ITU band III ‚Äì channel 4 in Auckland and channel 8 in Christchurch. TV2 began broadcasting in Auckland and Christchurch on 30 June 1975, but did not begin broadcasting in Wellington (on channel 5) until November and in Dunedin (on channel 4) until well into 1976. The station opened with a Telethon for the St John Ambulance Service. As there was only one national link at the time, and TV One had priority, TV2 used the link overnight to feed the next day's programmes between Auckland and Christchurch so they could be broadcast simultaneously. During its first year, TV2 introduced the Goodnight Kiwi cartoon for its closedown, although it was not until 1980 that it assumed its most recognised form. In 1976, TV2 was renamed South Pacific Television, and along with TV One and Radio New Zealand it became part of the Broadcasting Corporation of New Zealand (BCNZ) in 1977. In 1980, South Pacific Television (which reverted to its original name of TV2) and TV One merged to form Television New Zealand, with the promise of 'complementary programming'. In 1981, tenders were called for the supply of programmes for TV2's morning slot. The following year Northern Television began producing programmes as the first private enterprise TV broadcaster in the country. In 1983 Northern TV was forced to close due to high costs and low advertising revenue. The National government debated selling off TV2 to a private enterprise in 1983, but this did not happen. In 1988 the Labour government dissolved BCNZ, and deregulated the broadcasting market. With the launch of TV3 in 1989, TV2 (now rebranded 'Channel 2') moved away from complementary programming and repositioned itself as an entertainment channel, leaving more serious programming to TV One. In January 1992, Channel 2 introduced 24-hour television overnight which lasted three months. It went back to a nightly closedown but 24-hour programming was reintroduced by mid-1993, initially on Fridays and Saturdays. By mid-1994, 24-hour programming on Channel 2 was extended to Thursdays to Sundays, and on 19 October 1994, Channel 2 began broadcasting non-stop, 24 hours a day. In 1995, Channel 2 reverted to its old name, TV2. TV2's highest-ever rating broadcast was the BBC Panorama interview with Diana, Princess of Wales, which screened on 21 November 1995. 1.517 million New Zealanders tuned in, or 41 percent of New Zealand's population (3.706 million). The broadcast remained the country's most watched television broadcast until 31 August 1997, when TV One's breaking news of Diana's death gained 1.703 million viewers. On 22 September 2007, TV2 went into 16:9 widescreen on Freeview 24 hours a day. On 2 September 2010, TV2 changed from broadcasting in 720p high definition to 1080i. On New Year's Day 2012, TV2 introduced a new look graphics package with a new theme song for the network. At the same time, the TV2 digital on-screen graphic logo moved from the top right hand corner of the screen to the bottom right hand corner of the screen, for the first time since 2003. From 19 August 2013, TV2 reacquired broadcast rights for Home and Away, after outbidding TV3. On 1 October 2016, the channel was renamed TVNZ 2. TVNZ 2+1 A former logo, used until October 2016. TVNZ 2+1 was launched to Freeview and Sky customers on 1 September 2013 as TV2+1. It is a channel with a one-hour time shift of the Auckland TVNZ 2 feed. The channel is available on Channel 7 on Freeview and 502 on Sky. This channel replaced U, which was an interactive youth-orientated channel. When the channel was launched, TV One Plus 1 (now TVNZ 1+1) moved to Channel 6 on Freeview, while TV2+1 took over Channel 7. It was rebranded as TVNZ 2+1 on 1 October 2016.  Home Learning TV  Home Learning TV was launched on 15 April 2020, and broadcast on the channel from 9am to 3pm on weekdays instead of a timeshift of TVNZ 2. From 12 June, it was shifted to TVNZ 2, broadcasting from 8:15am to 9am on weekdays. It was part of the government's efforts to encourage continued educational engagement during the nationwide lockdown that had closed all New Zealand schools. The content was hosted by various New Zealand educators.

The album follows his successful 1990 soundtrack Blaze of Glory, from the film Young Guns II. The production is quite different from the classic rock norm that is a staple of past Bon Jovi albums, with drum loops, female backing vocals and Jon Bon Jovi himself singing in a lower register in most of the tracks. Only one of his longtime bandmates, David Bryan, contributed to the album, though Desmond Child, co-writer of hits such as \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\", plays the tuba in the song \\"Ugly\\" and is also one of the producers.http://music.msn.com/music/artist-albums/jon-bon-jovi/ Retrieved on 2009-02-05 Reception Commercial The album charted at #31 on The Billboard 200, #6 on the Top Canadian albums chart and #2 on the UK Albums Chart. The first single \\"Midnight in Chelsea\\" was Bon Jovi's highest-charting solo single in the UK, reaching #4 on the UK Singles Chart. Also charting in the UK was the second single \\"Queen of New Orleans\\" at #10 and the third single \\"Janie, Don't Take Your Love to Town\\" at #13. The fourth single \\"Ugly\\" charted in some European countries but not in the UK. \\"Staring at Your Window with a Suitcase in My Hand\\" was released as a promo single. Critical Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine described it as \\"a fine example of late-'90s mainstream pop\\" and \\"a breakthrough for Bon Jovi, because it is the first time he sounds like he's come to terms with adulthood.\\" Nevertheless, he criticized the presence of fillers on the record.

It was directed by Robert Altman and starred Keith Carradine and Shelley Duvall. The film was based on the novel of the same name by Edward Anderson, which also supplied source material for the 1948 film They Live by Night, directed by Nicholas Ray. However, the Altman film sticks much closer to the book. The supporting cast includes Louise Fletcher and Tom Skerritt. The film was entered into the 1974 Cannes Film Festival. Plot summary Bowie, a young man convicted of murder when a teenager, and Chicamaw, an old lag, escape from a Mississippi prison in 1936 and join up with another old lag, T-Dub, who has hired a cab to meet them. They hide out with an acquaintance, who owns a garage, and immediately set to work robbing banks. Here Bowie gets to talk to Keechie, the garageman's daughter. They next hole up with T-Dub's sister-in-law Mattie and her children, including her older daughter Lula, the object of T-Dub's lascivious attention. Bowie is injured in a car crash, after which Chicamaw guns down an inquisitive officer. He leaves Bowie at the garage, where Keechie takes care of him. They become lovers but Bowie has no intention of turning his back on crime. Bowie leaves to meet up with the others and they rob a bank, but the trigger-happy Chicamaw shoots and kills a bank clerk. The robbers split up and Bowie returns to a distraught Keechie. We learn that T-Dub has been killed and Chicamaw recaptured and returned to prison. After persuading an unwilling Mattie to let the pregnant Keechie stay in a cabin at her motel, Bowie, posing as a sheriff, springs Chickamaw from prison but the latter, while claiming to have merely tied the warden to a tree, has instead shot him dead. Bowie forces Chicamaw out of the car and leaves him at the side of the road to fend for himself. Returning to the motel cabin he is ambushed by Rangers, who blast the cabin with gunfire, watched by an anguished Keechie, forcibly restrained by Mattie, who has betrayed Bowie. Bowie's bloody body is carried out and laid on the mud. In the final scene we see Keechie at the station, ready to take the first train out to find a place where she can have her baby. (In Anderson's novel, she too is killed by the Rangers.) Cast * Keith Carradine as Bowie * Shelley Duvall as Keechie * John Schuck as Chicamaw * Bert Remsen as T-Dub * Louise Fletcher as Mattie * Tom Skerritt as Dee Mobley Production notes This film has no traditional score. All music in the film is diegetic music or \\"source music,\\" usually presented as coming from a radio. The film features a large number of small-town people as extras. Thieves Like Us was largely filmed on location in Mississippi. Reception Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, writing that it 'no doubt has all sorts of weaknesses in character and plot, but which manages a visual strategy so perfectly controlled that we get an uncanny feel for this time and this place'. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune awarded two-and-a-half stars out of four, saying that the film 'at least on the story level, breaks no new ground' in that the criminals' actions 'are reminiscent of Bonnie and Clyde and a host of lesser films', adding 'Indeed, the major element of surprise in Thieves Like Us is that Altman doesn't surprise us at all.'Siskel, Gene (May 28, 1974). \\"Thieves Like Us\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 4. Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film 'such an engaging, sharply-observed account of a long-lost time, and of some of the people who briefly inhabited it, that I hope it doesn't get confused with other films that seem, superficially anyway, to have covered the same territory'. Variety wrote, \\"Thieves Like Us proves that when Robert Altman has a solid story and script, he can make an exceptional film, one mostly devoid of clutter, auterist mannerism, and other current cinema chic.\\" Pauline Kael of The New Yorker wrote that the film 'seems to achieve beauty without artifice. It's the closest to flawless of Altman's films‚Äîa masterpiece.' Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, 'Demanding and subtle, a seductive reverie of a film, Thieves Like Us affirms Robert Altman's place in the front ranks of American directors.'Thomas, Kevin (April 4, 1974). \\"Losers on the Loose in 'Thieves'\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1, 21. In a negative review for The Washington Post, Gary Arnold called the film 'disappointing', writing that 'the beautiful images seem to freeze or petrify on the screen, because Altman does not bring any intensity to the narrative'.

The bridge links Detroit Avenue on Cleveland's west side and Superior Avenue on Cleveland's east side, terminating west of Public Square. Construction by the King Bridge Company began in 1914 and completed in 1918, at a cost of $5.4 million. It was the first fixed high level bridge in Cleveland, and the third high-level bridge above the Cuyahoga (the first was the Old Superior Viaduct and the second the Central Viaduct, also built by the King Company). At the time of its completion, the bridge was the largest steel and concrete reinforced bridge in the world. Specifications The Detroit‚ÄìSuperior Bridge in August 2015 The high level bridge starts on the east at the center line of West 9th Street and Superior, and extends across the Cuyahoga Valley to the junction of West 25th Street and Detroit Avenue. It is long. The total cost, including the land and a right of way, was $5,407,000, split as $1,687,200 was for land and $3,719,800 for the superstructure.Bridges of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County, 1918; THE NEW DETROIT-SUPERIOR HIGH LEVEL BRIDGE; Stanley L.

The original construction included a main deck wide, with two sidewalks and a roadway. While the bridge's upper level is for road traffic, the lower level was intended for streetcars. It was built with four sets of these tracks, leaving room for two more, if needed. The structure includes 12 concrete arches and one steel span. The steel span is long and crosses the Cuyahoga River. The steel span cost $646,747. About of concrete and of reinforcing steel were used in the construction of the arches. The concrete piles used in the foundation work, if placed end to end, would extend a distance of . Each end of the structure has underground streetcar stations for the trams that operated on the lower deck. Modifications Due to the closure of the streetcar operations, the subway level became unused. In November 1955, ramps to the lower level were closed. The Detroit‚ÄìSuperior Bridge remained a bottleneck during rush hour. A two-year renovation completed in May 1969 added two traffic lanes by narrowing existing sidewalks from 15 to 5 feet and cantilevering the new lanes outside the central arch. On November 11, 1989 (Veterans Day), the bridge was renamed the Veterans Memorial Bridge. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 18, 1974. In 2003, Cuyahoga County Commissioners approved the conversion of the two outside traffic lanes for pedestrian and bicycle use.

While not taxable in the country of incorporation, an IBC or its owners, if resident in a country having \\"controlled foreign corporation\\" rules for instance can be taxable in other jurisdictions. Features Characteristics of an IBC vary by jurisdiction, but will usually include: Chart of an offshore company structure * exemption from local corporate taxation and stamp duty, provided that the company engages in no local business (annual agent's fees and company registration taxes are still payable, which are normally a few hundred U.S. dollars per year) * preservation of confidentiality of the beneficial owner of the company * wide corporate powers to engage in different businesses and activities * abrogation or restriction of the requirement to demonstrate corporate benefit * the ability to issue shares in either registered or bearer form (although many countries have restricted or eliminated bearer shares now) * an abrogation of any requirements to appoint local directors or officers * provision for a local registered agent or registered office All of the above characteristics are also attributable to many \\"onshore\\" countries which have either a residency or territorial based tax system where setting up a company, LLC or LLP in the jurisdiction along with the use of \\"nominees\\" will offer all of the above characteristics. US LLCs, UK LLPs and Hong Kong companies are all examples which are widely used in similar capacity to IBCs and which meet all of the characteristics above. However, under pressure from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), most offshore jurisdictions have removed or are removing the \\"ring fencing\\" of IBCs from local taxation. In most of the jurisdictions, this has been accompanied by reductions of levels of corporate tax to zero to avoid damaging the offshore finance industry. In contrast, Seychelles residents are legally able to own and operate a Seychelles IBC as long as the IBC is not conducting business within Seychelles. Seychelles also has a \\"territorial\\" tax system meaning that Seychelles residents are only taxed on their locally sourced income. Therefore, there is no advantage to non-residents over residents and claims of \\"ring fencing\\" have no merit on the Seychelles IBC. This has been, and continues to be, used successfully by Seychelles in defense of the Seychelles IBC vs. international bodies such as the OECD and FATF. Boosting the defense even more is that there are no restrictions on a Seychelles IBC owning shares of a Seychelles domestic company. Further, most jurisdictions have either eliminated or highly restricted the issuing of bearer shares by IBCs due to international pressures. The IBC legal entry An IBC is a legal entity incorporated under specific legislation which is usually free from all local taxation (except small fixed annual fees). However, in recent years countries such as Belize have changed their corporate laws in order to adhere to global transparency initiatives such as the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and the United States version FATCA. Typically an IBC is limited in its activities it may conduct in and must conduct transactions and business activities outside the boundaries of the country. Though this is generally the rule of thumb, the last decade has seen many changes in corporate laws around the world; as a result, offshore companies and structures in Belize, for instance, are losing their 'offshore' status and are being restructured into the local economy. Anguilla, Bahamas, Belize, Dominica, Nevis, St Vincent and Seychelles have special IBC legislation in place. The British Virgin Islands and Gibraltar formerly had popular IBC regimes, but in each case the relevant legislation has been repealed.For BVI, see BVI Business Companies Act Typical IBC Uses IBCs are offshore companies that are most commonly used for international business such as trade and non-local services, offshore banking, investment, as a special purpose entity, as well as for asset protection. Offshore companies can be used for virtually any type of transactional activity (some requiring a special license) such as buying and selling goods and services, or holding of physical or digital assets, intellectual property, real estate or for banking and investment accounts. Both terms Offshore company and an International Business Company (IBC) refer broadly to the same type of corporate structure and are often used interchangeably. They can be distinguished from traditional domestic companies in a number of ways such as business structure, tax obligations, reporting requirements etc. Each country defines and limits the scope of such companies through corporate laws. Most corporate laws in jurisdictions omit the word 'offshore' due to its negative connotations and non-specific character instead using IBC in reference to companies that engage in non-local activities outside the boundaries of the state. The term 'offshore' is used to refer to a company, or bank account, established outside the jurisdiction of residence or place of doing business.

The bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was located on Lower Bartonsville Road, a paved road a short distance north from Vermont Route 103. Nearby, to the east, is the Worrall Covered Bridge, also built by Granger. In the 1960s, a Town of Rockingham gravel truck fell through the bridge cutting off cars from Lower Bartonsville Village from the direct link to Vermont Route 103 until the floor was replaced. In the early 1980s extensive renovations were conducted on the bridge, including replacing the abutment on the north side of the bridge, reinforcing the original stone abutments on the south side of the bridge, and replacing the roof and the weathered siding. Destruction by Hurricane Irene and replacement On August 28, 2011, the bridge was destroyed by flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall from Hurricane Irene's landfall on the U.S. East Coast.Flooding takes toll on historic bridges , WCAX.com An effort to rebuild the structureBartonsville woman who caught bridge‚Äôs destruction, now helps to rebuild it, Rutland Herald was supported by town officials, who voted to use the bridge's insurance money to build another covered bridge.

This condition can occur for a number of reasons, the simplest of which is when the system has a lower number of actuators than degrees of freedom. In this case, the system is said to be trivially underactuated. The class of underactuated mechanical systems is very rich and includes such diverse members as automobiles, airplanes, and even animals. Definition To understand the mathematical conditions which lead to underactuation, one must examine the dynamics that govern the systems in question. Newton's laws of motion dictate that the dynamics of mechanical systems are inherently second order. In general, these dynamics can be described by a second order differential equation: \\\\ddot{q} = f(q,\\\\dot{q},u,t) Where: q \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n is the position state vector u \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^m is the vector of control inputs t is time. Furthermore, in many cases the dynamics for these systems can be rewritten to be affine in the control inputs: \\\\ddot{q} = f_1(q,\\\\dot{q},t) + f_2(q, \\\\dot{q}, t)u When expressed in this form, the system is said to be underactuated if: rank[{f_2(q, \\\\dot{q}, t)}] < dim[q] When this condition is met, there are acceleration directions that can not be produced no matter what the control vector is. Note that f_2(q, \\\\dot{q}, t) does not explicitly represent the number of actuators present in the system. Indeed, there may be more actuators than degrees of freedom and the system may still be underactuated. Also worth noting is the dependence of f_2(q, \\\\dot{q}, t) on the state q, \\\\dot{q}. That is, there may exist states in which an otherwise fully actuated system becomes underactuated. Examples The classic inverted pendulum is an example of a trivially underactuated system: it has two degrees of freedom (one for its support's motion in the horizontal plane, and one for the angular motion of the pendulum), but only one of them (the cart position) is actuated, and the other is only indirectly controlled. Although naturally extremely unstable, this underactuated system is still controllable. A standard automobile is underactuated due to the nonholonomic constraints imposed by the wheels. That is, a car cannot accelerate in a direction perpendicular to the direction the wheels are facing. A similar argument can be made for boats, planes and most other vehicles.

There are three communities that contribute students: Buffalo, Minnesota, Hanover, Minnesota, and Montrose, Minnesota, which has helped BHS grow into a large school of 2,137 students (Senior Class: 535) (Junior Class: 528) (Sophomore Class: 531) (Freshmen Class: 543) in the 2020-21 school year, with a staff of approximately 400. History Like many other high schools in the area, Buffalo High School (BHS) has moved from building to building as enrollment figures have grown. Education in the Buffalo area started in what is now the local theater. As time went on, what is now the Discovery Elementary School became the high school. Enrollment again rose in the 1970s, and the school was moved to a new building off Highway 25. Suburbanization eventually impacted Buffalo, and in 1994 a referendum for a new school east of town was approved. It was not until 1997 that the new building opened. With the opening, the previous high school building became the Buffalo Community Middle School (BCMS). The former middle school building became Discovery Elementary, which also now houses the District 877 administration offices. 2005‚Äì06 * The long-awaited Bison Activity Center is finished in February after nearly two years of construction. * After completing the season with a 22-2 record, the Buffalo Mock Trial team finishes second at the state competition in Rochester, Minnesota. * Buffalo's Knowledge Bowl team takes third at the state competition in Brainerd, Minnesota. * One Act Play receives a star performance at the state competition for \\"The Elephant Man\\" * Lee Kjesbo (BHS Band Director) is honored as a Minnesota Music Educator of the Year by the Minnesota Music Educators Association. 2006‚Äì07 * The Bison Boys Basketball team won the school's first ever state athletic team title, beating Robbinsdale Armstrong in the Class 4A final at Target Center. * The Buffalo Mock Trial team returned to state and claimed the state title, defeating White Bear Lake in the championship round.

School day BHS offers many courses for students to choose from. 150 total classes are offered, 5 of which are AP classes. The school day begins at 8:50 and ends at 3:25, using a block schedule of four class periods. School building Construction for the current building began in 1995 and finished in the winter of 1997. BHS was the newest high school in the county until Monticello High School was built and finished in 1999, and STMA completed their new high school in 2009. A 2014 bond issue elected to build a 3,500 seat capacity football field, a track, and three practice fields. The work was completed prior to the 2016-17 school year. The bond issue also passed an expansion to the Performing Arts Center, multiple new classrooms, and a new gymnasium. The 1,000 seat Performing Arts Center is used for a wide range of high school and community performances. Bison Activity Center Finished in the beginning of 2006, the field house is the largest of its kind in Minnesota, offering an indoor track (7.3 laps = 1 mile), 36 basketball hoops, 8 retractable curtain walls, retractable baseball pitching nets, batting cages, and 6 retractable tennis nets. State Ranking Currently the Buffalo High School building stands as the 3rd largest school building in the state by area, after Wayzata High School in Plymouth, Minnesota and St. Michael-Albertville High School in Albertville, Minnesota. Arts Magnet For the 2005-2006 school year, Buffalo High School opened a school within a school with their \\"Arts Magnet\\" program. The program is designed to harbor artistically-inclined students with a unique program which plays to their strengths in visual, performance, and literary, media, and applied arts. Students take arts-infused science and English classes as a part of their core curriculum as well as performing in showcases in their freshman and senior years. During the popular senior showcase, students present a culmination of their arts experience in a capstone project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Ny2-AYcU4 Music Program The Buffalo High School music program has many different classes including band and choir that offer three different levels of participation (Freshman, Varsity, and Concert) and also two orchestras: Varsity and Concert Orchestra. Freshman Band and Choir are for freshmen only. Varsity Band and Choir are for all sophomores and those that still want to be in music but are not in the auditioned Concert Band or Choir. The Varsity Orchestra is for all freshmen and those who wish to continue in orchestra but are not in the auditioned Concert Orchestra. Course offerings also include Music in America, Classical Music Listening and AP Music THeory. Along with these, Buffalo High School also offers opportunities to be involved in music outside the classroom. For band they offer Jazz I, II, and III with Jazz III reserved for freshman (though upperclassmen can join if they so choose), Jazz I is for junior and senior auditions only, and Jazz II is for everyone else in between. They also offer membership in symphonic orchestra which is available on a needed basis and is usually given to members of Concert Band. In the summer they offer The Herd http://theherdmarchingband.wordpress.com/about/ Marching Band. This is a non- audition marching band that travels throughout the state of Minnesota during the summer. Every other year this band will take a trip to a destination in the United States or Canada. For those involved in Choir they offer BHS Singers, Treble Singers, Varsity Singers, and Freshman Singers. All the choir ensembles must be auditioned for. In 2010, a new after-school program, Chamber Orchestra, was started for students in Orchestra by director Mike Knutson. This new group is audition only and consists of students from all grades. The Buffalo High School Music program has received numerous awards throughout its existence. In 2011 both the Concert Choir and Concert Band were chosen to perform at the Minnesota Music Educators Association (MMEA) Clinic. It was prestigious for one group to be chosen, but Buffalo High had two groups chosen. In the spring of 2012 the Concert Choir was selected to perform at Orchestra Hall in the Choral Arts Finale and in the fall of 2012 they were selected to perform at the ACDA-MN Fall Conference. Buffalo High School has placed very highly (Excellent or Superior ratings) at solo and ensemble contests for individuals and also in large group contests. Their Marching Band has won parade contests not only in Minnesota but also in other states such as Virginia and Michigan. At Buffalo it is possible to join more than one section of music, such as Band and Choir, or Choir and Orchestra. Student life BHS offers many leadership roles and opportunities for students through their four years including: * Students Stepping Up (S.S.U.) * Student Council * Class Cabinet * National Honor Society (N.H.S.) In addition there are a number of special events. The school offers a range of clubs and extra-curricular activities. Athletics Huge growth in enrollment prompted Buffalo High School to join the Lake Conference, a conference of 7 large suburban high schools west of Minneapolis (Buffalo High School, Eden Prairie High School, Edina High School, Hopkins High School, Minnetonka High School, St. Michael- Albertville High School, and Wayzata High School) and is the 5th largest school in the conference. Prior to joining the Lake Conference in 2019, the Bison competed in the Mississippi 8 Conference and the North Suburban Conference. A full range of sports are offered for both boys and girls.

Shed Style refers to a style of architecture that makes use of single-sloped roofs (commonly called \\"shed roofs\\"). The style originated from the designs of architects Charles Willard Moore and Robert Venturi in the 1960s. Their works were influential to the style that would include the Sea Ranch in California (Moore) and the Vanna Venturi House (Venturi). Shed style architecture became very popular in the 1970s and 1980s, but most shed style homes stopped being built after the mid to late 1980s, though, today, houses use some characteristics from the shed style houses. Characteristics Common stylistic features of shed style include overall asymmetry with strong lines, one- to two-story height, and seamless roof and wall intersection. Shed styles were developed in the early 1970s, however, they quickly died out in the 1980s because of the high maintenance costs they created.

It was adapted into a 10 episode animated series.  Plot  The story stars Tsubaki Sadamitsu, a young delinquent and leader of the Corpse Gang, who has a chance encounter with an alien robot working to capture banished intergalactic criminals who are arriving on Earth named . When he ends up causing the robot's body to be destroyed as a result, Sadamitsu discovers not only can its head operate independently without the body, he can also wear the head as a helmet to gain some of the robot's powers. Ever-chivalrous, Sadamitsu becomes determined to make up for the mess his actions have caused, and accepts using these powers and working with the robot's computer to take up its mission. Though he receives other outside assistance, his job is made harder with the appearance of the Vulture, a last-ditch effort to keep the Ry≈´kei-dai under control. An English adaptation of the anime was released in North America by Media Blasters in 2003. Characters ; : :The hot-headed, fight-enjoying main character. While he loves a good fight, he detests pointless cruelty and never kills, even if his own life is threatened. His preferred weapon is a bokken (wooden sword). In combat, he wears the sentient helmet nicknamed 'Junk' and wields an energy weapon that seals the Ry≈´kei-dai away. ; : :A robotic entity that identifies itself as Pursuer 7706983, Junk's body was destroyed during an encounter with a Ry≈´kei-dai. His severed head called out to Sadamitsu and, once worn as a helmet, empowered the youth enough to stand up to the superhuman strength of the Ry≈´kei-dai. While severely damaged towards the end of the anime, the Vulture's energy transfer revives him and Junk increases Sadamitsu's strength even further, adding new weapons to his arsenal. Sadamitsu refers to him as 'Junk' while other characters refer to him as 'Helmet', 'Helmet-san' (Mr. Helmet) and the like. :Aside from being capable of unassisted flight based on anti-gravity and commandeering nearby electronic equipment, Junk is capable of temporarily bonding with a person who wears his head as a helmet, enveloping the wearer in an impact-resistant material similar in appearance to Junk's original body; after the suit is upgraded, it gains a bulkier exoskeleton and a cape-like armor plate that can be jettisoned. His main weapon is the Activator, a palm-mounted energy pulse emitter that launches \\"inverse gravitational spheres\\" in order to safely Recover Ry≈´kei-dai by compressing their body in an immense gravitational field then launching the target into space, unharmed. After analyzing Sadamitsu's fighting style, Junk uses the Activator's gravity field to compress a lightning rod's boson particles into a metal bokken called a Boson Carried Terminator Outfit; this weapon is capable of initiating a Recovery with a single hit on the target. The destructive power of Junk's Activator can be increased with the sufficient application of energy up to a blast radius of thousands of kilometers, enough to shatter an Earth-sized planet. ; : :A strange girl in Sadamitsu's class, Yayoi has many secrets about her. She also knows something about Sadamitsu's past and appears to be attracted to him, though she weirds him out. She is also a controller of Vulture, a humanoid that appears as an ornamental suit of golden armor but is actually a fully sentient miniature interstellar battleship. It is later revealed that she and Sadamitsu were childhood friends until the Vulture accidentally killed her upon arrival on Earth. Because the Vulture also lost its host body, it revived and possessed Yayoi, erasing Sadamitsu's memories about her. Meanwhile, it kept Yayoi's memories, ultimately resulting in the Vulture proceeding to hunt down the Ry≈´kei-dai rather than simply destroying the entire planet with its military-grade Activator, due to its new host's affection towards Sadamitsu. At first, Yayoi is shown to positively relish slaughtering Ry≈´kei-dai until Sadamitsu's angry protest awoke feelings of regret, escalating to the point where Yayoi attempts to heal a Ry≈´kei-dai she injured earlier and brutally massacres the humans who subject the creature to electric torture. Afterwards, the Vulture only kills Ry≈´kei-dai in self-defense. :Near the end of the anime, it is revealed that Vultures react to emergency requests by using a time dilation field in order to arrive on-site as soon as needed. Yayoi's Vulture appeared ahead of time due to an accident; by analyzing the data surrounding the event, Junk realized that he himself called for the Vulture's assistance in the future in reaction to a Ry≈´kei-dai infecting Yayoi's Vulture and overpowering Sadamitsu. With no alternate way to undo the infection, Yayoi is Recovered along with the Ry≈´kei-dai in order to undo the Vulture's initial arrival on Earth (since there is no reason to request its deployment). As a result, Yayoi is reset into a normal girl who never encountered the Vulture but retains childhood memories of Sadamitsu. ; : :Falsely banished as a criminal, Kulon landed on Earth among the other Ry≈´kei-dai. Being a speedster, stated to being the fastest in the universe, he caused some ruckus while being chased by the police. He was arrested in the first place because he enjoyed giving other beings the same feeling he had with his speed, but unknowingly gave a ride to criminals. Ultimately, he was taken in by Sadamitsu, where he served a role similar to that of a sidekick's, usually being used as a motorcycle. He proves to be very loyal, as he addresses Sadamitsu as and obeys his requests even when he is obviously frightened.

Elton Trueblood\\", was a noted 20th-century American Quaker author and theologian, former chaplain both to Harvard and Stanford universities.  Early life and education  Elton Trueblood was born December 12, 1900 in Iowa, the fourth of five children, and was graduated from William Penn College in Iowa in 1922. He did graduate study at Brown University, Hartford Seminary, and Harvard University before finishing his PhD at Johns Hopkins University in Philosophy.  Career  During his career, Trueblood held faculty and chaplain positions at Haverford College, Guilford College, Harvard University, Stanford University, and Earlham College. He then settled in the Quaker community of Richmond, Indiana intending to help spur the growth of Earlham College from a small regional religious school into a nationally recognized institution of higher learning. He was a founder of the Earlham School of Religion, a Quaker seminary in Richmond, and contributed to a renaissance of American Quaker thought and action spurred on partly by the common experiences of Quaker intellectuals as conscientious objectors during World War II (although Trueblood himself was not a pacifist). He actively sought to mentor younger Quakers into his nineties. Trueblood also founded the Yokefellow movement and supported Stephen Ministries. His Yokefellow funders included some of his past students, such as planned community developer Charles Samuel Coble, whom Trueblood taught and also coached in track in the late 1920s at Guilford College. He was a political conservative who supported Nixon's foreign policy, including the Vietnam War, and gave the invocation at the 1972 Republican National Convention. Nonetheless, he was known for maintaining an internationalist perspective, serving for many years as the permanent representative from the global Quaker community to the World Council of Churches, an organization he helped bring into being. In the 1950s, he served as a senior advisor to President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who created a post for him as Director of Religious Information at the U.S. Information Agency (formerly the Voice of America). Time magazine profiled him in this role on March 15, 1954. During the Nixon Administration he again served as an adviser to the President.  Publications  Elton Trueblood wrote 33 books, including: The Predicament of Modern Man, Alternative to Futility, Foundations for Reconstruction, Signs of Hope, The Logic of Belief, Philosophy of Religion, Robert Barclay, Abraham Lincoln: Theologian of American Anguish, The Idea of a College, The People Called Quakers, The Incendiary Fellowship, The Trustworthiness of Religious Experience (1939 Swarthmore Lecture), A Place to Stand, Your Other Vocation and The Humor of Christ. Trueblood's short book, The Predicament of Modern Man, received much attention near the end of World War II for the way it addressed a widespread interest in finding spiritual meaning and morality in the face of such extreme suffering during World War II. In the book he asserted that searching for morality without a foundation in religion was a futile effort, using the analogy of trying to make cut flowers in a vase live forever. Elton wrote a shorter version of this basic thesis for Reader's Digest, which generated volumes of mail; he reportedly responded to every letter. Some reviewers have considered Trueblood's books, especially The Logic of Belief and Philosophy of Religion, among his most rigorous intellectual contributions to the field of philosophy of religion. Trueblood's book on Abraham Lincoln caught the attention of Nancy Reagan, who talked about it in an interview with Good Housekeeping in September 1981. It was reissued in 2012 by Phoenix Press with the title Abraham Lincoln: A Spiritual Biography . Trueblood told several students and reviewers that he sought to provide the general audience with many readable works to promote a depth of religious thought among his readers. One of his final books was an autobiography titled While it is Day, which traced his personal journey from boyhood in Iowa and placed his personal history in the context of the history of his family's long connection with Quakerism.  Friend of Presidents  Trueblood became a lifetime friend of President Herbert Hoover, who was also a Quaker. They first met when Elton was the chaplain and a faculty member at Stanford University and Hoover had retired to Palo Alto, California. They lived near each other and eventually struck up a friendship that lasted for decades. When Hoover died in 1964 while Trueblood was traveling in southeast Asia, the State Department flew Trueblood back to the United States to perform the funeral service at the request of Hoover's family.Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum Trueblood was also friends with Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.  Family and retirement  He had four children (Martin, Arnold, Sam and Elizabeth) with his first wife, Pauline, who died in 1955. Trueblood was remarried in 1956 to Virginia Zuttermeister in ceremonies held at the Washington National Cathedral. Trueblood retired from Earlham College in 1966, but lived in Richmond, Indiana, for nearly the rest of his life. For many years he also maintained a summer home on Lake Paupac (), a Quaker retreat in the Pocono Mountains near Greentown, PA. He continued to write books and give public speeches in retirement. Trueblood died on December 20, 1994. His obituary was featured in The New York Times. His cremains are interred at his study, Teague Library, on the campus of Earlham College. He is not buried in the Washington National Cathedral.  References   Further reading  *Elton Trueblood. While It Is Day: An Autobiography. Richmond, IN: Yokefellow Press, 1974. Newby, Elizabeth, ed.

History No. 2 Road Bridge During the planning stage, the creation of additional intertidal marsh and riparian woodlands compensated for the project-related impact upon the intertidal basin. Over subsequent decades, the enclosed 3,500-square-metre constructed marsh and adjacent natural marshes, along the southern shoreline, have proven effective in protecting the plant, fish and wildlife habitat. The City of Richmond funded the $39m construction using debt, existing reserves, and a $5m provincial grant. The scheme was the biggest capital project the city had undertaken to that point. The city paid the final loan installment in 2013. The span connects Lulu Island with Sea Island, home to Vancouver International Airport (YVR). At the official opening ceremony in July 1993, Art Charbonneau, the provincial Minister of Transportation and Highways, unveiled a plaque, and Mayor Greg Halsey-Brandt cut the ribbon. After pedestrians walked, jogged or ran the span, cars crossed a few hours later. No doubt, John Miller, principal of JJM Group, the prime contactor, would have been present. A public survey chose the bland name. Although some suggestions at the time, and since, preferred to honour a public figure, any consensus could prove difficult. The city owns and maintains this low-level four-lane bridge, having bicycle lanes and a wide, separated sidewalk. On the north bank, a trail passing beneath the bridge connects the sidewalks. On the south bank, a pedestrian ramp on the west side connects with the dyke trail below. The sequential box-girder, prestress, post-tension structure is long and wide, supported by 10 spans resting on 217 prestressed concrete piles. The relatively low profile provides a seamless flow with connecting roads and avoids interference with seaplane traffic, that usually flies westward, low over the bridge, before landing and taxiing to the Middle Arm terminal. A mayoral rival to Halsey-Brandt had campaigned for a less expensive, two-lane span. From Russ Baker Way, the route provides direct access to No. 2 Rd., and easier access to points further west. Formerly, this traffic would divert southeast across the Dinsmore Bridge, follow a rightward curve along Gilbert Rd., and a leftward curve along Elmbridge Way, before west on Westminster Highway. The new crossing transferred most traffic from the congested Dinsmore. South bank redevelopment At the time of bridge construction, the city seemed unaware of the development potential of its vacant land that stretched to Hollybridge Way. An RV park leased the eastern portion until 2004. Prior to the Richmond Olympic Oval development, River Rd., free of interrupting intersections, was a popular thoroughfare. To offset the oval development costs, the city sold 18.6 acres of riverfront land in early 2007 for $141m. That year, the city realigned this section of River Rd. away from the foreshore. The planned and completed private development high-rises, called River Green, encompass over 27 acres of shoreline property with unobstructed river views. The four-lane River Rd. between Hollybridge Way and Gilbert Rd. will extend to Capstan Way. However, west of the Oval, the two lanes, the sharp turn from No. 2 Rd., and the sharp S-bend leading beneath the bridge, have a temporary appearance. The underside clearance of is the lowest of any in Richmond. Perhaps the city envisages an overpass at No. 2 Rd. taking River Rd. to a junction with Lynas Lane, thereby transforming the existing foreshore road into a green space. No. 2 Road North pump station Richmond, about metre above sea level, requires drainage and flood protection for businesses, agriculture and over 200,000 residents. The city manages of dykes; 39 drainage pump stations with a combined pumping capacity of over one million gallons per minute; and over of ditches and storm sewers. Built in 1974, the previous station, with a capacity, was near the end of its useful life, and needed an upgrade to . The city sought a design that drew attention and engaged the public, with an emphasis on interpretive components, public space and local art. The transparent design of the replacement station, using the existing concrete wet well structure beside the southwestern part of the bridge, allows the public to view the complicated pumping machinery. The Public Works Association of B.C. chose this station for the 2018 Project of the Year award.

It runs in a south-eastern direction into the Ottawa River at Waltham, Quebec. It is named after the dark colour of its water (noire is French for \\"Black\\"). This river is often grouped together with the Dumoine and Coulonge Rivers as three of a kind. All three are in the same area, have similar characteristics, and are popular with whitewater canoers. Geography The Noire River springs from an unnamed location in wilderness just south of La V√©rendrye Wildlife Reserve. It flows through Quebec's portion of the Canadian Shield and is marked by sections of rocky whitewater alternated by meandering sections through sand valleys. Typical trees in this area are Black Spruce, Jack Pine, Eastern White Pine, Red Pine, juniper, alder, and birch. The river is undeveloped except the last , where cottages and even an inn line the river. Just before it flows into the Ottawa River, there is dam with a power generating station on the Noire River. Paddling the Noire River The Noire River is not navigable until the confluence with Coughlin Creek, about from its end. From here, the rapids that can be run are mostly Class 1 or 2 (based on medium water levels). A total of are runnable whitewater. Notable rapids on the Noire are: *km 114, \\"The Wall\\" - technical Class 2. *km 100, \\"Targie\\" - Class 3 to 2. *km 51, \\"50-50\\" - Class 3. *km 40 to 30 - continuous Class 1 and swifts (except in low water) One portage of note is the one around Mountain Chute. One has to take either a long route through arduous terrain or a shorter one that begins at the top of the falls and ends in a steep near-vertical descent requiring ropes. Hydroelectric station and dam The river has been used for hydroelectric power generation since the beginning of the 20th century and is reputedly the first commercial station in Canada. A high capacity gravity concrete dam was built in 1937 and modified in 1994. The dam is high, long, and has a capacity of 13,800 m¬≥ (18,050 yd¬≥). The dam and W.R. Beatty Generating Station are near the mouth of the river at the outlet of Robinson Lake and generate 10.6 MW. Originally owned by the Pembroke Electric Light Company and then the Pontiac Hydro Commission, it was acquired in 1996 by Brookfield Power. none References Category:Rivers of Outaouais Category:Tributaries of the Ottawa River ","title":"Noire River (Ottawa River tributary)"},{"id":"4539159","text":"Hearts of the World Hearts of the World (also known as Love's Struggle) is a 1918 American silent World War I propaganda film written, produced and directed by D. W. Griffith. In an effort to change the American public's neutral stance regarding the war, the British government contacted Griffith due to his stature and reputation for dramatic filmmaking. Hearts of the World stars Lillian and Dorothy Gish and Robert Harron. The film was produced by D.W. Griffith Productions, Famous Players-Lasky Corporation and the War Office Committee was distributed by Paramount Pictures under the Artcraft Pictures Corporation banner. Plot Two families live next to one another in a French village on the eve of World War I. The Boy in one of the families falls for the only daughter in the other family. As they make preparations for marriage, World War I breaks out, and, although the Boy is American, he feels he should fight for the country in which he lives. When the French retreat, the village is shelled. The Boy's father and the Girl's mother and grandfather are killed. The Girl, deranged, wanders aimlessly through the battlefield and comes upon the Boy badly wounded and unconscious. She finds her way back to the village where she is nursed back to health by The Little Disturber who had previously been a rival for the Boy's affections. The Boy is carried off by the Red Cross. Von Strohm, a German officer, lusts after the Girl and attempts to rape her, but she narrowly escapes when he is called away by his commanding officer. Upon his recovery, the Boy, disguised as a German officer, infiltrates the enemy-occupied village, finds the Girl. The two of them are forced to kill a German sergeant who discovers them. Von Strohm finds the dead sergeant and locates the Boy and Girl who are locked in an upper room at the inn. It is a race against time with the Germans trying to break the door down as the French return to retake the village. Cast Production notes Photo of filming Hearts of the World in France. D. W. Griffith is in the photo in civilian clothing. The British Government gave D.W. Griffith unprecedented access to film in locations that were otherwise forbidden to journalists. After being presented to George V and Queen Mary, Griffith was introduced to members of London's aristocracy who agreed to appear in the film. Among them were Lady Lavery, Elizabeth Asquith, Diana Manners. Playwright No√´l Coward also appeared as an extra. Exterior shots were largely filmed throughout England from May to October 1917. Griffith made two trips to France where he filmed footage of the trenches. In one instance Griffith and his film crew were forced to take cover when their location came under German artillery fire; he escaped unscathed. The film company returned to Los Angeles where British and Canadian troops recreated battle scenes and other interior scenes on a stage at Fine Arts Studio in Los Angeles from November to December 1917. The scenes shot in Europe and Los Angeles were edited together with footage from stock newsreels. In a scene cut from the movie, actress Colleen Moore appeared as a little girl in her bed who, hearing the war raging beyond her window, was so frightened that she turned the hands of her alarm clock forward, hoping that time would rush forward to the end of the fighting.Colleen Moore, Silent Star (1968) Reception Lillian Gish, the actress who portrayed 'The Girl', later said:What others said about \\"Hearts of the World\\" (from the 'Silents Are Golden' silent movies website. Retrieved August 16, 2007) :\\"Hearts of the World enjoyed great success until the Armistice when people lost interest in war films. The film inflamed audiences. Its depiction of German brutality bordered on the absurd. Whenever a German came near me, he beat me or kicked me.\\" She also noted that: :\\"I don't believe that Mr. Griffith ever forgave himself for making Hearts of the World. 'War is the villain,' he repeated, 'not any particular people.'\\" lobby card Some historians have also noted that Hearts of the World and similar films encouraged a 'hysterical hatred' of the enemy which complicated the task of the Versailles peacemakers. Like many American films of the time, Hearts of the World was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards. For example, the Chicago Board of Censors required cuts, in Reel 3, of that part of a bayoneting scene showing closeup of a man's side from which a stream of blood flows, Reel 6, that portion of dancing scene where dancer twirls her skirt and exposes posterior to camera, officer carrying young woman off into other room, six scenes of German officer on floor motioning to young woman to come and lie down beside him, closeup of same German officer reaching up with arms for young woman to come to him, closeup of officer and young woman embracing in bunk, officers forcing young peasant women towards bunks, scene showing young women in bunks with clothing disheveled and hair down and officers walking off and adjusting clothes, and the intertitle \\"Dungeons of Lust\\" and scenes of young women lying prostrate following the intertitle. Hearts of the World is referenced in L. M. Montgomery's novel set during World War I, Rilla of Ingleside. Rilla recalls in her diary, \\"The heroine was struggling with a horrible German soldier who was trying to drag her away. I knew she had a knife‚ÄîI had seen her hide it, to have it in readiness‚Äîand I couldn't understand why she didn't produce it and finish the brute. I thought she must have forgotten it, and just at the tensest moment of the scene I lost my head altogether. I just stood right up on my feet in that crowded house and shrieked at the top of my voice‚Äî'The knife is in your stocking‚Äîthe knife is in your stocking!'\\" Status A print of the film still exists and is held by the Cohen Media Group.

It has commanding views of Gardiners Bay and is famed for its decommissioned lighthouse. History Settled in 1651, Cedar Point was once a busy port for shipping farm goods, fish, and timber from Sag Harbor. The historic Cedar Point Lighthouse stood on an island 200 yards from shore when it was built in 1839. Its beacon served to guide whaling ships in and out of Sag Harbor during its hey-day as a major port. The New England Hurricane of 1938 transformed the shoreline, shifting sands to create a narrow, walkable strip that now connects the lighthouse with the mainland. The 40 foot granite lighthouse which was built in 1868 was decommissioned in 1934 and replaced by an automatic light on a steel skeleton at breakwater. See also: The lighthouse, built in the Italianate style, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Virtually the entire park including the lighthouse was owned at one time by Phelan Beale, husband of Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale, whose dissolved marriage was the topic of movie, television and Broadway versions of Grey Gardens. It operated as a hunting club called the Grey Goose Gun Club of Cedar Point.Phelan Beale, 75, Retired Lawyer - New York Times - June 12, 1956 and was acquired by Suffolk County in 1967. The lodge itself is now the park foreman's residence just north of the park's general store. During the 1970s a small bush plane crash landed in the waters near the point. A father and son were killed instantly and their plane hit the water. The bodies were brought back to Coecles Harbor, Shelter Island and most of the plane parts were found and also brought back to Coecles. In 1974 vandals burned the interior of the lighthouse. The Long Island Chapter of the United States Lighthouse Society is currently working to restore the Cedar Island Lighthouse. They are seeking $2 million to convert it to a museum and bed and breakfast. Part of the plan includes restoring the lantern.

Mainfreight commenced operations in Auckland in 1978 and is one of the largest freight companies in New Zealand. Mainfreight listed on the NZX in 1996 History Mainfreight was founded on 6 March 1978 by Bruce Plested who started the company with just $7,200.00 and a 1969 Bedford Truck. In 1979, Bruce Plested partnered with Neil Graham, with Mr Graham taking over the running of the business. When the company was founded it entered a highly regulated transport market. A licence from New Zealand Railways Corporation was needed to carry freight over 150 km. When deregulation of land transport occurred in October 1982, Mainfreight quickly took advantage of the opportunities presented and won a large share of the freight market. Whilst describing the foundation of Mainfreight in 2000, Mr Plested said to the New Zealand Herald, \\"We moved all our freight by sea between Auckland, and Christchurch and Dunedin, and we worked weekend shifts to make sure we loaded and unloaded the ship using the whole of the seven days - we found that was faster and more reliable than our big competitors.\\" Subsidiaries Mainfreight Australia The firm's Australian domestic freight and logistics division, Mainfreight Distribution, began operations in 1989, with an operation in Sydney. This operation was expanded with depots in Melbourne and Brisbane. It now has nine company depots in Australia and relies on agents and third parties in the Northern Territory, Tasmania and regional Australia. Mainfreight International Mainfreight International was Mainfreight's first international sea and airfreight business and was started in 1984 by Bruce Plested's brother Gerald. They established agencies in the early days with Australian, Pacific Island and United States freight forwarders and the established agents in most major trading partner countries of New Zealand. Mainfreight USA Mainfreight has international operations in the USA through its CaroTrans International Inc and most recently Mainfreight International Inc businesses after the 2007 acquisition of Target Logistics, in Asia (nine branches in China, one each in Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong). In 2007, Mainfreight acquired Target Logistics, a U.S. based forwarder with 34 U.S. offices, and an extensive agent network. In 2008, the U.S. locations were re-branded as Mainfreight USA. Acquisitions Halford International On 11 June 2007, Mainfreight 'signed a call option deed' to purchase the entirety of the shares of Australian-based Halford International Pty Ltd. Formerly Halford Young, Halford is a private logistics company and freight forwarder with operations and networks in Australia and New Zealand, Japan, Germany, throughout Asia and the United States of America. Mainfreight will acquire Halford for approximately AUD$21 million. The acquisition will extend Mainfreight's existing Australian operations by 6 branches. Don Braid, Mainfreight's Group Managing Director said, \\"We are impressed by Halford's strong culture and capabilities, and we look forward to welcoming the Halford International team to the Mainfreight family.\\" Owens Group In 2003 Mainfreight bought Owens Group Limited, one of New Zealand's largest trucking firms. This takeover was in response to the purchase of Tranz Rail by Australian transport firm Toll Holdings. With the takeover of the Owens Group in 2003 they purchased Owens International Australia. In 2006 the New Zealand Mainfreight International and Owens International businesses were also merged to make Mainfreight Owens International Ltd (now Mainfreight International).

One of a dozen or so significant tributaries of the Ottawa River, it has a length of and a drainage area of , and runs in a general south-eastern direction from its headwaters in Lac au Barrage (situated in La V√©rendrye Wildlife Reserve) to the Ottawa River at Fort-Coulonge. Over that distance, it drops approximately ‚Äî of that over the massive Grandes or Coulonge Chutes, approximately upstream of the confluence with the Ottawa River. A popular river for whitewater canoeing enthusiasts, it is often grouped together with the Dumoine and Noire Rivers as three of a kind. The three rivers share the same watershed, and have similar whitewater characteristics. All three empty into the Ottawa River within a distance of from one another. The historic F√©lix-Gabriel-Marchand Bridge crosses the Coulonge River near Fort-Coulonge. Constructed in 1898, this long bridge is the longest covered bridge in Quebec. History The Coulonge River is named after Nicholas d'Ailleboust de Manthet (1663-1709), Sieur de Coulonge, a French explorer who spent the winter of 1694-95 at the nearby Allumettes Island. Upper Coulonge River in La V√©rendrye Park The Coulonge was used as a waterway by native North Americans and, later, by the coureurs des bois plying their independent trade in furs. In 1784, the North West Company built a fort at the mouth of the river, named Fort Coulonge, which passed into the hands of the Hudson's Bay Company when the 2 companies merged in 1821. The Grandes Chutes In 1835, Scottish-born lumber baron George Bryson acquired timber rights to thousands of acres of forest in the area, including the immediately surrounding the Grandes Chutes. In 1843, Bryson built a sawmill near the mouth of the river, which led to permanent settlement and the formation of the village of Fort-Coulonge. To transport the squared timber safely past the falls and the gorge below, Bryson built a -long timber slide (a wooden chute flowing with water diverted from the head of the falls), which was replaced by a concrete chute in 1923. For almost 150 years, the forests around the Coulonge were logged throughout the winter months until spring breakup permitted the massive log drives which, along with similar operations throughout the Ottawa River watershed, fueled the economy of the Ottawa Valley region from the early 19th Century through the middle of the 20th. The last spring log drive in Canada took place on the Coulonge River in 1982. Since then, the timber from smaller-scale logging operations has been hauled out by trucks over a network of dirt roads which meander throughout the Coulonge River valley. In 1994, a hydro-electric dam and power station was built at the head of the Grandes Chutes, leaving the Dumoine River as the last major free-flowing tributary of the Ottawa River. In August 2020, 2 persons drowned in the Coulonge River in separate incidents: the body of a woman was found just north of Fort Coulonge; and a man was swept away by strong rapids while swimming about upstream.

Built about 1870, it is the only surviving 19th- century covered bridge in the town, after the Hall Covered Bridge collapsed in 1980 and was replaced in 1982, and the Bartonsville Covered Bridge was washed away by Hurricane Irene in 2011 and replaced in 2012-2013. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The Worrall Covered Bridge is located on Williams Road, a dirt road a short distance north of Vermont Route 103, that generally parallels the Williams River on its north side, while VT 103 follows the river on the south side. The bridge is a Town lattice truss structure, with a total span of and a total structure length of . The trusses rest on stone abutments that have been reinforced with concrete, and the road bed ( wide, or one lane) has been reinforced with laminated beams. It is topped by a gabled metal roof, and is sheathed in vertical board siding, with openings on its south side to improve traffic visibility. The bridge includes one rare feature ‚Äî a wooden ramp leading up to the northwest entrance. The bridge was built in 1870 by Sanford Granger, a local master builder.

At a length of , the route is significantly shorter than when it travelled beyond Hamilton to Niagara Falls. However, the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) replaced the role of Highway 8 between those two cities, and that portion of the highway was subsequently transferred from provincial to local jurisdiction. Today the highway connects Hamilton and Cambridge, thereafter continuing through Southwestern Ontario to the community of Goderich on the shores of Lake Huron. The freeway segment of Highway 8 is known as the Freeport Diversion, King Street Bypass, or Highway 8 Expressway, with a short portion being internally designated by the province as Highway 7187. Highway 8 is multiplexed with Highway 7 including a portion of the Conestoga Parkway.  History   Native trails   Provincial highway  Until 1918, the majority of the primary roads through southern Ontario formed part of the County Road System. The Department of Public Works and Highways paid up to 60% of the construction and maintenance costs for these roads, while the counties were responsible for the remaining 40%. In 1919, the federal government passed the Canada Highways Act, which provided $20,000,000 to provinces under the condition that they establish an official highway network; up to 40% of construction costs would be subsidized. The first network plan was approved on February 26, 1920, and included the Queenston Road. The majority of what would soon become Highway 8 was assumed by the department over the course of the year. However, it would not receive a route number until the summer of 1925. Up until the early 1970s, the highway was much longer than its current length, extending from Goderich through Kitchener-Waterloo, Cambridge, and Hamilton to Niagara Falls. However, in 1970, the Government of Ontario decided that the stretch of Highway 8 between Winona (just east of Hamilton) and Niagara Falls was no longer of major transportation significance, since by this time most traffic used the QEW, just to the north, to go between the two locales. Accordingly, the province downloaded this section of the highway to the newly formed Regional Municipality of Niagara, which designated the road as Regional Road 81. In 1998, the provincial government of Mike Harris carried another downloading of the highway to municipal authorities; this time the section between the town of Peters Corners (near Dundas) and Winona was transferred to the Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth.Ontario Highway 8 History - The King's Highways of Ontario Rockton In 2004, extensive improvements were completed around the former obsolete and bottle-necked \\"half-cloverleaf\\" interchange of the Conestoga Parkway and the Highway 8 Expressway in Kitchener. This included a new flyover semi-directional ramp from Conestoga westbound to Highway 8 eastbound, while the ramp in the opposite direction was realigned to allow it to carry two lanes of traffic at a higher speed. In 2002-2004 the Highway 8 Expressway was widened from four to eight lanes from the interchange to just east of Franklin Street, which necessitated moving one retaining wall and replacing the overpass which carries Franklin Street over the Highway 8 Expressway. From 2006 to 2012, there was the widening of the Highway Expressway to eight lanes past the interchange with Fairway Road (Waterloo Regional Road 53) and over the Grand River as far as the highway's next intersection with King Street about 6 km southward was undertaken. It was completed in 2012. In September 2012, MTO completed the reconstruction of the three-road junction at Peters Corners in northern Hamilton, the eastern terminus of Highway 8, as a roundabout with separate traffic signals for the northern (Westover Road) and southeastern (Hamilton Road 8) arms. The interchange of Highway 8 and Highway 401 is planned to be expanded, with high speed flyover ramps linking Highway 401 west of that interchange directly to the Highway 8 Expressway; at the present Highway 401 traffic west of that junction has to use King Street East for a short distance to reach the Highway 8 Expressway.https://urbantoronto.ca/forum/threads/roads-highway-401-widening- highway-8-to-highway-410-mto-u-c-planned.10054/page-59 King Street East in Kitchener.  Route description   Goderich‚ÄìKitchener  Highway 8 begins at its western terminus in downtown Goderich, at the junction with Highway 21. It travels eastward as a rural two-lane highway (80 km/hr speed limit) with sections running through various towns and villages functioning as normal city roads. In Stratford, it begins overlapping with Highway 7, becoming a four-lane city road before becoming a four-lane rural highway at the eastern boundary of the city and then two lanes through the village of Shakespeare. West of New Hamburg, the combined Highway 7/8 widens into four- lanes and becomes a four-lane controlled-access highway/freeway just west of Baden, and continues into Kitchener (where the 7/8 freeway is known as the Conestoga Parkway). As the Conestoga Parkway runs through Kitchener as a six- lane freeway, Highway 8 splits off by turning southeastward via an interchange, which was opened in 1970, while Highway 7 continues on the Conestoga Parkway. Mainline traffic on Highway 8 heading northwest could continue under the Conestoga Parkway, where the route defaults to King Street, to enter downtown Kitchener or use a ramp to continue on Highway 8 by going onto the Conestoga Parkway. The eight-lane Conestoga Parkway east/north of this junction serves as a bypass of King Street through central Kitchener and Waterloo, as in the north end of Waterloo, the Conestoga Parkway and King Street intersect again. King Street north of the interchange with the Conestoga Parkway and Highway 8, looking south. King Street traffic has no direct access to the parkway. Highway 8 continues along as eight-lane freeway, which is also known as the Freeport Diversion or King Street Bypass (but is often referred to by area residents as the Highway 8 Expressway), until another junction with King Street East after which it becomes six and then four lanes. Originally, the Highway 8 Expressway ended at an at-grade Y-junction with King Street East, with traffic from Highway 8 treated as the mainline traffic at that intersection. Highway 8 and King Street then continued as a four-lane divided highway with access to adjacent commercial properties (60 km/hr speed limit) to Highway 401. In 1987, the Highway 8 Expressway was extended to provide a direct freeway link to Highway 401 eastbound with the non-public designation Highway 7187 (although it is signed as Highway 8), as the actual Highway 8 designation continues upon King Street East. As a result of the Highway 8 Expressway extension to Highway 401, the existing cloverleaf interchange between Highway 401 and King Street East was modified, with high-speed ramps directly connecting the Highway 8 Expressway to Highway 401 east of that interchange, however traffic on Highway 401 west of the interchange has to use has to use King Street East for a short distance to reach the Highway 8 Expressway.  Kitchener‚ÄìHamilton  Construction in 2011 to widen the Grand River crossing to eight lanes The historical Highway 8 then enters Cambridge, marked as Waterloo Regional Road 8 within the boundaries of the city, following city streets such as Shantz Hill Road, Fountain Street, King Street, Coronation Boulevard, and Dundas Street. It then continues as a King's Highway out of Cambridge and into Hamilton, meeting with Highway 5 at a roundabout in Peters Corners. Beyond this point, the road is no longer technically a King's Highway, and is officially designated as Hamilton Road 8, though numerous road signs and local custom still refer to it as Highway 8. From Peters Corners, Highway 8 continues through West Flamborough before turning south to descend the Niagara Escarpment into Dundas. In Dundas, Highway 8 follows King Street East, then turns south onto Main Street. Main Street changes names at Governor's Road to become Osler Drive. Once Highway 8 crosses the boundary into Hamilton proper, the road resumes the name Main Street. Highway 8 continues as Main Street through the Westdale neighbourhood of Hamilton, passing McMaster University, until it reaches Paradise Road just west of Highway 403. At this point, Highway 8 splits into two roads as it passes through the Hamilton downtown core. Highway 8 eastbound follows Main Street, which becomes a multi-lane one-way street from Paradise Road until its eventual intersection with King Street near Kensington Avenue in East Hamilton. Highway 8 westbound follows King Street, which is also a multi-lane one-way street between Kensington Avenue and Paradise Road, and then briefly follows Paradise Road itself to reconnect with Main Street. East of the intersection of King Street and Main Street, the two directions of Highway 8 merge, and the highway continues to follow Main Street. At the intersection of Main Street with Queenston Road, Highway 8 leaves Main Street and follows Queenston Road to continue its eastbound journey.

His middle and last name is based on department store owner Joseph Horne, founder of Horne's in Pittsburgh where Mark Frost is from, while his and his brother Jerry's first names are based on the ice cream brand Ben & Jerry's. The richest man in Twin Peaks, Horne is an archetypical 1980s cutthroat businessman, whose greatest desire in life appears to be the acquisition of wealth. As the series progressed, he was revealed, like many of the show's other characters, to have a hidden side; beneath his ruthless, greedy facade, he is a lonely, deeply depressed man who is disappointed with how his family and his life turned out. For the first sixteen episodes of the series, he is one of the primary antagonists not directly linked to the series' main storyline of the Laura Palmer murder. He is consistently under suspicion for Laura's murder, of which he is wholly innocent, while never being suspected of the myriad criminal activities of which he is actually guilty. Up until the revelation of Laura's true killer, Horne was used by the writers as a red herring to prevent spoilers from leaking out; at least two scenes were filmed to lead people to believe that Horne was the real killer, so that the true identity of the killer could remain a secret. Character background Ben Horne is one of the two richest and most powerful individuals of Twin Peaks; per Sheriff Harry Truman, Horne \\"owns half the town.\\" He owns and runs The Great Northern Hotel, the town's only apparent travel lodgings; the Great Northern also acts, on occasion, as a de facto town hall, and the only place in Twin Peaks suitable for a wedding reception, making it one of the hubs of the community. In addition to the Great Northern, Ben owns and runs Horne's, the town's only department store, and One Eyed Jacks, a casino/brothel just over the Canada‚ÄìUS border. His would-be monopoly on the town's economy is challenged only by Josie Packard, the owner of the Packard Saw Mill, one of the few major businesses in town which Horne doesn't own. At the outset of the series, Ben has been involved in an affair for some time with Catherine Martell. The relationship is part of Ben's intricate plot to kill her, destroy the mill, become the beneficiary of her life insurance, and take sole ownership of the land on which the mill sits, which he intends to turn into a luxury country club. Ben is depicted as both extremely intelligent and mercilessly cutthroat. He acts as a contrast to the simple people of Twin Peaks‚Äîwhile he lacks their folk wisdom, he is nonetheless extremely intelligent, worldly, and well read, capable of quoting Shakespearean sonnets on cue. His usual attire further serves to distance him from the town‚Äîwhile the majority of the populace of Twin Peaks wear western wear or clothing popular in the 1950s, Horne dresses in fashionable double breasted suits and designer track suits, both staples of 1980s fashion; upon first seeing him, Agent Dale Cooper singles him out as a \\"glad-handing dandy.\\" Ben has a family, who live with him in the owner's quarters at the Great Northern. His wife, Sylvia, and son, Johnny, only appear briefly on the series; Sylvia is a put- upon trophy wife, while Johnny is a developmentally disabled 27-year-old who spends his days playing cowboys and Indians. Ben also has a brother, Jerry Horne, who acts as his business partner, emissary, and best friend. His teenaged daughter Audrey is both his pride and joy and the thorn in his side; like him, she is intelligent, business savvy and ruthless, but she is also rebellious and delights in embarrassing him with outrageous public stunts. Ben is very close to his private attorney, Leland Palmer, who has worked for him for at least five years prior to the start of the series. Ben takes a particular shine to Leland's daughter, Laura, who as a child encompassed all the qualities lacking in Audrey: Quiet, good natured, and sweet. For this reason, Ben showers Laura with attention, clandestinely giving her presents through Leland, who agrees to the arrangement as it both makes Laura happy and makes Leland look good in his daughter's eyes. As Laura grows older, Ben develops romantic feelings for her, and he sees in her all of the possibilities his own life once held; her photo takes a place of honor on his desk, while there is none of Audrey to be seen. Ben and Laura have a torrid affair shortly before Laura's death, after Laura‚Äîwithout Ben's knowledge‚Äîcomes to work at One Eyed Jacks. The relationship quickly falls apart, as Laura does not really have feelings for Horne, but wants only the thrill of sleeping with a wealthy, older man. Before she dies, Laura threatens to expose the affair to the entire town. Role on series At the start of the series, Horne is recruiting Norwegian businessmen to invest in his plans for Ghostwood, an elaborate country club that would take the place of Twin Peaks' scenic Ghostwood Forest. His plans are interrupted when Laura Palmer, the daughter of Ben's lawyer, Leland Palmer, is found murdered. The murder both puts Leland out of commission and gives Audrey the opportunity to paint Twin Peaks as a dangerous place, frightening away her father's potential investors. As the first season progresses, Horne attempts to juggle his various personal and business problems in light of Laura's murder. While putting on a brave face and acting on behalf of the stricken Palmers to retrieve Laura's body and transport it for burial, Horne's vulnerability is revealed when Audrey confronts him with knowledge of his affair with Laura. Following Laura's funeral, Horne pours all of his energies into obtaining the Packard Saw Mill land, some of the most valuable real estate in Twin Peaks. He hires local drug runner Leo Johnson to burn down the mill with Catherine trapped inside, and then obtains the services of hitman Hank Jennings to murder Leo so that no one will ever know the two worked together. Horne's plan goes terribly awry, though: The mill doesn't completely burn; Catherine's body is never found, which prevents Horne from collecting on her life insurance policy (a matter further complicated by Catherine having made an intentional clerical error to foil Horne in the event of her death); Leo survives being shot by Hank; and Audrey is kidnapped by the staff of One Eyed Jacks, who intend to use her to extort Horne for millions of dollars while simultaneously enacting a hostile takeover of the business. Horne begrudgingly gives Cooper the requested ransom money, then hires Hank to trail Cooper, kill everyone involved in retrieving Audrey, and bring back Audrey and the money himself. Ultimately, Cooper himself rescues Audrey and returns to Twin Peaks with both her and the money intact. Shortly after Audrey's safe return, a misunderstanding in a clue provided to Cooper by MIKE leads to Horne being arrested for the murder of Laura Palmer. Horne is left with the incompetent Jerry as his lawyer, his only advice being, \\"Get another lawyer.\\" Simultaneously, Catherine Martel re- surfaces, alive and well, having survived the fire. Posing as a foreign investor, she first arranges for Horne to purchase the Mill Land and Ghostwood from Josie with a bogus check, and then blackmails him into signing over Josie's 50% to her in exchange for an alibi as to his whereabouts the night Laura Palmer was murdered. Desperate, Horne signs over his deed to Catherine, who then reneges on her promise to provide him an alibi. Horne is left trapped in jail, where he begins to break down and reminisce about his childhood. Eventually, Horne is used as a pawn to draw out the real killer; Cooper brings him to a meeting of suspects at the Roadhouse, which is also attended by the Great Northern's elderly room service waiter. The waiter, under the influence of The Giant, identifies Leland Palmer‚Äîunder the influence of the demonic spirit BOB‚Äîas Laura's killer. In order to trap Leland, Cooper lies and tells everyone that he has positively identified Ben Horne as the real killer, and then gives Leland permission to accompany Horne to the jail to act as his counsel. Leland/BOB, unaware of the ruse, accompany Cooper and Horne to the jailhouse; just as Cooper and Sheriff Truman are about to lead Horne into an interrogation room, they hold him back and throw Leland/BOB inside, trapping him. The revelation shocks Horne, who can only mutter \\"Leland...\\" before he is allowed to go home. Horne slips into a deep depression before ultimately suffering a nervous breakdown and a psychotic break. He becomes convinced that he is Confederate General Robert E. Lee, leading the South in a victorious campaign against the Union. His psychiatrist, Dr. Lawrence Jacoby, theorizes that Horne is at least partially aware of reality, and that his fantasy is an attempt to reverse his recent misfortunes and start anew. Jerry, Audrey, and Bobby Briggs, under Jacoby's direction, serve to enable Horne's fantasy up to a surrender of the Union at Appomattox. Horne suffers a blackout, from which he awakens with a desire to atone for his past sins, whilst simultaneously seeking peaceful revenge on Catherine. To meet both of these ends, he launches an environmentalist campaign to prevent Catherine from re-building the mill or building anything in Ghostwood; he learns that the forest is the habitat of an endangered species, the \\"Pine Weasel\\", and manages to get the majority of the town on board to block any of Catherine's real estate developments. He makes a genuine attempt to atone for his past crimes, gives up smoking, and begins building a close relationship with Audrey, to whom he begins to teach the family business. As part of his \\"new life,\\" Horne attempts to make amends with Mrs. Hayward, with whom he had an affair 17 years before, an affair which produced Donna Hayward; Ben wants to both make up for his indiscretions with Mrs. Hayward and get to know the daughter he never had. In the series finale, Horne comes to the Hayward home to reveal everything to a heartbroken Donna. Enraged, Doc Hayward, Donna's father, punches him, resulting in Horne splitting his head open on a piece of fireplace equipment. Benjamin Horne returns 25 years later in the third series of limited series, still the owner of the Great Northern. He and Sylvia are divorced, and he resists a flirtation with his secretary Beverly Paige. After their grandson Richard (Audrey's son) terrorizes Johnny and Sylvia and robs her, Horne refuses to reimburse Sylvia for the robbery. When Richard kills a young boy and brutally beats a witness, Benjamin pays her medical bills and the cost of the funeral. Red herring for Laura's killer At least two scenes were filmed to lead fans to believe that Ben Horne was Laura's killer: * In one episode, MIKE takes Cooper to the Great Northern, where he claims the killer is. When Ben Horne approaches Cooper and MIKE, MIKE has what amounts to an epileptic seizure and says that the killer's scent is on Ben. Only after Leland is revealed as the killer does the scene make sense and exonerate Ben‚ÄîLeland and Ben had just been alone together in a room. * More blatantly, a scene was filmed for Episode 14 where Horne is revealed as Bob's host. The scene was filmed so that it would spread false rumors and draw people away from the possibility of Leland being the killer. The scene plays out exactly as the one originally broadcast, wherein Leland looks into a mirror to reveal the face of Bob before killing Maddy; however, here, Ben Horne is in the Palmer house, and it is he who murders Maddy. The scene was never broadcast on TV and is not included in the Gold Box DVD set.

His works are initially listed by Opus number (Op.), followed by works without Op. number (WoO). Other features shown are translation of titles, key, scoring, year of composition, genre, information about texts and their authors, a link to the Max-Reger-Institute, which provides detailed information about times of composition, performance and publishing, and a link to the free score when available.  History  Reger was a German composer, born in Brand in 1873. He studied music theory in Sondershausen, then piano and theory, in Wiesbaden. The first compositions to which he assigned opus numbers were chamber music and Lieder. A pianist himself, he composed works for both piano and organ. Reger returned to his parental home in 1898, where he composed his first work for choir and orchestra, ' (Hymn to singing), Op. 21. He moved to Munich in 1901. In 1907 he was appointed musical director at the Leipzig University and professor at the Royal Conservatory in Leipzig. In 1911 Reger was appointed Hofkapellmeister (music director) at the court of Duke Georg II of Saxe- Meiningen, retaining his master class at the Leipzig conservatory. In 1913 he composed four tone poems on paintings by Arnold B√∂cklin (Vier Tondichtungen nach A. B√∂cklin), including Die Toteninsel ('Isle of the Dead'), as his Op. 128. He gave up the court position in 1914 for health reasons. In response to World War I, he thought in 1914 already to compose a choral work to commemorate the fallen of the war. He began to set the Latin Requiem but abandoned the work as a fragment. In 1915 he moved to Jena, still teaching in Leipzig. He composed in Jena the Hebbel Requiem for soloist, choir and orchestra. Reger died in Leipzig on 11 May 1916. Reger assigned opus numbers to major works himself. In his compositions for solo voices and for choirs, he set poems by notable lyricists, including contemporaries, such as Gabriele D'Annunzio, Otto Julius Bierbaum, Joseph von Eichendorff, Friedrich Hebbel, Detlev von Liliencron and Friedrich R√ºckert.  Table of compositions  Reger's works with an opus number are listed first, then works designated as WoO (work without opus number). Details to compositions follow, such as song titles and names of poets for a collection of songs. The scoring is given if it cannot be recognized from the title or the genre: for example songs (Lieder, Ges√§nge) are normally for voice and piano, in a sonata the named solo instrument is usually accompanied by piano, and choral works are for four-part choir a cappella, unless otherwise noted.

Grubbs, 547 U.S. 90 (2006), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States involving the constitutionality of \\"anticipatory\\" search warrants under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court ruled that such warrants, which are issued in advance of a \\"triggering condition\\" that makes them executable, are constitutional and do not need to describe that condition on their face. In this particular decision, which arose from a federal child pornography prosecution, the Court ruled that a warrant that was predicated on the undercover delivery of a videotape to the defendant's home, but did not state this on its face, was properly issued and executed because it described the place to be searched and the objects to be seized, and the search was conducted after the delivery was made. Evidence seized from the defendant's house from that search was therefore admissible in court against him. Background of the case Criminal investigation The defendant, Jeffrey Grubbs, became the subject of an undercover federal investigation and prosecution when he ordered a videotape containing child pornography from a website operated by an undercover U.S. postal inspector. The Postal Inspection Service then arranged a controlled delivery of the tape to Grubbs. An application was submitted to a magistrate judge for the Eastern District of California requesting an \\"anticipatory\\" search warrant, so-called because it is based upon the probable cause that at some time in the future (but not at present) certain evidence of a crime will be located at a specified place). An affidavit accompanying the warrant application stated as the \\"triggering condition\\" that the search warrant would not be executed until the tape had been delivered and taken into Grubbs' home. However, this condition was omitted from the issued warrant. Two days later, the undercover delivery occurred and Grubbs' house was searched after the tape was taken inside. The videotape and other items were seized, and Grubbs was arrested. District Court and Court of Appeals proceedings A grand jury for the Eastern District of California indicted Grubbs on one count of \\"receiving a visual depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.\\"18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2252(a)(2). Grubbs' defense counsel, Mark Reichel moved to suppress the evidence seized during the search of his residence, arguing in part that the warrant was invalid because it failed to list the triggering condition and that the 4th Amendment requires officers to provide a copy of the search warrant to the homeowner when conducting a search. After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied the motion. Grubbs pleaded guilty, but reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.United States v. Grubbs, 377 F.3d 1072 (9th Cir. 2004), amended, 389 F.3d 1306. Relying on Ninth Circuit precedent, the court held that the Fourth Amendment's requirement that warrants describe with particularity the things, persons, or places to be searched fully applied to the triggering conditions necessary for an anticipatory search warrant.377 F.3d at 1077-1078. Because the postal inspectors failed to present the application affidavit--the only document in which the triggering conditions were listed--to Grubbs or his wife, the court ruled that the \\"warrant was...inoperative, and the search was illegal.\\" The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed.  Opinion of the Court  Justice Antonin Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.The Supreme Court, 2005 Term ‚Äî Leading Cases, 120 Harv. L. Rev. 154 (2006). The judgment was unanimous as to the eight members of the Court participating,Justice Samuel Alito, having been confirmed thirteen days after the case was heard for argument, did not participate. as were the first two parts of Scalia's opinion that upheld the constitutionality of anticipatory warrants in general. The third and last part of the Court's opinion, which further ruled that anticipatory warrants were not required by the Fourth Amendment to state their triggering requirements on their face, was joined by four Justices; the remaining three concurred separately in an opinion by Justice David Souter. Scalia's majority opinion The defendant had argued that anticipatory warrants in general violated the Fourth Amendment's requirement that \\"no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,\\" because the anticipated probable cause does not exist at the time of the warrant's issuance. The Court first noted that the courts of appeals had unanimously rejected this argument. It asserted that all warrants are in a sense \\"anticipatory,\\" because any search is only reasonable if there is probable cause for it when the search is conducted. \\"In the typical case where the police seek permission to search a house for an item they believe is already located there, the magistrate's determination that there is probable cause for the search amounts to a prediction that the item will still be there when the warrant is executed.\\" The Court concluded that this makes anticipatory warrants no different in principle from ordinary warrants. When the anticipatory warrant is predicated on a triggering condition, the Fourth Amendment requires that there is probable cause to believe that the triggering condition will occur, and that if it occurs, that there is a fair probability that the contraband will be found at the place to be searched. In this case, the warrant application satisfied both conditions, based on the delivery of the tape as the triggering condition. Regarding the warrant's failure to describe that triggering condition, Scalia wrote in Part III of the Court's opinion that, contrary to the Ninth Circuit's ruling, the Fourth Amendment does not have a general \\"particularity requirement.\\" Warrants must only describe with particularity \\"the place to be searched\\" and \\"the persons or things to be seized,\\" and the Court stated that it had previously rejected attempts to expand that scope.The Court cited to Dalia v. United States, 441 U.S. 238 (1979), in which the defendant challenged a wiretap warrant that omitted the fact that covert entry into the defendant's office was required to install the listening device. The Court ruled against the defendant on the basis that warrants did not need to specify the manner in which they were to be executed. The defendant also argued that any \\"precondition to the valid exercise of executive power\\" must be identified on the face of the warrant. The Court denied that there was such a constitutional principle, especially considering that while a judge must find probable cause to issue a warrant, the warrant itself does not need to state the basis for the judge's finding. Finally, the defendant claimed that the omission of the triggering condition prevents the person whose property is being seized of being notified of the lawfulness of the search and seizure. However, the Court pointed out that there is no requirement that the property owner be shown the warrant prior to the search. Souter's concurrence Justice Souter wrote separately to \\"qualify some points\\" made in Part III of the Court's opinion. Though joining the majority in reversing the Ninth Circuit's decision, Souter wrote that the term \\"warrant\\" itself in the Fourth Amendment may be read to mean \\"a statement of authority that sets out the time at which (or in the case of anticipatory warrants, the condition on which) the authority begins.\\" He stated that the majority's rule against requiring this condition may cause consequences of \\"constitutional significance,\\" as when an officer who is ignorant of the triggering condition executes the warrant before the condition occurs; Souter wrote that the government should be held to the terms of the condition in that situation, despite the unconditionally framed warrant. Souter also stated that the interest a property owner has in being notified of the accurate terms of a search has yet to be determined.

With sales of more than 40 million units and downloads sold, he has earned over 20 gold and multi-platinum RIAA Certification awards. As a recording artist, he recorded for Capitol Records and established the video department at Capitol just prior to MTV. He has made the Billboard Magazine Top 40 list in multiple genres almost every year since he began in 1976.Haley, Adria ‚Äì \\"The 35th annual edition 2012 Songwriters Market\\", Readers Digest Books, pages 99‚Äì104, p. 213 Mathews owns and operates a private studio, TikiTown, along with four production and publishing companies. He is the Chief Creative Officer of proTunes, an online business- to-business music search and licensing solution based in Beverly Hills and Dublin. He also serves as Chairman of the San Francisco Bay Area Council of Little Kids Rock, named 2014 top-rated nonprofit,name=Little Kids Rockhttp://greatnonprofits.org/org/little-kids-rock which provides a nationwide program of free musical education and instruments to impoverished public schools. Early days Mathews began his professional music career very young. At 15 he got his first break playing with American blues musician Elvin Bishop at San Francisco's legendary Fillmore Auditorium. Session musician to songwriter In 1973 Mathews met future long-time collaborator Ron Nagle. Nagle was already an established songwriter and recording artist for Warner Brothers and had made the cult-classic, 'Bad Rice'. Nagle and Mathews teamed up and began to write and record material in Nagle's garage studio in San Francisco. Turning 18, Mathews moved to Sausalito, CA, sharing a house with David Jenkins (musician) of Pablo Cruise, making a living as a session musician while writing and producing 'blueprints for records' with Nagle. Some of the session work included radio and television jingles and Mathews soon began producing them for various ad agencies, playing all the musical instruments and singing the vocals himself. Strangely, this path paved the way for Roy Orbison to be the very first artist Mathews ever produced in the recording studio. Mathews achieved this having convinced a large advertising agency he could get Orbison to license his biggest worldwide hit, Oh, Pretty Woman for \\"Tone Soap\\", a women's soap product. The campaign was such a success that Mathews followed it up with another legendary artist, Johnny Cash on Victoria Station (restaurant) radio ads with exactly the same formula. These projects proved to be Mathews' first, and a first for commercials to feature major hit recording artists in ad campaigns. Ron Nagle's producer from his solo record, Jack Nitzsche, heard some of the duo's new material and hired them to work on film scores and record projects. Nitzsche was the persuasive, cognitive musical wheel in the studio works of Phil Spector and the early to mid-period records by The Rolling Stones. His arrangements adorned many hits by Jackie DeShannon, Gene Pitney, Darlene Love, The Crystals, The Righteous Brothers, Neil Young, etc. although he had only one hit under his name, \\"The Lonely Surfer\\", released in 1963. Later, he would win an Oscar for co- composing \\"Up Where We Belong.\\" In Nitzsche, Mathews found his mentor and 'godfather' in the music business and high-profile projects followed soon after. Performing and producing sessions under Nitzsche, Mathews worked on his first movie soundtrack, the multiple Academy Awards winning film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and was Nitzsche's multi-instrumentalist and close assistant on various recording projects with major artists such as Mick Jagger, Barbra Streisand, Glen Campbell, Ry Cooder, Dr. John and a plethora of others. In 1977, Barbra Streisand heard one of Mathews and Nagle's songs at a meeting with Jack Nitzsche. She asked to meet with the two composers and they got along so well, the three immediately began writing together in a bungalow at The Beverly Hills Hotel. The end result was Mathews and Nagle landed two previously written songs on Superman, selling more than five million units upon release. Mathews also assisted Nitzsche in writing the arrangements for the album. Mathews and Nagle also wrote and published songs by The Tubes including the cult favorite, \\"Don't Touch Me There\\". Also in 1977, Mathews performed several major roles on Glen Campbell's #1 crossover hit, Southern Nights which went #1 on the pop, rock and country charts. Mathews also worked on the album of the same name, Southern Nights on Capitol Records by not only performing multiple instruments on the sessions but also choosing material for the album (including the title song), rehearsing the material with Campbell and hiring the musicians for Nitzsche who did the arrangements. Mathews' friend Robin Williams contacted him to help with a musical finale for his sold out stand-up comedy shows in San Francisco at The Boarding House. Following that success, Williams took the show to New York at the legendary Copacabana. Mathews urged Williams to record some shows, which led to Williams signing a record deal with Casablanca Records and recording the Copacabana shows. The result was an instant Grammy Award winning album, \\"Reality...What a Concept\\", the first Grammy winning project for both Williams and Mathews. Acting As an actor, Mathews starred as Fluke Starbucker (parodying Luke Skywalker) in the 1977 Star Wars parody Hardware Wars. It is considered to be the most profitable short film of all time, grossing in excess of $1,000,000 on a paltry $8,000 budget; its relative profit margin was even better than Star Wars. George Lucas said in a 1999 interview on the UK's The Big Breakfast television show that Hardware Wars was his favorite Star Wars parody. In 2003, the film was honored by Lucasfilm when it was given the Pioneer Award at that year's The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards. In August 2010, Time magazine listed it as one of the top 10 Star Wars fanfilms. Capitol Records recording artist Following Mathews' writing and production work with artists on A&M; Records, the label approached him and Nagle to build a band project. Nagle and Mathews, funded by A&M;, wrote and produced material under the name D≈´rocs. The duo ended up signing with Capitol Records as a production company to produce artists already on the label and/or new artists they brought in. Capitol's Artists and repertoire division pushed for Mathews and Nagle to record their own album as the first project with the label and the duo agreed although the so-called 'band', Durocs, but never had any intention of performing live. Originally labeled as new wave and power pop, D≈´rocs wrote and produced material that was more diverse and explored Mathews and Nagle's interests in the styles of The Brill Building, Leiber and Stoller and Phil Spector with Mathews playing more virtually all of the musical instruments earning him the title of a 'wunderkind' in Rolling Stone Magazine from writer and senior editor, Ben Fong-Torres. Being writers and producers first and foremost, Durocs never considered putting a band together in support of the album which shocked Capitol's executives, especially the promotion department which had no idea how to promote the 'non-band'. En lieu of touring, they produced lavish, humorous and highly praised music videos for their two singles which ultimately proved to be slightly ahead of their time. D≈´rocs left Capitol late in 1980 to focus on production and songwriting for other artists but before exiting, they set a live pig loose in the Capitol Tower during a quarterly executive meeting with the label.Liberatore, Paul ‚Äì \\"Press Play: The D≈´rocs 1979 Masterpiece Get Re-Issued\\", Marin Independent Journal, August 10, 2012, p. 15 In 1981 the video department D≈´rocs built and helped staff became a revenue cash cow at Capitol as the label was prepared to make promotional videos for the new MTV television channel.Felton, David ‚Äì \\"D≈´rocs, Pigging out with Ron Nagle and Scott Mathews\\", Rolling Stone Magazine, November 15, 1979, p.20 The Beach Boys Mathews' talents on the D≈´rocs project caught the attention of Carl Wilson who passed the LP on to Brian Wilson and they invited Mathews to play and sing with The Beach Boys in the studio. After becoming close friends and musical collaborators, Mathews was invited to become a full-fledged member of The Beach Boys, thus replacing their brother, Dennis Wilson who had fallen on tough times.Stebbins, Jon ‚Äì \\"The Real Beach Boys\\", ECW Press He became known as the fifth Beach Boy after his consistent behind-the-scenes work. Other work In 1989, Mathews recorded and toured the world with Todd Rundgren. Mathews worked closely with Rundgren on recording Nearly Human and for the tours, Rundgren had a U-shaped stage built for Mathews so he could perform all forms of percussion, keyboards, guitar (on tour, Mathews usually used Clapton's famous psychedelic painted Gibson SG, The Fool, which Clapton used for most of his work in Cream) as well as being a featured vocalist. Mathews and Nagle co-wrote the 1990 Dave Edmunds worldwide hit and album title song, \\"Closer to the Flame\\". In 1991, Mathews moved to Marin County and founded Hit or Myth Productions, Inc. Using his experience from the corporate music industry and his wont to escape it, he began his own independent dream job, and under Hit or Myth Productions, Mathews hired his own A&R; staff for recruiting primarily emerging artists and bought a split level house in Mill Valley, CA on the edge of San Francisco Bay which became his ideal private recording studio, TikiTown. The studio, named for the enormous Tiki statues that surround it, was custom-built on the philosophy of intimacy, comfort and to not feeling like a recording studio. Mathews said he felt he had lived half of his life 'in caves' so TikiTown features sweeping views of the bay, providing artists with a 'bubble' environment to focus on their music without any disturbance or interaction from anyone. Van Morrison was one of the first artists Mathews brought into the studio and he loved it so much he set up an entire large room as a gym so he could work out while there. TikiTown is also renowned for its museum level quality of music memorabilia and ultra rare Hall of Fame type pieces. In 1993 Mathews and music journalist Joel Selvin met with Dick Dale in Twentynine Palms, CA. Their meeting convinced Dale to come out of retirement and record with Mathews. Dale experienced a renewed interest in his music and earned the #1 college radio record for his Tribal Thunder comeback LP.Selvin, Joel ‚Äì \\"Smartass: The Music Journalism of Joel Selvin: California Rock and Roll\\", Parthenon/SLG Books, p.319-324, 2010 He also performed multi-instruments and vocals on Todd Rundgren's Live in Chicago and provided songwriting for Dave Edmunds' King Biscuit Flower Hour. In December 2011, Mathews signed on as executive producer with the Hong Kong-based, Far West Entertainment. Less than two months after, Mathews produced the #1 Billboard track \\"Dance On\\" with Pan Asian girl group Blush. Quincy Jones signed on for management of the band and declared at the 2013 Grammy Awards, \\"they are the next big thing.\\" On May 22, after nearly a year in negotiations with Capitol Records, Real Gone Music released the original D≈´rocs record on CD and downloads. The Durocs negotiated for a limited edition vinyl series to be released exactly 33 1/3 years (representing the RPMs of an album) after the original record. Along with the original LP are eight previously unheard D≈´rocs 'bone-us' tracks, all recorded shortly after the Capitol release. Worldwide reviews upon this re-release read; 'one of rock's lost masterpieces', 'a thrilling discovery ‚Äì doesn't sound dated a bit', ' a lost gem ‚Äì totally devastating catchy tunes', 'the hallmark of quality music' and has prompted more Durocs recordings to be prepared for release. On January 24, 2014, Mathews helped arrange for his longtime friend, Hal Blaine to be inducted at the 29th annual TEC Awards Hall of Fame at the NAMM show in Anaheim, CA. The evening also provided for a reunion with Todd Rundgren who won the Les Paul Award for his musical innovation. On October 19, Mathews was honored with a Milley Award, a local Bay Area award for 'recognition and appreciation for his outstanding achievement in performing, creating and demonstrating his significant body of work, service to the arts community and artistic vision, diligence and perseverance.' In his speech upon receiving the award, he spoke; \\"It has been at least a couple lifetime's of great fortune and I'm most grateful for it. I have been able to live quite comfortably in the Bay Area, hermetically sealed in the recording studio, creating new music rather than re-creating it on stage and living the life of a carny. But I don't think the past can possibly provide what the future promises and deeply feel my best work is ahead of me. The rear-view mirror is so much smaller than the windshield.\\" Under Mathews' guidance and leadership, Little Kids Rock's Bay Area Council raised more than $360,000 in 2015 to go toward instrument donations, curriculum development, and other resources that will directly impact the lives of 6,572 students in 97 local schools who are currently running Little Kids Rock's free program, also funding training and donations for 50 new teachers to launch Little Kids Rock's music program in their schools, enriching the lives of 3,240 additional students. By the end of 2015, Little Kids Rock unlocked a total of 9,812 students' inner music makers in 147 schools.

It is thought to have been a herbivorous small ornithopod.  History of discovery  The first two Jeholosaurus specimens were found in 2000 at Lujiatun near Beipiao City, Liaoning Province, China, and named and described the same year by Xu Xing, Wang Xioalin and You Hailu. The type and only known species is Jeholosaurus shangyuanensis. The generic name Jeholosaurus means \\"lizard from Jehol\\"; Jehol is the name of a historical province situated in western Liaoning and northern Hebei. The specific name refers to the geographical area of Shangyuan where the fossil site is located. The type specimen of Jeholosaurus, on which the genus is based, is IVPP V 12529\\\\. It was found in a layer of the early Yixian Formation, dating from the early Aptian, about a 126 million years old. The layers consist of fluvial sandstone interspersed with tuff and it is thought that an enormous volcanic eruption occurred burying everything within a fifty to sixty mile radius. The holotype contains a compressed skull and a partial postcranial skeleton. The second specimen, IVPP V 12530, was referred to the species. It consists of a better preserved, perhaps smaller, skull and some neck vertebrae. Both specimens represent juvenile or at least subadult individuals.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 275 Description Size Jeholosaurus was a small bipedal herbivore.

A primitive ornithopod from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of Liaoning. Vertebrata PalAsiatica 38(4)318-325. Anatomy Restoration Both skulls are incomplete and had to be partially restored. The referred specimens shows an extremely large orbit compared to the skull size, with a length of 40% of the total skull length. Its snout is short, also comprising 40% of the skull length. Both traits are indicative of a juvenile individual. Reconstructed skeleton (Dinosaurland, Lyme Regis) The premaxilla has six teeth and the maxilla has at least thirteen teeth. Although the back, maxillary, teeth are fan-shaped like those of a plant eater, the front premaxillary teeth are narrower and longer, more like a carnivorous dinosaur. This may mean that Jeholosaurus was omnivorous, eating both plants and animals. The deeply inset ventral margin in the maxilla suggests fleshy cheeks may have been present. The nasals have large foramina dorsolaterally and a midline fossa. No palpebrae are preserved. Though cervical vertebrae and caudal vertebrae have been preserved, their exact number is unknown. The femur is bowed and has an anterior trochanter slightly lower than the greater trochanter and a third as narrow as the latter. They are separated by a shallow cleft. Between the condyles of the lower femur the (anterior) extensor groove is absent. The fourth trochanter is pendant and located in a rather high position. The foot has four metatarsals. The longest is metatarsal III with a length of ; it is placed more anteriorly than the other metatarsals. Metatarsal I is more posterior and its upper part is transversely reduced to a splint. Some distinguishing traits of Jeholosaurus include: enlarged laterodorsal nasal foramina; a quadratojugal fenestra more than 25% maximum quadratojugal length; a quadratojugal less than 30% of skull height; a predentary with almost 150% of premaxillary body length; a dentary extending posteriorly almost to the posterior border of the angular; and the claw of the third toe being longer than the other third toe phalanges.  Phylogeny  Jeholosaurus is an ornithischian, as is shown by its ornithischian four- pronged pelvic structure with a pubis bone pointing downward and backwards, parallel to the ischium, while a forward-pointing prepubic process supports the abdomen. The describers did not assign Jeholosaurus to any family, limiting themselves to a placement as Ornithischia incertae sedis. Using the comparative method, they pointed out some similarities to basal Euornithopoda: a small antorbital fenestra; the foramen on the quadratojugal; a large quadratic foramen; and the absence of an external fenestra in the lower jaw. However, they also noticed more derived euornithopod traits, such as the form of the greater and anterior trochanter of the thighbone, although the premaxilla not reaching the lacrimal, the high jaw joint and the premaxilla being on the same level as the maxilla, were again basal traits. The fused mandibular symphysis might indicate a relation with the Marginocephalia. Very basal ornithischian traits included the presence of six teeth in the premaxilla with only a short toothless sector in front and a short hiatus with the maxillary teeth. Later cladistic analyses have recovered a basal position in the (Eu)ornithopoda. The following cladogram was based on analysis by Makovicky et al., 2011. The following cladogram was based on analysis by Zheng and colleagues in 2009.Zheng, X-.T., You, H.-L., Xu, X. and Dong, Z.-M.

The trail ascends Mount Le Conte, the tallest (and sixth highest) mountain east of the Mississippi River and offers outstanding views before joining the Rainbow Falls Trail before terminating near the LeConte Lodge. Vital information * The Bullhead Trail is the least traveled route to the summit of Mount Le Conte (elev. ; 2,010 m) * A short connector trail that extends from the Sugarlands Visitor Center to the Rainbow Falls Trail is one way to access the trailhead. * The trailhead is located inside of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, off Cherokee Orchard Road, 3.4 miles (5.5 km) from Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Landmarks/overlooks * Bullhead * English Mountain/Sugarland Mountain overlook * Balsam Point Trail synopsis Trailhead to English Mountain overlook One of the many overlooks along the final portion of the Bullhead Trail. The beginning of the Bullhead Trail is, for all intents and purposes, actually the trailhead to the Rainbow Falls Trail. Both trails are designated the same parking area, and because of their proximity (the two paths are separated only by a spur trail) many hikers choose to ascend one trail (usually the Rainbow Falls Trail) and descend the other. Given this, however, the trail is still the least popular route along Mount Le Conte, probably because of its isolation (in the woods, near to but away from its crowded neighbor trail) and that it contains no spectacular landmarks along its path. But it is this isolation that makes the trail so desirable to those who favor solitude when hiking. The trail itself begins gently underneath the covering of young hemlocks, quickly offering views through the brush of a second growth forest. The first two miles (3 km) of the trail consist of much switchbacking, as the hiker slowly but steadily gains elevation towards the Le Conte summit, and includes a pass just beneath Bullhead, a Le Conte heath bald which, from a distance, apparently gives the impression of a bull's head, from which the trail is named. At a boulder field offers the hiker a glimpse into the Le Conte Creek valley below, even offering views of the Space Needle in downtown Gatlinburg. The path then switches back over Bullhead and continues along toward the top of the mountain when it passes a large boulder directly to the left of the trail at . On a clear day, the hiker can see magnificent views of both English and Sugarland mountains to the northeast and southwest respectively. The rock is large enough to provide a suitable resting place close to the halfway mark of the trail. Platform nearly halfway along Bullhead Trail from which English and Sugarland mountains can be seen. English Mountain overlook to the Leconte Lodge Moving along toward the LeConte Lodge, the footpath soon becomes very rocky and enters into the coniferous Fraser fir/red spruce forest ubiquitous to the higher elevations of the national park. The dead Frasers are the unfortunate result of the influx of the non-native balsam wooly adelgid, an insect that latches on and feasts from the tree. The national park is undergoing extensive work and research in trying to save the remaining trees, but has so far had little success. The trail becomes quite strenuous for a short period as it ascends and conquers Balsam Point, at , but, in return, it offers almost unmatched views to the left of the mountains below. Shortly hereafter the hiker arrives at the junction with the Rainbow Falls Trail, and, after the final jaunt, the LeConte Lodge is found immediately ahead. The LeConte Lodge provides the only commercial lodging in the national park, as it operates about 10 rustic cabins with no electricity or appliances. The Lodge also operates an office which provides t-shirts and other merchandise for hikers and various amenities for guests of the lodge. For many, this signals the end of their journey, but the actual peaks of Le Conte all have separate trails a short distance from the lodge, with Cliff Tops and Myrtle Point each offering expansive panoramas of the mountains and valleys below.

An accountant by training, he learned to identify underpriced companies and acquired them, often as sole stakeholder. His shipping interests were combined into the giant Ellerman Lines, and he also invested in newspapers, breweries, coal and prestige London property. Despite his huge wealth, his personal life was notably modest and private. Early life Ellerman was born in Kingston upon Hull, the only son of a Lutheran ship broker and corn merchant who had emigrated to England from Hamburg, Germany in 1850, and an English mother.Was this the richest (and most secretive) British tycoon ever?, Daily Telegraph, 22 May 2006. Retrieved 20 January 2010 His father died when he was nine, leaving an estate of ¬£600.Rubinstein, W.D. Men of Property (2006), page 61. Ellerman spent part of his childhood in France and briefly attended King Edward VI School in Birmingham. Ellerman did not get on with his mother and lived independently from the age of fourteen, when he was articled to a Birmingham chartered accountant. After passing his articles he moved to London, where he turned down a partnership in one of the leading firms of the day to found his own practice, J. Ellerman & Co, in the City of London in 1886. He was one of the first important British businessmen with a professional qualification in accountancy. He was also one of the first businessmen to use modern accounting methods to identify underpriced companies that should be well suited for takeover. The secretive billionaire, BBC News, 20 August 2009. Retrieved 20 January 2010 From 1890, Ellerman began to create major business groups by buying up established businesses, typically ones which had a good product but were in managerial decline after the death of the founder. Most of these businesses flourished under his management. He raised funds from other investors where necessary, but held large stakes personally. The first of these groups was the Brewery and Commercial Investment Trust which appreciated by 1,300% in nine years. Shipping In 1892, Ellerman made his first move into shipping by leading a consortium which purchased the Leyland Line from the late Frederick Richards Leyland, one of the largest shipowners in Britain. In 1901 Ellerman sold this business to J.P. Morgan for ¬£1.2 million, who immediately folded it into the International Mercantile Marine Co.. Ellerman, however, immediately began to buy other shipping lines, and in 1902 he combined his interests into Ellerman Lines. He continued to expand the business, making inroads into the South African, Atlantic and Indian routes while buying rival lines on a regular basis. In 1916 he paid ¬£4.1 million for Thomas Wilson Sons & Co. of Hull, which had once been the largest privately owned shipping line in the world. The newly acquired company was renamed Ellerman's Wilson Line and it operated as a separate entity from the other Ellerman Lines, maintaining the red funnels with black tops of Thomas Wilson Sons & Co. with most of their vessels having very distinctive dark green hulls.Greenway, Ambrose (1986); A Century of North Sea Passenger Steamers ; Shepperton, Ian Allan Ltd. ; Page 48 ; By 1917, Ellerman owned 1.5 million tons of shipping, equivalent to the entire French merchant navy. Ellerman far surpassed his rivals in shipping; through his shrewd decision- making, assets flourished under his management. Other business interests At the same time Ellerman expanded his brewing interests and by 1918 he held shares in more than seventy breweries. In many cases he improved the financial performance of these businesses rapidly. From around 1904 he also invested in newspapers, owning stakes in the Financial Times, the Daily Mail, The Times, the Illustrated London News, Tatler, The Sphere and other publications at various times. He sold most of his press interests in the 1920s. Another field in which Ellerman was a major player was coal. In the 1920s he held shares in at least 22 collieries. After World War I he also became a major owner of property in London. Aristocrats such as the Duke of Bedford, Lord Howard de Walden and Earl Cadogan were increasingly selling off slices of the freehold West End estates which had been in their families for centuries and Ellerman was often the buyer. Personal life Ellerman had little interest in public recognition. He was created a baronet of Connaught Square in the Metropolitan Borough of Paddington on 11 December 1905 in appreciation of his contribution to British shipping needs during the Boer War, but he could readily have obtained a higher honour if he had wanted one. His lifestyle was unostentatious. In 1916 he stated that he was worth ¬£55 million (then US$275 million)(equivalent to ¬£ in ). This may well have been correct as he had no reputation for self-aggrandizement. The following year a journalist estimated that his shipping interests alone were worth ¬£35 million. At this time the Duke of Westminster was generally reckoned to be the second-richest man in the United Kingdom with a fortune of around ¬£14 million. When Ellerman died in 1933 his estate was assessed for probate in 1936 at ¬£36,684,994 13s. 5d. (roughly equivalent to ¬£ in ). The previous record was ¬£13.5 million left by Lord Iveagh of the Guinness Brewery in 1927. Ellerman had negotiated the Great Depression skillfully, but his wealth at death must have been well below its 1920s peak. Ellerman lived a secretive life in Mayfair and Eastbourne. Although he did purchase New Slains Castle in Scotland in 1916, he subsequently dismantled it & removed its roof to avoid roof tax, leaving it a ruin by 1925. He made no attempt to join high society or enter politics. One possible reason is that from the early 1890s he lived with a woman called Hannah Glover, and had a daughter by her in 1894, but did not marry her until 1908, the year before the birth of his only son, who was also called John Ellerman. Ellerman was appointed Companion of Honour (CH) in the 1921 New Year Honours. He was buried at Putney Vale Cemetery. Descendants Ellerman's daughter Annie Winifred Glover, later Annie Winifred Ellerman, was a published writer under the penname Bryher. Her autobiography, The Heart to Artemis (1963), gives an account of her father. On his death in July 1933, Ellerman left about ¬£900,000 to Bryer, but the majority of his wealth ‚Äì around ¬£20 million after death duties ‚Äì was inherited by his only son John.

The band reformed in 2014 and was led by Pipe Major George Shepherd and Drum Sergeant Olav Goud. The band ceased operations in 2016 following the decision of Pipe Bands Australia to terminate the band's membership following a protracted period of behaviour deemed unacceptable by the association History The City of Nunawading Pipe Band, as it was first known, was formed in 1956. The first Pipe Major was Bill Sutherland, hence the Sutherland tartan. The first Leading Drummer was Andrew Clark and Corporal Drummer John Hayden. In the late 1970s, and early 1980s, the Pipe Major was Brian Symington, the Drum Major was Robert Counsins (followed by D/M Geoff Bellis), and the leading drummer was Bill Russell.Brian Symington, 2014 Sir Rupert Hamer Award Recipient.Pipes and Drums: Brian's richly deserved piping award. Three decades of local competition saw the band venture to New Zealand in 1989, where they won the national championships in Grade 2. Under a year later, Nunawading also secured first place in Grade 2 of the Australian and South Pacific Pipe Band Championships (held in Brisbane, Queensland) which earned their promotion to Grade 1. After several years competing in this grade, the City of Nunawading Pipe Band took another overseas trip, this time to the World Pipe Band Championships in Glasgow, Scotland. In the home of the Great Highland Bagpipe, the Australian contenders placed 18th. While this was a commendable effort, the band went into decline for much of the remaining decade, until its resurgence in 2001 under the leadership of Danny and Alistair Boyle, pipe major and drum major, respectively. After this changeover, Nunawading climbed from Grade 3 to Grade 1 in the space of a single competition season. To fill the void left by the upgrading, and in order to make space for an influx of new members, a second band was created. Nunawading again travelled to New Zealand in 2003, and placed 2nd in Grade 1. The band subsequently attained 19th placing competing in Grade 1 in the 2005 world pipe band championships held in Glasgow, Scotland. Australia Highlanders Era For marketing reasons, in February 2006, the band's name was rebadged as Australia Highlanders Pipe Band. In August 2006, the band returned to Scotland to place 4th at the Bridge of Allan pipe band competition, as well as to again compete at the World Pipe Band Championships wherein the band qualified for the Grade 1 final for the first time, finishing 11th. With an overall win at the Australian and South Pacific Pipe Band Championships later in the year, it was seen that the exceptional performances the band was already known for could still be expected under its new name. The 50th Anniversary of the band remains its most successful year to date. In 2007 the band returned once more to Glasgow for the World Championships. Again, they qualified for the Grade 1 final and, this time, finished 13th. In 2016, five members of CoWPB were suspended by Pipe Bands Australia (PBA)Pipe Bands Australia [Retrieved 26 February 2017] for making a relatively innocuous but derogatory comment on the band's private Facebook page. The five members (including the Pipe Major and Drum Sergeant) subsequently resigned their membership of PBA prior to lodging an appeal. The band then resigned its membership of the PBA before accepting an offer to renew its membership/registration in order to be eligible to compete at the Australian Pipe Band Championships held on 2‚Äì3 October at Knox College, Sydney. However, at the 2016 Australian Championships, CoWPB was disqualified mid-way through the competition when \\"members of the public\\" assisted the band in the tuning- up area (it was obvious to spectators that other competing pipe bands also received assistance in tuning up from \\"members of the public\\" but were not penalised or disqualified). The band's membership of PBA was subsequently annulled and the band deregistered. This episode in Australian pipe band history, is unparalleled, with the PBA Executive punishing the many innocent and dedicated playing members of CoWPB for what can only be described as a relatively trivial, if ill-advised remark on the band's private Facebook page.

The character is based on the Greco-Roman god of the same name. Publication history Pluto first appeared in the pages of Thor #127 in 1966 where he was adapted by Stan Lee and drawn by Jack Kirby. Fictional character biography Pluto is the Olympian god of the Underworld, death, and the dead, and is the Monarch of Hades. Much of the character's story parallels that of traditional Greek Myth. To wit, after defeating their father Cronus, Pluto and his brothers Zeus and Neptune as well as his sisters Hera, Hestia and Demeter drew lots to divide Cronus' empire among them. Pluto gained control of the Underworld as the judge of the dead. However, in the Marvel Universe, Pluto is a scheming god that plans to overthrow Zeus, which no Greek Myth supports. His most infamous act is when he takes Zeus' and Demeter's daughter, his niece Persephone (also known as Kore) as his wife against her will. This event goes on to cause him some dismal failures in the future; for instance the Avengers once defeat him when Persephone issues an edict against him. He also became a major enemy of Hercules, when the young Hercules captures Pluto's dog Cerberus as one of his Twelve Labours. When worship of the Greek Gods dies out, Zeus forbids Pluto to take anymore souls into his underworld. He became bitter and begins a long history of plotting against his more powerful brother. After numerous failures, Zeus decrees that Pluto can only leave the Underworld if he finds someone willing to rule in his place. Pluto travels to Earth and disguises himself as Mr. Hellman, a film producer, and invites Hercules to make a film about himself. Hercules signs the contract into ruling the underworld unaware of that the contract actually binds him to serve as ruler of the Olympian Underworld in Pluto's place, as he believes the film is about him conquering the Netherworld by defeating Pluto. Thor learns of Pluto's deception and challenges him on Hercules' behalf. Pluto sends Thor into the Olympian Underworld where his goal is to defeat Pluto's minions. After witnessing Thor's remarkable progress which destroys much of the Underworld which Pluto has spent centuries building, Pluto becomes disgusted and destroys the contract, releasing Hercules.Thor #127-130 Pluto next invaded Earth with mutates from an alternate future. He clashed with Thor, and was thwarted by Zeus.Thor #163-164 Pluto attempts to invade both Olympus, home of the Greek Gods and Asgard, home of Thor and his fellow Asgardians on numerous occasions, each without success. Pluto forms an alliance with Ares, his nephew and Olympian God of War, and attempts to foment war between Olympus and Asgard, but is defeated in combat by Thor.Thor #221-222 Pluto eventually makes an alliance with other death gods and demons. He allies himself with Queen Hippolyte, Queen of the Amazons, and Ares, who also believes that Zeus refusal to force the humans to worship them is a mistake. However Hippolyte only wants Hercules to be hers and has no interest in Pluto's desire to be worshipped by humanity again. Pluto attempts to sponsor the divorce of Hercules and Hebe to marry Hercules to Hippolyte as well as Ares to marry Venus. According to Olympian law, Hercules and Venus are not allowed to fight their partners when Hippolyte and Ares assist Pluto in conquering Olympus. However, this plan was exposed by Ghost Rider, and ultimately fails as Zeus, after some hesitation at first, finally forbids the unions.Champions #1-4 Pluto later allied with Ulik and Loki against Thor.Thor #279 Pluto sought to create a \\"nether-hole\\" that would destroy the universe. He fought and defeated the Stranger, but was defeated by the Thing and the Hulk, whom the Stranger had brought with him.Marvel Two-in-One Annual #5 Pluto allied in a scheme with other death gods and demons. He was devoured by Demogorge, but released by Thor.Thor Annual #10 Pluto later held the Avengers prisoner in Tartarus at Zeus's behest, but the Avengers battled their way out and escaped.Avengers #282-283 To circumvent Zeus' decree, Pluto attempts to conquer Earth with the help of Lorelei. Pluto transforms Lorelei into a copy of the Valkyrie and drains her of her power and memories. He then uses the absorbed power to take control of the real Valkyrie to turn Earth into a realm of the dead itself. The Valkyrie's presence masks his own influence and Zeus' decree still allows Pluto to annex other realms of the dead. Pluto is eventually stopped by the Defenders who bring Lorelei along, thinking her to be their teammate. The clash of the two Valkyries releases Lorelei from the spell and together they turned on Pluto and ended his plan. With the disappearance of the Asgardians after Ragnar√∂k, Zeus fears for the continued existence of the Olympians as well and decides that they should mingle among humanity to hide from any force threatening them. Hades (Pluto) becomes a mafia-inspired crime lord, joking that he is still a lord of the underworld. The Olympians eventually return to Olympus, where they come under siege by the Japanese god Amatsu-Mikaboshi.Ares #1 The Olympus Group Hera and Pluto take over the Olympus Group, the modern day seat of power for the Olympians, through the shares inherited by Hera from Zeus and by buying out Poseidon. They declare the company has a new major goal: the deaths of Athena and Hercules.Incredible Hercules #123 Pluto appears with the Olympus Group when Norman Osborn's Avengers storm one of the Group's warehouses. There, Pluto grants Daken an unsolicited prophecy of the day, month, and gruesomeness of Daken's death. Daken attacks Pluto to little effect, and is in turn overwhelmed by Pluto's army of mafioso undead.Incredible Hercules #128 Hercules and Amadeus Cho enter Pluto's underworld, its new entrance being an Atlantic City casino where deceased heroes and villains can try betting their way into resurrection. There, they find Pluto has begun a trial with Zeus as the accused, ostensibly in the name of all his victims in Hades, with 501 deceased jurors holding court in a mockery of Athenian justice. Pluto hopes that removing Zeus will increase his own power within the pact made in prehistory among Pluto, Poseidon and Zeus to divide creation into their respective realms. He tries to prevent Hercules from interfering by offering him the soul of Hercules' adoptive father, who tells Hercules to rescue Zeus instead. Zeus is eventually found guilty, and submits to his sentence: he drinks from the Lethe river, erasing his memory, and is reborn on Earth as a child. With Zeus removed from their clutches, the dead turn against Pluto immediately, as he is now the sole accessible cause of their suffering.Incredible Hercules #129-131 Pluto subsequently reappears at Hercules' funeral, in the company of Athena (now the leader of the Olympians), Apollo, Poseidon, and Hebe.Hercules: Fall of an Avenger #1 During the Chaos War storyline, Pluto is seen arguing with Persephone when Hela appears telling him that the realms of the dead are being targeted by Amatsu-Mikaboshi. Pluto releases the souls of the dead, both blessed and damned, to fight for his realm, freeing Zeus, Hera, Ares, various mortal heroes (including Banshee, Swordsman I, and Yellowjacket II) and various mortal villains (including Abomination and Iron Monger).Chaos War #2 Powers and abilities Pluto is a member of the race of immortals known as the gods of Olympus. Among his race, his superhuman strength is equaled only by Neptune and Ares, and is exceeded only by Zeus and Hercules. Pluto's body is also virtually tireless, granting him almost limitless stamina. Pluto has proven capable of withstanding powerful impact forces, temperature extremes, and powerful energy blasts all without sustaining damage. Like all other members of his race, Pluto is immortal in the sense that he is immune to the effects of aging. He hasn't aged since reaching adulthood and is also immune to all known diseases. It would take damage that severely discorporated his body to cause his physical death. He is able to recover from damage with a greater speed and extent than most other members of his race. Pluto controls vast magical powers, equaled only by Neptune, and second only to Zeus amongst Olympians, and has faced Earth's Sorcerer Supreme, Doctor Strange, in direct magical combat.Defenders vol.2 #3-4 (2001) Pluto can generate powerful energy blasts; temporarily increase his physical attributes; bestow superhuman powers upon other beings or objects; manipulate time on a considerable scale, from simply accessing other eras (including alternate futures) or creating impenetrable time funnels; create highly durable force fields; create weapons of mystical flame, whose touch can paralyze and harm an opponent, even gods such as Hercules, and is capable of interdimensional teleportation.Thor #223 As a Death God, Pluto has a pact with Death that allows him to claim the souls of any worshipper of the Greco-Roman Gods, and order those under his command. He is capable of draining the energy and life-force from those that he touches, even other gods. The various Death Gods can either act as allies or competitors depending on the situation. Pluto is more powerful within Hades than in other realms, due to his ability to commune with and manipulate the energies of the Underworld. On Earth, he can command armies of undead. Although he typically prefers to use minions, Pluto is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, skilled in the use of battleaxes and swords made of the enchanted, virtually indestructible, \\"adamantine\\" (from which the fictional metal, adamantium, was named), and can use them to channel his powers. He wears Olympian battle armor made of the same material. Pluto possesses a helmet that renders him invisible and undetectable, even to fellow gods; he sometimes rides a mystical chariot capable of flight and travelling to other realms, and he has made occasional use of potent mystical items such as the Gem of Tartarus, which encased the four original Defenders within an enchanted pillar, though the Gem itself was fragile and swiftly shattered.

It stars Paul Newman as William F. Cody, alias Buffalo Bill, along with Geraldine Chaplin, Will Sampson, Joel Grey, Harvey Keitel and Burt Lancaster as Bill's biographer, Ned Buntline. It was filmed in Panavision by cinematographer Paul Lohmann. As in his earlier film M*A*S*H, Altman skewers an American historical myth of heroism, in this case the notion that noble white men fighting bloodthirsty savages won the West. However, the film was poorly received at the time of its release, as the country was celebrating its bicentennial. Plot The story begins in 1885 with the arrival of an important new guest star in Buffalo Bill Cody's grand illusion, Chief Sitting Bull of Little Big Horn fame. Much to Cody's annoyance, Sitting Bull proves not to be a murdering savage but a genuine embodiment of what the whites believe about their own history out west. He is quietly heroic and morally pure. Sitting Bull also refuses to portray Custer's Last Stand as a cowardly sneak attack. Instead, he asks Cody to act out the massacre of a peaceful Sioux village by marauding bluecoats. An enraged Cody fires him but is forced to relent when star attraction Annie Oakley takes Sitting Bull's side.

It follows the day to day performances and behind-the-scenes intrigues of Buffalo Bill Cody's famous \\"Wild West Show\\", a hugely popular 1880s entertainment spectacular that starred the former Indian fighter, scout and buffalo hunter. Altman uses the setting to criticize Old West motifs, presenting the eponymous western hero as a show-biz creation who can no longer separate his invented image from reality. Altman's Cody is a loud-mouthed buffoon, a man who claims to be one with the Wild West but lives in luxury, play-acting daily in a western circus of his own making. Cody's long hair is a wig, he can't shoot straight any more or track an Indian, and all his staged battles with ruffians and savages are rigged in his favor. However, this does not keep him from acting as if his triumphs are real, or plaguing his patient entourage of yes-men with endless monologues about himself. Most of the film was shot on location in Alberta, Canada, mostly on the Stoney Indian Reserve. Frank \\"Sitting Wind\\" Kaquitts, who played Sitting Bull, had been elected the first ever chief of Alberta's Nakoda (Stoney) First Nation, after three bands had amalgamated the year before.Warren Harbeck, One last mountain journey with Sitting Wind, Cochrane Eagle, November 27, 2002Sitting Wind , Rocky Mountain Nakoda Critical reception A preview showing in New York in May 1976 received a mixed reaction from the press.

Within five minutes, everything he has to say on the subject is apparent.\\" Among positive reviews, Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \\"It's a sometimes self-indulgent, confused, ambitious movie that is often very funny and always fascinating.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film a full four out of four stars, writing that while the film's ideas weren't anything special, \\"Altman's movies are innovative. They surprise us with their physical beauty, their wit, and their style.

(2013). Joan Lippincott: The Gift of Music. CreateSpace. . is an American concert organist and former head of the organ department at Westminster Choir College in Princeton, New Jersey. She was born Joan Edna Hult on December 25, 1935, the daughter of Edna and Frank Hult, in Kearny, New Jersey. Her early keyboard studies were with William Jancovius of Nutley, New Jersey. After attending Kearny High School, she entered Westminster Choir College, where she studied with the renowned Alexander McCurdy. Upon graduation from Westminster Choir College, she gained entrance to the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she was again the student of Alexander McCurdy as well as Vladimir Sokoloff. Following her Diploma from the Curtis Institute, she returned to Westminster Choir College to earn her master's degree. At the same time, she was hired by McCurdy to join the keyboard faculty at Westminster, starting what would become her 37-year tenure. On June 18, 1960, she married Curtis Lippincott in Bristol Chapel on the campus of Westminster Choir College. At the age of 31 in 1967, she became the head of the Organ Department at Westminster Choir College, the largest organ department in the world at the time, where she would teach hundreds of student organists over the years. In 1993 she accepted a position as the Principal Organist at Princeton University Chapel, with its freshly rebuilt instrument, while retaining her position at Westminster. Soon after, she realized that the demands of the Princeton position made it impossible for her to remain the Head of the Westminster Organ Department. From 1993 until 2000, she served as organist for Princeton University, playing services and accompanying Penna Rose's Chapel Choir as well as presenting frequent organ recitals in the Chapel. In 2000, Ms. Lippincott retired from the position as Princeton Organist to pursue her recital career. Westminster awarded her an honorary doctorate in 2001, and in 2017 she received the annual Distinguished Artist Award from the American Guild of Organists. She and her husband Curtis retired to Wellfleet, MA in 2008, where they had maintained a summer home for several years. Ms. Lippincott joined the Lilian Murtagh Concert Management roster in 1967. Karen McFarlane Holtkamp took over the management following Lilian‚Äôs death in 1976 and was President from 1976‚Äì2000; John McElliott succeeded her. Ms. Lippincott has performed over 600 concerts in over 40 years as one of the Karen McFarlane Artists, Inc. organists. Ms. Lippincott has been acclaimed as one of America‚Äôs outstanding organ virtuosos and she performs extensively in the United States and has toured throughout Europe and Canada. She has been a featured recitalist at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center in New York City, at the Spoleto Festival USA, at the American Bach Society Biennial, at the Dublin (Ireland) International Organ Festival, and at conventions of the American Guild of Organists, the Organ Historical Society, and the Music Teachers National Association. She has performed on many of the most-prominent organs in churches and universities throughout the United States, including Yale, Harvard, Duke, Stanford, Columbia, Notre Dame, and Princeton. She has traveled widely in Europe, studying and performing on historic and contemporary organs in the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, and France. Ms. Lippincott has been especially in demand for Bach recitals and classes. She was recitalist at the Alice Tully Hall Bach-Handel Tercentennial and she has performed at Bach Festivals in Arizona, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Oregon, and South Carolina. In 2001‚Äì2002 she performed a highly acclaimed series of eight Bach organ concerts on outstanding organs throughout New York City, called \\"Bach in the Big Apple\\". In 2008‚Äì2009 she performed The Art of Fugue at the Baldwin-Wallace Bach Festival, at Westminster‚Äôs Bach Week at Princeton Seminary, and at the Boston Early Music Festival. Throughout her recital career, Ms. Lippincott has also been recognized for her flair for the contemporary. She has premiered many significant contemporary organ works, as well as regularly including 20th-century literature on her recital programs. She has been heard in recital broadcasts of contemporary American music, such as ABC‚Äôs Pilgrimage series and The Musical Fund Society of Philadelphia‚Äôs presentation of contemporary American music. She played the American premiere of Malcolm Williamson‚Äôs Organ Symphony at the National Cathedral in Washington, DC; the American premiere of Iain Hamilton‚Äôs Paraphrase for Organ on Epitaph for This World and Time at the Riverside Church, New York City; and first performances of commissioned works: Epiphanies by Daniel Pinkham at House of Hope Presbyterian Church, St. Paul, MN; Masques d‚ÄôAfrique for Organ, Trumpet and Percussion by C. Curtis-Smith at the Air Force Academy, CO, at a national convention of The American Guild of Organists; and The Salutation of Gabriel for Organ and Horn by Daniel Pinkham at the Peabody Conservatory at a celebration honoring Karen McFarlane. In 1952, Ainslee Cox composed Prelude for Organ which he dedicated to Ms. Lippincott. Her repertoire is vast and includes performances of works for organ and orchestra such as the Poulenc Concerto for Organ, Strings and Timpani; Saint-Sa√´ns Organ Symphony; Barber Toccata Festiva; Jongen Symphonie Concertante; Dupr√© Po√®me H√©roique; Widor Salvum Fac Populum Tuum; Lockwood Concerto for Organ and Brass; Handel Concertos; Mozart Church Sonatas; and Bach Sinfonias. She has released nineteen CD recordings as well as six long- playing vinyls. Her first recording, released in 1980 on the Gothic label, was Toccatas and Fugues of J.S. Bach on the new Fisk organ at House of Hope Presbyterian Church in St. Paul, Minnesota. Her discography includes works of Bach, Durufl√©, Mozart, Mendelssohn, Widor, Alain, and Pinkham on major American organs. She is famous for her teachings of rhythm and touch in organ music, particularly that of Bach. Her playing is distinguished by rhythmic intensity, a supple technical control, and emotional intensity.  Partial discography  Gothic: * J.S. Bach: Toccatas and Fugues.

The type species, Laosaurus celer, was first described by O.C. Marsh in 1878 from remains from the Oxfordian-Tithonian-age Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of Wyoming. The validity of this genus is doubtful because it is based on fragmentary fossils. A second species from the Morrison Formation, L. gracilis, and a species from the late Cretaceous of Alberta, Laosaurus minimus, are also considered dubious. History and taxonomy Marsh (1878a) named his new genus from vertebrae (YPM 1874) found by Samuel Wendell Williston at Como Bluff, Wyoming, from rocks of the Morrison Formation. The type material includes nine partial and two complete tail vertebral centra, which he concluded came from a \\"fox-sized\\" animal. In the same year, he named two other species: L. gracilis, originally based on a back vertebral centrum, a tail vertebral centrum, and part of an ulna; and L. altus, originally based on a pelvis, hindlimb, and tooth (YPM 1876). A review by Peter Galton in 1983 found the type of L. gracilis to consist of thirteen back and eight tail centra, and portions of both hindlimbs. Charles Gilmore had assigned additional remains, including a partial skeleton (CM 11340), to L. gracilis based on size, but Galton transferred the remains to other taxa, assigning the skeleton to Dryosaurus. Marsh returned to the genus in 1894, when additional remains convinced him that L. altus deserved its own genus (Dryosaurus), and that there was another species present: L. consors, based on YPM 1882, a partial skeleton also from Como Bluff. In 1895, he coined the family Laosauridae for his genus, but this was eventually considered synonymous with Hypsilophodontidae. Othniel Charles Marsh's 1896 skeletal restoration of \\"Laosaurus\\" consors (now Nanosaurus). Charles Gilmore in 1909 assigned a juvenile femur (USNM 5808) to L. gracilis, and in 1925 added partial skeleton CM 11340 to L. gracilis, based on size, but Galton transferred the femur to Othnielia (now Nanosaurus) and the skeleton to Dryosaurus in 1983. Gilmore also described the fifth and final species, L. minimus (species name for its small size), based on NMC 9438, a partial left hindlimb and vertebral bits from the Late Cretaceous (late Campanian) Allison Formation of Alberta, Canada. At the time, though, the discovery locality was thought to be in the Early Cretaceous Blairmore Group, but fieldwork at the L. minimus type locality in the early 1930s showed it to be within the Belly River Group, and Loris Russell published a paper in 1949 recognizing this new geologic information, while finding it generically distinct from Laosaurus proper. Russell found this taxon to be most like Hypsilophodon, from the Early Cretaceous Wessex Formation of southern England. The next major publications which mentioned Laosaurus prominently were by Galton. In 1977, he assigned L. consors and L. gracilis to his new taxon Othnielia rex; and in 1983 he redescribed most of the material and reassigned some of it, as described above. Galton (1983) is also one of the sources for the \\"Troodon as carnivorous ornithopod\\" hypothesis of the early 1980s, because it assigns L. minimus to Troodon, based on unpublished evidence. This would tie in with the Orodromeus/Troodon egg confusion of a few years later, which was eventually settled as Troodon individuals eating Orodromeus individuals at their nesting site (the troodontid embryoes were confused with hypsilophodont embryoes). L. celer was assessed as dubious by Galton, a status it has kept through the last major reviews. Two further developments have occurred. First, L. minimus is seen as a possible second species or specimen of Orodromeus (Sues and Norman, 1990), although the remains are too meager to be certain. Second, Galton, in a 2007 review, declared Othnielia rex to be based on undiagnostic remains, and shifted diagnostic referred remains to new taxon Othnielosaurus consors, a new combination based on the original L. consors partial skeleton. Taxonomic summary *L. celer (type species) = dubious ornithischian *L. altus = Dryosaurus altus *L. consors = Othnielosaurus consors *L. gracilis = dubious ornithishian *L. minimus = dubious ornithischian, possibly the same as Orodromeus References External links *More on the taxonomy of Nanosaurus, Othnielia, and Laosaurus, from the Dinosaur Mailing List *First page and abstract of Russell, 1949 Category:Nomina dubia Category:Late Jurassic dinosaurs of North America Category:Late Cretaceous dinosaurs of North America Category:Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation Category:Taxa named by Othniel Charles Marsh Category:Fossil taxa described in 1878 Category:Paleontology in Wyoming Category:Paleontology in Alberta Category:Ornithischians ","title":"Laosaurus"},{"id":"4539445","text":"Lenore LaFount Romney (; November 9, 1908 ‚Äì July 7, 1998) was an American actress and political figure. The wife of businessman and politician George W. Romney, she was First Lady of Michigan from 1963 to 1969. She was the Republican Party nominee for the U.S. Senate in 1970 from Michigan. Her youngest son, Mitt Romney, is a U.S. Senator from Utah, a former Governor of Massachusetts and was the 2012 Republican presidential nominee. Lenore LaFount was born in Logan, Utah, and raised in Salt Lake City. She went to Latter-day Saints High School, where she developed an interest in drama and first met George Romney. She attended the University of Utah and George Washington University, graduating from the latter in 1929. She studied acting at the American Laboratory Theatre in New York, then went to Hollywood where she became a bit player who appeared in a number of films with Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer. Turning down a contract offer with them, she married George Romney in 1931. The couple had four children together; she was a stay-at-home mother, eventually living in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, while he became a success in business and politics. Lenore Romney was a popular First Lady of Michigan and was a frequent speaker at events and before civic groups. She was involved with many charitable, volunteer, and cultural organizations, including high positions with the Muscular Dystrophy Association, YWCA, and American Field Services, and also was active in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints of which she was a lifelong member. She was an asset to her husband's 1968 presidential campaign. Although a traditionalist, she was an advocate for the greater involvement of women in business and politics. In 1970, she was urged by her husband and state Republican Party officials to run against popular, two-term Democratic incumbent Senator Philip Hart. However, she struggled to establish herself as a serious candidate apart from her husband and failed to capture the support of conservatives within the party, only narrowly defeating State Senator Robert J. Huber in the party primary. Her difficulties continued in the general election and she lost to Hart by a two- to-one margin. She returned to volunteer activities during the 1970s, including stints on the boards of the National Center for Voluntary Action and the National Conference of Christians and Jews, and gave speeches to various organizations.  Early life and education  Lenore LaFount was born on November 9, 1908, in Logan, Utah, the second of four daughters of Alma Luella (n√©e Robison; 1882‚Äì1938) and Harold Arundel Lafount (1880‚Äì1952). Her father was born in Birmingham in England, and her mother, born in Montpelier, Idaho, was of colonial English ancestry (with more distant French roots). She had three sisters, one older and two younger. The family belonged to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; her father had converted to it in England and then came to the U.S., while her maternal grandmother, Rosetta Berry, had been one of the Mormon handcart pioneers.Mahoney, The Story of George Romney, p. 70. Her father worked as a headphone manufacturer while her mother was prominent in local charities.Harris, Romney's Way, p. 57. Lenore was raised in Salt Lake City, in a house located at Fifteenth South and Ninth East. She played the ukulele and was a member of the LDS girls club The Seagulls.Harris, Romney's Way, p. 54. She attended Latter-day Saints High School, where she had a strong interest in drama.Mahoney, The Story of George Romney, pp. 68, 71. In 1924, during her junior year, she and senior George W. Romney became high- school sweethearts.Harris, Romney's Way, p. 53. She was from a more assimilated Mormon family than his, which had struggled with financial failure and debt.Harris, Romney's Way, pp. 53‚Äì55. Although she was a \\"reach\\" for him in terms of social standing, he pursued her relentlessly from that point on, studying at a nearby junior college while she was a senior. She graduated from high school in 1926 after only three years and attended the University of Utah for two years, while George went to England and Scotland to serve as a Mormon missionaryMahoney, The Story of George Romney, p. 74. (making her \\"promise never to kiss anybody\\" while he was away). At the university, she was a member of the Chi Omega sorority. In 1927, she was one of six attractive young women chosen to welcome Charles Lindbergh to Salt Lake City following his historic Spirit of St. Louis flight, and she was featured on the front page of the Salt Lake Telegram as a result.Mahoney, The Story of George Romney, pp. 81‚Äì82. Later that year, on the strength of his friendship with U.S. Senator Reed Smoot, Harold Lafount was appointed by President Calvin Coolidge to serve on the new Federal Radio Commission. The family moved to Washington, D.C., and Lenore transferred to George Washington University, where she graduated with an A.B. degree in English literature in June 1929 after spending only three years total in college.Mahoney, The Story of George Romney, pp. 90, 103. George returned from his missionary stint and soon followed her to Washington.  Acting career  LaFount's mother wanted her to explore a theatrical career before marrying, and an aunt offered her further encouragement and assistance. LaFount thus moved to New York and enrolled in the American Laboratory Theatre to study acting, where she was taught Stanislavski's system under school co- founder Maria Ouspenskaya.Mahoney, The Story of George Romney, pp. 94‚Äì96. She found the experience inspiring. In student productions there, she starred in the Shakespearean roles of Ophelia and Portia and also appeared in roles from Ibsen and Chekhov plays. She received a performance award there in 1930. Talent scouts attending the productions were impressed, and she received an offer from the National Broadcasting Corporation to perform in a series of Shakespeare radio programs and from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to go to Hollywood under an apprentice actress contract. She decided on the latter, despite strenuous arguments against doing so from a threatened George, who had been visiting her on weekends. By then, he had a job with Alcoa, and arranged to be transferred to Los Angeles to be with her. In September 1930, the couple became engaged. A slender woman with porcelain skin and naturally curly chesnut colored hair, LaFount earned bit parts in Hollywood.Mahoney, The Story of George Romney, pp. 97‚Äì98. These included appearing as a fashionable young French woman in a Greta Garbo film and as an ingenue in the William Haines film A Tailor Made Man.Harris, Romney's Way, p. 67. She also appeared in films that starred Jean Harlow and Ramon Navarro and was a stand-in for Lili Damita. Her trained voice made her valuable during this dawn of the talking pictures era, and she worked as a voice actor in animated cartoons, sometimes doing the parts of speaking cats and dogs. She appeared in a promotional film clip with Buster, MGM's star dog.Kranish; Helman, The Real Romney, pp. 12‚Äì13. George's long-time jealousy about her being in contact with other men became even worse as she met stars like Clark Gable, and in reaction to his attempts to control her, she threatened to break off their engagement. After a few months in Hollywood, she had the opportunity to sign a three-year contract with MGM that was worth $50,000 if all the options were picked up. However, she was dismayed by some of the seamier aspects of Hollywood, including the studio's request that she pose for cheesecake photos and the constant gambling among the extras. She also found the long waits between shots unsatisfying as a thespian, and read Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky novels on the set to pass the time. Romney finally convinced her to go ahead with marriage and return to Washington, where he worked for Alcoa as a lobbyist,Current Biography Yearbook 1958, p. 367. earning $125 a month. Although Lenore had been more independent than many women of the time, she later stated that she \\"never had any regrets about giving up movies.\\" Another time she said that she had never had a choice of both marriage and an acting career: \\"In an acting career, I would have been upstaging him, and he couldn't stand that. It was never either and; it was always either or.\\"Harris, Romney's Way, p. 68. George would later consider his successful seven-year courtship of her to be his greatest sales achievement.  Marriage and family  Lenore LaFount married George Romney on July 2, 1931, at the Salt Lake Temple. Their wedding reception in the Chi Omega house at the University of Utah was attended by about four hundred guests. In Washington, Lenore's cultural refinement and hosting skills, along with her father's social and political connections, helped George in his business career, and the couple met the Hoovers, the Roosevelts, and other prominent Washington figures.Mahoney, The Story of George Romney, pp. 102‚Äì105. George often called upon her to host short-notice parties. During 1933‚Äì1934, Lenore hosted a 15-minute weekly program, Poetical Hitchhiking, on Washington's famed radio station WRC where she selected and read the poems. (The staff announcer who introduced her was Arthur Godfrey.) She also directed student plays at George Washington University. The couple's first child, Margo Lynn (known as Lynn) was born in 1935 after a difficult childbirth,Harris, Romney's Way, pp. 187‚Äì189. and Lenore became a stay-at-home mother. A second daughter, Jane, followed in 1938. In 1939, the family moved to the Detroit, Michigan, area when George took a job with the Automobile Manufacturers Association.Mahoney, The Story of George Romney, p. 109. They rented a house in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, for two years, then bought one in the Palmer Woods section of Detroit. The couple's first son, George Scott (known as G. Scott), was born in 1941. The couple longed for another child, but doctors told them that Lenore probably could not become pregnant again and might not survive if she did. By 1946, they had begun the process of adopting a war orphan living in Switzerland. However, Lenore became pregnant, and after a difficult pregnancy ‚Äì lying still on her back for a month in a hospital during one stretch ‚Äì and delivery, Willard Mitt (known as Mitt) was born in 1947.Mahoney, The Story of George Romney, pp. 104, 113.Kranish; Helman, The Real Romney, pp. 11‚Äì12, 14. After the birth she required a hysterectomy. Lenore would subsequently refer to Mitt as her miracle baby. The family moved to affluent Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, around 1953. In 1953, Lenore suffered another health crisis when a blood transfusion of the wrong type put her life in danger, but she recovered.Mahoney, The Story of George Romney, pp. 166‚Äì167. In 1954, George was named president and chairman of American Motors Corporation. During this time a bad attack of bursitis left her with no movement in her left arm for five years, and the rest of the family took up her chores.Harris, Romney's Way, pp. 191‚Äì193. The couple spent summers at a cottage on the Canadian shore of Lake Huron. A slipped disk suffered there gave her further trouble, and that and the bursitis caused her to switch from golf to swimming as her main exercise. The couple's marriage reflected aspects of their personalities and courtship. George was devoted to Lenore, and tried to bring her a flower every day, often a single rose with a love note.Kranish; Helman, The Real Romney, pp. 18‚Äì19. George was also a strong, blunt personality used to winning arguments by force of will, but the more self-controlled Lenore was unintimidated and willing to push back against him. The couple quarreled often, so much that their grandchildren would later nickname them \\"the Bickersons\\". In the end, their closeness would allow them to settle arguments amicably, often by her finally accepting what he wanted. She still had a restive nature; Mitt later recalled that, \\"It always seemed that she wanted something a little more for herself.\\"Scott, Mitt Romney, p.10. (Mitt himself would later show a more reserved, private, and controlled nature than George's, traits he got from Lenore.)  First Lady of Michigan  When her husband decided to enter electoral politics by running for Governor of Michigan in 1962, Lenore Romney said she and the family supported him: \\"I know it will be difficult ‚Äì not easy. But we're all dedicated with him for better government.\\" She played a productive role in the 1962 campaign, making speeches before groups of Republican women at a time when it was unusual for women to campaign separately from their husbands. She was given the task of campaigning in the rural and small urban, Republican-leaning outstate areas while he focused on the Democratic-leaning Detroit area.Harris, Romney's Way, p. 234. Following George's victory in November 1962, Lenore became the state's First Lady. About her new role, she said her goal was to make \\"a real breakthrough in human relations by bringing people together as people ‚Äì just like George has enunciated. Women have a very interesting role in this, and I don't expect to be a society leader holding a series of meaningless teas.\\" Lenore with her husband George (far left) and West Germany's Gerhard Stoltenberg (center) in 1967 She proved popular as a First Lady. She was a frequent speaker at events and before civic groups and became known for her eloquence. She was thus useful to his political career, just as she had been to his business one. Like her husband, she did not make public appearances on Sundays. He was re-elected in 1964 and 1966, and she campaigned frequently with him. Moreover, she played more of an active and partisan role within her party than any other Michigan first lady in the 20th century. She knew his policy positions at least as well as any of his official aides, went with him on almost all of his out-of-state trips, and gave his speeches for him if sudden events made him unable to attend.Harris, Romney's Way, pp. 52‚Äì53. Over time an impression grew among some in the public that she was smarter than he was. George Romney biographer T. George Harris concluded in 1967 that \\"she has been considerably more than a first lady.\\" Lenore was a traditionalist who decried the women's liberation movement as being one of \\"strident voices\\" and \\"burning bras and railing against male-chauvinistic pigs.\\" She decried relaxed sexual mores and talk of a \\"New Morality\\", saying \\"the morality they discuss is the barnyard morality and it is as old as the hills.\\" However, she was also an advocate for the involvement of women in business and politics. By 1966, she was telling audiences around the state, \\"Why should women have any less say than men about the great decisions facing our nation?\\" She added that women \\"represent a reservoir of public service which has hardly been tapped.\\" She explicitly criticized the counterculture phrase \\"Turn on, tune in, drop out\\", saying \\"What kind of a philosophy is that?\\" Instead she urged young people to \\"Think of something outside of yourselves. Have something in yourself that is greater than self.\\" She told one high school audience, \\"You have the right to rebel, but make sure what you're rebelling for is greater than what you're rebelling against.\\" She was a devout and faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who taught Sunday School lessons at her church for many years, including a stint during the early 1960s teaching 14-year-olds. Her views on many social issues were more liberal than most of the Republican Party, and she appeared on stage with Martin Luther King, Jr. at Michigan State University in March 1966. On the issue of the LDS Church policy of the time that did not allow black people in its lay clergy, she defended the church, saying, \\"If my church taught me anything other than that the Negro is equal to any other person, I could not accept it.\\" She was a member of the Women's City Club in Detroit, but in 1967, said she would resign unless the club dropped a policy barring black guests from eating in its dining room. During her husband's 1968 presidential campaign, Lenore continued to exert a calming influence on him and helped keep his sometimes problematic temper in check. She was adept at campaigning, appearing at ease and speaking in a lively, fluent manner without notes before audiences of various types. The Associated Press wrote that she was probably \\"the most indefatigable campaigner on the New Hampshire primary circuit, including the candidates\\". The New York Times wrote, \\"To see Mrs. George Romney in action is to watch an authentic, stand-up evangelist weave a spell. ... in the view of seasoned politicians, Lenore Romney is a far more effective speaker than the wife of any national candidate in recent memory. She may even be among the select group of political wives who win votes for their husbands through their own speeches and contacts.\\" As the campaign went on, George fell far behind Republican rival Richard Nixon in polls and withdrew in February 1968 before the first primaries took place. Lenore continued to have health difficulties, visiting medical centers around the country but unable to get a clear diagnosis. One specialist attributed her problems to a failure to absorb sufficient calcium, for which she was given once-a-week shots. She was found to have several food allergies and spent time at Chicago's Swedish Covenant Hospital in 1967. She suffered an injury outside her house around 1967 and another the next year when she fell and suffered a shoulder dislocation that turned into bursitis. During October 1968 she was hospitalized at Barnes- Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, seeing a bone and mineral specialist. Lenore Romney worked on behalf of many volunteer organizations over a number of years. In 1963, she was co-chair of the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Starting in 1965, she was a member of a special committee of the American Mothers Committee. By 1970, she was on the national board of directors of the YWCA and a member of the national advisory board to American Field Services. She had also held high positions with Goodwill Industries, United Community Services, Child Guidance Study, Association for Retarded Children, Michigan Association for Emotionally Disturbed Children, and the Michigan Historical Society. She worked with Project HOPE. She was chair of the Detroit Grand Opera Association and was active with the Women's Association for the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. The Boston Globe later characterized her as a \\"pillar of Detroit society\\".  1970 U.S. Senate campaign  Secretary of Housing and Urban Development on January 22, 1969, with President Richard Nixon|Lenore Romney with George Romney and Richard Nixon, January 22, 1969 1970 campaign button, illustrating the use of just the name \\"Lenore\\" in her campaign material After the 1968 presidential election, George Romney was named the U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the administration of the newly elected President Nixon. Lenore was not enthusiastic about leaving Michigan to return to Washington after three decades away, but said, \\"Any wife wants to be with her husband wherever he is, whether state or federal government, just so he can develop his creative ideas.\\" By then, the couple had 12 grandchildren. For the 1970 U.S. Senate election from Michigan, state Republicans were looking for someone to run against Democrat Philip Hart, a two-term incumbent. Hart was heavily favored to win re-election, but Republicans thought he might be vulnerable on ideological grounds (for being too liberal) and owing to an anti-war protest arrest involving his wife. George Romney's name was mentioned as a possible candidate. Indeed, Nixon, who never had good relations with Romney either personally or on policy grounds, had by then decided he wanted Romney out of his administration but did not want to fire him, and hatched a plot to get Romney to run in the Senate race.Kranish; Helman, The Real Romney, pp. 93‚Äì95.Kotlowski, Nixon's Civil Rights, p. 53. However, George came up with the idea of Lenore running, and sprung it on Lenore and the children at the end of 1969. Lenore's name began being mentioned by other Republicans, even though she professed not to want to run unless no other candidate could be found. U.S. House Minority Leader Gerald Ford from Michigan thought she could unite the state party's different factions, but Governor William Milliken, who had succeeded George and was not eager to see more Romneys in power, opposed the notion. And while Lenore had achieved a good reputation for campaigning on her husband's behalf, there were some who suspected that her Senate candidacy was just a stalking horse for keeping George's options open. Such sentiments were exacerbated when George did not completely rule himself out of a possible race. The state party had a system wherein there would be a series of meetings of its 355 leaders in order to declare a \\"consensus\\" candidate that the party would support in any primary election. During the initial February 21, 1970, meeting, Lenore Romney faced opposition from liberal U.S. Representative Donald W. Riegle, Jr. and conservative State Senator Robert J. Huber. The meeting became contentious, and with Milliken helping to block her, in three ballots she was unable to reach the three-fourths majority needed for the consensus nod. On February 23, she formally entered the contest for the Republican nomination for the Senate seat. George successfully pressured Milliken to endorse her, but gained bad publicity when The Detroit News exposed his actions. At the next party meeting, on March 7, she won 92 percent of the leaders and gained the consensus candidate position, and talk of George running ended. Riegle did not continue his run, but Huber did. In the ensuing primary contest, Romney's effort emphasized her sex, saying as a campaign theme, \\"Never before has the voice and understanding of a concerned woman been more needed.\\" Billboards featuring her face were everywhere, captioned only as \\"Lenore\\" and omitting any reference to political party. She was still photogenic, but so thin that she was sometimes described as \\"frail\\" or \\"waiflike\\", and her husband sometimes worried about her weight. She issued a half-hour campaign film that featured endorsements from many national and state party leaders as well as from celebrities Bob Hope and Art Linkletter, and showcased her family role and her concern for disadvantaged people. Huber, in contrast, emphasized his edge in political experience, derided her \\"motherly concern\\", and criticized the \\"bossism\\" that he said was trying to force another Romney into statewide office. Regarding the Vietnam War, Romney called for the withdrawal of all American troops by the end of 1971, and characterized the war as \\"disastrous\\". She was troubled by the ongoing Cambodian Incursion and said that if elected she would vote to cut off its funds if Nixon did not abide by his pledge to withdraw from there by the end of the month. On other issues, she sometimes took overly broad stances that appeared to come down on multiple sides. The conservative wing of the party, which had never trusted her husband, had the same reaction to her. The largely male press corps tended to deal with her in a paternalistic way, and she was often identified as \\"Mrs. George Romney\\" in stories and photo captions. Initially heavily favored over Huber, her campaign failed to gain momentum and polls showed a close race; in response, she shifted her ads to focus more on her stands on issues. In the August 4, 1970, primary, Lenore Romney won a narrow victory, with 52 percent of the vote compared to Huber's 48 percent. In the general election, with lost prestige, a divided party, and with her campaign resources partly drained by the primary fight, Romney was behind incumbent Democrat Hart from the beginning. Romney issued position papers and emphasized the themes of dealing with crime and social permissiveness; she also advocated a national healthcare plan and increased attention to environmental damage caused by industry. She never made any personal attacks against Hart. The only woman running for the U.S. Senate that year, she was a tireless campaigner, traveling around the state in a chartered Cessna and making as many as twelve stops a day. Nevertheless, the perception grew that she did not have any vision for what she would do as a senator and was only in the race because she was George Romney's wife. In response, she said at one point, \\"I'm not a stand-in or a substitute for anyone\\". Her campaign material continued to just refer to \\"Lenore\\". She also was negatively impacted, in both the primary and general election, by fallout from her husband's effort as HUD Secretary to enforce housing integration in Warren, Michigan. Consistently far ahead in polls, Hart staged a low-key campaign with few public appearances; he mostly ignored her and sometimes acted condescendingly towards her in private. The Romney children campaigned for her, including Mitt, who took student leave to work as a driver and advance man at schools and county fairs during the summer. Together, Lenore and Mitt visited all 83 Michigan counties. George was in Washington most of the time and did not publicly campaign for her until the campaign's final day. In the November 3, 1970, general election, Hart handily won a third term with 67 percent of the vote to her 33 percent. Romney made an unusual election- night visit to congratulate Hart in person, and in saying \\"I hope all good things will be his,\\" gave what the victor termed \\"the most graceful and really moving concession speech I've ever heard.\\" The campaign and loss left Lenore in emotional pain. In her election night remarks she had said, \\"I thought [running as a woman] would be an asset. It was disappointing to find that many people closed their minds just because I was a woman.\\" She expounded on this in an article she published the following year in Look magazine, describing the openly dismissive reaction she had gotten from both men and women. She wrote that, \\"In factories, I encountered men in small groups, laughing, shouting, 'Get in the kitchen. George needs you there. What do you know about politics?'\\" To a friend she wrote, \\"[I had no idea] how open and bare and wide my own vulnerability would be ... the body wounds are deep.\\" She told one of her children that she wished she had not run, and concluded that \\"It's the most humiliating thing I know of to run for office.\\"  Later years  George and Lenore Romney in the Cabinet Room at the White House in July 1969, along with son Mitt and daughter-in-law Ann Romney Following the campaign, Lenore Romney returned to Washington and to being a cabinet wife. George, who had also long been interested in volunteerism, had helped found the National Center for Voluntary Action in 1970, and Lenore was made a member of its executive committee. By late 1971, she assumed some of First Lady Pat Nixon's role as a public advocate for volunteerism, visiting regional volunteer centers with other cabinet and administration wives. She was on the board of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, serving as brotherhood chair during 1970‚Äì1971 and as vice chair in 1972. She was also a main force behind the Urban Service Corps, which sought to apply volunteer efforts to the problems of large cities. She worked with the National Women's Political Caucus to promote the electoral candidacies of women, and gave some speeches at colleges. She came out as explicitly anti-abortion. (Abortion was illegal in Michigan in this pre-Roe v. Wade era, and she had previously been ambivalent about expanding legal access to it; in any case, it had not been an issue in the 1970 Senate campaign.Kranish; Helman, The Real Romney, pp. 183‚Äì184.) In the 1972 U.S. presidential election, Lenore Romney worked in the women's surrogate program for the Committee for the Re-Election of the President. Nevertheless, her husband's relationship with Nixon and the administration became even worse and, in August 1972, she wrote a fruitless letter to presidential aide John Ehrlichman urging a change in the \\"low regard\\" and poor treatment that the administration showed him. After George Romney left the administration and politics in January 1973, Lenore continued with volunteerism, as vice president of the National Center for Voluntary Action. Correction filed: \\"Sorry, Our Error\\" January 18, 1973, p. C3. In 1974, she became a commentator on the WJR radio show Point of View. Subsequently, she receded from the public political eye, but still remained active. She gave speeches to various local religious and civic organizations in the Midwest, focusing on her faith, the potential of \\"people power\\", and the role of women. At age 85, Lenore Romney emerged to give interviews during her son Mitt's 1994 campaign for the U.S. Senate seat from Massachusetts. She contrasted Mitt to his opponent, long-time incumbent Senator Ted Kennedy; while Kennedy had been much in the news for his drinking and sexual escapades, Lenore noted that Mitt and wife Ann Romney had waited until marriage to have sex. Mitt lost the race to Kennedy. On July 26, 1995, George Romney died of a heart attack at the age of 88 while he was exercising on his treadmill at the couple's home in Bloomfield Hills; he was discovered by Lenore (after she went looking for him, not having found her rose for the day), but it was too late to save him.Kranish; Helman, The Real Romney, pp. 197‚Äì198. They had been married for 64 years, and the press noted the strength of that marriage. Lenore's health declined during her final years. But she was still doing fairly well when, at the age of 89, she suffered a stroke at her Bloomfield Hills home. She died several days later at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan, on July 7, 1998. Besides her four children, she was survived by 24 grandchildren and 41 great-grandchildren. She is interred in Fairview Cemetery in Brighton, Michigan, in the same family plot as her husband. Following her death, many state political figures paid tribute to her, including Governor John Engler and his wife Michelle, who called her \\"Michigan's rose\\", and Lieutenant Governor Connie Binsfeld, who characterized her as a \\"beloved role model for our state\\".  Awards and honors  In 1969, Lenore Romney received the Woman of the Year Award from Brigham Young University. She was named one of the National Top Ten Women News Makers for 1970. She was given the Salvation Army's Humanitarian Award, Michigan State University's Distinguished Citizen Award, and also received recognition from Hadassah and the International Platform Association. For many years beginning in 1987, the successor organizations to the National Center for Voluntary Action (VOLUNTEER: The National Center, National Volunteer Center, Points of Light Foundation, and Points of Light Foundation & the National Network of Volunteer Centers) have given out an annual Lenore and George W. Romney Citizen Volunteer Award (later retitled the George and Lenore Romney Citizen Volunteer Award). Lenore Romney was awarded six honorary degrees. She received an L.H.D. from Hillsdale College in 1964, from Hope College in 1967, and from Gwynedd‚ÄìMercy College in 1971.Who's Who of American Women, p. 761. She received an LL.D. from Central Michigan University in 1966. She received a Doctor of Humanities degree from Eastern Michigan University in 1968 and from Detroit College of Business in 1970.

Honda introduced the similar CB1100 in 2010.  History  In 1979 Honda produced a double overhead cam (DOHC) 750 cc engine developing 72 bhp @ 9000 rpm which was used in the CB750F model in the USA from 1979 to 1982. The same year Honda also released the CB900F using a race-bred 901 cc DOHC engine that was a step above the CB750 with its longer stroke and hotter cams squeezing out 95 bhp @ 8500 rpm (actual rear-wheel horsepower exceeded 80 horsepower as measured on a dynamometer). The CB900F was only offered in the USA from 1980 to 1982. In 1983 Honda released the CB1100F, based on the CB900F and the CB1100R. Besides a distinctive-to-the-1100f paint scheme, it used hotter cams, larger pistons, better carburetion in the form of four Keihin 34 mm CV, and a redesigned combustion chamber. The CB1100F produced 108 bhp @ 8500 rpm. It also had increased rake and the dash featured a 150 mph or 240 km/h speedometer and adjustable two-piece handlebars. The tubeless-tire wheels were new also, 18-inch x 2.50-inch front and 17-inch x 3-inch rear. Performance was pace setting. Cycle World tests at 11.13 seconds/120.48 mph quarter mile and 141 mph half mile earned it the designation of \\"fastest stock bike ever tested\\".Cycle World, January 1983 The CB1100F was available in different markets, such as USA, Canada, Europe, and Australia from 1982 through 1984. In the USA, a quarter-fairing for wind deflection (and looks), and cast single piece wheels were offered. The other markets had not the fairing, and the wheels were gold \\"boomerang\\" Comstars, similar to the ones on the Honda CB1100R, and the control cables were routed above, rather than below, the handlebars. The riding position was more sporty than the US model, with rearset footpegs and controls as well as lower two-piece clip-on handlebars. These different parts were originally offered through US dealers as a complete sport, or \\"continental\\" kit, and now command a price premium in the US as owners seek to upgrade their machines.  2010 CB1100  2014 CB1100 at the Seattle International Motorcycle Show In 2007, Honda showed two new concepts: the CB1100R and the CB1100F. Both were highly reminiscent of the original CB1100F/R, even sporting dual rear shocks with remote fluid reservoirs. Honda showed a revised concept at the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show called the CB1100.Tokyo 2009: Honda CB1100 brings back the UJM It was shown in two variants. One being more standard while the other more 'cafe-racer' style (black exhaust, black fender, bikini fairing, tapered rear seat). In 2013, Honda began selling the air-cooled CB1100 in the US.http://thekneeslider.com/honda-brings-back-the- past-with-the-2013-cb1100-a-cb750-all-grown-up/  References  CB1100F Category:Standard motorcycles Category:Motorcycles introduced in 1983 ","title":"Honda CB1100F"},{"id":"4539490","title":"Steve Bernier"},{"id":"4539502","text":"The Tigre people ( tigre or tigrƒì) are an ethnic group indigenous to Eritrea. They mainly inhabit the lowlands of Eritrea, Sudanese states of Kassala and Red Sea. History The Tigre are a nomadic pastoralist community living in the northern, western, and coastal highlands of Eritrea (Gash-Barka, Anseba, Northern Red Sea regions of Eritrea and other regions too), as well as areas in eastern Sudan. The Tigre speak the Tigre language, which belongs to the Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic family. They are not ethnically homogeneous; diversity is mainly along familial and clan lines. The Tigre ethnic group is broken into the Beni-Amer, Beit Asgede, Ad Shaikh, Mensa, Beit Juk, and Marya peoples. The original speakers of the Tigre language were mainly Christian, reflecting cultural exchange with neighboring Ethiopia. The first Tigre converts to Islam were those who lived on islands in the Red Sea and adopted Islam in the 7th century during the religion's earliest years. Mainland Tigre adopted Islam much later on including as late as the 19th century. During World War II, many Tigre served in the Italian Colonial army, part of the period of Italian Eritrea. The Tigre are closely related to the Tigrayans of Eritrea, as well as the Beja (particularly the Hadendoa). There are also a number of Eritreans of Tigre origin living across the Middle East, North America, the United Kingdom and Australia. Religion About 95% of Tigre practice Islam, the remainder practice Christianity, and both incorporate elements of the animist folk religion. Religious divisions have not been of particular concern within the Tigre. Most are Sunni Muslims, but there are a small number of Christians (who are members of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Eritrea) among them as well (often referred to as the Mensa√Ø in Eritrea). Language The Tigre language is an Afroasiatic language of the Semitic branch. Like Tigrinya, it is a member of the Ethiopian Semitic group, and is similar to ancient Ge'ez. There is no known historically written form of the language. The Eritrean government uses the Ge'ez writing system (an abugida) to publish documents in the Tigre language. Tigre is the lingua franca of the multi-ethnic lowlands of western and northern Eritrea, including the northern coast. As such approximately 75% of the Western Lowlands Eritrean population speaks Tigre. Since around 1889, the Ge'ez script (Ethiopic script) has been used to write the Tigre language. Tigre speakers formerly used Arabic more widely as a lingua franca. Due to most Tigre speakers being Muslim, the language is also written in the Arabic alphabet. The Tigre people, language and their area of inhabitation should not be confused with that of the Tigrayans, who live in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia and speak Tigrinya, a closely related Semitic language.

Summary Traditionally Lierskogen has been a place dependent on farming, but after World War II many new families have moved in. There are still dairy farms in the area, however non-agriculture work is scarce. Most resident have mostly been working in nearby places like B√¶rum, Asker, Dikemark, Drammen and Oslo. The old village centre was situated near Lierskogen Church (Lierskogen kirke). The church dates from 1937. The edifice is masonry and seats 150. Around it was the several businesses: Gravdal bakery, Heia children school (for children aged 7‚Äì12), a post-office and a petrol station. In 1985 Lierskogen had a population of only 800 people. But it was around this time a great building boom began. During the second half of the 1980s two major projects was built from scratch: Liertoppen, a shopping centre and pharmaceutical company Norsk Medisinaldepot. In 1987 Liertoppen was opened with two separate buildings and a large car park. An underground car park was also built under one of the buildings. In 1989 the two buildings was connected together with a bridge and then forming Norway's longest indoor shopping lane. In the 1990s the major building project was of several dozens new houses right behind Heia children school in the old village centre. Even though this settlement and several smaller ones has tripled the population to 2,300 people, the commercial centre of Lierskogen has moved 1.5 km away, up to the Liertoppen shopping centre. Due to the close distance to other growing places like Drammen, B√¶rum, Asker and Oslo, Lierskogen has continued to grow.

Description and history The Kingsley Covered Bridge is located west of Vermont Route 103 and just under the landing strip for the Rutland Airport on East Street Extension off Gorge Road, a paved road that turns to dirt after crossing the bridge. It is adjacent to the Kingsley Grist Mill Historic District, consisting of a restored mill and houses. The bridge has a 3-ton weight limit. The bridge is a single-span Town lattice truss structure, long and wide, with a roadway width of (one lane). The trusses rest on abutments that have been faced in concrete. The exterior is finished in vertical board siding, which extends from the sides, around the portals, and just inside the portals. It has a roof of corrugated metal. The bridge bears a sign claiming to have been built in 1836, but the National Register nomination claims a construction date of about 1870. The bridge was built by Timothy K. Horton (1814-1896), and is the town's last surviving 19th-century bridge. The site has apparently had a bridge since the late 18th century, with references to a crossing being authorized there in 1788.

History The company was founded in 2001 by industry veteran Dion Giarrusso and his half-brother David Joseph, who co-owned the company. Giarrusso had previously worked as general manager of Elegant Angel, whilst Joseph was new to the industry. Giarrusso established the Red Light brand by using his existing industry contacts, and launching an aggressive marketing campaign. Film production was overseen by performer and director Vince Vouyer, who had previously been an exclusive director at Anabolic Video. The plan was to emulate Evil Angel's setup where producers/directors would own their own movies, and share in the profits. Other initial directors included Michael Stefano, John Strong and Mark Wood. The company strove to produce hardcore gonzo pornography with higher production values than much of the gonzo of the time, and filmed in luxurious mansions rather than hotel rooms. The studio's first film was 110% Natural, which was released on November 1, 2001. Initially Red Light released one film a week, and produced more than 50 films in its first year. In 2003 Platinum X Pictures was launched by Michael Stefano and Jewel De'Nyle (who would later marry), bankrolled by Giarrusso and Red Light. Platinum X featured directors Manuel Ferrara, Brandon Iron and Steve Holmes, and produced very similar content to Red Light. Around the same time Red Light began distributing the films of Amateur District and Candy Shop, a studio headed by Stefano that specialized in interracial content. De'Nyle left Platinum X in June 2006. Vouyer and Giarrusso eventually brought over many of Vince's colleagues from Anabolic in 2004. Erik Everhard, Lexington Steele, and Mike John joined RLD, where they could start their own production companies to be distributed by the RLD infrastructure. Steele's stay was brief, as he left to start his own studio, Mercenary Pictures, after only a few releases at Red Light. In 2004 Giarrusso left the company. Joseph bought out his share and took over the reins, slowly shifting from a business model based on producer/director ownership, to a model where he owned more and more titles, and could profit accordingly. He, for all intents and purposes, merged RLD and PXP, 'promoting' Stefano and Ferrara to RLD. After negotiations with Rick Salomon, Joseph was able to get rights to 2004's massive hit movie, 1 Night in Paris, starring Paris Hilton. Salomon had initially been distributing the tape himself, following a legal battle with the Hilton family, and he and Red Light agreed to pay Hilton $400,000 plus a percentage of the tape's sales. However, in a 2006 interview with GQ magazine, Hilton stated: \\"I never received a dime from (the video). It's just dirty money and (Salomon) should give it all to some charity for the sexually abused or something.\\" The film went on to be the top- selling and renting porn film of 2005, and Joseph claims it is one of the top- selling pornographic films of all time. The success of 1 Night in Paris and the media attention it aroused was a huge publicity boost for the company. Other celebrity sex tapes followed; the same year Red Light released 1 Night in China, starring Sean Waltman and WWE wrestler Joanie Laurer,Ogunnaike, L. (2006). \\"Sex, Lawsuits and Celebrities Caught on Tape\\" The New York Times.

In early 2006, several of the RLD directors decided they weren't getting a fair share, and announced they were leaving. Erik Everhard and Ferrara joined Evil Angel. Everhard sued Red Light for breach of contract, conversion, claim and delivery and accounting, and was awarded $141,000 in damages. Mike John joined Jules Jordan's new company Jules Jordan Video, and Vince Vouyer left to start Vouyer Media, to be distributed by Wicked Pictures. In January 2006, Giarrusso launched his new production company Combat Zone. In November, 2006, Elegant Angel announced that it would distribute its videos in Europe exclusively through Red Light District, however in April 2007, Elegant Angel instead launched its own European division, Elegant Angel Europe. In 2007 RL sold its sister companies Platinum X Pictures, Amateur District and The Candy Shop. It also settled a lawsuit over a sex tape that was filmed on Kid Rock's tour bus. In May 2007 the studio stopped handling its own distribution when it signed an exclusive deal with Pulse Distribution. RLD currently releases two new titles per week. It distributes its content via DVDs, video on demand and satellite television. Red Light films can also be downloaded to iPods and mobile phones. Directors Current Red Light directors include Mark Wood, Michael Stefano and Mr. Pete.

It is a designated entry and exit point in and out of the country. Location It is north-west of the central business district of Gulu, the largest metropolitan area in the Northern Region. The airport is approximately , by air, north of Entebbe International Airport, Uganda's largest civilian and military airport. The geographical coordinates of Gulu Airport are: 02¬∞47'58.0\\"N, 32¬∞16'31.0\\"E (Latitude:2.799444; 32.275278). The airport sits at an elevation of above mean sea level. Overview The airport serves the city of Gulu, with an estimated population of 177,400 in 2020. It is one of the twelve upcountry airports under the administration of the Uganda Civil Aviation Authority (UCAA). It is also one of the five upcountry airports authorized to handle cross-border air traffic between Uganda and neighboring countries, in an effort to promote tourism within Eastern Africa. Eagle Air has regular flights from Entebbe International Airport on Mondays and Thursdays. As of October 2019, Sky Travel and Aviation also offers twice- weekly flights from Juba International Airport in South Sudan. Charter flights between Gulu and Moyo Airport, Arua Airport, and Pakuba Airport are also occasionally flown. History Dutch multinational company Fugro's airborne survey division was contracted by the government of Uganda to perform airborne geophysical mineral exploration surveys throughout Uganda between 2006 and 2009. To perform its duties in the Northern Region, the company based two aircraft out of Gulu with daily low level (80 meters above ground level) flights up to the Sudanese border. In 2019 the South African company Xcalibur Airborne Geophysics, was hired to carry out similar exploration work over Northeastern Uganda. In course of the air campaign of the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War (1978‚Äì79), Gulu Air Base hosted Ugandan and Libyan military aircraft. During the 21 years of civil war between the rebel Lord‚Äôs Resistance Army (LRA) and the Ugandan government, the Ugandan Air Force was actively based from Gulu. Since the LRA rebel activity ended, the Gulu military presence has been reduced to a sizeable ground force with no aircraft, based around the military hangars west of runway 35. The Air Force Base is used to train UPDF fighter pilots, as of 2019. Facilities Terminal, fire and rescue, and transportation services are available. Fuel, immigration, and customs services are available on arrangement. However, weather service is not available locally. In 2019, Yoweri Museveni, the President of Uganda indicated that Gulu Airport was going to be upgraded to international standards, including construction of a new, larger cargo terminal building, improving firefighting capacity and establishing floodlights for the runway. Other planned improvements include new aircraft hangars, control towers, access routes, ground markings and parking areas for both aircraft and vehicles. In January 2014, phased renovation of the airport was commissioned by the Ugandan Minister of Works and Transport. The first phase involves resurfacing and lengthening the asphalt runway to and widening it to at a budgeted cost of US$4 million. The complete renovation will cost an estimated US$59 million and involves the construction of a larger passenger terminal building, a new car park, access roads, and cargo operations facilities. Other planned improvements include the addition of runway lights, infrastructure for fire and rescue services, and air navigation and traffic control systems. The Gulu non-directional beacon (Ident: GU) is located on the field.

In other countries both the prefix and the number may have different lengths. It shows which exchange the remaining numbers refer to. A full telephone number is usually made up of +251 (required for international calls only), area code (required for calls between telephone areas), prefix, and subscriber number. Some places restrict certain prefixes to fax numbers or cell phones only; in other places such dedicated prefixes are not used. As telephone technology advanced, the precise significance of the prefix became blurred in many places; # 485 in London, UK, was once the GULliver exchange, but now 44-20-7485-xxxx is just considered one of many number blocks served by the CLKEN Kentish Town exchange; 44-20-0777770703xx is another. History In the earliest days of telephony an operator at the exchange connected calls to a named subscriber; later, numbers were allocated to each subscriber on an exchange, but users on different exchanges could not speak to each other. As progress was made, exchanges were connected together, initially connected by the operator by name, and later dialed by users with prefixes such as WHI (for the WHItehall exchange, hence the famous Whitehall 1212 number for Scotland Yard), with letters corresponding to numbers on the dial (WHI was equivalent to # 944), later replaced by the numerical prefixes which remain in use. United States prefixes In most but not all U.S. telephone areas, the prefix 555 is reserved for special services. In particular, 555-1212 is telephone information in most areas. When telephone numbers are used in television programs and movies, a significant number of viewers dial them. Numbers prefixed 555 are usually used for such fictitious use, as they are not allocated to subscribers. When the song 867-5309/Jenny was released, hundreds of calls were made to various people and organizations in the U.S. with that number. In the film Bruce Almighty a phone number belonging to a real user was shown, leading to a lawsuit. Prefixes ending in 11 (211, 311, 411, 511, 611, 711, 811 and 911) are disallowed prefixes because they are service codes.

It passes between Rogers Arena and BC Place Stadium and connects Downtown Vancouver with Main Street and Strathcona. History The first Georgia Street Viaduct was built between 1913 and 1915. The narrow structure included streetcar tracks that were never used. At one point, every second lamppost was removed to reduce weight. It was replaced in 1972 by the current viaduct, which is structurally separated. The current Georgia Viaduct was envisioned in the early 1970s as forming part of an extensive freeway system for Vancouver. However, communities were opposed to the idea of demolishing structures to build the freeway system and the plan was scrapped. The freeways would have required demolishing buildings in neighborhoods including Strathcona, the Downtown Eastside and Chinatown. A predominantly Black Canadian community called Hogan's Alley was bulldozed in building the viaduct. The viaduct opened on January 9, 1972, amid protests who attempted to block mayor Tom Campbell's limousine from reaching the western end. Traffic flow Looking westbound into Vancouver, from the Viaduct's pedestrian sidewalk. Viaduct's westbound exit point from Beatty St. The viaduct's eastbound traffic is fed from Georgia Street and leads vehicles to Prior Street and Main Street. The viaduct's westbound lanes‚Äîoften referred to as Dunsmuir Viaduct because they connect to Dunsmuir Street‚Äîpass to the north of Rogers Arena. The westbound traffic comes from Prior Street and Main Street, and carries vehicles and pedestrians to Dunsmuir Street, downtown which feeds into Melville Street and eventually Pender Street.

Upon his graduation from Dallas, Hendricks accepted the pastorate at Calvary Independent Presbyterian Church (now Calvary Bible Church) in Fort Worth, Texas. An opening on the seminary staff led Hendricks to begin teaching twice per week in the fall of 1951. After one year on staff, Hendricks resigned his post to pursue a doctorate at Yale University. However, the founder and President of Dallas Theological Seminary, Lewis Sperry Chafer, died and the new President, John Walvoord, asked Hendricks to delay his doctorate and return to Dallas as a teacher. For over fifty years, Howard G. Hendricks was a professor at Dallas Theological Seminary, where he taught \\"Bible Exposition and Hermeneutics\\" to freshmen. He mentored many Christian leaders, including Chuck Swindoll, Tony Evans, Joseph Stowell, Robert Jeffress, Chip Ingram and David Jeremiah. He was a keynote speaker for Promise Keepers and authored sixteen books. He ministered in over 80 countries, and he also served as chaplain for the Dallas Cowboys football team from 1976 to 1984. In 1986, the Howard G. Hendricks Center for Christian Leadership opened on the Dallas Theological Seminary campus. This ministry attempts to develop Christian leaders and future church curricula through a process of mentoring.

The Cantor function, Ces√†ro curve, Minkowski's question mark function, the L√©vy C curve, the blancmange curve the Koch curve and the Osgood curve are all special cases of the general de Rham curve. Construction Consider some complete metric space (M,d) (generally \\\\mathbb{R}2 with the usual euclidean distance), and a pair of contracting maps on M: :d_0:\\\\ M \\\\to M :d_1:\\\\ M \\\\to M. By the Banach fixed point theorem, these have fixed points p_0 and p_1 respectively. Let x be a real number in the interval [0,1], having binary expansion :x = \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{b_k}{2^k}, where each b_k is 0 or 1. Consider the map :c_x:\\\\ M \\\\to M defined by :c_x = d_{b_1} \\\\circ d_{b_2} \\\\circ \\\\cdots \\\\circ d_{b_k} \\\\circ \\\\cdots, where \\\\circ denotes function composition. It can be shown that each c_x will map the common basin of attraction of d_0 and d_1 to a single point p_x in M. The collection of points p_x, parameterized by a single real parameter x, is known as the de Rham curve. Continuity condition When the fixed points are paired such that :d_0(p_1) = d_1(p_0) then it may be shown that the resulting curve p_x is a continuous function of x. When the curve is continuous, it is not in general differentiable. In the remaining of this page, we will assume the curves are continuous. Properties De Rham curves are by construction self-similar, since :p(x)=d_0(p(2x)) for x \\\\in [0, 1/2] and :p(x)=d_1(p(2x-1)) for x \\\\in [1/2, 1]. The self-symmetries of all of the de Rham curves are given by the monoid that describes the symmetries of the infinite binary tree or Cantor set. This so-called period-doubling monoid is a subset of the modular group. The image of the curve, i.e. the set of points \\\\\\\\{p(x), x \\\\in [0,1]\\\\\\\\}, can be obtained by an Iterated function system using the set of contraction mappings \\\\\\\\{d_0,\\\\ d_1\\\\\\\\}. But the result of an iterated function system with two contraction mappings is a de Rham curve if and only if the contraction mappings satisfy the continuity condition. Detailed, worked examples of the self-similarities can be found in the articles on the Cantor function and on Minkowski's question-mark function. Precisely the same monoid of self-similarities, the dyadic monoid, apply to every de Rham curve. Classification and examples Ces√†ro curves Ces√†ro curve for a = 0.3 + i 0.3 Ces√†ro curve for a = 0.5 + i 0.5. This is the L√©vy C curve. Ces√†ro curves (or Ces√†ro‚ÄìFaber curves) are De Rham curves generated by affine transformations conserving orientation, with fixed points p_0=0 and p_1=1. Because of these constraints, Ces√†ro curves are uniquely determined by a complex number a such that |a|<1 and |1-a|<1. The contraction mappings d_0 and d_1 are then defined as complex functions in the complex plane by: :d_0(z) = az :d_1(z) = a + (1-a)z. For the value of a=(1+i)/2, the resulting curve is the L√©vy C curve. Koch-Peano curves Koch-Peano curve for a = 0.6 + i 0.37. This is close to, but not quite the Koch curve. Koch-Peano curve for a = 0.6 + i 0.45. This is the Osgood curve. In a similar way, we can define the Koch-Peano family of curves as the set of De Rham curves generated by affine transformations reversing orientation, with fixed points p_0=0 and p_1=1. These mappings are expressed in the complex plane as a function of \\\\overline{z}, the complex conjugate of z: :d_0(z) = a\\\\overline{z} :d_1(z) = a + (1-a)\\\\overline{z}. The name of the family comes from its two most famous members. The Koch curve is obtained by setting: :a_\\\\text{Koch}=\\\\frac{1}{2} + i\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{6}, while the Peano curve corresponds to: :a_\\\\text{Peano}=\\\\frac{(1+i)}{2}. General affine maps Generic affine de Rham curve Generic affine de Rham curve Generic affine de Rham curve Generic affine de Rham curve The Ces√†ro‚ÄìFaber and Peano‚ÄìKoch curves are both special cases of the general case of a pair of affine linear transformations on the complex plane. By fixing one endpoint of the curve at 0 and the other at one, the general case is obtained by iterating on the two transforms :d_0=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\alpha &\\\\delta \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\beta & \\\\varepsilon \\\\end{pmatrix} and :d_1=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1&0&0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\alpha & 1-\\\\alpha&\\\\zeta \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta&-\\\\beta&\\\\eta \\\\end{pmatrix}. Being affine transforms, these transforms act on a point (u,v) of the 2-D plane by acting on the vector :\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ u \\\\\\\\\\\\ v \\\\end{pmatrix}. The midpoint of the curve can be seen to be located at (u,v)=(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta); the other four parameters may be varied to create a large variety of curves. The blancmange curve of parameter w can be obtained by setting \\\\alpha=\\\\beta=1/2, \\\\delta=\\\\zeta=0 and \\\\varepsilon=\\\\eta=w. That is: :d_0=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1&0&0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1/2&0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&1/2&w; \\\\end{pmatrix} and :d_1=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1&0&0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1/2 & 1/2&0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1/2&-1/2&w; \\\\end{pmatrix}. Since the blancmange curve of parameter w=1/4 is the parabola of equation f(x)=4x(1-x), this illustrate the fact that in some occasion, de Rham curves can be smooth. Minkowski's question mark function Minkowski's question mark function is generated by the pair of maps :d_0(z) = \\\\frac{z}{z+1} and :d_1(z)= \\\\frac{1}{z+1}.  Generalizations  It is easy to generalize the definition by using more than two contraction mappings. If one uses n mappings, then the n-ary decomposition of x has to be used instead of the binary expansion of real numbers. The continuity condition has to be generalized in: :d_i(p_{n-1})=d_{i+1}(p_0), for i=0 \\\\ldots n-2. This continuity condition can be understood with the following example. Suppose on is working in base-10. Then one has (famously) that 0.999...= 1.000... which is a continuity equation that must be enforced at every such gap. That is, given the decimal digits b_1,b_2,\\\\cdots,b_k with b_k e 9, one has :b_1,b_2,\\\\cdots,b_k,9,9,9,\\\\cdots = b_1,b_2,\\\\cdots,b_k+1,0,0,0,\\\\cdots Such a generalization allows, for example, to produce the Sierpi≈Ñski arrowhead curve (whose image is the Sierpi≈Ñski triangle), by using the contraction mappings of an iterated function system that produces the Sierpi≈Ñski triangle. Multifractal curves Ornstein and others describe a multifractal system, where instead of working in a fixed base, one works in a variable base. Consider the product space of variable base-m_n discrete spaces :\\\\Omega=\\\\prod_{n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}}A_{n} for A_n=\\\\mathbb{Z}/m_n\\\\mathbb{Z}=\\\\\\\\{ 0,1,\\\\cdots,m_n-1\\\\\\\\} the cyclic group, for m_n\\\\ge2 an integer. Any real number in the unit interval can be expanded in a sequence (a_1,a_2,a_3,\\\\cdots) such that each a_n\\\\in A_n. More precisely, a real number 0\\\\le x\\\\le 1 is written as :x=\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{a_n}{\\\\prod_{k=1}^n m_k} This expansion is not unique, if all a_n=0 past some point K. In this case, one has that :a_1,a_2,\\\\cdots,a_K,0,0,\\\\cdots = a_1,a_2,\\\\cdots,a_K-1,m_{K+1}-1, m_{K+2}-1,\\\\cdots Such points are analogous to the dyadic rationals in the dyadic expansion, and the continuity equations on the curve must be applied at these points. For each A_n, one must specify two things: a set of two points p_0^{(n)} and p_1^{(n)} and a set of m_n functions d_j^{(n)}(z) (with j\\\\in A_n). The continuity condition is then as above, :d_j^{(n)}(p^{(n+1)}_1)=d_{j+1}^{(n)}(p^{(n+1)}_0), for j=0, \\\\cdots ,m_n-2. Ornstein's original example used :\\\\Omega=\\\\left(\\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\right)\\\\times \\\\left(\\\\mathbb{Z}/3\\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\right)\\\\times \\\\left(\\\\mathbb{Z}/4\\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\right)\\\\times \\\\cdots  See also  * Iterated function system * Refinable function * Modular group * Fuchsian group  References  Further reading * Georges de Rham, On Some Curves Defined by Functional Equations (1957), reprinted in Classics on Fractals, ed.

It is centrally located within the southern Highlands, positioned almost equidistantly from the Kittatinny Valley in the west and the Piedmont plateau in the east. Schooley's Mountain is also one of the largest ridges in a group of geologically similar and parallel mountains, which include Allamuchy Mountain, Pohatcong Mountain, Scotts Mountain, and Jenny Jump Mountain.  Geography  Schooley's Mountain is separated from Musconetcong Mountain by a gap and the valley of Spruce Run, which bifurcates the mountain itself higher in its course. The mountain ridge extends about 20 miles northeast, being separated by Budd Lake and the South Branch Raritan River from Mooney Mountain. The northeasternmost point looks out upon Waterloo and the Musconetcong River, the valley of which lies upon its northwestern side; on the southeastern side is Washington Township, Morris County, New Jersey, drained by the South Branch Raritan River. Prominent subsidiary peaks include Mount Kipp (), at the southeastern tip, and Point Mountain (), overlooking Anderson in the Musconetcong Valley. The summit of the ridge proper lies in an area of private homes on Kim Lane, on the northeastern part of the ridge.USGS 7.5-minute image map for Hackettstown, New Jersey, 2014. The community of Schooley's Mountain is on top and in the middle of the ridge, which rises about above the surrounding valley.  History  The mountain is named for the Schooley family, Quaker landowners in the area during the 1790s. The mountain air and the chalybeate springs on the mountain once made it a fashionable summer destination. For similar reasons, a state tuberculosis sanatorium was once located around Mount Kipp. Many small iron mines were worked on the mountain in the late 19th century; remains of some are still visible today. Granite was also quarried from the mountain. The main crossing at the mountain is Schooley's Mountain Road, formerly Washington Turnpike. General George Washington noted in his diary that he considered the route from \\"Dutch Valley to Schooley's Mountain a hazardous and round about thoroughfare.\\"  Recreation  While much of the flatter terrain on the ridge has been cultivated or, more recently, developed for residential housing, much of Schooley's Mountain is still wooded. On the northwest side, Cataract Park, along Schooleys Mountain Road (Route 24), preserves a waterfall and an old mine opening on the steep side of the ridge. Schooley's Mountain County Park, home of Randolph YMCA's Camp Washington, encloses the valley of Long Valley and small Lake George on the southeastern side of the mountain. Lake George has been drained and dredged but swimming is no longer permitted. The Electric Brook runs from Lake George over several waterfalls in the park before it reaches the south branch of the Raritan River. The park offers boat rental and numerous amenities above and beyond hiking. One of the completed segments of Patriots' Path runs through the park.

A live episode of Headbangers Ball was also part of the broadcast that night, hosted by Dave Grohl as he interviewed special guests SuicideGirls.  Special guests and events  The 24-hour live broadcast also included other special events, including a drum circle in Times Square (which also featured Stewart Copeland), science experiments with Cockeyed.com's Rob Cockerham, an on-air wedding, a trivia game featuring comedian David Cross, and other appearances from MTV personalities and friends, including MTV News reporter Gideon Yago, comedian and actress Janeane Garofalo, Saturday Night Live's Amy Poehler and Fred Armisen, and comedian Robert Smigel as Triumph the Insult Comic Dog. MTV2 VJ Jim Shearer was master of ceremonies for the event, launching the broadcast and staying with the Foo Fighters throughout all 24 hours until the end of the show. While some viewers noted that there was not a wide selection of music played during the broadcast, others believed that 24 Hours of Foo demonstrated MTV2 could still put together and air an unusually spectacular live special. Since 24 Hours of Foo, there were no other large-scale live broadcasts on MTV2 until 2007 when Human Giant 24 Aired on MTV2.

The series debuted on VH1 on April 2, 2006, and despite lasting only ten episodes, received substantial acclaim from critics. Premise The series follows the actress as she tries to downplay the fact that she is the daughter of Aaron Spelling (his name is rarely mentioned in series; he is referred to by Tori as \\"Daddy\\" and taking a cue from Charlie's Angels is only heard off-camera). Despite the fact that her father is very wealthy, Tori tries to prove that she just wants people to like her for herself and take her seriously. Along with Tori the show features her close friends Pete (James Carpinello), a roommate who shares Tori's condo and has a habit of bringing women to the place every night by bragging about Tori being his roommate; Janey (Brennan Hesser), a real estate agent with a habit for being nosy and ambitious; and Sasan (Zachary Quinto), an openly bisexual (except to his parents) Iranian-American who tends to be critical at times, hoping it will knock a little sense into Tori. She is also seen carrying around her overweight pug Mimi LaRue, who is frequently dressed in tacky designer clothes. In addition, Tori also has to deal with her self-absorbed mother Candy \\"KiKi\\" Spelling, whose history of how Tori was raised and why she treats her daughter as if she doesn't exist may explain why Tori acts like she does; Margaret (Cleo King), the nanny who raised Tori and is more motherly to her than KiKi; and Ruthie Rose, her frenetic, doting, and not-so-reliable manager.

The New York Post raved that the show was a \\"very witty, sometimes brilliantly insightful hybrid sitcom\\". Newsday admired that \\"the writing is pointed, the direction tight. But what really makes it work is Tori herself, light, bright and vulnerably likable.\\" The Hollywood Reporter called the show \\"considerably more ambitious than a lot of other sitcoms\\" and said that \\"It's easy to dismiss this as another attempt by Spelling to prove that her talent goes beyond her last name, but there's more to it than that. She creates an appealing character despite all the preconceptions, many of which are acknowledged and dispensed with in the first few scenes.\\" The Los Angeles Times conceded that \\"while this sort of thing has been done before ‚Äì it has been done here exceedingly well.\\" The Chicago Tribune began their review with \\"there are people in the world who'll never watch anything that stars Tori Spelling. Their loss.\\" The review went on to praise the show; admitting that \\"Spelling‚Äôs surprisingly good VH1 series, is a not-at-all-guilty pleasure. It has more than its share of amusing moments, and it also has a surprising amount of heart.\\" The Detroit Free Press called the show \\"a sassy, classy winner.\\" The show was nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series at the 2007 GLAAD Media Awards. Additional information Created by Chris Alberghini, Mike Chessler and Tori Spelling, the series was produced by NBC Universal Television. It was originally intended for the NBC network, but when they passed on the completed pilot episode the producers sought another outlet and eventually landed a deal with VH1. Paramount Home Entertainment issued the November 21, 2006 DVD release So NoTORIous: The Complete Series.

Its fossils are known from the Morrison Formation of the south-western United States. The type and only species, Nanosaurus agilis, was described and named by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1877. The taxon has a complicated taxonomic history, largely the work of Marsh and Peter M. Galton, involving the genera Laosaurus, Hallopus, Drinker, Othnielia, and Othnielosaurus, the latter three now being considered to be synonyms of Nanosaurus. It had historically been classified as a hypsilophodont or fabrosaur, types of generalized small bipedal herbivore, but more recent research has abandoned these groupings as paraphyletic and Nanosaurus is today considered a basal member of Neornithischia. Description Size compared to a human Nanosaurus is known from material from all parts of the body, including two good skeletons, although the skull is still poorly known. It was a small animal, 2 meters (6.6 ft) or less in length and 10 kilograms (22 lb) or less in weight. It was a bipedal dinosaur with short forelimbs and long hindlimbs with large processes for muscle attachments. The hands were short and broad with short fingers. The head was small. It had small leaf-shaped cheek teeth (triangular and with small ridges and denticles lining the front and back edges), and premaxillary teeth with less ornamentation. Like several other neornithischian dinosaurs, such as Hypsilophodon, Thescelosaurus, and Talenkauen, Nanosaurus had thin plates lying along the ribs. Called intercostal plates, these structures were cartilaginous in origin. History and taxonomy Marsh's original groundwork Holotype dentary and ilium In 1877, Marsh named two species of Nanosaurus in separate publications, based on partial remains from the Morrison Formation of Garden Park, Colorado. One paper described N. agilis, based on YPM 1913, with remains including impressions of a dentary, and postcranial bits including an ilium, thigh bones, shin bones, and a fibula. The other paper named N. rex, a second species which Marsh based on YPM 1915 (also called 1925 in Galton, 2007), a complete thigh bone. He regarded both species as small (\\"fox-sized\\") animals. A third species, N. victor, was named, which he soon recognized to be something completely different, and is now known as the small, bipedal crocodylomorph Hallopus. Othniel Charles Marsh's 1896 skeletal restoration of \\"Laosaurus\\" consors (now Nanosaurus). The next year, he named the new genus Laosaurus on material collected by Samuel Wendell Williston from Como Bluff, Wyoming. Two species were named: the type species L. celer, based on parts of eleven vertebrae (YPM 1875); and the \\"smaller\\" L. gracilis, originally based on a back vertebra's centrum, a caudal centrum, and part of an ulna (review by Peter Galton in 1983 finds the specimen to now consist of thirteen back and eight caudal centra, and portions of both hindlimbs). A third species, L. consors, was established by Marsh in 1894 for YPM 1882, which consists of most of one articulated skeleton and part of at least one other individual. The skull was only partially preserved, and the fact that the vertebrae were represented only by centra suggests a partially grown individual. Galton (1983) notes that much of the current mounted skeleton was restored in plaster, or had paint applied. Galton's taxonomic revisions Casts of Nanosaurus (Othnielia) rex mounted as if a herd running, Denver Museum of Nature and Science. These animals attracted little professional attention until the 1970s and 1980s, when Peter Galton reviewed many the \\"hypsilophodonts\\" in a series of papers. In 1973, he and Jim Jensen described a partial skeleton (BYU ESM 163 as of Galton, 2007) missing the head, hands, and tail as Nanosaurus? rex, which had been damaged by other collectors prior to description. By 1977, he had concluded that Nanosaurus agilis was quite different from N. rex and the new skeleton, and coined Othnielia for the latter species. The paper (primarily concerning the transcontinental nature of Dryosaurus) considered Laosaurus consors and L. gracilis synonyms of O. rex without elaboration, and considered L. celer an invalid nomen nudum. In 1990, Robert Bakker, Peter Galton, James Siegwarth, and James Filla described remains of a dinosaur they named Drinker nisti. The name is somewhat ironic; Drinker, named for renowned palaeontologist Edward Drinker Cope whose infamous \\"bone wars\\" with rival Othniel Charles Marsh produced many dinosaur fossils which are world-famous today, was described as a probable close relative of Othnielia, named for Marsh. The species name refers to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Discovered by Siegwarth and Filla in upper Morrison Formation beds at Como Bluff, Wyoming, it was based on a partial subadult skeleton (listed as CPS 106 originally, then as Tate 4001 by Bakker 1996) including partial jaws, vertebrae, and partial limbs. Several other specimens found in the same area were assigned to it, mostly consisting of vertebral and hindlimb remains, and teeth. The holotype specimen's current location is unknown; according to Carpenter and Galton (2018), the previous two institutions reported to have had it did not ever curate the specimen, and the collection it was originally said to be in never existed at all. Life restoration of Nanosaurus (Othnielosaurus) consors Several decades later, in his 2007 study of the teeth of Morrison ornithischians, concluded that the holotype femur of Othniela rex is not diagnostic, and reassigned the BYU skeleton to Laosaurus consors, which is based on better material. As the genus Laosaurus is also based on nondiagnostic material, he gave the species L. consors its own genus, Othnielosaurus. As a result, in practical terms, what had been thought of as Othnielia is now known as Othnielosaurus consors. Regarding Nanosaurus agilis, Galton considered it a potentially valid basal ornithopod, and noted similarities to heterodontosaurids in the thigh bone. He tentatively assigned to it some teeth that had been referred to Drinker. Another decade later, in 2018, Galton, alongside Kenneth Carpenter, described a new ornithischian specimen. They found it very similar to the fragmentary holotype of Nanosaurus, but more clear in its anatomical features. Their new specimen was also found to display extreme similarity with the specimens of Othnielosaurus and Drinker. Due to the new data, they concluded that all three species, alongside Othnielia, represented the same animal, united under the name Nanosaurus agilis. This painted a new picture of a singular, very common small dinosaur known from a large amount of material. This conclusion has been recognized by papers since, some of which incorporating the new, all- encompassing taxon into their phylogenetic analyses.

The church has a reputation of being one of Southern California's most liberal churches and one of the largest Episcopal churches in the country. Former Rector Ed Bacon said that political activism \\"is in the DNA of the church.\\" In 1980, All Saints was listed by the National Park Service on the National Register of Historic Places as a Contributing Structure to the Pasadena Civic Center District.  History of the parish  In November 1882, eleven people gathered in the home of Mr. and Mrs. C.C. Brown for services conducted by the Reverend Trew. In 1885 the congregation dedicated its first church building at the corner of Colorado Blvd. and Garfield Ave. on April 5 (Easter Day). The parish continued to grow rapidly, and a new site was purchased at 132 North Euclid for the building of a 600-seat church. First services were held Easter Day, April 21, 1889. The congregation outgrew the church building, and a new church building was built in 1923. It was designed by architects Roland Coate (1890‚Äì1958), Reginald Davis Johnson (1882‚Äì1952) and Gordon Kaufmann (1888‚Äì1949), and it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.'All Saints' church in Pasadena to have new home', Los Angeles Times, 5, 06/10/1923'All Saints' Church, Pasadena', Architectural Digest, 8: 2, 69, 1931 It opened in 1924. All Saints bought additional property in 1926‚Äì7, where it built a parish hall and rectory. The architects for these buildings were Cyril Bennett and Fitch Harrison Haskell, designers of the Civic Auditorium. They were also designed in the English Gothic style, and form an integrated courtyard with the main church. The Parish Hall suffered extensive damage during two fires in 1976.National Park Service.

Edwin (Ed) Bacon (1995‚Äì2016) * The Reverend Michael Kinman (2016‚ÄìPresent) All Saints leaders and parishioners agreed that the church needed to add to its building space to house the increased scope of its activities. Having grown to 3,500 members in the congregation, 125 ministries and 13,000 per year, the facilities built in the 1920s were inadequate for the 21st Century. In 1999, the church hired architect Michael Palladino to design a suitable space. He developed a four-building complex employing a contemporary design, but using many of the same architectural materials as the existing complex. The proposal was presented to the Pasadena planning commission in 2007, and was estimated to cost $46.0 million. In 2008, the commission ruled that the proposed project could not proceed until a new full environmental impact report (EIR) could be produced and approved. The draft report was issued in July, 2010.Sewell, Abby. \\"Pasadena's All Saints Episcopal Church and preservationists battle over architecture.\\" Los Angeles Times. July 24, 2010 Accessed September 18, 2017. Public criticism of the proposal continue all the while, and it took five years to get the necessary approvals from the city. Meanwhile, estimated construction costs escalated dramatically because of revisions, legal fees and preparation of the EIR. According to the chairman of the building committee, the 2015 cost to complete the project would be over $70.0 million. During this time several large donors had either died or moved away from Pasadena. Furthermore, Ed Bacon was scheduled to retire from the church in May 2016. Therefore, Bacon announced that he was putting execution of the project on hold until his replacement could restart it.Henry, Jason. \\"Why a major expansion of Pasadena's All Saints Church is now in doubt.\\" Pasadena Star-News.

Regas pointed out that no (mainline) churches were even talking about such issues as racial justice in the early 1960s.

The premise of the sermon was a debate between George W. Bush and John Kerry moderated by Jesus Christ. In the sermon Regas supposed that, \\"Jesus [would say], 'Mr. President, your doctrine of preemptive war is a failed doctrine. Forcibly changing the regime of an enemy that posed no imminent threat has led to disaster.'\\" Complaints about the sermon led to an investigation by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) into whether the sermon voided the church's tax-exempt status as a prohibited political endorsement. The church responded by claiming that the IRS is selectively enforcing the rule by not pursuing actions against conservative churches. In response to the investigation, Rector Ed Bacon gave a sermon called, \\"Neighbor Love is Never Neutral.\\" In September 2006, the IRS issued a summons against All Saints demanding that the church turn over documents related to the controversial sermon. All Saints Church's response was that the IRS was violating the church's First Amendment rights and that the Church would challenge the IRS's actions in a summons enforcement proceeding in the United States Federal District Court. The church then established a charitable fund to raise money for its legal defense. The Pasadena Star News reported that All Saints would remain defiant against the IRS. Rector Ed Bacon asserted that political activism was \\"in the DNA\\" of the church. Result of IRS investigation On September 25, 2007, CCH reported in Federal Tax Day: According to the Pasadena Star News, the IRS told church officials that the sermon constituted an endorsement of a candidate. Rector Ed Bacon demanded that the IRS apologize and that the IRS be investigated. The Rev. Ed Bacon stated: The Church's legal counsel has asked the IRS for a clarification of the decision, and for assurance that the IRS did not act under pressure from the White House. The Church has also requested that the U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) examine the IRS's investigation.Id.  The Sabeel Controversy  In 2008, relations with the local Jewish community were strained when the Church hosted the pro- Palestinian Sabeel conference.Middle East tensions in Pasadena (Los Angeles Times 2-9-08) Rabbi emeritus of the Pasadena Jewish Temple and Center, Rabbi Gil Kollin, said: \\"As a neighbor, I was disappointed.

It was established in 1882. Regular events include: *Royal Manitoba Winter Fair - annual agricultural fair near the end of March *The Manitoba Summer Fair - annual fair in mid-June. Features the North American Midway *The Manitoba Ag Ex - annual all breeds cattle show during October History Established in 1882, the organization was formed shortly after the incorporation of the city of Brandon and two years before the Chamber of Commerce. Originally, the organization was formed by the agricultural community surrounding the city to showcase and sell their agricultural products. From this idea the Brandon Agricultural Society was formed and in October 1882 local businessmen put up $200 and called for entries for cattle, horses, pigs, poultry and grains. This was the start of the exhibition's first fair, today known as the Manitoba Summer Fair. The need soon arose for a second annual fair and by March 1908 the Brandon Winter Fair was born. The purpose of this fair was primarily to promote the sale of livestock and to encourage improvement in the breeding lines and care of animals. Numerous educational opportunities were added to the fair as well as displays by government agencies, implement dealers and other manufacturers. In addition, there was now the opportunity to attend lectures and meetings of breed associations and other agricultural groups. But as before, it was the horse sales that attracted the most attention. In those early years, both fairs ran independently. The summer show began on the corner of what is today 10th and Victoria Avenue and moved to its present location on the Keystone Centre grounds in the late 19th century. The Winter Fair began on the Keystone Centre grounds and later moved to the Wheat City Arena location and remained there until the building of the Keystone Centre, which remains its home to this day. In 1967, the amalgamation of the two fairs took place and the Provincial Exhibition of Manitoba became an entity. On July 11, 1970, the Brandon Winter Fair was granted Patronage by a visit from her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and became the Royal Manitoba Winter Fair. Manitoba Ag EX, the youngest of the three productions, made its first appearance in 1974 and at that time was known as Ag Ex. Today, the Manitoba Ag Ex is one of Manitoba's largest cattle show and sales. After a few name changes from Manitoba Fall Fair and Manitoba Livestock Expo, The Manitoba Ag Ex name was resurrected for the 2015 event and is continued to this day. The Provincial Exhibition of Manitoba undertook the restoration of the historic Display Building Number Two, also known as 'the Dome Building,' which was constructed for the Dominion Exhibition in 1913 and has been in use by the Provincial Exhibition ever since. It was urgently in need of repair. Display Building Number Two is a National Historic Site of Canada, and also enjoys a Provincial heritage designation. As one of only two remaining buildings in Canada of the particular architectural style, the Exhibition returned it to its former grandeur, and in 2018 located its offices in the building after its restoration.

He then moved to Sydney in early 1856 where he worked as a clerk at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney before being drawn to Rockhampton by the Canoona gold rush. While living in Sydney he met Maria Isabella Berthold, a German immigrant, and they had a son, Auguste. Thozet established the second hotel in Rockhampton, the Alliance, but driven by a never failing professional interest in botany he commenced researching native Australian plants used by indigenous people of Northern Queensland, Australia including the Darumbal clans around Rockhampton. Thozet established his own plant nursery in North Rockhampton on which are today bounded by Thozet Creek, Thozet Road, Rockonia Road and the Fitzroy River. Thozet was instrumental in developing the Rockhampton Botanic Gardens founded in 1861, the first Rockhampton (south) cemetery, and the tree plantings along the Fitzroy River CBD area. He supplied plant and seed specimens to other botanists and Botanical Gardens, including Ferdinand von Mueller, Victorian government botanist and director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne. In 1866 he published Notes on Some of the Roots, Tubers, Bulbs and Fruits Used as Vegetable Food by the Aboriginals of Northern Queensland, Australia, W H Buzacott, Rockhampton. This pamphlet includes a description of midamo, a mixture of mangrove roots and berries made by baking the root of the common mangrove (Avicennia Tomentosa) called Egaie by the tribes of Cleveland Bay, and Tagon‚ÄìTagon by those of Rockhampton. Thozet was active in promoting the interests of Rockhampton overseas, and in the Separation League, attempting to have the northern portion of Queensland recognised as a separate State. The family travelled overseas 1869‚Äì1872; and while in London, Anthelme and Maria were married (1872). Anthelme Thozet died in 1878 from bilious fever contracted on an expedition to Blackwater and was buried in the garden of his property Muellerville. His son Auguste and daughter-in-law Lucy Anne (n√©e Nobbs) were buried beside him in 1902 and this small family cemetery is located on Codd Street, North Rockhampton. His widow was buried in the North Rockhampton cemetery when she died in 1923. In 2010, Rockhampton Regional Council and the University of Queensland conducted archeological investigations, locating three graves at the north end of Norris Park, which lies on land that was part of the original Muellerville property. In 2012, the Council installed a new headstone for the graves, and a memorial marker informing visitors that \\"this parkland is the last remaining portion of the 66 acre experimental garden known as 'Muellerville', once owned by Frenchborn botanist and botanical pioneer Anthelme Thozet\\". A building at the Primary Industries Research Centre (Plant Sciences Group) at Central Queensland University at Rockhampton is named in his honour. A creek and a road in Rockhampton also bear his name, and the tree species, Eucalyptus thozetiana was named in his honour. In 1875, he was made a fellow of the Royal Colonial Institute. The website Bionomia shows that the specimens he collected continue to contribute to scientific knowledge with (as of June 2020) six publications having used his specimens).

Phyllodon sp.\\" in \\"10.3 Gloucestershire, England; 2. Chipping Norton Formation,\\" in Weishampel, et al. (2004). Page 538. It may have been closely related to contemporaneous dinosaurs in North America. This genus is known from teeth and possibly partial lower jaws. The name is also in use for a genus of modern moss, but this is not considered to be a problem because the two organisms are in two different kingdoms. History Phyllodon is based on MGSP G5, a partial lower jaw tooth recovered from a lignite marl in a mine near the city of Leiria. Richard Thulborn, who described the genus, added an upper beak tooth (MGSP G2). He regarded the new genus as a hypsilophodontid, and presented a conjectural restoration of the tooth arrangement. Peter Galton, reviewing Late Jurassic North American hypsilophodontids a few years later, found that the Phyllodon teeth best matched those of Nanosaurus, and agreed with a hypsilophodontid identity because the lower jaw tooth is asymmetric in front and back views. Because of the sparse material, Phyllodon has often been tossed off as a dubious basal ornithopod of uncertain affinities. However, more material that might belong to this genus has been recovered from the original locality and described. Included in this material are over 120 more teeth from all parts of the jaw and four partial lower jaws with the teeth lost. Oliver Rauhut, who described the new material, tentatively identified the lower jaws as Phyllodon due to there being no other similar dinosaurs found at the locality. The teeth were very small (up to 3 millimeters across, or 0.1 inches) and possibly juvenile. He also found additional diagnostic characteristics for Phyllodon in the new material, including very tall upper jaw teeth, indicating that it could be a valid genus after all. After comparing it to other hypsilophodonts, he found that it best matched the roughly contemporaneous Drinker of the North American Morrison Formation, with various details suggesting that they were closely related. Similarly, Galton found its teeth to be similar to those of Drinker and Nanosaurus in his 2006 review. Paleobiology As a hypsilophodontid or other basal ornithopod, Phyllodon would have been a bipedal herbivore. Its size has not been estimated, but as most adult hypsilophodonts were long, this genus would probably have been of similar size. Its similarity to the North American Drinker and Nanosaurus is another piece of evidence linking Late Jurassic Portuguese dinosaur faunas with the contemporaneous Morrison Formation dinosaurs.

The SVU was developed to meet the needs of the security forces of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, such as OMON. The SVU was first seen in use in the First Chechen War. Originally, the plan was to just slightly modernize the aging SVD, but the designers eventually realised that the configuration of the weapon would have to be completely altered, leading to the creation of the SVU. A special muzzle brake was added that could absorb up to 40% of the recoil energy and an elastic butt stock with lamellar spring was non-rigidly attached to the receiver. The acoustics of the rifle were also improved by adding a sound suppressor. The other main improvements made to the SVU over the SVD include replacement of the butt stock, pistol grip, trigger and the mounting for the sight; and shortening the barrel by 100 mm achieved perfect balance for the weapon. Around 1991, the Russians developed a slight variant of the OTs-03, the OTs-03A (SVU-A). Whereas the SVU is semi-automatic, the SVU-A (the A stands for automatic) is a fully automatic rifle. In this rifle, the center of gravity was moved forward by the addition of a forward extended bipod mounted on the receiver. Developing 20 and 30 round magazines increased the capacity of the magazine so that it could be used effectively in full automatic mode; and better optics were incorporated into the SVU-A to replace the previous units, which had been left almost untouched since the SVD. Though it has folding iron sights, the SVU is almost always used with the PSO-1 scope with illuminated reticle, but other Russian scopes can also be mounted. The PSO-1 reticle is almost unique in the world of sniper scopes, in that its rangefinders are in the lower left, chevrons for bullet drop compensation are found in the middle, and stadia marks for windage to the left and right of the center reticule. The reticle is also illuminated by radioactive tritium instead of a small battery-powered lamp. The SVU also comes with an adjustable bipod. It has an integral flash hider and muzzle brake. A bayonet may be fitted under the forestock.

The remaining residents primarily speak other languages from the Afroasiatic family, Nilo-Saharan languages or Indo-European languages. Ethno-linguistic demographics According to linguists, the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations arrived in the region during the Neolithic period from the family's proposed urheimat (\\"original homeland\\") in the Nile Valley,Zarins, Juris (1990), \\"Early Pastoral Nomadism and the Settlement of Lower Mesopotamia\\", (Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research) or the Near East.Diamond J, Bellwood P (2003) Farmers and Their Languages: The First Expansions SCIENCE 300, Other scholars propose that the Afro-Asiatic family developed in situ in the Horn, with its speakers subsequently dispersing from there. Eritrea's population now comprises nine ethnic groups, most of whom speak languages from the Semitic and Cushitic branches of the Afro-Asiatic family. Estimates of numbers of speakers given below are from SIL Ethnologue unless otherwise noted. Afro-Asiatic languages The languages spoken in Eritrea are Tigrinya, Tigre, and Dahlik (formerly considered a dialect of Tigre). Together, they are spoken by around 70% of local residents: *Tigrinya, spoken as a first language by the Tigrinya people. As of 2006, there were around 2.54 million speakers. *Tigre, spoken by the Tigre people. As of 2006, there were around 1.05 million speakers. *Dahlik, spoken in the Dahlak Archipelago. Variously regarded as either a divergent dialect of Tigre or a separate language, it was recently assigned its own ISO 639-3 code. As of 2012, there were around 2,500 speakers. Other Afro-Asiatic languages belonging to the family's Cushitic branch are also spoken in the country. They are spoken by around 10% of residents and include: *Beja (Bedawiyet), spoken by the Hedareb. It is sometimes classified as an independent branch of the Afro- Asiatic family. As of 2006, there were 158,000 speakers in Eritrea. *Saho, spoken by the Saho people. It is sometimes grouped with Afar as Saho-Afar. As of 2006, there were around 789,000 speakers in Eritrea. *Afar, spoken by the Afar people, predominantly in Ethiopia and Djibouti. As of 2006, there were fewer than 100,000 speakers in Eritrea. *Blin or Belin, spoken by the Bilen people in the Anseba region and Keren town area. As of 2006, there were around 91,000 speakers. *Amharic Nilo-Saharan languages In addition, languages belonging to the Nilo-Saharan language family are spoken as a mother tongue by the Kunama and Nara Nilotic ethnic minorities that live in the north and northwestern part of the country. Around 187,000 individuals speak the Kunama language, while around 81,400 people speak the Nara language. As of 2006, this corresponds with around 3.5% and 1.5%, respectively, of total residents. Foreign languages Arabic is mostly found in the form of Modern Standard Arabic as an educational language taught in primary and secondary schools, but there are native speakers of dialectal variants of Arabic, as follows: *Sudanese Arabic, also spoken by Sudanese Arabs. It has around 100,000 speakers. *Hijazi Arabic, spoken by the Rashaida. As of 2006, there were around 24,000 speakers. Italian was introduced in the 19th century by the colonial authorities in Italian Eritrea but is now used in commerce at times. It serves as the mother tongue of very few Italian Eritreans. English was introduced in the 1940s under the British military administration of Italian Eritrea. It is now used as the de facto working language. Official status The 1997 Constitution of Eritrea does not define any official languages. It states that \\"the equality of all Eritrean languages is guaranteed\\" without providing a conclusive list of the languages in question. The CIA Factbook cites Tigrigna, Arabic and English as official languages, alongside ethnic Eritrean languages like Tigre, Afar and other Cushitic languages, as well as the Nilo-Saharan Kunama. SIL Ethnologue lists Tigrigna as the de facto language of national identity, Arabic as the de facto national language, and English as the de facto working language. The Eritrean embassy in Sweden says, \\"The main working languages are Tigrigna and Arabic. English is the medium of instruction from middle school level upwards.\\"http://www.eritrean- embassy.se/about-eritrea/people-and-languages/ Writing and literacy According to the Ministry of Information of Eritrea, an estimated 80% of the country's population is literate. In terms of writing systems, Eritrea's principal orthography is Ge'ez, Latin script and Arabic script. Ge'ez is employed as an abugida for the two most spoken languages in the country: Tigrigna and Tigre. It first came into usage in the 6th and 5th centuries BC as an abjad to transcribe the Semitic Ge'ez language.Rodolfo Fattovich, \\"Akk√§l√§ Guzay\\" in Uhlig, Siegbert, ed. Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: A-C. Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz KG, 2003, p. 169. Ge'ez now serves as the liturgical language of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Churches. The Latin script is used to write the majority of the country's other languages excluding Arabic. The Arabic script has also been used to write Afar, Beja, Saho and Tigre in the past. However, Tigre is mostly written in Ge'ez script now while the Latin script is used to write the other languages. For example, Qafar Feera, a modified Latin script, serves as an orthography for transcribing Afar.

It is based on IVPP V.11117 (1-2), two teeth. It is an obscure genus, with no papers doing more than mentioning it since it was described. History The teeth that would be named Siluosaurus were recovered during the 1992 Sino-Japanese Silk Road Dinosaur Expedition. One tooth, seven millimetres long, was from the upper beak (premaxilla), and the other, 3.7 millimetres high, was from the cheek region of the upper jaw (maxilla). Dong Zhiming, who named the genus in 1997, suggested that it was a hypsilophodontid, and described the teeth as the smallest ornithopod teeth yet known. The type species is Siluosaurus zhanggiani. The specific name honours Zhang Qian, the Chinese diplomat who reconnoitred the Silk Road in the second century B.C. It was regarded without comment as a dubious name in the most recent review of basal ornithopods, a not-uncommon fate for dinosaur names based on teeth. Paleobiology As a hypsilophodontid or other basal ornithopod, Siluosaurus would have been a bipedal herbivore. Its size has not been estimated, but as most adult hypsilophodonts were long, this genus would have been of similar to smaller size, based on Dong's comments.
