The goal of the research project was to examine the mass internment of Japanese Americans via selected Nisei social students from the campus. It was an academic study on the migration, confinement, and resettlement of Japanese Americans during World War II. It aimed to document and examine the mass internment of Japanese Americans by embedding Nisei social science students recruited from the Berkeley campus into selected internment sites. The study also documented the resettlement phase in the city of Chicago. The collection consists of daily journals, field reports, life histories, and secondary research materials collected and compiled by the research staff. There is also extensive correspondence between staff, evacuees, and others. These records were deposited in the University Library in August 1948 by sociologist and Director of JERS, Dorothy Swaine Thomas. The JERS staff concentrated on Tule Lake, Gila River, and Poston/Colorado River, with minor involvement at Topaz/Central Utah, Manzanar, and Minidoka. Material was also gathered from temporary detention centers, primarily the Tanforan and Tulare centers located in California.

Moss-Christian, who has been working with fisheries for over 20 years, was the first woman to chair the WCPFC. She also advises the Marshall Islands Government on Oceans and Trade.  Early life and education  Born in the Marshall Islands, Moss-Christian commenced her career in fisheries by assisting the Marshall Islands Government in regional fisheries meetings and United Nations negotiations. Moss-Christian holds a Master of Arts in International Policy Studies, 2005 (Stanford University), a Post-Graduate Certificate in Diplomatic Studies, 2000 (Oxford University) and a Bachelor of Arts majoring in Politics, 1996 (University of California Santa Cruz). When working towards her degree at the University of California Santa Cruz, she became interested in fisheries.  Career  Moss-Christian moved to Majuro in 1996 and was chosen to represent the Marshall Islands at the 30th Forum Fisheries Committee. Moss-Christian made history in December 2014 as the first woman to be elected as chair of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission and was then elected to a second two-year term in December 2016, which was reported as a testament to the respect she had won from Commission members. The Commission membership includes all the major fishing nations from Europe, Asia and North America, as well as developing Pacific nations such as Indonesia and the Philippines. Moss-Christian and WCPFC Executive Director, Feleti Teo, have been notable for guiding Commission members to achieve more progress by setting realistic goals, given that member countries have different interests and perspectives. At the Commission's 2016 annual meeting, Moss-Christian highlighted the need to develop a harvest strategy, review conservation and management measures for key tunas such as Bigeye and Bluefin, mitigate bycatch and address the safety of commercial fishing boat observers who ensure Commission rules are being followed.

The children were handed over to the person asking least money from the authorities. The compensation was determined in descending English auctions, where the children were present. The lowest bidder became the child's foster-parent and was compensated with an annual amount equal to his bid. The foster-parents provided the child the housing, upbringing and education, but the children were often used as a child labour. Specially in the Finnish countryside the children sold in the auctions usually lived in a slavery-like conditions. They were also mistreated. Child auctions were prohibited in Sweden in 1918 and in Finland in 1923. Although, auctions were still organized in Finland until the late 1930s. The last known child auction was held in 1935. Some of the children were still living with their foster- parents in the 1940s. Among the notable people who were sold in the child auctions are the Swedish politician Fredrik Vilhelm Thorsson, who later became the Minister for Finance of Sweden, the Finnish politicians Eino Kujanpää and Jukka Lankila, and the Finnish author Joel Lehtonen. Similar practices were also carried out in other European countries, like the Verdingkinder institution in Switzerland.

The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. The barn is actually a T-shaped structure with a total of three levels. The longest portion of the building has two levels, ending on the south in a round stone structure that was originally a milk house. Perpendicular to this was a chicken coop. To the south of the chicken coop are two former silos made out of concrete block. The chicken coop extends over a drive, which ends at an apartment on the north end of the long portion. History Midway Barn was used most actively by Wright and his architectural apprentices in the \\"Taliesin Fellowship\\" (now the School of Architecture at Taliesin) from the time that the Fellowship began in 1932 until the end of the architect's life in 1959.Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer, Frank Lloyd Wright: Completed Buildings, volume 3, 1943-1959 (Taschen, 2009), p. 57. . Midway Barns were constructed mostly in 1938 and were named for their location which was midway between Taliesin and Hillside. Dairy and machine sheds were added in 1947. The barn at one time had \\"[T]he Wrights' personal horses, cows, pigs, sheep, chickens, rabbits, [and] an Afghan hound or two\\",Earl Nisbet, Taliesin Reflections: My Years Before, During, and After Living with Frank Lloyd Wright (Meridian Press, 2006), p. 45. but also had several living spaces, including one for a \\"sheepherder\\".Lois Davidson Gottlieb, A Way of Life: An Apprenticeship with Frank Lloyd Wright (Images Publishing Group Pty Ltd, 2001), p. 104. .

Canadian music producer Wolfenstein OS X's album End of World Rave (2015) and the Antifur record label are credited with having first defined the hardvapour sound. It is also related to vaportrap. Beginnings On 29 November 2015, Canadian vaporwave producer Wolfenstein OS X released End of World Rave, the earliest notable hardvapour release, via the Bandcamp label Dream Catalogue. The album featured music that intentionally opposed aspects that were typically associated with the vaporwave sound. In December 2015, Wolfenstein OS X formed Antifur, a label responsible for many of the hardvapour records that have been issued; in running the label, he goes under the moniker of a Ukrainian with poor English named Vladyk Predovitch.Chandler, Simon (21 October 2016). \\"Antifur Want to Shake Vaporwave Out of Its Meaningless Irony\\". Retrieved 12 March 2017. Todd Ledford, founder of the label HVRF Central Command explained: On 9 December 2015, producer Hong Kong Express, under the alias Sandtimer, released Vaporwave Is Dead also under Dream Catalogue, which announced the \\"death\\" of vaporwave and a \\"new era.\\" The album features a spoken word track with the lyrics, “Now, in the beginnings of the end of the world, vaporwave is dead. From now on, it will only be… the hardvapour.” Musical characteristics Common elements include thick synthesizer sounds, programmed drums, fast tempos, and influences of acid house, big beat, broken beat, gabber, speedcore, noise music, hard techno, industrial techno, hardstyle and drum 'n' bass.Arcand, Rob (12 July 2016). \\"Inside Hardvapour, an Aggressive, Wry Rebellion Against Vaporwave\\". THUMP. Vice Media. Retrieved 11 March 2017. The 56-track compilation album Hardvapour. by DJ VLAD, released worldwide via Antifur's Bandcamp page, showcases elements and influences from a variety of styles, such as techno, industrial music and trap. Hacking For Freedom by Wolfenstein OS X's pseudonym Flash Kostivich was characterised by journalist Matt Broomfield as a \\"unique sonic space somewhere between early Clicks and Cuts compilations and the Ghost in the Shell soundtrack.\\" Thump contributor Rob Arcand interprets the hardvapour sound as a rebellion against vaporwave that sometimes toys with elements of punk music. Examples such as \\"Humanoid Sound (гуманоид звук)\\" by Trende borrow the three-chord song structure of punk, while \\"Immortal\\" by DJ Alina features basslines distorted in a similar fashion to the works of Circle Jerks or Dead Kennedys. Arcand views hardvapour as somewhere between vaporwave and a genre journalist Adam Harper calls distroid, a style that was \\"hi-fi to the point of actively fetishizing the hi-frequency hisses and twinkles that lo-fi was unable to produce.\\" According to Arcand, in common with vaporwave, hardvapour uses similar music software tools \\"not out of any special fixation with them, but simply because they're now the cheapest and most accessible tools around.\\" Subcultural identity The hardvapour aesthetic is influenced by Eastern European culture and some of its producers are thought to be of Eastern European origin; the J-card of the Hardvapour. compilation album reveals that around a quarter of the producers included and involved were from Russia, Ukraine and Croatia. Other producers like Flash, DJ Alina, and Krokodil Hunter have falsely labeled themselves to be Ukrainian and Russian, which German critic Jens Balzer felt added a quirkiness to the hardvapour scene. Wolfenstein OS X has noted that one of the major goals of hardvapour was \\"globalization\\" and showcasing the true harsh cultures of not only Eastern European but also other nations. In contrasting the movement's identity to that of vaporwave Wolfenstein OS X stated: \\"The problem [of vaporwave] comes from the fact that it is all meaningless irony. We have sunk into this deep virtual plaza and have made a prison for ourselves made of softness. But this is not how the world is. If we want to change the world for better, we cannot escape into little fantasy world forever.

Any discussion of hardvapour is banned from the official subreddit for vaporwave. Hong Kong Express responded to this banning: \\"Some people can't take things with humour in seriously for some reason. It’s closer to Dr. Strangelove – a serious message with a dark and humorous slant.” According to Halzer, the use of false Eastern European identities by some producers have also garnered negative responses from many listeners; the listeners have deemed it as \\"cultural imperialist arrogance,\\" writing that the producers \\"mask themselves as people from poor, undemocratic, or even bourgeois-warped states, in order to be more interesting in this way.\\" As Wolfenstein OS X responded to these criticisms, \\"There were a lot of people who called what I did a mockery of those people, but I really wanted it to be the opposite—making it socially acceptable and almost aesthetically pleasing to experience this slang.\\" References 21st-century music genres Electronic music genres Vaporwave 2010s in music Indie music Microgenres ","title":"Hardvapour"},{"id":"53478660","text":"12 Bar Bruise is the debut studio album by Australian psychedelic rock band King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard.

Because Sextii Prifernii are not otherwise attested, Olli Salomies, in his monograph on the naming practices of the Early Roman empire, considers it \\"almost a certainty\\" that Geminus' name at birth was Rosius Sex.f.

She was the first woman to cover a Major League Baseball (MLB) All-Star Game (1973) and the first female journalist allowed into a baseball locker room (after the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Houston Astros at the Astrodome to win the pennant in 1974). Based in Houston for most of her career, Martini worked for radio and television stations in the city from the mid-1960s until shortly before her death. Early life Martini was born in Galveston, Texas, where her father was the owner of a theater. She was exposed to baseball as a young child; her uncle, Buck Fausett, was a professional baseball player, and she would often accompany him to ballparks. She was educated at Ursuline Academy, a local private school. Later, she attended Ball High School, the public high school in Galveston. For college, she went to Columbia, Missouri, where she studied for an associate degree in journalism from Stephens College. She got married and moved to Houston after that, but was soon divorced. Career By the 1960s, Martini worked for and then owned a Houston publication called FUN Magazine. Her broadcast career began in 1965, and she worked mostly for Houston stations, spending 14 years at KPRC Radio and also appearing on KPRC-TV, KHTV (Channel 39), and KULF Radio. She was the first woman in a major radio market to co- host a sports talk show (with Mike Edmonds on KPRC Radio, 1972-1979 and 1986-1991). For the first several years of Martini's career, no woman from the media had ever been admitted into a men's locker room in professional sports. At the Astrodome, women were also not allowed on the playing field or in the dining room. Late in the 1974 baseball season, after the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Houston Astros to win the National League pennant, Martini lined up with male reporters to enter the Dodgers locker room. Predictably, Martini was initially refused access. She asked to speak with Dodgers manager Walter Alston, and Alston allowed her to come into the locker room. Martini conducted interviews that day with Alston and with Dodgers players Steve Garvey and Jimmy Wynn. A lawsuit was later filed against MLB that established the rights of female reporters to enter baseball's locker rooms, but Martini was not involved in the suit. Martini had a long tenure in Houston, but in a 1975 interview with Sports Illustrated, she expressed disappointment at not getting a chance at a national broadcasting job: \\"What burns me is the networks are looking for women to accomplish something their men haven't done yet,\\" she says. \\"I'm not capable of doing a perfect game, but neither is any man.\\" In 1976, Martini interviewed with ABC to broadcast the station's backup game each week, but the network selected former MLB pitcher Bob Gibson. She asked some questions for a 1990 ESPN special, but she was not seen on camera. With her partner, Nelda Peña, Martini ran a public relations firm that promoted both sports-related and non-sports-related entities. Death Martini was diagnosed with brain cancer and underwent brain surgery in April 1989. She experienced partial paralysis on one side of her body after the procedure, but she hosted a radio show from the hospital the day after her surgery. In a January 1990 article in The Galveston Daily News, she was described as \\"doing fine now.\\" Martini's health took a turn for the worse around May 1993, and she died of cancer in July of that year. She was inducted into the Texas Radio Hall of Fame in 2015.

She became one of the first woman physicians associated with a large public hospital in the United States, and she established one of the first nursing assistant training programs in the country. A graduate of Oberlin College and the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania, Cleveland received postgraduate training in Philadelphia, Paris and London that was focused on obstetrics and gynecology and hospital administration. By 1872, she was the dean on the Woman's Medical College. Cleveland suffered from tuberculosis for the last several years of her life. Early life Cleveland was born Emeline Horton in Ashford, Connecticut, to Chauncey Horton and Amanda Chaffee Horton. Her paternal ancestors had been Puritans who came to the United States in the 1630s. Cleveland had eight siblings, six of them younger. When Cleveland was two years old, her family moved to a farm in Madison County, New York, where she received her schooling from tutors. Though Cleveland had aspirations of becoming a missionary that had started when she was a child, her father died when she was young, so she became a teacher in order to save enough money to attend college. In 1850, Cleveland enrolled at Oberlin College, graduating three years later. She had begun corresponding with Sarah Josepha Hale, who was the editor of a women's magazine known as Godey's Lady's Book. Hale was also secretary of a new organization known as the Pennsylvania Ladies' Missionary Society, and she told Cleveland about efforts at the Female Medical College of Pennsylvania (later known as the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania) to train women to serve as missionary physicians. Cleveland earned a medical degree after two years at the Female Medical College. While she was in medical school, Emeline had married a childhood friend of hers, Giles Butler Cleveland; he had gone to the Oberlin Theological Seminary to become a Presbyterian minister at the same time that she went off to Oberlin. The couple wanted to work as missionaries, but Giles became ill, eliminating the possibility of mission work. To support them, Emeline started a medical practice in Oneida Valley, New York. By late 1856, she was invited to teach anatomy courses at the Female Medical College of Philadelphia, so Cleveland and her husband moved back there. Career When the couple moved back to Philadelphia, Cleveland's husband was able to find a job as a teacher. A little over a year after their arrival, he became seriously ill again, and he was left partially paralyzed and out of work. Cleveland stayed at the Female Medical College until 1860 when physician colleague Ann Preston and several local Quaker women paid for Cleveland to go to Paris and London for further studies in obstetrics, gynecological surgery and hospital administration. Returning to Philadelphia in 1862, Cleveland became chief resident at the Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia, which Ann Preston had established while Cleveland was in Europe. The goal of the hospital was to provide patient care experience for medical students at the Woman's Medical College of Philadelphia, as they often faced discrimination in trying to gain clinical experiences at other hospitals. In 1872, Cleveland became the dean of the medical school when Preston died. Cleveland established training programs for nurses at the college, and she started one of the earliest programs to train nursing assistants. Her health was tenuous, and that forced her to step down as dean in 1874. In 1875, an article was published in a regional medical journal regarding Cleveland's performance of an ovariotomy in a patient who had been suffering from a cystic tumor of the ovary that had led to a large fluid collection within the abdomen.Peitzman, pp. 26-27. One of Cleveland's students wrote the journal article, making a concluding point that Cleveland's work was evidence that women could make good surgeons. Death In 1878, Cleveland was named a gynecologist for the Pennsylvania Hospital Department for the Insane, marking one of the first times that a woman had become a physician for a large public hospital. She died of tuberculosis later that year. She was buried next to Ann Preston at Fair Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia. She was survived by her husband and by a son, Arthur Horton Cleveland, who became a physician. Cleveland's legacy was that of a physician who combined medical acumen with femininity and a down-to- earth demeanor. These factors may have helped her succeed in a male-dominated field because she was not seen as trying to upset the social order between men and women.Peitzman, pp. 27-28. Mary Corinna Putnam Jacobi, an influential physician who attended the Female Medical College in the 1860s, said that Cleveland was \\"a woman of real ability... personal beauty, and grace of manner.\\" Further reading * Notes * References 1829 births 1878 deaths People from Ashford, Connecticut 19th- century deaths from tuberculosis Oberlin College alumni Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania alumni Women surgeons People from Madison County, New York American surgeons 19th-century American women physicians 19th-century American physicians Burials in Pennsylvania ","title":"Emeline Horton Cleveland"},{"id":"53478794","text":"Glenea pujoli is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

Initially, it was a dance band playing light music, and soon began performing beyond the school at local venues and on radio. In 1929, it began recording in styles recognizably influenced by American jazz. René Schmassmann took control of the group in 1932 and renamed it the Lanigiro Hot Players; the group toured widely throughout western Europe in the 1930s and recorded in Berlin.

The attack on Nixon's car was called, at the time, the \\"most violent attack ever perpetrated on a high American official while on foreign soil\\". Close to being killed while a couple of his aides were injured in the melee, Nixon ended up unharmed and his entourage managed to reach the U.S. embassy. The visit took place only months after the overthrow of Venezuelan dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez, who was awarded the Legion of Merit and later granted asylum by the United States, and the incident may have been orchestrated by the Communist Party of Venezuela. U.S. Navy Admiral Arleigh Burke mobilized fleet and Marine units to the region, compelling the Venezuelan government to provide full protection to Nixon for the remainder of the trip. The attack was denounced by all major Venezuelan presidential candidates standing in that year's election, except for the incumbent leader Admiral Wolfgang Larrazábal. Nixon was generally applauded in American press reports for his calm and adept handling of the incident and was feted with a \\"hero's welcome\\" on his return to the United States. His recollections of the attack form one of the \\"six crises\\" explored in his Six Crises book. Context Richard Nixon's carefully planned 1958 tour of South America has been described as one of the \\"most important United States foreign policy events in post-WWII Latin America\\". It was undertaken at a time of confused United States intra-hemispheric relations; the role of Latin American states in the emerging American grand strategy of containment was unclear and ill- defined. However, a recent worldwide drop in commodity prices that badly affected South American economies, coupled with increasing Soviet overtures in the western hemisphere, made President of the United States Dwight Eisenhower determine that a tour by a major United States functionary was necessary to demonstrate U.S. commitment to the region. Nixon retrospectively wrote that he was uninterested in taking the trip. The tour was to see Nixon visit every independent country in South America except Brazil and Chile. Brazil had been omitted from the itinerary as Nixon had visited that nation the previous year. The Chilean leadership, meanwhile, were scheduled to be out-of-the-country during the time period of Nixon's visit. Nixon was accompanied on his trip by his wife, Pat Nixon. =Early tour stops= mate at the Montevideo home of former Uruguayan president Luis Batlle Berres. Nixon began his tour in Uruguay, arriving at Carrasco International Airport at 9:00 a.m. on April 28. There, he was greeted by senior Uruguayan officials. According to an Associated Press report at the time, about 40 students protested on the street corner as Nixon's motorcade proceeded into Montevideo. In Montevideo, Nixon made an unscheduled appearance at the University of the Republic and was generally well received by students. According to Nixon, he decided to make the unannounced stop because he felt that average Uruguayans would be receptive towards him, while scheduled and published visits were likely to attract organized demonstrations. This proved to be the case, and when communists arrived and tried to distribute literature, the students tore up the pamphlets. The visit to Argentina was billed as the major stop of the trip and four days were allotted to the country, instead of the two slated for the other visits. In Buenos Aires, Nixon attended the presidential inauguration of Arturo Frondizi and spoke to several student and organized labor groups. The first serious trouble on the tour materialized in Lima, Peru. Nixon's scheduled appearance at the University of San Marcos saw a large crowd of student demonstrators awaiting his arrival. In an event foreshadowing his famous visit to the Lincoln Memorial to meet anti-war protesters some years later, Nixon waded directly into the crowd of demonstrators, attended by only two staff members. Over the next few minutes Nixon spoke with the students, however, a second faction of demonstrators soon began stoning the group, hitting one of Nixon's staff in the mouth and grazing the vice-president's neck. The vice-president then withdrew and a later round-table with student leaders was canceled. Returning to his hotel, Nixon and his staff had to push through demonstrators who had encamped outside, during which Nixon was struck in the face. Eisenhower cabled Nixon at his next stop, in Quito, Ecuador: Nixon, pictured here in Bogotá in 1958, was well-received during his stop in Colombia Nixon's final stop before Venezuela and Colombia saw generally receptive crowds. At Bolívar Square in Bogotá, he laid a wreath at the statue of Simón Bolívar before a crowd of about 1,000. An Associated Press report noted that there were some hecklers in the audience, but they amounted to \\"about 80 youths\\" and observed that \\"generally ... the Colombian crowds were friendly or enthusiastic\\". Tour in Venezuela = Background = Earlier in 1958, the disliked Venezuelan dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez had been overthrown in a popular uprising and had gone into exile in the United States. A military junta formed a caretaker government to rule the country until new elections could be held. Admiral Wolfgang Larrazábal, head of the governing junta, had announced his intention to stand in those elections; his candidacy was backed by a coalition of parties, including the Venezuelan Communist Party. The United States' decision to grant Pérez Jiménez asylum and to award him the Legion of Merit on 12 November 1954 combined to create a charged atmosphere leading up to Nixon's arrival. The Caracas municipal council even passed a resolution effectively declaring Nixon persona non grata. Prior to Nixon's arrival in Caracas, media reported on rumors that an attempt had been planned on the vice-president's life during his visit. The CIA station chief in Venezuela, meanwhile, urged that this leg of the trip be canceled. In an interview conducted after he retired from government service, Robert Amerson, then-press attache to the United States embassy in Venezuela, claims that the demonstrators who disrupted the Venezuela stop on the tour \\"had been bused down by the professional agitators and organizers\\" affiliated with the Communist Party of Venezuela. This view was one echoed in a report issued by William P. Snow, acting Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, who wrote that \\"the pattern of organization and of slogans in all cases points to Communist inspiration and direction, as do certain of the intelligence reports\\". Nixon, himself, also blamed Communist instigation. A Universal Newsreel at the time characterized it as \\"another of the well- planned campaigns of harassment\\" and a \\"communist-sparked onslaught\\". Venezuelan journalist Carlos Rangel has indicated the \\"Nixon carnival\\" was organized by the Venezuelan Communist Party as a way of demonstrating that it had the ability to \\"dominate the streets, that the Caracas masses were ready to be mobilized\\". = Arrival = Nixon, left, with Wolfgang Larrazábal, center Nixon arrived, via air, in Caracas on May 13, 1958. According to a U.S. Secret Service report of the incident, a crowd of demonstrators at the airport \\"purposely disrupted ... [the] welcoming ceremony by shouting, blowing whistles, waving derogatory placards, throwing stones, and showering the Nixons with human spittle and chewing tobacco\\". Reporting for the New York Herald Tribune, Earl Mazo wrote that \\"Venezuelan troops and police seemed to evaporate. The vice-president and the whole official party literally had to fight their way to cars behind a thin but sturdy phalanx of U.S. Secret Service agents\\". Admiral Wolfgang Larrazábal, leader of the ruling junta, was reportedly concerned heavy-handed policing would alienate his base The original itinerary had Nixon moving from the airport to the National Pantheon of Venezuela where he was to lay a wreath at the tomb of Simón Bolívar. However, a United States naval attache sent ahead with the wreath reported a crowd that had assembled at the Pantheon had attacked him and torn up the wreath. At this point it was decided to proceed directly to the U.S. embassy. = Attack = For the first time on the South America tour, the Nixons traveled in closed-top cars, as opposed to convertibles, a decision later credited with saving their lives. As the Nixons traveled by motorcade through Caracas, the vehicle carrying the Vice-President was slowed to a crawl by heavy traffic. A crowd used the stoppage to throng Nixon's vehicle, stoning it and banging the windows with their fists. Nixon was protected by twelve United States Secret Service agents, some of whom were injured in the melee. According to the Secret Service, Venezuelan police declined to intervene to clear the crowd. When the mob began rocking the car back and forth in an attempt to overturn it, U.S. Secret Service agents, believing the vice- president's life was in jeopardy, drew their firearms and prepared to begin shooting into the crowd. In an act described as \\"the kind of presence of mind for which battlefield commanders win medals\\", Nixon ordered Secret Service agent-in-charge Jack Sherwood to hold fire and shoot only on his orders; no shots were ultimately fired. Nixon would later recount that Venezuelan Foreign Minister Óscar García Velutini, who was traveling with him, was \\"close to hysterics\\" and kept repeating \\"this is terrible, this is terrible\\". According to Nixon, Velutini explained the police inaction was because the communists \\"helped us overthrow Pérez Jiménez and we are trying to find a way to work with them\\". Nixon's longtime secretary, Rose Mary Woods, was injured by flying glass when the windows of the car in which she was riding, following Nixon, were smashed. Vernon Walters, then a mid-ranking U.S. Army officer serving as Nixon's translator, would end up with a \\"mouthful of glass\\", and Velutini was also hit by shards of the limousine's supposedly \\"shatter-proof\\" glass. Nixon's car, even though it was equipped with shatter-proof glass, was unable to withstand the pummeling it received from the crowd Two different accounts explain how Nixon's car was ultimately able to escape the mob and continue to the embassy. According to one version of events, the U.S. press corps' flatbed truck, accompanying the motorcade, was used to clear a path through the crowd. In Nixon's remembrance of the incident, Associated Press photographer Hank Griffin at one point had to use his camera to beat back a protester who tried to mount the truck. According to a second account, soldiers of the Venezuelan Army arrived and cleared the traffic, thereafter moving the mob back at bayonet-point to allow Nixon's car to pass. = Embassy = Shortly after the Nixons arrived at the embassy, the Venezuelan army surrounded and fortified the chancellery, reinforcing the small U.S. Marine guard force. Their assistance had earlier been requested by the U.S. ambassador. That afternoon, members of the ruling junta arrived at the embassy and lunched with Nixon. The next morning, representatives of Venezuela's major labor unions came to the embassy and requested an audience with Nixon, which was granted. The union leaders apologized for events of the preceding day and disclaimed involvement, though, United States Air Force officer Manuel Chavez – at the time attached to the embassy – wrote in 2015 that \\"they probably were the instigators or at least encouraged the actions\\". = U.S. mobilization = Upon learning of the incident, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke ordered the airlift of elements of the 2nd Marine Division and the 101st Airborne Division to staging areas in Puerto Rico and Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The aircraft carrier , along with eight destroyers and two amphibious assault ships, were ordered to put to sea towards Venezuela. The U.S. mobilization was code-named \\"Operation Poor Richard\\". A fleet of 12 ships centered on , pictured here in 1952, was ordered to Venezuela once news of the attack on Nixon reached Washington According to U.S. officials at the time, the forces mobilized were being readied to enter Venezuela to \\"cooperate with the Venezuelan government\\", though later accounts suggest President Eisenhower was preparing to \\"invade Venezuela\\" should Nixon suffer further indignity. Privately, Eisenhower was reportedly furious at the attack on Nixon and, at one point, told his staff \\"I am about ready to go put my uniform on\\". Nixon was shocked after learning about the mobilization and wondered why they were not consulted, but later found out that communications between Caracas and Washington had been cut for a critical period immediately after the riot that afternoon. In response to the movement of American military forces into the region, Admiral Larrazábal pledged the Nixon party would be \\"protected fully\\" thereafter. =Return to the United States= Additional activities were canceled, and Nixon departed Caracas the next morning, seven hours early. His motorcade to the airport was protected by a major deployment of Venezuelan Army infantry and armored forces in the capital. Nixon described having taken the same route as before, whose streets were empty and heavily patrolled after the whole area had been tear- gassed. American reaction Eisenhower ordered that Nixon should receive a \\"hero's welcome\\" on his return; all U.S. government employees in Washington, D.C. were given the day off work to turn-out for the arrival of the vice- president. Nixon deplaned before \\"a cheering crowd of 10,000\\" that included the congressional leadership and ambassadors from most Latin American countries. Eisenhower personally greeted Nixon at the airport and the two then traveled to the White House along a route lined by 100,000 people. Life credited Nixon for his \\"courage\\" and said \\"his coolness had been remarkable\\". According to Pathé News, Nixon reflected \\"calm, rather than concern.\\" For weeks after the attack, Nixon received standing ovations \\"wherever he went ... a new high in his life\\". By contrast, The New Republic claimed the attack was a hoax set up to help Nixon's chances in the 1960 U.S. presidential election. All twelve agents of Nixon's Secret Service detail received the Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service from Eisenhower at Nixon's request. Venezuelan reaction Rómulo Betancourt greets Larrazábal after taking oath in the National Congress John F. Kennedy visit to Venezuela with Rómulo Betancourt In Venezuela, all major presidential candidates standing in the 1958 general election denounced the attack except for the incumbent president, Admiral Larrazábal. After Nixon's departure, Larrazábal said that he would have joined the protests if he were a student. Although receiving strong backing by the communists, Larrazábal lost the election to Rómulo Betancourt. During the 1961 visit of U.S. President John F. Kennedy to Venezuela, anti- American violence also broke out, however, a repeat of the 1958 attack was avoided. President Betancourt pre-deployed significant Venezuelan military forces into Caracas in advance of Kennedy's arrival and ordered the preventive arrest of suspected ringleaders. All ten miles of the highway Kennedy was scheduled to travel from the airport, the same highway traveled by Nixon, were closed effective the day before Kennedy's arrival. A 2013 editorial on the attack published by the Bolivarian radio station Alba Ciudad disputed the characterization of the incident, explaining that, \\"no one forced him [Nixon] to stay on Venezuelan soil, no one had him abducted, no one was blocking him or holding him in the country. To the contrary, people asked him to leave!\\" Significance Pathé News, at the time, described the assault as \\"the most violent attack ever perpetrated on a high American official while on foreign soil\\". Nixon, pictured here 14 years after the attack, was deeply affected by his experiences in Caracas Various sources describe the attack as one that nearly led to Nixon's death and, though it is generally agreed he acted with remarkable composure throughout, the incident had a lasting impact on him. In his first book, Six Crises, Nixon wrote of the experience as one of the titular crises with great impact on his life. Every year on the anniversary of the attack, Nixon would \\"privately celebrate\\" with Vernon Walters. Nixon would favor Walters for the rest of his career, eventually appointing him Deputy Director of Central Intelligence. On the eve of Walters' retirement from government service, in 1991, Nixon explained his longtime patronage of the general, writing him that \\"you and I have faced death together and that gives us a special bond\\". The hardening of Nixon's attitude toward Latin America, which he came to \\"equate with violence and irrationality\\", has been attributed to his experience of the attack. Some believe this change of mood foreshadowed his subsequent support for covert U.S. actions directed in support of dictatorial regimes in the region. In fact, he would later privately list several nations whose populations, he believed, were too immature for democratic government and would be better administered by authoritarian regimes, specifically citing France, Italy, and all of Latin America \\"except for Colombia\\". The incident has been credited with first making American policymakers aware of growing popular resentment to U.S. policies in Latin America. By the end of 1958, the U.S. National Security Council would list \\"yankeephobia\\" as a key challenge to U.S. interests in Latin America.

He was named the Brazilian Horse of the Year of 2013/2014, having won all eight starts that year with several track records to his credit. In July 2014, he was sold to new owners and shipped to America but came down with a life- threatening bout of laminitis. After intensive treatment, he was finally able to return to the race track a year later, with mixed results. Late in 2016, he was sold again, this time to Calumet Farm for use as a breeding stallion. However, his trainer Richard Mandella convinced the owners to keep the horse active for another year and Bal a Bali responded by winning the Frank E. Kilroe Mile and Shoemaker Mile Stakes. He is the second survivor of laminitis to return and win a Grade I race (the first being Lady Eli in the 2016 Flower Bowl), marking significant progress in the treatment of the disease. Background Bal a Bali is a dark bay stallion who was bred by Haras Santa Maria de Araras, which is owned by Brazilian banker Julio Bozano. Bal a Bali is sired by Put It Back, a stakes winning son of Honour and Glory. Put It Back became a leading sire in Florida and also has sired multiple winners in Brazil where Bozano had arranged for him to stand during the southern hemisphere's breeding season. As a descendant of the relatively rare In Reality sire line that traces back through Man o' War to the Godolphin Arabian, Put It Back is an outcross for most mares. Bal a Bali is out of the stakes-winning mare In My Side, who was bought by Bozano at a dispersal sale in Brazil. The resulting foal, named Bal a Bali by Bozano's wife, was a well-built colt who was calm and easy to handle. He was sold as a yearling to Alvaro Novis, a successful Brazilian businessman. He was originally trained by Dulcino Guignoni, who had previously trained Brazilian Triple Crown winners Virginie (1998) and Be Fair (2000). Racing career At age two, Bal a Bali won three of four races, all held at the Hipódromo da Gávea in Rio de Janeiro. He won his debut on February 2, 2013, raced at a distance of 1000m (about 5 furlongs), by lengths. He followed up with wins in the Classico Jose Calmon on March 2 and the Group III Mario de Azevedo Ribeiro on March 31 before suffering his first loss in the Group II Conde de Herzberg on May 26. =2013/2014: three-year-old season= Bal a Bali started his three-year-old campaign on September 14, 2013 in the Leiloes Jockey Club Brasileiro - Versao Potros, run at a distance of 1600m (about 1 mile), and won by lengths in a time of 1:33.37 on soft turf. He next won the Ernani De Freitas on October 26 and the Group III Julio Capua on December 1. On January 12, he won his first Group I race, the Estado do Rio de Janeiro, which is the first leg of the Brazilian Triple Crown. His time of 1:31.36 for the 1600m was not only a track record, it was also one of the fastest times ever run at the distance. On February 16, Bal a Bali returned to win the second leg of the Triple Crown, the Francisco Eduardo de Paula Machado, in a time of 1:59.25 for the distance of 2,000m. He then completed the Triple Crown by winning the Grande Premio Cruzeiro do Sul on March 16. His time of 2:23.25 for the distance of 2,400m (about 12 furlongs) was a new track record. Bal a Bali rounded out his three-year-old season with wins in the Group II Doutor Frontin on May 11 and the Group I Grande Prêmio Brasil on June 8. The latter victory gave Bal a Bali an automatic berth in the Breeders' Cup Turf as part of the Breeders' Cup Challenge \\"Win and You're In\\" series. Bal a Bali was named the Brazilian Champion Three-Year-Old Colt and Horse of the Year of 2013/2014. =Laminitis= In July 2014, Bal a Bali was sold for $1.5 million to Fox Hill Farm, owned by Rick Porter, and Siena Farm. He was shipped to a quarantine facility in Miami and arrived with a scrape on his hind leg. A veterinarian was called in and detected signs of impending laminitis, a hoof condition that causes serious pain and is a leading cause of death in horses. The horse was quickly moved to Palm Beach Equine Clinic, where early and aggressive action proved to be the key to the horse's survival. Dr Vernon Dryden of Rood & Riddle Equine Hospital said that Bal a Bali had full-blown laminitis: the coffin bone was displaced and had rotated down and away from the wall of the hoof. Treatments included use of a cold water spa (cryotherapy) and injection of several doses of stem cells into the bone marrow. Bal a Bali developed a large abscess on his foot that Dryden opened and then treated with sterile maggots to prevent sepsis. Bal a Bali also had issues with his kidneys and dorsal colitis that required further care. \\"He had a gamut of issues and was a pretty sick boy for a while,\\" said Dryden. \\"He was definitely a lucky guy to get through it.\\" By September, Bal a Bali had recovered enough to be sent from Miami to Siena Farm in Kentucky. His handlers continued with the spa treatment and were soon able to turn the horse out for brief periods to forage for grass. A vibration plate was also used to help restore circulation in the hoof. Over the next months, his handlers gradually increased the amount of exercise to build up muscle while regrowing the hoof. He was first put on a walker, then had weight added, then finally started light jogging on a nearby training track. =2015: five-year-old season= Bal a Bali finally returned to the racetrack on May 9, 2015 after an absence of nearly 11 months in the Grade III American Stakes at Santa Anita. Racing behind the early pace, Bal a Bali squeezed between horses to find racing room in the stretch, then drew off to win by a length from Talco. \\"He has worked so good in the mornings, so I was pretty confident,\\" said jockey Flavien Prat. \\"He just repeated his works today. I wasn't really surprised. He was the champion in Brazil, so he can be the champion here. Why not?\\" Bal a Bali made his next start on June 15 in the Grade I Shoemaker Mile, where he was moving well around the turn and looked like a possible winner. However, he flattened in the stretch and finished fifth behind Talco. Mandella subsequently detected a small bone chip in one of his ankles, but the condition was not serious. Bal a Bali returned on August 23 in the Del Mar Handicap, where he finished eighth. On October 30, Mandella entered him in an allowance optional claiming race at Del Mar, and Bal a Bali responded with a -length victory. He completed the year by finishing second to Midnight Storm in the Seabiscuit Handicap. =2016: six-year-old season= Bal a Bali had a disappointing six-year-old campaign, going winless in five starts. He finished third in the San Gabriel Stakes on January 2, 2016, third in the Frank E. Kilroe Mile on March 12 and third again in the San Francisco Mile on April 30. On May 29, he finished fourth in the Charles Whittingham Stakes and then finished eighth in the Gold Cup at Santa Anita on June 25 in his first start on the dirt. =2017: seven- year-old season= Bal a Bali was originally scheduled to retire to stud at Calumet Farm in 2017 but Mandella had other ideas. \\"I gave him some time off, and they thought, if he didn't train well, he could go to stud,\\" Mandella said. \\"But he's training too good to go to stud.\\" Instead, Bal a Bali was entered in the Group I Frank E. Kilroe Mile on March 11, 2017 where he was the 9-1 longshot in a highly competitive field of six. Bal a Bali raced in the middle of the pack during the early going, then gradually closed ground in the stretch to win by a head over What a View, who had won the 2016 renewal of the race. Bal a Bali became one of the first horses to come back from laminitis and win a Grade I race. Bal a Bali finished fifth in his next start, the Woodford Reserve Turf Classic on a rain-softened course at Churchill Downs on May 6. On June 3, he returned to win the Shoemaker Mile at Santa Anita with a powerful closing run. \\"He's had some problems in his life and overcame them,\\" said Mandella. \\"He's very fortunate to have had two sets of owners that are the best in the business and were willing to do what's right for him, and the results of that are what we saw today.\\" On August 20, Bal a Bali made what would prove to be his final start in the Del Mar Mile Handicap, finishing sixth. He was next being pointed to the Breeders' Cup Mile but Mandella felt he was not training at a high enough level so the decision was made to retire him. \\"He's had problems ever since he came here and he's dealt with them and had success – success beyond expectations\\", said Mandella. Retirement Bal a Bali was retired to stud at Calumet Farm, where he stood his first season in 2018 for a fee of $15,000. His first foals will be of racing age in 2021. Pedigree Bal a Bali is inbred 4 × 4 to the mare Gonfalon, meaning she appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

She has been called “one of the greatest strike leaders in U.S. history.” Early life and family Canty was born in 1933 in rural St. Stephens Alabama. She later moved with two children to San Diego, California where she worked as a cook and a housekeeper. In 1961, Canty moved to Las Vegas, Nevada. In 1972 she took as a job as a maid at Thunderbird Hotel. After her husband’s death in 1975, she was left to support eight children on her own income. Canty found work first as a janitor at Clark County School District and later as a maid in private homes. Eventually, she found work at Maxim Hotel and Casino (later the Westin Las Vegas), which provided her and her children with access to health insurance. Labor organizing in Las Vegas It was during her employment at Maxim Hotel that she became involved in the union movement. She joined the Las Vegas Hotel and Culinary Workers Union Local 226 and was elected to their executive board. In 1984, Canty was part of planning a walkout strike of Las Vegas casino workers who demanded improved conditions and insurance benefits. The strike lasted for 75 days. In 1990, she was elected president of the Las Vegas Hotel and Culinary Workers Union Local 226. As president, she led a number of publicized strikes In 1991, Canty led a strike of 550 culinary workers from New Frontier Hotel and Gambling Hall in protest of unfair labor conditions. The strike was the longest labor strike in American History and lasted for six and a half years. See Canty's interview with Claytee D. White in 1998 about picketing for employment rights. Canty helped to found the Culinary Training Academy of Las Vegas in 1993. The Academy is still in operation and trains several thousand people every year for work in the hospitality industry. Their mission is “to reduce poverty and eliminate unemployment by providing employability and vocational skills to youth, adults, and displaced workers.” Its founding has been noted as one of Canty’s crowning achievements. Hattie Canty is known for her work fighting for a living wage as well as her advocacy for minority involvement in the labor movement and workforce advancement. She organized a diverse labor union of workers from 84 different countries. Canty made the observation that “coming from Alabama, this seemed like the civil rights struggle…the labor movement and the civil rights movement, you cannot separate the two of them.\\" Hattie Canty died in Las Vegas in 2012.

Byzantine glass objects highly resembled their earlier Roman counterparts during the fourth and early fifth centuries CE in both form and function. Over the course of the fifth century CE, Byzantine glass blowers, based mostly in the area of Syria and Palestine, developed a distinct Byzantine style. While glass vessels continued to serve as the primary vehicles for pouring and drinking liquid, glassware for lighting, currency and commodity weights, window panes, and glass tesserae for mosaics and enamels also surged in popularity. Following the Arab conquests of the seventh century CE, large quantities of glass were imported from the Levant, which continued to produce raw and manufactured glass.Jenkins, Marylin, \\"Islamic Glass: A Brief History,\\" The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, New Series Vol.44 No.2 (Autumn 1986), 6. Scholars once believed that glassware was an expensive luxury good reserved for the upper strata of society, however, recent archaeological excavations have unearthed a considerable quantity of unadorned glassware intended for lower-class residents.Lightfoot, Christopher, \\"Glass Finds at Amorium,\\" Dumbarton Oaks Papers, Vol.59 (2005), 175. Production Chemical analyses of Byzantine glassware have demonstrated that Byzantine glass was composed of the same basic materials as Roman glass—combining sand-derived silica, a fluxing agent, and lime, as well as various coloring agents. Roman and Byzantine glass-making was divided into two phases. The first, called \\"primary glass- making\\" involved the conversion of sand and stabilizer into raw glass. Separate workshops would then re-heat the glass and shape it into an object, in a phase referred to as \\"secondary glass-making\\". Although there is considerable archaeological evidence establishing primary glass-making sites, secondary glass-making sites remain difficult to pinpoint. The largest number of glass production sites from the Early Byzantine period have been unearthed in Syria and Palestine, as well as Egypt. Glass factories have also been discovered in Greece (Corinth, Thessoloniki) and Asia Minor.Antonaras, Anastassios, \\"The Production and Uses of Glass in Byzantine Thessaloniki,\\" in New Light on Old Glass, ed. by Christopher Entwistle and Liz James, (London: The British Museum, 2013), 189-198. A chemical analysis of sixth-century Byzantine glass weights demonstrated that glass was also manufactured in Carthage and along the Danube River.Schibille, Nadine, Meek, Andrew, Benguez, Tobias, Entwistle, Chris, Avisseau-Broustet Mathilde, Da Mota, Henrique, Gratuze, Bernard, \\"Comprehensive Chemical Characterization of Byzantine Glass Weights,\\" PLoS One Vol.11, no.12 (Dec.2016). e0168289. Literary sources refer to glass-making sites in Constantinople, Emesa (Homs, Syria), and various Egyptian towns. Labor Though some towns were home to glass-maker guilds, most Byzantine glass-makers were independent entrepreneurs. Glass-workers could be either male or female. An extant glass-making contract from Armenia mentions a woman glass manufacturer.Stern, E. Marianne, \\"Glass Producers in Late Antique and Byzantine Papyri,\\" in New Light on Old Glass, ed. by Christopher Entwistle and Liz James, (London: The British Museum, 2013), 84-85. Glass-making styles and techniques by object Glass vessel shapes in the Byzantine period did not deviate greatly from those of the high Roman period. Beginning in the late fifth century, glassblowers in the near east produced increasingly larger vessels. They also introduced the folded, stemmed foot. In the sixth and seventh centuries Byzantine glass vessels typically features a delicate u-shaped mouth. A number of \\"classical\\" Roman glassware shapes were phased out by the fifth century including: bowls, flat- bottomed cups and beakers, and footed wine jugs featuring trefoil mouths.Stern, E. Marianne, Roman Byzantine, and Early Medieval Glass 10 BCE-700 CE : Ernesto Wolf Collection, (Ostfildern-Ruit: Haje Cantz,2001), 261-263. A major innovation of the Byzantine period was the invention of the glass lamp. Glass lamps are first attested in the first half of the fourth century CE in Palestine, where they began to replace the clay lamps in use at the time as they were much more efficient. By the middle of the fifth century their use was rapidly spreading westward. Initially these lamps were shaped just like drinking vessels, though the number of shapes expanded to seventeen over the course of the sixth and seventh centuries.Stern, E. Marianne, Roman Byzantine, and Early Medieval Glass 10 BCE-700 CE : Ernesto Wolf Collection, (Ostfildern- Ruit: Haje Cantz,2001), 262. Following the \\"Triumph of Orthodoxy\\" in 843 CE, enamel relief icons became the predominant form of iconography in Byzantium.Pentcheva, Bissera V. \\"The Performative Icon, \\" The Art Bulletin, vol.88 no.4 (Dec.2006), 631-632. The best-known example is the Michael the Archangel enamel from the treasury of St. Mark's Basilica in Venice. Silver staining Byzantine glass silver-stained bracelet, dated 1100–1400, on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Similar bracelets have been found throughout the Byzantine empire.Pilosi, Lisa, Whitehouse, David, \\"Early Islamic and Byzantine Silver Stain,\\" in New Light on Old Glass, ed. by Christopher Entwistle and Liz James, (London: The British Museum, 2013), 334. In the middle Byzantine period, Byzantine glass-makers adopted silver-staining techniques from the Arab world. Silver-stained glass is created by applying a metallic compound, mixed with a \\"carrier\\" of clay or ochre to the surface of the glass object, then the glass is fired below the softening point of the glass. This process results in the breakdown of the smeared compound and its transition into the body of the glass object, creating a \\"stained\\" effect. Depending on the makeup of the compound and the \\"carrier\\" this process can lead to a wide array of colors. While the Arabs began creating silver-stained glass objects in the late eighth century in Egypt, the first Byzantine silver- stained object has been dated to the ninth century. The most common items featuring Byzantine silver-stain are simple glass bracelets, dating from the tenth to thirteenth centuries, and being discovered across the Byzantine world, from Greece to Anatolia. The most famous example of Byzantine silver- staining is the interior inscription of the beautiful San Marco bowl, dated to the \\"Macedonian Renaissance\\" of the tenth century. Several fragments of silver-stained window glass have been discovered. Although silver staining was practiced by the Byzantines, silver-stained works were not as ubiquitous in Byzantium as they were to become in late Medieval Europe. However, the widespread use of silver-staining in Byzantium could in part explain the transmission of silver-stain technique from the Arab world to Western Europe.Pilosi, Lisa, Whitehouse, David, \\"Early Islamic and Byzantine Silver Stain,\\" in New Light on Old Glass, ed. by Christopher Entwistle and Liz James, (London: The British Museum, 2013), 329-337.

Years later, first in 1784 and again in 1786, Lynch petitioned the General Assembly of Virginia for a charter to establish a town on the bluffs above the ferry upon land Lynch had inherited from an older brother. The 1786 petition was granted and the town of Lynchburg was founded. Lynch freed his own slaves during his lifetime and consistently supported the antislavery movement.

The sounds to be synchronized could be from the words of a narrator, the reading of a score by an orchestra conductor (or by a musician soloist), or shooting up devices with noises-effects;. But always by mechanical procedures, and with live sound by interpreters in the room (it was still a decade away for sound cinema). It was also known as Ciné-desk (Ciné-pupitre) in certain countries. But in reality, under the same name are called, over time, three different things: A) Firstly, the original synchronized reading desk, 1921, namely, an isolated device for reading texts or music, for a single user (although this may be an orchestra conductor who, since reading it, controls the complete template of instrumentalists) adjusted by an engine in synchronization with the projected images of the films. B) Soon after, in 1922-23, the synchro-ciné is now becoming a complete synchronization system, in which the reading desk is only one of the many elements around another central device, the control band, which can automatically trigger various 'noise' devices (Ciné-bruiteurs) or 'noise-makers' (also designed and incorporated into the system in the patent), shoot piano players, gramophones, and various desks that are needed, up to a maximum of, it seems, 9 devices. The proof of the change of orientation in the machinery and final objectives is the fact that, although the reading desks remain a regular part of the system; however it is already perfectly possible to perform a performance without using, at all, the reading desks (only with the capacity of the central distributor, and the connected sound devices). They also form part of the system the various procedures and methods that it registers to improve and facilitate the use of its synchronization system (the Delacommune system), over time. And c) later, it gave name to a production and distribution company of the films realized with this device (and directed by the own Delacommune). Among others, \\"ElDorado\\", by L'Herbier; the \\"Danse Macabre\\" by Dudley Murphy or the Ballet mécanique, by Léger. With a trajectory based on documentaries, this production company had a moment of boom at the beginning of sound cinema. as this procedure and device proved to be very suitable for the synchronization of voices in dubbing (the so-called 'band rhythm'), and used until very recently by the professionals of said specialty. However, Delacommune (and his company) it ended up falling into ruin and had to be subject to a special campaign of help by his fellow inventors for their mere subsistence.  The first audiovisual mixer  link=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Delacommune_synchronized_control_system_at_full_capacity.jpg The original 1921 device consisted of a reading device supplied with an aperture at which a paper text \\"that unfolded before the reader, by small shakes, on which was inscribed the oral accompaniment of the film. Each line corresponded to the projection time of a number of determined [s] and was in the center of the reference during the projection of these frames. In other words, the fixed reference allowed the reader to know in each instant the phrase of the text to say corresponding to the projection or the conductor of the appropriate musical fragment\\", say Delacommune himself in his patent. Once the paper-band was prepared, the various mismatches common to the time from multiple causes (lack of electrical current, mechanical problems, etc.) could be solved, on the fly, in two ways. Or the speed of the control band was set at the desk ( or the distributor) or by a mechanism that the orchestra conductor was placed in the hand, slightly vary the speed of the images. But this system also had the potential to work in another way: firing directly from its paper-band orders to the various notes of a pianola, or shooting up effects and devices of noises or records previously prepared for this purpose. It is this potentiality of automatic adjustment (once the control-band is properly recorded) that makes it a mechanical precedent to the current audiovisual mixes tables,and, perhaps, of the MIDI systems ( the digital control of musical instruments). It was not the only device of the so-called synchronization desks or synchronized reading of the time, an advance that the film industry of the moment was looking forward to, as it offered movies with live music, including large symphony orchestras in the first class halls (Cinema-Palaces) or Theater-Cinemas. Delacommune himself says in the magazines of the time: \\"One immediately understands the interest of such an apparatus. Of a little expensive manufacture, with a safe operation, its use is very indicated in all the places where the words must accompany a projection. One can foresee the happy consequences in teaching, in filmed lectures, in innovations (theater-filmed, novel-movies spoken, et cetera). Shortly after, the German industry counted with the Musikchronometer, of Carl Blum for the same thing, an analog device although with different mechanism, and which was used with satisfaction by the participants (among them, Hindemith) in the Darmstad Music encounters since 1927.

The museum is located close to Turku Cathedral in the historical city centre of Turku on the southwest coast of Finland. It is the only museum devoted to music in Finland. The museum houses a wide collection of historical music instruments from around the world. The archives of the museum include documents (sheet music, manuscripts, recordings, photographs, concert programmes, etc.) The museum was first founded during the 1920s as a seminar for the Department of Musicology at Åbo Akademi University, and has later developed into its own department. The Museum is currently organised and funded by the Åbo Akademi Foundation. The current building was built and opened in 1968 and it was designed by architect Woldemar Baeckman.  General information  The museum consists of two primary exhibitions: the instrument collection and the Sibelius exhibition. The instrument collections circles around the concert hall of the museum, The Sibelius Hall, and continues to the second floor downstairs. The Sibelius exhibition is located at the furthest left corner seen from the ticket counter. The museum also organises thematic exhibitions. In 2018, these exhibitions are \\"Sibbe50\\" and \\"A cantata for the doctors – Music at academic ceremonies\\". \\"´Sibbe50\\" celebrates the architecture of Woldemar Baeckman and the 50th anniversary of the current museum building. The exhibition \\"A cantata for the doctors – Music at academic\\" ceremonies covers music performed at conferment ceremonies in Finnish universities. The Sibelius Museum also organises concerts at the museum, of which the most notable is the museum's own concert series, the Wednesday series that has been organised since 1968. In addition to these concerts, there are also other concerts organised at the museum. The programme of the concert varies depending on the performer, but mostly the music played at The Sibelius Museum is focused on jazz, folk music and classical chamber music. Details of the facade The archives of The Sibelius Museum dates back to the collections of professor Otto Andersson of the Musicological Department at Åbo Akademi University. The archives contain material from several different aspects of musical life in Finland, such as manuscripts, photographs and recordings. There are additionally several special collections in the archives. These collections include an extensive collection about Jean Sibelius, the Otto Andersson archival collection and the archive of the Musical Society of Turku. In addition to the exhibitions and the archives, there are also a couple of auditoriums and classrooms in the premises of the museum. For instance, the auditoriums Brahe and Flora that have been named after the student choirs of Åbo Akademi University, Brahe Djäknar and Florakören.  History  A grand piano in the Sibelius Hall = Time before the museum: Pehr Kalm and the botanical garden = At the site of The Sibelius Museum, the botanical garden of the Royal Academy of Turku (Swedish: Kungliga Akademien I Åbo, Finnish: Kuninkaallinen Turun Akatemia) was located. Pehr Kalm, a pupil of Carl von Linné, founded the garden in 1757. In the garden, he planted plants from his trips to North America and Russia. After the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, the only plant that survived was an Oak tree that stands between the bank of the river Aura and the current museum building. After the fire, printer Christian Ludvig Hjelt bought the site of the garden in 1831 and built a couple of wooden houses on the plot. = Åbo Akademi University = In 1923, Ellen and Magnus Dahlström donated the site of the garden to the Åbo Akademi Foundation in a will. Attempts to restore the garden to its original state were made during the 1930s, during which Justus Montell aimed at planting his collections next to the oak from Kalm's era. After he died in 1954 the attempts were ended, which lead to the decaying of the garden and demolitions of the houses built by Hjelt. = Otto Andersson as the founder of the Musicological Department and Archives = Further details on the wall The foundations of the proper historical music museum were already made in 1926, when Otto Andersson was granted the professorship of the recently established Department of Musicology and Folklore at Åbo Akademi University. The ship-owner Robert Mattson donated the necessary funds to fund the professorship and to purchase materials for the collection and the seminar. Also, Mattson's son, Curt, had donated a notable collection of instruments from all around the world for the collections of professor Andersson. The original idea behind the collections was, however, to form a seminar for the Department of Musicology that would have as large of a library as possible. = The Museum receives its current name = Before the year 1949, The Sibelius Museum did not yet have a proper name, and it was simply known as \\"The historical music collections of Åbo Akademi University\\". In the late 1940s, an exhibition about the composer Jean Sibelius was organised. There were several items placed in the exhibition varying from sheet music to letters and manuscripts. Some journalist miscalled the exhibition \\"The Sibelius Museum\\", which aroused controversy between professor Andersson and the rector of Åbo Akademi University G.O. Rosenqvist. To avoid any further confusion about the exhibition, professor Andersson sent a letter to the composer, in which he asked a formal permission to use the name of Sibelius in official contexts. The composed replied in 16 January 1949 with the following words:After the name change, the museum received its first permanent premises in the house that currently works as the restaurant Hus Lindman. In the manor at Piispankatu 15, \\"The Sibelius Museum\\" had seven rooms in use, to which the collections and the administrative areas were placed. At the same time, new acquisitions were increased. For example, Andersson travelled with these purposes in America during the 1950s. The years in this building turned out to be long and hard, and hopes for an exclusive building for the museum were arisen. = The planning of the current building = Towards the end of the 1950s, several discussions were made between the city of Turku and Åbo Akademi University to build a joint museum about Jean Sibelius and Wäinö Aaltonen. The idea was put forward with the thought of using the site of the garden from Kalm's era as the base for the museum. This joint venture, however, dissolved and only the plans to build The Sibelius Museum advanced. Regardless of this, the city of Turku still funded the project. Architect Woldemar Baeckman was during the 1960s assigned to design the building for the museum for Åbo Akademi University. In his original plans, he had planned a separate wing for the choir activities of the university. Before the final plans, a couple of investigations were made in 1963 and 1966. The conclusion of these investigations was to give up this thought of building a separate wing and the focus was put on the main building. During the autumn of 1966, the final plans were finished and during the next year, the construction work started. The construction of the building was completed in February 1968, during which the building was put in use. Architectural design The Atrium of The Sibelius Museum The building is a notable example of the Brutalist concrete architecture of its time, though Baeckman's earlier architecture was more classically modernist in style, most notably the extension to the Åbo Akademi University Library. The exterior architecture is notable for the grains of the timber formwork being visible in the prefabricated concrete facades. The interior is particularly notable for the large hyperbolic paraboloid-shaped concrete shell structure, said to have been influenced by the then contemporaneous architecture of the Mexican architect Félix Candela. In the centre of the building is a hidden courtyard which originally had a garden (since demolished) designed by noted Finnish garden designer Maj-Lis Rosenbröijer.

In later life, he served as Resident Ambassador of the English Crown in the Holy Roman Empire, and was head magistrate for two districts of the Electoral Palatinate.

In Germany, Curtius was known as Wilhelm von Curti, where from 1654 he lived in Castle Curti in Umstadt, Hesse.

The di Curti family were Italian lower nobility from the Lombardian region around Gravedona. Branches of the family moved along Lake Geneva and the river Rhine (ex allobrogius) to the German area of the Electoral Palatinate. Sir William's father settled at the city of Bensheim, where Curtius was born in 1599.S.

His studies at the University of Heidelberg were disrupted by the initial events of the Thirty Years War. Curtius moved to the Calvinist Herborn Academy in 1621, where he studied with Alstedius, \\"the Encyclopediast\\". After two years of study at Herborn, Curtius enrolled at the Academy of Geneva, the spiritual stronghold of the Reformed Church. In 1627, he enrolled at the Sorbonne; he concluded his studies at the University of Siena.  English diplomat  thumbleftSir William Curtius, 1st Bt by Robert Cooper, after Unknown artist. Stipple engraving, early 19th century. NPG D30756 Early in the Thirty Year's War Curtius' homeland, the Palatinate, was occupied by Habsburg and Catholic League forces, after the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II decisively defeated the Elector Palatine Frederick V at the 1820 Battle of White Mountain and replaced him as King of Bohemia. The exiled Frederick and his wife Elizabeth Stuart received military and diplomatic support from the Protestant kingdoms of England and Scotland, which were ruled by Elizabeth's brother King Charles I. The successful 1830 invasion of the Holy Roman Empire by the Swedish King, Gustavus Adolfus, gave them new hope of reclaiming their Palatinate lands and their titles as King and Queen of Bohemia. Curtius was employed as a secretary to Frederick from 1629, possibly on the recommendation of his friend Joachim, son of the Palatinate administrator Ludwig Camerarius. In 1632, King Charles sent his senior courtier Henry Vane to the Swedish King to seek stronger support for the Palatine cause. Vane employed William Curtius as his secretary for the mission. As secretary, Curtius carried letters and messages between the key players. He returned from his first visit to England with letters recalling Vane but entrusting him to continue Vane's work. In return for a salary of 1,000 pounds per month, he was appointed as resident of the English Crown to the King of Sweden. It was in this English role that he was one of the last people to meet with the Elector Palatine in November 1632, when Frederick was already displaying early symptoms of the plague that killed him only days later. Curtius remained in Germany as an Agent of Charles I of England until November 1633.  In the Palatine service  Curtius visited London several times during the 1630s. In 1633, the Administrator of the Palatinate sent Curtius back to London to seek King Charles' financial support to raise garrisons for the Palatinate fortresses liberated by the Swedish. Curtius was based in London into 1634, hoping to be further employed by Charles I. Elizabeth Stuart wrote to diplomat Sir William Boswell in his support, I pray remember what I saide to you about Curtius that if the king my deare Brother will not keep him in his service, he may be dismissed with his favour, and the sooner the better for the poore man is there [in London] on his own purse and cannot be paid what is owing of him. He attended a joint assembly of Protestant princes in Frankfurt in April. Late in the year, he returned to Elizabeth's exiled court at The Hague, having failed to secure material English support for the Palatinate cause. Curtius was back in London in 1636 as chaperone for Elizabeth's teenage sons Charles Louis and Prince Rupert. He reported back to Elizabeth in great detail on various discussions and negotiations that Charles Louis had had with King Charles and others, seeking funds and other support.  English Resident in Germany  Curtis again took up an official English role when Charles I appointed him as representative of England at the Imperial Diet of Nürnberg in 1639 and 1649, and at Frankfurt in 1642. He also supported Sir Thomas Roe in Vienna in 1641–42. At the same time, Curtius represented Kurprinz Charles Louis as a member of the Palatine Council working to have the Elector Palatine's lands returned to him. Curtius was appointed by Charles I as official resident of the English Crown in the Holy Roman Empire in 1645. In 1652, when he was appointed to the Baronetcy by the then-exiled Charles II, Curtius was \\"resident for his majesty, with Gustavus, King of Sweden, and the princes of Germany\\". Charles II described him as \\"borne in these partes, and long imployed there by our father of blessed memory\\" On 5 August 1664, four years after Charles II's Restoration, Sir William was appointed Resident Ambassador at Frankfurt am Main, and remained so until recredentialled in September 1677.

At that time, half the city was owned by the Palatinate as a condominium with the changing successors of the Landgraviate of Hesse: the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt, Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel and Hesse- Rheinfels. During this time, he was appointed to the Imperial Nobility, the \\"Reichsadel\\". He also returned to England in 1661, to attend his Queen Elizabeth at the end of her life, and was at the top of her official list of mourners.  Fellow of the Royal Society  Sir William was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society on 3 October 1667. He corresponded with both Henry Oldenburg, the Secretary of the Society, and Gottfried Leibniz, bringing the latter a copy of Wilkin's Encyclopaedic Essay. \\"Mr Oldenburg read a Latin letter to himself from Sir William Curtius dated at Umbstad December 2 1668 containing assurances of his willingnese to send what philosophical communications he could out of Germany and particularly from the Elector of Mentz and from the physician of the Landgrave of Hesse Darmstadt. This letter was ordered to be entered in the Letter Book.\\"  Family and legacy  Curtius may have lost a family during the thirty year's war. On his return to the Palatinate, he married Catharina Fabricius gennant von Gressinich; her father Peter Fabricius was a Palatinate judge, her mother Anna Hoeufft was the sister of Jan Hoeufft, Dutch treasurer to Louis XIV of France. After Catharina's death in 1652, Curtius married the widow of the mayor of Frankfurt, Anna Sibylla von Stalburg, who was born to a Viennese banking family. His son, Sir Johann William, succeeded as the second Baronet Curtius and as Oberamtmann in Umstadt from 1681 to 1691.

The theme was to demonstrate the ability of new technology to bridge Australia’s great distances; powerful six wheeled trucks to traverse the road- less outback, wireless radio for transmitting progress reports, cinema projectors to screen footage of their journey in the towns visited along the route and a de Havilland aircraft to maintain contact with the ground party.

Arndt Bause produced more than 1350 dance music melodies, many of which became \\"hits\\", which meant that he had a decisive influence on the music scene in East Germany for this genre. Many of his compositions have acquired \\"Evergreen\\" status.  Life  Arndt Bause was born in Leipzig, the fourth of the recorded children of Werner Bause, an accountant, and his wife Emma. For several years, starting in 1948, Arndt Bause was made to learn the piano: by 1955 he had been captivated by music in general and Boogie-woogie in particular. He made progress as a self taught musician and started to appear in several bands, both as a pianist and as an accordionist. Between 1960 and 1963 he was also taking trombone lessons. Meanwhile, out of deference to his father's wishes, he had embarked on an apprenticeship in the relatively secure trade of glass blowing, which in 1954 he completed. By the time he completed his glass blowing apprenticeship his performing career had progressed to a point where he felt able to leave glass blowing on one side and focus on the music. He was a member of various groups which were soon getting contracts for concert and theatre work. On 6 October 1959 he married Angret Hinsch, the daughter of a plumber from Schwerin. Their three daughters were born in 1962, 1965 and 1968. With a growing family to support, Bause's income from music proved insufficient, and he returned to his trade of glass blowing. He never abandoned the music, but there was no longer time to follow an extensive performance schedule, and he turned increasingly to composing. In 1962 an orchestral composition was accepted for transmission on the radio. Soon afterwards, teaming up with the lyricist Dieter Schneider, he began to produce a series of hit songs. The collaboration with Schnieder brought Bause into the East German world of Schlager music. In 1964 the two of them came up with \\"He, Joe\\" which in 1964, sung by Gypsy, reached top place in the \\"Tip Parade\\", a hit parade-style ranking at this time organised by the national television service. Further successes followed, with songs written not just for Gypsy, but also for , Frank Schöbel and Andreas Holm. In addition to Schneider, he was also working with lyricists such as and Kurt Demmler. By 1968 his compositions were bringing in enough money to enable him to abandon glass blowing again, this time for good. He was able to use some of the time saved to undertake an external course in composition and tonal structure (\\"Tonsatz\\") at the \\"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy\\" Music Academy in Leipzig between 1969 and 1974. In 1975 Bause relocated with his family from Leipzig to Berlin. In April 1976 they acquired a plot of land in Berlin-Biesdorf, which is where Arndt would live for the rest of his life. The later 1970s were a period of intense collaboration with the singer Jürgen Walter. Between 1976 and 1982 they produced three LPs, incorporating demanding lyricss by Gisela Steineckert. In 1979 he wrote the melody for Jürgen Hart's Sing mei Sachse sing, which became his top selling title and featured on an LP entitled \\"Hart auf Hart\\" with which the two of them followed up the success of the single. In the 1980s Helga Hahnemann became the leading performer of Bause's songs, using lyrics by Angela Gentzmer. It was later reported that the professional collaboration with Hahnemann began after she accused him, \\"I never get any hits from you\\" (in their shared Leipzig variant of German: \\"Ick krieg wohl keenen Hit von Ihnen?\\"). By the time of her death in November 1991 their professional partnership was complemented by a close family friendship. Bause also wrote film music. His output included the music for two television films based on \\"talking head\\"-style monologues from Maxie Wander's book, \\"Guten Morgen, Du Schone\\" (\\"Good Morning My Lovely\\") and 24 \\"trick films\\" (animations) from the national film studio of which \\"The Flying windmills\\" (\\"Die fliegende Windmühle\\") became probably the best known. Working with librettiste Gerda Malig he also wrote, the musical \\"Gesang der Grille\\", which had its premier in 1987 at the Popular Theatre (\\"Volkstheater\\") in Halberstadt, followed by a successful tour of the country that included Berlin's Metropol Theatre (as it was then known). After the changes that led to reunification in 1990 there was less demand for his music as audiences in East Germany, for the first time, had unfettered exposure to the more diverse palette of West German Schlager music. The death of Helga Hahnemann in 1991 also removed from stage and screen someone who had, by that time, become the leading performer of his music. Arndt Bause died in Berlin suddenly, but surrounded by his family, following a major pulmonary embolism.  Family  The eldest daughter of Arndt and Angret Bause, Katrin Gawenda, became the first \\"Miss DDR\\" (\\"Miss East Germany\\") when, in 1986, the régime cautiously, and under conditions of bizarre secrecy, arranged a national beauty pageant inside a large temporarily reassigned fire station in Berlin-Marzahn. Her participation in the contest, which initially came as a surprise, resulted from a prank by her then husband, Christian Gawenda. Although her beauty was never in doubt, interviewed many years later she implied that her win might also have owed something to her aptitude as an interviewee. Asked by the moderator to name her favourite hobby, she replied, uncontroversially, that it was fishing. As a follow-up question she was asked about the biggest fish she had ever caught. \\"6ft2, 75 kilos, my husband Christian\\" (\\"1,86 Meter groß, 75 Kilo schwer. Mein Mann Christian.\\") The reply captured the spirit of the times and of the event: the audience applauded, shortly after which she received the crown. Their youngest daughter, Inka Bause, embarked on her own career as a singer in 1985, at this point performing her father's songs. More recently she has also appeared as a television presenter of popular entertainment shows.

The Buccaneers compete in the Men's State Basketball League (SBL) and play their home games at Activewest Stadium. The team is affiliated with Geraldton Amateur Basketball Association (GABA), the major administrative basketball organisation in the region. Team history =Establishment= In the 1980s, the highest level of basketball in the state of Western Australia was played in the Perth-based District Competition. In an effort to expand the league, the Western Australian Basketball Federation began approaching various business people in the country areas to gauge their interest in a statewide basketball competition. Among those approached were Brian Middleton and Graham Greenaway, residents of Geraldton. Middleton and Greenaway convinced Kevin Jones, the Administrator of the Geraldton Amateur Basketball Association (GABA), to join them in establishing a basketball team in Geraldton. With Jones leading the project, Middleton and Greenaway provided funding for the licence and became the team's private owners. They served as the licencees until the GABA eventually bought the rights to the team. Geraldton was joined by Albany and Bunbury, and then Kalgoorlie and Mandurah. =Early success= 1989 saw the formation of the State Basketball League (SBL). Initially known as the Batavia Buccaneers, the team's inaugural coaching staff included Head Coach Tom McClain, a former player for the Perth Wildcats, and his two assistants, Kevin Jones and Jim O'Dea. Americans Dan Hunt and Brian Funingsland were the team's first two import players, while Perth native Ray Chamberlain joined the squad. All three players were members of the East Perth Eagles' 1988 premiership team. The Buccaneers finished their inaugural season as minor premiers, earning first place on the standings with a 19–3 record. They defeated the Willetton Tigers 106–93 in the semi-finals before losing 114–89 to the Perth Redbacks in the SBL Grand Final. In 1993, the Buccaneers won their second minor premiership after finishing the regular season in first place with a 19–5 record. In 1996, they made their first grand final appearance since 1989, where they lost 103–86 to the Bunbury City Slammers. In 1997, they returned to the SBL Grand Final, where they lost 94–92 to the Perth Redbacks. In 2000, the Buccaneers finished on top of the West Conference table with a league-best 17–2 record. They made it through to their fourth SBL Grand Final, where behind a 30-point effort from Greg Brown, they defeated the Lakeside Lightning 96–76 to win their maiden championship. Alongside Brown, Canadian forward Jeff Bevington had 25 points and 15 rebounds while Daniel McGlynn had 18 points. The following season, the Buccs made their fifth grand final appearance in 13 years, but despite a 30-point effort from Bevington, they were defeated 101–83 by the Perry Lakes Hawks. =Sixth grand final appearance= The Buccaneers played in the finals every year throughout the 2000s. In 2011, they missed the finals for the first time since 1998. They again missed the finals in 2012 before returning to form in 2013 with a playoff appearance. Following their revival in 2013, the Buccaneers headed into the 2014 season not settling for anything less than a championship. Behind imports Carter Cook and Jerrah Young, as well as former Melbourne Tigers player Bennie Lewis and veterans Aaron Ralph, Mat Wundenberg and Luke Wrensted, the Buccaneers claimed their first minor premiership since 2000 with a 19–7 record. They went on to beat the South West Slammers and Lakeside Lightning in four straight playoff matches to reach their first SBL Grand Final since 2001. However, they came up short in the championship decider as they were defeated 99–83 by the East Perth Eagles. The Buccaneers had now won just the one championship from six grand final appearances. =Early finals exits= In 2015, the Buccaneers remained in the mix for top championship contenders as they finished the regular season in second place with a 20–6 record. Despite their impressive season and boasting a roster that included Carter Cook, Bennie Lewis, Aaron Ralph, Daniel Thomas and Cory Cooperwood, the Buccaneers were outclassed by the seventh-seeded Goldfields Giants in the quarter-finals, losing the series 2–0. Despite losing Bennie Lewis for the 2016 season, the Buccaneers were able to cover his loss by acquiring Matthew Adekponya and Jackson Hussey, while also signing Maurice Barrow to complement four-year import Carter Cook. They went on to lead the Buccs to a fourth-place finish with an 18–8 record, before advancing to the semi-finals where they were swept by the eventual champion Cockburn Cougars. The 2017 season started off well for the Buccaneers, as they went 6–1 over the first seven games. The Buccs' early-season form demonstrated their ability to cover all areas, with imports Maurice Barrow and Dwayne Benjamin tremendously versatile, Mat Wundenberg and James Paringatai experienced bigs, Jackson Hussey and Matt Hancock a strong back court, and Aaron Ralph a sharpshooter off the bench. They went on to finish the regular season in third place with a 19–7 record before reaching the semi-finals, where they were defeated 2–1 by the Joondalup Wolves despite taking the first game. There was a mass turnover in the playing stocks for the Buccaneers leading into 2018, with Benjamin and Hancock moving on, while Hussey and Barrow also departed to join the defending champion Perth Redbacks. As a result, they picked up imports Gokul Natesan and Colter Lasher, to go with Marcus Alipate of Tonga and Earnest Ross of Guam. With a 23–3 record in 2018, the Buccaneers won their first minor premiership since 2014. It also marked the Buccs' best regular-season record since 2001, when they finished second at 24–2. They went on to lose to the eighth-seeded Rockingham Flames in straight sets in the quarter-finals. =Second championship= The Buccaneers retained the services of import Colter Lasher for the 2019 season, while losing Natesan and Ross. Initial import Willie Conner was replaced mid-season by DeAngelo Isby, who himself was later released during the quarter-finals. The Buccaneers finished the regular season in third place with a 19–7 record, and after two three-game playoff series, they reached the SBL Grand Final. In what was their seventh championship decider, the Buccaneers defeated the Joondalup Wolves 92–80 to win their second championship.

Primary and secondary school education he finished in Kotor, Cetinje and Belgrade. From January 1944 he joined to Tito's partisans. He finished undergraduate studies at Belgrade University: at the Faculty of Law in 1950 and at the Faculty of Philosophy in 1956. From 1958 he dedicated himself to historiography and started his academic career as a researcher at the History Department of the Institute of Social Sciences (May 1958-August 1963). He earned his PhD degree at the Belgrade University Faculty of Law in 1962. As a researcher he worked at the Department for the History of the Yugoslav Workers' Movement of the Workers' Movement Research Institute (September 1963-January 1969) and the Institute of Contemporary History (January–November 1969). From 1969, he was an associate professor and from 1975 a full professor at the Belgrade University Faculty of Philosophy, Department of History. Petranović was also a member of editorial and advisory boards of numerous historical journals and anthologies (Istorija XX veka, Istorijski glasnik, Vojnoistorijski glasnik, Jugoslovenski istorijski časopis, etc.). During his academic career he advised 28 MSc and 19 PhD students.Stanković, Đ., Dimić,L., Mira Radojević, M.: Istorija, a ne politika , Politika, April 21, 2008 Petranović never retired. He died on 17 June 1994 and was buried in Belgrade. Historiography Petranović published 32 books in 38 volumes, 314 scientific papers in conferences proceedings and scientific journals and 259 surveys in scientific journals. He authored two TV documentaries dedicated to the history of Yugoslavia. He was a 20th-century historian who Yugoslav and foreign academics dedicated 296 articles to. His academic archives, found after his death, were source for additional six books (out of which one was published in the United States) and ten new scientific papers. He contributed to the transformation of the Yugoslav Communist Party institutions from party services into serious research institutes. As a historian he fought against fanaticism, fatalism, and taboo creation in historiography i.e. fought against historian being a privileged liar of the rulers.The \\"privileged liar\\" phrase was borrowed from the H. de Balsac's Catherine de Medici: There is a general cry of paradox when scholars, struck by some historical error, attempt to correct it; but, for whoever studies modern history to its depths, it is plain that historians are privileged liars, who lend their pen to popular beliefs precisely as the newspapers of the day, or most of them, express the opinions of their readers. Most his academic research and career was dedicated to the 20th century epoch and to Yugoslavia. Historian Ljubodrag Dimić, in his Foreword to Branko Petranović: The Yugoslav Experience of Serbian National Integration, stressed that the twentieth century epoch in Yugoslavia was not inclined to the historian, especially not to the one who was trying to gain rational knowledge about the history of the Yugoslav state and society. In the first years following the Second World War, ideological and political conditions were not favorable for the study of history. The knowledge of history was considered to be unnecessary and, quite often, undesirable. The interests of the revolution, the people, the state and the working class were colliding with the postulates of the profession. These, for a historian, unfavorable social conditions were something he faced and understood as a dictature. Even when his works were influenced by the ruling communist ideology and its phraseology, the same works provided numerous insights into main problems of the historic development of Yugoslav state. As a historian, he was led by his principle stating that a historian cannot dedicate himself to the history of his times without confronting his own work and results to other historians research.Perišić, Miroslav: Branko Petranović (In memoriam) in Jugoslovenski istorijski časopis, Issues 1-2, Savez društava istoričara Jugoslavije, Belgrade, 1999., page 297-301 He thought that disintegration of second Yugoslavia was a tragic event and, as a historian, he tried to thoroughly examine the multiple causes hidden behind the politics which lead to the disintegration of both Yugoslavias. He stated that Yugoslavia was the only state keeping all Serbs inside the same state and that both Yugoslavias disintegrated due to the fact that they were dictatures with no democratic alternative. He stated that the dictatures were not able to counter taboos, religious intolerance and divisions, uneven economic development of Yugoslav regions, and influence and interest of great powers. His overall research can be summarized by the twentieth century themesDimić, Ljubodrag; Lončar, Dragomir: Branko Petranović, Bibliography and Biobibliography, Faculty of Philosophy, Belgrade University 1996 *Kingdom of Yugoslavia *History of Serbia in WWII *Communist Yugoslavia *WWII resistance movement in Europe *role of a historian in contemporary epoch Petranović influenced a group of his students who became later historians at Belgrade University: Ljubodrag Dimić, Desanka Pešić, Latinka Perović, for example. He advised his graduate students not to be historians of a single subject, rather historians of a century. He taught his students to think about a single event as an event in the context of the world history process within local environment.Ljubodrag Dimić: Eksplozija istorije (in Serbian) Selected works        References External links *Petranovic about destruction of two Yugoslavias (in Serbian) *T.

It was brought by the food writer and activist Jack Monroe against the columnist Katie Hopkins after Hopkins falsely alleged that Monroe had vandalised a war memorial. Hopkins was ordered to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in damage and legal fees.  Background  Monument to the Women of World War II During an anti-austerity protest in 2015, protesters spraypainted \\"fuck Tory scum\\" on the Monument to the Women of World War II in Whitehall, London. On the social media site Twitter, the political writer Laurie Penny said she had no problem with the vandalism. Katie Hopkins, a rightwing columnist, reacted negatively, suggesting that Penny be sent to join the Islamic State. Both writers' comments received national media coverage.Judgment: Monroe -v- Hopkins, HM Courts and Tribunal Service 2017. On 18 May, a few days later, Hopkins tweeted to the food writer Jack Monroe: \\"Scrawled on any war memorials recently?\\" Monroe responded that she had never vandalised a war memorial and had family members in the armed forces. Hopkins responded in a tweet asking someone to explain the difference between Penny (an \\"irritant\\") and Monroe (\\"social anthrax\\"). Monroe asked for a retraction via Twitter and was blocked by Hopkins. Monroe asked Hopkins to make a public apology and give £5,000 to \\"migrant rescue\\" as a settlement to prevent the matter going to court. Hopkins did neither, and the matter proceeded to court.  Decision  On 10 March 2017, Mr Justice Warby judged that the two tweets sent by Hopkins were defamatory to Monroe (according to the Defamation Act 2013) and were the source of \\"serious harm\\", a prerequisite for demonstrating libel. The court assessed the damage to Monroe at £24,000—£16,000 for the first tweet, and £8,000 for the second. Hopkins was also ordered to pay costs, estimated at over £300,000. Warby's judgment discussed the difficulty of applying English libel law to new media platforms like Twitter, and contains an extended discussion on how Twitter functions.  Aftermath  Some days after the decision, Hopkins, who did not appear in court, stated that she was \\"very likely\\" to appeal against the ruling, on the grounds that no evidence of harm had been produced in the court. About two and a half weeks after the judgment Hopkins was told she could not appeal; Warby said Hopkins' appeal would not have \\"a real prospect of success\\" in his view. A week after the verdict, Monroe said she bore \\"no ill will\\" towards Hopkins: \\"Although what she said about me was wrong and the last two years have been a grim process, I would happily sit down and talk as adults. I just think the world is a bit better when you are willing to give people chances.\\" Monroe said she hoped the case will set a precedent and improve Twitter. Hopkins sold her Exeter home in March 2018 to pay the debts arising from the case, and applied for an individual voluntary arrangement in May. Monroe said of the news: \\"My offer of a cup of tea still stands if she wants to talk about it ... Lots of people are celebrating but I’m not. It's a sad, lonely sort of anticlimax. It’s really crap and I feel really bad it’s all ended up like this.

All four crew members on board, Captain Dara Fitzpatrick, Chief Pilot Mark Duffy, winch operator Paul Ormsby, and winch man Ciáran Smith were killed. In a preliminary report published in April 2017, the Air Accident Investigation Unit found that the helicopter had clipped the small island of Blackrock at an altitude of around while on approach to Blacksod Lighthouse for a refuelling stop, and subsequently crashed out of control into the sea. Events On 14 March 2017, Rescue 118 had completed the medical evacuation of an injured fisherman west of Blacksod, for which Rescue 116 had provided support, and was returning. Shannon ATC last had communication from Rescue 116 at shortly before the crash announcing 'making our way to Blacksod for refuel'. Refuelling is a common practice in a long- range and lengthy SAR mission. The helicopter itself did not make any mayday call, but disappeared from air traffic control radar around 12:45am and failed to arrive at Blacksod, prompting the issuing of a declaration of emergency by the Marine Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) in Dublin. Rescue 118 was advised of the situation and routed to Blacksod to begin a search for the missing helicopter. Rescue 115, the Shannon Airport-based Coast Guard helicopter, was immediately dispatched to the area to aid in the search, along with a CASA CN-235 maritime patrol aircraft from the Irish Air Corps. The Irish Naval Service offshore patrol vessel LÉ Róisín arrived in the search zone at 9:00 am on 14 March. Divers from the Naval Service Diving Section and Garda Water Unit and RNLI vessels were also sent to the scene. Investigators from the Air Accident Investigation Unit attended the scene on the same day. The Naval Service flagship LÉ Eithne joined the search effort that afternoon, and both Naval Service vessels continued the search throughout the night and into the next day. Eithne was made on-scene coordinator of the recovery mission. The Marine Institute's RV Celtic Voyager was dispatched on the night of 14 March to search using multibeam echosounders to help locate the wreckage. The Commissioners of Irish Lights also sent the ILV Granuaile, an advanced multifunctional vessel, to the scene. The Marine Institute's work class ROV Holland one was mobilised onto the Granuaile in Galway harbour . The vessel is equipped with a dynamic positioning system which allows it to operate in difficult sea conditions, cranes capable of hoisting recovered wreckage and a helicopter platform. The Geological Survey of Ireland surveyed the underwater region and carried out detailed mapping where the search was focused on to aid diving teams in the recovery of the wreckage. The Navy's LÉ Samuel Beckett later joined the recovery efforts and assumed command as the on-scene coordinator. On the afternoon of 15 March, a signal transmitting from the helicopter's flight recorder had been received by a team from the Irish Marine Institute using USBL equipment from a local fishing vessel. The signal emanated at around southwest of Blackrock Island, west of the coast at Blacksod Bay. On 16 March, AAIU investigators were airlifted onto the helipad at Blackrock lighthouse, where a significant section of wreckage from Rescue 116 was found on the high rocky island. From the examination of this tail section AAIU investigators believe that the tail of the helicopter made contact with the western slopes of Blackrock. The preliminary report by AAIU investigators found that the helicopter had hit the island, which was registered in the craft's GPS mapping system but not on EGPWS. (EGPWS) is a legacy capable Class A terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) designed for digitally equipped aircraft. Intense SAR operations continued on Saint Patrick's Day on 17 March. Captain Dara Fitzpatrick's funeral took place on 18 March in Glencullen, Dublin. Poor weather conditions continued to impede the search. Air Corps resources issues In the aftermath of the incident, the Defence Forces said in a statement that the Air Corps had originally been contacted at 10:06 pm on 13 March by the Coast Guard, with a request to provide top cover to Rescue 118 which was tasked with evacuating a fisherman to hospital from a vessel west of the Mayo. In the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the Department of Defence and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the \\"provision and tasking of Air Corps assets [is] on an 'as available' basis\\". The Air Corps denied the request because of a staff shortage in experienced and trained personnel, which made it unable to operate an \\"out-of-hours\\" roster. This meant Rescue 116 was deployed instead to provide top cover. Following the Blacksod incident, an Irish Times report highlighted how resourcing issues delayed the Air Corps involvement in the rescue, and highlighted that Air Corps' CASA maritime patrol fixed-wing aircraft have advantages over CHC operated helicopters in top-cover situations, in that they can arrive \\"twice as fast\\" and \\"remain circling in its higher vantage point for up to nine hours\\". At 1:45 am, an hour after last contact from Rescue 116, the Coast Guard made an emergency request for assistance to the Air Corps to help search for the missing SAR helicopter. The Air Corps activated its recall plan and 3 hours and 45 minutes after the Coast Guard's initial request for top cover, a CASA CN-235 maritime patrol aircraft was airborne. The Defence Forces said that in 2017 three requests for top cover had to be refused due to reduced availability. Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny, who was also Minister for Defence, said that it was \\"well known\\" that the Air Corps had lost a number of personnel such as pilots and air traffic controllers in recent years. Minister with responsibility for Defence Paul Kehoe said that reduction in the capacity of the Air Corps was notified in summer 2016 to agencies and that the Department of Defence had made other arrangements in that regard. Since the crash took place, there have remained safety concerns for search and rescue helicopter services in Ireland, with problems including cartographic errors and omissions, problems with the navigational software, inadequate life jackets and a lack of oversight of the Search and Rescue service. Wreckage recovery and search for the missing On 22 March, the wreckage from R116 was found by the Marine Institute Holland 1 ROV after signals from the flight data recorder pinger were received as well as some items of wreckage on Blackrock. There were hopes that the bodies of the missing crew members could be found in the wreckage. On 24 March, Naval Service divers recovered the flight recorder from the wreckage on the sea bed on the eastern side of Blackrock, at a depth of 40 metres. Air Accident Investigation Unit chief inspector Jurgen Whyte confirmed that the black box was \\"visually in good condition\\" and would be flown under escort to the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch for the data to be downloaded. Later on the same day Naval divers discovered the body of one of the three missing crew members in the cockpit section of the wreckage. On 26 March the body of the crew member was retrieved from the wreckage by NSDS divers and identified as that of co-pilot Captain Mark Duffy. On 30 March, the funeral took place of Captain Duffy in County Louth. Throughout the recovery attempts weather and sea conditions have forced diving to be suspended for long periods for safety reasons. The large sea surface and underwater swells and currents around Blackrock Island have been making it dangerous for divers to operate and decompress safely from the 40m depths at which the wreckage lies. In tandem with wreckage salvage there were extensive aerial, sea and coastline searches. On 1 April, The AAIU announced no mechanical anomalies were identified from initial data from the recorders and therefore no additional safety actions would be required on similar helicopter types. The AAIU also stated they intended to make a preliminary report in the near future. A superintendent from Belmullet Gardaí said that the wreckage recovery of a section of the wreckage should take a matter of hours once suitable conditions arose to enable a safe lift. On the evening of 2 April, the main bulk of the helicopter was raised from the sea and placed aboard the Irish Lights vessel Granuaile. After the lifting of the wreckage, it was confirmed that there was still no sighting of either winch operator Paul Ormsby or winch man Ciáran Smith. The search for the missing crew members continues. On 3 April, the Irish Coastguard indicated to the families of the missing crewmen not to give up hope as they would continue searching for the missing crewmen. At the suggestion of local fisherman the families of the missing crewman also appealed for fishermen and seafarers in Donegal and elsewhere where wreckage debris had been found or was likely to join in the search as their local knowledge would be invaluable. On the weekend of 8 April 2017 over 110 fishing vessels joined RNLI lifeboats, Irish Coast Guard and others in a co-ordinated sweep of over 8,500 square kilometres from Blacksod to Donegal in one of the largest sea searches in Irish maritime history. As the missing were not located the next phase would be targeted searches and vigilance of special areas of interest.  Tributes  The Rescue 116 helicopter with the same four crew members involved in the crash was present in Series 3 Episode 1 of the Irish TV show Paramedics, after being called in to assist in the extraction of a teenage boy with a dislocated patella within a remote field, three weeks before the fatal Rescue 116 crash. Rescue 116 was unable to land in the field due to electrical cables and livestock which would have made it unsafe to land, and so, Rescue 116 was forced to return to its base. A tribute was made by the paramedics involved in the rescue of the teenage boy within the episode. Final report The Air Accident Investigation Unit circulated a 333 draft version of the final report into the crash in November 2019. The report was delayed, prompting a review - the first in the 25 year history of the AAIU.

Background During late November 1967, U.S. intelligence detected that the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 22nd Regiment of the 3rd Division was about to commence operations in the Bồng Sơn area. Between 1 and 4 December the PAVN made probing attacks against Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) positions along Highway 1, however U.S. and ARVN forces were unable to locate the PAVN. Battle Battle of Tam Quan 6-11 December 1967 On the afternoon of 6 December, the 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division received intelligence on the location of the headquarters of the PAVN 22nd Regiment near the village of Dai Dong and aero-scout helicopters from A Troop, 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry Regiment (1/9th) were sent to investigate. The helicopters saw a radio antenna and were fired on and at 16:30 aero-rifle troops were landed nearby, but were quickly pinned down by enemy fire. At 16:55 D Troop was landed to support A Troop, but they were also pinned down. At 17:25 the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment (1/8th) was ordered to engage and by 18:00 had landed nearby and joined up with an ACAV platoon from the 1st Battalion, 50th Infantry Regiment (1/50th) that had moved forward from Landing Zone English. By 21:00 this combined force had managed to extract the 1/9th troops. The force then set up a night perimeter. From 07:25 on the morning of 7 December the site of the previous day's engagement was hit with aerial rocket and artillery fire and by 09:15 Company A 1/8th and Companies B and C 2/8th had been landed by helicopter and together with the ARVN 40th Regiment formed a perimeter around the area. The 1/8th then began moving east towards the blocking forces, but met strong resistance from the entrenched PAVN and pulled back to allow tactical air strikes and artillery to soften up the positions. At 14:06 Companies A and B 1/8th, supported by flamethrower APCs, resumed the advance and broke through the PAVN positions while the 2/8th attacked westward. The operation resumed at 07:45 on 8 December with Company C 1/8th relieving Company B 1/8th. At 08:15 CS gas was fired into the PAVN positions, forcing some soldiers to flee, who were then hit by artillery fire. Aero-scout helicopters identified 23 PAVN soldiers killed. At 08:50 1/50th and Companies A and C 1/8th began sweeping the area, destroying the remaining PAVN positions. By 15:30 the sweeps were completed and forces began withdrawing to LZ English. At 05:00 on 10 December the 3rd and 4th Battalions of the ARVN 40th Regiment were attacked by the PAVN 8th Battalion, 22nd Regiment; the attack was repulsed with support by gunships and artillery. From dawn the ARVN carried out a series of attacks on the PAVN positions and at 15:45 were joined by Company D 1/50th for a final attack. On the morning of 10 December the ARVN received reports that the villagers of Truong Lam (2) () were fleeing the area, Companies B and D 1st Battalion, 12th Cavalry Regiment (1/12th) joined Company B 1/50th to search Truong Lam.

During the day the ARVN 40th Regiment was replaced by the South Vietnamese 3rd and 4th Marine Battalions. At 22:15 Company D 2/8th Cavalry ambushed several PAVN units as they attempted to escape the area to the South. On 12 December the combined force of the Vietnamese Marines, 1/12th Cavalry and Company D 1/50th began a sweep of the area. They engaged a PAVN force at 10:55 and overran the position. Search and destroy operations continued on 13 and 14 December with little contact. On the morning of 15 December 1/12th Cavalry located the PAVN 22nd Regiment and was later joined by Company A 1/50th. Despite intensive air and artillery preparation the attack was repulsed and the force withdrew to allow for further supporting fire to soften up the PAVN positions. During the day the 40th ARVN Regiment, Company B 1/8th Cavalry and Companies A and D 2/8th Cavalry established blocking positions around the PAVN. On 16 December Companies A and C 1/50th supported by Company C 1/12th attacked north through the village of Truong Lam (1), meeting light resistance until midday. Companies A and D 2/8th Cavalry and Company C 1/50th pursued retreating PAVN. Search and destroy operations continued on 17 and 18 December with little contact. On 19 December intelligence was received on the location of the PAVN 22nd Regiment near the village of An Nghiep. Aerial reconnaissance by A Troop, 1/9th Cavalry located a radio antenna and a large bunker complex. At 14:08 Company D 2/8th Cavalry was landed by helicopter and immediately engaged by a PAVN force. Company D broke contact to allow for air and artillery fire and three more Companies were landed by helicopter to the south and west to establish blocking positions.

It was released in 1997 on American breakbeat label Moonshine Music and is the first series in Frolic's Happy 2b Hardcore series of DJ mix albums, documenting the emergence of happy hardcore music in the United Kingdom and Europe. The series itself is a spin-off of Moonshine's Speed Limit 140 BPM+ series of fast-tempo dance music compilations. The album was conceived to introduce American audiences to happy hardcore, and contains sixteen of the genre's anthems which carry many of happy hardcore's defining characteristics, such as fast tempo, frantic breakbeats, major key tonality, off-kilter, quirky keyboard effects and \\"semi-melodies.\\" Moonshine had modest anticipations for the album and their numerous promotional campaigns involved arranging for Frolic to promote the album on radio, a \\"whirlwind\\" of attention which took Frolic by surprise. The album was a surprise success, selling over 100,000 copies, a remarkable amount for a compilation of underground music. It is credited with helping increase the genre's spread in the United States and for inspiring Frolic's Hullabaloo happy hardcore rave in 1997, the first of its kind in the United States. Critics welcomed the album as a great introduction to happy hardcore, and Ned Raggett later named it the 102nd best album of the 1990s. Background Happy hardcore emerged largely in the United Kingdom in the mid-1990s, characterised by a very fast tempo (usually around 160–180 BPM), often matched with solo vocals and sentimental lyrics, and also by a generally major key tone, 4/4 beat \\"happy\\" sound distinguishes it from most other forms of hardcore, which tend to be \\"darker\\".\\"Business as usual for critic-proof Boys Pop Reviews ; Deck goes here\\" – Toronto Star Initially, the genre was often additionally characterized by piano riffs, spacey sounds and synthetic stabs. In the UK, the long-running Bonkers series of happy hardcore DJ mix albums was the most popular happy hardcore compilation series, beginning in 1996 with an inaugural edition mixed by Hixxy and DJ Sharkey. American dance label Moonshine Music, known for importing electronic music from the UK and releasing it in the United States for the first time, conceived Happy 2b Hardcore in 1996 as a means to introduce American audiences to the genre. The label's repertoire at that point consisted of rave music and UK hardcore genres, including jungle music, drum and bass and breakbeat techno; however, they had not released any happy hardcore music. They contacted Canadian happy hardcore enthusiast and disc jockey Anabolic Frolic, who had sent them an unsolicited demo, to compile and mix the album. Due to the music's fast tempo, Happy 2b Hardcore was released as a spin-off to the label's long-running breakbeat hardcore series of compilations, Speed Limit 140 BPM+. Music Happy 2b Hardcore's liner notes describe the album as containing sixteen \\"happy hardcore hardcore techno anthems\\" mixed together by Frolic, the songs themselves recorded by \\"a bunch of UK and maybe European acts.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20000307005644/http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~tewing/ned/n102.html Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic described the music as containing \\"ultra-fast bpms, accompanied by more than enough synth melodies to hum along to -- or blow your rave whistle to,\\" while music critic Ned Raggett described the music on the album as being \\"as fast as gabber without being at all macho; the jungle breaks are ripping along, but even more hyperspeed hollow, with the songs carried as much by the bizarro keyboard squelches and quick bursts of semi-melody before everything suddenly speeds up all over again, and again and yet again. And then stops and starts and continues as it should and could and must always, while shreds of lyrics pop in and out and around and back again, as purely resistant of the dire lit crit model of music writing as any straight instrumental.\\" John Bush of AllMusic, acknowledging the album's usage of \\"anthems,\\" noted the album's inclusion of \\"classics\\" such as Eruption's \\"Let the Music\\", DJ Codeine & Unknown's \\"Feel the Power\\" and DNA's \\"Go Insane.\\" Specific points in the album noted by journalists include the introductory melody line from \\"Take On Me\\" by a-ha making a sudden appearance in the introduction of \\"I Believe\\" by DJ Stompy, the unnamed singer on \\"Here I Am\\" by DJ Ham, DJ Demo and Justin Time \\"suddenly [taking] off with the title line and the immediacy of the sheer moment of it all just brings it all home -- while Chuck D yelping \\"Ah yeah, now that's progress\\" is reduced to a mere sped-up blip stuck in at the weirdest points, the tyranny of lyrical meaning implicitly quashed in the rush.\\" Release and promotion The yellow smiley is a symbol of rave music in the United Kingdom. Frolic described Moonshine Music's hopes for Happy 2B Hardcore as \\"modest,\\" seeing as the album was planned to be a standalone release. Moonshine promoted the album with posters and magazine advertisements and arranged for Frolic to appear on numerous radio stations, be interviewed by the media, and photographed by a publicist. \\"I was now plugged into their promotional machine,\\" he recalled. \\"My friend George turned to me and said 'I'll always remember you, Chris'.\\" The work he was asked to take to promote the album took Frolic by surprise: \\"Up until this point I was just a small DJ, playing small local raves, but certainly not on the level of doing international appearances and promotion. So it definitely felt like a whirlwind ride.\\" An official launch party for the album was held in Los Angeles, where Frolic played a rave he had promoted beforehand on the city's popular dance station Groove Radio. During his appearance on Groove Radio, he also played a live DJ mix in the studio. Moonshine Music released Happy 2b Hardcore on 21 January 1997 in the United States. The usage of yellow smileys on the record's album cover, described by Raggett as \\"nice big smiley faces […] floating above a bunch of speaker cones,\\" highlight the rave aspect to the music, as the yellow smiley symbol had been used in the United Kingdom since the acid house era to represent rave music.The Independent, March 3, 1990: “Acid House, whose emblem is a vapid, anonymous smile, is the simplest and gentlest of the Eighties’ youth manifestations ... non-aggressive (except in terms of decibels).” Anabolic Frolic recalled the album's striking album cover made it stand out in the \\"electronica\\" section of American record stores: \\"It’s no surprise it was an immediate hit.\\" Many customers purchased the album on a whim, and wrote to Frolic afterwards; in 2017, Frolic rhapsodised that it's \\"hard to think back to those days before MP3s and internet streaming, that often you just bought CDs in the store trying your luck and hoping you liked it.\\" Reception and legacy Upon its release, Happy 2b Hardcore was a surprise success, selling over 100,000 copies, which Frolic noted \\"which was an incredible number for obscure music.\\" He later said the album's success \\"emboldened\\" him: \\"I knew the audience was out there, but rave promoters at the time didn’t know how to book it inside their events.\\" As such, it inspired him to birth the successful Hullabaloo raves in June 1997 in order to cater for happy hardcore's American audience. Also as a result of the album's success, Moonshine and Frolic later released multiple sequels to the album, turning it into the first of a series; the first sequel, the similarly acclaimed Happy 2b Hardcore: Chapter Two, was released 9 September 1997. The series became a best-selling series. Happy 2b Hardcore was also released to critical acclaim. John Bush of AllMusic rated the album four and a half stars out of five and said it is \\"the best place for happy hardcore novices to begin as well as a great mix (by Slipmatt) for fans who already have most of the material.\\" He concluded that, \\"along with several volumes in the Now We're Totally Bonkers series, the collection is one of the best documents in happy hardcore's immense catalog.\\" In 2002, Billboard noted the album's release was a significant moment in the history of Moonshine, \\"documenting the underground sound of happy hardcore.\\" The album, along with other instalments in the series, later influenced happy hardcore producer one nut Chaos D. In 1999, Ned Raggett of Freaky Trigger ranked the album at number 102 in his list of \\"The Top 136 or So Albums of the 90s\\". He described it as a \\"perfectly sequenced and mixed compilation\\" and Frolic as \\"[blending] everything together just right\\": \\"it's not merely a great mix disc, it's just so goddamn fun and nuts that I can't understand why anyone would actually hate it, while realizing at the same why loads of people couldn't stand it.\\" He described the music as sounding \\"like it's mutating and growing and changing as you listen to it, and is so wonderful for it.\\" Track listing # Eruption – \\"Reach Out\\" – 2:27 # JDS – \\"Higher Love\\" (Slipmatt Remix) – 5:50 # DJ DNA – \\"Go Insane (Future Primitive Remix)\\" – 4:20 # DJ Codeine & Unknown – \\"Feel the Power\\" – 4:24 # Seduction & Dougal – \\"It's Not Over (Remix)\\" – 3:44 # DJ Hixxy & Bananaman – \\"Forever\\" – 4:10 # DJ Ham, DJ Demo & Justin Time – \\"Here I Am\\" – 4:08 # Eruption – \\"Surrender\\" (Force & Styles Remix) – 5:04 # DJ Ham – \\"Here We Go Again\\" – 3:46 # DJ Stompy – \\"I Believe\\" – 3:09 # Force & Styles – \\"Heart of Gold\\" – 4:12 # DJ Demo – \\"Muzik\\" – 4:01 # DJ Stompy – \\"Dawn of a New Era\\" – 4:34 # Eruption – \\"Let the Music\\" (Brisk Remix) – 4:44 # Scott Brown vs. DJ Rab-S – \\"Now is the Time\\" (Hixxy & Trixxy Remix) – 3:08 # Hixxy – \\"Wanting to Get High\\" (Smoogies Awake) – 4:24 See also *Happy hardcore References 1997 compilation albums DJ mix albums Happy hardcore music Breakbeat hardcore albums Dance music compilation albums ","title":"Happy 2b Hardcore"},{"id":"53480442","text":"Detective Barbie is a series of three mystery themed point and click adventure games starring the character Barbie.

It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. The building now houses the Little Traverse Historical Museum. History The Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad began service to Petoskey in 1874, and was the only railroad in the area. In 1891, a second railroad, the Chicago and West Michigan Railway, began constructing a line with attendant buildings, between Elk Rapids and Petoskey. The railway purchased this land on the shore of Little Traverse Bay to place their Petoskey Depot. The company hired the Cadillac firm of Mosser and Wilson to construct the depot, and both the rail line and depot were completed in 1892. The town of Petoskey then created a park (now Pioneer Park) surrounding the depot. In 1899, the Chicago and West Michigan Railway and this station was absorbed into the Pere Marquette Railway. The Pere Marquette, in turn, was merged into the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in 1947. The Petoskey station continued to serve passengers until the 1950s, when it was abandoned. IN 1970, the Little Traverse Regional Historical Society obtained a lease on the depot and some of the surrounding land. The building was converted into a museum in 1971, and as of 2017 is used as the Little Traverse Historical Museum Description The Chesapeake and Ohio Depot is located just on the edge of Little Traverse Bay. It is a distinctly Victorian Shingle style building with a distinct Victorian cast. The long building originally had open platforms at each end, but these were filled in during subsequent renovations. A porte cochere extends in the front of the building, and perching atop the building is a squat conical roof. Next to the conical section is a tall narrow chimney.

History  = Early history = From European settlement through the late 1800s, the Concourse area occupied wooded lands and rocky formations within and on the periphery of the estate of the prominent Morris family who farmed in what is now Southwest Bronx. Until 1845, the area was part of the Town of Westchester within Westchester County. After the subdivision of the Town of Westchester in 1845, the Concourse area became part of the Town of West Farms. In 1855, West Farms was further subdivided and the Town of Morrisania was created. With the promise of city services, the Morrisania along with the Towns of West Farms and Kingsbridge seceded from Westchester County to join Manhattan as part of New York County. The three towns were referred to as the \\"Annexed District\\". In 1896, the vast majority of what is now the Bronx joined New York County. In 1898 the City of Greater New York and Borough of the Bronx were formed, and all former Westchester County annexations within New York County were reconstituted into the independent County of the Bronx in 1914. = 20th century = 161st Street in 1900 Expansion of the subway system enabled rapid development of the Concourse. The first subway crossed under 149th Street into the area in 1906 and is now the IRT White Plains Road Line (). The IRT Jerome Avenue Line opened a decade later in 1917 and spurred enormous development in the area. Concurrent with subway development and inspired by the City Beautiful movement, the New York City built the Grand Boulevard and Concourse (shortened to the Grand Concourse). Modeled after Paris’ Champs-Élysées, the original boulevard stretched from the Bronx Courthouse to near Van Cortlandt Park, but was later extended south to 138th Street by supplanting the existing Mott Avenue. The Grand Concourse was further improved by the extension of the IND Concourse Line () under most of its length in 1933. Yankee Stadium was built 1923 when Jacob Ruppert moved the team from the Polo Grounds in Manhattan, where the Yankees shared space with the New York Giants, to the Bronx. With the exception of a brief period in the 1970s, the Yankees have been in Concourse for almost 100 years. Infrastructure and services brought residents. Some of the 500,000 people who moved to the borough in the 1920s lived in the Concourse. The new construction to accommodate those residents was inspired by the City Beautiful movement and the 1901 Tenement House Act, which mandated light, air, and fire protection. This yielded 5- and 6- story multifamily residential buildings throughout the neighborhood built in a variety of styles from Tudor, Renaissance, and Colonial Revival to Art Deco and Art Moderne. In the late 1930s the Works Progress Administration dubbed the area “the Park Avenue for the Middle Class”, and the area maintained that reputation through the 1950s. The Concourse inspired visits by presidential candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, and John F. Kennedy. However, after 1960, the area began to decline quickly due to white flight, incentives to move to the suburbs, redlining, the development of Co-Op City, disinvestment by New York City, and arson. While no buildings burned down in the Concourse during the period, the population of the area declined until the 1990s when the population started to rebound. = 21st century = View of both old and new Yankee Stadium Recent developments in the Concourse include construction and neighborhood improvements, and the neighborhood is gentrifying . The Yankees built a new stadium in 2009. The former stadium was demolished; a large public park—Heritage Field—was established in its place. The Bronx Museum of the Arts undertook a major expansion in 2006, and is currently exploring another addition. The Bronx Hall of Justice opened in 2007. The Bronx Terminal Market opened in 2009 as did the adjacent Mill Pond Park, which includes a Stadium Tennis Center. In the 2000s, the New York City Department of Transportation started making capital, aesthetic, and safety improvements to the Grand Concourse with much of the work completed within the Concourse neighborhood. A redesign of 161st Street during the 2000 reconstruction of the Grand Concourse brought additional pedestrian space to the neighborhood. In 2011, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated a large portion of the neighborhood as the Grand Concourse Historic District. In 2016, the New York City Economic Development Corporation issued requests for proposals for a new redevelopment project in the Concourse, along the Harlem River shore. A $300 million proposal, announced in September 2017, includes 1,045 affordable housing units as well as a new Universal Hip Hop Museum that is to open in 2020. The first of two phases will have 600 affordable unites, a waterfront promenade, a public plaza, a performance space, a movie theater, and the hip hop museum. Demographics 1100 Grand Concourse Concourse is divided into two neighborhood tabulation areas, East Concourse/Concourse Village and West Concourse, which collectively comprise the population of Concourse.New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012.

The paper has a fortnightly circulation of around 1,000 available to students and staff at the university during term-time, covering news and sport on campus, as well as comment pieces, features, lifestyle and arts coverage. It also publishes content online. In 2020-21 the appointed editors are Joshua Talbot (Editor-in-Chief), Georgia-may Keetch (Online Production Editor), and Ellie Doughty (Print Production Editor). The paper used to run as a weekly publication from its inception until 2017 and is the only print and online newspaper that serves the University of Sussex. It is one of five student media outlets at the University, alongside the student TV station - UniTV, URF - the student radio station, The Channel - the student arts magazine, Fabrik - the student fashion magazine. History The Badger began in October 1995, having formerly been known as Unionews since the 1970s. The paper has since covered a variety of stories, including several on-campus occupations and the expulsion of five Sussex students for involvement in protests. The Newspaper was embroiled in a scandal in 2015 when its own students' union seized copies of the newspaper and prevented them from being distributed, which also forced the then editor to resign. The University of Sussex Students' Union claimed the papers were seized due to the potential for legal action against them. This stemmed from an article written about legal action taken by a student against the University. In 2017, journalists from the newspaper were accused of 'fake news' and Sun level journalism by a senior member of staff, Professor Laurence Pearl, then head of the Life Sciences Department, after the paper ran a story on problems within the school. Professor Pearl stood down from his position towards the end of the year of publication. Awards The Badger has previously been nominated for and won awards from the Student Publication Association, a body for student newspapers in the United Kingdom and Ireland. This includes winning an award for Best Sports Coverage in 2014, and former Editor, Daniel Green, being highly commended for their Outstanding Achievement award in 2016. In 2016 The Badger was nominated for Best Sports Coverage and for Best Comment/Opinion Piece.

PRAC (Probabilistic Action Cores) is an interpreter for natural- language instructions for robotic applications developed at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bremen, Germany, and is supported in parts by the European Commission and the German Research Foundation (DFG).  Goals  The ultimate goal of the PRAC system is to make knowledge about everyday activities from websites like wikiHow available for service robots, such that they can autonomously acquire new high-level skills by browsing the Web. PRAC addresses the problem that natural language is inherently vague and unspecific. To this end, PRAC maintains probabilistic first-order knowledge bases over semantic networks represented in Markov logic networks. As opposed to other semantic learning initiatives like NELL or IBM's Watson, PRAC does not aim at answering questions in natural language, but to disambiguate and infer information pieces that are missing in natural-language instructions, such that they can be executed by a robot. \\"This problem formulation is substantially different to the problem of text understanding for question answering or machine translation. In those reasoning tasks, the vagueness and ambiguity of natural-language expressions can often be kept and translated into other languages. In contrast, robotic agents have to infer missing information pieces and disambiguate the meaning of the instruction in order to perform the instruction successfully.\\" In addition to probabilistic relational models, PRAC uses the principles of analogical reasoning and instance-based learning to infer completions of roles in semantic networks. PRAC has been successfully applied to teach robots to conduct chemical experiments and to make pancakes and pizza from wikiHow articles.

Life He was the son of Abraham Titley of Hopton, Staffordshire. He was admitted a king's scholar at Westminster School in 1714, and was three years later elected to Cambridge. While at Westminster he acted as \\"help\\" to Osborn Atterbury, son of Francis Atterbury, and later was his tutor. At Trinity College, Cambridge, he matriculated in 1720, and graduated B.A. in 1723, M.A. in 1726. Titley laid down a plan for life, and approximately carried it out: first 30 years of study, then 30 years give to public business, and after the age of 60, back to study. Having entered the diplomatic service, he became secretary of the British embassy at Turin. On 3 January 1729 he was selected to act as chargé d'affaires at Copenhagen, in the absence of Lord Glenorchy; and on 3 November 1730 was named envoy-extraordinary. The strategic aim of Great Britain was to avoid Denmark allying itself with France. In 1733 Richard Bentley, Master of Trinity College, appointed him to the college's physic fellowship; Titley resigned his diplomatic position to accept it, but did in the end did not move from Copenhagen. He resumed his post, and held it for the remainder of his life. During his time there, two Hanoverian princesses married into the Danish royal family. On Titley's application to Frederick V of Denmark in 1761, the king agreed to order the seizure and extradition of British deserters from the British army and navy, on condition of a similar service being performed for him in England. Two years later, in 1763, Titley was, on the ground of age and infirmity, granted an assistant. Titley died at Copenhagen in February 1768. He left £1,000 each to Westminster School and Trinity College, and £500 to the University of Cambridge. Part of the last bequest was to be devoted to buildings. Works Titley wrote an Imitation in English of an ode of Horace (second ode of the third book of Horace), admired by Bentley who parodied it. Both poems and in James Henry Monk's Life of Bentley. Some of his Latin verses are contained in Reliquiæ Galeanæ. The poem Laterna Megalographica, included in Vincent Bourne's Works (1772), is also attributed to Titley.

Several watercourses run through the property, including Coongan River, Emu, Sandy, and Badgeyong Creeks, which also contain several permanent pools of water. The landscape is mostly flat spinifex country. The lease was first taken up by John Withnell and William McLean in July 1886. The Mackay brothers, along with Donald and Roderick Louden, took up a holding in 1887. The Mackays' lease consisted of three parcels of each. In 1890, George Dudley and Alfred Howden Drake-Brockman took up land on what is now Mount Edgar Station. Howden selected the Corunna Downs land and named it after the Battle of Corunna. The leases of the Withnells and Mackays were registered to Dalgety & Company and worked by the Brockman brothers. In 1916 the property produced over 147 bales of wool, and 105 were produced in 1920. The property was made up of 13 separate leases that were combined into a single lease in 1924 when it was acquired by Ernest Samuel Foulkes-Taylor. Taylor had previously held Glenorn Station, near Malcolm, with his younger brother Charlie. In 1924 Corunna Downs was still a fully operational sheep station carrying 20,000 head of sheep, 350 cattle, 125 horses, 175 donkeys and 8 camels.

Career Ljungdahl was born on 7 August 1897 in Lund, Sweden, the son of merchant August Ljungdahl and his wife Clara (née Lundberg) and brother of Karl-Gustaf Ljungdahl, the CEO of ÅF. He became an officer at the South Scania Infantry Regiment (I 25) in 1918 and was trained as a pilot at Malmslätt from 1921 to 1923. Ljungdahl also attended the Royal Central Gymnastics Institute from 1922 to 1924, the Royal Swedish Army Staff College from 1924 to 1926 and the Royal Swedish Naval Staff College from 1926 to 1927. He served as captain of the General Staff in 1930 and as teacher at the Royal Swedish Army Staff College from 1930 to 1937. Ljungdahl was military attaché and air attaché in London from 1935 to 1936 and was promoted to major in the Swedish Air Force the same year. He was head of the Education Department of the Air Staff from 1936 to 1939 when he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. Ljungdahl was wing commander of the Västmanland Air Force Wing from 1939 to 1942 and was promoted to colonel in 1940.

Ljungdahl was commanding officer of the Third Air Group (Tredje flygeskadern, E 3) from 1947 to 1954 when he was promoted to lieutenant general. In 1954 he was appointed Chief of the Air Force. During Ljungdahl's time as Chief of the Air Force began the necessary modernization and expansion of including base and combat management systems. The Air Force began to bring balance and thus became a more homogenous and enduring force. He retired in 1960 and was then promoted to full general. Ljungdahl conducted his farewell flight as Chief of the Air Force in a J 28 Vampire. During his career, Ljungdahl was also an expert in the 1930 Defense Commission and a member of the 1931 and the 1933 Air Commission as well as the Civil Aviation Board (Luftfartsstyrelsen) in 1945.

The official investigation concluded that the aircraft was improperly loaded. Accident At 18:00 local time the Tu-104 lined up on runway 21 and commenced its take-off run during snowing weather conditions. After rotation the aircraft pitched up beyond normal take off attitude and eight seconds after lift off, at an altitude above ground level (AGL) of 50 meters the Tupolev stalled and entered a right bank. The aircraft continued to roll right until it struck the ground 20 meters from the departure end of the runway, crashing nearly inverted and bursting into flames, killing 49 of the 50 people on board. One person who was in the cockpit was ejected from the nose of the aircraft and was found alive in the snow not far from the crash site but died on the way to a hospital. Aircraft The Tupolev Tu-104A involved was serial number 76600402 and registered as CCCP-42332 to the Soviet Navy. The construction of the airliner was completed on 26 November 1957. Investigation The investigation of the accident revealed that the crew allowed the aircraft to be improperly loaded. Evidence was uncovered that led investigators to believe that some military officers did not comply with seating assignments given by the crew and that these officers pressured the crew to make the flight in an unsafely loaded aircraft. Another factor reported by witnesses was that large rolls of paper were loaded on board and it is believed that these rolled rearward during acceleration on take off, causing the center of gravity (CG) to shift aft of acceptable limits thereby reducing the stability of the aircraft in pitch, making it impossible for the crew to lower the nose. Casualties Memorial in the Serafimovskoe Cemetery, St Petersburg to those who died in the 1981 crash The Tupolev Tu-10A was carrying many of the Pacific Fleet's senior officers from Leningrad, where they had been attending meetings with the naval command, to Vladivostok, via Khabarovsk. Among the dead were 16 admirals and generals, including the commander of the Pacific Fleet, Admiral Emil Spiridonov and his wife. They were both interred with most of the other victims of the crash in the Serafimovskoe Cemetery in Leningrad, where a memorial to the dead was erected on the orders of the Navy's Commander-in- Chief, Sergey Gorshkov.

It is listed Grade I for its architectural, historical and topographical value. It originally served the village of Wenden Magna (Great Wenden), which was merged with Wenden Parva (Little Wenden) to form Wendens Ambo in 1662. Architecture The building consists of a chancel with organ chamber, an aisled nave, a south porch and a tower surmounted by a Hertfordshire spike. The vestry in the western end of the south aisle, is unusually positioned. =Tower= The oldest part of the structure is the 11th century tower. It is usually described as Norman. However, it could be pre- Conquest on the basis of a series of round window openings, like portholes: these small openings are found in Anglo-Saxon architecture and are sometimes called 'sound holes' although there actual function is unclear. The ones at Wendens Ambo are similar to late Saxon windows in St Bene't's church in Cambridge. History The first church on the site was probably constructed of wood, perhaps as early as the eighth century, but no trace of it remains. It seems to have been rebuilt in stone about the time Domesday Book was written (1086 A.D.) with later additions in the 13th, 14th, 15th and 19th centuries. The church register of Great Wenden commenced in 1540. After Volume II, which was the register of Little Wenden until 1662, the two parishes were united as Wendens Ambo. =Churchyard and hall= In the 19th century Lord Braybrooke gifted land and a hall neighbouring the church to enable an extension to the ancient churchyard. The hall was extensively modernised in 2007 and under lease to the Village Hall, is managed for use by a variety of active village interest groups and activities.

Sailing handicap standards exist internationally, nationally, and within individual sailing clubs. Typically sailing vessel classes are defined by measurement rules, which categorise vessels accordingly into classes of vessels, and vessels compete within their class. Handicapping allows vessels to compete across classes, and also allows vessels and crews to compete based on performance and equipment on an equal basis, by adjusting the race outcome data, to declare a handicap (adjusted) winner as distinct from a line honours (first over the finish line) winner. For some national, international, and other yacht racing events, rules such as those of the International Racing Certificate known as the International Measurement System (IMS) or the Sportsboat rule (SBR) may be specified. Others exist in different countries. Other handicap systems of a simplified measurement type are designed to allow very different yachts of diverse designs to compete on an equal basis. This is particularly so for trailer sailers that may race in trailer sailer fleets or in mixed fleets. For example, Performance Handicap Racing Fleet (PHRF), Class Based Handicap (CBH), and Yardstick which is based more on previous individual performances rather than vessel design characteristics. Forms of sailing handicapping =Class Based Handicap= Class Based Handicap (CBH) measurement system is used, for example, for trailer sailers, such as in Australia and also in New Zealand. In Australia, the CBH system is a nationally governed handicap designed to assess the potential speed of the boat. It does not take into account the experience of the crew. Vessels are given a rating number based on a set of measurements. It represents a very well sailed boat kept in top racing condition, that is the boat at minimum weight, good sails, fair hull. =Yardstick= Rather than a vessel measurement rule, Yardstick as in Portsmouth Yardstick is used in the UK is a way of rating different classes of trailer yachts relative to each other. These are adjusted annually at a state or regional level. At a club level, starting from a CBH or Yardstick rating a Performance Based Handicap or PBH may be used, such as PBH. This attempts to measure the relative performance of a particular yacht and crew against other yachts and crews either of the same type of other type. Clubs will often run an event or season championship based only upon a CBH rating together with a handicap winner based upon a regularly adjusted PBH figure for each yacht and crew. In theory the PBH which is adjusted after each race gives each boat an equal chance of winning each race. =Performance Handicap Racing Fleet= Performance Handicap Racing Fleet (PHRF) is a handicapping system used for yacht racing in North America. It allows dissimilar classes of sailboats to be raced against each other. The aim is to cancel out the inherent advantages and disadvantages of each class of boats, so that results reflect crew skill rather than equipment superiority. PHRF is used mainly for larger sailboats (i.e., 7 meters and above). For dinghy racing, the Portsmouth yardstick handicapping system is more likely to be used. The handicap number assigned to a class of yachts is based on the yacht's speed relative to a theoretical yacht with a rating of 0. A yacht's handicap, or rating, is the number of seconds per mile traveled that the yacht in question should be behind the theoretical yacht. Most boats have a positive PHRF rating, but some very fast boats have a negative PHRF rating. If Boat A has a PHRF rating of 15 and Boat B has a rating of 30 and they compete on a 1-mile course, Boat A should finish approximately 15 seconds in front of Boat B. Results are adjusted for handicap by the race committee after all competitors have finished. Each region has its own variation on PHRF rules and ratings, based on local conditions. In some countries a Performance Handicap Racing Fleet (PHRF) may be used to rate trailer sailers, such as in NZ and in the USA and Canada. International rule The International rule, also known as the Metre rule, was created for the measuring and rating of yachts to allow different designs of yacht to race together under a handicap system. Prior to the ratification of the International rule in 1907, countries raced yachts under their own national rules and international competition was always subject to various forms of subjective handicapping. History During the early part of the 19th century interest in yacht racing had achieved sufficient momentum to need an agreed handicapping system to allow different types of yacht to race on an equitable basis. The method of measuring merchant sailing ships carried over into the world of yacht racing so that a yacht also now had a measured tonnage which allowed size comparisons and hence performance comparisons to be made between yachts on the basis that a properly designed big yacht will sail faster than a properly designed small yacht. Each yacht fell within a Class based upon its measured tonnage. In the early 19th century four ranges of tonnage and hence four Classes were defined. Based on experience gained from the results of numerous races each Class was allocated a distance allowance that the Class had to give away to the next lower Class. This was equivalent to a Class 1 having to sail more distance than a Class 4 yacht during a race. In 1834 handicapping by distance was changed to handicapping by time. As yacht racing in particular became more and more popular designers started to look for and found loopholes in the measurement rules to enable a design to get a better rating. Whilst this encouraged designers it discouraged owners from participating in handicap racing because designs were being outdated almost before the yacht was launched. In order to restore the equilibrium, work began on new formulas, which resulted, in the Thames Measurement which was the first formula defined for yachts. The adoption of the British Thames Measurement by the Yacht Club of France in 1870 may mark the beginning of international rating rules. In 1893, the Germano- Scandinavian Union was formed and it developed its \\"Union Rule\\". Starting in 1902, under the leadership of the New York Yacht Club, U.S. yacht clubs agreed to a Universal Rule in 1905 which was based on a formula developed by Nathanael Herreshoff. The Universal Rule determined a yacht's eligibility to race in the America's Cup from 1914 to 1937 and for this the J-class was chosen. Boats built according to the rule reached their peak in the large J-class yachts. This Rating Rule is intended to calculate a rating for yachts, which can then be used to calculate its Time Correction Factor (T.C.F.) in order to have disparate yachts racing against each other. The International Offshore Rule (IOR) was a measurement rule for racing sailboats. The IOR evolved from the Cruising Club of America (CCA) rule for racer/cruisers and the Royal Ocean Racing Club (RORC) rule. The IOR concentrated on hull shape with length, beam, freeboard and girth measurements, foretriangle, mast and boom measurements, and stability with an inclination test. Additionally, the IOR identified features which were dangerous, or it couldn't fairly rate, and penalized or prohibited them. The measurements and penalties were used to compute the handicap number, called an IOR rating, in feet. The higher the rating, the faster the boat was deemed to be able to sail. The IOR was superseded (in the early 1990s) by the International Measurement System (IMS) and CHS (since renamed IRC). While some IOR yachts race at club level under IRC in more or less their original form, others had major surgery to make them competitive within the new rules.Seashore Magazine February 98 In the United States, the most common handicapping rule is the PHRF rule, developed and promoted by the United States Sailing Association. While most other rules do not take past performance into account, PHRF differentiates itself by allowing skippers to request handicap reductions after a series of poor racing results. In Europe, the most common handicapping system used today is the IRC rule. Velocity prediction program Velocity prediction program (VPP)s are used by a variety of sailing organizations to assess theoretical boat performance and then assign \\"handicaps\\" to allow boats of different styles and sizes to race against one another.

The skill in betting on a handicap race lies in predicting which horse can overcome its handicap. British Horseracing Authority. Accessed February 5, 2011. Although most handicap races are run for older, less valuable horses, this is not true in all cases; some great races are handicaps, such as the Grand National steeplechase in England and the Melbourne Cup in Australia. In the United States over 30 handicap races are classified as Grade I, the top level of the North American grading system. Handicapping in action In a horse handicap race (sometimes called just \\"handicap\\"), each horse must carry a specified weight called the impost, assigned by the racing secretary or steward based on factors such as past performances, so as to equalize the chances of the competitors. To supplement the combined weight of jockey and saddle, up to the assigned impost, lead weights are carried in saddle pads with pockets, called lead pads. The weight-for-age scale was introduced by Admiral Rous, a steward of the Jockey Club. In 1855 he was appointed public handicapper. In Britain the horses are assigned weights according to a centralised rating system maintained by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA). Weights may be increased if a horse wins a race between the publication of the weights and the running of the contest. =Predicting the outcome of races= Thoroughbred handicapping (in the USA) is the art of predicting horses who have the greatest chance of winning a race, and profiting from these predictions at the horse races. The Daily Racing Form (DRF), a newspaper-style publication, is an important tool of the handicapper or horseplayer. The DRF details statistical information about each horse entered in a race, including detailed past performance results, lifetime records, amount of money earned, odds for the particular horse in each past race, and myriad other information available for casual or serious study. The handicapping process can be simple or complex but usually includes the following elements prior to the race: *Study of the Daily Racing Form. *Observing the horses’ body language and behaviour in the paddock and/or post parade. *Watching the tote board for the changing odds of each horse and thus for clues about how the betting public views a horse's chances of winning the upcoming race “Trip handicapping” takes place during the race and involves watching the horses (usually with binoculars) and noting relevant information about how a horse runs during that race. Handicapping theory is possibly one of the most enigmatic theories in all of sports. Horseplayers consider the following elements when handicapping a horse race: ;Speed: The DRF lists times at certain call points of each race, and the lengths back from the lead at each call point. Speed handicappers compare race times to help ascertain which horses will most likely win the race. The DRF contains a numerical summation of the speed that each horse ran in every race, called a Beyer speed figure. This number is generated through a method developed by Andrew Beyer, and described in his 1975 book Picking Winners. The Beyer speed figures takes into account the individual class of a race as well as how the racetrack was playing on a particular day to create an aggregate number for each horse. ;Pace: Pace handicappers classify each horse's running style (i.e. front runner, stalker, presser, closer) and then find contenders based on the predicted pace of today's race. The difficulty is that the jockey has control over where a horse is placed in a race and how fast that race goes in the early stages. This takes the prediction of pace for a given race out of the realm of mathematics and into the realm of mere speculation. Until the 1970s, for pace handicapping purposes, the time generally allotted by pace handicappers for a horse to run a length (approximately 11 feet) during the course of a race was long thought to be a fifth of a second. Andrew Beyer was the first to contest this in his 1975 book Picking Winners, stating that the time span of a beaten length (at the end of the race) varied by race distance, as horses would be traveling faster at the end of shorter distanced races than they would at longer ones. Others, particularly devotees of the Sartain Methodology in the 1980s, furthered this principle to include fractional (internal race) times. Today, the value of a beaten length is generally accepted to be closer to 0.16 seconds than to 0.20. The standard of one-fifth of a second is somewhat valid in Standardbred (harness) racing. ;Form: A \\"sharp\\" horse could have finished strongly, stayed among the leaders, finished “in the money” (1st, 2nd or 3rd) or recovered from a bad racing trip. Conversely, a horse showed dull form if it gave up, looked sluggish or chased the pack. Horses with sharp form have the lowest odds and hence return the least money per bet. Also, often horses will race off a \\"layoff.\\" A layoff is a rest varying in length from usually two months to a year or more. In this case, workouts, horse appearance, and trainer patterns are the best guides to whether the horse is ready to run after a rest. ;Class: Horse races occur at different levels of competition. Generally, high caliber horses are entered in races with other high caliber horses and slower horses are entered in races with other slower horses. But a horse can move up or down in class, depending on where the trainer decided to enter the horse based on the results of its last race. Note that the strength of the same class of race, such as a Maiden Special Weight race, will vary greatly from track to track, as well as from race to race at the same track, making this too an inexact determinant of class. ;Post-position or draw: The horse nearer the inside of a race track will have a shorter distance to run than a horse on the outside track, although it is also more vulnerable to being cut off by horses that start off faster and head to the inside rail. ;Jockey: A better jockey can make a difference between a winning horse and one that loses. ;Other factors: Other factors affecting the outcome of a race are track condition, weather, weight that the horses have to carry, daily bias of the racing surface, and many more factors that the handicapper cannot know. The track condition is closely linked to the weather as rain/snow and the amount of sun affect the firmness of the turf or the condition of the dirt. A wet track is usually denoted as \\"sloppy\\". There are cases however when a roller is run over a wet track (if the rain has stopped) and such a track is denoted \\"sealed\\". It is difficult to measure some factors with data.

Since 1552, he served as tutor to the then heir apparent, later the Longqing Emperor for nine years, which made the emperor trust him fully. He served successively as Vice Minister of Rites, Vice Minister of Personnel, and Minister of Rites. In 1566, he was promoted to the Grand Secretariat of Wenyuan Chamber with recommendation from Xu Jie. After the enthronement of the Longqing Emperor, Gao's higher status catalyzed a sudden escalation of antagonism between Gao and Xu. Impeached by several censors, he was forced to retire in 1567. Zhang Juzheng did his utmost to persuade the emperor to recall Gao for political reasons. Thus, Gao returned to Beijing in 1569. He replaced Li Chunfang, the former Senior Grand Secretary, who was defeated in the political struggle by the death of the emperor. Zhang was hostile to him afterwards. The eunuchs in the Directorate of Ceremonial headed by Feng Bao brooked no weakening of their power by Gao. Hence, an alignment grew up between Zhang and Feng aimed at marginalizing Gao. They criticized Gao before Empress Dowager Xiaoding. Gao had to retire and return home once again. He finished the memoir Bingta yiyan () [The last words left on my sickbed] in his later years. In 1578, Gao died at home. Although Gao's term was quite brief, he made great efforts with Zhang to subsume Altan Khan's Tumed into the tributary system.

From 1859, she was commissioned for numerous royal portraits by Queen Victoria.  Biography  Dixon was the eldest daughter of seven children (two sons, five daughters) born to a corn chandler in Horncastle, Lincolnshire. She began working with water-colour by the mid-19th century, and completed portraits in Horncastle. She was instructed by Magdalene Dalton (née Ross), sister of portrait painter William Charles Ross. Despite this instruction, Dixon did not spend much time studying art, copying pictures, or pursuing further education. Princess Beatrice Dixon worked in Hull, on the Isle of Wight, and in London until the end of the 19th century. From 1844 to 1893, Dixon displayed 222 portraits at the Royal Academy. In 1859, Dixon received her first Royal commission from Queen Victoria, to paint a miniature of Princess Blanche d'Orléans (1857-1932) at Claremont. A number of her portraits remain in the Royal Collection. The royal favour she received from Queen Victoria allowed Dixon to earn further commissions from nobility. Her works are noted for having characteristics of using warm flesh tones (especially in the forehead) and yellow in the sky. Dixon occasionally used gilded backgrounds in her work. Her skill at capturing likenesses meant that she had a successful career during a time when many portraitists were facing competition from the advent of photography. Dixon died on 15 February 1901 at the age of 83 and was buried in Horncastle cemetery.

It follows the valleys of Zwickauer Mulde and Mulde from Glauchau via Rochlitz and Grimma to Wurzen and is hence also known as Muldentalbahn (Mulde valley railway). Regular traffic on the line ended in the early 2000s. The section between Glauchau and Großbothen has been leased by Deutsche Regionaleisenbahn since 2005 and has been protected as a cultural monument since 2016, the remainder has been decommissioned.  History  Already in 1860, a committee formed in Penig with the aim of constructing a railway from Glauchau to Wurzen. In 1864 the Saxon parliament permitted the construction of a railway from Leipzig along the Mulde valley to Chemnitz. Since no private entrepreneur could be found for this project, permission was granted instead in 1868 for a railway from Glauchau via Wurzen to the border with Prussia. The private Muldenthal- Eisenbahngesellschaft was awarded the concession for the construction and operation of a railway between Glauchau and Wurzen on 29 April 1872. No concession was granted for the line to the border, because a continuation in Prussia could not be guaranteed. While the right of way was intended for double-track operation which was taken into account in the construction of the Rochsburg tunnel and several bridges, due to the lack of a northern continuation the traffic never reached the levels that would have justified doubling of the line. Nevertheless the line was built to mainline standards. It was put into operation in several stages: * from Glauchau to Penig on 10 May 1875, * from Rochlitz to Großbothen on 9 December 1875, * from Penig to Rochlitz on 29 May 1876, and * from Großbothen to Wurzen on 30 June 1877. On 1 August 1878 the Muldenthal-Eisenbahngesellschaft was taken over by the Saxon state, the line and the rolling stock passed into the hands of the Royal Saxon State Railways. The separate station in Wurzen was closed, and the station of the Leipzig–Dresden railway became the terminus of the Muldentalbahn. The Rabenstein bridge near Grimma was strengthened in 1931 which was possible without interrupting the traffic, because the line and the bridge had been prepared for double-tracked operation. Last remaining span of the Rabenstein bridge near Grimma, repaired after World War II, but unused (1977) On 15 April 1945 the Rabenstein bridge across the Mulde river was destroyed, and the line remained interrupted between Großbothen and Grimma unterer Bahnhof. Tracks on this section were lifted for war reparations, and despite repairs to the bridge they were never relaid. Passenger traffic between Grimma unterer Bahnhof and Nerchau ceased on 28 May 1967, but was partly reopened with trains between Golzern and Wurzen on 24 September 1967, before ceasing on this section completely on 31 May 1969. The Wurzen-Golzern section remained in operation for freight traffic as an extended siding of Wurzen station, and tracks were renewed between Nerchau and Golzern in the 1970s. The right of way near Dorna-Döben station was used for a widening of the parallel road. A connecting curve between this line and the Borsdorf–Coswig railway was built south of Großbothen in the mid-1970s. It was mainly intended for strategic reasons and was only used for regular traffic for a short time in 1995 while a bridge in Großbothen was renewed. Preparations had been made for deploying a temporary bridge across the River Mulde between Neichen and Trebsen, the terminus of the line from Beucha. For this purpose, a track had been laid from Trebsen station to the left bank of the river. Freight traffic between Wurzen and Golzern ended on 2 June 1996. Only a short section between Wurzen and a silicate factory in nearby Dehnitz remains in operation, the remainder of the Wurzen–Grimma section has been transformed into a cycle trail. Faulty trackwork caused the passenger trains between Colditz and Rochlitz to be replaced by buses from 6 December 1999, and freight traffic between Großbothen and Wechselburg officially ceased on 5 December 1999. Passenger traffic between Rochlitz and Großbothen ceased on 27 May 2000, freight traffic between Glauchau and Wechselburg on 2 July 2000, and passenger traffic between Wechselburg and Rochlitz on 9 June 2001. Operations on the last section between Glauchau and Wechselburg ceased on 13 August 2002 in the course of the 2002 European floods which caused widespread damage in the area, and because of the poor state of the line and several engineering works along it. Track motor car in Amerika halt (2013) Deutsche Regionaleisenbahn (DRE) leased the Glauchau-Großbothen line and the Rochlitz–Narsdorf section of the Rochlitz–Penig railway in 2005 with the intention of preserving the infrastructure and resuming the traffic in stages. Lack of finances, damages to the embankment following the construction of a motorway, and damages to bridges due to vehicle collisions have delayed the resumption of operations, so that the first DRE train between Glauchau and Wolkenburg could only run in October 2010. After some sections of track had been cleared of vegetation, a regional support association in cooperation with a major Saxon railway club have conducted several touristic operations with a track motor car. When the grounds and the infrastructure of the line were sold by Deutsche Bahn to a private company in Chemnitz in late 2015, fears of a dismantlement of the line were countered by a successful petition for the line being granted the status of a protected monument. This was awarded in early 2016.  Description of the line  From Glauchau to Sermuth the line follows the river Zwickauer Mulde, from there to Wurzen the joint Mulde river. Motorway bridge across river, railway, and road near Penig The Glauchau–Wurzen line branches off the Dresden–Werdau railway at the eastern end of Glauchau station. Near Remse station, it runs parallel to today's Bundesstraße 175, but on the other side of the river. Between Wolkenburg and Thierbach-Zinnberg stations it changes from the right to the left bank of Zwickauer Mulde. Between Thierbach-Zinnberg and Penig it crosses over state road S57 on a bridge, just metres before the latter crosses the river on another bridge. A third bridge leads the motorway A 72, opened in 2011, across river, road, and railway. Railway bridge near Rochlitz castle In Penig station the line from Narsdorf which had been opened in 1872 joined from the north. After Rochsburg station the railway passes a tunnel and then a bridge across the river, and after Lunzenau station it passes under the Göhren Viaduct, which leads the Neukieritzsch–Chemnitz railway across the valley of Zwickauer Mulde. About 500 m on, immediately after the bridge across the Chemnitz, the Wechselburg–Küchwald railway approached from the right and ran parallel to the Mulde valley line until Wechselburg station where the two lines joined. Between Steudten halt and Rochlitz station, the line crosses to the left bank of the river on a lattice girder bridge near Rochlitz castle. Rochlitz station was the junction with the Rochlitz–Penig railway and the Waldheim–Rochlitz railway. North of Rochlitz the Mulde valley line crosses to the right bank of the river, passing Lastau station and crossing to the left bank again before reaching Colditz, running parallel to today's Bundesstraße 107. Before reaching Großbothen station, the terminus of the southern section of the line since its interruption in 1945, it crosses over the Borsdorf–Coswig railway. The tracks of the Glauchau–Wurzen railway are north of the Großbothen station building. North of Großbothen the line passed Kloster Nimbschen halt and crossed on Rabenstein bridge on the right bank of the Mulde. It followed the bends of the river, passing under motorway A 14 north of Golzern station, until Neichen which was the junction of the narrow gauge line from Mügeln. There the railway left the immediate vicinity of the river and ran in a mostly straight line until Wurzen station where it joined the Leipzig–Dresden railway from the southeast at signal box 2.

She was unbeaten in three starts as a two-year-old in 2012 including the Listed Washington Singer Stakes and the Group Two Rockfel Stakes. In the following year she finished second in the 1000 Guineas before winning the Irish 1000 Guineas and finishing third in the Coronation Stakes. As a four-year-old she produced her best form in North America where she won the E. P. Taylor Stakes as well as being placed in the Beverly D. Stakes and the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf. After being sold for a record price of 4.5 million guineas at the end of 2014 she was beaten on her only start as a five-year-old and was retired from racing to become a broodmare. Background Just The Judge is a bay or brown mare with a white star and a white sock on her left foreleg bred in Ireland by Joan Keaney Dempsey. As a yearling in September 2011 the filly was offered for sale at the Goffs Orby sale and was bought for €50,000 by the bloodstock agency BBA Ireland and the trainer Charles Hills. She entered the ownership of the Sangster family and Matthew Green and was taken into training by Hills at Lambourn in Berkshire. She is from the second crop of foals sired by Lawman who won the Prix du Jockey Club and the Prix Jean Prat in 2006. His other progeny have included Most Improved, Marcel and Harbour Law. Just The Judge's dam Faraday Light showed absolutely no racing ability, finishing tailed-off in both of her races. She was, however, a descendant of the influential Irish broodmare Mesopotamia (foaled 1961), who was the ancestor of many major winners including Halling, Mastery, Balla Cove and Cherokee Rose. Racing career =2012: two-year-old season= Just The Judge was ridden in all three of her races by her trainer's brother Michael Hills. On her racecourse debut she started the 11/4 joint-favourite for a maiden race over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 26 June. After being restrained towards the rear of the nine-runner field she began to make progress in the last quarter mile, took the lead inside the final furlong and won by three quarters of a length from Pompeia. On 18 August the filly was moved up in class and matched against male opposition for the Listed Washington Singer Stakes over the same course and distance. Starting at odds of 3/1 she was held up by Hills in the early stages she made \\"smooth headway\\" to join the leaders a furlong out and then accelerated to win by a length from the colt Excess Knowledge. After the race a half-share in the filly was bought by Sheikh Fahad Al Thani's Qatar Racing. After an eight-week break Just The Judge returned in the Group Two Rockfel Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 13 October and started at odds of 6/1 in an eleven-runner field. The Irish-trained Gift From Heaven started favourite started favourite whilst the other runners included Melody of Love (Firth of Clyde Stakes) and Scintillula (runner-up in the Moyglare Stud Stakes). After racing just behind the front-runners she accelerated into the lead approaching the final furlong and kept on well to win by one and three quarter lengths from the Luca Cumani-trained Nargys. Charles Hills commented \\"She won like a nice filly and Michael said she still had another gear. She has gone away again when she hit the rising ground. She has gone in her coat and had a bad scope following her last run and we had thought of not running today, but I am delighted we decided to give it one more go\\". =2013: three-year-old season= Jamie Spencer took over as Just The Judge's jockey in 2013 and rode her in all but one of her subsequent races. On her three-year-old debut, Just The Judge was one of fifteen fillies to contest the 200th edition of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket on 5 May. Starting the 7/1 third favourite she tracked the leaders before taking the lead inside the final furlong but was overtaken in the final strides and beaten half a length into second place by Sky Lantern. Three weeks after her run at Newmarket, the filly was sent to Ireland and started the 2/1 favourite for the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh. Her fourteen opponents included Big Break (Killavullan Stakes), Maureen (Princess Margaret Stakes, Fred Darling Stakes), Harasiya (Silver Flash Stakes), Just Pretending (Derrinstown Stud 1,000 Guineas Trial) and Rehn's Nest (Park Express Stakes). After settling behind the leaders Just The Judge began to make progress in the last quarter mile, overtook Just Pretending 150 yards from the finish and \\"stayed on well\\" to win by one and a half lengths from Rehn's Nest. After the race Hills said \\"I'm feeling relieved at the moment, but I'm sure I'll wake up in the middle of the night and think it's great. Jamie never really had to pick the stick up and he gave her a beautiful ride\\". Just The Judge faced a rematch with Sky Lantern in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot on 21 June. She took the lead approaching the final furlong but was no match for Sky Lantern who accelerated past her to win by four lengths, with Just The Judge losing second place to the French-trained Kenhope in the final strides. She was moved up in distance for the ten-furlong Nassau Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse on 3 August but made no impact and finished unplaced behind Winsili. On er final run of the year, in Sun Chariot Stakes at Newmarket on 28 September she led the field for most of the way before fading badly and finishing sixth of the seven runners. =2014: four- year-old season= On her debut as a four-year-old Just The Judge was matched against male opposition in the Earl of Sefton Stakes at Newmarket on 17 April and finished fifth behind the eight-year-old gelding Mull of Killough. She returned to female competition and started favourite for the Princess Elizabeth Stakes at Epsom in early but was beaten into third place by the six- year-old Thistle Bird and Odeliz. She faced Thistle Bird again in the Pretty Polly Stakes at the Curragh later that month but again proved no match for the older mare and finished third of the eight runners. For the remainder of the season Just The Judge was campaigned in North America. IN the Grade I Beverly D. Stakes at Arlington Park on 16 August she had some trouble obtaining a clear run before finishing strongly and taking a close third behind Euro Charline and Stephanie's Kitten. On 19 October at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto Just The Judge started 1.6/1 favourite for the E. P. Taylor Stakes over one and a quarter miles with the best-fancied of her seven opponents being Deceptive Vision (Canadian Stakes) and Odeliz. After being restrained at the rear of the field she began to make progress three furlongs out before being having to be switched to the right hampering a rival in the process, to make space for her challenge. She took the lea a furlong out and despite hanging left and right in the final strides she stayed on to win by half a length from Odeliz. Spencer commented \\"the race was very unsatisfactory... it was very, very tight where I was. Then she had to make a little bit of room for herself early in the stretch. I was trying to not give her too hard of a race because obviously this is basically a stepping stone to the Breeders' Cup. So the plan was just to win here and ship on down. She's won but I'd prefer if it had gone a little bit smoother.\\" Two weeks after her win in Canada, Just The Judge was sent to California to contest the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf at Santa Anita Park. She stayed on in the straight without being able to reach the lead and finished third behind Dayatthespa and Stephanie's Kitten with the favourite Dank in fourth. In December Just The Judge was put up for auction at Tattersalls and was bought for 4.5 million guineas by Qatar Racing & China Horse Club. The price was a record for a filly sold at public auction in Britain. As Qatar Racing had previously been partners in the ownership, the sale effectively saw the China Horse Club buying the Sangster Family's share. =2015: five-year-old season= On her first and only start for her new owners Just The Judge started a 28/1 outsider for the Sheema Classic over 2400 metres at Meydan Racecourse in Dubai on 28 March. Ridden by Andrea Atzeni she led the field into the straight before fading and finishing sixth of the nine runners behind Dolniya. After she suffered a tendon injury Just The Judge was retired from racing in July 2015. Hills said \\"All good things come to an end, but I'm very proud of Just The Judge's achievements. She's been a tremendously sound filly, and with three months' rest could have raced on, but she had nothing else to prove on the racecourse\\". Breeding record Just The Judge produced three foals. She died in April 2019 after undergoing surgery for colic.

It has received attention for articles on Donald Trump's presidency.  Background  The blog was started in September 2010 by Benjamin Wittes (a former editorial writer for The Washington Post), Harvard Law School professor Jack Goldsmith, and University of Texas at Austin law professor Robert Chesney. Goldsmith was the head of the Office of Legal Counsel in the George W. Bush administration's Justice Department, and Chesney served on a detention-policy task force in the Obama administration. Its writers include law professors, law students, and former George W. Bush and Barack Obama administration officials.  Donald Trump  Lawfare's coverage of intelligence and legal matters related to the Trump administration has brought the blog significant increases in readership and national attention. In January 2017, the website's traffic was up by 1,101% from 12 months before. = Executive Order 13769 = The blog came to prominence in January 2017 when President Donald Trump tweeted \\"LAWFARE\\" and quoted a line from one of its blog posts that criticized the reasoning in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that blocked Trump's first refugee-and- travel ban. Trump reportedly tweeted the excerpt minutes after the line was quoted on Morning Joe. Wittes, who supported the court ruling, criticized Trump harshly for the tweet, asserting that Trump distorted the argument presented in the article. Wittes also wrote that it was disturbing that Trump, among other things, cited the line \\"with apparently no idea who the author was or what the publication was, and indeed without reading the rest of the article\\", and that no one in the White House vetted the tweet. = Dismissal of FBI Director James Comey = On May 18, 2017, Lawfare's editor-in-chief Benjamin Wittes was the principal source of an extensive New York Times report about President Trump's interactions with FBI Director James Comey, and how those interactions related to Comey's subsequent firing. Wittes also provided a 25-minute interview to PBS NewsHour on the same subject. Comey had reportedly been \\"disgusted\\" with Trump's attempts to publicly ingratiate himself with Comey saw as calculated attempts to compromise him by agitating Democrats. Comey had also reportedly found that people in the Trump administration were \\"not honorable\\". Wittes elaborated on this shortly thereafter in a post on Lawfare. = Trump's disclosure of classified intelligence = In a widely read column, several Lawfare contributors argued that Trump's reported disclosure of classified intelligence to Russia in mid- May 2017 was \\"perhaps the gravest allegation of presidential misconduct in the scandal-ridden four months of the Trump administration.\\" The column further alleged that Trump's reported actions \\"may well be a violation of the President's oath of office.\\"  Reception  Journalist David Ignatius described Lawfare as \\"one of the most fair-minded chroniclers of national security issues.\\" According to Daniel W. Drezner, professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, Lawfare is an example of \\"outside intellectuals\\" who \\"exercised real influence in the Trump era.\\" The blog has been criticized by attorney and journalist Glenn Greenwald.

The church was consecrated to Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary to Elisabeth to the Hill Country. Shortly after its building-up, in 1430, it was burnt out by the Hussites. Within the years 1522 - 1588 it was restored by Ultraquists. Together with the town the church had to withstand a huge devastating fire in 1697 when it was completely destroyed.

During the conflict, he served as second lieutenant abroad . In 1745, an unprepared Anglesea was attacked and captured by a French warship. Phillips was court-martialed and executed for surrendering his ship while in command, his superiors having fallen to French fire. His court-martial was widely criticised and led to an amendment of the British Articles of War.  Naval service  On 28 March 1745, Anglesea sailed out of Kingsale, having landed her first Lieutenant, among others, due to illness and proceeded to the mouth of the English Channel. The warship was under the command of Captain Jacob Elton, and was tasked with patrolling the Channel for French shipping. On the afternoon of 29 March, a large sail was spotted windward (upwind) of Anglesea, with the vessel heading in the direction of the British warship. Believing the oncoming ship to be HMS Augusta, Captain Elton retired below deck to take his dinner. The ship quickly approached Anglesea, with it eventually being discovered that the ship flew French colours on her quarter. This was the 50-gun Apollon, which closed and prepared for action with the seemingly idle British warship. In the confusion aboard the British ship, Captain Elton ordered Anglesea's foresail raised in preparation for a retreat. The effect of this action was to blow the ship to one side and flood the lower gun decks. Apollon laid down a withering fire onto Anglesea, with the first broadside killing both Captain Elton and the master of the ship, leaving Second Lieutenant Baker Phillips in command. Several more minutes saw 60 men killed or wounded by French fire. Apollon was able to engage the crippled Anglesea from its leeward side, granting the French ship an advantage in manoeuvrability. With Anglesea unable to fight and with the ship taking on water, Phillips ordered the colours struck and surrendered the vessel.  Court-martial  Under the British Articles of War, Phillips was charged with the dishonourable surrendering of a vessel under his command to the enemy. Under Article 10, the military court sentenced Phillips to death for failing to put the ship in order for battle, for failing to encourage the officers and men of the vessel to fight courageously, for failing to do his utmost to command the vessel after the death of his superior officer, and for yielding his ship to an enemy. The court recommend that Philips should be treated mercifully on account of his youth and inexperience, writing: > ... was unanimously of opinion that Captain Elton, deceased, did not give > timely directions for getting his ship clear or in a proper posture of > defence, nor did be afterwards behave like an officer or a seaman, which was > the cause of the ship being left to Lieutenant Phillips in such distress and > confusion. And that Lieutenant Baker Phillips, late second lieutenant of the > said ship, by not endeavouring to the utmost of his power after Captain > Elton's death to put the ship in order of fighting, not encouraging the > inferior officers and common men to fight courageously, and by yielding to > the enemy, falls under part of the tenth article. They do sentence him to > death, to be shot by a platoon of musqueteers on the forecastle, ... but ... > having regard to the distress and confusion the ship was in when he came to > the command, and being a young man and unexperienced, they beg leave to > recommend him for mercy. An appeal against the sentence of death was refused, and Phillips was executed by firing squad on the forecastle of HMS Princess Royal at 11 am on 19 July 1745. The execution of Lieutenant Phillips was controversial. Many in Parliament believed that a captain or other high-ranking officer caught in his position would not have been executed. The incident led to the Articles of War being amended to ensure one law for all, with that law recommending the death penalty for any officer of any rank who did not do his utmost against the enemy in battle or pursuit.Hannay, David (1911). \\"Byng, John\\". In Chisholm, Hugh. Encyclopædia Britannica. 4 (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press The consensus within the Royal Navy was not that Phillips should have been spared execution, but rather that any commander, including high-ranking officers, should be executed if they surrendered or showed incompetence. Parliament on the other hand believed that Phillips was used as a scapegoat to cover the failures of a higher-ranking Royal Navy officer. The new laws enacted in the aftermath of Phillips' execution were cited as being the cause of the execution of British admiral John Byng in 1757.Laughton, John Knox (1887). Studies in Naval History.

Having grown up in Mumbai and living in Bengaluru, Parthasarathy is known for creating the webcomic Royal Existentials and writing for the webcomic Urbanlore. Parthasarathy became part of feminist art collective Kadak in March 2016, where she has collaborated to create Personal (Cyber) Space and Aloe Vera and The Void. Early life Having grown up in Mumbai, Aarthi Parthasarathy graduated in communication design at the Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology in Bengaluru and went on to become a writer and filmmaker. As a child, Parthasarathy read comics such as Tinkle, Amar Chitra Katha, the Adventures of Tintin, Asterix, and Calvin & Hobbes. Career Parthasarthy has described her aim when creating webcomics as being to \\"bring out historical and contemporary angst using vintage art.\\" She contrasts the historical imagery she uses with social or philosophical dialogue on contemporary issues. Parthasarthy finds herself unwilling to merchandise her work, and therefore does not sell any prints of her webcomics. =Royal Existentials= Inspired by David Malki's Wondermark, Parthasarathy started the webcomic Royal Existentials in November 2014. By overlaying Mughal miniature paintings with unique dialogue, Parthasarathy used this webcomic to comment upon various social and political events. She described her webcomic as a sort of \\"diary of thoughts\\", as she uses it to describe how she feels about whatever is keeping her mind occupied at the moment. =Urbanlore= In 2015, Parthasarathy started to collaborate with her friend Kaveri Gopalakrishnan in order to create Urbanlore, which captures the life in urban Indian cities, such as Bengaluru, by focusing on the history and culture of the people who live there. The two form a writer-artist duo in order to create Urbanlore, Parthasarathy writing the prose of the webcomic while Gopalakrishnan does the black-and-white drawings. The two also started an extension for the series, titled Urbanshorts, which comments on India's political affairs. Kadak Together with eight other South-Asian artists, Parthasarathy became part of online feminist art collective Kadak in March 2016. Describing the representation of female characters in older comics, such as Archie, as \\"problematic\\", Parthasarathy notes that there has been a cultural shift in how female characters are presented in comics. Animator and journalist Aindri Chakraborty found that an art collective made up entirely out of women of color could address the lack of diversity at Comic Cons and art festivals. Kadak creates gender-related pieces to present both online, on the website Medium, and in the physical world, through a kind of traveling library dubbed the \\"Reading Room\\". As part of Kadak, Parthasarathy collaborated with various other cartoonists to create short-form webcomics. In August 2016, she collaborated with Mira Malhotra to write Personal (Cyber) Space, a short webcomic that features a woman scrolling through her online news feed, coming across headlines about sexism, rape, as well as stories about a possible female president and women at the Olympics. The webcomic further comments upon the daily cycle of such news stories and how mass opinions have been turned into statistics. In September that same year, Parthasarathy collaborated with Renuka Rajiv to write Aloe Vera and The Void, which is presented as series of conversations about belief, God, and social exclusion.

Background  Lee revealed that she had initially thought that she would not have enough time to work on music as a mother, but noticed that motherhood gave her \\"a showering of inspiration and fuel\\". Thus, Lee revealed that except for the everyday errands, she still had time to be creative and record music for Dream Too Much. Lee said the album was going to feature only four or five songs as a sixtieth birthday present for her father, John Lee. However, her manager was approached by Amazon to do a full children's album, and she accepted it.

He took his PhD at the Norwegian Institute of Technology in 1989, called to full Professor 1997 and has since 2005 been Professor of Mathematics.  Research  The work of Munthe-Kaas is centred on applications of differential geometry and Lie group techniques in geometric integration and structure preserving algorithms for numerical integration of differential equations. A central aspect is the analysis of structure preservation by algebraic and combinatorial techniques (B-series and Lie–Butcher series). In the mid-1990s Munthe-Kaas developed what are now known as Runge–Kutta–Munthe-Kaas methods, a generalisation of Runge–Kutta methods to integration of differential equations evolving on Lie groups. The analysis of numerical Lie group integrators leads to the study of new types of formal power series for flows on manifolds (Lie–Butcher series). Lie–Butcher theory combines classical B-series with Lie- series. Algebraically, B-series are based on pre-Lie algebras, whereas the generalised Lie–Butcher series are based on the concept of post-Lie algebras. Applications in numerical integration on manifolds has led to fundamental research in the structure of post-Lie algebras and their relations to differential geometry, with ramifications in many different areas of applications.  Honors and awards  Munthe-Kaas received Exxon Mobil Award for best PhD at NTNU, 1989, and the Carl-Erik Frōberg Prize in Numerical Mathematics 1996 for the paper \\"Lie–Butcher theory for Runge–Kutta Methods\\". Munthe-Kaas is elected member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters and the Norwegian Academy of Technological Sciences. Munthe-Kaas is the chair of the international Abel prize committee (2018-2022), he is President of the Scientific Council of Centre International de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées (CIMPA) (2017–present) and he is Editor-in-Chief of Journal Foundations of Computational Mathematics (2017–present). Munthe-Kaas was secretary of Foundations of Computational Mathematics (2005–2011) and member of the Board of the Abel Prize in Mathematics (2010–2018).

It is endemic to southern Western Ghats in India. The species is named monticola (mountain dweller) considering the natural habitat where the species was discovered. The genus Protosticta has fifteen species reported from India, of which twelve are known from Western Ghats. This species was first found in 2014 in high altitudes (above 1600m) of the Anaimalai Hills of Idukki district, Kerala, southern Western Ghats. The study found the presence of this species in highland shola forest ecosystems of Kambilipparachola and Nagamalachola of Marayur forest division and Mathikettan Shola National Park. The males were found away from the forest streams, in shaded areas among the shola forest undergrowth at Kambilipparachola. A few females and males were also found frequenting the sides of streams covered with forest canopy near Nagamalachola in Marayur forests. A few female specimens were found in a forest stream inside the shola forest. Other species observed with them were Euphaea cardinalis and Esme cyaneovittata. This is the only species found within the high altitude shola forests of the southern Western Ghats. This is one of the small-sized Protosticta like Protosticta hearseyi. This species can be distinguished from other Protosticta species based on the completely black dorsal surface of its abdomen, 7th and 8th abdominal segments without yellow or blue color dorsally, and its distinct anal appendages.

The street runs west-to-east from the Battery Park City Esplanade along the Hudson River to Greenwich Street, passing through South End Avenue and West Street on the way. The street has a walkway connection to the Rector Street Bridge which crosses West Street.  History  According to maps drawn by David Valentine, the street did not exist before 1782. By 1789, it was a small extension of Thames Street. In 1797, the first pier on the west side of the island was built. The pier was used as the dock for the ferry between New York and Albany, hence the street leading to the pier was named \\"Albany Street\\". In the early 1850s, it was proposed that the street be extended through the yard next to Trinity Church in order to connect the street to Broadway. The proposition became the center of a heated debate between the Municipal Corporation of New York and the Religious Corporation of Trinity Church. When Battery Park City was built on landfill in the Hudson River in the 1980s, the street was extended west of West Street into the new development. 130 Cedar Street (left) and 90 West Street Buildings The Deutsche Bank Building was located on the north side of the street, but was heavily damaged in the September 11 attacks in 2001. The Alliance for Downtown New York and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation in 2014 redeveloped part of that site into a new public open space, the Albany Street Plaza. Buildings on Albany Street include the 90 West Street (1907), also known as the West Street Building, a New York City designated landmark designed by Cass Gilbert, and 130 Cedar Street, formerly the 12-story Green Exchange Building, designed by Renwick, Aspinwall & Guard and completed in 1931.

Description and history The Nettleton Hollow area was one of the first places to be settled in the 18th century in Washington. The Nettleton Hollow Road had been cut through the area, serving travelers between Hartford and Cornwall, where connections to the Albany, New York could be made. The presence of local cross roads presented the opportunity to establish taverns. One, the Rising Sun Tavern at 6 Romford Road, was established in 1748 and enlarged in the early 19th century, while a second (at 20 Nettleton Hollow Road) was established c. 1790. The area flourished until the stage routes declined in the later years of the 19th century. The historic district includes all of the property immediately surrounding the triangle formed by Nettletown Hollow Road, Sunny Ridge Road, and Old Litchfield Road. It includes ten houses, seven of which are historically significant, as well as a number of 19th-century outbuildings, including barns and sheds.

Founded in December 2014, the site was launched in January 2015 as a fork of Wikipedia. It is owned by Everipedia, Inc., a for-profit company headquartered in Westwood, Los Angeles, California. , the majority of Everipedia pages are copies of Wikipedia articles. The site's name is a portmanteau of the words \\"everything\\" and \\"encyclopedia\\". Everipedia aims to build the most accessible online encyclopedia, and not be as restrictive as Wikipedia. Everipedia adapted social media elements such as letting celebrities communicate with fans, and allows users to create pages on any topic as long as the content is cited and neutral. The site has been criticized for presenting false information on breaking news events, and for its original articles being focused on sensational topics such as YouTubers, and for its website heavily relying on JavaScript and AJAX for basic functionality such as viewing articles and opening references. The company uses EOS blockchain technology and a cryptocurrency token called IQ to encourage content generation and to stop certain countries from blocking its content. Everipedia launched on the EOS blockchain on August 9, 2018. On October 15, 2020 the Associated Press (AP) announced a partnership with Everipedia to verify the results of the 2020 United States elections. AP's results will be recorded on Everipedia’s blockchain database. According to AP’s director of data licensing Dwayne Desaulniers, Everipedia will publish the election's final results declared by AP after sufficient votes are counted.  History  Everipedia was founded in December 2014 and began as a small project of Sam Kazemian and Theodor Forselius in Kazemian's college dormitory room at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The encyclopedia launched in January 2015. Travis Moore joined the company as a co-founder in the winter of 2015 and Mahbod Moghadam joined as a co-founder in July 2015. In October 2015, George Beall was introduced to the founders of Everipedia at a conference at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. After selling his technology start-up Touch Tiles in January 2016, Beall joined the group of co-founders. In December 2017, the co-founder of Wikipedia, Larry Sanger, became the chief information officer of Everipedia, but he resigned in October 2019.  Company  Everipedia is owned and operated by the privately held Everipedia, Inc. The site's name is a portmanteau of the words \\"everything\\" and \\"encyclopedia\\". The company is headquartered in Westwood, Los Angeles, California near UCLA. The site depicts itself as \\"the encyclopedia of everything\\" and formerly as \\"everyone's encyclopedia\\". The company raised capital and received funding from angel investors. In July 2015, the company got its first seed funding from Mucker Capital and raised close to $130,000 from 201 investors on Wefunder. , they raised $700,000 from angel investors. It was announced on February 8, 2018, that the company raised $30 million in funding headed by Galaxy Digital's EOS.io Ecosystem Fund. In January 2017, they had eight full- time workers including two developers. By February 2018, headcount had increased to 15 full-time workers. In 2016, the site generated most of its revenue from advertisements. Also in 2017, there was a message at the bottom of every article stating, \\"Advertise\\" that directed to information for potential sponsors. The company aims to generate income through ways apart from donations or banners.  Blockchain  On December 6, 2017, the company announced plans to move to generating edits and storing information using the EOS blockchain. Everipedia also stated they were building a peer-to-peer wiki network that adds an incentive system by using cryptocurrency technology to incentivize editors with tokens that have legitimate monetary value. After the blockchain is implemented, the company plans to convert the points into a token currency. The tokenized system would let every user become a stakeholder in the wiki network. Each editor will put their token into play for each edit. If their contribution is accepted, the user gets back the token, which will have obtained value in proportion to the content added. If the edit is not accepted, the user does not get their token back. IQ Tokens were planned to be airdropped to the EOS list in February, with a network launch planned for June according to Forselius. Everipedia launched on the EOS blockchain on August 9, 2018. Everipedia says the blockchain model does not have centralized servers, therefore eliminating the cost of servers. As Everipedia is decentralized via blockchain, Forselius claims that it is not possible for governments to censor Everipedia by its assigned server IP addresses.  Content and users  , the majority of pages on Everipedia were copies of Wikipedia articles. Everipedia reportedly utilized a live Internet bot to monitor Wikipedia for changes, synchronizing such changes but giving preference to local edits on Everipedia. However, as of October 2017, articles were reportedly not updated as regularly as Wikipedia, and , most or all Everipedia articles originating as Wikipedia articles, including those never edited on Everipedia, had not had updated Wikipedia content applied since 2016. Everipedia allows for a larger range of articles than Wikipedia, as the English Wikipedia's notability guidelines are stricter than Everipedia's. Everipedia does not allow censorship on any topic for sourced articles. In March 2016, Everipedia had 200,000 published pages. Everipedia is ranked 29,017 globally (and 8,730 in the United States) for web traffic according to Alexa Internet, . There are communities in Brazil, China, Germany, and India. The company said in 2017 that Everipedia has 17,000 registered editors and 2,000 active editors as well as 3 million monthly users. In 2019, Kazemian said there were 7,000 active editors. Several dozen vandals have been banned from Everipedia. In a 2017 interview with Boing Boing, Kazemian claimed that the Everipedia community normally identifies a vandal in 5 minutes. The company has a group of editors who review the activity on the site and delete content that they consider suspicious. The site frequently focuses on trending topics, with the few articles created by users of the site mostly being about sensational topics such as YouTubers, memes, activists, white supremacists, and police shooting victims. The site has been criticized for initially presenting false information in wiki pages on breaking news topics. The incidents were identifying the wrong people in the 2017 Las Vegas shooting and the United Express Flight 3411 incident. Jeff John Roberts of The Outline raised concerns about the privacy ramifications of Everipedia, which developed many of its articles by gathering content from social media, creating publicly visible entries on non-notable individuals. Everipedia previously offered a service for a monthly fee that allows for users and businesses to create tailored Everipedia entries that get \\"full-time monitoring for updates and preventing vandalism\\".

A youth product of NEC, Sürmeli experienced his breakthrough as part of the Achilles '29 team competing in the second-tier Eerste Divisie. He later played for clubs in Turkey and Belgium. Club career =Early years= Starting his career as a youth player at SV Hatert and Quick 1888, Sürmeli moved the youth academy of NEC in 2008. After failing to make the cut, he moved to NEC's amateur branch. A few months later, he signed a contract, which made him a regular part of NEC Amateurs. =Achilles '29= On 18 June 2013, Sürmeli joined Eerste Divisie club Achilles '29 in June 2013, and made his professional debut on 24 August 2013 in a game against Almere City FC in the absence of team captain Twan Smits who was serving a suspension. More than a month later, he appeared in an away game against FC Den Bosch (0–2 win) in the final minutes coming on for Levi Raja Boean. A week later he came in as a substitute for Kay Thomassen and scored the equaliser against Jong PSV with a strike from distance. The match was eventually won 3–2. Two weeks later, against Willem II, he replaced Smits again, this time because he suffered hamstring injury. Sürmeli also started as a defensive midfielder against Fortuna Sittard and in a KNVB Cup match against AZ. In the winter break, head coach François Gesthuizen decided to a system which facilitated two defensive midfielders instead of one, opening up a spot for Sürmeli in the starting eleven. The first league match of 2014 featured Sürmeli and Jop van Steen as central defensive midfielders was won 2–1 against Almere City. Due to an injury, he missed the upcoming away match against FC Dordrecht (4–2) and was only used as a substitute at home against FC Emmen (0–0). After a month without appearances, he made six appearances in a row, where he was used as a substitute in five of them. Sürmeli played the last four games of the season as a starter. In the first ten matches of the following season, Sürmeli was a starter eight times and a used substitute once. On 28 September 2014, he scored two goals in the 0–4 away win at RKC Waalwijk and played the full 90 minutes: he scored the 0–1 and the 0–3 goals. Against MVV, he lost his starting spot due to an injury and he was benched for the next eight matches, although he came in as a substitute in seven of them. One of these matches, on 12 December, in the home game against VVV-Venlo (3–0), he scored the last goal as a substitute. After the winter break, he began as a starter on right midfield. On 2 March 2015, Sürmeli scored his fifth goal for Achilles, and his fourth of the season, in a match against Telstar with a long distance strike. Two and a half weeks later, he headed in the 2–1 lead against Almere City from a cross by Twan Smits, in a match that ended 3–1. In the 2016–17 season, he suffered relegation from the Eerste Divisie with Achilles '29, after which he left as a free agent. After turning down offers from Italian Serie B club Carpi, and Turkish clubs Adanaspor and Adana Demirspor, he decided to stay with Achilles '29 in August. =Adanaspor and Lienden= In early January 2018, Sürmeli triggered a release clause to leave Achilles '29 in the winter break, after the club had filed for bankruptcy, and join Turkish TFF First League club Adanaspor. After making no appearances for the side he had his contract terminated at the end of the month, and he joined Dutch Tweede Divisie club FC Lienden on 31 January. =Giresunspor and Winkel Sport= From the 2018–19 season, Sürmeli had an agreement to join De Treffers. At the end of July 2018, he left De Treffers before the start of the competition and signed a two-year contract with Giresunspor of the TFF First League. At the beginning of January 2019, he had his contract terminated as he had not received his salary. Afterwards, he had a deal with Osmanlıspor, but due to an injury the club refused to formalise the agreement and Sürmeli was leaved as a free agent. On 12 July 2019, Sürmeli joined Winkel Sport, a team competing in the third-tier Belgian First Amateur Division. =Dordrecht= On 20 August 2020, Sürmeli returned to the Netherlands where he signed a one-year contract with FC Dordrecht.

Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1951), vol. ii, part iii, p. 154. he trained in astronomy under John Couch Adams at a local observatory. In 1866, he was invited to oversee the construction of the Great Melbourne Telescope at the Grubb factory in Dublin. Le Sueur wrote that he felt he had little \\"special knowledge\\" in the field of astronomy, but would endeavour to prove himself capable to his clients. In the meantime, he was coached in celestial photography by Warren de la Rue and immersed himself in the intricacies of building the telescope.R. Gillespie, The Great Melbourne Telescope (Victoria Museums Publishing, ebook, 2011). In 1868, he supervised its transportation to and erection in Melbourne; despite being a talented astronomer, drawer and photographer, he clashed with Robert Ellery, the telescope's director, and returned home in 1870. His successor was Farie Macgeorge, who proved LeSueur's work had transformed the denigrated telescope into a first-class instrument.

Background  = Definition = Net metering refers to the interconnection of a renewable energy system to the power grid. It allows consumers who have their own renewable generation power systems to connect to the power grid with an electric meter that spins both forwards and backwards, depending on whether the consumer is adding energy to the grid or using energy from the grid. At the end of the month, the customer’s bill is based on the net amount of power that is drawn from the grid, minus the credits for excess power put into the grid. In New Mexico, customers who have systems that produce up to 80 MW of electricity are able to sign up for net metering. This is the highest power rating eligible for net metering in the United States. The three main utilities in New Mexico are PNM, Xcel Energy and El Paso Electric. = Benefits of net metering = One benefit of net metering is that power is never wasted. When someone uses an isolated system that uses batteries that become fully charged while the system is still generating power, that excess power is wasted. Customer-generators, businesses and industrial operations can qualify for net metering. Customer-generators have the added benefit of selling renewable energy credits (REC) back to their utility. (A customer- generator is a small producer—that is not an electric utility—of electricity which is net metered and connected to the electric grid. An example would be a homeowner who puts solar panels on his rooftop.http://www.puc.state.pa.us/general/consumer_ed/pdf/Home_Alt_Energy_FS.pdf) = Utility-scale solar vs. residential solar = A utility-scale solar facility is a large facility that generates solar power and moves that power into the electric grid. Almost every utility-scale solar facility has what is known as a power purchase agreement with the utility. The agreement guarantees a market for the utility-scale solar facility’s energy for a fixed term of time. (Residential solar systems are not considered utility-scale). The size of a utility-scale facility can vary. For example, some utility-scale facilities provide only enough power per megawatt to power a few hundred average homes. Others offer a lot more energy. Factors that play into this are location, the type of technology used, and the availability of sunlight. For example, although not located in New Mexico, Recurrent Energies’ “Sunset Reservoir” project in San Francisco produces 5 megawatts of solar energy. It is built on top of enclosed reservoir in the middle of San Francisco. It is considered a utility-scale solar facility.  How it works  = Net excess generation = For customers with solar systems that can generate 10 kilowatts or less, the utility company has a choice in how they compensate that customer for net excess generation. The utility can give the customer a credit on their next bill equal to the utility’s energy rate (the costs that the utility pays for its own electricity), or crediting the customer for the kilowatt hours of electricity that they have supplied back to utility through the grid. = Technical = In New Mexico, a few technical requirements exist in order for a net metering system to be connected to the grid. First, the net metering system should have a visible means of disconnection allowing the utility to disconnect to system from the grid. Second, a net meter is required and should cost no more than $20. Third, there needs to be an inverter that disconnects when the grid goes down. The system capacity limit is 80 megawatts. = Eligibility = In New Mexico the types of renewable technologies eligible for net metering are the following: * Combined Heat & Power * Fuel cells using Non-Renewable Fuels * Fuel cells using Renewable Fuels * Geothermal Electric * Hydroelectric * Hydroelectric (Small) * Landfill gas * Microturbines * Municipal solid waste * Solar photovoltaics * Solar thermal electric * Wind (All), Biomass * Wind (Small) Sectors that can use net metering include commercial, industrial, local government, nonprofits, residential homes, schools, state and federal government, agricultural, and institutional. The types of utilities that can participate in net metering are investor-owned utilities and electric cooperatives. Utilities that can participate are investor-owned utilities and electric cooperatives. When a customer leaves the utility, the utility must pay the customer for any unused credits. = Availability and jurisdiction = According to DSIRE, “Net metering is available to all \\"qualifying facilities\\" (QFs), as defined by the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), which pertains to renewable energy systems and combined heat and power systems up to 80 megawatts (MW) in capacity. There is no statewide cap on the aggregate capacity of net-metered systems.” Additionally, all utilities that are subject regulation under the Public Regulation Commission’s (PRC) jurisdiction must offer net metering. Municipal utilities, which are not regulated by the PRC, are exempt.  Solar in New Mexico  = Growth = In New Mexico, the decrease in prices for solar systems is driving the market for it. Many homeowners and commercial companies are purchasing solar systems to help offset the increase in electric utility bills. More financing options are available today in New Mexico, more solar companies are competing, and this is leading to an increase in market penetration. The growth is predicted at 20% per year. As of early 2016, the market in the United States for solar systems had reached 1 million solar installations. This is equivalent to generating enough electricity to power 5.4 million homes, according to the national Solar Energy Industry Association. According to the Albuquerque Journal, “New Mexico ranks 8th in the nation today in terms of installed solar capacity per capita.” It is estimated that the solar market in New Mexico has only experienced approximately 10% of market penetration. = Solar capacity and statistics = According to the Albuquerque Journal, “As of year-end 2015, New Mexico had about 400 megawatts of installed capacity. That includes 85 MW of residential and commercial systems, and 316 MW of utility-scale generation scattered throughout the service territories of New Mexico’s public utilities and electric cooperatives.” For all the installed solar capacity in the New Mexico, the Public Service Company of New Mexico accounts for around 41% of that. Their facilities include fifteen different projects with a total of 107 MW of capacity, which according to the company, provides enough power 140,000 average homes. New Mexico requires public utilities to get 15% of their electric generation from renewable sources. That number will increase to 20% by the year 2020. Within the state, sixty different contracting and installation companies operate. These firms include national companies like SolarCity and ZingSolar.  Consumer incentives  = State tax credit = Up until the end of 2016, New Mexico offered a 10% state tax credit for solar installations. The tax credit began in 2008. Solar companies operating in New Mexico say they are okay to absorb the loss of the state tax credit, meaning that they don't believe it will affect their business. However, in addition to the loss of the tax credit, renewable energy payments from utilities to customers is also declining. = Federal tax credit = In addition to the state tax credit, which is over, the U.S. government gives a 30 percent tax credit for solar installations. In December 2015, Congress extended the program through the end of 2019. = Payments from utilities = PNM and El Paso Electric Co. in southern New Mexico paid customers for each kilowatt hour of electricity they produced from their solar systems. These payments help customers and businesses offset the costs of installing their solar systems. In addition to the payments, those companies offer net metering. Under net metering, people with solar systems can sell their excess electricity back to the utility company at a price equal to what the utility pays for its own electricity. Note that net metering is a separate system of payments from the renewable payments that utilities offer back to customers. For example, 7,100 customers have signed up for the renewable payments from the utility PNM. In 2014, that number was only 4,400 customers. Payments from utilities back to customers decreased from $.13 per kilowatt hour in 2009 to $.025 by the end of 2015. As of the middle of 2016, PNM stopped accepting new applications because the number of people seeking the credits was more than the money available in the program. According to DSIRE, a program operated by the N.C. Clean Energy Technology Center at North Carolina State University funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, “If a customer has NEG [net energy generation] totaling less than $50 during a monthly billing period, the excess is carried over to the customer’s next monthly bill. If NEG exceeds $50 during a monthly billing period, the utility will pay the customer the following month for the excess. “The energy rate to be paid for the energy supplied by the QF [qualifying facility] in any month shall be the respective month's rate from the utility's current schedule on file with the PRC. Each utility shall file with the PRC its schedule containing monthly energy rates that will be applicable to the next twelve-month period.”  Price of solar installation  According to a study by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, prices for the installation of residential and utility-scale solar generation plants went down by more than 50 percent between 2008 and 2014. In 2015, prices fell another 17 percent. As of 2017, an average New Mexico residential system producing 4.4 kilowatts costs approximately $17,000 before tax credits and other incentives. After credits and incentives, the system would cost approximately $11,900. In 2009, that same system had cost $30,000. If a consumer chose to finance the system, they could pay around $99 a month.  Regulatory rules  In New Mexico there are two primary rules that govern the interconnection of a solar system to the utility grid: * NMPRC Rule 570 (general interconnection of qualifying facilities—larger solar-producing facilities) * NMPRC Rule 571 (net metering for small renewable energy systems) According to the New Mexico Solar Energy Association, “These rules apply wherever electricity service is regulated by the PRC. This includes the areas serviced by New Mexico's four investor owned utilities (IOUs) (which encompasses Santa Fe and Albuquerque for example), and the areas services by electric coops. It does not include municipal utilities (such as Los Alamos and Farmington), which are self- regulated.” Additionally, “If the net-metered facility uses more power than it produces over a billing period, the utility may bill the customer for the net power used according to the rate structure that would apply to the customer if they had not connected as a net-metering facility.”  Future of net metering in New Mexico  The solar industry in New Mexico is facing hurdles. Most utilities want to reduce incentives like net metering and charge customers more who have solar systems. The reason they want to do this is because the utilities maintain that their role in generating plants, transmitting and distributing electricity through distribution lines, and other fixed costs remain unchanged. They argue that solar customers are not financially contributing to those fixed costs.

The stables at the back of the building are thought to be haunted with several reports of people hearing carriages moving into the stables. The premises reportedly house the ghost of a dog with many people hearing ephemeral barking at night. There are also many stories of children being spotted within the building due to the buildings tenure as a school and hostel. *The Old Gaol (Grahamstown): Built in Grahamstown in 1824, the Old Gaol was a prison when martial law ruled in the old town. “Dead men walking” - those sentenced to death - were led from the Old Goal to the military parade ground for public hanging. The last victim of such a death was Henry Nicholls, executed in 1862 after being convicted of rape. That this was not an offence punishable by death is, some say, the reason for his restlessness. Now his spirit is supposedly doomed to repeat the sombre walk - back and forth from gaol to gallows - perhaps for eternity. *Somerset Hospital: South Africa's oldest hospital in Green Point, Cape Town, where resident ghosts reportedly include Sister Henrietta Stockdale, a blonde girl combing her hair and others that roam the corridors at night. * Grey High School in Port Elizabeth is well known for its paranormal occurrences. Tales of the school's past rectors that wander the corridors at night and past matrons that haunt the boarding house are frequent and numerous. * Old Jail in Philippolis Found in the heart of the oldest town in the Free-State, the old jail of Philippolis is said to be one of the most haunted places in South-Africa. Once used as a barracks for military to a jail. Story goes that after a Giekwa got in a car accident they took his body to the jail and he died in one of the cells. Up until this day you can hear him play the violin.

The confrontation was between an ill- planned English punitive expedition led by Major-General Sir George Cathcart and the native forces of the Sotho chief Moshoeshoe and resulted in the English forces being repulsed. Prelude Moshoeshoe I Following the defeat of an ill-armed and inadequate punitive force at Viervoet the previous year by the Sotho tribe of Basutoland under their leader Moshoeshoe, the British Major-General Cathcart gathered together at Platberg in the Free State an overpowering force of over 2,000 men. The force consisted of infantry detachments of the 2nd (The Queen's Royal) Regiment of Foot, the 43rd (Monmouthshire) Regiment of Foot, the 73rd (Highland) Regiment of Foot Regiment, the 74th (Highland) Regiment of Foot and the 1st Battalion, The Rifle Brigade supported by cavalry and artillery. Believing that such a force would totally overawe the Sotho tribe, Cathcart demanded reprisals of 10,000 cattle and 1000 horses within 3 days, threatening to march into Moshoeshoe's heartland and collect any unpaid debt by force. Only 3000 cattle were delivered in the time allowed and Cathcart therefore organised the threatened invasion. He opted to take only half his available strength, about 1000 men, leaving behind the 2nd Foot, most of the 74th Foot, some of his cavalry and his smaller artillery. No spare ammunition for the infantry would be taken. Invasion Major-Gen. Sir George Cathcart Moshoeshoe had established his headquarters on the steep-sided Berea plateau at Thaba Bosiu in the Phuthiatsana valley. Cathcart's tactics were to advance on Thaba Bosiu in three widely separated columns and link up at midday in front of the stronghold. Any available cattle were to be rounded up and driven back to base. The left column of 233 cavalry under Lieutenant-Colonel G.T.C. Napier of the Cape Mounted Rifles, made up of elements of the 12th Royal Lancers and the Cape Mounted Rifles, were to circumnavigate the Berea plateau to the east. The main column under Sir William Eyre were to cross the reamohetse sello′s plateau and the right column under Cathcart would skirt the plateau to the west. In the event Napier's column, accompanied by captured cattle, were ambushed and forced to return to base. Eyre's column was also so engrossed in rounding up cattle that they were hours late arriving at the rendezvous, having also been harried by Moshoeshoe's cavalry. Cathcart's column arrived safely at Thaba Bosiu to find themselves surrounded at a safe distance by thousands of Sotho mounted cavalry. He was later joined by Eyre's troops and retreated to a safe place to make camp for the night. The following day they made their way back to the border. Aftermath Cathcart had lost the use of his cavalry, had a significant number of men killed and had limited ammunition. He could not have been sure of defeating the enemy. Moshoeshoe had lost some 5000 cattle but would have realised that had he attacked in numbers and defeated the British force he would inevitably have been subsequently overpowered by a larger one. However Moshoeshoe was also under threat from other tribes and from Boer encroachment and decided to sue for peace with the British, ultimately requesting the protection of the British Crown.

He was a prolific author on a range of Biblical topics and church history. Campbell died in January 2017, and it subsequently emerged that he killed himself amid allegations of multiple extra-marital affairs. Biography Iain Donald Campbell was born on 20 September 1963 on the Isle of Lewis to John Norman Campbell and his wife Lily Maciver (née Mackenzie). Campbell had two sisters, Margaret and Alma.https://freechurch.org/news/funeral-arrangements-and- obituary-for-rev-dr-iain-d-campbell Campbell attended the Nicolson Institute, a school on Lewis, before studying at the University of Glasgow, where he graduated with First Class Honours in Arts in 1985. He then pursued theological studies at the Free Church College and the University of London, again graduating with First Class Honours as a Bachelor of Divinity. He studied for a PhD at the University of Edinburgh and was awarded his doctorate in 2001. A version of his thesis, on George Adam Smith, was subsequently published in book form. Campbell married Anne Macsween Davidson, born in 1962 and also from the Isle of Lewis, in 1984 in Stornoway. They had three children together: Iain, Stephen, and Emily. His first pastoral position was at Snizort Free Church on Skye, which he commenced in 1988. In 1995, he moved to the Free Church at Back on the Isle of Lewis. Finally, in 2009, he became minister of Point Free Church, also on Lewis. In 2012, he served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland. Campbell wrote about 17 books on topics related to Christianity, including Bible studies and doctrinal teaching, mostly published through Christian Focus Publications and Day One Publications. He also contributed to Tabletalk magazine published by Ligonier Ministries. At the time of his death, in addition to his ministerial role, he was vice-chairman of the board of Edinburgh Theological Seminary, editor of The Record, the monthly magazine of the Free Church of Scotland, and an associate editor of Foundations, a theological journal published by Affinity. He was also an Adjunct Professor of Church History at Westminster Theological Seminary, helping to deliver their London-based courses. Death Campbell died on 28 January 2017 at the age of 53, by suicide. An early obituary, written by long-standing Free Church minister Donald Macleod, and published two days after Campbell's death, suggested Campbell was experiencing pain which may have affected the balance of his mind, but did not elaborate further. An early report stated that Campbell's wife, Anne, had discovered emails on his computer and accused him of having several extra-marital affairs with members of his congregation. Two later stories in the Sunday Times, on 12 March 2017, presented a slightly different version of events. They stated that the initial reports were not correct and that Campbell had confessed his infidelity to his wife before taking his own life. She then found the emails on Campbell's computer.

Māru-Gurjara architecture, Chaulukya style or Solaṅkī style,Hegewald, note 3. Mitchell (1977) uses \\"Solanki style\\", while Harle is reluctant to tie the style to a specific name. is a style of north Indian temple architecture that originated in Gujarat and Rajasthan from the 11th to 13th centuries, under the Chaulukya dynasty (or Solaṅkī dynasty).Mitchell (1977), 123; Hegewald Although originating as a regional style in Hindu temple architecture, it became especially popular in Jain temples and, mainly under Jain patronage, later spread across India and to diaspora communities around the world.Hegewald On the exteriors, the style is distinguished from other north Indian temple styles of the period in \\"that the external walls of the temples have been structured by increasing numbers of projections and recesses, accommodating sharply carved statues in niches. These are normally positioned in superimposed registers, above the lower bands of moldings. The latter display continuous lines of horse riders, elephants, and kīrttimukhas. Hardly any segment of the surface is left unadorned.\\" The main shikhara tower usually has many urushringa subsidiary spirelets on it, and two smaller side-entrances with porches are common in larger temples.Hegewald Mandapa ceiling in the Ranakpur Jain Temple Interiors are if anything even more lavishly decorated, with elaborate carving on most surfaces. In particular, Jain temples often have small low domes carved on the inside with a highly intricate rosette design. Another distinctive feature is \\"flying\\" arch-like elements between pillars, touching the horizontal beam above in the centre, and elaborately carved. These have no structural function, and are purely decorative. The style developed large pillared halls, many open at the sides, with Jain temples often having one closed and two pillared halls in sequence on the main axis leading to the shrine.Hegewald; Harle, 219–220 Devotions in the Swaminarayan temple in Houston, Texas (2004) The style mostly fell from use in Hindu temples in its original regions by the 13th century, especially as the area had fallen to the Muslim Delhi Sultanate by 1298. But, unusually for an Indian temple style, it continued to be used by Jains there and elsewhere, with a notable \\"revival\\" in the 15th century.Harle, 239–240; Hegewald Since then it has continued in use in Jain and some Hindu temples, and from the 20th century has spread to temples built outside India by the Jain diaspora, such as the Jain temple, Antwerp, Belgium (completed 2010), and temples in Potters Bar and Leicester in England.Hegewald Origin of the name The name of the Māru-Gurjara style is a 20th-century invention; previously, and still by many, it is called the \\"Solanki style\\".Hegewald, note 3 The ancient name of Rajasthan was Marudesh while Gujarat was called Gurjaratra. The term \\"Māru- Gurjara\\" was coined by art and architectural historian Madhusudan Dhaky, who also coined the terms \\"Surāṣṭra\\", \\"Mahā-Māru\\", and \\"Mahā-Gurjara\\" to describe other historical styles of Western Indian architecture. The Māru-Gurjara style is a synthesis of the Mahā-Māru style of Marwar region in Rajasthan and the Mahā-Gurjara style of Gujarat. However, Hegewald suggests \\"This change in terminology appears to have been suggested first by A. Ghosh during a symposium in Delhi in 1967\\".Hegewald, note 3, citing \\"Pramod Chandra \\"The Study of Indian Tempe Architecture\\", in Studies in Indian Temple Architecture, ed. Pramod Chandra (New Delhi: American Institute of Indian Studies, 1975), 36\\" She notes that the change was an \\"attempt to avoid dynastic terms\\", and that both \\"Māru-Gurjara\\" and \\"Maru-Gurjara\\" are used by different writers, and that the Jain community mostly continues to call the style \\"Solanki\\".Hegewald, note 3 Development Bands of relief on the base wall of the Jagdish Temple, Udaipur, built by Maharana Jagat Singh I in 1651 The style developed from that of the dynasties preceding the Solankis, mainly the Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty, and the local dynasties under it. The most famous monuments of this period are the Khajuraho Group of Monuments built under the Chandela dynasty between 950 and 1050. These are famous for their erotic reliefs. Many of the broad features of this earlier style are continued in the Māru-Gurjara style. The beginnings of the new style can be seen in the small Ambika Mata temple in Jagat, Rajasthan. The earliest inscription here records a repair in 961 (well before the Solankis came to power).Harle, 220–221; Mitchell (1990), 288 For George Mitchell, in the Jagat temple (and others he names) \\"the Pratihara style was fully evolved in its Western Indian expression\\".Mitchell (1990), 263 =Early Hindu temples= The Somnath temple, dedicated to Shiva, was the most famous in Gujarat, but was very largely destroyed by the Ghaznavid ruler Mahmud in a raid in 1024–1025 CE. It was then rebuilt, but sacked again when the Delhi Sultanate conquered the area at the end of the 13th century.Rowland, 293–294 The ruins have recently been restored and rebuilt in what is intended as the Solanki style. The Sun Temple, Modhera, Gujarat, was built in 1026–27 CE, just after Mahmud's raid. The shikhara is now missing, but the lower levels are well-preserved, and there is a large stepwell tank of the same period in front of the temple. There is a large detached mandapa between the main sanctuary building and the tank, which is slightly later. The carving of all parts is \\"extremely luxuriant and exquisitely refined in the rendering of detail\\".Rowland, 294–296, 296 quoted; Michell (1990), 299–300; Harle, 223–227 The Rudra Mahalaya Temple was a large complex in Siddhpur Gujarat, mostly destroyed under Muslim rule. The main temple was surrounded by a screen of subsidiary shrines (partly surviving as a mosque), and the porches, parts of which remain, and a stand-alone torana were exceptionally grand. The mandapa had three storeys. It was completed in 1140, ending a long period of construction.Michell (1990), 300; Harle, 227–228 Two groups of smaller ruined temples of similar date are the two Rama Lakshamana temples, Baradia and the five Kiradu temples; both have their lowest storeys fairly intact, and some of the Kiradu group retain part of their shikharas.Michell (1990), 295–296 (Kiradu, which he sees as mostly \\"late Pratihara\\"; Harle, 223–227 The famous Rani ki vav (\\"Queen's Stepwell\\", probably 1063–83) is a very grand stepwell in Patan, Gujarat, once the Solanki capital. With a very different architectural form and function, \\"throughout, the ornamentation of the architectural elements is sumptuous\\" in the contemporary temple style, including very many Hindu figures. Another non-temple is the 80 foot Kirti Stambha tower in Chittor Fort, Rajasthan, built for a Jain merchant, mostly in the early 13th century, with the pavilion at the top a 15th-century restoration.Michell (1990), 283; Harle, 227–228 File:Jagat 22-76 (cropped).jpgAmbika Mata temple in Jagat, Rajasthan, by 960 File:Ambika-Tempel (Jagat)3.jpgDurga on the Jagat temple File:Sun Temple, Modhera Gudhamandapa with annotation of exterior mouldings.jpgWall below the shikhara, Sun Temple, Modhera, 1020s File:રૂદ્રમહલ.jpgOutside face of screen shrines at Rudra Mahalaya Temple, by 1140 File:The Kiradu Temples in perspective (cropped).jpgKiradu temples File:Rani ki vav1.jpgRani ki vav, Patan, Gujarat, 11th century =Early Jain temples= Detail of the Jain Kirti Stambha tower, Chittor Fort Ajitanatha Temple, Taranga Jain temples, 1161 Bhadreshwar Jain Temple, 1248, rebuilt 2010 The five Dilwara Temples on Mount Abu are among the most famous Jain temples. The Vimal Vasahi is much the earliest, constructed by 1031, with the Luna Vasahi by 1230, and the others at intervals between 1459 and 1582. All are in a very white marble that adds greatly to their effect, and remain in use. The oldest and largest two have large amounts of intricate carving even by the standards of the style, reaching a peak in the Luna Vasahi temple. The main buildings of the first three named are surrounded by \\"cloister\\" screens of devakulikā shrines, and are fairly plain on the outer walls of these; in the case of the Vimal Vasahi this screen was a later addition, around the time of the second temple. These three have an axis from the sanctuary through a closed, then an open mandapa to an open rangamandapa, or larger hall for dance or drama.Michell (1990), 274–276; Harle, 226–227 Surrounding the main temple with a curtain of shrines was to become a distinctive feature of the Jain temples of West India, still employed in some modern temples.Harle, 228 The Ajitanatha Temple, the largest and earliest of the cluster of Taranga Jain temples, was constructed in 1161, and is a fine example of the style, which remains largely intact, and in religious use. The shikhara and the much lower superstructure over the mandapa are both among the \\"most complicated\\" in the style. The former begins with three rows of bhumija-style miniature towers in clusters, before turning to the sekhari style higher up, where the miniature towers are of varying lengths, and overlap. Over the mandapa, the lowest level continues the regular miniature tower clusters over the sanctuary, above which shallow pitched planes of roof are studded with miniature towers, with rows of beasts and urns along the edges of the planes. The surfaces are heavily decorated with figures and \\"honeycomb\\" gavaksha decoration, the figures \\"characterized by lively poses and sharply cut faces and costumes\\".Michell (1990), 310–311, 311 quoted The Ajitanatha Temple was built under, and very probably by, King Kumarapala (r. 1143 – 1172 CE) of the Solanki/Chaulukya dynasty, who was the most favourable towards Jains of the dynasty. According to Jain sources he converted to Jainism towards the end of his life; at the least he was influenced by the religion. His reign marked the height of Jain power and influence; his son Ajayapala, something of a villain in Jain chronicles, was much less favourable, although there continued to be Jain ministers.Hegewald Kumbharia Jain temples is a complex of five Jain temples in Kumbhariya, Banaskantha district built between 1062 - 1231 CE. The five temples are famous for their elaborate architecture. The Jain temples, Kumbhariya along with Dilwara temples, Girnar Jain temples and Taranga Jain temple are considered excellent examples of Chaulukyan architecture. Mahavira, Shantinatha, and Parshvanatha temples are some of the most renowned temples in India. These five marble temples vary in size and architecture details, but every temple is surrounded by a protective walled courtyard with elaborate arched gateways. The Bhadreshwar Jain Temple, mostly constructed for a merchant in 1248, just at the end of the Solanki dynasty, is surrounded by the high walls of a curtain of subsidiary shrines, each with a shikhara in sekhari style, except for a much later two-storey porch at the entrance, which has elements from Indo-Islamic architecture in the domes and arches. The main temple, in a courtyard considerably above ground level, is comparable to the earlier examples described above.Michell (1990), 280; Hegewald The clustered group of Girnar Jain temples, with a magnificent mountain-top position, are mostly in the style, with the major temples ranging in date (of basic construction) from 1128, 1231, 1453 and another 15th century example.Michell (1990), 294; Hegewald Other temples, like the large example at the Rajgadhi Timbo (\\"mound\\"), have been completely destroyed. =Later temples= Ranakpur Jain temple, 15th century The Solanki dynasty finally fell around 1244, replaced by the Hindu Vaghela dynasty for some decades before the Muslim Delhi Sultanate conquered the region. Temple building then largely ceased in the original areas of the style for a considerable time, although a trickle of repairs and additions to existing temples are recorded, and some small new buildings. However, Solanki rule came to be seen by Jains as something of a \\"golden age\\", and the Māru-Gurjara style evidently became something of a standard for Jains, specifically the Śvetāmbara wing of the religion. The style began to re-appear in Jain temples in the same area in the 15th century, and then spread elsewhere in India, initially moving eastwards.Hegewald Ranakpur Jain temple, 15th century The Adinatha Ranakpur Jain temple in Rajasthan is a major construction for a merchant, built between 1439 and 1458 or 1496. It is a thorough-going, but not strict, revival of Māru-Gurjara style, on the same broad model as Bhadreshwar, with a high outside wall of the back of shrines, but also a number of Islamic-style corbelled domes. There are four three-storey porches, already up two flights of steps. The interior of the temple is \\"unsurpassed for its spatial complexity\\", with the sanctuary at the centre of the compound surrounded by many mandapas of two or three storeys, with all levels very open between the supporting columns allowing views in several directions inside the compound. Even the shikhara has balconies at three levels. The carving on the interior is in most areas as lavish as ever.Michell (1990), 305–306; Hegewald The large group of Palitana temples on the Shatrunjaya hills in Gujarat are another very important Jain pilgrimage site, with temples numbering into the hundreds (most very small, and all but one Svetambara). Though many were founded much earlier, the site was so thoroughly destroyed by Muslim armies, starting in 1311, that there is little surviving that dates back before the 16th century. The temples are packed tightly together in a number of high-walled compounds called \\"tuks\\" or \\"tonks\\". Michell calls them \\"characteristic of the final phase of Western Indian temple architecture\\", with traditional shikharas, double storey porches, often on three or four sides, and miniature-urn roofs to the main mandapas. But there are influences from Indo-Islamic architecture in the domes, often fluted, over porches and second mandapas, \\"arches with petalled fringes, parapets of merlons\\", and other features.Michell (1990), 308–310, 308 quoted The Polo Forest in Gujarat has groups of Hindu and Jain ruined temples of various dates, but mostly 15th century.Michell (1990), 273 The Jagdish Temple, Udaipur (completed 1651) is an example of a Hindu temple using the style at a late date; in this case a commission of Jagat Singh I, ruler of Mewar.Michell (1990), 311; Hegewald File:Jain temples on Girnar mountain aerial view.jpgSeven of the Girnar Jain temples, 12th-15th centuries File:Balabhai Tonk.jpgView across the Palitana temples File:Jagdish mandir 1.jpgThe Hindu Jagdish Temple, Udaipur (completed 1651) 19th century Hutheesing Jain Temple (1848) in Ahmedabad, Gujarat There was a considerable number of new Jain temples in the 19th century, as the Jain community continued to grow and prosper. By now temples were built by wealthy Jains, often individually, or by community trusts. The large Hutheesing Jain Temple (1848) in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, was built by the Hutheesing family. It uses the Māru-Gurjara style, with many similarities to Bhadreshwar and Ranakpur. There is a good deal of \\"sharply sculpted\\" decoration, \\"but figures appear only at the brackets\\". There are three sanctuaries in a row, and so three shikharas, but the porch and the outer mandapa each have three domes.Michell (1990), 278 (quoted); Hegewald But the style is not invariably used: the large Ajmer Jain temple (1864–1895) in Rajasthan uses a kind of Neo-Mughal style. This is a Digambar foundation, and the Digambar wing of Jainism always favoured the Māru-Gurjara style rather less, at least in India itself. The large Anandji Kalyanji Trust, which devotes itself to temple-building and renovation, has played a role in promoting the Māru-Gurjara style, at Palitana in particular.Hegewald 20th century The 20th and 21st centuries, especially from about 1950, have seen increasing Jain diaspora communities in many parts of the world. In India there has been much construction of large temples and complexes, and the smaller diaspora communities have constructed buildings on a somewhat smaller scale. In both cases use of the Māru-Gurjara style is very common, although the thoroughness with which it is adopted varies greatly. Some buildings mix Māru-Gurjara elements with those of local temple styles and modern international ones. Generally, where there is elaborate carving, often still done by craftsmen from Gujarat or Rajasthan, this has more ornamental and decorative work than small figures. A similar mix is seen in many modern Hindu temples in India and abroad, for example those of the Swaminarayan sect, or the Prem Mandir, Vrindavan near Mathura (built 2001-2011). Sometimes the Māru-Gurjara influence is limited to the \\"flying arches\\" and mandapa ceiling rosettes, and a preference for white marble.Hegewald File:Jain Temple, Kakinada.jpgEntrance fronting an essentially modern Jain temple building, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh File:Bonter Jinalaya, Koday - panoramio.jpgThe Bounter Jinalaya (or \\"72 Jinalaya\\") Jain temple at Mandvi, Kutch, Gujarat, begun 1982 File:Templejaindanvers.jpgThe Jain temple, Antwerp, Belgium, completed 2010 File:The Jain Centre on Oxford Street - geograph.org.uk - 1034296.jpgThe Jain Centre, Leicester, England.

Background The Māru-Gurjara style did not represent a radical break with earlier styles. The previous styles in north-west India are mentioned above, and the group of Jain temples of Khajuraho, forming part of the famous Khajuraho Group of Monuments are very largely in the same style as their Hindu companions, which were mostly built between 950 and 1050. They share many features with the Māru-Gurjara style: high plinths with many decorated bands on the walls, lavish figurative and decorative carving, balconies looking out on multiple sides, ceiling rosettes, and others, but at Khajuraho the great height of the shikharas is given more emphasis. There are similarities with the contemporary Hoysala architecture from much further south. In both of these styles architecture is treated sculpturally.The legacy of G.S.

Career  = Youth = Prior to college, DiBisceglie trained with US Olympic Development men's soccer team at IMG Academy under Jeff Tipping in Bradenton, FL during the summers of 2009-11. Tipping named DiBisceglie team captain in 2011. His selection to represent the Princeton Soccer Association at IMG was made through the USL's Super Y-League as part of the Jersey United soccer club. In the winter and spring of 2009–10 New York Red Bulls Academy's director Bob Montgomery had DiBisceglie train with the Red Bulls U16 squad under head coach Rob Elliott. During the high school soccer fall seasons, DiBisceglie was a four-year starter in the midfield and a two-year captain for the Gill St Bernard Knights in Gladstone, NJ. He completed his career as the Knight's 8th all-time scorer in the school's history with 101 points (20g/61a) and was All- State, All-Conference, All-Area, All-County, All-Prep and All-Non Public. In back-to-back seasons (2011 & 2012), DiBisceglie was the leader of all Somerset County high school soccer players in assists at any level, Public and Non- Public, male or female. On November 17, 2009, Gill St. Bernard's won their first state team boys championship of any kind in the school's history with a 3–0 victory over St. Rose HS of Belmar, NJ. As a freshman starter, DiBisceglie scored two points in the title match with assists on the game-winning goal and the final goal. = College = After being recruited by twenty-one college soccer programs, most notably, Holy Cross, Iona and Rutgers University, DiBisceglie chose to attend the University of Scranton, where he was a four- year starter as a defensive center midfielder for the Royals. Scoring eight goals in 73 appearances, while also recording 11 assists, he was named to the NSCAA's All-Landmark Conference First Team in 2015 and was All-Conference again in 2016. On November 7, 2015, the Scranton Royals came from behind to defeat the #6 nationally ranked Elizabethtown Blue Jays 3–2 for the school's first conference men's soccer championship in 30 years. DiBisceglie assisted on Scranton's initial goal that changed the game in the upset victory. One year later, almost exactly to the day, on November 5, 2016, the Royals once again travelled to Elizabethtown to meet in the Landmark Championship re- match. Like he did in 2015, DiBisceglie found his way onto the score sheet again in 2016 to give Scranton a – victory in the title rematch over the Blue Jays. To date, DiBisceglie is the only player in Landmark Conference history to register assists in back-to-back Men's Soccer Championship victories. The 2016 Landmark Championship sent the Royals to the NCAA Men's Soccer Tournament where on November 12, 2016, Scranton defeated Penn St Behrend, 2–1 to advance to the NCAA tournament's second round. On November 13, 2016, the Royals lost to 13th ranked SUNY Cortland 1–2 in the Round of 32. Despite playing in just the two tournament matches, DiBisceglie finished the NCAA competition ranked seventh in America amongst all players for most shots per game. = Semi- Professional= While in college, DiBisceglie doubled as a semi-professional central midfielder for the Electric City Shock SC in the National Premier Soccer League playing 21 matches during the Shock's 2015 and 2016 campaigns. On March 14, 2015, DiBisceglie signed a contract with Electric City and opened his account that same evening with a goal against the Trenton Rebels in his first match with the Shock. On May 22, 2016, DiBisceglie scored a goal and had two assists in the come-from-behind 4–3 overtime victory for Electric City over NPSL powerhouse, Junior Lonestar FC. In that match, his second assist at the 90th minute won the match for Electric City, while his 52nd-minute bending goal around the Lonestar keeper from 24 yards away was recognized as the Shock's 2016 Goal of the Year. At the conclusion of the 2016 season, DiBisceglie finished tied for second on the team in goals scored and second in assists. As a result, he was nominated by Electric City to represent the NPSL's Northeastern Conference at the Los Angeles NPSL combine in January 2017. The nomination was made even though DiBisceglie missed the last three games of the NPSL season due to his transfer from the Shock in July to play professionally for FK Vítkovice in the Czech Republic National Football League. = Professional = Europe DiBisceglie's first professional soccer experience occurred in Scotland as a trialist with Kilmarnock FC in the Scottish Premier League in 2011. Arranged by former Welsh footballer and Swansea player, Glan Letheren, the trial became a success when Killie manager, Alan Robertson looked to sign DiBisceglie to a multi-year contract. Unfortunately the American was not able to obtain the required UK work-visa before the start of a Scottish Premier League season. But during the pre- season trial, DiBisceglie did get to play centre back for Kilmarnock, subbing on in the 35th minute of a match at Everton F.C. in England on August 6, 2011. On August 11, 2011 DiBisceglie also anchored Killie's back four for the full 90 minutes in their 2–0 win over Grange. On August 15, 2011 he travelled with Kilmarnock for a match at Rangers F.C. before having to return to the US. On July 4, 2016, DiBisceglie was offered a two-year professional contract from FK Vítkovice of the Czech Republic's National Football League. The team owner's offer was communicated through Glan Letheren and was based on DiBisceglie's CV. The 22-year-old flew to Vitkovice for training the next day. On July 9, 2016, he started and played the full match at centre back in Vítkovice's 2–0 win at Sigma Olomouc. After difficult deliberations with Vitkovice manager (Roman West), DiBisceglie chose not to sign the Vitkovice contract in order to pursue other professional opportunities in the United States. Roman West had become the manager of Vitkovice on July 1, 2016, just four days before DiBisceglie arrived. West was sacked 64 days later by the Vitkovice owners on September 4, 2016. America On March 21, 2017, DiBisceglie signed a two-year professional soccer contract to play center back for the Philadelphia Atoms of the American Soccer League. DiBisceglie debuted on April 9, 2017 when he started and played the full ASL match vs Mass United FC. On June 10, 2017, DiBisceglie was awarded Veritas Man of the Match for his efforts v SGFC Maryland. On September 23, 2017, the Philadelphia Atoms set a team record with six goals in a single match in a 6–1 win over AFC Lancaster. The old team record was set when the Atoms defeated the Washington Diplomats 5–1 in the NASL on May 4, 1974. DiBisceglie's opened his professional account with the first professional goal of his career. This goal was also Philadelphia's record-breaking sixth goal in the 63rd minute of the match. Earlier in that same match, he also notched his first professional assist on the Atoms' opening goal in the 5th minute. On October 12, 2017, DiBisceglie was elevated to player/Assistant Coach for Philadelphia by the Atoms' General Manager, Ike Onyeador. On November 4, 2017, Philadelphia concluded their inaugural season in Boston where DiBisceglie set the team record with 1,440 minutes played for the Atoms. Team owner, Matt Driver, suspended operations of the Philadelphia Atoms in late 2018 due to financial difficulties. Driver subsequently folded the ASL in 2019, making DiBisceglie a free-agent.  Personal life  Tim was born in Denville, New Jersey to Bruce & Kathy DiBisceglie. His maternal grandfather, Joseph is of Irish descent, while his paternal grandfather, Domdi is Italian. The rest of his paternal ancestry is Austrian & Costa Rican (aka: \\"Austarican\\") and his remaining maternal ancestry is Swiss, German and French. DiBisceglie was raised in Mine Hill Township, New Jersey with his elder sister Elizabeth. His father, mother and sister are all former soccer players. Tim is also nephew of harness racing driver Carl LeCause and cousin to New York Giants Super Bowl XXI offensive lineman Brad Benson. Off the pitch, DiBisceglie coaches children with special needs and is a certified USSF referee. = Coaching = At the University of Scranton Tim majored in Early and Primary Childhood Education and minored in Coaching. In his off-season, DiBisceglie is a Special Education teacher and varsity soccer and basketball coach at Newmark High School in Scotch Plains, New Jersey. On March 6, 2018, DiBisceglie was named head coach of the Gill St Bernard's boys JV soccer team and assistant coach for the boys varsity team, reuniting him with NJSIAA Hall of Fame coach, Tony Bednarsky. On November 11, 2018, Gill St Bernard's defeated Rutgers Prep 7–0 for the New Jersey State Boys Soccer Championship with DiBisceglie on Bednarsky's staff as his assistant coach. DiBisceglie is the first athlete in history to win a NJSIAA state championship for Gill St Bernard's as a player (2009) and a coach (2018, 2019). In 2019, with DiBisceglie as Assistant Coach for Bednarsky, Gill St Bernard began their pre- season in Portugal (3W-1D-1L), and then went on to win five championships titles: NJSIAA States, NJSIAA Sectionals, Somerset County (first in school history), Prep-B, and the Skyland-Raritan regular season Division. The Knights finished the 2019 campaign ranked #5 in all of NJ boys HS soccer with a 20-3 record and the five titles. The Gill St Bernard coaching staff groomed their 2019 players to three All-State, five All-Section, and eight All-Conference honors.

Designed by Lever Architecture, it would have been the tallest timber building in North America, and was called the \\"nation's first high-rise building made of wood\\". This project was cancelled in 2018 due to funding. Description The Framework building was designed by architect Thomas Robinson. The timber material planned for the building was cross laminated timber (CLT) utilizing Pres-Lam rocking walls for lateral resistance. The architecture firm had planned to use CLT from D.R. Johnson Lumber Company from Riddle, Oregon. The building's number of stories had been given both as 12 and as 11. Construction is expected to begin in fall 2017. The mixed-use building would have provided office space on floors two through six, and affordable housing may have been placed on floors seven through eleven. History The project team won a $1.5 million grant from the USDA in September 2015 for participating in the Tall Wood Building Prize Competition. The design phase included extensive fire, structural and acoustic testing. Building assemblies tested during this phase met the requirements of the Oregon Building Codes Division. Framework was approved by the Portland Design Commission in September 2016, and the construction permit for the project was approved by the state's Building Codes Division on June 6, 2017.

Biography  Tanqueray was born in 1691 to David Willaume I, a prominent Huguenot silversmith, who had come to London from France in 1685. In 1717, she married David Tanqueray, her father's apprentice; they had two sons. Her husband established a workshop, and it is likely that Tanqueray created items bearing her husband's mark. Upon her husband's death, after 1724, she took over his business and she entered two marks (Sterling and New Standard) in the register at Goldsmiths' Hall. Her marks appeared alongside her husband's original 1713 mark, with his name being struck through and hers written above, as opposed to a new entry, which was custom for a widow. This appears to be the only instance in which this happened. As a female silversmith in the 18th century, Tanqueray would have had the opportunity to produce her own work and oversee skilled journeymen. Tanqueray's workshop was noted for its high level of excellence and in 1729 it became Subordinate Goldsmith to the King. Tanqueray died in 1733 and was buried in Tingrith on 25 July that year. Examples of Tanqueray's work can be found at Temple Newsam, Huguenot Museum in Rochester, Kent, Victoria and Albert Museum, the National Museum Wales, Welbeck Abbey, and the Clark Art Institute collections.

Wealth inequality in Latin America and the Caribbean refers to economic discrepancies among people of the region. Wealth inequality remains a serious issue despite strong economic growth and improved social indicators observed over the past decade. A report release in 2013 by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs entitled Inequality Matters. Report of the World Social Situation, observed that: ‘Declines in the wage share have been attributed to the impact of labour- saving technological change and to a general weakening of labour market regulations and institutions. Such declines are likely to affect individuals in the middle and bottom of the income distribution disproportionately, since they rely mostly on labour income.’ In addition, the report noted that ‘highly-unequal land distribution has created social and political tensions and is a source of economic inefficiency, as small landholders frequently lack access to credit and other resources to increase productivity, while big owners may not have had enough incentive to do so. According to the ECLAC, Latin America is the most unequal region in the world. Inequality is undermining the region's economic potential and the well-being of its population, since it increases poverty and reduces the impact of economic development on poverty reduction.Francisco H. Ferreira, David de Ferranti et al. An example of the policies introduced to combat the poverty and inequality was the import substitution industrialization economic policy. This policy sought to grow national industry and offer protection from foreign competition as a means to reduce external dependencies and improve local economies. \\"Inequality in Latin America:Breaking with History?\\", The World Bank, Washington, D.C., 2004 Children in Latin America are often forced to seek work on the streets when their families can no longer afford to support them, leading to a substantial population of street children in Latin America. According to some estimates, there are 40 million street children in Latin America. Inequality in Latin America has deep historical roots in the Latin European racially based Casta systemSee Passing (racial identity) for a discussion of a related phenomenon, although in a later and very different cultural and legal context. instituted in Latin America in colonial times that have been difficult to eradicate since the differences between initial endowments and opportunities among social groups have constrained the poorest's social mobility, thus making poverty to be transmitted from generation to generation, becoming a vicious cycle. High inequality is rooted in the deepest exclusionary institutions of the Casta system that have been perpetuated ever since colonial times and that have survived different political and economic regimes. Inequality has been reproduced and transmitted through generations because Latin American political systems allow a differentiated access on the influence that social groups have in the decision making process, and it responds in different ways to the least favored groups that have less political representation and capacity of pressure.Fracisco H. Ferreira et al. Inequality in Latin America: Breaking with History?, The World Bank, Washington, D.C., 2004 Recent economic liberalisation also plays a role as not everyone is equally capable of taking advantage of its benefits. Differences in opportunities and endowments tend to be based on race, ethnicity, rurality and gender. Because inequality in gender and location are near universal, race and ethnicity play a larger, more integral role in the unequal discriminatory practices in Latin America. These differences have a strong impact on the distribution of income, capital and political standing. In 2008, According to UNICEF, Latin America and the Caribbean region had the highest combined income inequality in the world with a measured net Gini coefficient of 48.3, an unweighted average which is considerably higher than the world's Gini coefficient average of 39.7. Gini is the statistical measurement used to measure income distribution across entire nations and their populations and their income inequality. The other regional averages were: sub-Saharan Africa (44.2), Asia (40.4), Middle East and North Africa (39.2), Eastern Europe and Central Asia (35.4), and high-income nations (30.9). There are quite many different approaches for measuring inequality. In one of the studies by Baten and Fraunholz (2004), the authors chose an anthropometric approach, namely height inequality in order to see if inequality itself is a threat to globalization and whether openness increases the inequality by using the coefficient of height variation. \\"This measure covers not only wage recipients (as some other inequality indices do), but also the self-employed, the unemployed, housewives, children, and other groups who may not be participating in a market economy. In addition, this variable has the advantage to be an outcome indicator, whereas real income is an input to human utility.\\" According to a study by the World Bank,the richest decile of the population of Latin America earnFrancisco H. Ferreira et al. Inequality in Latin America: Breaking with History?, The World Bank, Washington, D.C., 2004 48% of the total income, while the poorest 10% of the population earn only 1.6% of the income. In contrast, in developed countries, the top decile receives 29% of the total income, while the bottom decile earns 2.5%. The countries with the highest inequality in the region (as measured with the Gini index in the UN Development Report) in 2007 were Haiti (59.5), Colombia (58.5), Bolivia (58.2), Honduras (55.3), Brazil (55.0), and Panama (54.9), while the countries with the lowest inequality in the region were Venezuela (43.4), Uruguay (46.4) and Costa Rica (47.2). Trends on income inequality 1998–2010 in 7 Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela). Source of the data: World Bank. According to the World Bank, the poorest countries in the region were (as of 2008): Haiti, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Honduras. Undernourishment affects 47% of Haitians, 27% of Nicaraguans, 23% of Bolivians and 22% of Hondurans. Many countries in Latin America have responded to high levels of poverty by implementing new, or altering old, social assistance programs such as conditional cash transfers. These include Mexico's , Brazil's Bolsa Escola and Bolsa Familia, Panama's Red de and Chile's Chile Solidario.Barrientos, A. and Claudio Santibanez. (2009). \\"New Forms of Social Assistance and the Evolution of Social Protection in Latin America\\". Journal of Latin American Studies. Cambridge University Press 41, 1–26. In general, these programs provide money to poor families under the condition that those transfers are used as an investment on their children's human capital, such as regular school attendance and basic preventive health care. The purpose of these programs is to address the inter-generational transmission of poverty and to foster social inclusion by explicitly targeting the poor, focusing on children, delivering transfers to women, and changing social accountability relationships between beneficiaries, service providers and governments.Benedicte de la Brière and Laura B. Rawlings, \\"Examining Conditional Cash Transfer Programs: A Role for Increased Social Inclusion?\\", Social Safety Net Primary Papers, The World Bank, 2006, p.4 These programs have helped to increase school enrollment and attendance and they also have shown improvements in children's health conditions. Most of these transfer schemes are now benefiting around 110 million people in the region and are considered relatively cheap, costing around 0.5% of their GDP. In some countries e.g. in Peru decentralisation is hoped to help address social justice and poverty better. NGOs which addressed those problems on the local level before could help with that.

The garden depends administratively on the University of Valencia. It is a member of Botanical Gardens Conservation International (BGCI).Jardí Botànic de la Universitat de València, Botanical Gardens Conservation International] The University was growing herbs for medicinal purposes as early as the 16th century. A botanical garden was projected from the mid-18th century, and the Garden opened on its present site in 1802. It remains a centre for study, education and public use.  History  Greenhouse in la bassa (Pond) Pool Carles Pau Square, Botanic Garden of Valencia Greenhouse and ferns, Botanical Garden of Valencia Medicinal plants section in the Botanical Garden of Valencia =Origins= There are documented records of plots for growing medicinal plants since the 16th century, closely related to medical education in the university, practised since 1462. The earliest reference dates from 1499, when a professorship in “simples\\" or \\"herbs” was being planned, and teachers were appointed to it in 1501. The plant collection had always been related to medicine, cultivating herbs for medicinal use. In 1548 a chair of medical practice was created, and a short time later (1560) teaching of “simples\\" or herbs was separated from that of anatomy, with independent departments. In 1567 the Jurats (municipal government) of the City of Valencia appointed Joan Plaça as doctor of medicine with the task of botanizing - collecting species - and gave him “a garden where those plants needed for teaching will be planted”. Later, in 1631, there were several reports concerning these gardens, their location, and the doctors and professors in charge, but there does not appear to have been any assurance that the gardens would continue in being. In 1733 the University considered the possibility of an enclosure to be provided by the city, but not until 1757 did rector Lores directly propose a comprehensive botanical garden, complete with orchard, museum, teaching and conference space, and ancillary services, in a location near the Albereda avenue. In 1778 the city endorsed this proposal, but it would be another twenty years before it was realised. It is clear that this broader and more systematic concept of a botanical garden derived from the 18th-century development of the study of Botany as a science separate from Medicine. This development was inspired by Enlightenment thought, with a new interest in natural resources and agricultural improvements. In 1767 Gregori Maians called for the creation of a garden, to be run by the University's department of botany, to include the cultivation of plants of interest to medicine. In 1786, the University agreed to change the curriculum, separating the Professorship of Botany from the Professorship of Medicine, which made a Botanical Garden more of a necessity. The Valencian Economic Society (Reial Societat Econòmica d’Amics del País de València),An institution established in the context of European enlightened reformism. It was a study and debate club focussed on national affairs and economic development on the basis of Enlightenment ideas. interested in crop improvements, was also seeking at this time to work with the city government to provide land for such a scientific facility, together with a public promenade (Albereda). The society envisaged that the scheme would have scientific, instructional and recreational value. =Establishment= But this combination would not be so easy, because each party sought to emphasize its own priorities. The University's scientific and teaching interest looked for a systematic botanical collection representing the botanical sphere, while the Society aimed to maximise its utility for agriculture. The city finally yielded the promised ground to the University in 1798, but planting was soon suspended, apparently due to the poor quality of the soil and the inconveniences caused to the adjacent promenade of the Albereda. In 1802 the city offered a new and definitive site, which could be irrigated in the traditional way, by border irrigation, directly from the Rovella irrigation channel. It was called the Tramoieres and it was located in calle Quart, in front of the San Sebastian Minima convent and close to the Túria. This marked the origin of the present Botanical Garden. The University placed the famous botanist Vicente Alfonso Lorente in charge of the new facility and provided him with the means to develop it. The trapezoidal site of about four hectares accommodated planting plots on a checkerboard system, known as the Linnaeus system, and also provided for herbaria, premises for the professor of Botany, buildings for the gardeners and other outbuildings. The successful completion of the garden quickly brought it renown among leading botanists, and relations were established particularly with the botanical garden in Madrid. This promising start would soon suffer the blow of the Napoleonic invasion, which was especially destructive in the Quart suburb. Lorente was also affected by these events: he was imprisoned and sentenced to death, and was saved only by the intervention of the French botanist Léon Dufour. =19th-century development= After the war and the death of Lorente in 1813, the garden did not recover until the long term of leadership of Professor of Medicine Josep Pizcueta between 1829 and 1867. He undertook reforms and established it as the leading botanical garden in Spain. In response to a request by the Economic Society, experiments were carried out on acclimatization of plants native to America. At the same time, the chair of Agriculture was set up, directed by Joaquín Carrascosa. Also, in a process of convergence sanctioned by the Royal Order of 1834, teaching in agriculture and botany were brought together at the Botanical Garden, leading to an enlargement of the garden. In 1843, Pizcueta, assisted by Félix Robillard, replaced the Linnaeus organization by the natural method of Endlicher. After a reform of the study programme in 1845, he received substantial resources for plantations and also for acclimatization installations, such as a large wooden greenhouse designed by the architect Timoteu Calvo, a conservatory and small heated spaces that, together, would accelerate dramatically the success and growth of the specimens. In 1856, the catalogue of the garden was published, with over 6,000 living species and the herbarium. This phase of development bore lasting fruit in the construction of the iron and glass conservatory between 1860 and 1862. It was designed in 1859 by the well-known architect Sebastià Monleón. It is considered a building ahead of its time in regard of the materials used in its construction. The project was challenging in technological, financial and practical terms. It measures 24m long, 8.25m inner diameter and 9m high, and its glazed surface measures 465m2. This south- facing glass cover has the shape of a quarter-circle, from the ground to a vertical wall, forming an attached space. Its size enables it to house such large plants as Astarapea, Aralia racemose (Araliaceae), Chorisia spaciosa (Malvacae) or Ficus benjamina (Moraceae), which may measure more than 5m high and cannot be accommodated in most other greenhouses. In making the case for funding this project, the University argued for the scientific necessity to provide the conditions needed to maintain the hundreds of exotic plants already brought to the garden, and also for maintaining its status among the leading gardens of Europe, keeping abreast of scientific progress. A building topped with a turret was later attached to the greenhouse wall. Built to house management and research departments, this building still exists, although other features of interest such as wooden buildings, the original shade gardens and a greenhouse, have disappeared over the years. Nevertheless, the greenhouse has been reconstructed according to the 1867 plans of architect Idelfons Fernández Calvache, of which we have written records. These structures were probably replaced by the present iron ones during the last quarter of the 19th century. Near the end of the 19th century, small greenhouses were built next to the seed nursery under the leadership of Arévalo Baca. In 1888, work was completed on the biggest greenhouse, which is known as “the raft” because of the proximity of the two elements. It was built according to the 1861 design. In 1900, the present shade garden was opened. Planned in 1897 by the versatile Madrid architect Mélida Alinar in 1897, it was constructed of iron on a base of brick, and was inspired by the glass canopies of railway stations of the time. This marked the completion of building works on the site, and provided it with one of its most attractive features. The botanical garden now became part of the science faculty, and the School of Botanical Studies increased its involvement with the site. The practical and experimental role of the plantations was enhanced in the context of the agricultural boom of that period, under the leadership of Rafael Cisternes (1867-1876) and Josep Arévalo Baca (1876-1888). In 1878 the northern extension was opened, creating the present-day layout of the enclosure, whose juxtaposition with the streets Beat Gaspar Bono and Quart has remained unchanged since then. Between 1879 and 1880 the campus of the Sant Josep college or dels Pares Jesuïtes was established. =20th and 21st centuries= The garden was restored after the flood of 1957 thanks to the tenacity of the director Ignacio Docavo. Several damaged buildings were restored between 1962 and 1968, aiming to incorporate other elements of scientific interest. Later, with professor Manuel Costa as director, a comprehensive rehabilitation was undertaken. This project included the garden - restructuring the plantations, alternative irrigation techniques, and care of the plots - and the most characteristic architectural elements - the outer fence, the greenhouses and heated spaces, the shade garden, and the pavilion. The research building was constructed in 2000 on the site of expropriated buildings facing calle Quart. Currently, in addition to the preservation of the historic garden, it continues to function as a centre for botanical study, research, development and dissemination. It undertakes research on flora, biosystems and vegetation. It participates in international projects related to vegetational biodiversity and study of native plants. It has a library, a herbarium and a repository of germplasm. It promotes conferences of specialists, day classes, meetings and expositions. Today, the Botanical Garden of the University provides a centre for scientific and teaching activities, a vegetated, architectural and historical space, and a feature of the urban landscape.

It publishes a quarterly journal and holds annual meetings in conjunction with the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. Purpose The AAPP is a learned society of psychiatrists and philosophers who share an interest in the interface of philosophy and psychiatry. It was formed to facilitate the integration of those two fields by promoting cross-disciplinary research, educational initiatives, and graduate training programs. The organization believes that philosophical methods applied to psychiatry bring types of analysis and critique that are valuable for their clarity of thought, meaning, and application to clinical practice. It also believes that psychiatry informs philosophy, and that \\"philosophy and psychiatry\\" is developing into an interdisciplinary field of its own. AAPP aims to enhance the psychiatrist's effectiveness as teacher, researcher, and practitioner by shedding light on the philosophical issues embedded in these activities. It also aims to study the ways in which psychiatric knowledge, theories, and practices can add to basic philosophical assumptions about subjects like mind, knowledge, and subjectivity. Specific interest areas of AAPP include the identification and understanding of abnormal experience and behavior; the problem of classifying psychiatric conditions; the relationship between neuroscience and clinical practice; the evaluation of clinical methods; and moral and ethical issues raised by psychiatric categories and practice. Publications The organization's official journal is Philosophy, Psychiatry, & Psychology, published quarterly by Johns Hopkins University Press. The AAPP Bulletin is an informal publication released on an irregular schedule, typically one or two times a year. AAPP, in collaboration with two related organizations, sponsors Psagacity, a privately owned website featuring professionally produced oral history videos of prominent members. Meetings AAPP holds it annual meeting as an Affiliated Group on the opening weekend of the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. Related organizations AAPP is closely associated with other organizations in the field, including the UK-based International Network for Philosophy & Psychiatry and the Philosophy Interest Group of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. The Department of Psychiatry at the University of Montreal and the Centre Hospitalier de l’Université de Montreal are sponsoring institutions of AAPP and its journal.

Early life \\"I was five, I didn't have any idea what lungs are\\" Lorenza originally wanted to play the trumpet as she had just seen the elephant trumpeters in the Walt Disney movie \\"Robin Hood\\". The music school didn't approve of her wanting to play the trumpet as she was too young and her lungs were not big enough. They started her off on the violin instead. Education \\"I met Lorenza Borrani when she was 9 years old at the Music School of Fiesole. [...] She was a sweet and enthusiastic child, together with her mother we went to see the concert Itzhak Perlman held at the Teatro della Pergola in Florence, it was the early 90s. Great Perlman and great Lorenza, who over the years has been able to conquer the public and critics with her wonderful qualities of interpreter.\\" Loreanza Borrani thinks it is very important to mention the education of a musician and she feels very faithful to the teachers of her youth. It was a Dutch lady, a neighbor, who noticed her curiosity about music. She began taking violin lessons, around age five, at the Scuola di Musica di Fiesole, studying with Alina Company; Piero Farulli, Zinaida Gilels and Pavel Vernikov. In her concert debut in 1995 at the theatre \\"La Pergola\\" in Florence, she performed Bach’s Concerto for 2 Violins with Pavel Vernikov and the direction of Emmanuel Krivine , in the presence of the at that time Italian Republic President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. She undertook postgraduate studies at the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz, Austria, with Boris Kuschnir and participated in masterclasses with Pier Narciso Masi, Mstislav Rostropovich, Ana Chumachenko, Maya Glezarova and Ilya Grubert. Often, in her interviews, Lorenza Borrani recalled the importance that some conductors, with whom she worked, have had in her musical growth. Among them, especially Lorin Maazel, Claudio Abbado and Nikolaus Harnoncourt. Career \\"Maybe the moment I like most about my role as a musician is rehearsal. The moment in which something is built, more than the moment in which the product is presented. The moment of the 'work in progress' is really very special for me.\\" Since 2008 Lorenza Borrani has been Leader (concertmaster) of the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, with which she performed, among others, under the direction of Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Bernard Haitink, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, Antonio Pappano, Andras Schiff and Simon Rattle. In 2003 she became leader of Symphonica Toscanini, directed by Lorin Maazel. She was a member of Orchestra Mozart from 2005 to 2008, with whom she performed Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 7 under Claudio Abbado in 2006. A nice episode of her experience with the Orchestra Mozart was the waltz danced with Roberto Benigni during the performance of Peter and the Wolf conducted by Claudio Abbado, in Bologna (2008). She also played in the Lucerne Symphony Orchestra under Claudio Abbado and in 2018 and 2019 she played again as leader of the Orchestra Mozart directed by Bernard Haitink. She has performed as a guest-leader or directed ensembles such as the European Union Youth Orchestra, Mahler Chamber Orchestra, Filarmonica della Scala, Bayerischen Rundfunk Orchester, Freiburger Barockorchester, Det Norske Kammerorkester (Artist-in-Residence, 2020) , Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, Ostrobothnian Chamber Orchestra, Vallès Symphony Orchestra, Orquesta Sinfónica de Tenerife and Australian Chamber Orchestra . With the Australian Chamber Orchestra she premiered her own orchestral arrangement of Prokofiev’s Violin Sonata No.1, on tour across Australia in spring 2019. As chamber musician, Lorenza Borrani has collaborated with Isabelle Faust, Daniel Hope, András Schiff, Pierre-Laurent Aimard, Janine Jansen, Irina Fiodorovna Schnittke, Christian Tetzlaff, Alexander Lonquich , Mario Brunello and others. As concertmaster of the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, Lorenza Borrani appears in the season 2020-2021 of the Philharmonie Berlin in a concert with the pianist Yuja Wang. She is a member of the Honorary Committee of the project \\"Farulli 100\\" dedicated in 2020 to the memory of Piero Farulli (viola of the legendary Quartetto Italiano and founder of the Scuola di Musica di Fiesole) on the centenary of his birth.

Thanks to this project and to the meeting with italian clarinetist Lorenzo Coppola, Lorenza Borrani developed curiosity and passion for the execution of the classical repertoire on period instruments. Spira Mirabilis was appointed Cultural Ambassadors for the European Union in March 2012, is still a living project today and has enjoyed great success all over in Europe , with appearances including Musikfest Bremen, London’s Southbank Centre, Essen’s Philharmonie, and Paris’ Cité de la Musique and Salle Pleyel. In 2018 Lorenza Borrani debuted at Schloss Elmau the ‘Mozart Quintets’ project, a collaboration with her close chamber music partners dedicated to the study and period performance of Mozart’s rarely performed string quintets . In 2019 the quintet played the complete Mozart's string and wind quintets for the Amici della Musica (Friends of Music) of Florence at the theatre \\"La Pergola\\".

He served as secretary to William III and to George I of Great Britain. Life Robethon was born at Authon-du-Perche, north-west France, into a Calvinist family. He is said to have joined the service of King William III when Prince of Orange only. He came to England about 1689, and was naturalised in 1693, being employed by William III, at first in a humble capacity. In 1693 he acted as secretary to Baron Schütz, the Hanoverian envoy in London. Afterwards he passed into the service of the Earl of Portland who, when ambassador to Paris in 1698, took Robethon with him. In September 1698, Robethon became private secretary to William III. Among William's correspondents, Robethon made an important contact in George William, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, who visited England in 1701. On William's death in 1702, Robethon transferred his services to the Duke, who died in 1705. Robethon then was employed by his son-in-law, George Lewis, the future George I of England. Robethon held the threads of an extended European correspondence. The leading Whigs in England kept themselves in touch with the House of Brunswick, and the letters from the Elector's family to their supporters in England were drafted by Robethon. The Duke of Marlborough paid him well for information on the intrigues of Louis XIV at the court of Saxony. Robethon also worked to assist Marlborough in neutralising Charles XII of Sweden, and undermining overtures Louis made to the allies in 1707. He was well informed about the Old Pretender. Worldly, adept and well briefed on English politicians, Robethon had influence with George I, though not with the ladies of the court. In 1714 Robethon accompanied George I to England, as secretary and counsellor, but was not easily accepted. Sunderland used him and Bothmer in 1716 to split the king from Robert Walpole, who disliked Robethon. Before the return of Walpole to power, Robethon's influence waned. Robethon made the first French translation of Alexander Pope's An Essay on Criticism (in verse), which was published in Amsterdam and London in 1717. In 1721 he was appointed governor of the French La Providence Hospital in east London.Murdoch, Tessa, and Randolph Vigne with foreword by Jacob Pleydell- Bouverie, 8th Earl of Radnor, The French Hospital in England: Its Huguenot History and Collections Cambridge: John Adamson , p. 101. He died in London on 14 April 1722. Legacy Some of Robethon's correspondence was in 11 volumes of Hanoverian letters with the Stowe MSS., now in the British Library. The collection was formed around the Electress Sophia's papers, which were entrusted to Robethon by George I on his mother's death in 1714. They were later sold by the executors of the secretary's son, Colonel Robethon, in 1752, to Matthew Duane, and while in his hands were seen by James Macpherson. They were subsequently purchased by Thomas Astle, and in 1803 by the Marquess of Buckingham. Family Robethon married Claudine Maxwell, nicknamed \\"Madame Grenouille\\", in 1703; she survived him. They had a son, George William Frederick. The couple seem to have had pensions from both George I and his son.

It is inspired by his six-month stay in Camarillo State Hospital in Ventura County, California, after serving a prison term for arson and resisting arrest. The tune is a blues in C major and has become a jazz standard. Background \\"Relaxin' at Camarillo\\" was inspired by Parker's term for a half a year, recovering in Camarillo State Hospital in Ventura County, California. He had been sent there to recuperate from drink and drug addiction after a term spent in jail from setting fire to his bed sheets, running naked through the hotel lobby and resisting arrest, incapacitated. Camarillo was a mental hospital set in several Mission Revival buildings to the north of Los Angeles. Recordings After release, Bird was able to record it along with three originals by trumpeter Howard McGhee: \\"Cheers\\", \\"Stupendous\\" and \\"Carvin the Bird\\". Parker recorded the tune with McGhee on trumpet, Dodo Marmarosa on piano, Wardell Gray on tenor, Barney Kessell on guitar, Red Callender on bass and Don Lamond on drums. The tune was originally recorded in C major, and has become a jazz standard. Ted Gioia, commenting in West Coast Jazz: Modern Jazz in California, 1945-1960, has referred to the original recording as a \\"sinuous blues\\", a 12-bar blues that is a \\"further testimony to the subtlety of Parker's rhythmic phrasing\\". Gioia considers it to have been one of the finest recordings Parker made in California. Roy Porter and David Keller consider \\"Relaxin' at Camarillo\\" to be a \\"great bop classic\\". Guitarist Joe Pass recorded it in 1964 for his album Joy Spring. Saxophonist Joe Henderson released an album of the same name, featuring the recording, in 1979. It was later recorded by pianist Cedar Walton. Jazz Journal International stated in 2009 that Walton \\"provides a stimulating introduction to Parker's Relaxin' At Camarillo. Cedar's solo here is one of his best on a disc that is chock full of glowing solos.\\" References Charlie Parker Compositions by Charlie Parker 1946 songs 1940s jazz standards Jazz compositions in C major ","title":"Relaxin' at Camarillo"},{"id":"53483162","text":"Mengxia () may refer to: *Wanhua District, a district in Taipei, Taiwan, originally called Mengxia (alternatively spelled Monga, Mengjia, Mongka, etc.) *Monga (film), a period film set and filmed in Wanhua District Item named after Mengxia *Bangka Park, a park in Wanhua District See also *Monga (disambiguation) *Mengjia (disambiguation) ","title":"Mengxia"},{"id":"53483182","text":"James W.

In December 2015, the brewery opened a second facility in Canton, Massachusetts. In October 2018, Trillium opened a new 3-story restaurant and brewery in Fort Point.  Awards  For the year 2016, RateBeer listed Trillium as the third-best brewery in the world, and the best brewery in Massachusetts. RateBeer also included six Trillium beers in their top 15 beers in the India Pale Ale (IPA) category, one beer in the Double IPA category, six beers in the American Amber/Pale category and one beer in the Wheat category.  Controversies  In 2014 Trillium failed to renew their state brewers license, resulting in a nearly month-long closure. Trillium claimed to have submitted an application for renewal in 2013, however no license was issued and the state sent numerous notices to the company without response. Trillium continued to operate illegally for the majority of 2014 and was closed by the state at the end of November 2014. In late 2018, a number of former Trillium employees posted messaged on BeerAdvocate.com accusing the ownership of cutting wages, serving sub par product to customers, paying retail staff server wages and illegally using tequila in a beer and instructing staff to lie about it. Trillium owner JC Tetreault spoke to the Boston Globe admitting to making \\"a mistake\\" and did not deny any of the claims, confirming many of them. On November 26, 2018, the owners of Trillium posted a statement on their website saying retail employees will have their hourly wages restored for longtime workers whose pay had been cut. They company also apologized to employees, customers, and friends. The Boston Globe reported the company's retail workforce will be paid $15 to $18 an hour, and still have the ability to earn tips from customers purchasing beer. In July of 2020 cans of Trillium's fruited Berliner Weiss, Daily Serving, began to explode at consumer's homes due to refermentation taking place in the cans. Trillium released a statement about the exploding cans which was perceived by many as blaming the customers for poorly storing the cans and taking no responsibility for the fact that they sold a product that could explode. https://www.pastemagazine.com/drink/craft-beer/exploding-beer-cans- trillium-450-north-fruit/  References   External links  * Beer brewing companies based in Massachusetts ","title":"Trillium Brewing Company"},{"id":"53483456","text":"Justin de Vos (born 12 November 1998) is a Dutch football player of Curaçao descent who plays for EVV Eindhoven.

Early life and education Julio Fonseca was born in San José, Costa Rica on May 22, 1885. His primary and secondary education was obtained at the Seminary School in San Jose. He studied for his bachelors at the Lyceum of Costa Rica.Flores, B. (1973). Julio Fonseca. San José: Ministerio de Cultura, Juventud y Deporte. He began to study music from an early age at the National School of Music, and later at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia. He created his first compositions in 1897 - 1902 while under the tutelage of important musicians such as José Joaquín Vargas Calvo and Alvise Castegnaro. These compositions include ¡Licha ... ! (1897), Noche de luna (1897), Brisas del campo (1898), En la matiné (1898), Esperanza (1898); also works for the solo piano: Celia (1898), Fuegos Fatuos (1901), Escenas del festín (1901), Miniatura (1901), Estudio (1901), Nocturno (1901), Paisaje (1902); Ave María (1898) and Oh Salutaris, composed in 1902.  Time in Europe (1902–1906)  =Milan, Italy= In 1902, he received a scholarship from the government of President Ascensión Esquivel Ibarra to study in Europe. He was accepted to both the Royal Bavarian Music School and the Milan Conservatory. After careful consideration, he decided to study in piano and harmony in Milan. He arrived to discover that he was one year short of the conservatory's age requirement and had to study for a year at an art school. The school terminated Fonseca's studies prompting him to write a letter to the Costa Rican government requesting permission to transfer to another conservatory while maintaining his government provided scholarship. =Brussels, Belgium= Fonseca's application was accepted at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels prompting a move to that city in 1904. His academic stay was extended into 1906, when he was diagnosed with a serious pulmonary disease that motivated him to return to Costa Rica. During his time Europe, he wrote the songs Amor ti chiedo (1904) and the work, Nocturnetto, written in Milan. In Brussels, he wrote The Sonata en Si for piano and piano; the trio for violin, cello and piano El Cenáculo, the quartet for strings and piano, el Gólgota, and Romanza, a song with French lyrics. First return to Costa Rica (1907–1913) From 1907 to 1913, he remained in Costa Rica teaching music direction and instruments. During this period, he met María Elena Mora whom he married in 1912. Together, they had three sons and two daughters: Jimmy (1916), Harold (1920), Mercy, Molly y Julio (1924). Among his most important compositions at this time were the waltzes: El Enigma (1912) and Florita (1912); and the promenades Claudia (1912) and Brisas del Caribe (1912); the funeral march Ecce homo (1911) and the march El centenario (1911). Time in the US (1914–1916) In 1914, Fonseca travelled with his wife to New York to improve his musical knowledge and economic situation. Their stay in lasted only one year as the economic and labor situation was very difficult given the turmoil of World War I. The situation was challenging enough that they had to receive assistance from the musician, Alejandro Monestel and the writer, Manuel González Zeledón. During this year (1914), Fonseco wrote important works like the religious songs, Dios te Salve numbers 1 and 2; the tangos, El elegante, El gaucho, Midinettes, No aflojés, che; the funeral march, Inri; the orchestral works, Maxixe and Obertura húngara, and his famous waltz, Leda. Second return to Costa Rica (1916–1950) =Teaching= After his return to Costa Rica in 1916, Fonseca dedicated his efforts to teaching, participating in important academic projects such as the founding of the Conservatorio de Música y Declamación.Vargas, M. C. (2004). De las fanfarrias a las salas de concierto. San José: EUCR. He was also part of the faculty of the Escuela de Música Santa Cecilia,Flores, B. (1978). La Música en Costa Rica. San José: Editorial Costa Rica where he occasionally assumed the duties of the Director of the Institution (J. J. Vargas Calvo) during the director's absences. In 1934, Fonsca founded the la Academia Euterpe with his son Jimmy and violinist Raúl Cabezas. The academy was only in operation for a few years. It primarily focused on teaching violin and piano, but also had a chior and an orchestra.Zúñiga, V. (1992). Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional. San José: EUNED Fonseca was an instructor at the Colegio de Señoritas where he was a professor of music from 1927 to 1942. Finally, Fonseca was a founding professor at the Conservatorio Nacional de Música, in 1942. This institution later transformed into the School of Music Arts of the University of Costa Rica. =Organist and choir director= Julio Fonseca Gutiérrez had a deep and profound bond between his artistic life and his religious beliefs. This is evident in his relationship with Catholic institutions, and his work as the Choir Director of the Iglesia de la Merced from 1932 until the last years of his life. Fonseca's youngest son, Julio Jr., dedicated himself to the priesthood inspiring Fonseca to compose the Mass, Vitis et Palmites, in December 1948 in honor of his son's ordination. Fonseca's unedit works contain many compositions exalting the pillars of the Christian religion with 35 songs and hymns dedicated to the Virgin Mary. His works inspired by Christianity also include important compositions like the choral cantatas Los Siete Dolores de la Virgen (1920) and el Auto Místico de la Virgen de los Ángeles (1938). He also wrote five masses: la Misa Teologal en Sol Mayor (1928), la misa Corazón de María (1929), Ave María Stella (1932), la misa Ujarrás (1934) and la misa Vitis et Palmites (1948). =Other work= In addition to his work as a teacher, composer and choir director, Fonseca was also known as the director of an orchestra and musical group that performed during dedications of social spaces and special events in Costa Rica during the first half of the 20th century. He was also recognized as an official instrumentalist of the Military Band of San Jose,Araya, J. R. (1957). Vida musical de Costa Rica. San José: Imprenta Nacional a musical institution for whom he composed and released some of his work. He was also a music critic and journalist, writing for the newspaper La Justicia Social in the early part of the 20th century, and later for the magazine El Maestro and for la Revista Musical with three articles published in 1940, 1941, 1944. In 1910, he wrote a booklet titles Lecciones de Armonía (Lessons in Harmony) for the Santa Cecilia school of music. =In search of national identity – trips to Guanacaste= Julio Fonseca was part of a group of musicians that responded in 1927, to a call from Education Secretary Luis Dobles Segreda of governor Jiménez de Oreamuno's administrationVargas, M. C. (2008). ¿Cómo tuvimos música nacional? La Nación, Áncora, p. 6 to search for a national identify in the field of music. In 1929, the government decided to send three musicians, Roberto Cantillano, José Daniel Zúñiga and Julio Fonseca, to Guanacaste where they would compile, harmonize, and edit a compilation of folklore, El Folleto de Música Folclórica Nacional. Three editions of the work were published in 1929, 1934, and 1935. Last years The last years of Julio Fonseca were full of emotional contrasts. The death of his wife Maria Elena in 1948 caused health problems for him. His son Julio Jr was ordained and priest. He wrote more important works such as the mass, Vitis et Palmites and the waltz, María Elena. In the months before his death, he visited his sons, Jimmy and Harold. During this trip, a tribute concert was arranged by the Pan American Union that included an opportunity for him to conduct the orchestra. Julio Fonseca died in San José on June 22, 1950.

His career was tarnished due to his association with organized crime. Early life and career Bevilacqua grew up in Silver Lake, an Italian-American neighborhood of Providence. He attended Providence public schools and received a Bachelor of Arts from Providence College in 1940.Joseph M. Muratore, Italian-Americans in Rhode Island, Volume 2 (1999), p. 92.Manual with Rules and Orders for the Use of the General Assembly of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (1975), p. 237. He served in the Army from 1941 to 1946, achieving the rank of First Lieutenant and serving in the Italian Campaign (World War II) where he was wounded and received a Purple Heart. He received a Juris Doctor degree from Georgetown Law School in 1948, and his clients and friends included organized crime figures. Political career Bevilacqua was elected to the Rhode Island House in 1954; he became majority leader in 1966 and Speaker in 1969. He worked for the passage of the state's medicare statute and for job retraining measures. He was elected by the General Assembly as Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court in 1976, and he promised to put aside \\"old friendships and causes.\\" Privately, however, he reassured mobster Nicholas Bianco: \\"Don't worry, I'll still keep my connections.\\" Around this time, a number of allegations surfaced regarding Bevilacqua's ties to organized crime. The New York Times stated that allegations had been made in 1976 that he had harbored a fugitive from a 1963 department store robbery, and had accepted a payment of $2,000 from him. It also became public that he had written a letter to the State Parole Board in 1973 vouching for the integrity of crime boss Raymond L. S. Patriarca. The letter read, \\"To whom it may concern: I have known Mr. Patriarca for a good many years. I have found him to be a good person of integrity and, in my opinion, good moral character.\\" Bevilacqua officiated at the wedding of Patriarca's chauffeur, who was under indictment for fraud. The State Commission on Judicial Tenure and Discipline investigated these incidents and took no action. Impeachment and resignation The Providence Journal brought public attention to Bevilacqua's ties to organized crime figures in 1984. State police officers followed him as he visited the homes of crime figures, and he was also observed frequenting a mob-connected motel for mid-day trysts with women. The Journal ran a front-page photo of him zipping his pants fly while leaving the Alpine Motel in Smithfield, Rhode Island. A judicial commission headed by former Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg censured Bevilacqua for associating with criminals. The General Assembly began impeachment proceedings in 1986, the first such proceedings in the state's history, but Bevilacqua resigned during the proceedings. Death Bevilacqua was hospitalized several times in his last few months, including for a heart attack in early May 1989. He was taken to Brigham and Women's Hospital on May 30, 1989 and died there on June 21. He is buried in Saint Ann Cemetery in Cranston, Rhode Island.

A self- taught cook, she helms the kitchen of Hiša Franko restaurant in Kobarid, Slovenia. Born to distinctly ambitious parents, she trained alpine skiing as a child, earning a place in the Yugoslavian youth national team, but later decided she didn't want a professional career. After that, she studied diplomacy in Gorizia, when she met her partner Valter Kramar. Kramar's parents owned Hiša Franko, an already established restaurant. Incidentally, they decided to retire just as she completed her study, so she and Kramar decided to stay and take over the family restaurant (against the wish of her parents). At first, she worked as a waitress (Kramar became a sommelier) and tried convincing the then chef to try experimenting with traditional recipes, to no avail. After he left, she took over the kitchen. With the help of her mother- in-law and a family friend, she shortly learned cooking well enough to attract attention in the wider region with her culinary creations. In 2010, she was featured in the Italian culinary magazine Identità Golose, which brought her even more attention. She began receiving invitations to top-notch culinary events, such as being a guest chef of the Ikarus restaurant in Hangar-7 in Salzburg, Austria, and the Gelinaz Grand Shuffle in New York City. In 2016, Roš was featured in the Netflix documentary Chef's Table and in early 2017, she was named world's best female chef by The World's 50 Best Restaurants academy. Her cooking style features innovative remaking of traditional recipes from the upper Soča valley region, prepared with local ingredients.  Recognition  In 2016, Roš was featured in the Netflix documentary Chef's Table. In 2017, she was named world's best female chef by The World's 50 Best Restaurants academy.

Most of the estimated 3,100 prostitutes in the Gambia are from Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea . Prostitution takes place on the beach, in bars and hotels on the coast. Away from the coast, prostitution mainly takes place in bars. The bars are frequently raided and the foreign prostitutes deported. They often return within a few days. The HIV infection rate for prostitutes is high. Sex tourism Gambia is a popular destination for sex tourism. One of the most popular areas is the \\"Senegambia strip\\", the coastal area around Kololi, and is often arranged through local \\"bumsters\\". Sex tourism in the Gambia attract western female tourists eager for sex with younger men. The Gambian Tourist Board plans to change the face of tourism in the country and encourage tourism for wildlife and heritage rather than sex. Child prostitution Child prostitution is a problem in the Gambia. The Gambian government is taking an active stance against it. Many young people turn to the sex trade due to poverty. The Gambia ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child on 3 August 1990, and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child in September 2000, which mandates the government to protect children from sexual child abuse. The main legislation is the Tourism Offences Act, 2003, which is describes a child as anyone under eighteen, even though the legal age of consent is sixteen years. The Tourism Act means that anyone employed in the tourism industry is committing a crime if s/he offers sexual favours to customers for money. The punishment is a fine, imprisonment of a maximum of two years and disqualification from tourism related work for ten years. The law states that hotel operators can face a fine and five years in prison if they knowingly allow child prostitution on their property. Child prostitution is particularly prevalent around the Tourist Development Area, as well as in Kololi, Senegambia and Pipeline. Some girls are sent to be prostitutes by their parents to support their families. Within The Gambia, girls and, to a lesser extent, boys are subjected to sex trafficking. Children from West African countries, mainly Senegal, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Benin, are recruited for commercial sexual exploitation in The Gambia. The majority of these victims are subjected to sexual exploitation by child sex tourists, primarily from Britain, Germany, Scandinavia, the Netherlands and Canada. In recent years, sex traffickers are increasingly hosting child sex tourists in private residences outside the commercial tourist areas of the capital, Banjul, making the crime harder for law enforcement to detect. Traffickers have allegedly exploited Sierra Leonean boys and girls as “cultural dancers” in The Gambia. Observers believe organised sex trafficking networks use European and Gambian travel agencies to promote child sex tourism. Sex trafficking The Gambia is a Tier 2 Watch List country for Human trafficking according to the US Department of State. The Gambian 2007 Trafficking Act prohibits trafficking and those convicted can be sentenced to prison for up to 50 years. The Gambia is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Within The Gambia, women, girls, and—to a lesser extent—boys are subjected to sex trafficking. Women and children from West African countries—mainly Senegal, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Benin—are recruited for commercial sexual exploitation in The Gambia.

It was released on 14 April 2017 on Ninja Tune Records. Upon its announcement, the video for the lead single \\"X22RME\\" was released on Ninja Tune's YouTube channel. AZD is Actress's fifth album. The preceding album, Ghettoville, had been suspected to have been his last. As an artist, Actress has always been considered vague in regards to the intentions behind his actions and albums. Christian Eede of The Quietus writes that while a common theme of Cunningham's albums reportedly experienced by listeners is death and a downbeat vibe, AZD shows Actress in a more humorous and open light. Cunningham tends to give vague titles to his music works to give his audience a glimpse of what the concept of the pieces are instead of fully revealing his thoughts on his songs. The album has a central concept of the sound associated with 'chrome'. Chrome can represent futuristic ideals while also conveying coldness which in turn could represent human dissociation. Even with this, AZD is a big change in terms of energy from past albums. Its energy is described and felt as higher, as it is not as gloomy or dark as his others.
