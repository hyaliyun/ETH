History Coins of the New Zealand dollar were introduced on 10 July 1967 to replace the pre-decimal New Zealand pound, which was pegged to the British pound. The dollar was pegged at two to a pound, thus 200 cents to the pound. The new two-cent coin replaced the old threepence coin. The original obverse was Arnold Machin's portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, and was used until 1985. In 1986 the portrait was changed to the version by Raphael Maklouf, introduced to the coins of the pound sterling in 1985. In 1988, the bronze one and two-cent coins had become too expensive to produce as inflation lowered the value of the dollar and their minting ceased. They remained legal tender until 30 April 1990.

This led the creation of Institute of Physics at the University of Engineering and Technology. However, the professional body of scientists was still needed, therefore, physicists from all over the country decided to established a formal body. In 1987, Ghulam Murtaza and dr. Abdul Hameed Nayyar organized the National Symposium on Frontiers in Physics, on the occasion of professor Salam's birthday. With Abdus Salam coming to visit to Pakistan, physicists from all over the country gathered at the Institute of Physics to attend the symposium, first of its kind, to gather and share the knowledge about latest developments in different areas of interest. With professor Salam spoke and stressed the importance of physics in the country, the multiple recommendations were sent by leading physicists to dr. Murtaza and dr.

He founded the Power Electronics Group at Caltech. Many of his former students are leaders in the field of power electronics today, including Slobodan ƒÜuk, Vatche Vorperian, Dragan Maksimovic, Robert Erickson, and V. Ramanarayanan.

David Middlebrook award for \\"outstanding contribution in the technical field of power electronics\\" in his honor.http://www.ieee- pels.org/awards/r-david-middlebrook-achievement-award Middlebrook was one of the founders of the IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference (APEC). Design-oriented analysis Dr. Middlebrook was a leading proponent of \\"Design-Oriented Analysis\\" (D-OA) of electrical circuits,https://web.archive.org/web/20160401041215/http://ardem.com/biography.asphttp://www.consult- cpr.com/Additional%20Pages/Eng%20LinksC.html which is a circuit analysis technique that seeks to develop circuit equations that are simple yet physically insightful. He developed many of the tools of D-OA including the Extra element theorem and the General Feedback Theorem.https://web.archive.org/web/20160401085637/http://ardem.com/ His goal with D-OA was to fundamentally change the way electrical engineering is taught in order to focus on practical design rather than circuit analysis. Middlebrook advocated keeping circuit analysis and equations as simple as possible, only adding additional complexity when experiments show it to be necessary. Many engineers who have studied D-OA after a traditional electrical engineering education have asked why circuit analysis is not taught in school using Middlebrook's methods.https://web.archive.org/web/20160401041428/http://ardem.com/D_OA_Rules%26Tools/index.asp A catchphrase familiar to Professor Middlebrooke's Caltech students is his dogged assertion of 'salient points' in the application of his D-OA methodology during instruction or in redline on graded (homework) assignments or tests. He wrote several books including An Introduction to Junction Transistor Theory, which helped early electrical engineers devise practical applications for the transistor.https://web.archive.org/web/20130511153957/http://powerelectronicsgroup.posterous.com/dr- middlebrook-remembered-in-caltechs-electri Awards and recognition Dr. Middlebrook was a Life Fellow of the IEEE, and a Fellow of the IEE (UK).

The role is portrayed by actor, Sean Blakemore and first appeared on January 24, 2011, on a recurring basis. On April 6, 2011, it is announced that Blakemore was put on contract with the series. On May 18, 2015, it was announced that Blakemore had taped his last scenes as Shawn and would be exiting the series. Butler returned for one day on November 19, 2015. Butler was visited by Sam and Jason Morgan in early April 2016. Casting and characterization Actor Sean Blakemore, known for his small roles on soap operas such as Days of Our Lives and The Young and the Restless, originated the role of Shawn Butler on January 24, 2011, on a recurring basis. In April, it was reported that Blakemore had signed a contract with the series. When Blakemore started to appear less frequently in February 2012, many fans were led to believe Blakemore had been left go. It was later confirmed that Blakemore had taken some time off to shoot a movie. During an interview with BE Magazine in October 2011, Blakemore discusses his character. He describes Shawn as someone with professional skills, but also a man with a lot of personal issues. Blakemore also states, ‚ÄîBlakemore BE Interview Character development Blakemore has complimented the writers of the series for his character's careful introduction. \\"He was hired [to kidnap Brenda], but it was brilliant how they introduced him with Molly. You could see Shawn for who he was. He worked for the wrong side but he had ethics. He came to Port Charles to shake it up but after meeting Molly, it was his life that was shaken up,\\" Blakemore stated. After a casting call was put out for an African-American teenager, there was some speculation that the role was going to be introduced as Shawn's son. This led to rumors that Shawn's family life was going to be explored, and more of his backstory would be revealed. The role was revealed to be T.J., the son of the Marine that Shawn had accidentally killed in the war. T.J., portrayed by Krys Meyer first appeared on January 17, 2012. When T.J. started to date Molly Lansing, there was much speculation that Shawn would become involved with Molly's mother, Alexis Davis (Nancy Lee Grahn). During the summer of 2012, it was confirmed that Shawn was going to be paired with Alexis romantically. Grahn said of the pairing \\"I love working with Sean Blakemore. I think he's very cool. His character needs to be more dimensionalized, but I'm all for putting Shawn and Alexis together. Frank and [head writer] Ron Carlivati know that I need to have a relationship on the show. Maybe they're just experimenting, seeing what works, what doesn't. It'd be good to start over with Alexis and Shawn and approach this thing again. Why are the two of them together? What's behind the attraction? I don't think they even know each other.\\" Storylines Backstory Shawn Butler was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. As a kid, Shawn admires his father Granigan. One night when Shawn is six years old, he and Ray go to store to buy some pants, and Shawn watches as his father is gunned down. Shawn is a former U. S. Marine and suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder; he also worked as Master Chef before enlisting in the marines. While stationed in Afghanistan, Shawn befriends fellow soldier Mo. Shawn is devastated when he accidentally kills Mo during a friendly fire incident. Shawn began suffering from PTSD when he accidentally injured a young girl in Afghanistan. Shawn's mother is deceased and he has there dollars. 2011‚Äì16 Shawn Butler first appears in January 2011, comforting Molly Lansing who is suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder after shooting Jerry Jacks. Shawn opens up about his own PTSD struggles and he helps her deal. Molly's aunt, Carly Corinthos Jacks later shows her gratitude by offering him a room at her hotel, which he declines. It is soon revealed that Shawn is working for Theo Hoffman, who is secretly operating as The Balkan, an international crime lord. On Theo's orders, Shawn is sent to kidnap Brenda Barrett on February 18, just before her wedding. However, several visitors get in his way and Shawn can't get to Brenda. He is later confronted by Sam McCall and her boyfriend, Jason Morgan who convince him help bring down Theo. Theo realizes Shawn has betrayed him and attempts to kill him. Carly finds a wounded Shawn on the side of the road and helps him recover before he is nearly killed by Sonny Corinthos. During Shawn's hospital stay, there is another attempt on his life. When serial killer, Franco begins menacing Carly and her daughter, Josslyn Jacks, Jason hires Shawn as bodyguard. When Carly's estranged husband, Jasper Jacks attempts to use Shawn's violent past against Carly during their custody hearing, Shawn quits. Shawn soon begins opening up about his past and family. In July 2011, after Jax is run out of town by Sonny, Shawn believing he'll be back begins paying more attention to Carly and her daughter. On August 8, Shawn attempts to stop Jax from leaving town with Josslyn, but his efforts are stalled when he has a PTSD attack. Shawn manages to get Josslyn back home before Jax leaves with assistance from Robin Scorpio. Shawn comforts Carly when Jax is presumed dead in a plane crash and he finds evidence that Jax is still alive. Shawn is later hired by Jason to take over his job temporarily while he is preparing to marry. Carly and Shawn continue to grow closer as he becomes more involved in the business when he protects Carly's son Michael from getting busted with drugs. However, Michael doesn't approve of his mother's and Shawn's budding relationship and even gets Sonny to fire him. In October 2011, after receiving a package from Franco, Carly and Shawn go to Hawaii to warn Jason who is on his honeymoon with new wife, Sam. They bond and ultimately share a kiss on October 27. In November 2011, on Veteran's Day, Shawn opens up to Carly about his friend and fellow marine Tommy Ashford whom he accidentally killed in Afghanistan and how his father was gunned down in front of him when he was a kid.

In February 2012, Shawn and Michael find common ground when Michael decides to go to college and Shawn ends up being his tutor. Shawn asks to escort Carly to the General Hospital Pulmonary benefit at the Metro Court, but she doesn't return his call. After much probing from T.J., Shawn confronts Carly and tells her he wants to be with her. When she doesn't return his feelings, Shawn backs off. In April 2012, Renelle is attacked and Shawn brings her to the PCPD. In the summer, Shawn defends Molly and T.J. when is it discovered that they have been seeing one another in secret, and he convinces Alexis that their relationship won't really cause any trouble. Eventually, Shawn asks Alexis on a date and soon after the two become a couple. After the disappearance of Jason Morgan who was shot and killed by Cesar Faison, Shawn becomes an associate of Sonny. After a time Alexis and Shawn call it quits. In mid to late 2013, he and Sonny are planning to take down Julian Jerome in which he and Ava Jerome were already rid of Jason. On May 22, 2015, Jordan informed him that he is T.J.'s real father. On May 27, 2015 he pleaded guilty to shooting Hayden Barnes and was sent to prison because Shawn's attorney and Sonny's half-brother Ric Lansing couldn't refute the evidence. Hayden visits Shawn in prison about who shot her. In early April 2016, Sam and Jason Morgan visit Shawn in Pentonville to discuss Hayden Barnes' shooting in 2015 after the wedding disaster at the All Saints Church. Reception Many fans and critics alike became interested in the potential of Shawn and Carly (Laura Wright). Then head writer, Robert Guza, Jr. began toying with the idea, even promoting an angle where Shawn and Carly fall for one another, with Jasper Jacks (Ingo Rademacher) standing by. However, due to Shawn's lack of storyline, many fans were against the pairing. But, what some fans like was that the story would be something new, and different from the characters Carly was usually paired with. When asked about the potential pairing, Wright revealed that she liked that the writers were playing them as the \\"Ross and Rachel\\" of daytime. When GH was appointed a new head writer, many believed the new blood, Garin Wolf would try something new; and Wolf appeared to be going in the direction. Wolf went ahead with the couple's first kiss on October 27, 2011 and caught the attention of many media outlets including, Entertainment Weekly. The pairing came in at No. 2 on Daytime Confidential's list of the Best Couples of 2011, saying that in the midst of rest of the stories being told at the time, which caused the ratings to dwindle, the potential pairing was the only one that showed promise. Yahoo! TV also praised the potential pairing citing chemistry between Blakemore and Wright as \\"undeniable\\" and they could potentially become a fan favorite couple; the article also said that Shawn was better than most of the men Carly had been previously paired with, most of whom were mobsters, with the exception of her estranged husband, Jax. The article also discusses the show's need for an interracial relationship to bring some diversity to the series. It mentions the short lived pairing of Ethan Lovett (Nathan Parsons) and Maya Ward (Annie Ilonzeh) as having great potential before the writers broke up the pairing. Sara Bibel of Xfinity also praised the pairing, and said they had the potential to become a truly great love story. She went on to say, \\"Carly‚Äôs newly single and has a thing for criminals. Shawn‚Äôs kindness towards Molly (Haley Pullos) indicates he will get along well with Carly‚Äôs kids. Blakemore is another one of casting director Mark Teschner‚Äôs amazing finds ‚Äî even if he represents a continuation of GH‚Äôs annoying habit of naming characters after the actors who play them. It takes a strong presence to go toe-to-toe with Wright. They have combustible chemistry. The characters also have enough internal and external obstacles that their story practically writes itself. Shawn‚Äôs PTSD gives him anger issues ‚Äî though after dealing with Sonny, Jason and Michael, Carly could probably teach a course in anger management. Shawn is currently at odds with the most important men in Carly‚Äôs life, Sonny and Jason. Shawn also brings some much needed ethnic diversity to GH, where people of color are usually relegated to the hospital ‚Äî far from the center of the action.\\" In 2012, Blakemore received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal of Shawn. The nomination came as a surprise to many because Shawn had only been on the canvas for a few months. Blakemore had to say on the experience, \\"It‚Äôs a phenomenal experience. I‚Äôm so excited to be recognized first of all by your counterparts who say, ‚ÄúHey, we really appreciate what you have to offer.‚Äù Then doing the show for such a short time, it's such a humbling experience and honor. I'm almost at a loss for words.\\" Eventually, Blakemore did not win the award, losing to fellow GH cast member Jonathan Jackson, who portrays Lucky Spencer. In 2016, Blakemore received his second nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a drama series and won the award for the first time.

The P Motors were not only more powerful than previous New York Central electric, but also a more advanced design using the highly successful 2-C+C-2 wheel arrangement found on the later PRR GG1 and New Haven EP-3 classes as well as nose suspended traction motors. Although originally built and owned by a consortium of railroads involved in the large scale Cleveland Union Terminal project, the New York Central was the majority owner and later acquired them outright in the 1950s when the Terminal's electrification scheme was scrapped in favor of diesels. Rebuilt and re-classified as P-2, the 21 remaining engines were sent to the New York electrified zone to supplement the aging fleet of T-Motors that had been purchased starting in 1913. There they played out the remainder of their careers pulling the Central's premier passenger trains. History In the 1920s the Van Sweringen brothers conceived of a new \\"Union\\" station for all trains coming into Cleveland via the various railroad lines in a concept similar to New York City's Grand Central Terminal. The new terminal would be situated under a large office and retail development including a 52-story tower. Not only that but from the subterranean platforms the trains would need to ascend a long steep ramp to a new bridge over the Cuyahoga River. As was with other underground station projects, the existing steam locomotive technology would be unacceptable due to the large amounts of exhaust gases and soot expelled from the smoke stack. The solution was an electrification project that would see passenger trains using the terminal switch to electric power before entering the confines of the station area. To build and equip this new railroad line, a consortium was formed to build the new track, bridge and electrical system as well as to buy a fleet of locomotives the power the trains. As the New York Central was to be the station's principle operator as well as the party responsible for maintenance at its Collingwood Yard shop facilities, the New York Central tapped long time electric locomotive team ALCO-GE to design and build the required units. The 22 unit strong fleet of P-1a locomotives were designed for the 3000 volt DC electrification system and could develop about 3000 horsepower. The units, painted in the New York Central style, but lettered for Cleveland Union Terminal went into service in 1929 and worked for the next 20 years running from Collingwood to Lindale and back with whatever passenger train needed to stop at the station. In 1951 as increasing use of diesel electric locomotives was making the use of electrics and their associated power changes unnecessary, the New York Central looked at converting the fleet to 660 DC third rail operation for use in its New York electrified zone, which had not seen a new delivery of a passenger locomotive since 1926. A single prototype, reclassified P-2a, was converted in the railroad's own Harmon Shops. After being proved satisfactory the remaining 20 units still in service were sent back to GE in 1955 to have the electrical equipment changed over. This work actually resulted in a rather significant weight savings with no loss of power or tractive effort. The lower-voltage motors installed, which had thinner insulation and more windings, resulted in a horsepower increase to 4243hp. The P-2 fleet continued in service pulling the New York Central's premier passenger trains between Croton-Harmon and Grand Central Terminal. A few survived into the Penn Central era, but after significant reductions in long distance passenger service in the 1970s the fleet was retired. All surviving units were scrapped starting in 1972 with none being preserved.

Huldrych Zwingli, pastor of Grossm√ºnster in Zurich, Switzerland, spearheaded the event by publicly speaking in favor of eating sausage during the Lenten fast. Zwingli defended this action in a sermon called Von Erkiesen und Freiheit der Speisen (Regarding the Choice and Freedom of Foods), in which he argued, from the basis of Martin Luther's doctrine of sola scriptura, that \\"Christians are free to fast or not to fast because the Bible does not prohibit the eating of meat during Lent.\\"  History  Smoked sausages Ulrich Zwingli was a pastor in Zurich, who was dedicated to the Reformation ideology of Martin Luther. His first rift with the established religious authorities in Switzerland came during the Lenten fast of 1522, when he was present during the eating of sausages at the house of Christoph Froschauer, a printer in the city. According to William Roscoe Estep, Zwingli had already held his convictions for some time before the incident. In March 1522, he was invited to partake of the sausage supper that Froschauer served not only to his workers, who, as he later claimed, were exhausted from putting out the new edition of The Epistles of Saint Paul but also to various dignitaries and priests. Because the eating of meat during Lent was prohibited, the event caused public outcry, which led to Froschauer being arrested. The planned provocation took place e.g. in the presence of Leo Jud, Klaus Hottinger and Lorenz Hochr√ºtiner, which all gained notoriety for Swiss reformation later. Froschauer himself published from 1525 on the Z√ºrich Bible.Gottfried W. Locher: Die Zwinglische Reformation im Rahmen der europ√§ischen Kirchengeschichte. G√∂ttingen, Z√ºrich: Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht 1979, S. 95‚Äì98, insbesondere Fn. 55 The meal involved Swiss Fasnachtskiechli and some slices of sharp smoked hard sausage, which had been stored for more than a year. Though he himself did not eat the sausages, Zwingli was quick to defend Froschauer from allegations of heresy. In a sermon titled Von Erkiesen und Freiheit der Speisen (Regarding the Choice and Freedom of Foods), Zwingli argued that fasting should be entirely voluntary, not mandatory. According to Michael Reeves, Zwingli was advancing the Reformation position that Lent was subject to individual rule, rather than the discipline which was upheld at the time by the Catholic Church. In Basel, a sort of more opulent Spanferkel-meal served the same purpose some time later.R. Wackernagel, \\"Spanferkelessen\\" in \\"Das Jahrzehnt der Reformation\\", 11. Buch, Geschichte der Stadt Basel (History of Basel), Band 3, Basel, 1924, p. 327f However the Zurich sausage affair was interpreted as demonstration of Christian liberty and kept being of similar importance for Switzerland as Martin Luther's 95 theses in Wittenberg for German reformation.Dorothea Meyer- Liedholz, Nicole Lang, Rahel Voirol-Sturzenegger, Christian Metzenthin, Monika Widmer Hodel: Wir glauben in Vielfalt; Theologischer Verlag Z√ºrich (Swiss schoolbook), Wurstessen f√ºr die Freiheit (eating sausage for freedom) p.201, 2011Martin Honecker: Wege evangelischer Ethik: Positionen und Kontexte; Saint- Paul, 2002, p. 185  Impact  After hearing of this indictment, Hugo von Hohenlandenberg, the Bishop of Konstanz, was so scandalized by Zwingli's preaching that he called for a mandate prohibiting the preaching of any Reformation doctrine in Switzerland. However, the damage had already been done, and Zwingli went on to become an extremely popular and revered figure in Swiss Protestantism, having contracted and recovered from the Black plague and drawn up sixty-seven theses (similar to Martin Luther's Ninety-five Theses) that denounced several long-standing beliefs of the Church of Rome. In culture The Affair is the subject of a 2016 cantata Geist und Wurst by Edward Rushton.

Produced by King Brothers Productions, it was co- written by Philip Yordan and directed by the German-American director Joe May, and constitutes the final film directed by Joe May.Turner Classic Movies It was based on a short story purchased by the King Brothers. Plot A young defense worker Kathie Aumont (Simone Simon) comes to Washington, D.C. only to find that her friend Sally, with whom she was going to live, is newly married. This leaves Kathie with nowhere to sleep. Luckily she falls in love with a newly inducted Marine, who gives her the key to his apartment. Unluckily he's also given keys to all his friends. The wartime housing shortage in various large urban areas was a recurrent subject for American comedies during World War II. This film was distinctive in that it was a comedy-fantasy. On a train headed from her home province of Quebec to New York City at the film's beginning, Kathie accidentally spills salt. Deeply superstitious, she believes this condemns her to seven weeks of bad luck. She is correct, as she is thereafter pursued by a mischievous gremlin (voiced by an uncredited Mel Blanc) whom only she can see who does things such as tamper with her alarm clock. The film's interest and charm derives in large part from its extremely varied cast of supporting players. Although Robert Mitchum's role in the film has come to be emphasized for marketing purposes, he was not yet a star and only appears in the last twenty minutes or so of the movie. Horror film staple Rondo Hatton speaks no lines and gets a laugh merely by appearing on screen briefly in a surprise appearance. Billy Laughlin, playing a child who lives in Simon's apartment building, was far better known at the time as \\"Froggy\\" in the Our Gang shorts, his only other film work.

He played for the St. George Illawarra Dragons in the National Rugby League (NRL), as a or . De Belin has played for Country NSW and New South Wales in the 2018 State of Origin series. Background De Belin was born in Cootamundra, New South Wales, Australia. Early career De Belin played part of his junior football career with St Gregory's College, Campbelltown and the Cootamundra Bulldogs in Group 9. He was then signed by St George Illawarra and competed in the 2011 National Youth Competition where he made it into the team of the year squad. First grade career De Belin made his first grade debut for St George Illawarra on 27 June 2011 against Manly and played three first grade matches that year. In 2014, De Belin signed a year extension deal with St George Illawarra which would see him play with the club until the end of 2017. He went on to make 21 appearances for St George Illawarra in the 2014 season. In 2015, de Belin was in the St George Illawarra side which made the finals but were eliminated by Canterbury-Bankstown in the first week. He made twenty two appearances for the season and was a regular in the lineup. 2016 saw de Belin make his representative debut when chosen to represent New South Wales Country in the annual City vs Country game. That year he again featured regularly in the Dragons' first grade line-up and made twenty-one appearances for the season. In 2017, de Belin was again chosen to represent New South Wales Country in what would be the final City vs Country match. In May 2017, de Belin was named in an extended New South Wales side to take on Queensland in Game 1 of the 2017 State of Origin series. Also in 2017, de Belin signed another three-year extension deal to stay at St George Illawarra until 2020. 2018 was a stellar season for de Belin. He was selected to play for New South Wales in the 2018 State of Origin series, played in all games of the series and was a key part of the Blues' 2-1 series victory. De Belin did not compete in the NRL in 2019 due to pending sexual assault charges. Sporting pedigree De Belin's grandfather Fred de Belin had a Sydney first grade career with the Balmain Tigers that was interrupted by four years of WWII active service in Europe with the RAAF as bomber. He toured with the Kangaroos of 1948-49 and played eight Tests for Australia from 1948‚Äì50. Jack's uncle Alan de Belin was a state and national representative lightweight rower from the Haberfield Rowing Club in Sydney. In 1977 in the Australian lightweight eight he won a bronze medal at the 1977 World Rowing Championships in Amsterdam. Sexual assault allegations On 13 December 2018, de Belin was charged by police with aggravated sexual assault following an encounter with a woman in Wollongong. The incident reportedly happened after the woman had left a nightclub with a group of men including de Belin. The woman was under the impression the group would head to another nightclub but ended up at an apartment block where it is claimed de Belin and de Belin's friend stripped naked and sexually assaulted her. On 28 February 2019, de Belin was stood down by St George Illawarra under the NRL's new 'no fault stand down policy', which allows players to train but not play until the completion of investigations in which players are charged with any serious criminal offence that has a maximum jail term of 11 years or more. On 17 May 2019, de Belin lost his federal court bid to be reinstated by the NRL. On 28 May 2019, de Belin was charged with two further counts of sexual assault. On 24 July 2019, De Belin was committed to stand trial over allegations of sexual assault. De Belin faces charges of five counts of rape. On 13 February 2020, it was announced that De Belin's trial would be delayed until April 8 2020 after a significant witness in the case had fallen ill and was unable to attend court.

Description Holothuria tubulosa grows to a length of between and , and a diameter of . It is roughly cylindrical with a flattened base on which there are three longitudinal rows of tube feet. It has a tough, leathery skin. The general colour is a shade of brown and the surface is covered with numerous dark-coloured, conical, thorn- like projections known as papillae.

It is found on sandy seabeds, among seagrass (Posidonia spp.) and on muddy rocks to a depth of about . Biology Male Holothuria tubulosa releasing sperm Holothuria tubulosa feeds on detritus, algae and plankton. It uses its tube feet to move across the surface or adhere to rocks. Holothuria tubulosa is dioecious, with each individual being either male or female but with no difference between them in external appearance. In a study in the Mediterranean Sea, a mass spawning event was observed in the afternoons of the two days in August 2003 that coincided with the full moon. Large numbers of mature individuals simultaneously adopted the spawning position, rearing their anterior ends up and leaving only the hind third of their body in contact with the seabed. This raises their genital orifices, situated just below the mouth, clear of the substrate to allow for maximum dispersal of the gametes. First, some individuals, believed to be males, emitted a whitish fluid which gradually dispersed in the surrounding water. Next, a smaller number of individuals, believed to be female, emitted a more viscous fluid, perhaps in response to the release of the male gametes. Each release lasted about 30 minutes. The necessary conditions for spawning seemed to be a full moon and a sea temperature of about . The fertilised eggs hatch in about 24 hours and the developing larvae are planktonic. They feed on microscopic algae and pass through several stages over the course of a few weeks before settling on the seabed and undergoing metamorphosis into juveniles.Sea cucumber culture Brief introduction to mariculture of five selected species in China.

He was the founder of Wheel Horse Products Co. Inc and was the primary inventor of the modern American riding mower. Early life and family Pond was born in South Bend, Indiana, to Elmer and Ann Marie Pond. He graduated from South Bend's former Washington- Clay High School, and served in the U.S. Army during World War II. In 1946, Pond returned to South Bend and in June of that year, married Betty Alber Pond. The Ponds had a son, Gary, and two daughters, Linda and Constance. Beginnings in business In 1946, Pond joined his father, who at the time was building two-wheel lawn tractors (which the operator would walk behind) from angle iron, surplus motorcycle and automotive parts in his garage. At first, the Ponds' company was simply called Pond Tractor Company, but when they discovered another family member owned a similarly-named company, \\"Wheel Horse\\" was chosen, and the name stayed with the company until its demise as a separate operation of the Toro companies in the 1980s. In the late 1940s, veterans returning from World War II began moving to the vast new suburbs then transforming the American landscape. Their homes had larger lots that demanded more attention and the Ponds' riding mower found many ready buyers as a result. In 1954, Pond introduced his first 4-wheel lawn tractor, an event which altered substantially the lawn care manufacturing business. By 1957, his Wheel Horse Products company recorded sales over $1 million (US$ in dollars) for the first time. Two years later, the company's sales more than doubled, to $4.5 million (US$ in dollars). Sale to American Motors Corporation In 1975, Pond sold Wheel Horse Products to American Motors Corporation. At the time, Pond had over 500 workers at his plant and over 3,000 dealers were selling the brand. Branching out into other businesses In the 1970s, Pond acquired Skystream Airlines, a small commuter airline in northern Indiana. Skystream, which was formed in September 1973, when it acquired routes once flown by Hub Airlines, Inc., served northern Indiana, Illinois and Michigan. Retrieved on January 15, 2012. Also in the 1970s, Pond purchased Lakeside Winery, formerly Molly Pitcher Vineyards, located in Harbert, Michigan. The vineyard/winery was the oldest in Michigan. Retrieved on January 15, 2012.

To the southeast lay the Midland Platform (a part of the micro-continent of Avalonia) and to the northwest, within the Iapetus Ocean, through what is now Ireland and the Lake District, was an island arc; a northeast-southwest aligned Irish Sea landmass which was associated with volcanic activity. Examination of the sediments and associated fossils allows the deeper centre of the basin to be distinguished from shallower 'platform' areas along its southeastern margins. From the middle Silurian onwards, collision of Avalonia with the more northerly continent of Laurentia occurred giving rise to the Caledonian Orogeny. The inversion of the basin occurred at that time i.e. its uplift and deformation. The southeastern limit of the Welsh Basin can be defined as the Welsh Borderland Fault Zone comprising the Pontesford-Linley Fault and Church Stretton Fault which stretch from Pembrokeshire to Shropshire and, in the northwest, the Menai Strait Fault Zone. Its extent to the southwest and northeast is uncertain as these areas are cloaked by more recent rocks. Siliciclastic material was derived from the landmass to its southeast Pretannia, some being deposited in the shallower margins before subsequently being redeposited as turbidites as the sediment mass became unstable from time to time.Howells, M.F. 2007 British Regional Geology: Wales (Keyworth, Nottingham, British Geological Survey) In addition to the sedimentary rocks of the Welsh Basin, there are a number of volcanic formations within the overall sequence, particularly within the Ordovician system.Hunter, A. & Easterbrook, G. 2004 The Geological History of the British Isles, The Open University, Milton Keynes Typical of the sediments of the Welsh Basin are the Llandovery age Aberystwyth Grits which outcrop along the middle coastal section of Cardigan Bay and comprise alternating mudstones and turbiditic sandstones.Toghill, P. 2000 The Geology of Britain: an introduction Airlife Publishing.

Formed in 1973, it provides free parenting and early childhood education programs to low-income, predominately Hispanic, families with children of up to three years of age. History AVANCE derives its name from the Spanish word for \\"advance\\" It originally started in 1973 as a 500-unit public housing development serving 35 families in San Antonio, Texas. Currently it encompasses more than 100 programs across the U.S.A. The number of participants in its early childhood education/parenting and family support services number several thousand. The concept of the organization is based on the educational theories of Urie Bronfenbrenner, of Cornell University, and whose graduate students established the first AVANCE program in Dallas, Texas in 1973. The founders received start-up funding from the Zale Corporation, which allowed for an expansion of the program to San Antonio. Premise The basis of the program is Dr. Bronfenrenner's (1979) observations of the impact of environmental factors on human development. This research suggested that factors external to the family were constraints to escaping from poverty cycles, and the research aimed to provide model for intervention. The Parent-Child Education Program, adopted by AVANCE, focuses on the role of both parent and child. It assists parents by providing a stable home environment improving the parents' language and work skills, their parenting knowledge, and increasing their awareness of community services. Parent-Child Education Program The principal program AVANCE promotes is the Parent-Child Education Program. This aims to help parents create a cognitively rich environment. Teachers seek to do this by encouraging parents to stimulate their children's development through talking to them, praising them and interacting with the world around them. The New York Times referred to the goal of AVANCE as \\"Teaching mothers how to teach their children.\\"\\"The New York Times1\\" The program is structured in two tiers, with the first addressing the child's basic needs, such as food, clothing, shelter, and medical services. The second stage focuses on the parents' educational needs, where applicable, with the aim of improving the home environment and parents' employment options. The Parent-Child Education Program consists of weekly three-hour classes that are designed to mirror the local school calendar and comprises curricula based on Play and Toys, Parenting Education, Home Visits, and Community Resource Awareness.\\"The AVANCE Model\\" The average participant in the program is a low-income Hispanic mother in her mid- twenties, with 2-3 children. However, it also includes fathers, grandparents and primary guardians or caregivers of children up to three years of age. The majority of participants possess no higher than a ninth-grade education and limited or no work experience.\\"Focus\\" A core tenet of the program is to provide practical support in order to encourage parental participation by arranging transport to and from program services, providing free meals, and employing bilingual staff from the same communities as participants. Individuals are not charged for participating in the program. Assessment of effectiveness The effectiveness of the Parent-Child Education Program was evaluated over a four-year period, from 1987-1991 with support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York. The evaluation studied a group of 486 individuals, comprising 207 participants in the AVANCE program and 279 in a control group. The data collected related to maternal knowledge, behavior, attitudes and continuing education. The study continued over a two-year period and concluded that \\"most of the program goals were attained to an impressive degree.\\" It found the two-generation Parent-Child Education Program for low- income families to be beneficial in such aspects as the home learning environment, maternal behaviors and attitudes towards children. A review of the program in Early Childhood Education Journal found that children in the AVANCE-Dallas chapter academically outperformed their peers. In the 2005 TAKS (Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills), 88% of child graduates met the passing standard for reading, compared with 73% in the Dallas Independent School District and 83% in the state. A 1991 survey of 23 women and 32 children who had participated in AVANCE's first program group showed that 94% of those children had completed high school, received a General Equivalency Diploma (GED) or were still in education.\\"Compendium of Comprehensive, Community-based Initiatives\\" In addition, 57% of the mothers who had previously dropped out of school went back and resumed studies, subsequently attaining a GED. As part of a 1994 report into the state of care for children in U.S.A., the Carnegie Corporation commented on the AVANCE programs: \\"Evaluations show that Avance (sic) programs improve families' ability to provide an emotionally stimulating and nurturing environment for their young children, positively influence mothers' childrearing attitudes and knowledge, and expand mother's use of community resources.\\" This was at a time, the report continued, when three million children, comprising almost 25% of all American infants and toddlers, lived in poverty. Dr. Susan B. Neuman investigated AVANCE's Parent-Child Education program as part of research into early intervention initiatives. She is Professor in Educational Studies at the University of Michigan, a former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Elementary and Secondary Education, and was primarily responsible for implementing the No Child Left Behind Act. The AVANCE program was one of nine non-school intervention initiatives that Dr. Neuman examined. She found high performance levels for children who had participated in the program. 100% of children scored excellent or satisfactory on the Dallas school district's kindergarten test of pre-reading skills. Dr. Neuman concluded that AVANCE and the other programs demonstrated \\"impressive results\\". External recognition In 2009 AVANCE was awarded the E Pluribus Unum Prize, presented by the Migration Policy Institute's National Center on Immigration Integration Policy. This award is given in recognition of initiatives that help immigrants and their children to adapt and contribute to the United States. In January 2012, AVANCE was awarded the Simmons Luminary Award for education excellence by Southern Methodist University. The work of the organization has been commented upon by former First Ladies, Hillary Clinton, Rosalynn Carter and Barbara Bush, in relation to education. In a 1999 forum on educational initiatives and issues held in Washington D.C., Clinton described AVANCE as \\"...one of the most effective home-building programs of support. If you're not familiar with it, you should see it and read about it.\\" She also referenced the organization in her book, It Takes a Village. Rosalynn Carter, in discussing the effectiveness of several organizations in the promotion of mental well-being, described AVANCE as one of those programs which \\"...have in common efforts to reduce the risk factors that can contribute to mental illness while they enhance protective factors that can help keep our children well.\\" Separately, The Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy recognized AVANCE among ten innovative family literacy programs that focused on early intervention. The organization was also included in a 1997 book and photographic exhibition called Pursuing the Dream, a joint venture between award-winning photographer, Stephen Shames and the Family Resource Coalition (FRC). This was the culmination of a two-year photographic record that Shames created depicting community programs serving disadvantaged youth and families and helping them achieve financial and emotional stability. AVANCE was ranked by Hispanic Business Magazine as one of the top 25 non-profit organizations supporting Hispanic people in the U.S.A. in 2011. Funding AVANCE operates through donations from business organizations and individuals. In addition, AVANCE receives donations from churches, food banks, schools, government agencies, social and civic groups. Some universities also allow the organization to use their campuses for graduation ceremonies.

Municipally, it serves as the administrative center of Nebolchskoye Urban Settlement, one of the two urban settlements in the district. Population: History The area was first mentioned in 1564 as Yegoryevsky Pogost in Nebolchi. In the 19th century, it belonged to Tikhvinsky Uyezd of Novgorod Governorate. In the beginning of the 20th century, there was no settlement, and the current area of Nebolchi was covered by woods. The settlement of Nebolchi was founded in 1916 when the railway station was opened. In 1918, Tikhvinsky Uyezd, including Nebolzhi, was transferred to the newly established Cherepovets Governorate. On August 1, 1927 the governorate was abolished, and the area was transferred to Leningrad Oblast. Simultaneously, uyezds were abolished in favor of districts. In particular, Zhukovsky District with the center in the selo of Zhukovo was established, as part of Leningradsky Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930 the okrugs were abolished, and the districts became directly subordinate to the oblast. On March 11, 1931, Zhukovsky District was renamed into Dregelsky District. On June 20, 1933 the district center was transferred to Nebolchi. Dregelsky District was partially occupied by German forces between October 31 and December 8, 1941. Nebolchi was not occupied, but played an important role in delivering goods to the troops. In 1944, the district was transferred to Novgorod Oblast. On February 1, 1962 Dregelsky District was abolished. After a number of reforms, in 1965 the area of the former district, including Nebolchi, was included into Lyubytinsky District. Nebolchi was granted urban- type settlement status on January 8, 1963. Economy Industry In industry, there is timber industry present. There is also a bakery. Transportation Nebolchi is a railway junction station. The main line passing through Nebolchi is the one connecting Sonkovo and Mga. Another railway branching off south connects Nebolchi via Lyubytino with Okulovka, which lies on the main line connecting Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Nebolchi is connected by roads via Boksitogorsk with A113 highway which connects Vologda and Saint Petersburg, via Lyubytino and Malaya Vishera with M10 highway which connects Moscow and Saint Petersburg, and with Budogoshch. There are also local roads.

It was instituted on 31 March 1942 by the commander-in-chief () Hermann G√∂ring. The badge, designed by the graphic and textile artist Sigmund von Weech (1888-1982), features an oak leaf wreath with at its apex a Luftwaffe eagle, grasping a swastika, flying above a storm cloud, from which a lightning bolt strikes rough ground. The general criteria for its presentation was the participation in three separate combat operations on separate days. Luftwaffe soldiers who had already been awarded medals or orders of the Heer such as Assault Badge or the Infantry Assault Badge, were required to exchange their badges for the Ground Assault Badge of the Luftwaffe. As the war progressed it became necessary to further distinguish those soldiers who had already exceeded the awarding criteria. To accomplish this distinction four numbered grades were introduced on 10 November 1944 based on the number of combat operations. * 2nd grade (II. Stufe) for 25 eligible operations * 3rd grade (III.

He fought for the 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS during World War II and the Latvian partisans during the Guerrilla war in the Baltic states.  Biography  Pƒìteris Dzelzƒ´tis was born on September 21, 1921 near the village of Renda, in a family of farmers. He was educated in the Renda primary school. In 1943, Dzelzƒ´tis, along with his brother Vidvuds, was enlisted in the 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS. Vidvuds was killed on March 17, 1944, during a battle on the eastern shore of the Velikaya River. The 19th Division gradually retreated to the region of Kurzeme, where they stayed until the war ended (the so-called Courland Pocket). Pƒìteris, along with some others, did not surrender to the Red Army and instead started guerrilla warfare. Their group consisted of seven men. Pƒìteris was its leader. He used codename \\"Kurmis\\" (Mole). On February 2, 1948, the Soviets found the group's hiding place and raided it. Three of seven group members were killed in action, the other four, including Dzelzƒ´tis, were taken away for further questioning. The NKVD beat him up several times in an attempt to extract information, however, he did not reveal anything. He was executed on February 16.  Legacy  He is considered to be a hero in Renda. In the early 1990s, not long after Latvia regained its independence, a commemorative plaque was attached to the Renda primary school. There was a movement which aimed to name a street in the nearby city of Kuldƒ´ga in memory of Dzelzƒ´tis, but it failed.

He studied architecture at the Rhode Island school of Design (BFA 1990 / B.Arch 1991) and received a Masters in Architectural Studies from Harvard University (M.Arch 1993). His work has been extensively published by the professional press. Khoury started an independent practice in 1993. Over the past fifteen years, his office has developed an international reputation and a significant diverse portfolio of projects both locally and abroad. Background Khalil Khoury, a Lebanese architect and designer, is his father. Khalil Khoury worked with exposed concrete and designed the Mont La Salle School Campus, the Municipal Stadium of Jounieh and the Interdesign Showroom building. Khoury‚Äôs father also produced work at differing scales ranging from the design and production of furniture items to his participation in the development of the master plan for the reconstruction of the Beirut Central District in 1977. Bernard Khoury lived in and out of Lebanon during the early years of the Civil War where he scarcely made it through secondary school, before pursuing his architectural studies in the United States of America. He received his Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1990, a Bachelor of Architecture in 1991 from the Rhode Island School of Design, and a Masters in Architectural Studies in 1993 from Harvard University. Career Khoury started his professional career soon after his graduate studies in post-war Beirut, which became his territory of experimentation where he produced 16 unbuilt projects spanning a period of four years (1993-1997). During the early years of his practice, he was financially supported by his family‚Äôs furniture manufacturing business that provided him with a design studio and gave him access to the workshop and manufacturing facilities of their factories. Khoury first came to public and critical attention with the completion of the B018 music club in 1998, his first built project. This building sparked a string of temporary projects, through which Khoury built a reputation for his ability to produce critical interventions in problematic zones. These include his first six built projects: the Centrale project (2000), Yabani (2001), the BLC Bank (2004), the Bank of Beirut pavilion in Chtaura (2005), as well as the Black Box (2005). In the media, various publications dubbed Khoury \\"the bad boy\\" of architecture in the Middle East. Khoury's early clients came primarily from the entertainment industry. He then produced projects for local banks. His first international commission, the Pfefferberg Project, was in Berlin, Germany (1999-2001) and consisted of the conversion of an industrial block into a cultural quarter. Aborted commissions followed in Europe, including the Santa Cesarea project in Italy (2007), as well as residential projects in England, Spain and Serbia. He then worked on commissions such as the Tumo Center for Creative Technologies (2011), the Tumo Park (2011) and the Epygi Park Master Plan (2013) in Yerevan, Armenia, as well as the AGBU NKR Campus (2014) in Nagorno-Karabakh. He has also worked in the Arab world. These comprise schemes in the Arabian Gulf region, such as the Fintas Market (2003) and the Andalus Development (2006) in Kuwait; the Alargan Business Bay Development (2006) and the Ajman Resort (2012-2013) in the United Arab Emirates; Al Qurm Mixed Use Development (2012) in Oman; Surramanraa (2005) in Riyadh; and the Suspended Gardens of Manama (2011) in Bahrain. Khoury‚Äôs first permanent building, IB3, was completed in 2006. IB3 was followed by Plot # 732 (2008), Plot # 183 (2009) and Plot # 893 (2010), all of which engage their surrounding urban fabric. These were followed by the developments on Plots # 1314 and 2251 (2013) in Beirut, in which Khoury designed his own residence. Plot # 4371 (2009), a more recent residential project, allows its inhabitants to move their vehicles vertically within the buildings to park them in the center of their living room. Plot # 1282 (2010, also known as Factory Lofts) is characterized by its thin slabs and openness on all orientations, stretching over 166 meters in length with a perimeter of 430 linear meters.

Early life Jeremy James Arel was born September 7, 1981 in Northampton, Massachusetts. He began martial arts at an early age thanks to the inspiration from his uncle, Martial Arts Hall of Famer Robert Arel. At 7 he began Isshin-Ryu and then moved to Jeet Kune Do . During his time training Jeet Kune Do he began a rigorous training schedule that would set the pace for the rest of his martial arts career, training as much as possible outside of academic classes. After 6 years of Jeet Kune Do his academy changed directions and began opening up the style to encompass ‚ÄúMMA‚Äù training. Under his academy's belt system he achieved the rank of black belt and began competing in boxing, kickboxing, and grappling tournaments. During this time Arel also competed for an alternate position on the World Kickboxing Association's US National Kickboxing Team. In 2004, after serving with the US Army National Guard in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Arel began his career in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu when he joined an Alliance Jiu Jitsu affiliate in Charlotte, NC. He achieved the rank of purple belt under the guidance of the late Luis Togno. After several additional years of training in a no-gi combat style jiu jitsu, Arel made the decision to make Brazilian Jiu Jitsu his life's work and dedicate himself full-time to attaining the rank of black belt. In 2009 Arel moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and achieved the rank of brown belt under the legendary Gracie Barra black belt Roberto ‚ÄúGordo‚Äù Correa. After a brief return home he once again traveled to Rio where he was promoted to black belt under Gordo on December 11, 2010. Jeremy Arel is a graduate from Winthrop University with a degree in Health & Physical Education and is the owner/head instructor of Great Grappling Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in Fort Mill, SC, just outside Charlotte, NC. Sherdog Blog / Brazil In May 2009 Jeremy made a decision that would alter the course of his life when he committed to moving to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to continue his training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Arel documented his travels, training, and stories through a blog maintained on Sherdog.com's grappling forums under the avatar ‚ÄúGerbilJiuJitsu‚Äù. This blog served to share his stories with the worldwide grappling community as he experienced life as a gringo in Brazil. On this thread he discusses life at the ConnectionRio house, training at Roberto ‚ÄúGordo‚Äù Correa's school, and his progression from purple, to brown, and eventually black belt. The blog's popularity exploded with over 1 million views and BJJ players from around the world began traveling to ConnectionRio on the recommendation and experiences from Arel's writings. ‚ÄúThe Gerbil‚Äù can be credited as having a tremendous influence on inspiring BJJ and MMA athletes from around the world to travel and train in Brazil. YouTube Channel On the heels of the success of his Sherdog.com blog, Arel's new project is a series of instructional videos on YouTube.com. His opinion is that there are no secrets in BJJ and he wishes to share his knowledge with the community for the purpose of growing the level of competition in the sport worldwide. These videos follow the same curriculum taught by Arel in his academy. Once the 200+ videos from his core curriculum have been made available, he plans to begin producing no-gi and advanced technique videos as well.

It appears to be transmitted by midges (Culicoides spp.) which are likely to have been most active in causing the infection in the northern hemisphere summer and autumn of 2011, with animals subsequently giving birth from late 2011. Schmallenberg virus falls in the Simbu serogroup of orthobunyaviruses. It is considered to be most closely related to the Sathuperi and Douglas viruses. The virus is named after Schmallenberg, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, from where the first definitive sample was derived. After Germany, it has also been detected in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Ireland, Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, Norway, Poland and Estonia. The virus has been recognised by the European Commission's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and the Friedrich- Loeffler-Institut (German Research Institute for Animal Health).Schmallenberg virus: new Orthobunyavirus in cattle , updated 10 January 2012, accessed 16 January 2012 A risk assessment in December 2011 did not consider it likely to be a threat to human health,Risk assessment: New Orthobunyavirus isolated from infected cattle and small livestock ‚îÄ potential implications for human health, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 22 December 2011, accessed 17 January 2012 as other comparable viruses are not zoonotic. Immunity can possibly be acquired naturally against SBV. It is possible that the seasonality of the infection cycle would not entail a second epidemic circulation next year, due to the shortness of the viraemic period (about 4 to 6 days post exposure, longer in affected foetuses). Vaccination is a possible option for controlling the disease as a vaccine exists for the similar Akabane virus.SMC(UK) Fact Sheet on Schmallenberg virus In March 2012, scientists of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut first succeeded in producing an electron microscope image of the Schmallenberg virus.  Molecular biology  (A) Phylogenetic relationship between Schmallenberg virus and orthobunyaviruses of the Simbu, Bunyamwera, and California serogroups. (B) Detection of Schmallenberg virus genome in the blood of experimentally infected calves. The genetic structure of Schmallenberg virus is typical for Bunyavirales viruses, which are a family of enveloped negative-sense single stranded RNA viruses with a genome split into three parts‚ÄîSmall (S), Medium (M) and Large (L). The L RNA segment encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L protein), the M RNA segment encodes two surface glycoproteins (Gc and Gn) and a nonstructural protein (NSm), while the S RNA segment encodes a nucleocapsid protein (N) and, in an alternative overlapping reading frame, a second nonstructural protein (NSs). The genomic RNA segments are encapsidated by copies of the N protein in the form of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. The N protein is the most abundant protein in virus particles and infected cells and, therefore, the main target in many serological and molecular diagnostics.  Signs of disease  The virus causes two different profiles of Schmallenberg: *Fever of short duration, diarrhoea and reduced production of milk in cows These disease signs have occurred during the period when the disease vectors (mosquitos, sandflies, midges) are active, during the summer and autumn of 2011, mainly affecting cattle. *Stillbirths and birth defects in sheep, cattle and goats Congenital malformations in newborn sheep, goats and calves are the most obvious symptoms. In many cases, the dam apparently has not presented signs of illness. These cases have occurred from December 2011, especially in sheep. The major malformations observed were: scoliosis, hydrocephalus, arthrogryposis, hypoplasia of the cerebellum and an enlarged thymus. Diagnosis Blood samples from live animals with suspicious symptoms are taken for analysis. Dead or aborted fetuses suspected of having the virus are sampled by taking a piece of the brain or spleen for analysis. The samples are tested with the RT-PCR for Schmallenberg virus that has been developed by the Friedrich-Loeffler Institute in Germany. A commercial kit is now available from AdiaVetSBV - Schmallenberg Virus PCR Detectction Kit which targets the L region of the tripartite ssRNA genome of the virus.Genbank: Schmallenberg virus RdRp gene for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, segment L, genomic RNA, isolate BH80/11-4  Cases in the United Kingdom  The disease was confirmed as present in the UK on 22 January 2012, on being formally identified in four sheep farms in Norfolk, Suffolk and East Sussex. By 27 February 2012, the disease was reported in other counties in the south of England including the Isle of Wight, Wiltshire, West Berkshire, Gloucestershire, Hampshire and Cornwall. It is likely that it was carried to Eastern England by midges from mainland Europe, a possibility previously identified as a risk by Defra.  Import bans  Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Egypt and Mexico have all suspended imports of live cattle and sheep, along with embryos and semen from affected countries. United States ban import of bovine germplasm collected in EU countries after June 1, 2011.

It was established by the Prime Ministerial Decree no.1511/1992 and was extended by Decree 33/1996 where Dahab marine section was added to the protected area as a Dahab Environmentally Managed Area DEMA and finally having NABQ Managed Resource Protected Area which is known shortly as (NMRPA).  Management institutional framework  The Protected Area Management Unit (PAMU) of Nabq is one of the Sinai Protected Area Net Work which is affiliated to the Central Department of the Protected Areas in Egypt under the Nature Conservation Sector of EEAA. The PAMU is responsible of controlling, developing protection actions, cooperation with stakeholders, enforcing the environmental laws (law 102/1983 and law 4/1994) and reporting the Sinai Regional PA Office in Sharm El Sheikh, which in turn reports to NCS/EEAA in Cairo.  NMRPA management objectives  The protected area had the status of Managed Resource Protected Area (MRPA) IUCN Category VI which is managed mainly for sustainable use of natural ecosystem. It is an area containing mostly unmodified natural systems, managed to ensure long-term protection and maintenance of biological diversity, while at the same time providing a sustainable flow of natural products and services to meet community needs. Accordingly, the main proposed management objectives for NMRPA are: *To maintain the natural and cultural resources in good conditions and conserve NPA biodiversity. *To enhance the sustainable utility of natural resources in the PA. *To promote NPA as a focal point for ecotourism in the region, and supporting socio-economic benefits to the local community *To increase public understanding and appreciation of NPA natural and cultural heritage.  Management issues, policies and actions  Twenty five management issues have been identified. Management issues include problems that currently or potentially could degrade the values of NMRPA, as well as opportunities such as development of ecotourism, and obligations for the Protected Area Management Unit (PAMU) such as visitor safety. For each management issue, approaches and specific actions are identified within a comprehensive framework reflecting and reinforcing the primary objectives of the PA.  Resources of NMRPA  NMRPA is characterized by a great diversity of habitats and ecosystems in a uniquely compact setting, representing a complete terrestrial/marine ecosystem which characterizes the Gulf of Aqaba coast. The region has a fascinating natural beauty and outstanding biological diversity. The coral reefs are among the best and most diverse in the Egyptian Red Sea (208 species of hard coral), and are the home for a great number of fish (438 species) and marine invertebrates. They have enormous economic value, providing the basis for international tourism activities and sustain local Bedouin fisheries. NMRPA includes a significant stand of mangrove resources of Egypt, a mangle of Avicennia marina extends for 4.5 kilometers in a semi- continuous fringe which is considered the extreme northern mangrove in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean system, It forms important nurseries for economically important fish and nesting sites for many of the region‚Äôs water birds. Substantial sea grass beds provide food for the threatened green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), and dugong (Dugong dugon). The interior of the PA is a complex pristine mountain wilderness, inhabited by a diversified wildlife, including several endangered species, and representing enormous attractions for ecotourism activities. Wadi El Keed watershed is one of the largest drainage basins to the Gulf of Aqaba on the Egyptian side. It can be considered as the best-vegetated wadi all over the Gulf, having the biggest aggregation of the Arak Sand Dunes (Salvadora persica) representing a unique vegetation. There are more than 20 globally threatened species known in NMRPA. The most significant species for which NMRPA can make an important contribution towards their global conservation are marine turtles, sharks, dugong, osprey (Pandion haliaetus), white-eyed gull (Larus leucophthalmus), dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), and Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana). The area is inhabited by local peoples (Bedouin) belonging to El Mezina Tribe, who still practice their traditional lifestyle largely in harmony with their environment and mainly are living on fishing, pasture and tourism. The area has an archaeological site at Wadi Saialet Dalal has been made in the old time by the Bedouin. Natural systems are still intact and no development occurred in the area, except for mining and quarrying for albite at Wadi El Samra and the old inactive copper mine which may be activated in the near future.

It is a gastronomic event where snails are the protagonists and which incorporates music, brass bands and parades through the city. In 2010 there were 200,000 visitors and twelve tons of snails were consumed. These are shipped in from Spain, North Africa and South America. Apart from the snail feast, the event includes numerous other activities such as concerts and charanga music, castells, performances, and competitions.  History  thumb In 1980, with about 12 clubs an event which incorporated a parade through the city of Lleida was born. About 300 club members participated in the first Aplec and around 4,000 visitors attended the first gastronomic demonstration of Lleida. The club of the Order of Caragol was l‚ÄôAplec‚Äôs mother club. The Order of Caracol gathered a group of 18 clubs to spend the day on the shore of river Segre. Thus they asked collaboration and authorization to the Lleida City Council to make the Aplec in the poplar grove next to the river in the neighborhood of Cappont. On April 1, 1981, the Order of Caragol sent the first notice to the clubs where they informed of the main agreements adopted at the last meeting of representatives of clubs and of the registration of 34 clubs and 2,300 participants in the following Aplec del Caragol. Also in 1981, the Aplequet or Aplec de Tardor was born. In the first weekend of October, it gathered up to 60 clubs and 3,000 club members with a tribute to the origins of Aplec when it was a one-day celebration. Acrobatic formation at the 2005 gathering In the fourth celebration of l‚ÄôAplec del Caragol an album with folk songs from Lleida including one dedicated to the snail was recorded. In 1986, l'Aplec del Caragol was included in the program of la Festa Major de Lleida. A week before the celebration of l'Aplec, on May 8, 1988, Lleida entered the Guinness Book of Records with the achievement of a world record: the realization of the world's largest tray of snails. In 1990 a new edition of the album l‚ÄôAplec del Caragol was presented with nine popular songs from Lleida with lyrics and music of the brothers Angel and Joan Martinez and with the collaboration of Manuel Peralta, Eduardo Quijada and the Federation of Clubs of l 'Aplec. In 1994 the first democratic assembly of the Aplec is constituted. The Aplec of 1997 was starred with the celebration of the first Cultural Week and the first Caragol Rock, with the participation of Terrorvision, Los Sencillos and Caf√© Soul.

He traveled in Europe.  Teacher  Seliminski returned to Sliven in 1825. He opened a school in which he taught physics. His school became one of the first Bulgarian lower level secondary schools.  Evacuation in Bessarabia  On the eve of the Russian-Turkish War (1828 - 1829) he organized many Bulgarians to support the Russian army. With the creation of revolutionary organizations in Sliven and some other cities, Seliminski became the first major Bulgarian revolutionary. After the war Seliminski participated in Russian delegations. Many Bulgarian people left their homes and emigrated to the other side of the Danube in Vlahia. Ivan Seliminski opened a school and was a teacher in New Sliven (now Berjazka) and Bucharest.  Medical Doctor  From 1840 to 1844 Seliminski studied medicine in Athens. After that he traveled to Paris (1845) and practiced as a medical doctor in Bucharest, Braila and Bessarabia until the end of his life (1845 - 1866).

Biography Newsam carried on business in London as a clockmaker, apparently from the date of Queen Elizabeth's accession in 1558. He obtained from the crown a thirty years' lease of premises in the Strand, near Somerset House, on 8 April 1565, and there he resided through life. Newsam was skilled in his craft, and was on familiar terms with Sir Philip Sidney and other men of influence at court. About 1572 the post of Clock- master to the Queen was promised him on the death of Nicholas Urseau (Ursiu, Veseau, or Orshowe). The latter had held the office under Queen Mary, and was reappointed to it by Queen Elizabeth. Newsam succeeded to the office before 1582. On 4 June 1583 he received, under the privy seal dated 27 May previous, \\"32s. 8d. for mending of clockes\\" during the past year. With the post of clockmaker he combined that of clock-keeper; the two offices had been held by different persons in Queen Mary's reign, and Newsam appears to have been the first Englishman appointed as clock-keeper. On 5 August 1583 Newsam wrote \\"to the ryghte honorable his very speciall good ffriend Sr ffrancis Walsingham, knighte\\", beseeching him \\"to be mindfull unto her Ma[jes]tie of my booke concerninge my long and chargeable suite, wherein I have procured Sir Philipp Sidney to move you for th' augmentinge of the yeares (if by any meanes the same may be)\\"; i.e. probably for an extension of his lease of the house in the Strand. On 6 September 1583, by letters patent, a lease for twenty-one years was granted to Newsam of lands \\"at Fleete in Lincolnshire, formerly the property of Henry, marquis of Dorset, late duke of Suffolk; also a water-mill at Wymondham, Norfolk, with fishings, &c.;, formerly property of the monastery of Wymondham ‚Ä¶ also all the weare of Llanlluney, co. Pembroke, and two garden plots lying in Firkett's Fields, in the parish of St. Clement Danes without Temple Bar\\", etc. The property in Pembroke had formerly belonged to Jasper, Duke of Bedford. Newsam also owned lands in Coney Street, in the parish of St. Martin, York. cites Newsam's will He died before 18 December 1593, when his will was proved by Parnell, his widow. There is in the British Museum a striking clock made by Newsam, which is still in almost untouched condition. It is of gilded brass, richly engraved. It is very small, not more than four inches high, and contains a compass; it has, of course, no pendulum, and but one hand. It is signed \\"Bartilmewe Newsum\\". The case is divided into two stories, the going train being in the upper, and the striking train in the lower storey. Both the trains are arranged vertically, so that the clock is wound from underneath. The wheels are of iron, or perhaps steel, the plates and frames being of brass. It has fusees cut for catgut, which are long, and only slightly tapered. The hand is driven directly from the going fusee at right angles, by means of a contrate-wheel. The escapement is of the verge kind, and it has no balance-spring. The bequests in Newsam's will confirm the evidence of his skill afforded by this clock. Mention is made there of: *\\"a strickinge clocke in a silken purse, and a sonnedyall to stand upon a post in his garden\\" *\\"a cristall Jewell with a watch in it garnished with goulde\\" *\\"a sonnedyall of copper gylte;\\" of \\"a watch gylte to shew the hower\\" *\\"a great dyall in a greate boxe of ivory, with two and thirteth poyntes of the compos\\" *\\"chamber clocke of five markes price\\" Family Newsam married Parnell Younge, in the church of St. Mary-le-Strand on 10 September 1565. He left four children: William (born 27 December 1570), Edward, Margaret, and Rose. Edward, \\"on condicion that he become a clockmaker as I am\\", was to have his father's tools, except his \\"best Vice save one, a beckhorne to stand upon borde, a greate fore-hammer, and [two] hand hammers, and a grete long beckhorne in my back shoppe\\"; all these were to go to John Newsam of York, a clockmaker, and presumably a relative.

He currently lives and works between Paris and Beirut. He studied cinematography at the Acad√©mie Libanaise des Beaux-Arts ALBA Beirut and then photography at the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure Louis Lumi√®re (Paris) before engaging in the theory of arts and languages at the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales. Work The artistic approach of Nadim Asfar is strongly influenced by the numerous questions raised by the language and technique of photography. His photographs and films attempt to capture his relationship to the outside world. Interrogating the relationships between apparatus, body and space, he produces works that explore time and space, whether in the interior, intimate realm of the house or in the wide expanses of natural landscapes. Stemming from a background that is both experimental and theoretical, his approach is at the meeting of considerations that are visual and acoustic, poetic and aesthetic, philosophical and anthropological. He presented his first solo exhibition ‚ÄúJuin‚Äù at Fadi Mogabgab Gallery (Beirut), in 2004. In 2005, he was part of \\"Regards des photographes arabes contemporains\\", a collective exhibition of Arab photographers at the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris. He showed a comprehensive selection of works in ‚ÄúImmaterial World‚Äù, organized in 2008 by Naila Kettaneh Kunigk and Sandra Dagher. In 2009, his project Innenleben was selected in Exposure, the Beirut Art Center‚Äôs first annual presentation of emerging artists. The same work was published in the Issue 20 / Talent of Foam Magazine and later on presented in Galerie Tanit's booth at Paris Photo. A popular series is the Constellations. Each piece is a grid composition of a varying number of pictures Nadim Asfar shot from the balcony of his apartment in Mar Mkhayel, Beirut. This work was exhibited at Galerie Tanit, Paris Photo and the FFA headquarters. He later reclaimed this work in 2018 in the form of an artist‚Äôs book, ‚ÄúHabiter le Jour‚Äù, focusing on the gestures, postures and stilled movements of anonymous passersby and on the passage of cars, motorcycles, trucks and other vehicles. Also in 2018, Nadim Asfar published another photographic book presenting an array of images of flowers and diverse plants that he had taken in his early career using the photogram technique which is a camera-less technique that produced floral photogenic drawings. These are placed in direct relationship with images of Beirut and of the family apartment from the balcony of which these plants were gathered before being placed under the developer. Starting 2014, Nadim Asfar began work on ‚ÄúExperiencing the Mountain‚Äù, a project dealing with the mountainous landscape of Lebanon, taking the role of a land surveyor, capturing thousands of photographs across the country. In this work, he interrogates the role of aesthetic representation and of the photographer‚Äôs point of view in landscape photography as much as the role of beauty and poetry in a nationalized politicized and war-affected territory. This endeavour was inaugurated with a short film shown for the first time at the Heartland ‚Äì Territoires d‚ÄôAffects exhibition at the Beirut Exhibition Center in 2015. A selection of photographs in large-scale formats were displayed at the ‚ÄúWhere I End and You Begin‚Äù exhibition at Galerie Tanit in 2016 and again at the Beiteddine Palace at the occasion of its annual festival in 2018.

Plot One evening, a penniless woman in an old hood is walking on the street, carrying a basket with a baby in it. She then lays it by the door of a wax museum owned by Oswald. The woman knocks on the door and leaves. Oswald opens up and sees what's in front of him. In doubt that he would make a good caretaker, however, the rabbit is reluctant to take the child in, and therefore goes back inside. But before the door closes, the baby, who is a boy, climbs out of the basket and enters the place. To his surprise, Oswald finds the baby boy indoors. He then goes on walking around, wondering what he should do. But when the child clings onto his leg and asks to be accepted, Oswald changes his mind. As it gets late that night, Oswald goes to sleep, sharing his bed with his new little brother figure. The baby boy, however, isn't sleepy and decides to have a little tour of the museum. While wandering the museum's hallways, the baby boy finds part of his pajamas opened. He then asks some statues to close it for him. After one of them provides assistance, that statue decides to show the little sightseer around. Thus all the other wax characters in the area come to life and go into a celebration by singing and dancing. It is a beautiful experience. The baby boy walks further in the museum and into another section. Unlike the ones he met previously, however, the statues there are hideous and hostile. They want nothing more than to torment anyone who steps into their abode. To defend himself, the baby boy grabs a blow torch, liquefying some of the wax monsters. Despite the child's advantage, the wax monsters are able to get close enough and take his weapon away. They then force their victim onto a platform and begin to pour molten wax on him. Back in the bedroom, Oswald hears the baby boy's cries for help, and makes the run. But by the time the rabbit reaches the location, it is too late, and all that's left on the platform is a wax relic in the shape of an infant. Oswald is then caught by the wax monsters to suffer a similar fate. It turns out all that trouble was in Oswald's dream. Finally waking up in his bed, Oswald is relieved to see the baby boy completely unscathed. He is then asked by the child to button the rear part of the latter's jammies.

The film tells the events that led to the tragic end of Giacomo Matteotti and to the establishment of the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini in Italy. It was awarded with the Special Jury Prize at the 8th Moscow International Film Festival.  Plot In Rome, on 30 May 1924, the Honorable Giacomo Matteotti, secretary of the Unitarian Socialist Party, in a courageous and engaging speech, asked that the elections of 6 April 1924 be canceled, contesting their validity. The politician claims, in fact, that the government majority list was only nominally supported by more than 4 million votes, but did not obtain the votes in fact and freely: the voters, due to the illegality, the retaliation and the violence suffered they gave the National Fascist Party their assent. These words immediately arouse reactions in the press and in public opinion and the fear of popular uprisings is also unleashed within the government. Nothing prevents the mysterious kidnapping of the deputy on 10 June. Public opinion is upset by this, the political opposition coagulates and decides to boycott the work of Parliament. It is difficult to start investigations for the discovery of Matteotti, but the media and public pressure forces Benito Mussolini to make decisions.

Accusation  In 2005, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents established a front company, Mercury Global Enterprises (MGE). A business acquaintance of Tappin contacted the company initially to buy surveillance equipment. They later enquired about exporting other military hardware without the proper licenses. Shortly before the man was arrested for trying to buy zinc/silver oxide batteries to power MIM-23 Hawk surface-to-air missiles for a customer in Tehran, Tappin was named as an exporter. US federal authorities allege Tappin tried to buy 50 Eagle- Picher P/N GAP 4328 zinc/silver oxide batteries (National Stock Number: 1420-00-484-8556) between December 2005 and January 2007. The batteries, which were to be exported from the United States to Iran via the Netherlands, are part of the electronics of the Hawk surface-to-air missile. In November 1985, 18 Hawk missiles were shipped to Iran during the Reagan Administration. Tappin maintains as the exporter he thought he was buying car batteries. The US maintains that the batteries were to be exported to Tehran without the necessary US government approval.  Arrest and extradition to the United States A federal arrest warrant for Tappin was first issued by a grand jury in Texas in 2007. In January 2012 Tappin lost his final appeal against extradition to the US under the Extradition Act 2003. On denying Tappin's appeal against extradition to the United States, Mr Justice Cranston, a judge of the High Court of England and Wales, considered whether the case was the result of entrapment by US agents, concluding: > Gibson, [Tappin]‚Äôs co-conspirator, approached MGE officers, not the other > way around, and said that he had already conducted illegal export activities > with [Tappin]. After Gibson dropped out, [Tappin] pursued the order and made > clear that ultimately he wanted 35 batteries. [Tappin] devised the cover > that the batteries were for electroplating by a Dutch chemical company. > MGE‚Äôs agents gave [Tappin] an opportunity to withdraw from the transaction > on 19 October [2006], after he had stopped payment, but [Tappin] persisted. Tappin's alleged co-conspirators were Robert Frederick Gibson (a British citizen) who pleaded guilty in 2007 and was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment, and Robert Thomas Caldwell (a US citizen) who was convicted at trial in 2007 and sentenced to one year and eight months imprisonment. On 24 February 2012, Tappin surrendered himself to British authorities at Heathrow Airport Police Station, London. Shortly afterwards he was handed over to US Marshals to be flown to the United States. His UK-based solicitor, Karen Todner, said that due to the difficulty in getting witnesses from the UK to testify in the US, and other difficulties in mounting a defence, it was likely that Tappin would make some form of plea bargain with American prosecutors. A few minutes before entering Heathrow Airport Police Station, Tappin spoke with news reporters, stating that: > I look to Mr Cameron to look after my rights and he has failed to do so. I > have no rights. Abu Qatada is walking the streets of London today and we > cannot extradite him. He has more rights than I have. If I was a terrorist I > would not be going to America. I think it‚Äôs a shame, a disgrace. The > Conservative government, while in opposition, promised to reform the law and > they failed to do so and they‚Äôve let me down, they‚Äôve let you down, they‚Äôve > let the whole country down. Tappin was flown to El Paso, Texas via Houston on United Airlines flights and incarcerated in Otero County jail in New Mexico before his first court hearing. At his own request, he was held in isolation.BBC News website https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17174702 He appeared in court on 29 February wearing an orange-colored prison jumpsuit, handcuffed and in shackles. Tappin was remanded in custody until 2 March. On 28 February, Elaine Tappin (his wife) addressed MPs on the Commons home affairs committee to express her dismay that UK courts were not interested in her husband's case. She stated that she was astonished that what she described as a \\"preposterous request\\" from US officials could be taken seriously by British courts. On 5 March, Judge Robert Castaneda ruled that Tappin must remain in custody after prosecutors asked that he be detained for the duration of the proceedings because he \\"posed a flight risk\\". Assistant US attorney Greg McDonald told the court that \\"the risk is not that he'll punch somebody in the face, but through the use of a computer and the knowledge he has, he might pose a danger to the community.\\" On 8 March, Karen Todner (Tappin's solicitor in the UK) urged the British government to intervene over the bail refusal. Eventually, on 25 April 2012, Tappin was bailed on condition that he wore an electronic tracking tag at all times. Additionally, his ability to travel was restricted to within two Texas counties as well as the border city of El Paso for court appearances. After being released on bail, Tappin told the BBC that he planned to vigorously defend himself against the allegations, stating that: > I'm not a terrorist. I've never had any connections with terrorism and I'm > just appalled that things could come to this sort of stage - especially in > my life now, when I'm 65, been retired for four years and enjoying > retirement. I didn't know these batteries were for Hawk missiles and too, I > didn't know they were destined for Iran.  Extradition controversy  Tappin's removal to the United States to stand trial has been criticised by the Leader of the UK Independence Party, Nigel Farage MEP, who sent an open letter to Theresa May about the issue and also set up an ePetition for opponents of Tappin's extradition to sign. The ePetition states: \\"In the light of the Chris Tappin case, demands that David Cameron debates the US-UK extradition treaty with President Obama, with a view to amending it\\". The requested debate did take place on 14 March 2012 but it remains to be seen whether it will produce any results. Isabella Sankey, the director of policy for Liberty, said: \\"No British court has ever been allowed to examine any evidence against Christopher Tappin or consider whether he should be tried here. Even if a US jury eventually finds him not guilty, he'll still spend years in a Texan jail awaiting trial, thousands of miles from his home and sick wife.\\" Conviction and sentencing On 1 November 2012, Tappin pleaded guilty in a federal court at El Paso, Texas, to selling weapons parts to Iran after reaching an agreement with prosecutors. Prosecutors said they would raise no objection to his serving the sentence in the UK. On 9 January 2013, Tappin was given a 33-month prison sentence for arms dealing and fined US$11,357 (¬£7,095). Between 8 March to 30 September 2013 he served his sentence at Federal Correctional Complex, Allenwood in Pennsylvania (as Federal Bureau of Prisons prisoner #90763-280) until his repatriation to HM Wandsworth.  Return to the UK  On 28 September 2013, Tappin returned to the UK on a chartered flight from New York City, to serve his remaining 14-month sentence at the HM Wandsworth prison in South London. He was subsequently paroled from prison in May 2014, on condition that he wore an electronic monitoring tag on his ankle.  Personal life  Tappin's wife of over 30 years, for whom he is the principal caregiver, suffers from chronic Churg-Strauss syndrome.

Paola's son is called Chicco, and he is a little boy who lives in an institution for minors where his mother goes to visit him. Meanwhile, Eugenio steals from the offer boxes in the church to go to the disco. However, he is beaten and robbed in the bathroom of the room by the accomplices of a girl who had pretended to want to go away with him. One evening the boy goes to the Caritas canteen and there he meets Paola, who asks him if he knows a place to sleep. Eugenio takes her to the train station, in a wagon in storage where he usually spends the night. There the two make love. The next morning they say goodbye by making an appointment for the evening at the canteen. Eugenio seeks work from an acquaintance, who throws him in a bad way, so he decides to contact the priest of the church where he was going to steal. The man offers him to lend a hand to a gentleman who gets by, by picking up the cardboard: Eugenio accepts. In the evening he goes to Caritas, waits until closing time but Paola does not arrive. Then he goes disconsolately to the station, where he meets her. He decides to take her to a seized building he had noticed in the afternoon. He hopes that he has found a better place to live with the girl. Their bond seems to be strengthening, but Paola is frightened at the idea of having her son taken away from her, and one day, returning home, Eugenio discovers that she is gone. He goes out and meets a friend who invites him for a drink in a bar. Later, completely drunk, he goes to the station and collapses on a sidewalk. Upon awakening he realizes that his shoes have been stolen and returns to the apartment. Here he finds Paola who shows him little Chicco and tells him how, by chance, she managed to take him away from the institute. Eugenio soon realizes that by staying in the apartment they would be discovered, so he steals a car to go, with what he now considers his family, to a friend who is a carousel in Puglia who can have them boarded illegally for Greece. Arriving at his destination, having to obtain the money necessary for the trip, his friend and two of his accomplices get involved in a robbery at a supermarket. The shot seems to have landed without being injured, despite a shooting. Eugenio, Paola and Chicco leave for Brindisi, where a man is waiting for them to hide them in a truck to be loaded on their way to Patras. Along the way - however - it turns out that Eugenio was injured in the robbery, but refuses to be taken to the hospital. Having reached their destination, the young man, exhausted, asks the girl to stop the car. He takes a few steps and collapses in agony at the foot of a tree. Here he hands the money to Paola and tells her who to contact when she arrives at the freight yard, so she dies. Paola and Chicco manage to embark.

Painting Born the year the civil war started in Lebanon, Ayman Baalbaki draws most of his inspiration from these events. His paintings often depict destroyed buildings, sometimes occupied by refugees who were forced to leave their homes during the combats. After the 2006 Lebanon War he drew series of scattered structures related to the demolitions consecutive to the bombings of Beirut's southern suburbs. Ayman Baalbaki's most popular series depict warriors bearing veils or casks. These portraits of anonymous figures became a symbol of the endless conflicts in the Middle East. These paintings have been widely exhibited worldwide, including the 2011 Venice Biennale. In 2012, Baalbaki participated in Hoods for Heritage, a project consisting of 16 Porsche 911 hoods transformed into art works by artists and designer and auctioned on benefit of the Beirut National Museum.

Silver Spring, Md: K & S Distributors [u.a.], 1998. p. 245 The goal of Imaledih was to mobilize support for the National Democratic Revolution Programme and to build a new party. The Imaledih programme called for the construction of a people's army, politicizing the population, increasing party membership, raising the political level of party cadres and integration of oppressed nationalities in government and party structures.Shinn, David H., and Thomas P. Ofcansky. Historical Dictionary of Ethiopia. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2004. p. 337 The formation of Imaledih followed the breakout of the Ethio-Somali war.

The Derg began seeking other ways to form a vanguard party. However, even as of September 1978 President Mengistu still maintained the position that the new party would emerge from Imaledih. In his Revolution Day speech he argued that 'the foremost slogan of the day is \\"Let the Common Front of Ethiopian Marxist-Leninist Organizations evolve into merger!\\"' Mengistu's position on Imaledih changed soon thereafter, as claims were made that Waz League had infiltrated Seded and come to occupy leading posts in Seded.Clapham Christopher.

It was part of the former conglomerate Hugo Stinnes GmbH. History Hugo Stinnes GmbH and the Ozean-Linie In 1808, Mathias Stinnes founded a company for shipping and coal trading, the activities focused on the rivers Rhine and Ruhr. Mathias Stinnes‚Äô grandson Hugo Stinnes founded the company ‚ÄúHugo Stinnes GmbH‚Äù in 1907 with the purpose of coastal coal trade, marine cargo handling and shipping. In 1917, Hugo Stinnes founded the Stock Corporation for Maritime Shipping and Overseas Trade in Hamburg, containing among others the companies of Mathias Stinnes and Hugo Stinnes. Ever since, this company was the corporate center for all of Stinnes‚Äô interests in shipping and overseas trade. After a failed attempt to gain influence in the established shipping companies by acquisition of shares, Hugo Stinnes entered in 1920 into direct competition with the three main shipping companies HAPAG, Norddeutscher Lloyd and Hamburg Sued. In 1921, Stinnes took share in the Ozean-Linie, founded in 1908 by the H. Schuldt group of shipping companies. The Ozean-Linie operated a liner service between the Continent and Cuba/Mexico. Until the death of Hugo Stinnes in 1924, more than 30 ships sailed - in co-operation with smaller shipping companies - under Stinnes flag mainly to Central- and South America and to East Asia. Hugo Stinnes Corporation The Hugo Stinnes Corporation was founded in 1926 in order to raise American capital. Most of the Stinnes family‚Äôs considerable assets were ceded to this company. In 1941, the Stinnes family‚Äôs share in the Hugo Stinnes Corporation was considered enemy capital and confiscated by the U.S.A. The Hugo Stinnes Corporation was auctioned and continued business in New York under the name of Hugo Stinnes Industries Inc. Kept out of Hugo Stinnes Industries due to American restrictions, the Stinnes family got into business for themselves in 1948. In 1950, Cl√§re Stinnes, widow of the founder Hugo Stinnes, and the sons Hugo and Otto Stinnes founded the ‚ÄúHugo Stinnes Fuel,- Iron- and Shipping Company, branch office Duisburg- Ruhrort‚Äù. Soon, Otto Stinnes relocated to Hamburg and assumed the management of the Stinnes fleet under the company name Hugo Stinnes, branch office Hamburg. Hugo Stinnes Schiffahrt GmbH In 1989, the Iron Curtain fell and the GDR (East Germany) collapsed. East and West Germany re-united (October 1990). The Volkseigene Betriebe (\\"People-owned enterprises\\") were privatized. In 1992, KG Monsun (a fully owned subsidiary of Hugo Stinnes, branch office Hamburg) and 'Deutsche Seereederei Rostock GmbH' founded the shipping company ‚ÄúDSR Stinnes West Indies Services GmbH‚Äù, domiciled in Hamburg. The company name was changed into ‚ÄúH. Stinnes Linien GmbH‚Äù in 1998. Deutsche Seereederei acquired the remaining shares from the Stinnes family in 2002 and moved the company‚Äôs headquarters from Hamburg to Rostock. By means of a buy-out, Deutsche Seereederei sold the activities of ‚ÄúHugo Stinnes Linien GmbH‚Äù in 2008 to ‚ÄúStinnes Holding GmbH‚Äù, a company founded by Mr. Jens Kroczek. This company continues the shipping activities to date under the name ‚ÄúHugo Stinnes Schiffahrt GmbH‚Äù. Although no longer in possession of the Stinnes family since more than a decade, ‚ÄúHugo Stinnes Schiffahrt GmbH‚Äù is nowadays the only company bearing the name Stinnes and operating in one of the three original fields of activity of the Stinnes conglomerate (coal mining, metallurgical industry, shipping). Besides operating a full container service from and to South Africa, the Rostock domiciled ‚ÄúHugo Stinnes Schiffahrt GmbH‚Äù is a specialist for the ocean transport of breakbulk-, heavy load- and project cargo between Northern Europe, the Caribbean and Mexico, thus continuing the tradition of Ozean-Linie from 1921.

It is native to Mexico and the southwestern United States from Arizona to Texas.Matthews, Robin F. 1994. Lycium berlandieri. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. This shrub reaches up to tall. The roots may extend from the plant. It has spiny branches. It loses its leaves and becomes dormant during dry times. The bell-shaped flowers are solitary or borne in pairs. The fruit is a juicy red berry. This plant's life span is 90 years on average. This plant is characteristic of the flora of the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts. It is rarely dominant, but it occurs in many types of desert habitat, including mesquite and saltbush plant communities, creosote, grassland, prairie, and savanna. It can grow in desert salt flats and other saline habitats. It may invade grassland along with mesquite during the process of ecological succession. In the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts it grows alongside ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens), saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea), range ratany (Krameria parvifolia), ironwood (Olneya tesota), jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis), false-mesquite (Calliandra eriophylla), brittlebush (Encelia farinosa), leatherstem (Jatropha cardiophylla), feather dalea (Dalea formosa), yucca, agave, Opuntia cacti, and acacia species. In Texas it can be found in sandy arroyos and more saline areas alongside mesquite and hackberry. Many birds and rodents consume the fruits of the shrub. Gambel's quail live in habitat where the shrub is common, and they use it for cover and nesting. Native Americans consumed the fruits and used the plant medicinally.

Pre BMW era 9X (1967 to 1979) Mini 9X at the Heritage Motor Centre From 1967 to 1979, Alec Issigonis worked on designing a replacement for the Mini in the form of an experimental model called the 9X. Due to politicking inside British Leyland (which had now been formed by the merger of BMC's parent company British Motor Holdings and the Leyland Motor Corporation), the car never reached production. The 9X addressed many of the engineering flaws in Issigonis' original design- namely its complexity, its harsh ride and its poor mechanical refinement caused by the gearbox-in-sump layout. The final fully engineered prototype had a shorter wheelbase than the Mini but was three inches shorter overall. It was also slightly wider and offered significantly more interior space plus a hatchback body. The separate subframes of the Mini were removed and the body frame construction greatly simplified- the 9X required less than half the number of individual parts to build than a Mini. The power unit was an all-new four-cylinder design with a belt-driven overhead camshaft. The crankcase and cylinder head were made from aluminium alloy while the block was of cast iron, with all three sections being held together by long through-bolts. This was identical construction to the original Austin Seven's engine and similar ideas would be revisited in the 1980s for the Rover K-Series engine. Capacity in the prototype was 1000cc with versions as low as 750cc possible, as well as six- cylinder versions which would still be compact enough to install transversely. Power output was 60 horsepower per litre (as opposed to around 40 hp/litre for the existing A-Series engine) and the new engine was also significantly lighter. To reduce maintenance and the number of parts the engine's alternator was incorporated into the flywheel (a common practice on motorcycles). The gearbox was mounted behind and below the engine in a separate casing, rather than sharing the engine's sump oil. This reduced noise levels caused by the Mini's transmission transfer gears and allowed better control of drivetrain shunt and vibration. The Hydrolastic suspension system developed by Alex Moulton was rejected in favour of a more conventional system with MacPherson struts at the front and a torsion beam axle at the back. This reduced production costs, potentially reduced warranty claim rates and allowed a more comfortable ride. The 9X was, in essence, identical to later European superminis such as the Fiat 127, the Peugeot 104, the Renault 5 and the Volkswagen Polo, but was conceived several years before the first of these cars was launched. Issigonis also drew up plans for a larger five-door 9X on a 90-inch (2286mm) wheelbase against the three-door 81-inch (2057mm) wheelbase of the built prototype. This enlarged version shared many structural, suspension and drivetrain parts with the 'Mini-sized' 9X and was Issigonis' proposal to succeed his own ADO16 design. Project Ant - the Barrel Mini (1968) Project Ant ran parallel to Issigonis 9X and was a plan to keep the same space efficiency but be cheaper to manufacturer, less complex and cut down on labour hours.. The project was cancelled in 1968. Mini Clubman (1967-68) In 1967 Roy Haynes joined BMC from Ford Motor Company and was tasked by then Managing Director, Joe Edwards to update the existing Mini. Several designs were looked at including a booted version based upon the Riley / Wolsley Elf/Hornet and a hatchback with a rear end resembling a Morris Marina, which was also designed by Haynes. All of these were rejected except for the new front which was added to the existing Mini and named the Clubman. Pininfarina Mini In 1967 and 1968, Pininfarina designed two concept cars that were based on the BMC 1800 and 1100 models. These aerodynamic models were rejected by BMC, however there is evidence that BMC did a study to look at a mini version of this car without Pininfarina's assistance. ADO74 In 1972 British Leyland began considering a replacement for the then 13-year-old Mini. With the cancellation of the 9X under BMC the small car market had been left to the growing band of superminis which, as the 9X had done, took the Mini concept and improved on it. The main improvement was from the realisation that the Mini's incredibly small size was not entirely necessary. Superminis were still much smaller than the usual small family car but were slightly larger than the Mini, which led to significantly more useful interior space without the need for the compromises in seating position, drivetrain refinement and low equipment levels that the Mini used to create its spacious but small interior. The Italian engineer Dante Giacosa had long been Issigonis' main rival when it came to mastery of small car design and his transverse (but no gearbox-in-sump) engine layout and the addition of a hatchback (both ideas that Issigonis had himself seen as a way of improving the Mini on the 9X) provided the template for the new generation of superminis. British Leyland now had to catch up with the market. The ADO74 project considered various proposed car sizes, from a direct Mini replacement, a more conventional supermini and a compact saloon. Unsurprisingly the mid-sized option was chosen and styling proposals were drawn up by Harris Mann and Giovanni Michelotti, with Mann's design going forward. The result was over 15 inches longer than the Mini, with a wheelbase 10 inches longer. Like the 9X (and most of its would-be competitors) the ADO74 used MacPherson strut front suspension, but with independent trailing arms at the rear, akin to the contemporary Honda Civic. Power would have come from the proposed K-Series engine (an alloy-head overhead cam version of the Mini's A-Series engine that owed much to the 9X's prototype unit). The ADO74 project progressed slowly - partly due to continuing corporate problems at BL and partly due to the need for numerous design changes requested by the firm's overseas sales division, Leyland International, which took the view that the ADO74 was too conventional and that it would be better to create another innovative car rather than compete directly with the established competition. The supermini market moved quickly in the early 'Seventies and the ADO74 underwent several redesigned to keep abreast of these changes in order that it wouldn't be outdated as soon as it was released. Eventually these changes became so significant that BL realized that it would be better to start from scratch. The ADO74 project was cancelled in 1973 and the ADO88 project took its place. ADO88 This was a 'clean sheet' design using all the knowledge gained from the cancelled ADO74 proposal, with Charles 'Spen' King in overall charge. The new car was sized to be smaller than the established superminis but larger than a Mini to allow useful improvements in refinement, practicality and safety that the market demanded. With the Mini's superb interior space for its size still one of the ageing model's key selling points the brief for ADO88 was that the car had to offer the same usable cabin volume as the competition but in a car with smaller external dimensions. Budget restrictions meant that there would be no new power units for the ADO88, which would instead use the familiar A-Series units from the Mini, along with the old car's gearbox-in-sump transmission. Tests showed that despite its age the engine could still deliver highly competitive fuel economy so it was modernised and updated to create the A-Plus generation. The conventional suspension of the 9X and the ADO74, and the Mini's solid rubber cone springs, were replaced by the Hydragas system recently debuted on the Austin Allegro which offered a useful improvement in ride quality as well as being much more compact than a standard steel spring and damper setup, which was crucial to provide the car with the required interior space. That requirement also led to the ADO88, despite the efforts of Harris Mann. having an inevitably boxy appearance, with an almost vertical rear hatch (similar in appearance to the later Fiat Cinquecento). This style was received very poorly in customer clinics and the project was renamed LC8 with the aim of providing a more upmarket style and appearance to make the car more competitive. Having originally been intended as a complete Mini replacement, LC8 would now become a separate car in its own right to replace the higher-end Clubman and 1275GT Mini models while the more basic Minis would continue (with some of the improvements from the ADO88 project such as the A-Plus engine and front disc brakes) as a budget model. The LC8 became the Austin Metro, which was initially launched in 1980 as the Austin Mini-Metro to signify its status as a supplement to the Mini range rather than a replacement. 1994 to present Mini Spiritual and Spiritual Too (1997) At the 1997 Geneva Motor Show, BMW and Rover revealed two Mini concepts called the Spiritual and Spiritual Too. Compared to the ACV30, it showed a potential non-retro design for the forthcoming new Mini, which was designed by Oliver Le Grice. The cars were compact and clever, featuring a rear-engined 60 hp 800 cc 3-cylinder version of the K-Series engine Autocar Magazine - 5 March 1997 as well as the latest version of Alex Moulton's Hydragas suspension system to maximise interior space; this was claimed to be more of the heart of the mini instead of retro. Mini ACV30 (1997) Rover first showed its ideas for a modern Mini in the form of the ACV30 concept car in 1997 created to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Mini's win at the 1967 Monte Carlo Rally with ACV standing for Anniversary Concept Vehicle. Based on the mid-engined, rear wheel drive MG F, the ACV30 featured several elements that influenced the eventual new Mini of 2001 such as the black a-pillars, chunky wheel arch detailing and white roof. The concept was attributed to the BMW designer Adrian van Hooydonk and Frank Stephenson, but the research work began at the end of 1995, with a collaboration with the Transportation design course of the IED in Turinhttps://www.ied.it/. In particular, the project of the Sicilian designer Salvatore Catalano was acquired in July 1996 by Rover and chosen for the development of the concept and some ideas found application in the development of the Mini which subsequently went into production. 2000 Paris Motor Show Before the first sales of the new generation Mini in 2001, prototype versions were shown at the 2000 Paris Motor Show. These were essentially identical to the version that was finally sold except that the colours used ('Candy Blue' and 'Flamenco Orange') have never been used in production. Mini Hydrogen concept (2001) Mini showcased a hydrogen-powered concept car in 2001 at the Frankfurt Auto Show. The car differs from electric-motor hydrogen concepts, such as the Honda FCX in that it uses a cylinder-based internal combustion engine based on the existing 1.6-litre petrol Mini. Mini Traveller (2005) Mini Traveller concept car at the 2006 Detroit Auto Show At the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show Mini revealed a retro version of the classic \\"Mini Traveller\\" estate car. The Traveller concept had a stretched wheelbase, two side-hinged rear doors, and separate rear seats replacing the split bench seat of the standard Mini. At the Tokyo Auto Show, the same basic concept reappeared with some fanciful additions ‚Äî a circular roof section that could be removed to form a picnic table with four folding chairs. The rear side windows were replaced with fold-down storage containers containing cutlery, cups and plates. A further version was presented at the Detroit without the table and chairs but with a radically restyled interior. Ultimately, a production version of the Traveller concept vehicle appeared during the 2008 model year as the Mini Clubman. Mini Crossover (2008) The Mini Crossover Concept was unveiled in 2008 at the Paris Motor Show. It was over long, with four-wheel drive, wide tyres, and a single piece rear door with a retractable rear window. Inside, it had a large glass ball in the centre of the instrument panel, called the 'Mini Centre Globe'; this system incorporated laser projection technology for 3D navigational routes and films. A production vehicle based on the Crossover Concept was launched in 2010 as the Mini Countryman. Mini Coup√© (2009) The Mini Coup√© concept vehicle was unveiled in 2009 at the Frankfurt Motor Show. It had a 2-seat coup√© body, and incorporated the engine from the Mini John Cooper Works, and the chrome radiator grille from the Cooper S (but with the inner sections of the grille finished in the body colour). It had a luggage capacity of 250 litres. BMW subsequently announced that the Mini Coup√© would go into production, with assembly to take place in Oxford. Mini Beachcomber (2009) Mini Beachcomber at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. On 16 December 2009, Mini revealed the Beachcomber Concept, which drew heavily on the Moke styling while still being packed with modern equipment. The Beachcomber Concept was based on the forthcoming Countryman all-wheel drive platform, and made its public debut at the Detroit Auto Show in January 2010. Mini Paceman (2011) The three- door Paceman concept was announced in January 2011 at the Detroit Auto Show, Mini's 10th anniversary in the US market. Designed by Gert Hildebrand, it was based on the recently launched Countryman, with a similar interior, and range of options and drivetrains, including the ALL4 permanent all-wheel drive system. From the screen rearwards, the Paceman features an entirely new exterior borrowing design features of the 2009 Mini Coupe Concept and is 4110mm long. The concept car was shown with the most powerful engine in the Mini range: the John Cooper Works 1.6-litre twin-scroll turbocharged engine, with 211 hp and maximum torque of 260 Nm, with an overboost maximum of 280 Nm. Production was mooted to commence in 2012, and Mini's marketing materials referred to it as the first \\"Sports Activity Coupe\\". Mini Rocketman (2011) Mini Rocketman at Geneva 2011 Geneva Motor Show. The Mini Rocketman concept was first shown to the public at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show. It is a smaller three-door hatchback, about a foot shorter than the Mini Hatch. The Rocketman features a panoramic glass roof etched with the Union Flag. It is not much bigger than the original Mini, has an unusual cantilevered door design and a carbon spaceframe construction. The Rocketman was promoted as being economical with a fuel consumption of , on average. Yahoo! described the Rocketman as 'the weirdest concept Mini yet'. It was expected that the concept car would reach production, but in early 2012 it was confirmed that the car would remain a concept only. Mini Clubvan (2012) The Mini Clubvan was shown for the first time at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show. Based on the existing Mini Clubman, it is the first time Mini made a light commercial van in 30 years since the demise of the original Mini Van in 1982. Mini Vision (2013) The Mini Vision was first shown in Germany in July 2013, and anticipated the design evolution of the forthcoming 2014 Mini. Mini Clubman (2014) Mini Clubman concept at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show The Mini Clubman concept is the longest and widest car designed by Mini, bigger than the production Countryman. It was unveiled at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show, and is considered to anticipate the design of the future Clubman model. Vision GT In June 2014, it was announced that Mini would be creating a new concept car for the video game Gran Turismo 6.http://www.gran- turismo.com/sg/products/gt6/vgt/http://www.gtplanet.net/mini-joins-vision- gran-turismo-project-for-gt6/ Electric Concept  Electric Concept during presentation in Frankfurt The Electric Concept was presented during IAA 2017 in Frankfurt.

He studied at the Paris-Sorbonne University. He is the director of the School of Visual Arts at Acad√©mie Libanaise des Beaux- Arts ALBA and was co founder, with architects Pierre Hage Boutros and Rana Haddad, of Atelier de Recherche ALBA. From 2012 to 2019, Buchakjian has been a member of the advisory committee of the Saradar Collection, devoted to Lebanese art from the contemporary and modern periods. Work Buchakjian emerged in the art scene after the 2006 Lebanon War within a collective of Lebanese filmmakers. He directed What Shoes, a short animation film presented as part of the Videos Under Siege project featured in the Dubai International Film Festival 2008. In the following years, he slipped into Beirut's vibrant and underground nightlife. His photographs depict sensuality although violence and anxiety remain hidden. Taking its name \\"Nighthawks\\" from a famous painting by Edward Hopper, the project was exhibited in Der Aa-kerk, Groningen as part of the 18th Noorderlicht Photofestival 2011: Metropolis. In the aftermath, Buchakjian produced a scholarly study on the history of nightlife photography in Lebanon. Buchakjian was part of The Place that Remains, the first national Pavilion of Lebanon curated by Hala Younes at the 2018 Venice Biennale of Architecture. After the eruption of the 2019‚Äì2020 Lebanese protests, he collected screenshots of photographs, videos, drawings and texts published on social media. The first 480 in order of appearance were gathered in the work Thawra Stories followed by the list of the instagram accounts where they were released. Abandoned dwellings From 2009 to 2016, Buchakjian constituted a long-term research and exploration devoted to abandoned dwellings in Beirut that involved a PhD dissertation. In this context, he collaborated with Said Baalbaki on a lithography artist book based on Wadi Abu Jamil, the former Jewish Quarter of Beirut, where Baalbaki grew up, that was witnessed dramatic transformations during the war and postwar periods. He also exhibited, in dialogue with Fran√ßois Sargologo, photographic ruins extracted from a building that was allegedly inhabited by a member of the General Command of ‚ÄúAl Assifa‚Äù forces within the Palestine Liberation Organization. The artistic project was disclosed in 2018 with an exhibition curated by Karina El Helou at Beirut's Sursock Museum. It included staged photographs of human figures wandering in the ruins, an apparatus displaying data sheets for 700 buildings and a video in which Buchakjian and Valerie Cachard manipulate, examine and read extracts from hundreds of documents they collected during their visits. In the second installment at Brussel‚Äôs Villa Empain, one entire room was exclusively about the house of former prime minister Takieddin el-Solh, with drawings made after objects found on the grounds and two pictures of the same space, one by Buchakjian and one taken in 1984 by Fouad Elkoury.

Names It is known as sataw in the Kalam language of Papua New Guinea.Bulmer, RNH (1975). Kalam Classification Of Reptiles And Fishes. Journal of the Polynesian Society 84(3): 267‚Äì308.  Distribution  Micropechis ikaheca is endemic to New Guinea and adjacent islands, notably Karkar Island, Madang Province, in Papua New Guinea, where it is particularly common and referred to as the \\"white snake\\" due to its pale coloring. It is also found on neighboring Manam Island, and Walis Island in East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea, and on the Schouten Islands, Papua Province, and Raja Ampat Islands, West Papua Province, West New Guinea. It is also reported from the Aru Islands.  Taxonomy  Two subspecies have been proposed. The nominate form, M. ikaheca ikaheca as described by Lesson, and which occurs on the Vogelkop, and the islands of Misool and Salawati in the Raja Ampat Archipelago, has very little banding on its pale yellow to brown body. M. ikaheca fasciatus, the banded form, described by German herpetologist and ichthyologist, Johann Gustav Fischer in 1884, is found throughout the rest of New Guinea. Specimens from southern Western New Guinea are strongly banded throughout, but most of the specimens from the remainder of New Guinea, including the Schouten Islands, lack banding on the anterior section of the body. Specimens of M. ikaheca from Waigeo and Batanta, in the Raja Ambat Islands, are virtually black, without any patterning.  Natural history  M. ikaheca is a thick-bodied, smooth-scaled snake that grows up to long. It has small eyes that are typical of other semi-fossorial burrowing snakes, and is either nocturnal or crepuscular. In common with most other elapids, M. ikaheca is oviparous. The name ikaheca means \\"land eel\\" in a local West Papuan dialect, indicating the snake's preference for damp or semi-aquatic habitats, such as swamps, creeks, wetlands, low-lying rainforest, and piles of discarded vegetation debris, i.e. oil palm windrows, and coconut palm husk piles. It may be encountered crossing roads following rain at night M. ikaheka hunts small vertebrates, including small rodents and bandicoots, ground-dwelling lizards such as skinks, and snakes, such as the New Guinea ground boa Candoia aspera.O‚ÄôShea, M. 1994 Micropechis ikaheka (Small-eyed or Ikaheka Snake) Ophiophagy. Herpetological Review 25(2):70. It is also cannibalistic.O‚ÄôShea, M. 1994 Micropechis ikaheka (Small-eyed or Ikaheka Snake) Cannibalism. Herpetological Review 25(2):70-71.  Venom  M. ikaheca is considered a dangerous species, having been implicated in numerous fatal bites on humans. The first proven human fatality occurred in 1958 in Wau, Papua New Guinea, where a young man died 36 hours after being bitten on the base of the thumb while handling the snake. Another envenomation occurred when a villager reportedly killed a specimen, but was then bitten on the left thumb by the \\"dead\\" snake when showing it to his neighbors (this bite may be due to postmortem reflex action). The species has since been firmly established as a medically important species. Bites typically occur when plantation workers are moving coconut palm husk piles,O‚ÄôShea, M. 1994 The herpetofauna of coconut husk piles on Kar Kar Island, Madang Province, Papua New Guinea: The initial surveys. ASRA Journal 1994:51-72. where the snakes shelter during the day, cutting grass, walking on plantation tracks, or harvesting cocoa beans. Although normally shy, if disturbed (e.g., handled, stepped on) it may become highly aggressive, striking readily and rapidly. Bites are tenacious and chewing, and are not easily released. M. ikaheca is responsible for approximately 40% of all snake envenomations on Karkar Island, but less than 10% on the mainland, where the majority of snakebites are caused by the death adders. Symptoms typically include local muscle pain and tenderness, fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, dizziness, headache, hypotension, and spontaneous bleeding; severe envenomation may present neurotoxic and myotoxic symptoms such as ptosis, dysarthria, and trismus. Death may occur from respiratory paralysis. Although there is no specific antivenom therapy for M. ikaheka bites, CSL polyvalent antivenom has been found to be beneficial.

It runs from Ro√üwein through the Striegis valley to Hainichen and on to Frankenberg and Niederwiesa, where the line ends at a junction with the Dresden‚ÄìWerdau railway. Since 2004, only the 16.8 km long section between Niederwiesa and Hainichen is still operating.  History  In the spring of 1867 construction began on the railway line between Niederwiesa and Hainichen. On 1 March 1869, the Royal Saxon State Railways () opened the line as a branch of the main line between Chemnitz and Dresden. Initially, only about two to three trains ran daily. The Hainichen-Rosswein Railway Company (Hainichen- Rossweiner Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft), which had been founded in 1872, opened, on 15 August 1874, a new 17 km-long section from Hainichen to Ro√üwein to the Borsdorf‚ÄìCoswig railway of the Leipzig‚ÄìDresden Railway Company. It was taken over by the Royal Saxon State Railways on 10 August 1876, which had managed operations on it from its opening. Harras Tunnel on a postcard appr. in 1915 The Harass (or Harrassprung‚Äî\\"Haras‚Äô leap\\", referring to the legend of a leap on horseback off the rocks into the river said to have been made by Dietrich von Harras in 1449) tunnel runs through the Harass rocks (Harrasfelsen) between Braunsdorf and Frankenberg. It was the site of a serious railway accident on 14 December 1913. During a winter storm, about 100 m¬≥ of rock broke away from the Harass rocks and blocked the southern exit of the tunnel. Shortly after 22.15, a passenger train from Frankenberg to Niederwiesa ran into the debris. The accident claimed 10 dead and 53 wounded and is still regarded as the worst rail disaster in Saxony. Saxony cancelled passenger services between Ro√üwein and Hainichen on 24 May 1998. Freight traffic on this section was also closed on 1 January 2000. The Federal Railway Authority (Eisenbahn-Bundesamt) approved the closure of the Hainichen‚ÄìRo√üwein section on 11 July 2001 and it was completed on 30 September 2001. In August 2002, during the most severe flood in Saxony, bridges on this section were completely destroyed and parts of the track were washed away by the flow of the Striegis. The reconstruction and reopening of the line is therefore out of the question. In October 2002, the whole line was leased to Regio Infra Service Sachsen. After several years of renovation, the City-Bahn Chemnitz reopened the Niederwiesa‚ÄìHainichen section on 11 December 2004. As part of the renovation, the old Frankenberg (Sachs) S√ºd halt was abandoned and replaced by a newly established halt of the same name about 800 metres closer to the centre of Frankenberg, near the Auf dem Wind housing estate. Two services an hour run on the line on weekdays and on Saturdays and Sundays services run every two hours. Services are operated using a Regio-Shuttle diesel railcar.  Railtrail  Abandoned track at former Grunau station (May 2017) The lower section between Hainichen and Ro√üwein, however, remains unused. In 2005, it was abandoned by Regio Infra Service Sachsen and the city of Hainichen decided to dismantle the tracks in order to build a cycle path on the route.

It is a dense tangle of spiny spreading or erect branches. It can form bushy thickets. The leaves are pale, giving the plant its name.Lycium pallidum. International Institute of Tropical Forestry. The flowers are solitary or borne in pairs. They are funnel-shaped and \\"creamy- yellow to yellowish-green\\" or \\"greenish cream, sometimes tinged with purple\\". They are fragrant and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a juicy, oval- shaped, shiny red berry containing up to 50 seeds. The plant reproduces by seed and it can also spread via cuttings, and by suckering and layering. Ecology and habitat This plant grows in many types of desert habitat. It occurs in pinyon-juniper woodland, sagebrush, shrubsteppe, savanna, and other ecosystems. It can grow in high-salinity soils. It is characteristic of the flora of the Mojave Desert, and it also occurs in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts. In the Mojave Desert it grows alongside plants such as winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), Pima rhatany (Krameria erecta), spiny hopsage (Grayia spinosa), Shockley goldenhead (Acamptopappus shockleyi), Fr√©mont's dalea (Psorothamnus fremontii), spiny menodora (Menodora spinescens), and species of ephedra, prickly pear, and yucca. In Arizona it grows in riparian habitat with sycamore (Platanus wrightii), willows (Salix spp.), Arizona walnut (Juglans major), Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), alligator juniper (Juniperus deppeana), Arizona white oak (Quercus arizonica), and velvet ash (Fraxinus velutina). This plant is common around Anasazi ruins; they may have simply collected it and dropped the seeds, but it is possible they cultivated it. Many types of animals consume the fruits. Phainopepla especially favor it. Woodrats like the foliage. Uses Native Americans utilized the plant for a number of medicinal and other purposes. The Navajo used it for toothache. They considered it a sacred plant and sacrificed it to the gods. Several groups used the fruit for food by eating it fresh, cooked, or dried, eating it mixed with clay, boiling it into a syrup, and making it into beverages.Lycium pallidum.

Formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of Solar Entertainment Corporation (SEC), a multimedia television and film company of the Tieng family, it is now solely owned by the ALC Group of Companies of the late Amb. Antonio Cabangon Chua. Nine Media is currently an affiliate of Aliw Broadcasting Corporation. Its headquarters are located at the Ground Floor of the Worldwide Corporate Center, Epifanio de los Santos Avenue corner Shaw Boulevard, Mandaluyong City, sharing with its former parent Solar Entertainment. It owns and operates its sole television property CNN Philippines, as well as the 34% controlling share of Radio Philippines Network (RPN). The company is named after its flagship television station in Metro Manila. History TV channel Solar Entertainment launched Solar TV in the early 2000s, which was later renamed to Solar USA and then to USA. USA was split into two channels, Jack TV and Crime/Suspense, in 2005. Solar TV launched last November 29, 2009 on Radio Philippines Network (RPN), then owned by the Philippine Government Communications Group, at 11:00am (Solar Entertainment already has an airtime lease agreement with RPN in 2007). Its programming grid primarily includes American programs, and local sports and lifestyle content. On October 31, 2010, it changed some of its programming content to English/Tagalog. Broadcast company Solar TV morphed as Solar Television Network, Inc. (STVNI) on January 5, 2010 as the corporate television arm of Solar Entertainment Corporation, serving as blocktimer of Solar Entertainment's channels to free-to-air broadcasting networks. STVNI later represents Solar Entertainment to acquire 34% of RPN's shares from the Philippine government as part of RPN/IBC privatization in 2011. The new company launched an all talk/news channel Talk TV on March 2, 2011, co-owned by Solar TV itself and SBN while ETC replaced Solar TV on RPN. Talk TV would later change its name to Solar News Channel on October 30, 2012. In the last quarter of 2011, Solar TV launched its own news division Solar News. The programs produced by the new division were manned by former ANC personalities including Jing Magsaysay, Pia Hontiveros, Nancy Irlanda, Claire Celdran and Mai Rodriguez.Tiengs move into news Manila Standard Today. 02-25-2011. Retrieved 02-25-2011. In November 2013, San Miguel Corp. President and COO Ramon S. Ang personally tried to acquire the majority stake of STVNI from the Tiengs. Despite the new development, he would settle instead for a minority share of STVNI in September 2014. In the third quarter of 2014, Solar Entertainment chair Wilson Tieng announced that the ALC Group of Companies of former Ambassador Antonio Cabangon-Chua, took over STVNI, as well as its majority stake on RPN. Tieng and (RPN president) Robert Rivera were both resigned as chairman and president, respectively. The selloff of STVNI was also caused by Solar Entertainment's loss of revenue after investing in RPN.Cabangon-Chua acquires RPN-9 retrieved August 21, 2014Cabangon-Chua group set to take over RPN-9 retrieved August 21, 2014 Solar TV reflected the change of ownership by reverting all non-SNC channels and assets back to Solar Entertainment, followed by shedding off the Solar branding in all SNC's programs. The transfer was completed when SNC (which was transferred to RPN in December 2013) was finally rebranded into 9TV on August 23, 2014.\\\\- Solar News to be renamed News9? (Media Newser Philippines) retrieved August 18, 2014\\\\- Is RPN-9 Destined to Return? retrieved August 18, 2014 On October 14, 2014, Solar TV Network was renamed as Nine Media Corporation, following the agreement between the latter and the Turner Broadcasting System to use the branding of CNN into its free TV assets of RPN as CNN Philippines, replacing 9TV, which was considered as a transitional brand. CNN Philippines was launched on March 16, 2015. In September 2015, Nine Media Corporation President and CEO Reggie Galura stepped down from his position, and replaced by Jorge San Agustin as Officer in Charge of the network temporary. One year later on October 9, 2016, CNN Philippines Managing Editor Armie Jarin-Bennett was appointed as president and CEO of Nine Media Corporation replacing Jorge San Agustin. Corporate Structure As Solar TV Network Solar Entertainment Corp. (SEC) and Solar TV (STV), prior to the latter's acquisition by ALC Group of Companies in 2014, are two separate business entities: *SEC is exclusively owned by the Tieng brothers and operates 10 TV networks - ETC, 2nd Avenue, JackTV, JackCITY, Solar Sports, Basketball TV, NBA Premium, Shop TV, The Game Channel and My Movie Channel. It also has activities in film distribution. *STV, which presently runs Solar News Channel, is an incorporation wherein both William Tieng and Wilson Tieng are members of the Board of Directors. As Nine Media Since 2014, Nine Media Corporation is being owned by ALC Group of Companies through its investment unit JRLT-JHI Corporation. While Antonio Cabangon-Chua was sitted as its chairman until his passing in 2016, JRLT-JHI is being owned by his children and relatives: Ferdinand Chua (20%), Rowena Lumague (20%), Candy Co (20%), Jose Wingkee Jr (20%), and Aida Anora (20%).

He is a former member of the Rock bands, Liverpool Express, Fortune, Nina Hagen, Harlan Cage, and 101 South. Liverpool Express Roger with members of his band, Liverpool Express, 1976 Roger started his career with The Merseybeats in the early 1970s, along with members, Tony Crane, Derek Cashin, and Tony Coates. They later left \\"Tony Crane and The Merseybeats\\", to form a band called Liverpool Express. Roger invited to come with them, Billy Kinsley whom Roger saw performing in clubs at the time, and admired Billy's singing voice. Liverpool Express experienced chart success with \\"You Are My Love\\", a song mentioned by Paul McCartney as one of his favourite love songs, plus \\"Every Man Must Have A Dream\\", \\"Dreamin'\\", \\"Hold Tight\\", and \\"Smile\\". They toured the UK and Europe supporting Rod Stewart, and released more hit singles. Their greatest success came in South America where they scored two consecutive number one hits and they flew over there to tour Brazil in mid 1977. Arriving at Rio de Janeiro Airport, the band were greeted by thousands of hysterical fans. Meeting Prince Charles at The Royal Command Performance In early 1978, Prince Charles specifically requested that Liverpool Express perform for him at The Royal Gala Performance to be held at the Empire Theatre in Liverpool. The band were introduced to the Prince and photographed with him after the show. Fortune/Nina Hagen Roger left Liverpool behind in 1981 to settle in California, he says he was tired of the cold and rainy weather! He joined the band Fortune, after auditioning for several bands, including Foreigner. He wanted to be on the West Coast of the US which led to him taking the Fortune job; and they recorded one album in the mid-eighties. This album had all but one of the songs on it written by Roger S. Craig. This album has become something of a cult classic, all due to his songwriting abilities. After this period he joined Nina Hagen's band, and appeared on her album, In Ekstase. They toured Europe and South America and played to hundreds of thousands of people at the Rock in Rio concert in Brazil. Nina Hagen was not well known in the US, but was VERY popular in Europe. She went through various keyboard players when Roger quit her band, only to hire him again at a later date as no one else came up to her standards as a performer. Harlan Cage He, along with musician, Larry Greene, formed the band Harlan Cage in the mid- nineties, and they recorded and released successful albums right into the 2000s until a 'Best of' album was commissioned. Roger and Larry formed a very workable group, with Larry's strong and sensual vocals, Harlan Cage became a cult classic which vied with the previous Fortune album for supremacy in the Pomp AOR world. 101 South Roger later formed a new band, 101 South, in 2000 and they recorded three albums together. 101 South comprises the fulmination of the creativity from all the songs he wrote throughout his life, starting with those songs he wrote for Liverpool Express, Fortune, and Harlan Cage. Roger was able to attract some exceptional musicians at this point of his career, such as Ian Bairnson (guitarist). His primary choice of vocalist was Gregory Lynn Hall, he had found other musicians who were to his ears specialists in their fields, such as Alan Jeffrey, an emotive saxophone player. Never willing to stop, without finding the best instrumentalist to present his own beautifully written music for your ears...that is what Roger Scott Craig does, that is how his mind works. Liverpool Express Reunion The original line-up of Liverpool Express were reunited in August 2002, following global fan interest. This lead Roger to compile and release \\"The Best of Liverpool Express\\", which featured a brand new song, a tribute to The Beatles titled \\"John George Ringo & Paul\\". A reunion concert in Liverpool shortly followed, with Roger appearing on stage with current band members, Billy Kinsley, Kenny Parry, and Dave Goldberg.

Bateman wrote the novel while staying at the Fairyhouse Racecourse in County Meath. Plot This novel follows Dan Starkey who is currently both unemployed and single. His estranged wife Patricia, after cancelling their counselling sessions with Relate, has entered into another relationship with someone called Clive and is currently living with him in the family home. Starkey receives a request from Mark Corkery, known as \\"The Horse Whisperer\\", to investigate racing entrepreneur Geordie McClean who is apparently not quite as clean as his name would suggest. Reception The novel received little but positive coverage in the media. Ferdia Mac Anna, writing for the Irish Independent, stated that she found the feel of the novel to be \\"weirdly familiar but oddly cosy\\" where \\"everyone is on the make in one way or another and the heroes are either losers or drunks or both\\", calling Starkey's journey a \\"roller-coaster ride\\". She does note that \\"on occasion, the witty one-liners and outrageous scenarios grow a tad obvious\\", however also states that \\"I would rather read Bateman than many acclaimed works of serious literature\\". Mac Anna further goes on to state that \\"Bateman's great strength is that he satirises everything\\" and calling the novel \\"terrific entertainment and stylishly funny\\". Author John Gaynard stated that he was \\"a little disconcerted by the \\"stand up comedy\\" aspect\\" of the novel, yet he \\"persevered\\" and \\"came across some genuine moments of comedy\\". He opined that Bateman \\"is the sort of writer you either love or hate\\" and awarded the novel four stars, out of five.

Scott is best known for producing online videos for his YouTube channel, which mainly comprises educational videos across a range of topics including history, science, technology, and linguistics. , Scott's channel has more than 690 million views and 3.16 million subscribers. Early work Originally from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, Scott graduated from the University of York with a degree in linguistics. While at university, in 2004, Scott produced a website parodying the British government's \\"Preparing for Emergencies\\" website, including a section explaining what to do in case of a zombie apocalypse. This resulted in the Cabinet Office demanding the site be taken down; Scott sent a \\"polite response declining to take down the site\\"; as of September 2020, the site is still live. In 2008, Scott became the UK organiser of International Talk Like a Pirate Day, and was subsequently nominated by his friends to run for presidency of the University of York Students' Union as \\"Mad Cap'n Tom Scott\\". Despite running as a joke, he won the election and served as the organisation's 48th president. That same year, Scott and three friends formed the comedy troupe, The Technical Difficulties, with whom he hosted an eponymous radio show on University Radio York. The show later won the Kevin Greening award at the Student Radio Awards. After graduating, Scott made several appearances on British television shows both as a contestant and presenter. He captained the Hitchhikers in series 3 of BBC Four's Only Connect in 2010 but was knocked out by the Strategists in the semi-finals, and, in 2012, was a presenter in the Sky 1 series Gadget Geeks alongside Colin Furze and Creative Technologist Charles Yarnold, where he was responsible for the creation of software solutions. In 2010, Scott and the Technical Difficulties troupe began the \\"Reverse Trivia Podcast\\" series on the Technical Difficulties website wherein Scott would read the answer to a 1984 trivia question card while his fellow panellists attempted to guess the question. The show concluded in 2014 after the commencement of Citation Needed. Scott received widespread coverage in 2013 for \\"Actual Facebook Graph Searches\\", a Tumblr site which exposed a potentially embarrassing and dangerous collection of public Facebook data using Facebook's Graph Search, such as showing men in Tehran who have said that they were \\"interested in men\\" or \\"single women who live nearby and are interested in men and like getting drunk\\". YouTube Scott registered his main YouTube channel, Tom Scott (originally under the username 'enyay', derived from the letter √ë), on 17 May 2006. As of October 2020, the total view count of its public videos is 690 million.‚ÄúAbout‚Äù channel page tab of Tom Scott's YouTube channel Scott produces and uploads educational videos to the channel across a range of topics including linguistics, history, science and technology. Also hosted on the channel was a filmed version of Citation Needed with The Technical Difficulties over eight seasons, from March 2014 to November 2018. He additionally produced explanations of computer security issues on Brady Haran's YouTube channel, Computerphile. He is known for wearing red T-shirts, originally worn out of a need for continuity during filming. At the end of 2015, Scott launched a collaborative YouTube channel with his colleague and friend, Matt Gray, called Matt & Tom. The channel hosted The Park Bench wherein the pair would sit on a park bench and discuss videos, their travels, and other anecdotes. The series was produced weekly from its inception until 24 March 2018, when they announced that the series would no longer be produced on a regular schedule due to time constraints. In late 2018, the channel became a vehicle for videos of The Technical Difficulties, including \\"The Experiments\\" (2018), where the troupe piloted a number of game show ideas. As of 12 June 2019, it is airing their new series Two Of These People Are Lying, in which Scott has to guess which of the troupe is giving accurate information pertaining to a Wikipedia article whose title he has drawn from a prepared stack. On 9 April 2020, Scott published a video of which the view counter updates in the title of the video using a script programmed by him. In that video, he speaks about entropy, automation (e.g. Twitter bots), Internet history, and Yahoo Pipes.Video \\"This Video has 23,795,434 Views\\", accessed on 1 October 2020 02:27:24 UTC Other projects In 2014, Scott co-founded Emojli along with Matt Gray. It was a parody emoji- only social network based on social networking application Yo, and was described by Salon as \\"an inside joke turned into reality\\". It closed in July 2015 after it became too expensive to maintain. Scott followed this up in September 2015 by creating a full-size emoji keyboard out of fourteen standard keyboards to type every standard Unicode emoji. Other web apps Scott has created include \\"Evil\\" (a web app that revealed the phone numbers of Facebook users), \\"Tweleted\\" (which showed posts deleted from Twitter), \\"What's Osama bin Watchin?\\" (which mashed together an image of Osama bin Laden with YouTube Internet memes), \\"Parliament WikiEdits\\" (a Twitter bot that tweeted whenever an IP address from the Houses of Parliament edited Wikipedia), and \\"Klouchebag\\" (a satire of the social media rankings site Klout). 2010 UK general election In 2010, after losing a bet that the New Orleans Saints would lose Super Bowl XLIV, Scott ran for Parliament in the Cities of London and Westminster constituency as the joke candidate \\"Mad Cap'n Tom\\". This was a role he had previously assumed in the 2008 race for presidency of the University of York Students' Union, which he unintentionally won. Coincidentally, Scott stood against the Pirate Party candidate Jack Nunn, which was described on the BBC News Quiz as \\"a split in the pirate vote\\". As part of his bid, he promised to scrap taxes on rum, have schools offer courses in \\"swordsmanship and gunnery\\", hand out free rolls of duct tape to \\"fix broken Britain\\", and put a 50% tax on downloads of Cheryl Cole MP3s due to his dislike of the singer. He described his chances of winning in the safe Conservative seat of Westminster as \\"Somewhere 'twixt a snowball's chance in hell an' zero.\\" He received 84 votes (0.2% of the total), including the vote of Noel Gallagher, the former lead guitarist of Oasis.

They had been advisors for generations. On 12 September 1632, he was ennobled in Vienna, and his family name was officially changed into von Sturm zu Vehlingen. On 23 September 1633 in Ebersdorf, Emperor Ferdinand II gave him the predicate von Vehlingen. Nevertheless, his descendants used the family name von Sturm zu Vehlingen.Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Adelslexikon, vol. XIV, p 249, volume 131 of the series, C. A. Starke Verlag, Limburg an der Lahn, 2003, In the November 1635 Sturm declared that Count William Louis of Nassau- Saarbr√ºcken had forfeited his county. Sturm had a very important function in the region during the Thirty Years' War as a representative of the Emperor. On behalf of the Emperor, he administered lands whose sovereigns had fled or been deposed. He probably used his position to enrich himself. Sturm was portrayed as greedy.Verein f√ºr Nassauische Altertumskunde und Geschichtsforschung (eds.): Nassauische Annalen. Jahrbuch des Vereins f√ºr Nassauische Altertumskunde und ..., Wiesbaden, 1929 (1929), p. 162, Online From 1650, the Sturm family owned the castle at Odendorf in Swisttal. At the christening of his son Ferdinand Phillip Casimir on 14 April 1637, both the Emperor and King Philip III of Spain acted as godfather of honor. Bertram von Sturm zu Vehlingen died on 20 January 1637 in Frankfurt am Main and was buried in the local Dominican monastery. His tomb stone in the church, which is no longer available, showed this date. The register at Frankfurt states his death date as January 9. This difference can be explained as the effect of the Gregorian calendar reform, which only happened in Frankfurt in 1700.

For most of its history it has been in the ownership of the prominent Cornish family, the Vyvyan family. The house is set in over of woodland which, along with the shoreline of the Helford River, is designated as Merthen Woods Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). A secret deal undertaken in 2010 saw ownership drastically change hands to Henry Vyvyan after a long lasting dispute between the grandmother and grandchild History The land of Merthen was originally part of the manor of Winnianton, which was given to Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall by his brother, Henry III, in 1225, who then swapped it with Gervase de Tintagel for Tintagel Castle. Ralph Reskymer obtained Merthen in the early part of the 15th century, and it became family seat of the Reskymers. The current manor house is thought to have been built in 1575 by John Reskymer and his wife Grace, due to their coat of arms over the entrance, although it may originate earlier and the coat of arms are an indication a remodelling or reduction. Grace died in 1627, 10 years after her husband, and in 1629 it was sold to Sir Francis Vyvyan of Trelowarren and has remained with the family since. In the early 19th century the house was remodelled again, and the interior was renovated in the 20th century. Estate In the early part of Merthen's history it was the prominent place of the parish and had a deer park. Merthen Wood View of Merthen Woods on the Helford River The woods to the south of the manor house, on the banks of the Helford River, were designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1972 for their biological characteristics. The site is of importance due to its population of Sessile Oak (Quercus petraea). Other notable species within the woods include the nationally uncommon Bastard Balm (Melittis melissophyllum) and the nationally rare mosses Fissidens curnowii and Hookeria lucens. The woods are home to the largest British population of Anchonidium unguiculare rare weevil, which only exist in woodland along the Helford River within Britain.

It is the first of three books featuring the Makepeace sisters, Charlotte and Emma,Anita Silvey, ed: Children's books and their creators (New York, Houghton Mifflin, 1995), p. 238. These three books are sometimes known as the Aviary Hall books. Background At the age of twenty-one, Penelope Farmer was contracted for her first collection of short stories, The China People. Whilst working as a teacher for the London County Council Education Department, she was approached by editor Margaret K. McElderry of Harcourt Brace to write a children's novel. Farmer took one story originally intended for The China People, but which proved too long to include, writing, \\"It was too big an idea, too bony as a short story.\\"'Penelope (Jane) Farmer'. In Dictionary of Literary Biography. This was rewritten as the first chapter of The Summer Birds (1962), her first book featuring Charlotte and Emma Makepeace.'Penelope Farmer' in Something About the Author 105 (1999) p. 67 The main settings of the book are a small village school in the South Downs in southern England, and Aviary Hall, the girls' home. According to Farmer, Charlotte and Emma, who grow up in their Grandfather Elijah's house, were originally based on her mother and her mother's sister as children, having no parents and \\"‚Ä¶having to be everything to each other,\\" one being the responsible one, the other being rather difficult.'Penelope Farmer' in Something About the Author 40 (1985) p. 77 Plot summary Charlotte and Emma Makepeace are children living with their grandfather, Elijah, in a country house in the South Downs in southern England. Named Aviary Hall, the house is decorated with stuffed birds and images of birds. On the way to their small English village school, they meet and befriend a mysterious boy who tells them that he is able to teach them to fly. Over the following days and weeks, the boy teaches Charlotte to fly, and then the other children at the school learn this ability. The boy remains invisible to the adults, with the exception of the schoolteacher, Miss Hallibutt, who herself, as a child, had wished that she could fly. The boy tells her that he is unable to teach her to fly: he can only teach children. The children spend an idyllic summer flying above their village and the downs. As summer draws to an end, the boy offers to take the children on a journey, and the children prepare to go with the boy. Charlotte realises that the boy is not telling them the whole truth, and forces the boy to admit the truth. The boy reveals that while he wants to take them back to his country where they can fly forever, and be children forever, without adult responsibilities, the cost of following him is that they will never be able to return to their homes and their loved ones. The children decide that this indeed is too high a price to pay, and all decline to travel with the boy, with the exception of one girl, who has neither parents, nor a happy life to return to. The children return to their homes and prepare to begin a new term at school. Reviews The Summer Birds was highly acclaimed by reviewers on its release, with some reviewers understandably comparing it to J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan, as both books feature themes such as flying and unending childhood. Hugh Crago reviewed the book in Signal, writing, \\"The Summer Birds is Peter Pan pared down, the whimsy, the sentimentality and the extravagant pantomime mythmaking cut away, leaving the essential core of genuine wonder...\\" In 1963, Marion R. Hewitt reviewed the book in an article about Penelope Farmer in The Junior Bookshelf. She writes that the children in the story are \\"real and vital\\", in particular Charlotte, > ...[a] solid, sensible child but so sensitive that she feels everyone's > hurts. One knows, with deep pity, that she will always carry the weight of > the world on her shoulders. She is all children's conscience as the boy is > their fantasy. She continues her praise of Farmer's insightful descriptions of the events and emotions in the book, > This is a beautiful book. The description of the Downs at night has an > ethereal poetry and the sadness of the farewell [when the nameless boy > returns to his island home] is delicately and truthfully shown. It is part > of growing up, and the author never cheats by glossing over unhappiness.

Born in Scotland he belonged to the Ramsays of Dalhousie. His son William (fl. 1660) says that when James I succeeded to the crown of England, \\"he sent into France for my father, who was then there, and made him page of the bedchamber and groom of the privy chamber, and keeper of all his majesties' clocks and watches. This I mention that by some he hath bin termed no better than a watch maker. ‚Ä¶ It's confest his ingenuity led him to understand any piece of work in that nature ‚Ä¶ and therefore the king conferred that place upon him\\" (Wm. Ramesay, Astrologia Restaurata, 1653, Preface to the Reader, p. 28). On 25 Nov. 1613 he was appointed clockmaker-extraordinary to the king with a pension of 50l. a year, and in March 1616 a warrant was issued for the payment to him of 234l. 10s. for the purchase and repair of clocks and watches for the king. On 26 Nov. 1618 he was appointed chief clockmaker, and on 27 July 1619 letters of denization were granted to him. Various other warrants were passed for payments for his services, and in one which bears date 17 March 1627 he is described as ‚ÄòDavid Ramsay, esq., our clockmaker and page of our bedchamber.‚Äô His early works are marked ‚ÄòDavid Ramsay, Scotus.‚Äô On the incorporation of the Clockmakers' Company in 1631 Ramsay became the first master, but he probably took very little part in the work of the society. Upon taking the oath before the lord mayor he was described as ‚Äòof the city of London,‚Äô but the city records do not furnish any evidence that he was a freeman. Scott introduces a David Ramsay, without any strict regard for historical accuracy, in the opening chapter of ‚ÄòThe Fortunes of Nigel‚Äô as the keeper of a shop ‚Äòa few yards to the eastward of Temple Bar.‚Äô Ramsay was also a student of the occult sciences. In William Lilly's ‚ÄòLife and Times,‚Äô 1715, p. 32, an amusing account is given of an attempt made in 1634 by Ramsay and others to discover hidden treasure in Westminster Abbey by means of the divining rod, when the operations were interrupted by fierce blasts of wind, attributed by the terrified spectators to demons, who were, however, promptly exorcised. Sir Edward Coke, writing to Secretary Windebanke, on 9 May 1639, about a demand for money which it was inconvenient to meet, says: ‚ÄòIf, now, David Ramsay can co-operate with his philosopher's stone, he would do a good service.‚Äô There are also entries in the ‚ÄòCalendars of State Papers,‚Äô dated 28 July 1628 and 13 Aug. 1635, relating to hidden treasure which Ramsay proposed to discover. A manuscript in the Sloane Collection, No. 1046, bearing the title ‚ÄòLiber Philosophicus, de divinis mysteriis, de Deo, Hominibus, anima, meteoris,‚Äô is attributed to him on insufficient authority. He was also an inventor, and between 1618 and 1638 he obtained eight patents (Nos. 6, 21, 49, 50, 53, 68, 78, 117). Although the full ‚Äòtitles‚Äô of these patents are given in the indexes published by the commissioners of patents, no information as to the precise nature of the inventions is extant. They relate to ploughing land, fertilising barren ground, raising water by fire, propelling ships and boats, manufacture of saltpetre, making tapestry without a loom, refining copper, bleaching wax, separating gold and silver from the base metals, dyeing fabrics, heating boilers, kilns for drying and burning bricks and tiles, and smelting and refining iron by means of coal (Cal. State Papers, 1619, 1622‚Äì3‚Äì5). In his later years he fell into poverty, and in 1641, while a prisoner for debt, he petitioned the House of Lords for payment of six years' arrears of his pension as groom of the privy chamber (Hist. MSS. Comm. 4th Rep. p. 110 a). Towards the payment of those arrears the committee for advance of money, by an order dated 13 Jan. 1645, granted him one third of the money arising from his discovery of delinquents' estates (Cal. of Committee for Advance of Money, i. 40). It would appear from this that he had joined the parliamentary party. On 11 Feb. 1651 there is a note in the proceedings of the council of state that a petition of David Ramsay was referred to the mint committee (Cal. State Papers, 1651‚Äì2, p. 140). Specimens of Ramsay's watches are to be found in the British Museum, in South Kensington Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. A watch belonging to Mrs. Holmes of Gawdy Hall, Norfolk, is described in ‚ÄòNorfolk Arch√¶ology‚Äô (vi. 2). A technical description of several specimens is given in Britten's ‚ÄòFormer Clock and Watch Makers,‚Äô . His son William, in the dedication to his father of his ‚ÄòVox Stellarum,‚Äô 1652, refers to the latter's pecuniary difficulties, which gave ‚Äòoccasion to some inferior- spirited people not to value you according to what you both are by nature and in yourself.‚Äô The date of Ramsay's death is unknown, but he appears to have been living in 1653, the postscript of his son's ‚ÄòAstrologia Restaurata‚Äô being dated 17 Jan. of that year, ‚Äòfrom my study in my father's house in Holborn, within two doors of the Wounded Hart, near the King's Gate.‚Äô In the ‚ÄòCalendar of State Papers,‚Äô under date 21 June 1661, there is a petition of Sir Theophilus Gilby and Mary, widow of David Ramsay, who states that she raised troops for the king's service ‚Äòat Duke Hamilton's coming into England,‚Äô since which time she has been sequestered and plundered. But she may possibly have been the widow of another David Ramsay, a courtier, from whom it is very difficult to distinguish the clockmaker in contemporary records.

Aurbach began studying PTH as a medical student in the lab of Dr. William Parson. He continued this research as a fellow as Tufts University School of Medicine in the lab of Ted Astwood. Here, he was the first to isolate PTH using phenol extraction, and in 1959 he published a landmark paper on this discovery. In 1959, he joined the lab of William Jakoby at the National Institutes of Health, and two years later he established his own lab in the Metabolic Diseases Branch. He became chief of the branch in 1973, and remained at the institute for the remained of his career. He determined that parathyroid hormone acts through cyclic AMP, and demonstrated that pseudohypoparathyroidism is a disorder of the parathyroid hormone receptor complex. He also characterized several hereditary diseases related to hyperparathyroidism. In 1973, he was named director of the metabolic diseases branch of the National Institutes of Health, and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1986.

This broke the previous record by over nine hours. Bradshaw has raised thousands for charities such as Breakthrough Breast Cancer, Child Line and several Children‚Äôs Hospices. Bradshaw has earned her several honours. In 2004, she was nominated for the Sunday Times Inspirational Award. In 2006, she was awarded an MBE for 'Services to Swimming and Charity' which was the same year Loughborough University in recognition of her achievements conferred upon her an honorary doctorate. In 2007 Bradshaw was recognized with a place in the International Swimming Hall of Fame, Fort Lauderdale, USA. Bradshaw completed a further achievement in the history of long distance butterfly swimming in July 2011. She circumnavigated the 28.5 miles course around Manhattan Island in New York in the fastest documented (stroke based records are not certified) butterfly time of 9 hours and 28 minutes. There is an acknowledged title in the swimming world that of the Triple Crown. A Triple Crown is an elite group who have swum the English Channel (22 miles), Catalina Channel (22 miles) and Manhattan Island (28.5 miles). Swimmers do this on freestyle, yet only two swimmers in the world have achieved two of the three on the proper traditional butterfly, Bradshaw being one and Vicki Keith (Canada) the other. Bradshaw assists and enables others interested in long distance swimming to achieve their goals, in particular those wishing to swim the English Channel through her voluntary work with The Channel Swimming association.

He served as the President of Wheeling Jesuit University in West Virginia from 2000 to 2003. Much of Lundy's work in activism and academia centered on issues concerning social justice. Lundy was originally from Chicago, Illinois. He first joined the Society of Jesus, also known as the Jesuits, when at the age of 19. He received his bachelor's degree in sociology from Loyola University New Orleans and his master's degree from the Jesuit School of Theology. He also obtained a doctorate from the University of Chicago. Lundy joined the faculty of Loyola University New Orleans. He served as the director of the university's Institute for Human Understanding, which is now called the Twomey Center for Peace Through Justice, during the early 1980s. The center studies and works with social issues, notably justice, racism, workers' rights, and poverty. Lundy also joined Loyola's faculty, teaching courses in labor studies through the institute. Additionally, Lundy established his own school through Loyola, which taught labor leaders how to effectively organize and maintain a labor union. As part of the school, Lundy created and implemented a labor plan for a company, based in Germany, written in both German and English. During his tenure at Loyola, Lundy co-created a religious coalition in opposition to the death penalty with Sister Helen Prejean and Rev. Joe Morris Doss, the then Episcopal pastor of the Grace Episcopal Church in New Orleans and future Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey. In 1986, Loyola New Orleans President James C. Carter, S.J. appointed Lundy as the university's provost and vice president for academic affairs. Lundy had been serving as the director of the Institute for Human Relations at the time of his appointment. He worked as provost from 1986 to 1992. Lundy became the Vice President of University of Detroit Mercy, a Jesuit institution in Michigan, in 2000. Lundy was appointed the President of Wheeling Jesuit University in 2000, where he served for three years. Following his departure from Wheeling Jesuit, Lundy was sent to Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he served as the pastor for the university's Catholic Student Center. In 2011, Lundy returned to Loyola New Orleans, where he directed a Twomey Center for Peace Through Justice campaign to end the death penalty by gaining the support of medical professionals. Father George Lundy died of complications of a stroke at Tulane Medical Center in New Orleans on December 20, 2011, at the age of 64.

Early life and teaching career Weldon was born on September 29, 1920, to Myrtle and Stephen Weldon in Yackandandah in the north-eastern area of Victoria. He was educated by the Our Lady of Sion Sisters at Box Hill and then by the Marist Brothers at St Patrick‚Äôs College, Sale. catholicweekly.com Obit Br Othmar He began his novitiate in 1939. He was on staff at the Marist Brothers school in Lidcombe and then at St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill from 1941 to 1951. He was headmaster at Joeys from 1955 till the end of 1961 joeys.org, SJC Newsletter Jun2008 having earlier been headmaster at Marist Brothers Kogarah from 1952 to 1954. From 1962 to 1964 he was Headmaster at the Marist College Ashgrove. As Headmaster at Joeys, Brother Othmar effected a substantial building program still at a time before there was government funding for Catholic schools. Apart from the Chapel in 1939, there had been no construction of new classrooms, laboratories, dormitories or any essential building since the main college building had been completed in 1894. His major works as Headmaster were an olympic pool in the college grounds and the Pius X Building, a substantial complex of classrooms, laboratories, workshop rooms and squash courts, blessed by Cardinal Gilroy and opened by the Rt Hon.Robert Menzies on 16 July 1961. He also initiated the early planning of the college‚Äôs response to the Wyndham Scheme, resulting in new residential blocks for the two senior years, completed under Br Elias in 1967. During the opening of the Pius X Building, Prime Minister Menzies expressed a wish to return to the college to talk further with Brother Othmar. He came one evening some weeks later. After a further tour, they talked at length in the new chemistry laboratory, Brother Othmar standing at the demonstration bench and Prime Minister Menzies sitting at one of the student desks. Menzies sought Othmar's views on how the Federal Government could assist private schools within the framework of the Australian Constitution. Partly from that discussion, the Federal Government School Building Assistance Program was developed, a landmark change in education funding. The program was implemented through the States Grants (Science Laboratories and Technical Training) Act 1964. This proved to be the first of many programs of federal support for independent schools. Provincial and education leadership  In 1964 he was appointed Provincial of the Sydney Province of the Marist Brothers. He was to serve in this position for eight years, dealing with the changes in the Church following the Second Vatican Council and a General Chapter of the Marist Brothers. As Provincial, Othmar took decisions leading to school openings in Grafton (1965), Gladstone (1965), Canberra (1968), Enoggera (1970), Kolombangara (Western Solomons) (1971), Rokera (Solomon Islands) (1971) and the Pacific Novitiate in Lomeri in Fiji (1971). Many other schools were refurbished and expanded. His educational leadership was recognised by Cardinal Gilroy with an appointment to the Catholic Building and Finance Commission in the late 1960s. In the early days of government funding and the development of the system of parish and regional schools, it was the body responsible for the significant expansion of Catholic education in Sydney. Later life In 1988, Brother Othmar returned to South Africa as vocations recruiter. After eight years, which spanned both the apartheid era and some of the Mandela years, he returned to Daceyville, where he took up part-time duties with the Catholic Education Office Eastern Region. In 1999 he celebrated his Diamond Jubilee with a function attended by former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and a number of other former ministers, both state and federal. In 2006, he moved to Randwick to become part of the Marcellin House Community. He died on 2 June 2008 after a short stay at St Vincent‚Äôs Hospital.

They were the three brothers: Laurence Oliphant; James Oliphant; Sir Anthony Oliphant and also the latter's son, Laurence Oliphant.Hansard Lt. Col. James Oliphant married firstly, at Pudupattinam, 23 July 1822, to Lucy, daughter of George Maidman. James had seven children with Lucy (she died and was buried at Secunderabad, on 29 March 1832). James married secondly at Secunderabad, on 29 March 1832, to Sophia Ann, daughter of General Thomas Truman, of the Madras Army. Sophia and James had thirteen children together (she died 1 June 1897). One of the children was General William Stirling Oliphant of the Bengal Army and another was Arthur Craigie Oliphant, guardian of the children of the Maharajah Duleep Singh. One of Arthur Craigie's children was Sir Lancelot Oliphant, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Belgium and Director General of the Foreign Office. Lancelot was married to Christine McRae Sinclair, Viscountess Churchill.

In the case of the Raja Pratap Singh, Raja of Satara, there was controversy both in the Court of the East India CompanyDebates at India House on the Case Deposed Raja of Satara and Impeachment of Col C Ovans 1845 and in Parliament.Hansard 11 July 1848 As Sir James Hogg, 1st Baronet commented in the House of Commons in July, 1848: \\"Major Oliphant had given an opinion in favour of the Raja's innocence. The fact was, however, that Major Oliphant was the only one out of thirty directors who ever wrote or spoke one word, not merely against the honour, but against the propriety of the conduct of Colonel Ovans.\\" As John Elliot said in the same debate in the House of Commons, the issue brought into question the very integrity of the East India Company's government in Bombay. That the Raja of Satara was badly treated is not a matter of dispute today. In September, 1839 the Raja of Satara was dethroned, banished and stripped of his private property by the H.E.I.C.'s government in Bombay. The Raja had been presented with two choices, either admit to a host of charges, in which case he could retain his position or plead his innocence and be stripped of almost everything that he owned or stood for. Since the charges were concocted by his enemies (whom the British administration chose to stand with and would not give the Raja adequate opportunity to refute) the Raja rightly felt wronged. The Raja's one main ally was the Governor, Sir Robert Grant until the latter's death in July, 1838 - the same year that Oliphant, a fellow Scot retired from active service in India (and whose brother had been a Member of Parliament during the last two years of Grant's time in the House of Commons - 1832 to 1834). Whether there was any direct link between Oliphant and Grant is unknown.The Satara raj, 1818-1848: a study in history, administration, and culture. By Sumitra Kulkarni (1995) (pages 21, 22, 23, 24) That Oliphant's stance in the Satara affair in the 1840s brought controversy to the East India Company and questioned their integrity and that of Col C Ovans, does not seem to have affected Oliphant's career, as five years later he was elected Deputy Chairman and then the following year Chairman of that organisation.

The series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales that were transported to the \\"real world\\" town by a powerful curse. In the episode, Sheriff Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) helps two children (Karley Scott Collins and Quinn Lord) track down their father before they are placed in a foster care system, in a parallel with the story of Hansel and Gretel. Along the way, they encounter the Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla), and the Blind Witch (Emma Caulfield). \\"True North\\" was co-written by Liz Tigelaar and David H. Goodman, while being directed by Dean White. Co-creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz chose the story of Hansel and Gretel to help reveal Emma's difficult backstory, as the character lacked a fairytale counterpart. They cast Caulfield because they were fans of her work on the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The Blind Witch's gingerbread house had a computer-generated exterior, while its interior set was based on concept art designed by production designer Michael Joy. The episode first aired in the United States on ABC on January 15, 2012. An estimated 9.84 million viewers watched the episode on its original broadcast. It earned a Nielsen ratings share of 3.3/8 among adults, meaning that it was seen by 3.3 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 8 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of broadcast. This was a decrease of 11 percent from the previous episode. Critical reception was largely mixed to negative, with critics praising Caulfield's performance but critiquing other elements. Plot Opening sequence A gingerbread house is shown in the forest. In Storybrooke In a Storybrooke drugstore, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) meets a young girl named Ava (Karley Scott Collins). Henry is stopped by the store owner for shoplifting, which reveals Ava and her brother Nicholas (Quinn Lord) were using Henry to smuggle stolen merchandise. Regina (Lana Parrilla) and Sheriff Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) arrive to handle the juveniles. Emma discovers the siblings are living without parents and almost no food. In need of help, Emma resolves to find Ava and Nicholas's father (Nicholas Lea) out of a desire to keep them out of the foster system she herself was raised in. Regina calls social services, but the system would have to place the kids in two different homes in Boston. Determined to keep her promise not to separate them, Emma asks them for something that had belonged to their father. Ava provides her with a compass. Emma asks Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) about the compass and he searches his records. He finds a card that supposedly says Michael Tillman purchased the compass, and gives Emma this name. The card is revealed to be blank. Michael is the garage mechanic, and tells Emma he can barely handle the garage let alone twins. Emma has no choice but to take Ava and Nicholas to Boston on Regina's orders, despite Henry's warnings that no one can leave Storybrooke. That evening as the three are leaving, the vehicle breaks down as they reach the city limits, prompting Emma to call for help. Moments later, Ava notices her compass working. Michael arrives in his tow truck, and Emma explains that he at least has to see his children, as she could not leave Henry after seeing the life he had. Seeing Ava and Nicholas face to face changes his mind, and Michael accepts them into his life. Later, Emma shares Henry's theory with Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), that she is Snow White's daughter and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Mary finds this laughable, but seeing Emma's blanket triggers some sort of reaction from her. After a minute, however, she is quick to dismiss it as nothing. In the meantime, Henry asks Emma about his father. Emma tells Henry that his dad was a trainee fireman who used to frequent the diner where she worked. The two of them \\"hung out\\" a few times, resulting in Emma being pregnant with Henry before she went to jail. Once there, she tried to tell him about Henry, only to discover that he had died while saving a family from a burning building. However, she later admits to Mary the story she gave Henry was a lie and he should never know the truth about his father. After Emma's reunion of the children with Michael that evening, Henry arrived with pumpkin pie to give Emma in order to thank her for explaining about his birth father. They are interrupted by a stranger (Eion Bailey) on a motorcycle with a unique box. Without giving his name, he asks Emma about finding a place to stay. After referring him to Granny's Bed & Breakfast, she reminds Henry that he said no one else ever comes to or leaves Storybrooke and Henry replies that they don't. In the characters' past In the Enchanted Forest, Hansel (Lord) and Gretel (Collins), are searching for kindling while their father (Lea) chops firewood. He gives Gretel a compass so they won't be separated, but when they return, he is nowhere to be found. As they search they run into The Evil Queen (Parrilla) and are captured. She tells the two that she can help find their father, on the condition that they retrieve an item belonging to her from The Blind Witch (Emma Caulfield). They must enter her gingerbread house when The Blind Witch is asleep and fetch The Evil Queen's leather satchel, but they must not eat a thing. They break in safely, but Hansel gives in to the temptation of taking a bite of a cupcake, causing The Blind Witch to wake up. While she cannot see the children, she can smell their scent. The Blind Witch locks them up and prepares the oven to roast them. The two, working together, are able to push the witch into her own oven as The Evil Queen, who is gleefully watching the events from her mirror, magically sends a bolt of fire through her mirror into the witch's oven, roasting her alive. When the two return to The Evil Queen's palace, she opens the satchel to reveal a poisoned apple. The Evil Queen offers Hansel and Gretel a home at the palace, but they are adamant about returning to their father. She sends them back into the forest and summons her newest prisoner, Hansel and Gretel's father. The Evil Queen asks why the children turned down the luxurious life of the palace and he answers that they are family, and family finds each other. Frustrated, she sends him away to see if they indeed find each other. Production \\"True North\\" was co-written by co-executive producers David H. Goodman and Liz Tigelaar, while being directed by The Shield veteran Dean White. In an interview with Comic Book Resources, co-creator Edward Kitsis noted that it was difficult to pick iconic stories such as Cinderella and Hansel and Gretel because \\"the challenge becomes revealing a piece you never knew before or putting a fun twist on it.\\" According to actress Jennifer Morrison, they chose this particular story as a way to further reveal Emma's history, as she lacked a fairytale counterpart. Morrison explained, \\"They‚Äôre using Hansel and Gretel as they did Cinderella to reveal some of Emma‚Äôs backstory. So what Emma goes through to try to help these children ends up becoming very personal for her, as her own life [as a foster kid] is in a sense revealed.\\" Actress Emma Caulfield guest starred in \\"True North\\" as the Blind Witch who tries to eat Hansel and Gretel. For the Blind Witch, Kitsis and co-creator Adam Horowitz cast actress Emma Caulfield, as they had been \\"huge fans\\" of hers since she had co-starred on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Kitsis commented, \\"We couldn‚Äôt think of anyone better to trap two children in a house and try to eat them.\\" Caulfield had previously worked with series writer Jane Espenson and producer Liz Tigelaar on Buffy and Life Unexpected. Morrison remarked that while viewers do not see the Blind Witch in Maine, \\"Everyone who is in fairytale land definitely has a Storybrooke counterpart. Whether or not we see them immediately doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt exist.\\" The exterior of the gingerbread house was based on concept art created by production designer Michael Joy. While this ended up being computer-generated, Joy and set decorator Mark Lane created a physical set for the interior using an \\"inside-out cake\\" as inspiration. The two always enjoyed adding in small details for careful viewers to notice, so in \\"True North\\" they used the cookies Hansel and Gretel baked in Storybrooke as part of the house's interior design. Joy explained, \\"We're always trying to find ways to link the two worlds. The audience loves that kind of stuff.\\" In October 2011, TV Guide reported that Eion Bailey would be joining the series in a multi-episode arc; \\"True North\\" featured his first appearance as the Stranger. Other guest stars included Quinn Lord as Nicholas/Hansel, Karley Scott Collins as Ava/Gretel, Nicholas Lea as Michael Tillman/Woodcutter, Gabe Khouth as Mr. Clark/Sneezy, and David Bloom as Mr. \\"K\\" Krzyszkowski. Lord and Collins had previously guest starred in two Fringe episodes, as younger versions of Peter Bishop and Olivia Dunham. Collins appeared in \\"Subject 13\\" alongside another actor who played Peter. Cultural references Besides the main storyline being a retelling of the Hansel and Gretel fairytale, the episode contained a number of other cultural references. A rack full of Marvel Comics, including Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk, are shown in the opening scene, a double reference to both Marvel's parent company, Disney and the comic book's writer, Damon Lindelof, co-creator of Lost. An Apollo Bar was among the stolen items, and the Stranger's motorcycle license plate reads 23, both also references to Lost. Other comic books seen on the convenience store rack include various issues of Dazzler, Power Pack, West Coast Avengers, and Ka-Zar. Reception Ratings \\"True North\\" first aired on January 15, 2012 in the United States. It earned a Nielsen rating of 3.3/8 among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 3.3 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 8 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of broadcast. It was viewed by an estimated 9.84 million people, down 11 percent from the previous episode. Once Upon a Time finished fourth in its timeslot among total viewers and third among adults. It aired at the same time as the 69th Golden Globe Awards, which earned 16.8 million viewers. In Canada, the episode finished in thirteenth place for the week with an estimated 1.5 million viewers, an increase from the 1.297 million of the previous episode. Reviews \\"True North\\" received mixed to negative reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly writer Hilary Busis wished the episode \\"had done more to move the show's master plot forward, especially since watching it meant missing the first hour of the Golden Globes.\\" Busis also wished that Caulfield had received more screen time, calling her performance \\"superbly creepy.\\" IGN columnist Amy Ratcliffe rated the episode 6.5/10, explaining that the tone was \\"over-the-top\\" and Emma's actions to hide the children, rather than report them, \\"out of character.\\" Ratcliffe added on a more positive note that the Hansel and Gretel storyline was a \\"safe choice, but they made it work.\\" Cassandra Scrimgeour of The Huffington Post found \\"Parrilla's emotional reaction to the children's rejection [to be] so effective that despite her evil ways, I actually felt sorry for her.\\" Scrimgeour concluded that \\"the most intriguing thing to happen\\" in the episode was the arrival of the Stranger. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club was more critical of the episode, and gave it a D. He called the visual effects \\"hilariously bad,\\" likening the CGI to \\"a '90s computer game.\\" Sava added, \\"As mediocre as the series has been, it was on a bit of an upswing with the last few episodes, but 'True North' is a big step backwards... The problem isn‚Äôt that these kids can‚Äôt act (although that might be the problem), it‚Äôs that the writing for their characters is horrible... This week‚Äôs episode is straight-up children‚Äôs television, and not in the way that it can be enjoyed by all ages. You need to be a child to suspend your disbelief long enough to watch 'True North.'\\" Despite the critique, Sava did enjoy Caulfield's scenes, as well as Emma and Mary Margaret's conversation concerning motherhood. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Gwen Orel opined that the Hansel and Gretel \\"parallel is clear and rather sweet, with touches of the ongoing story of Emma and Snow White, too.\\" Orel felt the episode seemed \\"like a demented episode of Chopped,\\" and called the gingerbread house \\"just like it should [be], colorful and candylike.\\" References External links  Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Once Upon a Time (season 1) episodes Category:Works based on Hansel and Gretel ","title":"True North (Once Upon a Time)"},{"id":"34397801","text":"BTS Group Holdings Public Company Limited (BTSG), formerly known as Tanayong Public Company Limited, is a public company in Thailand.

The organization is a division of the University of Washington, based in Seattle. Although the division functions autonomously, they have worked to assist the University's efforts in support of the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies, and the Center for Innovation and Research in Graduate Education. Since 1915, they have published the works of first-time writers, including students, poets, and artists, along with authors known throughout the world for their work in the humanities, arts, and sciences. While the day-to-day functions of the organization are carried out independent of the university, the imprint itself is managed by a committee of faculty members, who have been appointed by the university president. Each manuscript must go through a collaborative approval process overseen by the editors and the University Press Committee before being chosen for publication under the University of Washington Press imprint. Once a selection has been approved for publication, the organization begins the production process, which includes typesetting and copy editing, along with cover design and promotions. Rather than printing in-house, all composition, printing, and binding services are contracted through external facilities. Approximately a third of the manuscripts published originate from within the university. The publishing house receives over 1,000 manuscripts and book proposals each year from throughout the world, with about seven percent approved for publication. Published titles include nonfiction works of history and culture, focusing on a variety of academic fields including Asian studies, Asian American studies, Middle Eastern studies, Western history, natural history, environmental studies, anthropology, biography, and fine art. , over 4,400 books have been published, with over 1,400 remaining in print.

In the 1960s, they began publishing works on Asian culture and history. In 1969, they established the Asian Law Series, which served to assist the Asian Law Center at the university. In the early 2000s, they increased their expansion efforts beyond the Pacific Northwest to include the Pacific Rim and Asia and embarked on publishing historical and cultural series through formal affiliations with facilities and departments of the University of Washington, as well as editors from prominent educational institutions from around the world. , over 20 volumes have been published, including the 2005 translation of Da Ming l√º (translated: The Great Ming Code); 2007's Writing and Law in Late Imperial China: Crime, Conflict, and Judgment; and Law in Japan: A Turning Point, published in 2008.

In 1999, the University of Washington Press published Ancient Buddhist Scrolls from GandhƒÅra: The British Library Kharosthƒ´ Fragments, written by Richard Salomon, who teaches Asian languages and literature at the university. , he continues to oversee the Early Buddhist Manuscripts Project, which encompasses research and analysis of ancient birch bark scrolls, which were discovered in the GandhƒÅra region of western Pakistan. Preserved in clay jars and buried in ancient monasteries, analysis is being done to determine if the scrolls are the oldest surviving Buddhist texts ever discovered. Known as Wiigwaasabak, the scrolls have been attributed to the Dharmaguptaka sect. Since the initial publication, the Press has released five volumes in the GandhƒÅran Buddhist texts series. The Critical Dialogues in Southeast Asian Studies series was established in 2004. The series is edited by members of the university's history and anthropology faculty. Works are published which focus on historiography; critical ethnography; colonialism, nationalism, and ethnicity; gender equality and sexuality; science and technology; political science and sociology; and the arts encompassing literature, drama, and film. , the Press has publishes six volumes, including Love, Passion, and Patriotism: Sexuality and the Philippine Propaganda Movement, written in 2008, by Raquel A.G. Reyes.  Partnerships  The organization has professional publishing partnerships with museums and university presses throughout the world, including Canada, China, and Australia.

It initially housed the collection of the Leverian Museum after it had been disposed of by lottery. For a period it was home to the Surrey Institution. In the early 1830s it notoriously was the centre for the activities of the Rotunda radicals. Its subsequent existence was long but less remarkable. Street view of the Rotunda as Leverian Museum.

James Parkinson came into possession of the collection of Sir Ashton Lever quite by chance: Lever put it up as a lottery prize, Parkinson's wife bought two tickets, gave one away, and died before the time the lottery draw was carried out. Construction of the Rotunda After trying to run the museum in its old location in Leicester Square, but finding the rent too much, Parkinson with other investors put up the Rotunda Building; it was of his own design, was constructed by James Burton, and was opened in 1787. The Rotunda building was circular and in brick; the roof was conical and in slate.'The borough of Southwark: Introduction', A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 4 (1912), pp. 125-135.

Disposal of the collection As well as trying to build it up as a business, Parkinson also tried to sell the contents at various times. One attempt, a proposed purchase by the government, was wrecked by the adverse opinion of Sir Joseph Banks. In the end, for financial reasons, Parkinson sold the collection in lots by auction in 1806.Survey of London: volumes 33 and 34: St Anne Soho (1966), pp. 441-72, from British History Online Among the buyers were Edward Donovan, Edward Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby, and William Bullock; many items went to other museums, including the Imperial Museum of Vienna.The Ibis, Series 3, Volume 3, Osbert Salvin, 1873, accessed 29 August 2010 Adaptation for the Surrey Institution When the Surrey Institution was being proposed, around 1807, the Rotunda Building (as it was then known) was adapted to the Institution's needs by Joseph T.

Romney Academy was first incorporated by the Virginia General Assembly on January 11, 1814, and was active until 1846 when it was reorganized as the Romney Classical Institute. In addition to the Romney Classical Institute, Romney Academy was also a forerunner institution to Potomac Seminary. Romney Academy was one of the earliest institutions for higher learning within the present boundaries of the state of West Virginia. With the growth of settlement in Pearsall's Flats, which was later the location of Romney, the need for educational facilities became apparent and the community began plans for the establishment of schools and churches. A log structure, which served as both a school and a church, was built at Pearsall's Flats around 1752 near Fort Pearsall. To provide for a teacher's payment, a form was circulated around Romney and each parent indicated on the paper how many of their children would attend the school and the type of payment the teacher would expect. By the time Romney was surveyed by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron laid out the town of Romney in 1762, the log school was still in existence. That year, a stone school building was erected on the site to the immediate north of the old Hampshire County Courthouse and became known as Romney Academy. Local education, including Romney Academy, continued to depend exclusively upon subscriptions until 1810 when the Virginia General Assembly passed what was known as the \\"Literary Fund\\". The assembly first incorporated Romney Academy on January 11, 1814. In 1817, the assembly passed a bill for the incorporating the trustees of Romney Academy. The Virginia General Assembly reincorporated Romney Academy on February 11, 1818, and on March 25, 1820. In 1820, as a result of a movement and debate for higher education by the Romney Literary Society, Romney Academy incorporated classical studies into its curriculum, thus making it the first institution of higher education in the region. By 1831, Romney Academy had outgrown its facilities, and the Romney Literary Society was given authorization to raise monies from a lottery to build a new school building. The society successfully raised the funds, and in 1845 bids were called for the construction of a new school building. On December 12, 1846, the Virginia General Assembly empowered the Romney Literary Society to establish a seminary for learning at the academy. That same year, a new brick building was constructed for the academy and for the library of the society; the building now serves as the central unit of the administration building of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind. Romney Academy was administered under the leadership of scholarly Englishman Dr. Henry Johnston, who was succeeded by Presbyterian Reverend and historian Dr. William Henry Foote. Foote introduced courses in theology into the school's curriculum. As the school's popularity grew and knowledge of its curriculum under Dr. Foote spread, Romney Academy began to attract students from beyond the South Branch Potomac River valley region. Other educators at Romney Academy during its early years were E. W. Newton, Silas C. Walker, Thomas Mulledy, and Samuel Mulledy. Thomas and Samuel Mulledy each later served as presidents of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.  Background  The land upon which Romney Academy was established was originally part of the Northern Neck Proprietary, a land grant that the exiled Charles II awarded to seven of his supporters in 1649 during the English Interregnum. Following the Restoration in 1660, Charles II finally ascended to the English throne. Charles II renewed the Northern Neck Proprietary grant in 1662, revised it in 1669, and again renewed the original grant favoring original grantee Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper and Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington in 1672. In 1681, Bennet sold his share to Lord Colepeper, and Lord Colepeper received a new charter for the entire land grant from James II in 1688. Following the deaths of Lord Colepeper, his wife Margaret, and his daughter Katherine, the Northern Neck Proprietary passed to Katherine's son Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron in 1719. The South Branch Survey of the Northern Neck Proprietary extended from the north end of The Trough to the confluence of the North and South Branches of the Potomac River. Lord Fairfax originally planned to maintain the South Branch Survey as his personal manor but later commissioned James Genn to survey the South Branch Potomac River lowlands for sale in 1748, with land lots ranging in size from to . Romney and its environs within the South Branch Survey were originally settled in the 1730s by Job Pearsall, and by 1748 approximately 200 people had settled at what was then known as Pearsall's Flats. Prior to 1762, Lord Fairfax sent surveyors into Hampshire County, who were charged with the selection of a site for what would later become the town of Romney. Pearsall's Flats was selected as the site due to its already having Fort Pearsall, a courthouse, and natural topographical advantages. Lord Fairfax commissioned a survey of Romney, and the town was laid out into 25 2-acre blocks with eight streets in a grid pattern in 1762. On December 13, 1762, the Virginia General Assembly recognized the stability of the upper Potomac frontier when it passed a bill establishing the town of Romney, and the bill was signed by Governor Francis Fauquier on December 23, 1762. In the early years in western Virginia, pioneer settlers were primarily concerned with providing defense from Native American attacks, so little emphasis was placed upon education. Education was viewed as a religious duty, to be provided for at home, where its quality was dependent upon the spare time and level of education of parents. With the growth of settlement in Pearsall's Flats, and later Romney, the need for educational facilities became apparent and the community began plans for the establishment of schools and churches. A log structure, which served as both a school and a church, was built at Pearsall's Flats around 1752 near Fort Pearsall. During his travels in western Virginia in 1753, George Washington made mention of this structure. The log building was constructed of roughly hewn logs with clay chinking and contained puncheon log floors, hewn side up, clapboard doors, and one small window covered by a paper greased with lard. Light in the log structure was provided by the small window and a fireplace measuring in height, which contained a tall pile of logs during the winter to provide for warmth in addition to lighting. The school's teachers were paid by subscriptions from the attending students. To provide for a teacher's payment, a form was circulated around Romney and each parent indicated on the paper how many of their children would attend the school and the type of payment the teacher would expect, whether in the form of cash renumeration, produce, or boarding. These early teachers were usually \\"wandering pedagogues, settling wherever they could obtain enough signers to insure a living\\". By the time the surveyors on behalf of Lord Fairfax had laid out the town of Romney in 1762, the log school was still in existence along with other public buildings. Later in 1762 following the establishment of Romney, the school was rebuilt in stone on the same site. The stone building was erected on the site to the immediate north of the old Hampshire County Courthouse and became known as Romney Academy. The stone building was a rugged square building that served as Romney's cultural center before the school was formally incorporated by the Virginia General Assembly, but the exact date of its construction is unknown. Romney Academy was first incorporated by the Virginia General Assembly on January 11, 1814. Following the American Revolutionary War, education in Virginia was provided predominantly by private \\"district schools\\" whose curriculum was decided by the people who funded them. On February 8, 1817, the first comprehensive bill for public education in the southern United States was introduced to the Virginia House of Delegates by Federalist delegate Charles F. Mercer. Mercer's bill provided for a centralized system for public education that was to be administered by a board of education and financed by the state of Virginia. The bill stated that primary schools were to be established first for \\"all free white children ... free of any charge whatever\\" and provided for the establishment of a system of academies, 48 for males and three for females, and four colleges that were to be dispersed throughout Virginia, and a university to be founded in a centralized location. The bill faced substantial partisan opposition and eventually failed. Despite the bill's failure, the Virginia General Assembly continued incorporated academies or \\"classical schools\\" throughout the state to provide primary and secondary education. Despite being incorporated by the assembly, the academies were not public and were instead funded through tuition fees, which were generally low but prevented a larger number of students from attending them. By 1860, the Virginia General Assembly had incorporated 250 of these academies, including Romney Academy. Establishment and development Local education, including Romney Academy, continued to depend upon subscriptions exclusively until 1810 when the Virginia General Assembly passed what was known as the \\"Literary Fund\\", which was to be apportioned among the Virginia counties for the education of the poor. In 1817, a bill \\"incorporating the trustees of Romney Academy in the county of Hampshire\\" was presented to the Virginia House of Delegates by Mr. Scott, a delegate on the Committee of Schools and Colleges. The bill was read a second time in the Virginia House of Delegates following a motion by Hampshire County delegate William Naylor, after which it was ordered to be \\"re-committed to the Committee of Schools and Colleges\\". An amended version of the bill was again presented to the Virginia House of Delegates for a third time by Mr. Scott, and it was passed by the legislative body and renamed \\"an act incorporating the trustees of Romney Academy in the county of Hampshire\\". A further provision for local education in Virginia was included in an act passed by the Virginia General Assembly in 1818 stating that: \\"It shall be the duty of the courts of the several counties, cities, and corporate towns‚Äîin the month of October or as soon thereafter as may be‚Äîto appoint not less than five or more than fifteen discreet persons to be called school commissioners.\\" The commissioners who were appointed in Hampshire County were John McDowell, David Gibson, John Pierce, John Randalls, Elisha Thompson, Charles Keller, Frederick Sheets, James Abernathy, and Robert Sherard. Accounts rendered to the Hampshire County court for the expenditure of the Literary Fund illustrated that \\"the average price of tuition, exclusive of books, paper, etc. has been within a small fraction of four cents for every day of each attendance for each poor child.\\" Because nearly 700 impoverished children in Hampshire County were entitled to the fund, each child was only able to receive only a few months' worth of schooling, and because of the limited facilities, only about half of the total number of eligible children were able to be taken care of at each of the two periods of enrollment. Romney Academy was formally established on February 11, 1818, when the Virginia General Assembly finally passed an act entitled \\"an act incorporating the trustees of Romney academy, in the county of Hampshire\\" in which the assembly incorporated Romney Academy and constituted and appointed a board of trustees for the operation of the institution. With a system of formal education underway in Hampshire County, forces were underway for the higher education in the community. On a winter evening in 1819, nine men in Romney conducting a meeting in the office of Dr. John Temple for the purpose \\"of taking into consideration the proprietary of financing a Society, having for its object the advancement of Literature and Science; the purchase of a Library by and for the use of its members; and their further improvement by discussing before the Society such questions as shall be selected under its directors.\\" The nine men consisted of Thomas Blair, David Gibson, James P. Jack, Virginia author and historian Samuel Kercheval, Nathaniel Kuykendall, Charles T. Magill, James M. Stephens, John Temple, and W. C. Wodrow. Shortly after the formation of the Romney Literary Society, the society recognized that the quality of the education provided by Romney Academy and other local subscription schools was not meeting the needs of the Romney community, and therefore, it launched a movement to establish an institution for \\"the higher education of the youth of the community\\". The society frequently debated upon theories of education advancement and popular education. In 1820, as a result of this movement and debate, Romney Academy incorporated classical studies into its curriculum, thus making it the first institution of higher education in the region. The institution was again incorporated by the Virginia General Assembly on March 25, 1820. By 1831, Romney Academy had outgrown its facilities, and the Romney Literary Society commenced its campaign to raise funds for a new academic building. On January 6, 1832, the Virginia General Assembly authorized the society to raise $20,000 by lottery for educational purposes. Following a ten-year lapse after this authorization, the society made arrangements with James Gregory of Jersey City, New Jersey, and Daniel McIntyre of Philadelphia to finance the lottery, \\"for raising a sum of money not exceeding Twenty Thousand dollars, for the purpose of erecting a suitable building for their accommodation, the purchase of a library and Philosophical apparatus\\". The lottery was to be conducted for a period lasting 10 years, and the sums of $750, $1,000, and $1,500 were to be raised in semi-annual installments. The society successfully raised the funds, and in 1845 bids were called for the construction of a new school building. On December 12, 1846, the Virginia General Assembly empowered the Romney Literary Society \\"to establish at or near the town of Romney a Seminary of Learning for the instruction of youth in various branches of science and literature; and the Society may appropriate to the same such portion of the property which it now has or may acquire, as it may deem expedient\\". That same year, a new brick building was constructed for the academy and for the library of the society, which now serves as the central unit of the administration building of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind. Following the school's move to the building, it was reorganized as the Romney Classical Institute with Foote as its principal. Faculty and curriculum The earliest faculty members of Romney Academy are unknown, but the institution's first principal and one of the institution's longest serving teachers from its era of infancy was scholarly Englishman Dr. Henry Johnston. Under Johnston's leadership, Romney Academy became known regionally for its courses in the \\"higher classics\\" and made Romney the seat of one the Eastern Panhandle's most successful academies. Johnston believed in the \\"rule of the birch rod\\" and discipline was no light matter under his leadership. Some of Romney's prominent men in its early history were among Johnston's students. Other educators at Romney Academy during its early years were E. W. Newton, Silas C. Walker, a Mr. Brown, Thomas Mulledy, and Samuel Mulledy. Thomas and Samuel Mulledy each later served as presidents of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Presbyterian Reverend and historian Dr. William Henry Foote succeeded Johnston as principal of Romney Academy around 1826. Foote served in that capacity until his departure from Romney around 1837 or 1839. Foote also concurrently served as the pastor of the Romney Presbyterian Church. Foote introduced courses in theology into the school's curriculum, which broadened the make-up of the student body to include young men preparing for the ministry. As the school's popularity grew and knowledge of its curriculum under Dr. Foote spread, Romney Academy began to attract students from beyond the South Branch Potomac River valley region. Following Foote's departure, Reverend Theodore Gallaudet served as Romney Academy's principal. Board of trustees The inaugural board of trustees were constituted and appointed by the Virginia General Assembly in 1818. Because there were several vacancies among the board of trustees, on March 25, 1839, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act, appointing a new board of trustees consisting of David Gibson, John Baker White, Angus William McDonald, Daniel Mytinger, and John Kern, Jr. In addition, the 1839 act authorized any of the five appointed trustees of Romney Academy to fill vacancies on the board \\"occasioned by death, resignation, removal, or legal disability\\", thereby preventing future prolonged vacant trustee seats. Romney Academy trustee John Baker White was a clerk of both the circuit and county courts of Hampshire County and was the father of Robert White, Attorney General of West Virginia from 1877 until 1881. Robert White successfully lobbied the West Virginia Legislature to pass an act establishing the Institution for the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind of West Virginia (later named the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind), which utilized the former campus of the Romney Classical Institute, a successor educational institution to Romney Academy. Another trustee, Angus William McDonald, was the father of Marshall McDonald, who served as commissioner of the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries from 1888 until 1895. Building Romney Academy utilized a native stone structure located behind the Hampshire County Courthouse at a site presently occupied by the Courthouse Annex building (1934) at 66 North High Street in Romney. According to West Virginia historians Hu Maxwell and Howard Llewellyn Swisher in their History of Hampshire County, West Virginia (1897), the Romney Academy building was one of the earliest educational facilities in the county and regarding its architecture, Maxwell and Swisher noted: \\"the rough unhewn stones of which the academy was built gave it a very uncouth exterior.\\" By 1831, Romney Academy had outgrown its quarters in the old stone school building and relocated to a new Classical Revival structure completed in 1846, after which the institution was reorganized as the Romney Classical Institute. After the academy's stone building ceased being used as an educational facility, it was subsequently utilized for various purposes including serving as the offices of the Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser newspaper and as a meeting place for local fraternal organizations. Romney Academy's stone building remained dormant and unoccupied for a number of years and was demolished by the time Maxwell and Swisher researched and authored their History of Hampshire County, West Virginia in the late 1890s. Notable alumni During its brief years of operation between 1814 and 1846, Romney Academy educated a number of notable alumni. According to Seldon Brannon's Historic Hampshire (1976), \\"among the pupils of this school were some of the most prominent men in the early history of the [Romney] community.\\" The academy's students included William C. Clayton, a West Virginia state senator; John Jeremiah Jacob, 4th Governor of West Virginia; Angus William McDonald, Jr., a West Virginia lawyer, politician, and military officer; and Reverend Stuart Robinson, a Presbyterian minister, orator, writer, and editor. Legacy According to West Virginia historian Hu Maxwell in his article entitled \\"West Virginia a Century Ago\\" published in The Transallegheny Historical Magazine (1901), Romney Academy was \\"one of the oldest and most renowned schools on the early soil of West Virginia\\". Of the institution, Maxwell stated that \\"from its halls went forth some of the teachers who became the disseminators of learning in the famous South Branch [valley]‚Äîwhose people might appropriately be called the Phoenicians of the Alleghenies, the carriers of liberty, equality, and education.\\"  References  Bibliography            * Category:1752 establishments in Virginia Category:1814 establishments in Virginia Category:1846 disestablishments in Virginia Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1752 Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1762 Category:Buildings and structures in Romney, West Virginia Category:Defunct schools in Virginia Category:Defunct schools in West Virginia Category:Demolished buildings and structures in West Virginia Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 1846 Category:Educational institutions established in 1752 Category:Educational institutions established in 1814 Category:Romney Literary Society Category:Schools in Hampshire County, West Virginia Category:Stone school buildings Category:Stone buildings in the United States ","title":"Romney Academy"},{"id":"34398064","text":"Calisto muripetens is a butterfly of the family Nymphalidae.

In 1906 he and his two brothers opened their first gallery in Paris, the Brummer Gallery. At the start of World War I, they closed the gallery and moved to New York City. Joseph alone opened his next gallery in 1921 in Manhattan. Biography Joseph (originally J√≥zsef) Brummer was born in Sombor, then in Hungary (now Serbia), in 1883. He studied applied arts in Szeged from 1897 on, and continued these studies in Budapest from 1899 on. Afterward, he studied at Munich before starting on his own as an artist in Budapest and Szeged. Together with his brothers Ernest (1891-1964) and Imre (died 1928), he moved to Paris in 1905. In 1906, Brummer and his brothers opened the Brummer Gallery in Paris at the Boulevard Raspail, where they sold African art, Japanese prints and pre-Columbian, mainly Peruvian art, alongside contemporary paintings and sculptures. During the autumn of 1908, he shared a studio space at Cit√© Falgui√®re with avant-garde sculptor Joseph Csaky, who was also from Szeged and Budapest.Edith Balas, 1998, Joseph Csaky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture, American Philosophical Society Brummer studied sculpture under Jules-Felix Coutan, Auguste Rodin and in 1908 Henri Matisse. He also attended the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re, and thus got to know contemporary artists. At the start of World War I, Joseph Brummer closed in Paris and moved to New York City. In 1921 he reopened a gallery at 43 East Fifty-Seventh Street in Manhattan. He specialized in medieval and Renaissance European art, and Classical, Ancient Egyptian, African, and pre-Columbian objects, but also hosted some of the earliest exhibitions of modern European art in the United States. It stayed in business until 1949, two years after Joseph's death. A major part of his private art collection was bought by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1947. A second part of the Joseph Brummer art collection, still over 2400 lots, was sold in 1949 by Parke-Bernet Galleries. The final part, 600 pieces that remained in the family, were sold in Zurich in October 1979. These pieces were eventually inherited by Ernest Brummer's widow, Ella Bache Brummer. Their value was estimated at $10 million. From 1931 until 1948, Brummer had owned the Guennol Lioness; between 2007 and 2010, it was the most expensive sculpture ever sold at auction. In 1909 Brummer had his portrait painted by Henri Rousseau. and by Anne Goldthwaite in 1915. In 1993, the Rousseau portrait was sold by Christie's for ¬£2,971,500 ($4,421,592). It is currently owned by the National Gallery. Gallery The New York branch of the Brummer Gallery was opened in 1914 by Imre and Joseph Brummer. Joseph and his brothers Ernest were among the most significant art dealers of the first half of the 20th century, dealing in a broad range of art that spanned from classical antiquity to modern art. Their collection included many works from the Middle Ages, Pre-Columbian America, and Renaissance and Baroque decorative arts. Following Joseph Brummer's death in 1947, the gallery closed down in 1949, and its collection was auctioned off over the next three decades.

The Lost Chapters  In 2018, Schwartz published her memoir The Lost Chapters: Reclaiming My Life, One Book at a Time (Blue Rider Press, ) about her 2014 sentence in the Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood, California. It juxtaposes her experiences in jail with the 22 books she had sent to her there, each of which seemed to arrive at the most appropriate time. Schwartz especially credits Ruth Ozeki's A Tale for the Time Being for changing her life. The memoir also sympathetically describes the women that she was imprisoned with, and criticizes the cruel and dehumanizing system that incarcerates them without treating them. The book received favorable reviews.

It was assigned to the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division and served in the Middle East and later in the trenches of the Western Front in the First World War. In the Second World War the brigade, now redesignated 125th Infantry Brigade, fought in Belgium and France before being evacuated at Dunkirk and was then converted into 10th Armoured Brigade. Throughout its existence the brigade was composed almost entirely of battalions of the Lancashire Fusiliers, except for a few brief months in the early half of the Second World War. Formation Upon the creation of the Territorial Force in April 1908, the four Volunteer battalions attached to the Lancashire Fusiliers were organised into a brigade within the East Lancashire Division. The battalions were drawn from the Lancashire towns of Bury (5th Battalion), Rochdale (6th Battalion) and Salford (7th and 8th battalions), with Brigade HQ at Preston.Becke, Pt2a, pp. 36‚Äì41.http://www.1914-1918.net/lancsfus.htm First World War On the outbreak of the First World War, the East Lancashire Division mobilised and was sent to Egypt to relieve Regular Army troops of the British Army. Those men who had not volunteered for overseas service were left behind, together with floods of recruits, to form 2nd Line battalions (2/5th‚Äì2/8th Lancashire Fusiliers) in a 2nd East Lancashire Division. The 1st Line battalions were then renumbered 1/5th‚Äì1/8th. On 26 May 1915 the East Lancashire Division was renamed 42nd (East Lancashire) Division, and the Lancashire Fusilier Brigade was numbered 125th (Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade. (In August 1915 the 2nd Line brigade became 197th (2/1st Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade in 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division.)Becke, Pt2b, pp. 68‚Äì74. Order of battle The 125th Brigade was constituted as follows during the war:http://www.1914-1918.net/42div.htm Brigadier-General C.H. Frith Brigadier-General H. Fargus from 23 June 1917 * 1/5th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers (from Bury) * 1/6th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers (from Rochdale) (left 19 February 1918) * 1/7th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers (from Salford) * 1/8th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers (from Salford) * 125th Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps (formed 4 March 1916, moved to 42nd Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 25 February 1918) * 125th Trench Mortar Battery (joined 26 March 1917) When British infantry brigades on the Western Front were reduced to three battalions in February 1918, 1/6th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers left and joined 197th (2/1st Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade of the 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division, where it merged with the 2/6th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers and became the 6th Battalion once again. Gallipoli Ernest Brooks In early May 1915, the 42nd Division embarked from Alexandria for Cape Helles on the Gallipoli Peninsula, where Allied troops had landed a few days earlier. 125th Brigade was the first part of the division to go into action, at the Second Battle of Krithia under the command of the Regular 29th Division. It then reverted to 42nd Division, and took part in the Third Battle of Krithia and Battle of Krithia Vineyard. The fighting was 'a singularly brainless and suicidal type of warfare',North, p. 144 and virtually nothing was achieved in any of these attacks, at the cost of heavy casualties. Two brigades (the other being 126th (1/1st East Lancashire) Brigade) of 42nd Division attacked on the second day of the Krithia Vineyard battle: 'By nightfall both brigades were back in their old lines, with the exception of some parties of the 6th and 7th Lancashire Fusiliers, who defended the Vineyard against repeated Turkish attacks until, after a bitter and pointless struggle during the following five days, a trench dug across the centre of this worthless tract of scrub became the British front line'. After this failure, the Helles front was shut down and no further attacks were made. Five months later, following repeated failures elsewhere, the whole Gallipoli Campaign ended in evacuation back to Egypt. Recuperation The 42nd Division returned to Egypt in January 1916 with less than half the strength with which it had set out. It was stationed in Egypt for the next year, defending the Suez Canal and taking part in the Battle of Romani (4‚Äì5 August). Western Front In February and March 1917, the whole of 42nd Division moved from Egypt to France to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front, where it remained for the rest of the war. After re- equipping and training for trench warfare in a 'quiet sector' with Fourth Army, 42nd Division relieved 15th (Scottish) Division in Fifth Army in the Ypres Sector at the end of August. On 6 September 125th Brigade carried out an unsuccessful attack on strongly-held German pillboxes around Iberian, Borry, and Beck House Farms. The small amount of ground they took was given up the next day. The 42nd Division was then returned to holding quiet sectors, at Nieuport and then Givenchy. It was now part of IV Corps in Third Army, in which it remained for the rest of the war. During the German Army's Spring Offensive (Operation Michael or the First Battles of the Somme 1918), the troops of 42nd Division took part in the Battle of Bapaume (24‚Äì25 March), First Battle of Arras (28 March) and the Battle of Ancre (5 April). Then, during the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, it participated in the Battle of Albert (21‚Äì23 August) where Lance Corporal Edward Smith of the 1/5th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers was awarded the Victoria Cross. The brigade later fought in the Second Battle of Bapaume (31 August‚Äì3 September) during the fighting on the Somme. On the Hindenburg Line it was in the Battle of the Canal du Nord, where the Official History records that 125th Brigade's advance at 07.52 on 27 September 'was met by very heavy fire in front from machine guns which the barrage did not seem to have touched, and from Beaucamp on the right ... It reached an intermediate objective about five hundred yards from the front line and towards noon a little beyond this; but there it had to remain'.Edmonds, p. 44. However IV Corps renewed the attack after dark: 'The night was very dark and rainy, but the attack was a complete success; the enemy was surprised; very little opposition was encountered and many prisoners were taken. Under barrages moving a hundred yards in 5 minutes, the front lines of the 125th and 127th Brigades of the 42nd Division ... went forward in succession'.Edmonds, p. 47. 42nd Division resumed the attack the following afternoon (28 September), 'when the 125th and 126th brigades (the latter passing through the 127th), after some opposition, reached the top of Welsh Ridge, the objective of the division'.Edmonds, p. 48. Third Army's advance in Picardy culminated in the Battle of the Selle from 17 to 23 October. On 23 October 42nd Division was given the task of taking three successive objectives before the New Zealand Division passed through to continue the attack. 125th Brigade led the attack with two battalions in front, but in spite of a defensive smoke barrage they suffered considerably from enemy shelling during assembly. The defenders of Beaurain 'made a stout resistance and there was hard fighting in the early stages of the attack, men on both sides being killed by the bayonet'.Edmonds, p. 365. The left of 125th Brigade reached its objective by 04.45, but the rest of the line did not do so until 08.00. The New Zealanders passed through and successfully reached their objectives. The division was then withdrawn into reserve and halted around Beauvois-en- Cambr√©sis from 24 October until the advance was resumed on 3 November. On 7 November the 42nd Division was tasked to take the high ground west of Hautmont and if possible to capture the town. The division was held up by enfilade fire from the right, and 126th Brigade did no more than occupy some of the high ground. 125th Brigade was therefore ordered to pass through it the next morning and advance to the objective. But the 126th, 'in an endeavour to atone for its slowness on the 7th', pushed on and reached Hautmont before 125th could catch up.Edmonds, p. 510. The 125th was unable to cross the Sambre because the pontoons had not arrived, so it retraced its steps to its overnight billets near Pont sur Sambre and crossed there. The brigade then forced back the enemy rearguards, and after dark its patrols went forward and cleared them off the high ground near Fort d'Hautmont, one of the outer forts of the Fortress of Maubeuge.Edmonds, p. 523. On 9 November the brigade encountered no resistance in reaching its assigned objective,Edmonds, p. 530. and by 10 November the most forward troops were on the Maubeuge‚ÄìAvesnes-sur- Helpe road. This was the end of the fighting, because the Armistice with Germany came into the effect the following day. In December the division moved into quarters in the Charleroi area and by mid-March 1919 most of its troops had gone home for demobilisation. Interwar years The Territorial Force was disbanded after the Great War and so both the brigade and division were also disbanded. However, the division reformed in 1920 in the Territorial Army, which was formed on a similar basis as the Territorial Force. The brigade was also reformed, now as the 125th (Lancashire Fusiliers) Infantry Brigade, again with all four Territorial battalions of the Lancashire Fusiliers. Unlike the other infantry brigades in the division, the 125th Brigade's organisation remained much the same. However, in the late 1930s the Territorial Army's infantry was reorganised and, with a reduced need for so many infantry units, many of them were converted into other roles, mainly anti-aircraft or searchlight units, of either the Royal Artillery or Royal Engineers. As a result, the 7th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers was transferred to the Royal Engineers and converted into the 39th (The Lancashire Fusiliers) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, Royal Engineers, equipped with searchlights, and joined the 33rd (Western) Anti-Aircraft Group, 2nd Anti-Aircraft Division.https://web.archive.org/web/20060103225102/http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/inf/020LancF.htm It appears they were not replaced in the brigade. Shortly after, in 1939, the brigade was redesignated the 125th Infantry Brigade. Second World War The brigade and division, and the rest of the Territorial Army, were mobilised on 1 September 1939, the day the German Army launched its invasion of Poland. The Second World War officially began two days later, on 3 September 1939, and the men of the brigade and division were called up for full-time war service. Once again the 125th Infantry Brigade was composed of three battalions of the Lancashire Fusiliers. Both the brigade and division immediately began training in preparation for eventual overseas service. France and Dunkirk The 125th Brigade, commanded at the time by Brigadier George Sutton a Territorial officer, landed in France on 15 April 1940 with the rest of the 42nd Division and became part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). The division came under command of III Corps, under Lieutenant-General Sir Ronald Adam, which also included the Regular 5th Infantry Division and Territorial 44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division. Both the 42nd and 44th Divisions had, before deployment to France, been held back from reinforcing the BEF in order to participate in potential operations in Northern Europe, although this had never came to fruition.Fraser, p. 30. In early May the 1/8th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers was exchanged with the 1st Battalion, Border Regiment from 4th Infantry Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, another Regular formation. This was part of the BEF's official policy of mixing the Regular and Territorial Armies and was intended to, in theory, strengthen the TA divisions.Fraser, p. 28. After the defeat at the hands of the German Army during the Battle of France, the brigade, after sustaining very heavy casualties, was evacuated from Dunkirk on 30 May 1940. With the 42nd Division, the brigade would spend most of its time in the United Kingdom reforming and absorbing large numbers of men who had been conscripted into military service as replacements, on home defence and training to repel an expected German invasion. In December, the 1st Battalion, Border Regiment was transferred to 31st Independent Infantry Brigade and was replaced by 9th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers, a newly raised hostilities-only unit created only a few months before in June. Conversion On 1 November 1941, 42nd Division was converted to 42nd Armoured Division, and 125th Brigade was renamed 10th Armoured Brigade. 1/5th, 1/6th and 9th Lancashire Fusiliers (a war service battalion raised in June 1940) became respectively the 108th, 109th and 143rd regiments of the Royal Armoured Corps.Joslen, p. 164. Like all infantry units transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps, they still maintained their infantry cap badges on the black beret of the Royal Armoured Corps. When the 10th Armoured Brigade was scheduled for disbandment in late 1943, Members of Parliament for the Lancashire towns complained about the loss of their Territorial battalions. Nevertheless, the disbandment went ahead in November 1943.10th Armoured Brigade War Diary, August & November 1943, The National Archives, Kew file WO 166/10742 Of the battalions, only the 5th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers was reconstituted after the war.https://web.archive.org/web/20051227043136/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil- england/vinf-no/la-f5.htm Order of battle The 125th Infantry Brigade was constituted as follows during the war:Joslen, p. 310. * 1/5th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers * 1/6th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers * 1/8th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers (left 4 May 1940, to 4th Brigade)Joslen, p. 234. * 125th Infantry Brigade Anti-Tank Company (formed 31 December 1939, disbanded 25 January 1941) * 1st Battalion, Border Regiment (from 4th Brigade 4 May 1940, moved to 31st Brigade 1 December 1940)Joslen, p.279. * 9th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers (newly raised; joined 1 December 1940) Commanders The following officers commanded 125th Infantry Brigade during the war: * Brigadier G.W.

They are up to 10.5 centimeters long by 5.5 wide and are oval in shape. The inflorescence is a fascicle of cylindrical flowers which are usually pink but may be white or red. The fruit is a capsule. The plant mostly reproduces vegetatively, but it also reproduces by seed. In soils poor in nutrients it does not flower and reproduces only by sprouting from the rhizome. This plant is a common species, growing in shrubby bogs, wet savannas, conifer swamps, and scrub. There are large populations in saw palmetto prairie habitat. It is common in the Okefenokee Swamp. It grows in dry habitat but it is usually found in wet places, including habitat that is periodically flooded. It prefers acidic, saturated soils rich in organic matter, such as those in cypress swamps. It may grow in shady understories but it does well in full sun.

It was assigned to the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division and served in the Middle East and on the Western Front in the Great War. In the Second World War, now as the 126th Infantry Brigade, it served again with the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division in France and was evacuated at Dunkirk and then later converted into 11th Armoured Brigade. For most of its existence the brigade was composed of battalions of the East Lancashire Regiment and the Manchester Regiment, although in the late 1930s and the Second World War it was composed of battalions of the King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) and the Border Regiment. Formation On the creation of the Territorial Force in 1908, two Volunteer battalions from the East Lancashire Regiment, the 4th and 5th, and two from the Manchester Regiment, the 9th and 10th, were organised into an East Lancashire Brigade within the East Lancashire Division.Becke, pp. 35‚Äì41. First World War On the outbreak of the First World War, most of the men volunteered for overseas service and the division embarked at Southampton and sailed for Egypt on 10 September 1914, the first TF division to leave England for foreign service. The division began disembarking at Alexandria on 25 September and the bulk (including the East Lancashire Brigade) concentrated at Cairo. Order of battle During the war, the East Lancashire Brigade was constituted as follows: * 1/4th Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment (from Blackburn) (left February 1918) * 1/5th Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment (from Burnley) * 1/9th Battalion, Manchester Regiment (from Ashton-under-Lyne) (left February 1918) * 1/10th Battalion, Manchester Regiment (from Oldham) * 126th Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps (formed 14 March 1916, moved to 42nd Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 23 February 1918) * 126th Trench Mortar Battery (joined 26 March 1917) * 1/8th Battalion, Manchester Regiment (from 127th Brigade February 1918) When British infantry brigades were reduced to three battalions in February 1918, 1/4th East Lancs and 1/9th Manchesters transferred to the 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division where they merged with their 2nd line battalions. 126th Brigade received 1/8th Manchesters from 127th Brigade in 42nd Division. At the same time, the machine gun company left to join a new divisional machine gun battalion. Commanders The following officers commanded the East Lancashire Brigade during the war: * Brigadier- General D.G. Prendergast * Brigadier-General Viscount Hampden (from 13 July 1915) * Brigadier-General A.W. Tufnell (from 1 January 1916) * Brigadier- General A.C. Johnston (from 14 September 1917; wounded 16 September) * Brigadier-General W.W. Seymour (from 19 September 1917) * Brigadier-General G.H. Wedgwood (from 25 May 1918) * Brigadier-General T.H.S. Marchant (from 5 September 1918) Egypt and Gallipoli The East Lancashire Division remained in Egypt training and manning the Suez Canal defences until 1 May 1915 when it embarked at Alexandria for Gallipoli. The East Lancashire Brigade first went into action at the Third Battle of Krithia In late May 1915 the division was numbered as 42nd (East Lancashire) Division ‚Äì taking the lowest number of any TF division in recognition that it was the first to go overseas ‚Äì and the brigades were also numbered, the East Lancashire becoming 126th (1/1st East Lancashire) Brigade. The battalions adopted the prefix '1/' (becoming 1/4th East Lancs, for example) to distinguish them from their 2nd Line duplicates then training in the United Kingdom as the 198th (2/1st East Lancashire) Brigade in 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division. The 126th Brigade participated in the Battle of Krithia Vineyard (6‚Äì13 August), where Lieutenant William Thomas Forshaw of the 1/9th Battalion, Manchester Regiment was awarded the Victoria Cross, and then for the rest of 1915 was engaged in trench warfare. After the evacuation from Gallipoli, the division returned to Egypt in January 1916 with less than half the strength with which it had set out. It remained in the Canal Defences for the whole of 1916, rebuilding its strength, and taking part in the Battle of Romani (4‚Äì5 August). Western Front In January 1917, 42nd Division was ordered to France, the move being completed by mid-March. It spent the remainder of the war on the Western Front. During 1917 it formed part of Fourth Army in 'quiet sectors' (though the brigade commander was wounded in September that year) and taking part in some minor operations along the Flanders coast. In 1918 the division became part of IV Corps in Third Army, in which it remained for the rest of the war. During the German Army's Spring Offensive (Operation Michael or the First Battles of the Somme 1918), the troops of 42nd Division took part in the Battle of Bapaume (24‚Äì25 March), First Battle of Arras (28 March) and the Battle of Ancre (5 April). Then, during the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, it participated in the Battle of Albert (21‚Äì23 August) and the Second Battle of Bapaume (31 August‚Äì3 September) during the fighting on the Somme. When the Hindenburg Line was breached during the Battle of the Canal du Nord on 27 September, 126th Brigade was holding the forward outpost line, but withdrew before Zero Hour for the rest of 42nd Division to attack through it. 125th Brigade's attack was only partially successful, but the advance was renewed after dark, and the following afternoon 126th Brigade passed through 127th to take Welsh ridge, the final objective.Edmonds, pp. 44‚Äì8. Third Army's advance in Picardy culminated in the Battle of the Selle on 20 October. On 42nd Division's front, 1/5th East Lancashires (with its band playing) and 1/10th Manchesters of 126th Brigade led the attack over footbridges laid by the engineers over the River Selle. The Official History records that 'Very fierce fighting took place on the strongly held railway line, and it was two and a half hours before it was finally mopped up by the companies detailed for the purpose. The portion to the north of the attack up to the edge of Solesmes was dealt with by a company of the Manchester'. The rest of the division then moved on towards the final objective.Edmonds, pp. 338‚Äì9. After the Selle, 42nd Division was withdrawn into reserve and halted around Beauvois-en-Cambr√©sis from 24 October until the advance was resumed on 3 November. On 7 November the 42nd Division was tasked to take the high ground west of Hautmont and if possible to capture the town. The division was held up by enfilade fire from the right, and 126th Brigade did no more than occupy some of the high ground. 125th Brigade was therefore ordered to pass through it the next morning and advance to the objective. But the 126th, 'in an endeavour to atone for its slowness on the 7th', pushed on and reached Hautmont before 125th could catch up.Edmonds, p. 510. By 10 November the most forward troops were on the Maubeuge‚ÄìAvesnes-sur-Helpe road. This was the end of the fighting, because the Armistice with Germany came into the effect the following day. In December the division moved into quarters in the Charleroi area and by mid-March 1919 most of its troops had gone home for demobilisation. Between the wars The division and brigade were both disbanded shortly after the end of the war, along with the rest of the Territorial Force. However, in the 1920s, the TF was reformed as the Territorial Army and both the 42nd Division and the 126th (East Lancashire) Infantry Brigade were themselves also reformed, with the brigade including the same battalions as it had before the First World War. However, the brigade's order of battle saw many changes over the years: in 1921 the 4th and 5th battalions of the East Lancashire Regiment were amalgamated into the 4th/5th Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment. The 9th Battalion, Manchester Regiment was transferred to the 127th (Manchester) Infantry Brigade, of the 42nd Division, and the brigade received the 4th (Westmorland) and 5th (Cumberland) battalions of the Border Regiment in exchange, both of which had previously been attached to the division, but not part of it, as Army Troops. The 10th Battalion, Manchester Regiment became a battalion of the Royal Tank Regiment in 1938, becoming the 41st (Oldham) Royal Tank Regiment, later to serve with the 24th Army Tank Brigade. In the same year, the 4th/5th Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment transferred to the 127th Brigade and received the 5th Battalion, King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) in return, previously from the 164th (North Lancashire) Infantry Brigade, of the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division. Sometime in 1939, the brigade was redesignated as the 126th Infantry Brigade. Second World War The 42nd Division, along with the rest of the Territorial Army, was mobilised in late August 1939, and days later the German Army launched its invasion of Poland. When the Second World War began, on 3 September 1939, the 126th Infantry Brigade was once again fully mobilised and embodied for full-time war service as a 1st Line Territorial Army brigade and the units were soon brought up to their War Establishment strength as some, in particular the 5th Battalion, King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster), were under-strength. Soon after mobilisation, the 4th Battalion, Border Regiment was posted away to become part of 25th Infantry Brigade on lines of communications duties in France. They were replaced by the 1st Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment, a Regular Army unit that had been stationed in Northern Ireland, under command of Northern Ireland District. The brigade and the rest of the division then began training for war, although, with most of the British Army at the time, with obsolete tactics in trench warfare dating from the 1914-1918 war. Order of battle The 126th Infantry Brigade was constituted as follows during the war:Joslen, p. 311. * 5th Battalion, King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) * 4th Battalion, Border Regiment (left 29 October 1939, to 25th Brigade) * 5th Battalion, Border Regiment * 1st Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment (joined 10 November 1939, left to 127th Brigade 8 September 1941) * 126th Infantry Brigade Anti-Tank Company (formed 20 January 1940, disbanded 21 January 1941) * 5th Battalion, Manchester Regiment (from 127th Brigade 8 September 1941) Commanders The following officers commanded 126th Infantry Brigade during the war: * Brigadier E.G. Darwell (until 13 January 1940) * Brigadier E.G. Miles (from 13 January until 20 September 1940) * Brigadier L. Bootle-Wilbraham (from 20 September 1940 until 22 September 1941) * Brigadier H.L. Birks (from 22 September 1941) France and Dunkirk Captain Harold Marcus-Ervine Andrews VC. The 126th Infantry Brigade, under the command of Brigadier Eric Miles DSO MC-a tough but highly competent Regular Army officer of the King's Own Scottish Borderers, with the nickname of \\"Miles the soldier\\"-landed, with most of the rest of the division, in France on 15 April 1940 to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Franco-Belgian border. The 42nd Division, led by Major- General William Holmes DSO, came under command of III Corps, serving alongside the 5th Division, a Regular Army formation, and the 44th (Home Counties) Division, a Territorial. The latter division had, along with the 42nd, initially been held back from reinforcing the BEF sooner to participate in potential operations in Northern Europe, although this plan had never come to fruition and both were sent overseas in the same month.Fraser, p. 30. During the Battle of France in May 1940 42nd Division helped to hold the line of the River Escaut and the canals, until, with the rest of the BEF, it was forced to withdraw to Dunkirk. When most of the 42nd Division was evacuated from Dunkirk, 126th Brigade remained behind, transferring to the 1st Division for the final part of the battle and only being evacuated on 2 June. After arriving back in England the brigade rejoined the 42nd Division, then serving in Northern Command. During the evacuation Captain Marcus Ervine-Andrews, Officer Commanding (OC) B Company of the 1st Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment, was awarded the regiment's, the brigade and division's first and only Victoria Cross of the war. He was also the first of eight Irish military personnel to be awarded the VC throughout the Second World War. After returning to England, the brigade was reorganised and, due to the very heavy losses sustained in France, absorbed large numbers of conscripted men as replacements, most of whom had no prior military experience, and was tasked mainly with coastal and home defence and training in an anti-invasion role to repel a potential German invasion of England. The invasion never arrived, mainly due to events that happened during the Battle of Britain in the summer of 1940, and the brigade was able to begin training for offensive operations. Conversion On 1 November 1941, the 42nd Division was converted into 42nd Armoured Division, and 126th Brigade was converted into and redesignated 11th Armoured Brigade. Its infantry battalions became tank regiments of the Royal Armoured Corps as 107th Regiment RAC (King's Own) (previously 5th King's Own), 110th Regiment RAC (Border Regiment) (formerly 5th Borders) and 111th Regiment RAC (Manchester Regiment) (5th Manchesters, transferred from 127th Brigade, replacing 1st East Lancs).Joslen, pp. 165, 311.

It was assigned to the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division and served in the Middle East and on the Western Front in the First World War. In the Second World War, as the 127th Infantry Brigade, it fought in France and was evacuated at Dunkirk. Once back in the United Kingdom, the brigade was converted into an armoured support group. Throughout its existence the brigade was composed mainly of battalions of the Manchester Regiment. Early history The Volunteer Force of part-time soldiers was created following an invasion scare in 1859, and its constituent Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) were progressively aligned with the Regular British Army and Militia during the later 19th Century. Under the 'Localisation of the Forces' introduced by the Cardwell Reforms, existing RVCs were brigaded with Regular and Militia regiments in their district. Sub- District No 16 (Lancashire) formed in 1873 included the 63rd and 96th Regiments, the 6th Royal Lancashire Militia, the 4th and 7th Administrative Battalions of Lancashire RVCs and the 6th (1st Manchester), 33rd (Ardwick), 40th (3rd Manchester) and 56th (Salford) Lancashire RVCs, all from the Manchester, Salford and Ashton-under-Lyne area.Dunlop, p. 4.Spiers, pp. 195‚Äì8. The 1881 Childers Reforms took Cardwell's scheme a stage further, the linked battalions converting into single two-battalion regiments. The 63rd and 96th were amalgamated to create the Manchester Regiment, and the Manchester and Ashton RVCs were formally attached to it as its 1st‚Äì5th Volunteer Battalions.Army List.Rupert Bonner, 'The Development of the Rifle Volunteer Movement in Manchester', Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, 2008, Vol 86, No 347, pp. 216‚Äì35.Dunlop, p. 5.Lancashire Record Office Handlist 72Westlake, pp. 141‚Äì50. While the sub-districts were later referred to as 'brigades', they were purely administrative organisations and the Volunteers were excluded from the mobilisation part of the Cardwell system. But under the reforms introduced by Edward Stanhope in 1888, a comprehensive Mobilisation Scheme was brought in for Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own Volunteer Infantry Brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these brigades provided a structure for collective training.Beckett, pp. 135, 185‚Äì6.Dunlop, pp. 60‚Äì1.Spiers, pp. 228‚Äì9. The five (later six) Volunteer Battalions of the Manchester Regiment constituted the Manchester Brigade, based at 55 Market Street, Manchester, and initially under the command of retired Colonel H.B.H. Blundell. Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908, the Volunteer Battalions became the 5th‚Äì10th Battalions of the Manchester Regiment.Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. The Manchester Brigade comprised the 5th‚Äì8th Battalions and formed part of the East Lancashire Division of the TF:Becke, pp. 35‚Äì41.Division at Long, Long Trail.Division at Regimental Warpath. * 5th Battalion, Manchester Regiment (from Wigan) * 6th Battalion, Manchester Regiment (from Hulme) * 7th Battalion, Manchester Regiment (from Manchester) * 8th Battalion, Manchester Regiment (from Ardwick) First World War On the outbreak of the First World War, the majority of the men volunteered for overseas service. On 31 August 1914, the formation of Reserve or 2nd Line units was authorised for each TF unit going overseas. Initially these were formed from men who had not volunteered for overseas service, and the recruits who were flooding in. Later they were mobilised for overseas service in their own right. From now on, the original battalions and brigades were designated with a '1/' prefix and the 2nd Line duplicate by a '2/'. Eventually the 2nd Manchester Brigade went overseas as the 199th (Manchester) Brigade.Manchester Rgt at Long, Long TrailManchester Rgt at Regimental Warpath.'Territorial Force 1914‚Äì1919' at Museum of the Manchester Regiment.Gibbon, pp. 4‚Äì5.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 67‚Äì74. The East Lancashire Division embarked at Southampton and sailed for Egypt on 10 September 1914, the first complete TF division to leave England for foreign service. The division began disembarking at Alexandria on 25 September and the bulk (including the Manchester Brigade) concentrated at Cairo.Gibbon, pp. 6‚Äì7. Order of battle During the war, the Manchester Brigade was constituted as follows: * 1/5th Battalion, Manchester Regiment * 1/6th Battalion, Manchester Regiment * 1/7th Battalion, Manchester Regiment * 1/8th Battalion, Manchester Regiment (left for 126th Brigade February 1918) * 127th Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps (formed 14 March 1916, moved to 42nd Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 23 February 1918) * 127th Trench Mortar Battery (joined 26 March 1917)http://www.1914-1918.net/mg_units.htm When British infantry brigades were reduced to three battalions in February 1918, 1/8th Manchesters transferred to 126th Brigade in 42nd Division. At the same time, the machine gun company left to join a new divisional machine gun battalion. Commanders The following officers commanded the East Lancashire Brigade during the war: * Brigadier-General N. Lee (wounded 4 June 1915) * Lieutenant Colonel Lord Rochdale (acting) * Brigadier-General Hon. Sir H.A. Lawrence (from 21 June 1915)http://heritagearchives.rbs.com/wiki/Herbert_Lawrence * Brigadier-General G.S.McD. Elliot (from 22 September 1915) * Brigadier-General V.A. Ormsby (from 1 Mar 1916, killed 2 May 1917) * Brigadier-General Hon. A.M. Henley (from 5 May 1917) Egypt and Gallipoli The East Lancashire Division remained in Egypt training and manning the Suez Canal defences until 1 May 1915 when it embarked at Alexandria for Gallipoli. The Manchester Brigade first went into action at the Third Battle of Krithia. In late May 1915 the division was numbered as 42nd (East Lancashire) Division ‚Äì taking the lowest number of any TF division in recognition that it was the first to go overseas ‚Äì and the brigades were also numbered, the Manchester becoming 127th (1st Manchester) Brigade. The battalions adopted the prefix '1/' (becoming 1/5th Manchesters, for example) to distinguish them from their 2nd Line duplicates then training in the United Kingdom as the 199th (2/1st Manchester) Brigade in 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division. The 127th Brigade participated in the Battle of Krithia Vineyard (6‚Äì13 August) and then for the rest of 1915 was engaged in trench warfare. After the evacuation from Gallipoli, the division returned to Egypt in January 1916 with less than half the strength with which it had set out. It remained in the Canal Defences for the whole of 1916, rebuilding its strength, and taking part in the Battle of Romani (4‚Äì5 August). Western Front In January 1917, 42nd Division was ordered to France, the move being completed by mid-March. It spent the remainder of the war on the Western Front. During 1917 it formed part of Fourth Army in 'quiet sectors' (though the brigade commander was killed in May that year) and taking part in some minor operations along the Flanders coast. In 1918 the 42nd Division became part of IV Corps in Third Army, in which it remained for the rest of the war. During the German Army's Spring Offensive (Operation Michael or the First Battles of the Somme 1918), the troops of 42nd Division took part in the Battle of Bapaume (24‚Äì25 March), First Battle of Arras (28 March) and the Battle of Ancre (5 April). Then, during the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, it participated in the Battle of Albert (21‚Äì23 August) and the Second Battle of Bapaume (31 August‚Äì3 September) during the fighting on the Somme. When the Hindenburg Line was breached during the Battle of the Canal du Nord on 27 September 1918, 127th Brigade's attack was completely successful. The rest of 42nd Division then passed through to continue the attack. 125th Brigade's follow-up was only partially successful, but the advance was renewed after dark, and the following afternoon 126th Brigade passed through 127th to take Welsh ridge, the final objective.Edmonds, pp. 44‚Äì8. Third Army's advance in Picardy culminated in the Battle of the Selle on 20 October.126th Brigade led the division's attack over footbridges laid by the engineers over the River Selle. 1/5th and 1/6th Manchesters of 127th Brigade then followed up to an intermediate objective. The division then had to wheel right, and was held up. But in the afternoon the attack was resumed and 127th Brigade pushed on to the final objective, which 1/6th Manchesters took after dark without much difficulty.Edmonds, pp. 338‚Äì9. After the Selle, 42nd Division was withdrawn into reserve and halted around Beauvois-en-Cambr√©sis from 24 October until the advance was resumed on 3 November. On 7 November the 42nd Division captured Hautmont and the high ground to its west.Edmonds, p. 510. By 10 November the most forward troops of 42nd Division were on the Maubeuge‚ÄìAvesnes-sur-Helpe road. This was the end of the fighting, because the Armistice with Germany came into the effect the following day. In December the division moved into quarters in the Charleroi area and by mid-March 1919 most of its troops had gone home for demobilisation. Between the wars The Territorial Force was disbanded after the war as was the brigade and the 42nd Division but both were reconstituted in the Territorial Army, which was formed on a similar basis as the Territorial Force. The brigade reformed as the 127th (Manchester) Infantry Brigade with the same units as it had before the First World War, with all four battalions of the Manchester Regiment. However, the 6th and 7th Manchesters were merged, in 1921, to create the 6th/7th Battalion, Manchester Regiment. To fill the gap left by the absence of the 7th Battalion, the 9th Battalion, Manchester Regiment was transferred from the 126th (East Lancashire) Infantry Brigade and this remained the structure of the brigade until 1936. In the late 1930s the United Kingdom's air defences were greatly increased, mainly by converting a number of infantry battalions of the Territorial Army into anti-aircraft or searchlight units of the Royal Artillery or Royal Engineers. As a result, in 1936, the 6th/7th Battalion, Manchester Regiment was transferred to the Royal Artillery and became 65th (The Manchester Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, Royal Artillery,'Territorial Force 1939‚Äì1967' at Museum of the Manchester Regiment. joining the 33rd (Western) Anti-Aircraft Group, 2nd Anti-Aircraft Division. In 1938 a further reorganisation of the composition of Territorial divisions saw them reduced from four to three infantry battalions and so the 9th Battalion, Manchester Regiment left the brigade to become the machine gun battalion for the 42nd Division. They were replaced by the 4th/5th Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment from the 126th (East Lancashire) Infantry Brigade. Shortly afterwards, in 1939, the brigade was redesignated the 127th Infantry Brigade. Second World War The brigade was mobilised, along with the rest of 42nd Division and the Territorial Army, in late August 1939 due to the worsening situation in Europe. On 1 September 1939 the German Army launched its invasion of Poland. The Second World War began on 3 September 1939, and 127th Infantry Brigade was embodied for full-time war service and all units were soon brought up to full strength. Order of battle The 127th Infantry Brigade was constituted as follows during the war:Joslen, p. 312. * 4th Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment * 5th Battalion, Manchester Regiment (transferred to 126th Brigade 8 September 1941) * 8th (Ardwick) Battalion, Manchester Regiment (left 6 May 1940) * 127th Infantry Brigade Anti-Tank Company (formed 2 February 1940, disbanded 24 January 1941) * 1st Battalion, Highland Light Infantry (from 6 May 1940 until 31 October 1941) * 2nd Battalion, Durham Light Infantry (8 September ‚Äì 19 October 1941) * 1st Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment (from 126th Brigade 25 to 31 October 1941) Commanders The following officers commanded 127th Infantry Brigade during the war: * Brigadier V.T.R. Ford (until 16 November 1939) * Lieutenant Colonel G.S. Kay (Acting, from 16 to 24 November 1939) * Brigadier K.J. Martin (from 24 November 1939 until 25 January 1940) * Lieutenant Colonel J.W. Pendlebury (Acting, from 25 January to 5 February 1940) * Brigadier J.G. Smyth, VC (from 5 February 1940 until 2 April 1941) * Brigadier R.C. Matthews (from 2 April until 25 October 1941) * Lieutenant Colonel V.S. Laurie (Acting, from 25 to 28 October 1941) * Brigadier C.C.G. Nicholson (from 28 October 1941) France and Dunkirk Commanded at the time by Brigadier Sir John George Smyth, VC, an Indian Army officer, the 127th Infantry Brigade landed in France on 24 April 1940 and became part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). The 42nd Division came under command of III Corps, which also included 5th Infantry Division and 44th (Home Counties) Division. The 44th had, along with the 42nd Division, initially been held back from joining the BEF sooner for potential operations in Northern Europe although, as it turned out, this plan never came to anything and both were sent to France at around the same time.Fraser, p. 30. Soon after arrival the 8th (Ardwick) Battalion, Manchester Regiment were sent on to Malta (one of many British Army garrisons around the Empire) and the brigade received the 1st Battalion, Highland Light Infantry, a Regular Army unit, in exchange. The battalion had arrived from Highland Area in Scottish Command and joined in order to strengthen the brigade, as part of the BEF's official policies, and took place in all the 1st Line Territorial divisions that joined the BEFFraser, p. 28. (except the three 2nd Line divisions that arrived in April and were subsequently mauled in the fighting to come). When the German attack on France and the Low Countries of Belgium and the Netherlands began on 10 May 1940, 127th Brigade was assigned to 'Macforce', a scratch force commanded by the Director of Military Intelligence with the BEF, Lieutenant-General Noel Mason-Macfarlane. Macforce assembled on 17 May with the role of covering the crossings over the River ScarpeLord Gort's despatch, London Gazette, Supplement 10 October 1941. As German pressure increased, the BEF was forced to withdraw to Dunkirk and 127th Brigade returned to 42nd Division on 20 May. It was evacuated from Dunkirk on 30 May. Conversion On 1 November 1941, 42nd Division was converted into 42nd Armoured Division, and 127th Brigade was renamed 42nd Support Group. Apart from 1st Battalion, East Lancashires, its infantry battalions were replaced by artillery regiments. On 1 June 1942 the support group was disbanded, its headquarters becoming the Royal Artillery HQ for the division.Joslen, p. 222.

The dispute led to nationwide protests, television appeals and debates in D√°il √âireann. According to the trade union UNITE, the dispute was part of a growing trend of workers being \\"left in the cold\\" after being made redundant. The staff had worked for a total of 847 years for Vita Cortex, with the most senior employee having worked there for 47 years. The strike received support from, among others, the Cork senior hurling team, former President of Ireland Mary Robinson, human rights campaigner Noam Chomsky, international soccer player Paul McGrath, musician Christy Moore, film and theatre actor Cillian Murphy, and Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson. The 160-day sit-in was ended in May 2012, after the workers started receiving redundancy payments. Timeline December Vita Cortex Industries produced foam for the furniture and packaging industries. On 15 December 2011, staff were told that the company was to close the following day, and that they would be made redundant with no financial recompense. Vita Cortex Industries blamed the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) for the situation. On 16 December, workers began a sit-in at the plant. The sit-in was non-stop, with workers sleeping overnight throughout. Members of the public provided food to the workers and offered shower facilities. The sit-in continued over Christmas and into the new year. Lord Mayor of Cork Terry Shannon and a delegation from SIPTU visited the workers during December 2011. January The workers were interviewed on The Late Late Show on 6 January 2012. Christy Moore later said that watching this moved him to perform a show in solidarity with the workers. On 11 January 2012, the Labour Relations Commission (LRC) intervened. That day also saw Cork senior hurling coach Jimmy Barry Murphy visit the workers to present them with a signed Cork hurling jersey and pledge the support of him and his team for the workers. On 12 January, hundreds of people, including Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton, protested outside Leinster House in Dublin, in solidarity with the redundant workers. Hundreds of people also protested in Cork two days later. On 19 January 2012, linguist and human rights campaigner Noam Chomsky sent an e-mail message \\"to the workers of Vita Cortex, Cork, Ireland\\" in which he commended their \\"courageous and honourable actions\\". Former President of Ireland Mary Robinson also sent her support, writing: \\"I have always supported the right of workers to be treated fairly. I sympathise with your desire and that of your co-workers to get a fair deal.\\" February On 11 February 2012, thousands of people marched through Cork city centre in solidarity with the Vita Cortex workers, and on 13 February, Sir Alex Ferguson telephoned Jim Power to express his support, drawing parallels to his involvement in an apprentice boys‚Äô strike in Glasgow in 1961. On 17 February, musician Christy Moore performed a sell-out show in the Triskel Arts Centre in support of the sit-in. He dedicated his song \\"Ordinary Man\\" to the workers, calling their treatment \\"obscene\\". On 18 February, soccer international Paul McGrath visited the factory to declare his support. February also saw Hollywood actor Cillian Murphy declare his support, writing about his \\"admiration to you all for the courage and commitment you are displaying in your sit-in. To everyone following this situation from the outside it is more than clear that you have right on your side and that what you are highlighting is hugely important to us all as a nation\\". March On the morning of 2 March 2012, a delegation of former Vita Cortex workers met T√°naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Eamon Gilmore at a hotel in Cork city. Henry O'Reilly, a grandfather and Vita Cortex worker for more than 40 years, was reported to have been diagnosed with liver, spleen and pancreatic cancer. His cancer diagnosis came after he contracted suspected pneumonia while protesting for better conditions at the freezing Vita Cortex plant. March also saw the protest reach 100 days. More than 100 family members and friends of the former Vita Cortex workers gathered in the factory canteen and a Mass was celebrated. April The workers blocked the factory gates to stop trucks making deliveries and collections to and from a sister business, Vita Clean, on the same site. They later decided to open the gates after consulting with SIPTU officials. May The 160-day sit-in was ended in May 2012, after the workers started receiving redundancy payments. The workers were later received by President Michael D. Higgins at √Åras an Uachtar√°in.

The brigade saw active service in both World War I and World War II with the 52nd (Lowland) Division. Origins The Scottish Rifles Brigade was originally a Volunteer Infantry Brigade formed in 1902 when the former Glasgow Brigade of the Volunteer Force was split up. The four Volunteer Battalions of the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) constituted one brigade, while the four Volunteer Battalions of the Highland Light Infantry formed the other (the Highland Light Infantry Brigade, later the 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade of the TF).Army List, various dates. From 1902 to 1908 the Scottish Rifles Brigade had the following composition: * 1st Lanarkshire Volunteer Rifle Corps at 128 West Princes Street, Glasgow * 2nd Volunteer Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) at Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, * 3rd Lanarkshire Volunteer Rifle Corps at Victoria Road, Glasgow * 4th Volunteer Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) at 138 Stirling Road, Glasgow * Bearer Company, Royal Army Medical Corps, later an Army Service Corps Company The Brigade Headquarters (HQ) was at 149 Cathedral Street, Glasgow, and the brigade commander from 1 June 1906 was retired Colonel E.C. Browne. Territorial Force After the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the Scottish Rifles Brigade formed part of the Lowland Division of the TF with the following composition:Thompson, pp. 3‚Äì5.London Gazette, 20 March 1908.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 109‚Äì15.52 (L) Division at Long, Long Trail.Cameronians at Long, Log Trail.Conrad, British Army, 1914. * 5th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), at Glasgow * 6th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), at Muirhall, Hamilton * 7th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), at Victoria Road, Glasgow * 8th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), at Cathedral Street, Glasgow First World War The Lowland Division was mobilised for full-time war service in early August 1914, and most of the men, when asked, volunteered for overseas service. From November 1914 to March 1915, many units of the division were posted elsewhere, mainly to reinforce the Regular Army divisions of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front, most of which had suffered heavy casualties. The 5th and 6th battalions of the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) were sent to the Western Front and replaced by the 4th and 7th battalions of the Royal Scots. In May 1915 the division was numbered as the 52nd (Lowland) Division and the brigades were also numbered, the Scottish Rifles Brigade becoming 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade and the battalions were redesignated, becoming '1/7th Royal Scots', to distinguish them from their 2nd Line units being formed in the 195th (2/1st Scottish Rifles) Brigade, part of the 65th (2nd Lowland) Division. During the war the brigade served with the division in the Middle Eastern theatre, fighting in 1917 in the Battle of Romani, the First Battle of Gaza, Second Battle of Gaza and Third Battle of Gaza during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign and, in 1918, served on the Western Front, fighting in the Hundred Days Offensive. Order of battle * 1/5th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) (to November 1914) * 1/6th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) (left March 1915) * 1/7th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) * 1/8th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) (left 28 June 1918) * 1/4th (Queen's Edinburgh Rifles) Battalion, Royal Scots (from April 1915) * 1/7th Battalion, Royal Scots (from April 1915) * 156th Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps (formed 16 March 1916, moved to 52nd Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 28 April 1918) * 156th Trench Mortar Battery (formed 27 June 1917) Between the wars After the war the brigade and division were disbanded as was the whole of the Territorial Force. The Territorial Force was reformed in the 1920s as the Territorial Army (TA) and the 52nd Division was reconstituted as was the brigade which was redesignated as the 156th (Scottish Rifles) Infantry Brigade with the same unit it had pre-war. In 1921, the 5th and 8th Battalions of the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) were amalgamated as the 5th/8th Battalion and were replaced by the 4th/5th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers from the 155th (East Scottish) Infantry Brigade. Shortly after, the brigade was redesignated the 156th (West Scottish) Infantry Brigade. In the late 1930s many of the Territorial Army's infantry battalions were converted into other roles, mainly anti-aircraft and searchlight units. In late 1938, all British infantry brigades were reduced from four to three battalions and the 5th/8th Cameronians was chosen to be converted and became 5th/8th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) (56th Searchlight Regiment). In 1939 the brigade was redesignated 156th Infantry Brigade. Second World War Sherman and a Churchill tank during the 52nd Division's attack towards Stein from Tuddern, 18 January 1945. During the Second World War, the brigade served with the division during Operation Ariel in 1940 in France to cover the withdrawal of troops of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) which was being evacuated from France. From May 1942 to June 1944 the division was trained in mountain warfare yet were never used in the role. They were then trained in airlanding operations but were again never utilised in this role either, due mainly to the disastrous events that occurred during the Battle of Arnhem where the British 1st Airborne Division was virtually destroyed. In October 1944 the 52nd Division was sent to the Western Front to join the 21st Army Group and were attached to the First Canadian Army and fought in the Battle of the Scheldt where the 52nd Division gained an excellent reputation. The 156th Infantry Brigade, with the 52nd, took part in Operation Blackcock in early 1945, later taking part in the Western Allied invasion of Germany, and ended the war by the River Elbe. During Blackcock, Fusilier Dennis Donnini of the 4th/5th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. At the age of 19, he was the youngest British or Commonwealth soldier to be awarded the VC during the Second World War.

Macdonald in Glasgow in 1902, and initially provided design and construction in ferro- concrete (reinforced concrete) using a system patented by French engineer, Fran√ßois Hennebique. Significant early projects included the Usher Hall in Edinburgh.Fairhurst: Our history and profile - http://www.fairhurst.co.uk/Fairhurst_History_&_Profile.shtml William Fairhurst joined the company in 1931, having established his reputation as a civil and structural engineer, and became a director in 1938 and managing director in 1941. The firm, meanwhile, began to expand its network of offices, both organically and through acquisition, opening Scottish bases in Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Dundee and Elgin, and then English offices in places including Newcastle, Leeds, London (from 1982 to 1997, the company was project manager for the implementation of the engineering infrastructure for the London Docklands Development Corporation) and Bristol. Overseas project offices were also established at various times. However, a domestic project awarded in 1959, the new Tay Road Bridge, crossing the Tay estuary and linking north-east Fife with Dundee, proved pivotal in the firm's development, and the key involvement of Fairhurst led the business to change its name to W. A. Fairhurst and Partners. Fairhurst retired in 1971, by which time the business had delivered another major Scottish bridge: the Kingston Bridge, Glasgow (1970).

Assigned to the 52nd (Lowland) Division, the brigade saw active service in the Middle East and on the Western Front during the First World War. During the Second World War, now the 155th Infantry Brigade, it continued to serve with the 52nd Division in Operation Dynamo, and later in North-western Europe from late 1944 until May 1945. Origins The Scottish Border Brigade (originally the South of Scotland Brigade) was a Volunteer Infantry Brigade of the British Army formed in 1888. The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle, Artillery and Engineer Volunteer units composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Spiers, pp. 163‚Äì8. The Stanhope Memorandum of 1888 proposed a comprehensive Mobilisation Scheme for Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime, these brigades provided a structure for collective training.Beckett, pp. 135, 185‚Äì6.Dunlop, pp. 60‚Äì1. Under this scheme the Volunteer Battalions in the Scottish Border areas would assemble at Hawick.Army List, various dates. From 1888, the South of Scotland/Scottish Border Brigade had the following composition: * 1st Roxburgh and Selkirk (The Border) Rifle Volunteer Corps, with the 1st Roxburgh Mounted Rifles Volunteers attached, at Newtown St Boswells * 2nd (Berwickshire) Volunteer Battalion, Kings Own Scottish Borderers, at Duns * 3rd (Dumfries) Volunteer Battalion, Kings Own Scottish Borderers, at Dumfries * Galloway Volunteer Rifle Corps at Castle Douglas * 2nd (Angus) Volunteer Battalion, The Royal Highlanders (Black Watch), at Arbroath * 5th (Perthshire) Volunteer Battalion, The Royal Highlanders (Black Watch), at Birnham * Supply Detachment, Army Service Corps * Bearer Company, Army Hospital Corps (later Royal Army Medical Corps) In the early 1890s, the two Black Watch battalions were replaced by: * 6th Volunteer Battalion, Royal Scots, at Penicuik * 7th Volunteer Battalion, Royal Scots, at Haddington After a further reorganisation in 1902, the 1st and 2nd VBs of the Royal Scots Fusiliers (at Kilmarnock and Ayr respectively) replaced the two battalions of the Royal Scots. The Brigade Headquarters (HQ) and place of assembly was at Hawick and Colonel Viscount Melgund (later 4th Earl of Minto) was appointed brigade commander on 11 July 1888. From 1900, the brigade commander was the Officer Commanding the 25th Regimental District (the KOSB district) at Berwick-upon-Tweed, then from 1906 it was commanded by retired Colonel P.D. Trotter. Territorial Force After the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the South Scottish Brigade (as it was now designated) formed part of the Lowland Division of the TF with the following composition:Thompson, pp. 3‚Äì5.London Gazette, 20 March 1908.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 109‚Äì15.52 (L) Division at Long, Long Trail.RSF at Long, Long Trail.KOSB at Long, Long Trail.Conrad, British Army, 1914. * 4th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers, at Kilmarnock * 5th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers, at Ayr * 4th (Border) Battalion, Kings Own Scottish Borderers (from 1st Roxburgh & Selkirk VRC and 2nd VB), at Galashiels * 5th (Dumfries & Galloway) Battalion, Kings Own Scottish Borderers (from 3rd VB and Galloway VRC), at Dumfries First World War On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the Lowland Division was mobilised for full-time war service. In 1915, the division was numbered as the 52nd (Lowland) Division and the brigade the 155th (1/1st South Scottish) Brigade and the battalions received the '1/' prefix (1/4th Royal Royal Scots Fusiliers) to distinguish them from their 2nd Line units being formed as the 194th (2/1st South Scottish) Brigade, part of 65th (2nd Lowland) Division. During the First World War the brigade served in the Middle Eastern theatre and later on the Western Front.

The Territorial Force was, however, reformed in 1920 as the Territorial Army and the 52nd Division was reconstituted as was the brigade, which was redesignated as the 155th (South Scottish) Infantry Brigade. The brigade was reformed with the same units as it had before the First World War. In 1921, the 4th and 5th battalions of the Royal Scots Fusiliers were amalgamated into the 4th/5th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers and it was later transferred to the 156th (Scottish Rifles) Infantry Brigade, later redesignated 156th (West Scottish) Infantry Brigade. The 155th Brigade later received the 4th/5th (Queen's Edinburgh Rifles) Battalion, Royal Scots (the amalgamated 4th and 5th battalions) and the 7th/9th (Highlanders) Battalion, Royal Scots (the amalgamated 7th and 9th) both arrived from 156th Brigade and was redesignated 155th (East Scottish) Infantry Brigade. In the late 1930s, there was an increasing need for anti-aircraft defences throughout Britain and many infantry battalions were converted into anti-aircraft or searchlight units of the Royal Artillery or Royal Engineers. In 1938, all infantry brigades of the British Army were reduced from four to three battalions and, in the same year, the 4th/5th Battalion, Royal Scots was converted into an anti-aircraft role, becoming the 4th/5th Battalion, Royal Scots (52nd Searchlight Regiment). In 1939 the brigade was finally redesignated 155th Infantry Brigade. Second World War During the Second World War, the 155th Infantry Brigade served with the 52nd Division during Operation Ariel in France in 1940 to cover the withdrawal of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) which was being evacuated from France. The 52nd Division was itself evacuated from France on 17 June 1940, and spent many years on anti-invasion duties, training to repel an expected German invasion of Britain. From May 1942 to June 1944, the division was trained in mountain warfare yet was never used in the role. They were then trained in airlanding operations but were, again, never utilised in the role. In October 1944, they were sent to Belgium as a standard infantry division to join the 21st Army Group and were attached to First Canadian Army and fought in the Battle of the Scheldt where the 52nd Division gained an excellent reputation. The brigade was attached to 7th Armoured Division during Operation Blackcock in 1945 and ended the war by the River Elbe.

Dimensions Built by Fairfields at Govan in 1891, Tynwald was the first Isle of Man Steam Packet Company vessel fitted with a triple-expansion engine. She was launched on Monday, 11 May 1891; for the first time in the Company's history the builders' specification included full installation of electric lighting. Tynwald had a certificate for 679 first class passengers and 225 third, a total of 904, and a crew of 50. Tynwald had a registered tonnage (GRT) of 937. Length 265 feet (81 metres) between perpendiculars; beam 34 feet (10 metres); depth 14 feet; and a speed of 18 knots. Her two boilers had a steam pressure of 160 PSI (1.1 megapascals) and each boiler was fired by eight furnaces. She had bunker capacity of 120 tons of coal. The two sets of triple-expansion engines developed 3,800 indicated horsepower (equivalent to 2.8 megawatts) at 120 rpm. Service life Tynwald made her first appearance in Douglas on 27 June 1891. Fast for her size, she could hold her own with the . In 1900 when racing with the Queen Victoria against an opposition steamer the Lily, Tynwald arrived at Liverpool four minutes ahead of the Queen Victoria and eleven minutes ahead of the Lily. Tynwald was designed and built as a winter vessel on the Douglas - Liverpool service, and in the summer on general duties which included the newly introduced Douglas ‚Äî Ardrossan run. In July 1912, she inaugurated a service from Douglas and Ramsey to Whitehaven In September 1892, went aground at Scarlett Point, Castletown, while rounding the south of the Island, homeward bound from Dublin.Tynwald lends assistance to Mona's Isle which had run aground at Scarlett Point, September 1892She was fast aground for two days, and was re-floated after assistance from Tynwald, her passengers having previously been landed onto the rocks by way of a rather precarious ladder from her bows. On 6 April 1893, while at anchor in the Mersey, she was run into by the steamer Lotus and extensively damaged. In 1912, she opened a service from Douglas to Whitehaven calling at Ramsey, and was also used as a winter vessel on the main home run. First World War Tynwald did not serve as a military vessel during the First World War, but instead, continued as a commercial vessel. In 1914 she carried the first German prisoners of war to the Island for internment at Knockaloe.Ships of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company (Fred Henry, 1973) p.19 She shared the Douglas ‚Äî Liverpool home run with throughout the war. Under the command of Capt. Cojeen, she had a number of close encounters with floating mines but was never hit; the minesweepers worked day and night to keep the approaches to Liverpool open. Officers, Engine Room Staff and Deck Crew of Tynwald, 1928. Capt J.J. Qurik (pictured centre). However, on many occasions her sailings had to be postponed, owing to special danger from mines. One of the Liverpool pilot-boats struck a mine just outside the Formby Lightship. The boat was blown to pieces, and some forty lives were lost, including 26 first-class Liverpool pilots. The Tynwald probably passed this mine several times in the course of her usual work. Prince's Landing Stage, Liverpool On 9 April 1917, a German submarine had penetrated to within a few miles of Liverpool and succeeded in torpedoing the American liner . The Tynwald, inward bound from Douglas, was just passing the Bar Light Ship and was quickly on the scene. The weather at the time was far from good, a strong wind blowing with showers of snow at intervals. The passengers were conveyed in the liner's own lifeboats, which came alongside the Tynwald, and, although the sea was distinctly lumpy, causing a considerable rise and fall of the lifeboats, all were safely taken on board, including Admiral Sims of the U.S. Navy. During the transfer of the passengers, three or four patrol steamers and tug-boats came to the liner's assistance. The damage to the was in the fore part of the vessel, and, as the bulkhead abaft where she was struck remained intact, the ship was able to float, although the forward compartments were full of water. The was taken in tow by tugs and eventually docked. On another occasion, Tynwald left Douglas at 14:00hrs, landed her passengers and mails at Liverpool, and then returned to Douglas light. Tynwald then sailed again the next morning at 09:00, and upon arrival at Liverpool, having completed three trips and taken in coal, she was told to return to the Landing Stage with all speed. The Easter Rising had begun in Dublin, and Tynwald was ordered to take a full load of troops to Ireland, and sailed at 19:30hrs. Enemy submarines were very busy at that time in the Irish Sea, but the Tynwald landed her men safely at Kingstown the following morning. On another occasion, having arrived at Liverpool Landing Stage, Tynwald was ordered, after discharging mails and passengers, to take coal as speedily as possible. Upon completion of coaling, she embarked divers and other workmen of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board along with their equipment, and made passage straight back to the Island. Tynwald departing Peel, Isle of Man. News had come through that the White Star steamer had been torpedoed, with the loss of many lives, off the Calf of Man, and was then anchored off Peel, carefully guarded by Destroyers. With all speed the Tynwald proceeded to Peel Breakwater, and there landed the men and their gear. The Celtic was speedily patched up, and taken to Harland and Wolff's works at Belfast. Commerce to and from the Port of Liverpool routinely suffered owing to the port being closed due to perceived enemy activity. On one such occasion, when the Tynwald arrived at the Bar (about 18:45), she had to dodge about with her passengers aboard all that night, and until 19:00hrs the next day, with the constant danger of striking a mine, or of encountering a submarine. The Tynwald continued in service, summer and winter, right through the War, except when undergoing survey and repairs. She came through unscathed. She carried no guns, was never camouflaged, but was painted as usual, black with red funnels. Inter-war period On returning to normal service after the Great War, she was used in excursion runs from Blackpool. These trips usually took in calls at Morecambe, Douglas and Llandudno Tynwald pictured leaving Douglas, Isle of Man. On Friday 13 November 1925, the Tynwald fouled the anchor chain of another vessel as she prepared to berth alongside the Prince‚Äôs Landing Stage. Damage was sustained to the Tynwald's screw as a consequence of which she missed her scheduled sailing to Douglas, requiring the Mona to undertake the schedule. It was intended to scrap her in 1933, but these arrangements were cancelled and she was purchased in 1934 by Mr. R. A. Colby Cubbin for conversion into a private yacht. In 1935 she was renamed Western Isles, but spent several years lying in the King George V Dock, Glasgow. Second World War Western Isles was requisitioned by the Admiralty as an auxiliary in April 1940. On 27 October 1941, she was renamed Eastern Isles and used as an accommodation ship at in Birkenhead until 27 April 1946. Post war Eastern Isles was returned to her owner in 1947 who was faced with an unviable bill for ¬£100,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) in order to put her back into service. Disposal In 1951, Eastern Isles was sold and taken in tow by the tug Airman to Spezia for breaking. She left Birkenhead at 07:30hrs on Wednesday, 13 May 1951.

The brigade fought in both World War I and World War II, assigned to 52nd (Lowland) Division. Origins The Highland Light Infantry Brigade was originally a Volunteer Infantry Brigade formed in 1902 when the former Glasgow Brigade of the Volunteer Force was split up. The four Volunteer Battalions of the Highland Light Infantry constituted one brigade, while the four Volunteer Battalions of the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) formed the other (the Scottish Rifles Brigade Brigade, later the 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade of the TF).Army List, various dates. From 1902 to 1908 the Highland Light Infantry Brigade had the following composition: * 1st Volunteer Battalion, Highland Light Infantry, at 24 Hill Street, Garnethill, Glasgow * 2nd Volunteer Battalion, Highland Light Infantry, at Kelvinhaugh Road, Overnewtown * 3rd (Blythswood) Volunteer Battalion, Highland Light Infantry, at 105 West George Street, Glasgow * 9th Lanarkshire Volunteer Rifle Corps at Lanark * 5th (Glasgow Highland) Volunteer Battalion, Highland Light Infantry, at 81 Greendyke Street, Glasgow * Bearer Company, Royal Army Medical Corps, later an Army Service Corps Company The Brigade Headquarters (HQ) was at Hamilton, later at 2 West Regent Street, Glasgow. Initially the brigade commander was the Officer Commanding the 26th and 71st Regimental Districts (the HLI districts), later it was Colonel R.C. MacKenzie, former commanding officer of the 1st VB, HLI. Territorial Force After the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the Scottish Rifles Brigade formed part of the Lowland Division of the TF with the following composition:Thompson, pp. 3‚Äì5.London Gazette, 20 March 1908.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 109‚Äì15.52 (L) Division at Long, Long Trail.Conrad, British Army, 1914. * 5th (City of Glasgow) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry * 6th (City of Glasgow) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry * 7th (Blythswood) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry * 8th (Lanark) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry First World War Upon the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the Lowland Division was mobilised immediately for full-time war service. In May 1915 the brigade became the 157th (1/1st Highland Light Infantry) Brigade and the division the 52nd (Lowland) Division. The battalions were also redesignated with the '1/' prefix, 1/4th HLI. This was to avoid confusion with the 2nd Line duplicates which were also forming up and training as the 196th (2/1st Highland Light Infantry) Brigade of 65th (2nd Lowland) Division. The 2nd Line units consisted mainly of those few men who did not volunteer for overseas service when asked at the outbreak of war, together with the many recruits, and were intended to act as a reserve for the 1st Line units being sent overseas. During the war the brigade and division served in the Middle East and later on the Western Front. Order of battle First World War * 1/5th (City of Glasgow) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry * 1/6th (City of Glasgow) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry * 1/7th (Blythswood) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry * 1/9th (Glasgow Highlanders) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry (left November 1914) * 1/5th (Renfrewshire) Battalion, Princess Louise's (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) (from April 1915, left 28 June 1918) * 157th Machine Gun Company (formed 14 March 1916, joined 52nd Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 28 April 1918) * 157th Trench Mortar Battery (formed 11 June 1917) Between the wars After the Great War both the brigade and division were disbanded, as was the rest of the Territorial Force which was later renamed in the 1920s as the Territorial Army and the 52nd Division was reconstituted as was the brigade, which became the 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Infantry Brigade, again composed of the 5th, 6th, 7th and 9th battalions of the Highland Light Infantry and remained this way for most of the inter-war period. In 1938, due to an increasing need to strengthen the anti-aircraft defences of the country, the 7th Battalion, HLI was transferred to the Royal Artillery and converted into 83rd (7th (Blythswood) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, Royal Artillery. In the same year the 9th (Glasgow Highland) Battalion was redesignated 1st Battalion, Glasgow Highlanders but still retained the Highland Light Infantry as its parent regiment. In the following year the brigade was redesignated as 157th Infantry Brigade. Second World War Men of the 7th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) use a small boat to cross a canal in the town of Rheine, Germany, 3 April 1945. During the Second World War, the brigade served with the division during Operation Ariel in France in mid-1940 to cover the withdrawal of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) being evacuated from France. In 1942 to June 1944 the division was trained in mountain warfare yet was never used in the role. They were then trained in airlanding operations but were again never utilised in the role. In October 1944 they were sent to Belgium to join the 21st Army Group and were attached to the First Canadian Army and fought in the Battle of the Scheldt. The brigade took part in Operation Blackcock in 1945 and ended the war by the River Elbe. Order of battle The 157th Infantry Brigade was constituted as follows during the war: * 5th Battalion, Highland Light Infantry * 6th Battalion, Highland Light Infantry (to 12 February 1945) * 1st Battalion, Glasgow Highlanders (to 12 March 1945) * 157th Infantry Brigade Anti-Tank Company (formed 12 May 1940, disbanded 7 January 1941) * 5th Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers (from 12 February 1945) * 7th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) (from 14 March 1945) Commanders The following officers commanded the 157th Infantry Brigade during the war: * Brigadier N.R.

Opportunity management is a collaborative approach for economic and business development. The process focuses on tangible outcomes. Opportunity management may result in interesting and motivating projects that help improve teamwork. Its three components are #generating ideas, #recognizing opportunities, and #driving opportunities. Risk Risk management can be described as the process of proactively working with stakeholders to minimise the risks and maximise the opportunity associated with project decisions. Risks are about the possibility of an adverse consequence. Good risk management does not have to be expensive or time consuming but relies on adaptability in response to change. Risk management ensures that an organization identifies and understands the risks to which it is exposed. Organisations continuously face environments in which uncertainty is constantly challenging the existing ways of doing business and the way that risk needs to be managed. However, the upside to risk, that is often overlooked, is that the feared uncertain event could have a desired outcome. TAP University's blog notes that this is a positive risk or opportunity and needs to be managed to ensure a good result. Having a clear understanding of all risks allows an organization to measure and prioritize them and take the appropriate actions to reduce losses. Where risk management seeks to understand what might go badly in a project, opportunity management looks for what might go better. Opportunity management is the process that converts the chance to decisiveness and is increasingly becoming embedded in the culture of organisations as they mature and broaden their understanding of the value that managing uncertainty can bring. For positive risk or opportunity management to be effective in creating or protecting value it must be an integral part of the management processes, be embedded in the culture and practices of the organisation, be tailored to the business process of the organisation, and comply with the risk management principles outlined in ISO 31000. An opportunity management process has required elements that need to be evaluated before advancing and allocating scarce resources to any project. All organisations have limited resources and it is important that they are used sensibly. The first step that an organisation should take in order to improve decision making and reduce risk is identifying potential opportunities. It is advised that a business takes the necessary time and considers numerous ways of identifying opportunities for initiatives. Organisations could implement processes like \\"organizational catch ball\\" which would help them to develop plans and strategies for economic growth in the community. As Conti notes, \\"the interactive catch ball process from management level to the next is necessary for correct planning and alignment of goals\\". They could also implement brainstorming activities, hold stakeholder meetings, hold focus group interviews and hold jurisdictional reviews. This would help the organisation generate ideas to include in the initiative funnel. The firm should proceed to evaluate and prioritize initiatives to enable more effective courses of action to be taken in the future. This would involve ranking criteria in order of importance to ensure the correct alignment of targets for the projects. It is vital that the firm includes many opportunities in the decision making funnel to be effective. This will allow for a more comprehensive scope of ideas to be included in the decision making funnel. Funnel Sample stage-gate decision making system. The number of stages and gates will vary depending on the initiative An opportunity management funnel is a framework that allows management to evaluate and select opportunities. An opportunity management funnel is a process whereby many opportunities are put in up front and fewer investment decisions coming out at the end of the funnel. The goal of the opportunity management funnel is to eliminate weak ideas before they consume excessive resources while allowing strong ideas to filter through the process. The challenges for the business and project management team is to make choices and decisions that move toward the desired objectives ‚Äì a task that is made difficult by change. The funnel approach raises questions pertaining to: * Who will work to move the idea forward? * What assessment criteria should be set? * Who will decide whether the idea should be pursued or dropped? * How will the decision be made? The funnel filters the broadest range of opportunities and ensures that all priority sectors are represented. The process must be unbiased and lead to a choice of resources that maximizes return. When selecting which opportunities to filter through the process, users should be aware that initially, there are no bad ideas or limits. The unviable alternatives will be filtered out using the phase‚Äìgate model. Rigorous screening must be applied to focus on the initiative. The business can examine the merit of each initiative before deciding to dedicate resources to the project. The business will have the option to implement three decisions at a gate such as advance, rework and kill the project. Perhaps the greatest challenge that users of stage and gate processes face is making the gates work well: as go the gate, so goes the process. This will help prevent the firm from wasting valuable resources and time on ineffective initiatives. Stage-gate/phase‚Äìgate decision making The stage-gate process was created because the traditional organisational structure is primarily for top-down, centralized control and communications, all of which are not practical for organizations that use project management and horizontal workflow. The stage-gate process evolved into life-cycle phases. Stages are phases of the decision-making process where development work is completed. Phase‚Äìgate systems divide the innovation process into a predetermined set of stages composed of a group of \\"prescribed, related, and often parallel activities.\\" Most Phase‚Äìgate systems involve four to seven stages. Since each proceeding stage is more expensive than the previous, it is imperative that a high degree of research-backed discrimination is involved in passing stages. The body of research collected for proposed initiatives should be frequently consulted to adequately support the decision-making processes. A firm could use certain assessment criteria to help identify opportunities and will ensure resources are not wasted on low value opportunities. There are three types of criteria that a firm could use. These include criteria of inclusion, criteria of exclusion and portfolio level criteria. Using assessment criteria would provide a transparent process that will highlight what initiatives to abandon and which initiatives to pursue. Exclusion criteria could be used by the firm, as it saves time and money. It is a simple method of reducing the number of initiatives to evaluate. \\"A firm must maintain records to support why a portfolio was assigned to a specific composite, or was excluded from all composites.\\" The firm could also look at inclusive criteria to help to prioritize initiatives. This could include ensuring that it has key stakeholder support, or making the initiative economically feasible. Portfolio level criteria may also be used to ensure the right mixes of initiatives are used. Ensuring that the initiatives stimulate job creation and have the support of the community are some of the criteria that the firm could include while planning an initiative. It is imperative that evaluation of each gate should be objective, open-minded, clear on the businesses' strategic goals and done by experienced people. People that are evaluating the project at each gate must have the courage to terminate the project if necessary. This is important as it will prevent any bias from occurring throughout the decision making phase. However, the system that the firm puts in place should not be so rigorous that it omits viable projects or too laid-back that resources are spread finely across multiple projects. \\"The lack of tough Go/Kill decision points means too many product failures, resources wasted on the wrong projects, and a lack of focus.\\" A level of uncertainty can be positive for evaluating criteria by the firm as too many kills of ideas may discourage stakeholders from forming ideas.  Philosophical underpinnings  A risk and opportunity management policy is a statement of intent which should communicate an organisations attitude, rational and philosophy towards risk and opportunity management. While opportunity management is considered to be a recent phenomenon resulting from the blending different project management methodologies, business development is well-rooted in philosophy. Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics clearly differentiates between the outcomes (ends) we aim to achieve and the outputs (means) we use to achieve these outcomes. Careful deliberation is required to select the outputs that are most likely to contribute to the outcomes we desire. Aristotle understands that problems could arise that would necessitate dropping one output in favor of another. Aristotle's theory links the logic- model to the Phase‚Äìgate process thereby introducing deliberation and kill points. Aristotle states: \\"Rather, we lay down the end, and then examine the ways to and means to achieve it. If it appears that any of several [possible] means will reach it, we examine which of them will reach it most easily and most finely; and if only one [possible] means reaches it, we examine how that means will reach it and how the means itself is reached, until we come to the first cause, the last thing to be discovered. For a deliberator would seem to inquire and analyze in the way described, as though analyzing a diagram...If we encounter an impossible step ‚Äì for instance, we need money but cannot raise it ‚Äì we desist; but if it appears possible we undertake it. What is possible is what we achieve through our agency [including what our friend could achieve for us]... Deliberation is about the actions he can do, and actions are for the sake of other things; hence we deliberate about things that promote an end, not about the end.\\"Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, trans. Terrence Irwin, 2nd ed. (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company Inc., 1999) 35-36 Kant's Critique of Judgment is probably the most important and influential work in Western aesthetic theory. Philosopher Immanuel Kant's aesthetic theory also offers insight into opportunity management as it makes the connection between the imaginative (open end of the funnel) and understanding (application of deliberative thought and criteria). Kant states: \\"For, in lawless freedom, imagination, with all its wealth, produces nothing but nonsense; the power of judgement, on the other hand, is the faculty that makes it consonant with understanding. Taste, like judgement in general, is the discipline (or corrective) of genius. ... It introduces a clearness and order into the plenitude of thought, and in so doing, gives stability to the ideas, and qualifies them at once for permanent and universal approval.\\"Immanuel Kant, The Critique of Judgement Part One, trans. James Creed Meredith (Stilwell: Digireads.com Publishing, 2005) 100. There are endless things that can be considered, but only a small portion of these can practically be achieved. If opportunity management does not adequately address both imagination and understanding, the best opportunities will not be pursued. Some individuals and organisations have become so used to thinking of risk management solely in terms of the negative outcomes of uncertainty that they recoil from using the same process to address opportunities. Opportunity management requires originality and rule: Kant notes: \\"...genius (1) is a talent for producing that for which no definite rule can be given, and not an aptitude in a way of cleverness for what can be learned according to some rule; and that consequently originality must be its primary property. (2) Since there may be original nonsense, its products must at the same time be models, i.e., be exemplary; and consequently, though not themselves derived from imitation, they must serve that purpose for others, i.e., as a standard or rule of estimating. (3) It cannot indicate scientifically how it brings about its product, but rather gives the rule as nature. Hence, where an author owes a product to his genius, he does not himself know how the ideas for it have entered into his head, nor has he the power to invent like at pleasure, or methodologically, and communicate the same to others in such precepts as would put them in a position to produce similar products... (4) Nature prescribes the rule through genius not to science but to art, and this also only in so far as it is to be fine art.\\"Immanuel Kant, The Critique of Judgement Part One, trans. James Creed Meredith (Stilwell: Digireads.com Publishing, 2005) 92-93. American philosopher Charles S. Pierce notes that new knowledge originates outside of the traditional logic of induction and deduction. He posits a process of abduction through which a mind freed from constraints to arrive at a creative inference. Abduction is a process of conjecture that is capable of creating new knowledge through the positing of a novel hypothesis. It makes no claim to ‚Äòwhat is' but rather to ‚Äòwhat might be.' The content of the idea cannot be tested in advance but where the process of reaching a decision is biased the idea is likely to be flawed. Peirce notes, \\"But observed facts relate exclusively to the particular circumstances that happen to exist when they were observed. They do not relate to any future occasions upon which we may be in doubt how we ought to act. They, therefore, do not, in themselves contain practical knowledge.\\"Charles S. Pierce, \\"Abduction and Induction,\\" Philosophical Writings of Peirce, ed. Justus Buchler (New York: Dover Publications Inc., 1955) 150. Opportunity management entails ongoing assessment of the decision-making process increasing the likelihood of success. Roger Martin asserts that Pierce's notion of abduction is the basis of what he terms \\"Design Thinking\\" which is at the core of \\"the most powerful formula for competitive advantage in the twenty-first century.\\"Roger Martin, The Design of Business: Why Design Thinking is the Next Competitive Advantage, (Boston: Harvard Business Press, 2009) 26. Design thinking is about the creation of, as well as the adaptive use of a body-of behaviors and values. Design thinking embeds integrative thinking throughout the entire organization. In his book \\"The Opposable Mind\\", Martin states: \\"At its core, integrative thinking requires the integration of mastery and originality. Without mastery there won't be a useful salience, causality, or architecture. Without originality, there will be no creative resolution. Without creative resolution, there will be no enhancement of mastery, and when mastery stagnates, so does originality. Mastery is an enabling condition for originality, which in turn, is a generative condition for mastery. The modes are interdependent.\\"Roger Martin, The Opposable Mind: How Successful Leaders Win Through Integrative Thinking, (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 2007) 187. Project management Project management is the planning, organizing and controlling of a firm's resources to achieve reasonably short- term goals that have been established to complete specific targets and objectives. It is usually management driven and focuses on setting targets, problem solving and obtaining results. The purpose of project management is to act as a change agent, delivering a change to the status quo of a project, and achieving this in a controlled and managed way. In the initiation stage of project management, opportunity management may aid in the determination of the nature and scope of the project. Much like the initiation stage of project management, opportunity management aids in determining the nature and scope of projects. Since the initiation stage is crucial to the overall performance of the project management cycle, opportunity management may be used by project managers to determine which projects are worth pursuing. Project management is an attempt to manage uncertainty, since it is seen as a structured approach to produce managed change in a changing environment. Most notably, opportunity management may aid in defining the business needs/requirements of the organization through the filtration of various alternatives and budgeting requirements. In the process of planning, projects should be properly defined and divided into logical, progressive steps. The screening and assessment criteria offered by opportunity management allow project managers to establish the business case for the project. Opportunity management determines which projects are worth pursuing before dedicating excessive resources. As the project progresses from the initiation stage to the planning and design phase, the screening and assessment criteria will act as a continuous gauge to determine the viability of the project. This ongoing determination of the viability of the project also aids in portfolio management since project managers employ opportunity management to determine which projects are worth pursuing and the prioritization of projects. Furthermore, project managers should be able to identify and engage the appropriate stakeholders throughout the entire project life cycle and determine who must be involved in each phase and who merely needs to be kept informed of the progress made. Opportunity management determines the payback of the project within the initiation stage. Although the payback period is defined by Kerzner as the least precise of all capital budgeting methods because the calculations are in dollars and cannot adjusted for the time value of money. By establishing the payback period within the opportunity management process, project managers may continually assess the project expenditures and re-evaluate the payback period on an ongoing basis. Project management is the planning, delegating, monitoring and controlling of all aspects of the project, and the motivation of those involved, to achieve the project objectives within the expected performance targets for time, cost, quality, scope benefits and risks. The monitoring and control phase of project management mirrors fairly closely stage gate decision making, although stage gate decision making addresses potential problems earlier in the project management cycle. Like the monitoring and control phase, the logic model employed in opportunity management observes and monitors the project performance on an ongoing basis. The logic model helps a firm to outline the sequence of events related to the project. In a nutshell, a logic model is a valuable tool that produces a basic program \\"picture\\" that shows how the organisation's program is intended to do work. If the project is determined to be unable to meet the criteria outlined in the opportunity management process, the project or opportunity managers will take measures to correct the problems and put the project back on track. Community capacity building Capacity building is designed to promote change. Capacity building may be defined as anything that increases the ability and/or desire of groups, businesses, municipalities, not-for-profit organizations to effectively engage in community economic development. Stakeholders such as Governments can contribute to environmental community capacity building not only through the provision of practical support in terms of resource provision and throughout the opening up of information and communication channels for communities, but also ensuring that there is meaningful collaboration with communities. Capacity building is an approach to economic development that focuses on understanding the difficulties that prevent people, governments, organizations form recognizing their developmental goals while enhancing the abilities that will allow them to achieve measurable and sustainable results. It involves training and development activities that get the community actively involved in the development of their locality. Put simply, capacity building is any initiative that increases the desire or ability of individuals, groups and organisations to effectively participate in economic development activities. Community capacity building assists groups by enhancing skills essential to regional economic planning, development and implementation. Capacity building cannot be seen or undertaken in isolation as it is deeply embedded in the social, economic and political environment. It is about strengthening peoples capacity to determine their own values and priorities and to act on these, which gives us the basis of development. In examining community capacity building and local economic development, it is essential to recognise the importance of building links between social economy organisations and the private sector as well as governments in order to address the complex social and economic problems which all communities confront. Along with \\"empowerment, \\"participation\\", and \\"gender equality\\", capacity building is seen as an essential element if development is to be sustainable and centered in people. Developing opportunity management systems is an important part of opportunity management since the model since it allows organizations to identify the most effective allocation of resources. Since communities have fixed resources, opportunity management is a useful tool to identify the most utilitarian allocation of resources to achieve the maximum benefit. The essential criteria for all initiatives should be included and must not be wasted as all organisations face limited resources. Community capacity building has the potential to reach into social and economic life and contribute to building stronger, more cohesive and resilient communities.

In a career that lasted from August 1840 to September 1841 he ran seven races. He began his career with a run of six successive victories including the 1841 Epsom Derby. He was retired after being narrowly defeated in the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster. Coronation later had moderate success as a stallion before he was exported to Russia. Background Coronation, a \\"blood\\" bay horse standing 16 hands high, was bred by his owner, Abraham Rawlinson of Chadlington in Oxfordshire. The Farmer's Magazine described him as a \\"splendid looking animal\\" with a strong, tapering head, muscular shoulders and long legs. Coronation was prepared for racing \\"with considerable ability\\" by Ben Painter (or Painten), Rawlinson's \\"stud groom\\" at Chadlington and Heythrop Park. He was foaled in the year of Queen Victoria's coronation. Coronation's sire, Sir Hercules, was an Irish-bred racehorse who ran third in the St Leger of 1829. He went on to become a highly successful and influential stallion. He sired many important winners including Faugh-a-Ballagh (St Leger), The Corsair (2000 Guineas) and Birdcatcher, the male-line ancestor of most modern thoroughbreds. Racing career 1840: two-year-old season Coronation ran twice as a two-year-old in the summer of 1840. On his first appearance on 18 August he easily won a four-runner Sweepstakes for two- and three-year-old at Oxford Racecourse from a filly named Pelerine. He followed up by beating two opponents in a Sweepstakes at Warwick, winning by a neck from St Cloud, at odds of 1/4. After the race he was described as \\"the finest two-year-old\\" of the season and bookmakers offered him at odds of 18/1 for the following year's Derby. 1841: three-year-old season On his three-year-old debut, Coronation won the Trial Stakes Warwick in impressive style in a large, but undistinguished field. On 15 April, Coronation's odds for the Derby were cut from 10/1to 9/1. In the final build-up to the Derby, Rawlinson entrusted the horse to a professional trainer, Isaac Day, who was based at Northleach, Gloucestershire. At Epsom on 26 May, Coronation started 5/2 favourite for the Derby, having been backed down from 4/1 in the hours before the race, in a record field of twenty-nine runners. He was ridden by Patrick Conolly (or Connolly), a jockey who had won the 1834 Derby on Plenipotentiary. The weather was warm and sunny and the customary huge crowd ‚Äì described by the Sunday Times as an \\"immense mob\\" combining every \\"rank, wealth, talent and beauty in the country\\" ‚Äì was in attendance. There was no Royal presence, but the nobility were represented by four Dukes, four Marquises and seven Earls. After a long delay caused by six or seven false starts the race got under way and Conolly positioned Coronation just behind the leaders. The favourite was always traveling easily, and when the leading horses began to tire in the straight, Conolly sent him to the front. Coronation quickly went clear and was never challenged, winning easily by three lengths from Van Amburgh. Following the race, the winner was surrounded by celebrating crowds and panicked, kicking out and killing one spectator. In addition to the prize money of ¬£4,275, Rawlinson took an estimated ¬£8,000 in winning bets. At Royal Ascot on 8 June, in front of a crowd including the Queen Victoria, Coronation walked over in the Ascot Derby (a race now known as the King Edward VII Stakes) when the other entrants were withdrawn. On 18 August, Coronation raced against older horses for the first time in the two and a quarter mile Oxford Cup. He won at odds of 1/5 beating Isaac, Executrix and Caravan. Coronation's performances during the summer had been so dominant that the St Leger on 14 September was considered a formality, and attracted less interest than usual. He started the 1/2 favourite against ten opponents, of whom only the Marquess of Westminster's colt Satirist (5/1) was given any chance against him. Coronation took the lead at half way and entered the straight traveling well and looking the likely winner. But Satirist, ridden by Bill Scott, produced a strong challenge, and the two colts raced side by side throughout the last furlong. In the closing strides Satirist gained a slight advantage, and Coronation was beaten by \\"half a neck\\". According to his jockey, John Day, Coronation had been \\"treated like a spoiled child\\" in the build-up to the St Leger and went to Doncaster some way below peak fitness. Stud career Coronation was not a great success as a stallion, but he did sire The Flea who won the 1000 Guineas in 1849. One of his daughters, British Queen, became a successful broodmare. After a few seasons at stud in England, Coronation was exported to Russia. Pedigree *Coronation was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Alexander, meaning that the stallion, a son of Eclipse, appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

It began as a men's adventure digest-sized magazine but became a pornographic magazine in the 1970s. It was published by a New York based company called Magazine Management (later known as Marvel Entertainment) which published similar magazines like Stag and Male. Writers Because it employed young writers in New York City, many of its former staff and contributors became well known later in their lives. All of them wrote under pseudonyms while writing or editing For Men Only. Novelist Martin Cruz Smith described writing for the magazine in the 1960s when a team of two editors - junior and senior - created the entire magazine each month. At the time the magazine featured a photospread and centerfold but the female model was not nude. Cruz worked at the magazine from the mid-1960s to 1968. Donald Bain wrote for the magazine in the early 1960s at a time when other writers contributing to the cluster of men's magazines included Mario Puzo, Mickey Spillane and Bruce Jay Friedman. Bain described writing for the magazine as a sought-after job for writers at the time because \\"the money was good and the writing was easy\\". He said that while the stories were usually billed as being true, it was common practice for writers to completely make them up, including quotes from fictitious experts. Likewise, many of the stories billed as excerpts from upcoming novels were actually just double-length articles written specifically for the magazine.

Instead of using methods like cash, cheque, and credit card, a customer can use a mobile phone to transfer money or to pay for goods and services. A customer can transfer money or pay for goods and services by sending an SMS, using a Java application over GPRS, a WAP service, over IVR or other mobile communication technologies. In India, this service is bank- led.http://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/bs_viewcontent.aspx?Id=1750 Customers wishing to avail themselves of this service will have to register with banks which provide this service. Currently, this service is being offered by several major banks and is expected to grow further. Mobile Payment Forum of India (MPFI) is the umbrella organisation which is responsible for deploying mobile payments in India. India is the world's largest-growing mobile payments market.  Background  India has a vast non-banking population, most of whom reside in the rural areas. The traditional banking industry can not cater to the needs of India's large rural populace.http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_data_finder/A_Series/Number_of_Village.htm Setting up a conventional bank branch in a rural area would require considerable amounts of money to be spent on infrastructure and additional personnel. Most of rural Indians are cut off from access to basic financial services, which include deposits and withdrawals from a trusted source. Growth of mobile phones in India Annual growth of mobile subscriber base in India However, India is the second-largest telecommunications market and has 1100.37 million mobile phone customers. Mobile phones are quite common even in the remote villages. The mobile phone industry is growing at a rate of over 200 million per year. It was expected to touch the one and a half billion mark by 2015. The share of the urban subscribers is 66% and the share of the rural subscribers was 34%. In May 2011, the net monthly addition in terms of the number of subscriptions was 13.35 million. Of those, 7.33 million were from the urban segment and 6.02 million from the rural segment. The subscription growth rate on a monthly basis is 55% for urban segments and 45% for rural segments. Given this context, it is possible to consider the mobile phone as an economically viable instrument to enable inclusive access to financial services. Impact of mobile phones on welfare Mobile telephony has had an impact mainly by allowing for agents in information restricted areas to engage in more optimal arbitrage. The adoption of mobile phones by fishermen and wholesalers resulted in a dramatic reduction in price dispersion, the complete elimination of waste, and a near-perfect adherence to the law of one price. Both consumer and producer welfare increased. Mobile payments can have a positive impact on welfare by easing operational aspects and associated costs of cash-based transactions related to cash handling, storage and transfer, and by providing a strong platform for financial inclusion. Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) On November 22, 2010, NPCI launched Immediate Payment Services (IMPS) to offer an instant, 24-hour√ó7, interbank electronic fund transfer service through mobile phones. IMPS facilitate customers to use mobile instruments as a channel for accessing their bank accounts and put high interbank fund transfers in a secured manner with immediate confirmation features. With over 900 million mobile subscriber and robust payment infrastructure, IMPS is well positioned to fulfill its objectives of enabling bank customers to use mobile instruments as a preferred channel for accessing their banks accounts, remit funds and also sub-serve the goal of electronification of retail payments. More than 54 banks already offer IMPS services to their customers. The basic aim of IMPS is to also enable micropayments on low-end mobile devices which support only voice and text, in addition to higher-end phones which could support web browsing or Java application capabilities. A person who has subscribed to a mobile payment service should be able to send money to any other person who has subscribed as well. This should be independent of the mobile network and the bank to which either of the persons belong. This is referred to as interoperability and is a key concern for any major technology to be successful.Chandrahas, Praveen, Deepti Kumar, Ramya Karthik, Timothy Gonsalves, Ashok Jhunjhunwala, and Gaurav Raina. \\"Some design considerations for a mobile payment architecture.\\" In Communications (NCC), 2011 National Conference on, pp. 1-5. IEEE, 2011. In India, the model for the delivery of IMPS will be bank- linked;http://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/bs_viewcontent.aspx?Id=1750 which implies that customers wishing to avail themselves of this service should have: * Initially, a registered mobile phone account with any network operator in the country, and * A bank account * Register for the mobile payment service with the bank In contrast, in economies such as Kenya, the mobile network operators lead the development of mobile financial services. Choosing a bank-linked model enables offerings of a variety of value added financial service built on top of the basic mobile payment transaction. The idea of mobile financial solutions will only then permeate to all levels of society: customers, merchants, business houses and the government. The technical standards are set up by MPFI, and are implemented by the various participating entities after being ratified by the RBI.  Key features  The key features of IMPS Funds Transfer are as follows: * Instant funds transfer * 24-hour, 365-day availability * Credit and debit confirmations to sender and receiver * Simple and easy to use * Fast, inexpensive, safe and secure, accessible Currently IMPS service is provided to the customers over various channels including SMS, Bank Mobile Application and USSD (*99#).  Transaction flow  The transaction flow for IMPS can be simply described as 'customer-bank-bank- customer'. When a customer initiates a transaction by sending an SMS to the bank's gateway, this SMS is processed by a mobile payment provider (MPP). The role of MPP is defined in the standards document. After appropriate checks with the customer's bank, the transaction is forwarded to a central switch. The role of the switching agency is played by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). NPCI routes transaction to the payee's bank based on the MMID. A transaction is initiated by sending the following details: * Mobile number of the payee * The seven-digit MMID of the payee * The amount of money to be transferred * The four-digit personal identification number (PIN) of the payer Depending on the type of the transaction, either both parties (payer and payee) or only a single party is notified about the transaction. A successful transaction will be notified by an SMS to both parties. The communication between the MPPs and the banks takes place using ISO 8583 message format,Kumar, D.; Gonsalves, T.A.; Jhunjhunwala, A.; Raina, G.; Communications (NCC), 2010 National Conference onDigital Object Identifier:10.1109/NCC.2010.5430160 Publication Year:2010, Page(s):1-5 which is the standard message format for all financial messages in India. In order to test the compliance and conformance to the standards set and the message formats, a certification lab is being set up at IIT Madras.  MMID  The Mobile Money IDentifier (MMID) is the key identifying detail of a user participating in a transaction. An MMID is a seven-digit number given to a customer upon registration with a bank for the service. In the seven digits of the MMID are four digits used to identify the bank of the user and three digits used to identify the account of the user. A mobile number and a MMID will uniquely identify a customer‚Äôs account with the respective bank. The design of the MMID allows customers to operate multiple bank accounts linked to a single mobile number; each bank account has its own MMID. Additionally, since the MMID of the payee must be entered along with the payee's mobile phone number, it serves to reduce the possibility of an erroneous transaction when the payer inadvertently enters an incorrect mobile number. The MMID is not intended to be a secret ‚Äì it is simply an identifier and it does not give away any sensitive information about the customer. For example, a merchant will advertise his mobile number and MMID publicly in order to receive payments from the customers.  Communication channels  The mobile payments service is available over a wide range of communication channels. The following communication channels are often used in combination to provide a complete end-to-end service: * SMS * WAP * USSD * IVR * Phone-based application: J2ME/BREW * ATM * Internet A user will use a particular set of communication channels depending on the capabilities of the mobile phone. The implementation of the standards will vary depending on the set used.  Application based  Most banks provide a Java application that can be downloaded on a Java-enabled phone which will guide the user through the money transfer process. An SMS sent through a Java application on the mobile device is as secure as an Internet banking transaction, since it can be encrypted between the user and the bank.  SMS and IVR  An SMS‚ÄìIVR combination is used for transactions for mobile phones without Java capabilities. An SMS is sent to a phone number provided by the bank, and an IVR call-back is used for authentication and the transaction is carried forward as a voice-based transaction, at the end of which the user will be prompted to enter the MPIN. The SMS channel is used to send notification messages, while the IVR channel which is as secure as a GSM channel.  USSD  A transaction can also be initiated over USSD. A USSD session will provide the user with simple prompts over a menu allowing the user to input the payee's mobile number and MMID, and the user's own MMID and PIN for authentication.  Security  Every communication channel has its own set of security mechanisms. In addition, the RBI-issued guidelines on security of mobile paymentshttp://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/bs_viewcontent.aspx?Id=1750 require a two-factor authentication mechanism to be employed. A two-factor authentication in this context consists of: * What you know: User PIN, MMID * What you have: Mobile number, mobile phone, SIM card No transaction can take place without the use of the secret PIN. The guidelines also specify a cap on the amount of money that can be sent during transactions.  Use cases  Mobile payments enable a variety of possible uses, considering that the underlying architecture is interoperable and supports payments to other peers, merchants and government offices.  Pre-paid mobile top-up  Mobile top-up for prepaid mobile subscribers is one of the most common mobile-related financial transactions. This is made considerably easier, if the payment for topping up the mobile account can also be made over the mobile phone. There are already many online recharge options available and emerging, which point to the rapid growth in this business segment.http://theagni.com/2011/07/28/state-of-online-recharge-mobile- services-in-india/  Domestic peer-to-peer remittances  Mobile payments can also be used to remit money. Migrant workers (from other states) in India need to transfer money to their kin in their native states. Using this service, transfer of money is safe, fast and effective as established by a pilot study conducted. This has potential to act as a very significant driver for adoption of mobile payment services in this demographic.  Bill and merchant payments  Bill payments provide convenience for the user and for utility companies. For payment to merchants, they offer another medium for the customer which vastly reduces cash management.  Governance  Mobile payments can have a large impact on interaction with government services and are being explored in India.http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/industry-and- economy/government-and-policy/article2397199.ece Mobile payments are convenient to track and account for, key requirements in government payment transactions. Government to peer payments can also be made easier by using mobile payment channelscga.nic.in/pdf/DougJohnson.pdf and is being explored for schemes like NREGA.nrega.nic.in/circular/minutes%20ICT%20meeting%2017-11-2009.pdf  New business opportunities  Mobile payments could also open the possibility for new business models, as now one would have the ability to pay and receive even small sums of money, almost instantaneously. A variety of value-added services based on mobile payment transactions are already entering the market.https://home.kpmg/cn/en/home/insights/2011/07/2011-mobile-payments- outlook-o-201107.html  Adoption of mobile payments  There are various drivers that push the need and desire of mobile payments services in India, and there are several challenges which need to be addressed in order to ensure adoption of the technology in the Indian context. One of the key roles of The Mobile Payment Forum of India is to address these challenges that may inhibit the widespread use of mobile financial services. As per report from RedSeer Consulting, Indian market consist of 160 million unique mobile payment users till 2020 which will increase to 800 million by the year 2025 with transaction volume of Rs.7,092 trillion at a rate of 3.5 percent. Lower income groups will make smaller transactions with mobile wallets by 2025.  Drivers for mobile financial services  * High penetration of mobile subscribers. * Mobile top- up services, domestic remittances and bill payments can be made very conveniently over a mobile phone. * Growing demand, and an existing thriving ecosystem, for mobile services like ring tone downloads, Bollywood music, update for cricket matches, etcetera. Thus the uptake for another service, especially financial services, should be positive. * Drive to be a part of the financial system for those people who currently do not have a bank account. The cost of cash handling, storage and transfer is very high in the informal sector. The ability to perform basic financial transactions over a mobile could act as a driver. * There is a strong demographic dividend in India, where a large proportion of the population is very young. The young are often enthusiastic to take up new technologies and services.  Challenges for mobile financial services in India  * Poor levels of literacy are a problem, and voice-based services offer a potential solution. Voice-based solutions, especially in local languages, have two major benefits: they can work on all handsets and can be used by all irrespective of one‚Äôs comfort level with technology or level of literacy. * The mobile financial services have to be effective in terms of usability, cost, efficiency, interoperability and security for transactions of all ticket sizes. * M-payments options should be available even on low end mobile handsets.  Financial inclusion  The un-banked population can be classified into broad categories: those who do not open accounts due to lack of banking infrastructure, those who for various reasons (such as poverty and lack of valid identity papers) do not pass the required account opening criteria, and those who currently see no requirement to open an account.http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/bs_speechesview.aspx?id=342 This process can be broken into three aspects: opening a bank account, managing the account, and having access to a set of financial services and products. To open an account, one has to satisfy the bank‚Äôs KYC (Know Your Customer) norms. For the un-banked, providing a valid identity is a challenge. To that end, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has embarked on a mission to offer a single source of identity verification which can also be used to open bank accounts. Managing the account is something that mobile money solutions will make much easier, faster and cheaper, both for the customers and the banks. The key challenge is to determine if it is possible to devise demand driven financial products and services which make for a compelling reason to open an account. For example, a common need is a low value, low cost loan, for which the un-banked can typically offer no collateral. If this need can be addressed, via an appropriate business model, then managing that loan in terms of repayments is much easier over a mobile device. In this context, mobile payment solutions can certainly help by providing an effective channel for money transfer for both categories of the un-banked. The issue of depositing money into a bank account where banks do not have a presence is addressed by the concept of banking correspondents.  Banking correspondent  Though mobile payments allow payments to be made electronically, they do not enable depositing money into a bank. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tended to this issue by creating the post of a banking correspondent (BC).http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Mode=0&Id;=2718 The role of a BC is to act as an interface between the bank and its customers in places where traditional banking is not feasible. Banks can appoint a trusted third party as a BC in a village. All the villagers who wish to transact with the bank can get in touch with the BC. Deposit and withdrawal of money is handled by the BC. When a person deposits money at the BC, their account immediately gets credited. The person can then use their mobile phone for additional transactions.  Differences with mobile banking  The major difference between mobile banking and mobile payments is the total absenteeism of the bank account number. In mobile banking or Internet banking, money can be transferred only when the account number of the payee is known before-hand. The account of the payee has to be registered with the payer and only then can a fund transfer happen. In mobile payments, the account number is masked from being public. One need not know the account number of a person to transfer money.Kumar, D.; Gonsalves, T.A.; Jhunjhunwala, A.; Raina, G.; Communications (NCC), 2010 National Conference on Digital Object Identifier: 10.1109/NCC.2010.5430160; Publication Year: 2010; Pages: 1‚Äì5 This opens up a range of possibilities from buying tickets to paying auto fare, both of which would not have been feasible had the account number been mandatory for a simple transaction.

As a result of army-wide reorganization in the 1950s, the 121st Infantry ceased to exist as a single unit; today, various units of the Georgia National Guard trace their lineage to the 121st Infantry. History The 121st Infantry Regiment was formed from the 2nd Georgia Infantry Regiment in 1916 and assigned to the 31st Division. During World War One, the 121st was assigned to the 61st Infantry Brigade of the 31st Division.Brief Histories of Divisions, U.S. Army, p. 39, Historical Branch, War Plans Division, June 1921 The units of the 31st Division, including the 121st Infantry, were broken up upon arrival at Brest and used to provide replacements for other units at the front lines in France. The regiment was demobilized on 14 January 1919 at Fort Gordon, Georgia.Steven E. Clay, U.S. Army Order of Battle 1919-1941, p. 415, Fort Leavenworth: Combat Studies Institute Press, 2010 After unit changes that saw the unit retitled 1st Infantry, Georgia National Guard and 122nd Infantry Regiment, the 121st Infantry Regiment was formed again as a Georgia National Guard unit in Macon, Georgia, and federally recognized on 9 June 1924. At this time, the regiment was also assigned to the 30th Division. The regiment was activated in 1925 because of hurricane damage at Tybee Island, and was activated again in 1934 to confront striking textile workers in the Georgia towns of Griffin, Jackson, and Rome. On 22 November 1941, the regiment was relieved of assignment to the 30th Division and assigned to the 8th Division (later retitled \\"8th Infantry Division\\"). The regiment was briefly organized as a motorized infantry regiment before reverting to traditional infantry organization prior to shipping overseas. The 121st Infantry subsequently saw combat with the 8th Infantry Division in the European Theater of Operations during 1944-45. Jeep of the Headquarters of the 8th {Infantry Division} 121st Infantry Regiment at the Hurtgen Forrest Battle. The regiment returned from World War II at the Boston port of entry on 11 July 1945 and then moved to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, where it was inactivated on 20 October 1945.Shelby L. Stanton, World War II Order of Battle, p. 291, New York: Galahad Books, 1991 In September 1946, the 121st Infantry Regiment was assigned to the 48th Infantry Division, a national guard division headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida. In 1955, this division became the 48th Armored Division and moved its headquarters to Macon, Georgia. As a result of this reorganization, the 121st Infantry Regiment ceased to exist as a tactical organization. Some elements of the 121st Infantry were transferred to the 162nd Tank Battalion in May 1956. As the army adopted the Pentomic structure in the late 1950s, infantry regiments were broken up and the component battalions reassigned to brigade headquarters while still retaining the number of their former regiment in their titles. Thus, while the 121st Infantry has not existed as a separate tactical organization since the mid-1950s, some Georgia National Guard battalions, such as 2nd Battalion, 121st Infantry Regiment are still affiliated with the regiment, but assigned to brigades such as the 48th Infantry Brigade for purposes of tactical organization. Battalions of the former 121st Infantry were assigned to the 48th Armored Division from 1959 until 1968, the 30th Infantry Division from 1968 through 1973, and 48th Infantry Brigade from 30 November 1973 to present.Timothy Aumiller, United States Army Infantry, Armor/Cavalry, Artillery Battalions 1957-2011, p. 26, Orbat.com for Tiger Lily Publications, 2011 Distinctive unit insignia The regimental nickname \\"The Gray Bonnets\\" is derived from the title of a song, \\"Put on Your Old Gray Bonnets\\" adopted in 1928 as the official air, or marching song, of the regiment. The distinctive unit insignia of the regiment is an \\"Old Gray Bonnet\\" proper, and is one of the few DUIs in the U.S. Army designed to be manufactured and worn in pairs (left and right). The insignia is a blue shield with a gray saltire cross and a prickly pear and fleur-de-lis, and a boar's Head with an oak branch in its mouth on top. The blue background represents the Infantry while the gray cross symbolizes the unit's Confederate service. The cactus represents duty on the Mexican border, and the fleur-de-lis service in France during World War I. The boar's head with oak branch is the crest of the Georgia Army National Guard. The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the 121st Regiment Infantry, Georgia National Guard on 27 June 1928. It was amended to permit manufacturing in pairs on 16 August 1928. It was redesignated for the 162d Tank Battalion, Georgia National Guard on 24 May 1956. The insignia was redesignated for the 121st Infantry, Georgia National Guard on 17 April 1961. 2nd Battalion, 121st Infantry Regiment The 2nd Battalion, 121st Infantry Regiment is a light infantry battalion of the 48th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT), Georgia Army National Guard. The Battalion is one of the oldest units in the U.S. Army, tracing its lineage to Georgia state militia units formed between 1810 and 1825. The Battalion provides the 48th Brigade with mounted and dismounted maneuver assets to destroy enemy formations in close combat. Prior to 2007, the unit was designated as a heavy mechanized formation and equipped with M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles. Pre-World War I The earliest units associated with the 2nd Battalion, 121st Infantry were the Albany Guards and Barnesville Blues of the Georgia State Militia. These units, formed in 1810 along with the Baldwin Blues and Floyd Rifles, were the first organized infantry militia units in the state. In 1825, the Macon Volunteers also organized. Detachments of these infantry units served in the Seminole War and the Mexican War. During the American Civil War, the regiment was organized as the 4th Regiment Georgia Volunteers, 3rd Georgia Battalion, and finally the 37th Georgia Regiment. Units fought in most major battles of the war, including Malvern Hill, Sharpsburg, Spottsylvania, the Battle of Gettysburg, Second Manassas, Richmond, Seven Pines, Mechanicsville, Cold Harbor, the Wilderness Campaign, and Appomattox. During the post-Reconstruction period several other regional units were added to the rolls, and by 1891 the regiment had organized into two battalions under the banner of the Second Georgia Infantry Regiment. In 1898, the Barnesville Blues fought as Company F, 2nd Battalion, 2nd Georgia Infantry Regiment during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. During the Militia Act reorganization of the army in 1916, the 2nd Georgia became the 121st Infantry Regiment of the 31st \\"Dixie\\" Division. World War I and Inter-war Years With war looming in Europe, 2nd Battalion, 121st Infantry was federalized to patrol the border with Mexico. In 1916 and 1917, elements rotated between the southern border, Georgia and Florida. The prickly pear on the left of the Distinctive Unit Insignia alludes to this mission. In September 1918, the entire regiment was ordered to duty in World War I. They arrived in France in October, and before the regiment disembarked, tragedy struck. Longtime commander COL J. A. Thomas, the man responsible for the regimental title \\"The Old Gray Bonnets\\", died aboard ship. The news didn't get any better for the tight knit unit once ashore as most of the unit was broken up into small replacement groups and immediately sent to the front. However, F Company of 2nd Battalion, along with B and C Companies of the 1st Battalion had travelled to Europe separately and were assigned intact to the 151st Machine Gun Battalion of the 42nd (Rainbow) Division. Elements of the regiment were to participate in six separate campaigns during their brief service in the war, garnering several individual citations of valor. This service is represented by the fleur-de-leis in the left side of the unit's DUI. Upon return from France, the units were reorganized several times. In 1925, while at summer encampment at Tybee Island, GA, a hurricane struck. The National Guard camp was completely flooded and had to be rebuilt by men of the battalion. In 1934, labor unrest struck the textile mills of Georgia and 2nd Battalion was again called up, this time for state duty. Once state troops became involved in the labor troubles, they quickly died down with little violence. In 1938, with war threatening Europe again, the massive Mississippi Maneuvers were conducted by the U.S. Army at Camp Shelby, MS. 2nd Battalion was one of the units involved. In 1940, as war seemed more inevitable, the Army developed an even larger exercise, the Louisiana maneuvers. Upon completion of that assignment, the entire regiment was federalized on 16 September 1940 at Ft. Jackson, SC and assigned to the 30th Division. World War II The 2‚Äì121 Infantry saw extensive activity leading up to World War II and extensive action during WWII. The regiment was assigned to the 8th Infantry Division and saw action in four campaigns in Northwestern Europe (1944‚Äì45). Among the many battles that the regiment participated in during its ten months of combat duty were the Battle for Brest and the Battle of H√ºrtgen Forest. From 1990 The Battalion was federalized for Desert Storm as part of the 48th Infantry Brigade on 30 November 1990. It arrived at Fort Stewart on or around 3 December 1990. After certifying at the National Training Center as combat- ready, the whole brigade was demobilised between 27 March and 10 April 1991.Thomas D. Dinackus, 'Order of Battle: Allied Ground Forces of Desert Storm,' chart 10-3 footnote 10. The Battalion then deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina for Stabilization Force (SFOR) Rotation 9 to provide support operations for Task Force Eagle (United States contingent to United Nations Operations in support of Dayton Peace Accord). The SFOR9 rotation was scheduled from April to October 2001.  Global War on Terror  The Battalion mobilized as a component of the 48th Brigade Combat Team in 2004 for War on Terror combat operations. In May 2005 the unit began deploying to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom and experienced some of the fiercest combat actions in the campaign. During the first half of the brigade's deployment to Iraq (Spring 2005 through Spring 2006), the 2‚Äì121st spent much of its time of the region of Baghdad while the sister units 1‚Äì108 Armor was in the Southwest region (triangle of death). The unit's focus shifted during the second half of the deployment to a theater security mission primarily consisting of convoy escort and civilian military operations. 2‚Äì121 suffered eight fatalities while deployed to Iraq. On 20 April 2006, at Ft. Stewart, members of the 2‚Äì121st returned home after a year of combat operations in Iraq. As a part of the United States Army's ongoing transformation to a lighter, more modular force the 2nd Battalion, 121st Infantry was re-designated as light infantry in 2007. The unit gave up its M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles and became a dismounted force, with its anti-armor (Delta) company receiving up-armored HMMWVs.48th IBCT soldiers transform from heavy armor to light infantry at annual training In December 2007, the Georgia National Guard's 48th Infantry Brigade Combat Team was alerted that it would be deployed to Afghanistan in the summer of 2009 for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). In January 2009, the 2‚Äì121st began training for the expected year-long deployment. In the Spring of 2009, the unit returned to Camp Shelby, MS, the site of its World War II preparations nearly 70 years prior. The unit was subsequently deployed to Afghanistan in May. While deployed in Afghanistan, the 2‚Äì121st participated in training the Afghan National Security Forces while conducting counter insurgency operations in the North, East, and Kabul Regional Command areas of operation. In April 2010 the unit redeployed from Afghanistan and demobilized at Fort Stewart, GA. The battalion suffered 2 fatalities while deployed to Afghanistan.

Plot The novella is set in fictional rural Clay County, Mississippi, home to the Ponders, the richest family in the county. Daniel Ponder, a \\"mildly retarded man\\" according to literary scholars, is the heir to his father Sam Ponder's wealth. As Daniel generously gives away his possessions, including a gas station and heirloom watches, his father and his niece, Edna Earle Ponder, try to save their family fortune by having Daniel institutionalized to a psychiatric hospital. When Sam instead of Daniel is institutionalized by accident, the two try to have Daniel marry Teacake Magee, an eligible widow. The marriage only lasts two months. Daniel later marries 17-year-old Bonnie Dee Peacock, and Daniel's father dies of a heart attack when he hears of the proposal. Bonnie runs away, and later returns to Daniel's house. She dies mysteriously on a stormy night. The Peacocks, under the advice of district attorney Dorris Gladney, indict Daniel on murder charges. He convinces the judge he is innocent, and gives away the remainder of his riches to all present at the trial, including the Peacocks. The novella is narrated through the perspective of Edna Earle.

He used the pseudonym Stephen Oliver (Junior). Life The only son of William Chatto, a merchant who died at Gibraltar in 1804, was born at Newcastle-on-Tyne on 17 April 1799. After education at a grammar school in the north, he went into business, and around 1830 acquired the firm of his cousin, a wholesale tea-dealer, in Eastcheap, London. In 1834 he gave up business to write. Also in this year, he acquired, probably from the Atkinson family, the Henry Atkinson manuscript, an important early source of violin music, dating from the 1690s, and written in or near Newcastle. He was editor in 1839‚Äì41 of the New Sporting Magazine, and in 1844 projected a penny daily comic illustrated paper entitled: Puck, a journalette of Fun. For this paper, which he edited himself, he secured the services of contributors including Tom Taylor, but it had only a brief existence. In 1839, Chatto was elected an honorary member of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle-on-Tyne. He died in the London Charterhouse, 28 February 1864, and was buried in Highgate Cemetery. His epitaph, by his lifelong friend, Tom Taylor, described him as a \\"true-hearted and upright man\\".

John Greenwood The Telegraph, 6 October 2008. Archived here. While most wine is purchased with the intent of consuming it, some wines are purchased with the intention to resell them at a higher price in the future. Wine collectors find a fruitful asset. Walter Hamilton. Los Angeles Times, 8 December 2013. Background Ch√¢teau Margaux, a First Growth from the Bordeaux region of France, is highly collectible. Wine investment is usually conducted through one of two main methods. The first involves purchasing and reselling individual bottles or cases of particular wines (wine for investment tends to be sold in sets of 3, 6, 9, 12, or 13). The other option is purchasing shares in an investment wine fund that pools the investors' capital. In the former instance (directly buying specific cases of wine), it is recommended that inexperienced investors work with a broker, merchant, or a consultant, to minimize risk. Many authorities also publish independent guides for the investor to help navigate this investment class. Indeed, complex models and formulae have been applied to tracking investment wine's historical returns. While there may be tens of thousands of wine producers across the globe, it is estimated that perhaps only 250 produce the sort of premier wines that are worth considering as a financial investment. It is also estimated that about 90 percent of the world's investment grade wine is produced in the Bordeaux region of France, which explains why the region is the main target for investment wine fraudsters. Vintage ports historically have made up much of the rest of the market inventory, but now more and more varied and global selections of wines are finding their way into the investor market. Outstanding vintages from the best vineyards may sell for thousands of dollars per bottle, though the broader term \\"fine wine\\" covers bottles typically retailing at over about US$30‚Äì50.For example, Berry Brothers & Rudd, one of the world's largest dealers, started \\"Fine wine\\" prices at about ¬£25 in March 2009 with a wine from Au Bon Climat website \\"Fine wine offers\\". Investment wines are considered by some to be Veblen goods; that is, demand for them increases instead of decreases as the price rises. The most common wines purchased for investment include those from Bordeaux, Burgundy, cult wines from Europe and elsewhere, and Vintage port. History While premium wines have been around for centuries, the formal and organized sale and resale of the best wines for profit became a more established phenomenon in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Indeed, at least in the United States in the 1960s and early 1970s, newspaper articles about investing in wine were more likely to warn that it is illegal for individuals to sell wine, and that the \\"investment\\" would be drunk by the investor. However, by the mid-1980s, in the state of Illinois, and in special cases in California, it was legal to sell wine without a retail license, and more investors were learning how to transact their trades through legal brokers with the necessary licenses. In Europe, laws are much less restrictive regarding wine selling and reselling. Drawbacks Wine as an investment does have some concerns, including the fact that (unlike dividend-paying stocks and bonds) stored wine produces no return for the investor until it is sold, and insurance and storage costs will mean the investor is losing money while waiting for the wine's value to appreciate. There is low liquidity in US wine inventory, as most US states will only allow private wine sales through auctions, which themselves may take a commission of 15% to 25%. Investment in fine wine has attracted fraudsters both in the UK and US, who prey on their victims' ignorance of this sector of the wine market.Economist.com Fine-wine fraud. Losses by investors to rogue wine investment firms can be significant, made more acute by the fraudsters willing to re-offend. Wine fraud often works by charging excessively high prices for off-vintage or lower-status wines from famous wine regions, while claiming that it is a sound investment unaffected by economic cycles. Efforts made by regulators to stem losses to rogue investment firms include the closing down of companies in the public interest, and cease and desist orders.

Wyndham Mortimer (March 11, 1884 - August 25, 1966) was an American trade union organizer and functionary active in the United Auto Workers union (UAW). Mortimer is best remembered as a key union organizer in the 1937 Flint Sit- Down Strike. Mortimer was the First Vice President of the UAW from 1936 to 1939. A member of the Communist Party USA from about 1932, Mortimer was a critic of the efforts of the conservative American Federation of Labor to control the union and was a leader of a so-called \\"Unity Caucus\\" which led the UAW to join forces with the more aggressive Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). In the spring of 1941, Mortimer's refusal to follow the anti-strike line of the UAW's governing Executive Board during a highly controversial work stoppage at a California aircraft factory lead to his termination by the union and effectively brought an end to his career. Biography Early years Wyndham Mortimer was born March 11, 1884 in Karthaus, Pennsylvania, the son of a coal miner who was a member of the Knights of Labor, an early American labor union.Gary M. Fink (ed.), Biographical Dictionary of American Labor. Revised edition. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1984; pp. 422-423. He later recalled that one of his earliest memories of life as a young boy in Central Pennsylvania involved \\"walking behind parades of striking miners.\\"Roger Keeran, The Communist Party and the Auto Workers Unions. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1980; pg. 12. Mortimer left school at age 12 to work in the mines of Pennsylvania as a coal trapper, periodically operating trap doors in the mine shafts to allow the passage of carts and to assist with ventilation. Mortimer joined the United Mine Workers of America in 1900 and remained in the mines for several years after that date. Mortimer joined the Socialist Party of America in 1908 after hearing a campaign speech by that party's Presidential nominee, Eugene V. Debs.Keeran, The Communist Party and the Auto Workers Unions, pg. 115. After leaving the coal mines, Mortimer worked as a rail-straightener in the steel mills of Lorain, Ohio, a brakeman on the Pennsylvania and New York Central Railroads, and a conductor for the Cleveland Railway Company. During this interval Mortimer was periodically a member of the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen and the Industrial Workers of the World. Trade union career This industrial job-hopping culminated in 1917 when Mortimer was hired as a drill operator at the White Motor Company of Cleveland, Ohio, then a leading manufacturer of trucks and busses. While at White Motor, Mortimer organized his fellow workers into an independent trade union ‚Äî the White Motor Union. After first seeking assistance from the Cleveland Federation of Labor for his organizing effort, without success, in the summer of 1933 Mortimer made contact with John Williamson, the CPUSA's District Organizer for Detroit. The Communist Party lent assistance to the organizing campaign and in August 1933 the White Motor Union affiliated with the Auto Workers Union (AWU), an affiliate of the Communist Party-sponsored Trade Union Unity League. Although he never publicly acknowledged his own participation Mortimer was himself a member of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) by 1932 according to historian Roger Keeran. Outside of his workplace he was also active in the Small Home and Landowners League in Cleveland, a short-lived mass organization of the CPUSA. Unhappy at the presence of a new radical union in their midst, in November 1933 representatives of the Cleveland Metal Trades Council began circularizing White Motor workers with leaflets calling on plant workers to choose between the American Federation of Labor and the Communist-sponsored AWU.Keeran, The Communist Party and the Auto Workers Unions, pg. 116. This appeal made headway with rank-and-file workers. Mortimer, realizing that he faced a long and divisive fight over the issue, called a mass meeting of union members and himself recommended that the independent union be dissolved in favor of a new organization affiliated with the AF of L. Shortly thereafter union officials went to headquarters of the Metal Trades Council and made formal application, and Federal Local Union No. 18463 of the American Federation of Labor was thereby established. The AF of L organizer for the Cleveland district, George McKinnon, appointed conservative trade unionists to head the new local, thereby excluding Mortimer from high office. Mortimer did, however, manage to maintain a high profile and effective direction of the local's tone and agenda as the head of the Grievance Committee of the new organization. In this capacity, Mortimer was instrumental in orchestrating weekend job stoppages until the company relented and agreed to pay time-and-a-half for Saturday and Sunday work. In 1934 Mortimer was elected President of the Cleveland Auto Council. Mortimer was frequently questioned about his political affiliations and loyalties and never admitted connection to the CPUSA during his time as a union organizer.Harvey A. Levenstein, Communism, Anticommunism, and the CIO. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1985; pg. 43. When accused by a leader of the AF of L's Metal Trades Department of being a Communist in 1935, Mortimer replied: > \\"I will not dignify the wild charges made against me...by either denying or > admitting them. Redbaiting is, and always has been, the employers' most > potent weapon against those of us who believe in and fight for industrial > unionism.\\"Wyndham Mortimer, Organize! Boston: Beacon Press, 1971; pp. 82-83. > Quoted in Levenstein, Communism, Anticommunism, and the CIO, pp. 42-43. Mortimer and other Michigan Communists active in the trade union movement took pains to maintain discretion in this period, going so far as to hold their unit meetings in the middle of the night, the time and location of which was kept a carefully guarded secret.Levenstein, Communism, Anticommunism, and the CIO, pg. 45. This mania for secrecy served to inhibit CPUSA activists from placing the question of socialism before their fellow trade unionists, effectively stifling their self-proclaimed task of radicalizing the working class from the outset. At the 1936 annual convention of the United Automobile, Aircraft and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) Mortimer headed a successful drive to unseat Frances Dillon as President of the union.\\"Wyndham Mortimer Collection Papers, 1934-1973: Finding Aid,\\" Reuther Library, Wayne State University. Homer Martin was elected as new President of the UAW at that convention and Mortimer was elected First Vice President of the UAW. He was the only Communist in the UAW's top leadership.Bert Cochran, Labor and Communism: The Conflict that Shaped American Unions. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1977; pg. 109. The Sit-Down Strike and after Strikers barricaded inside of Fisher Body Company plant 3 during the 1937 Flint Sit- down Strike. Mortimer was dispatched to lead organizing efforts in Flint, Michigan, activity which directly lead to the high-profile and successful Flint Sit-Down Strike that began on December 30, 1936 and lasted well into 1937. A period of factional conflict between Mortimer and UAW President Martin followed. Martin maintained close ties with Jay Lovestone, the former Executive Secretary of the CPUSA who had lost his position in a 1929 factional war only to organize a new political organization, known from the middle of 1937 as the Independent Communist Labor League.Levenstein, Communism, Anticommunism, and the CIO, pg. 107. Lovestone managed to place a number of is loyal followers in important positions at UAW headquarters and persuaded Martin to begin a purge of his enemies in the ranks, including not only Communists such as Mortimer but those accused of being \\"tools\\" of the CPUSA, such as Victor Reuther and Walter Reuther.Levenstein, Communism, Anticommunism, and the CIO, pp. 107-108. Mortimer was expelled from the UAW in 1938 on charges levied by Homer Martin that he intended to turn over the UAW to the Communists ‚Äî an accusation which Mortimer denied. This action was soon reversed following the defeat of Martin by R.J. Thomas in his bid for re- election as head of the UAW. An additional unintended consequence soon became clear, as the attack by Martin and Lovestone essentially created a grand alliance of liberal and radical unionists which would soon take the UAW out of the AF of L and into the fledgling Congress of Industrial Organizations through a so-called \\"Unity Caucus.\\" In 1938 Mortimer was again employed as a field organizer for the UAW and placed in charge of the union's West Coast organizing effort in the burgeoning aircraft industry located there. Efforts to organize the workers at the Boeing plant in Seattle, Washington proved unsuccessful due to disagreements over jurisdiction voiced by the International Association of Machinists and Teamsters Union, but his bid to organize Vultee Aircraft for the UAW met with success. In November 1940 a strike of some 4,000 workers took place at Vultee's Downey, California plant. According to one account, the dispute between the company and the union originally was concerned with the matter of wages and the issue was rapidly resolved, but Mortimer abruptly broke off negotiations with the company over the secondary matters of grievance procedure and a no strike pledge.Max Kampelman, The Communist Party versus the CIO: A Study in Power Politics. New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1957; pp. 25-26. A 12-day work stoppage resulted which was finally resolved only when the War Department and Justice Department stepped in.Kampelman, The Communist Party versus the CIO, pg. 26. Attorney General Robert H. Jackson issued a public charge that the strike was inspired by the Communist Party. With World War II already raging in Europe, a strike at an aircraft plant in which the most famous Communist was playing a role was seen as a positive threat to national security.Levenstein, Communism, Anticommunism and the CIO, pg. 147. The tense situation was to be repeated in 1941 when Mortimer played a prominent role in a strike against the North American Aviation and its manufacturing plant located at Inglewood, California. In the face of overwhelming public sentiment and governmental pressure against the North American Aviation strike, United Auto Workers leaders sought an expeditious resolution of the situation.Levenstein, Communism, Anticommunism and the CIO, pg. 148. Mortimer was instructed by the UAW's office to energetically exert his full influence upon the strikers to end the dispute. When Mortimer refused this instruction, he was immediately fired from his post. Even this did not end the dispute, however, and President Roosevelt personally ordered the striking aircraft workers back on the job, threatening to send in federal troops if they did not return to work by Monday, June 9, 1941. Later years Mortimer's defiance of the Executive Board of the UAW had ended his career in the union.Levenstein, Communism, Anticommunism and the CIO, pg. 152. A brief stint followed as an organizer for the CIO, but Mortimer resigned from this position in 1942. Thereafter he held a number of minor union positions before retiring in 1945 at the age of 61. During his retirement years, Mortimer spent time writing and speaking on labor issues. Death and legacy Wyndham Mortimer died August 25, 1966 in Los Angeles, California.

Their disadvantages include accidental falls and uncomfortable interactions with those standing above in the main room. History Saarinen's Miller House The conversation pit was popular from the 1950s to the 1970s, seen across Europe as well as North America. Modernist architects Eero Saarinen and Alexander Girard used a conversation pit as the centerpiece of the influential Miller House (1958) in Columbus, Indiana, one of the earliest widely publicized applications of the concept. A brilliant red conversation pit (since covered, but recently restored) was later incorporated by Saarinen into the 1962 TWA Flight Center at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. Other influential residential projects include the 1955 Cohen House in Sarasota, Florida, by architect Paul Rudolph, for whom the conversation pit became a signature element, and many of Bruce Goff's houses beginning in the 1920s, including the Adah Robinson house in Tulsa, Oklahoma and the 1965 Nicol House in Kansas City, Missouri. Many conversation pits have been filled in during renovation to create a uniform floor level. The conversation-pit concept influenced the popularity of the somewhat less radical sunken living room, most familiar from the Dick Van Dyke Show on TV. In the late 1990s conversation pits and sunken living rooms were offered in home plans as a way of creating an informal space within a large space.

The Humiliation of Christ is a Protestant Christian doctrine that consists of the rejection and suffering that Jesus received and accepted, according to Christian belief. Within it are included his incarnation, suffering, death, burial, and sometimes descent into hell. State of humiliation Calvinist theology draws a distinction between Christ's \\"state of humiliation\\", which consisted of his suffering and death, and his \\"state of exaltation\\", which consisted of his resurrection, ascension, and heavenly session. According to the Westminster Shorter Catechism, Christ‚Äôs humiliation \\"consisted in his being born, and that in a low condition, made under the law, undergoing the miseries of this life, the wrath of God, and the cursed death of the cross; in being buried, and continuing under the power of death for a time.\\" The distinction between the states of humiliation and exaltation does present difficulties in explaining the idea that Christ won a victory on the cross. Peter Leithart notes that while the cross and resurrection are often thought of as a \\"U-shaped series of events\\", John's gospel, with its emphasis on the cross as the being the glorification of Christ (John 12:23), \\"pictures the death, resurrection, and ascension as points along a straight line, with a steep positive slope. The cross is not stairway that leads down, but the first step of a stairway whose head reaches into the heavens.\\"  Biblical basis  The belief of this comes from several places in the Bible. One passage says Christians interpret this as referring to the later coming of Jesus. The Epistle to the Philippians in the Christian New Testament reads: (See kenosis.)  Examples of humiliation  * Christ was put to shame at his birth. The Christian belief is that God could do anything, so the question is asked, \\"Why was Christ made so lowly by being born in a stable and laid upon a manger?\\" * Herod sent out soldiers to kill him. Jesus was saved from death as a mere baby by a miracle. The Christian belief is that this was God. * Christ was rejected by his own town's synagogue. He read from Isaiah and the people rejected him. Jesus stated that no prophet was accepted in his own town. The people were filled with wrath and tried to kill him. * Christ was put to shame for doing miracles such as casting demons out of men. * Jesus was rejected by his own people in favour of Barabbas, a criminal. He was then spat upon, beaten and mocked by the Roman soldiers. * The ultimate form of humiliation, Christ was crucified while being mocked. Humility In Early Christianity, the prevalent view of Jesus was based on the Kyrios image () as \\"the Lord and Master\\", e.g. in his Transfiguration. In the 13th century a major turning point was the development of the \\"tender image of Jesus\\" as the Franciscans began to emphasize his humility from birth in a humble setting to his death on the cross. The Nativity scene promoted by Saint Francis of Assisi portrayed a softer image of Jesus. The concept that the omnipotent Creator would set aside all power in order to conquer the hearts of men by love and that he would have been helplessly placed in a manger was touching to the believers as that of the sacrifice of dying on the cross in Calvary.

It started in 1464, after the death of Duke Otto III, the last Duke of Pomerania-Stettin. The Dukes of Pomerania- Wolgast, Eric II and Wartislaw X, held that they were Otto's rightful heirs. Elector Frederick II of Brandenburg held that Pomerania-Stettin was a fief of Brandenburg. Since its duke, Otto III, had died without a male heir, it should fall back to Brandenburg.  History  After Duke Otto III of Pomerania- Stettin had died of the plague in 1464, Frederick used his claim of suzerainty of Brandenburg over Pomerania, an issue which had never been clarified, to lay claim on Pomerania-Stettin. On 21 January 1466, the Dukes and the Elector concluded the Treaty of Soldin, in which the Elector enfeoffed the Dukes with Pomerania and they recognised him as their liege lord. The Pomeranian Dukes, however, did not meet their treaty obligations and the conflict erupted again. In 1468, Brandenburg captured several Pomeranian towns on both sides of the Oder. After an unsuccessful siege of Ueckerm√ºnde, the two sides agreed to a cease-fire. Peace negotiations in Piotrk√≥w Kujawski only resulted in an extension of the cease-fire. In May 1470, Eric II invaded the Neumark and started looting. In the meantime, Emperor Frederick III acknowledged the claims of Brandenburg. The emperor enfeoffed Frederick II with Pomerania- Stettin and ordered Eric II and Wartislaw X to recognise Frederick as their liege lord. Duke Henry IV of Mecklenburg mediated, and at the end of May 1472, a lasting peace treaty was signed at Prenzlau. The Dukes and the Estates of Pomerania had to pay homage to the Frederick II, who was also allowed to keep the territories he had conquered. The Dukes retained a number of law professors from the University of Greifswald to review the peace treaty. Among them were Johannes Parleberg, Matthias von Wedel, Sabel Siegfried the Younger, Hermann Slupwachter, Johann Elzing, Heinrich Zankenstede, and Georg Walter. Gerwin R√∂nnegarwe and Hertnidt vom Stein also played a role.Stephanie Irrgang: Der Stralsunder Ratsherr und B√ºrgermeister Dr. Sabel Siegfried. Eine Karriere im Hanseraum w√§hrend des 15. Jahrhunderts, in: Baltische Studien, new series, vol. 89, Verlag Ludwig, Kiel, 2004, , p. 34  Aftermath  The result of the conflict was unfavourable for Pomerania, despite their being allowed to retain Pomerania-Stettin, because it had to acknowledge Brandenburg's suzerainty. Bogislaw X managed to negotiate a more favourable peace for Pomerania in the Treaty of Pyritz of 1493. Brandenburg finally gave up its claim of suzerainty with the Treaty of Grimnitz in 1529. In return, the Dukes of Pomerania had to grant the succession to the Electorate of Brandenburg, in case the House of Pomerania were to die out.  References  * Hans Branig: Geschichte Pommerns.

The North Carolina Pre-Flight School was established on February 1, 1942, by the Secretary of the Navy and opened that April. The football team was later organized and competed against other military teams in addition to major college teams of the period. During their three years in existence, the Cloudbusters compiled an overall record of sixteen wins, eight losses and three ties (16‚Äì8‚Äì3). North Carolina Pre-Flight was coached by one of Notre Dame's former \\"Four Horsemen\\" and Fordham head coach Jim Crowley in 1942 and went 8‚Äì2‚Äì1. The Cloudbusters were coached by former Baylor head coach Frank Kimbrough in 1943 and went 2‚Äì4‚Äì1. In 1944, they were led by Glenn Killinger and went 6‚Äì2‚Äì1. The Cloudbusters were also known for having both future College Football Hall of Fame inductees Johnny Vaught and Bear Bryant serve as assistant coaches in 1942 and 1944 respectively. Vaught went on to coach at Ole Miss, and while there won the 1960 national championship and compiled an overall record of 190 wins, 61 losses and 12 ties (190‚Äì61‚Äì12). Bryant went on to coach at Maryland, Kentucky, Texas A&M; and Alabama, and during his career won the 1961, 1964, 1965, 1973, 1978 and 1979 national championships and compiled an overall record of 323 wins, 85 losses and 17 ties (323‚Äì85‚Äì17). 1942 season The 1942 Cloudbusters squad was led by former Fordham head coach Jim Crowley. Members of Crowley's staff included: Charles R. Soleau as backs coach, Ed Sosky as ends coach, and George McGaughey, N. J. Pierce and Johnny Vaught as line coaches. The squad finished the season with an overall record of eight wins, two losses and one tie (8‚Äì2‚Äì1). After the Cloudbusters opened the season with a 13‚Äì2 victory over Catawba, they traveled to Boston and shutout Harvard 13‚Äì0 before 7,000 fans. After a tie against Georgia Pre- Flight and a victory against NC State, the Cloudbusters lost their first game of the season against Boston College 7‚Äì6. Following their loss against the Eagles, they ran for 272 yards in a 34‚Äì0 victory over Temple before 20,000 fans at Philadelphia. The Cloudbusters would then only allow seven points over the next four games leading to their season finale against Crowley's former school, Fordham. Before 24,500 fans at Yankee Stadium, the Cadets were upset 6‚Äì0 in a defensive struggle with the only points of the game coming on a Steve Filipowicz touchdown run in the first half. Games against both Colgate and Iowa Pre-Flight included in the original schedule were canceled by the end of the season. 1943 season The 1943 Cloudbusters squad was led by former Baylor head coach Frank Kimbrough. The squad finished the season with an overall record of two wins, four losses and one tie (2‚Äì4‚Äì1). The Cadets opened their 1943 season with a pair of shutout losses. The first was a 31‚Äì0 loss to Navy before 12,231 at Thompson Stadium in Annapolis, and the second was a 42‚Äì0 loss to Duke in Durham. The Cloudbusters rebounded with a victory over Camp Davis only to lose their next two contests. The squad then finished the season with a tie against Camp Lejeune and a 21‚Äì7 victory over NC State. The game against Virginia Tech at Victory Stadium in Roanoke, Virginia included in the original schedule was canceled by the end of the season. 1944 season The 1944 Cloudbusters squad was led by head coach Glenn Killinger. Members of Killinger's staff included: Glenn Presnell as backs coach, John Roning as ends coach, and Bear Bryant as line coach. The squad finished the season with an overall record of six wins, two losses and one tie (6‚Äì2‚Äì1). The cadets opened the season with a 27‚Äì14 victory over Cherry Point MCAS, and the next week upset national championship favorite Navy before 10,000 fans at Annapolis. In the victory over the Midshipmen, Otto Graham threw a lateral pass to Frank Aschenbrenner who ran it 55-yards for the game-winning score. The next week, the squad defeated Duke 13‚Äì6 for a second consecutive upset. As a result of these upsets, the Cloudbusters earned the No. 2 ranking in the first AP Poll of the 1944 season. After being held to a tie against Virginia, the Cloudbusters rebounded with a 3‚Äì0 victory over after Buell St. John connected on a short field goal with only seven seconds remaining in the game. After a victory over, the cadets suffered their first loss of the season in a 49‚Äì20 loss against Bainbridge NTS. The Cloudbusters responded the following week with a 33‚Äì18 victory over Georgia Pre-Flight, with Graham throwing for three touchdowns and running for one in the contest. The cadets then finished the season with a loss against Camp Peary. 1945 season The 1945 Cloudbusters squad was to have been led by head coach Bear Bryant. However, Bryant never served as the head coach at Carolina after the Navy dropped the football program there in August 1945. From the Cloudbusters, Bryant took the head coaching position with Maryland, and fourteen players he coached at the Pre- Flight School enrolled to play for him at Maryland after they were discharged from the service.

The company then began working with entertainment venues and event production companies to integrate this new fabric technology and enhance the fan experience. The company continued to introduce multiple Fabric HD products, one of the most notable being SeatTux, a custom fitting fabric seat cover. This product enabled brands to communicate to the fans in attendance while simultaneously reaching the television audience when empty seats are shown during a typical broadcast. The Mirror Technology Mirrus Mirror Technology Televisions displayed behind two-way mirror glass had been available for roughly 15 years but had been isolated to the hospitality and residential markets. Mirrus had the vision of creating a mirror technology that would be utilized in high consumer traffic areas for the purposes of advertising. The company developed a mirror technology in which video ads can be scheduled and sent via the Internet to a specific mirror anywhere in the world. The Mirror Technology displays high definition video ads until a consumer approaches or engages the unit. Once engaged, the video or ad playing in the unit migrates and continues to play in the corner of the unit while the remainder screen instantly becomes a fully functioning mirror. As the consumer walks away from the mirror the video advertisement reverts to full size, until approached by the next consumer. By integrating a motion sensor to detect consumer engagement, the mirror technology can utilize this function to record and report the length of time a consumer engaged with a mirror, the location of that mirror, how long the consumer was engaged, and what video ad or ads were playing during their engagement. Providing brands and advertisers with a detailed report of consumer engagement would allow Reid to provide them with a true return on their investment. Partnerships Sports arenas and stadiums Mirris mirrors installed in the American Airlines Center in Dallas. Mirrus partnered with ISP Sports in August 2010 to install the mirror technology in the bathrooms of numerous college football stadiums including: Virginia Tech's Lane Stadium, Georgia Tech's Bobby Dodd Stadium and East Carolina's Dowdy-Ficklen stadium. Mirrus installed mirrors equipped with Mirror Image technology in the American Airlines Center in Dallas. Chicago O'Hare International Airport The company partnered with Clear Channel Airports and installed 150 mirrors in Chicago's O‚ÄôHare International Airport in October 2010. Beauty and retail venues Mirrus Mirror Technology in use at Sephora Sensorium Mirrus' technology was on display at Sephora's Sensorium event in New York in October 2011. The company introduced a new consumer driven beauty mirror and used digital advertising mirrors as displays during the week long event. Paul Mitchell Schools in Texas, Chicago, and Charlotte installed Mirrus mirrors in 2011.

Its location is the present-day island and nation of Jamaica.  Pre-Columbian Jamaica  Around 650 AD, Jamaica was colonized by the people of the Ostionoid culture, who likely came from South America.Atkinson, Lesley-Gail, The Earliest Inhabitants: The Dynamics of the Jamaican Ta√≠no. Alligator Pond in Manchester Parish and Little River in St. Ann Parish are among the earliest known sites of this Ostionoid people, who lived near the coast and extensively hunted turtles and fish. Around 950 AD, the people of the Meillacan culture settled on both the coast and the interior of Jamaica, either absorbing the Ostionoid people or co-inhabiting the island with them. The Ta√≠no culture developed on Jamaica around 1200 AD. They brought from South America a system of raising yuca known as \\"conuco.\\"Rogozinski, Jan, A Brief History of the Caribbean. To add nutrients to the soil, the Ta√≠no burned local bushes and trees and heaped the ash into large mounds, into which they then planted yuca cuttings. Most Ta√≠no lived in large circular buildings (bohios), constructed with wooden poles, woven straw, and palm leaves. The Taino spoke an Arawakan language and did not have writing. Some of the words used by them, such as barbacoa (\\"barbecue\\"), hamaca (\\"hammock\\"), kanoa (\\"canoe\\"), tabaco (\\"tobacco\\"), yuca, batata (\\"sweet potato\\"), and jurac√°n (\\"hurricane\\"), have been incorporated into Spanish and English.  Columbus  Second voyage of Columbus, 1493 Fourth voyage of Columbus, 1503 Christopher Columbus set sail on his second voyage to the Americas on September 24, 1493.\\"Christopher Columbus ‚Äì 2nd Voyage\\". On November 3, 1493, he landed on an island that he named Dominica. On November 22, he landed on Hispaniola and spent some time exploring the interior of the island for gold. He left Hispaniola on April 24, 1494, and arrived at the island of Juana (Cuba) on April 30 and Jamaica on May 5. He explored the south coast of Juana before returning to Hispaniola on August 20. After staying for a time on the western end, present-day Haiti, he finally returned to Spain.C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), pp. 25‚Äì7. Columbus returned to Jamaica during his fourth voyage to the Americas. He had been sailing around the Caribbean nearly a year when a storm beached his ships in St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica, on June 25, 1503.Black, History, pp. 27‚Äì8. For a year Columbus and his men remained stranded on Jamaica. A Spaniard, Diego Mendez, and some natives paddled a canoe to get help from Hispaniola. The island's governor, Nicol√°s de Ovando y C√°ceres, detested Columbus and obstructed all efforts to rescue him and his men. In the meantime, Columbus allegedly mesmerized the natives by correctly predicting a lunar eclipse for February 29, 1504, using the Ephemeris of the German astronomer Regiomontanus.Samuel Eliot Morison, Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus, 1942, pp. 653‚Äì54. Samuel Eliot Morison, Christopher Columbus, Mariner, 1955, pp. 184‚Äì92. Help finally arrived, from the governor, on June 29, 1504, and Columbus and his men arrived in Sanl√∫car de Barrameda, Castile, on November 7, 1504.Black, History, pp. 31‚Äì2.  New Seville  European colonies in the Caribbean in 1600 The Spanish Empire began its official governance of Jamaica in 1509. That year, Columbus's son, Diego Columbus, instructed conquistador Juan de Esquivel to formally occupy Jamaica in his name.Black, History, p. 33. Esquivel had accompanied Columbus in his second trip to the Americas in 1493 and participated in the invasion of Hispaniola. A decade later, Friar Bartolom√© de las Casas wrote Spanish authorities about Esquivel's conduct during the Hig√ºey massacre of 1503. The first Spanish settlement was founded in 1509 near St Ann's Bay and named Sevilla la Nueva, or New Seville.  St Jago de la Vega  In 1534 the settlers moved to a new, healthier site, which they named Villa de la Vega, and later St Jago de la Vega, which the English renamed Spanish Town when they conquered the island in 1655.Black, History, p. 37. This settlement served as the capital of both Spanish and English Jamaica from its foundation in 1534 until 1872, after which the capital was moved to Kingston. Other settlements established by the Spanish included Esquivel (now Old Harbour Bay, Jamaica), Oristan (Bluefields, Jamaica), Savanna-la-Mar, Manterias (Montego Bay), Las Chorreras (Ocho Rios), Oracabeza (Oracabessa), Puerto Santa Maria (Port Maria), Mellila (Annotto Bay) and Puerto Anton (Port Antonio).C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 38. In 1611, the population of Spanish Jamaica was 1,510, including 696 Spaniards, 107 free people of color, 74 Tainos, 558 black slaves, and 75 \\"foreigners\\".Frank Cundall and Joseph Pietersz, Jamaica Under the Spaniards (Kingston: Institute of Jamaica, 1919), p. 34. However, that census did not include the Taino who fled to the mountainous interior, where they mingled with freed African slaves, and became the ancestors to the Jamaican Maroons of Nanny Town.Agorsah, E. Kofi, \\"Archaeology of Maroon Settlements in Jamaica\\", Maroon Heritage: Archaeological, Ethnographic and Historical Perspectives, ed. E. Kofi Agorsah (Kingston: University of the West Indies Canoe Press, 1994), pp. 180‚Äì1. The Spaniards enslaved many of the native people, overworking and harming them to the point that many had perished within fifty years of European arrival.Black, History, pp. 34‚Äì5. Subsequently, the lack of indigenous opportunity for labour was mended with the arrival of African slaves. Disappointed in the lack of gold on the isle, the Spanish mainly used Jamaica as a military base to supply colonizing efforts in the mainland Americas. The Spanish colonists did not bring women in the first expeditions and took Ta√≠no women for their common-law wives, resulting in mestizo children. Sexual violence with the Ta√≠no women by the Spanish was also common. Although the Taino referred to the island as \\"Xaymaca,\\" the Spanish gradually changed the name to \\"Jamaica.\\"Cundall, Frank, The Story of the Life of Columbus and the Discovery of Jamaica. In the so- called Admiral's map of 1507 the island was labeled as \\"Jamaiqua\\" and in Peter Martyr's work \\"Decades\\" of 1511, he referred to it as both \\"Jamaica\\" and \\"Jamica.\\" In 1597, English privateer Anthony Shirley landed on Jamaica and plundered the island, marching on St Jago de la Vega with the help of a Taino guide, and he sacked the town.Black, History, p. 43.Cundall and Pietersz, Jamaica, p. 19. Governor Fernando Melgarejo tried to protect the island from pirate raids, and in 1603 he successfully repelled an attack by Christopher Newport.Black, History, pp. 43‚Äì4. In 1643, William Jackson (pirate) landed at Caguaya, marched on St Jago de la Vega, and plundered it.Black, History, p. 45. English conquest In late 1654, English leader Oliver Cromwell launched the Western Design armada against Spain's colonies in the Caribbean. In April 1655, General Robert Venables led the armada in an attack on Spain's fort at Santo Domingo, Hispaniola. However, the Spanish repulsed this poorly-executed attack, known as the Siege of Santo Domingo, and the English troops were soon decimated by disease. Weakened by fever and looking for an easy victory following their defeat at Santo Domingo, the English force then sailed for Jamaica, the only Spanish West Indies island that did not have new defensive works. In May 1655, around 7,000 English soldiers landed near Jamaica's Spanish Town capital. The English invasion force soon overwhelmed the small number of Spanish troops (at the time, Jamaica's entire population only numbered around 2,500).* In the following years, Spain repeatedly attempted to recapture Jamaica, and in response in 1657 the English Governor of Jamaica invited buccaneers to base themselves at Port Royal, to help defend against Spanish attacks. Spain never recaptured Jamaica, losing the Battle of Ocho Rios in 1657 and the Battle of Rio Nuevo in 1658. When the Spanish Maroon leader, Juan de Bolas, switched sides and joined the English, the Spanish acting governor Ysasi conceded defeat in his attempts to reconquer the island. For England, the Colony of Jamaica was to be the \\"dagger pointed at the heart of the Spanish Empire\\", although in fact it was a possession of little economic value then.

Thousands of Sikhs were facing police brutality hence, the Sikhs planned to defend themselves and stand up for the defenceless. Early life Gurbachan Singh Manochahal was born on 6 June 1954 at village Manochahal in Tarn Taran district in Punjab to S. Atma Singh and Gurmej Kaur. He served in the Indian Army during his youth. He was later court martialed from the army. Manochahal was shot in the arm during the 1978 Sikh‚ÄìNirankari clashes. Manochahal maintained a relationship with Damdami Taksal and became acquainted with other members of the organization, such as Amrik Singh and Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. Insurgency Shortly after Operation Blue Star, Manochahal planned with other individuals linked to Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale to form armed groups which resulted in the formation of the BTFK headed by Manochahal himself and the Khalistan Commando Force headed by Manbir Singh Chaheru. In 1986, When the movement was at its peak, the militants called the Sarbat Khalsa. The SGPC had the authority to appoint the jathedar, so the militants dissolved SGPC and appointed their own Jathedar. When that person refused do their bidding, Gurbachan Singh Manochahal appointed himself by force as jathedar (head) of the Akal Takht, which is the supreme religio-temporal seat of the Sikhs. Manochahal led a resolution at the 1986 Sarbat Khalsa to declare the resolve of a separate Sikh homeland called Khalistan and also formed a Panthic committee which would lead Sikhs per this resolution. In 1992, a separate Panthic committee headed by Dr. Sohan Singh was formed. It was supported by Babbar Khalsa. It called for the boycott of the 1992 Punjab Legislative Assembly election. Elections resulted in a Congress Government under Beant Singh of the Congress Party. The formation of this committee undermined the influence of Manochahal who was criticized for his support for political participation and led to a divide between the armed groups within Punjab. Per Maloy Krishna Dhar, a former Joint Director, Intelligence Bureau, India, he was given the task to negotiate with Gurbachan Singh Manochahal. He contacted Manochahal through a journalist source, was blindfolded and taken a few hundred kilometres from Amritsar to meet with him where he secretly held negotiations for three hours before he was blindfolded again and transported back.

He became Amirul Muminin after the Jihad of Shehu Usman dan Fodiyo, succeeding Magajin Haladu, the last ruler of the centuries-old Habe dynasty, which founded by founded by Muhammadu Korau. Ummaru was succeeded by his son Saddiku. Biography Ummaran Dallaje was the first Fulani emir as well as the patriarch of the Dallazawa dynasty. He was born in the town of Dallaje, approximately 50km from Katsina, his father's name was Abdulmumini. Ummaru's grandparents migrated from the Kanem-Bornu empire and originally belonged to an Arab tribe from Ouaddai currently part of the Republic of Chad. When Ummarun‚Äôs grandparents arrived in Katsina, they first settled in a village called Makar and later moved to Dasije after which they settled at Dallaje. Education He started studying the Qur'an at a very early age, he later traveled far and studied under several scholars including Dan Fodio. After completing his studies, he started preaching within and outside Katsina. In 1804, Shehu Usman Dan Fodio declared Jihad against the Habe rulers of Hausa Kingdoms. Among the first people to answer the Shehu's call and declare their support was Mallam Ummaru. When jihad broke out in 1804, Malam Ummarun Dallaje who is a strong supporter of Shebu Ibn Fodio drew his support largely from the towns of Dallaje, Rugar Bade, Sabon Gari and other surrounding settlements. Shehu Usman Dan Fodio declared Jihad against the Habe rulers of Hausa Kingdoms. Among the first people to answer the Shehu's call and declare their support for Ummaru. Attacks At the end of 1805, Ummarun Dallaje met with a group of Jihadists which camped at ‚ÄòYantumaki. He told them that he was sent by Muhammad Bello with a message that they should continue to fight. As a result, they started to launch expeditions in areas where support could easily be obtained. They attacked a settlement only if the inhabitants rejected their call for support. They usually announced their arrival with a call to prayer outside the town. Later, they called a meeting with the leaders of the community. At such meetings, the inhabitants were urged to revive the Sunnah and enforce the Shariah, they were called upon to support Shehu ibn fodio. Around 1806, a meeting of Jihad Commanders from Katsina, Kano, Zazzau and other parts of Hausaland was convened at Birnin Gada. The meeting was initially scheduled to take place at Magami (Mani LG) where Shehu was to attend but because of his old age, he could not undertake the long and hazardous journey from Gwandu. Therefore, he sent Muhammadu Bello to represent him. During the meeting, Bello urged each Jihad Commander to take an oath to obey his instructions and to follow the Sunnah in everything, every time and under all circumstances. In his message, Shehu ibn fodio emphasized that Allah would make them victorious but warned them not to become corrupted like the rulers they were fighting and to avoid injustice, envy and disunity. The Jihadists moved closer and held a siege on the Capital of Katsina by cutting off food supply to the city. This situation, coupled with the poor harvest recorded that year, forced many people to leave the town. When the situation became tense, the Sarkin Katsina fled to Dankama, and the Jihadists moved in and took over the capital. They later launched an attack on Dankama but failed to capture the town. From Dankama, the Sarki launched a counterattack on the reformers which forced them to abandon the capital and retreat to Sabon Gari. After their victory, the Sarkin Katsina did not show any interest to resettle there. He returned to Dankama where he received assistance from Sarkin Kance. From his base at Sabon Gari, Ummarun Dallaje mapped out the next strategy to follow after his surprise defeat by Sarkin Katsina. Later, a contingent under the renown warrior Malam Muhammadu Namoda arrived from Zamfara, while others arrived from Kano and Daura. The combined contingents marched against Sarkin Katsina at Dankama where a fierce battle took place in which Sarkin Katsina Magajin Halidu and many of his chiefs were killed. His remaining forces and followers fled to Kwargom, a vassal kingdom of Zinder, where they appointed another Sarki. The Jihadists pursued and rounded them up and the Sarki fell into a well and died. The remaining supporters escaped to Damagaram where they appointed Dankasawa, the son of Tsaga-rana as their leader in order to maintain their cohesion. After the defeat of Sarkin Katsina, the Jihadists turned their attention to the eastern part of the Kingdom where they attacked a number of towns that had not been conquered. Their first place of call was Mani where the ruler of the town known as Mani Ibrahim Arne refused to surrender to Ummarun Dallaje. In the ensuing encounter, Mani Arne was killed. Rise to the throne Towards the end of 1807, the Amirul Muminin Shehu Usmanu Danfodio, appointed Ummarun Dallaje as the Emir of Katsina. By this appointment, Ummarun Dallaje became the first Fulani Emir and founder of Dallazawa Dynasty. When he settled down, he ordered an expedition against the towns of Maska and Gozaki, and brought them under control by 1810: one of the first things he did was to build a new Juma‚Äôat mosque in Katsina. Thereafter, he introduced several measures, which laid the foundation of the new Emirate. Mallam Umarun Dallaje was Shehu Danfodio's flag-bearer who in company of others conquered and sacked the habe rulers and become the first fulani Emir of Katsina, thereby establishing the Dallawaza Dynasty which ruled Katsina for 100 years (1806-1906). Malam Abdulmumin dan Muhammadu Goshi's son Mallam Umaran Dallaje was born in 1781 at Dallaje village of Bindawa, Katsina state. He had his early Islamic education under the tutelage of his father, Mallam Abdulmumin. With emergence of Shehu Usman Danfodio, Mallam Ummarun Dallaje decided to join Shebu Usman Danfodio's quest to further his knowledge on Islamic studies and to also give his contribution to the shehu in his effort to sanitise and reform the deteriorating state of affairs in the practice and teaching of the religion of Islam in Hausaland. While with shehu, Mallam Ummarun Dallaje close friends with him and planned to extend that he was one of the disciples appointed to carry and keep custody of the shehu's book during preaching expeditions. They travelled together extensively until Mallam Umarun Dallaje become one of the famous commanders of the shehu's forces who facilitated the conquest of the jihad. Mallam Ummarun Dallaje was one of the chief strategists at the famous battle of Tafkin Kwato which was the shehu's first victorious battle. Mallam Ummarun's high level activity in the planning and execution of the jihad and his commitment and bravery in the ensuring battles of the jihad earned him the confidence of the shehu and this resulted in his appointment by Sultan Muhammadu Bello to lead the battles of Alwasa and Alkalawa, both of which were victorious. The struggles continued like this and it was at the peak of these exploits that the jihad movement for the conquest of Katsina was planned and ordered by the Shehu and Mallam Umaru naturally become the leader of the expedition. He conquered and took over Katsina in the Islamic month of Rajab in 1806, while the sacked habe rulers fled to maradi in the present Republic of Niger. This development ushered the Katsina emirate into the fold of the sokoto caliphate with Malam Ummarun Dallaje as the flagbearer of the caliphate and therefore the Amir (Emir) of Katsina. He faced the task of consolidation of the Emirate and the institutionalization of leadership based on the principles of Islamic teachings and jurisprudence. In his desire to administer the Emirate in equity and justice, Mallam Ummarun Dallaje wrote to Sultan Muhammad Bello asking him for advice on leadership in Islam. Usul al-Siyasa Sultan Muhammad Bello's reply to Mallam Umarun Dallaje was the famous literature on leadership in the caliphate known as \\"Usul al-Siyasa\\", the opening paragraph of which started thus: \\"Ummarun Dallaje, a man who strives in the course of Allah with sincerity and zeal may Allah help him, prolong his high position and power give him aid from His spirit and multiply the number of his supporters to write for him some words in connection with. The principles of siyasa and the mode of conduct for a sincere man in matter connected with leadership...\\" Sultan Muhammad Bello went further to say: \\"Know, my brother that one of the most serious misfortunes that may possibly fall on a servant (of Allah) is to be a leader Amir or an emir\\". The Usul al-Siyasa was written by Muhammad Bello to guide Ummarun Dallaje and successive Emirs of Katsina on matters of politics and leadership. The book explains that rulers are blessed by God, while a tyrannical and unjust ruler is abhorred by Him, and totally doomed. With numerous quotations from Hadith, Bello highlights God‚Äôs strong dislike for unjust rulers and the inevitable punishment awaiting them. The book also explains the principles of politics and deliverance in matters of politics: * The first principle of Muslim leadership is the establishment of an order in human society through the implementation of the divine law, and obedience to the Sunnah of Muhammad. * Secondly, the Muslim leader should be firm, gentle and generous. * Thirdly, the ruler should keep company of devout Ulama and listen to their advice. * The fourth principle deals with the relationship between the Emir and his subjects. Muhammad Bello warned Ummarun Dallaje to be careful in his selection of administrators, and closely supervise them. He said majority of them are slaves to their stomachs, and would use the Emir for their own ends, and desert him the moment power is taken away from him. Muhammadu Bello made it an important duty of the Emir to see that the spirit of justice is inculcated among the people. He pointed out that people who are unjust towards one another get an unjust Government. The duty of the Emir is to forbid what is wrong and order what is right. But this should be carried out without harshness. Muhammadu Bello said that people should not be condemned or punished on account of marginal errors or deviation. But the responsibility of the Emir to procure and safeguard the welfare of his people does not end with the spiritual and social aspects of their lives, it extends to their material and economic well-being. The publication helped greatly in laying the political, social and economic foundation of not only in Katsina emirate, but up till now serve as a reference document on good governance world over. Mallam Ummaru died in 1835.

It presents the grisly discovery of more than 400 mutilated skeletons at the Aztec site of Zultapec, Mexico. It purports to show that the 500-year- old discovery ‚Äúpaints a new picture of the violent relations between the Aztecs and the Conquistadors and rewrites much of what we thought we knew about the Aztec civilization‚Äù.\\"PBS's Secrets of the Dead Revisits Mexico's Aztec Massacre\\", NYDailyNews.com; April 23, 2008. The accuracy of many of the program's assertions, however, has been questioned. Content Aztec Massacre presents a mix of interviews, historical re-enactments and computer-generated images woven together by a narrator. It follows the travels and investigations of ‚Äúoutside expert‚Äù Elizabeth Baquedano and interviews archeologists, anthropologists, history and forensics experts and other scientists. Baquedano visits archives, archeological sites and the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) in Mexico City. She talks to Enrique Martinez (site excavator), Magali Civera (an osteologist), Carmen Aguilera (a scholar and authority on the Florentine Codex), and Adrian Locke (Curator at the Royal Academy of Arts in London). The documentary centers on Martinez and his archaeological excavations at Zultepec, about 60 miles from Mexico City. A mass Aztec grave of at least 400 bodies had remained undisturbed there for around 500 years until archeologists began exploring the site. At least 40 of the bodies were discovered to be European and 10 of those were females. The mass grave contained dismembered bodies with vertebra, pelvic and femur bones missing from the skeletons. All the bodies show evidence of ritual killing, where the chest was opened up with a knife and the bodies were mutilated. More than two-dozen skulls are pierced through the temples, suggesting they were hung as trophies. The first Spanish in Mexico were led by Hern√°n Cort√©s and the Aztecs were ruled by the powerful Moctezuma II. The documentary re-enacts how the Aztecs, although highly uncertain as to how to respond, believed Cortes was fulfilling an ancient prophecy as a returning god when he abruptly appeared in 1519. They gave him precious gifts and entertained the Spanish lavishly. Cort√©s initially had an all-male crew, but a second party, following him out of Cuba, had women with them, which helps date the mass grave. In 1520, this caravan of Spanish soldiers ‚Äî among them women, children, slaves and local followers ‚Äî was abandoned by Cort√©s, as he rushed back to the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan (modern-day Mexico City) to put down a native uprising. The findings at Zultepec, plus evidence in ancient documents (Aztec codices depicting ritualistic displays of human sacrifice), show that the abandoned Spanish were captured and offered to the Aztec gods, along with natives from local tribes who were helping the Spanish against their Aztec masters. The Aztecs practiced human sacrifice and the documentary narrates how Cort√©s wrote about how the victim's chest was opened while they were alive and their still beating heart offered as sacrifices. Cannibalism followed. The film indicates that, because history is \\"written by the victors\\", there is an impression that the Aztecs simply let the Spanish take them over without a fight. The new evidence suggests instead that they fought hard to resist conquest. Criticism The film has been criticized for both contextual misrepresentations and factual errors. Contextual distortions *Critics contend that the program presents long-known facts as sensational, newly discovered information. Mart√≠nez first published the sacrificial remains in 1993 and published his identification of some of them as Spaniards in 2003. Aztec ritual sacrifice, cannibalism and the reasons they were performed were not breaking news in 2008. Baquedano, however, is presented as uncovering shocking new insights. She is shown, for example, \\"discovering\\" an illustration in Bernardino de Sahag√∫n's Florentine Codex (1545‚Äì1590) and thus figuring out the meaning of the Zultepec finds. But the illustration (a well- published figure showing Spaniards and horses on a skull rack, very familiar to Aztec scholars and students), was well-known long before the Zultepec discoveries. (The presence of sacrificed European women at Zultepec, however, represents an authentic new discovery.) *The film repeatedly references, as it main theme, a supposed long-standing misconception that the Aztecs put up little resistance to their conquest by the Spaniards. This is the notion that the new research is supposed to have \\"turned on its head\\". But it is not clear who is supposed to have held this misconception or when, since ample evidence from historical accounts has always depicted an intense and bloody war of conquest that went on for nearly two years, and in which both Aztecs and Spanish suffered heavy casualties. Bernal Diaz del Castillo wrote, in his stirring The True History of the Conquest of New Spain (mid-1550s-1568), a detailed description of the many fierce battles fought with the Aztecs during the course of the conquest. Cortes‚Äô original letters also provide ample evidence of the same events. The eventual capture of Tenochtitlan was a murderous affair featuring block by block fighting and heavy losses on both sides. During this fighting, Spanish soldiers were captured, and first hand accounts are known from Spanish participants who saw their captured comrades being sacrificed. (See, for example, La Noche Triste.) The idea that Aztec scholars have ever believed anything else is false. (The idea that historians distorted the story of the conquest by omitting the fierce resistance to the Spanish put up by the Aztecs could be interpreted as an example of the \\"Black Legend\\".) *The defeat of the Aztecs and the collapse of their empire, or alliance, are presented without any reference to the overwhelming scientific evidence that European diseases ‚Äì most notably smallpox ‚Äî preceded Cortez's trip to the Aztec capital. Disease was what rendered the Aztecs vulnerable to attack by such a small troop of Spanish mercenaries. Aztec resistance collapsed only after they began dying in large numbers from smallpox. *The film postulates that the skeletonized victims uncovered at Zultepec were remnants of the 1520 P√°nfilo de Narv√°ez expedition sent to Mexico by the Governor of Cuba to subdue and arrest Cortez. (The film does not mention Narv√°ez by name.) There are known, however, to have been other, later groups of Spaniards landing at Veracruz and joining Cortes in his siege of Tenochtitlan. These are not mentioned in the film and there is no reason the remains could not be from one of these. *The soundtrack of the film is dominated by son and meringue music. As these originate in Cuba and the Dominican Republic, respectively, they introduce another discordant element into a film about Mexico and Spain. Factual errors *In the film, Cortez is said to have \\"conquered Cuba\\" prior to coming to Mexico. The conquest of Cuba was accomplished by Diego Vel√°zquez de Cu√©llar, whom Cortez served as an aide. * The highly photogenic site of Teotihuacan ‚Äî about 30 miles to the northeast of present-day Mexico City ‚Äî is presented in the film as \\"the center for Aztec sacrifice\\". But it is well established that Teotihuacan was not an Aztec city at all, predating the Aztecs by hundreds of years. It had been abandoned for centuries when the Aztecs first arrived in the Valley of Mexico. Evidence of human sacrifice has been found there, but archeologists have not identified what group or culture was responsible. In the film, Baquedano stands in the center of the site's \\"Avenue of the Dead\\" discussing Aztec sacrifice, leaving the distinctly false impression that it happened there. (The pyramids there were not each dedicated to a particular god in the Aztec pantheon, as the narrator says. It is not yet clear what purpose most of those pyramids served for their non-Aztec builders.) *The narrator refers to a site at Tenochtitlan ‚Äî the Aztec capital ‚Äî as the \\"Templo Mejor\\" (\\"better temple\\"), rather than the correct \\"Templo Mayor\\" (\\"main temple\\"). *The film repeatedly refers to the idea that the Spanish Conquistadors were seen as gods by the Aztecs, who for that reason (and others) put up little resistance to their conquest. But this material ‚Äî the \\"Return of Quetzalcoatl\\" myth ‚Äî is controversial and many consider it discredited.Townsend, Camilla (2003), \\"Burying the White Gods: New perspectives on the Conquest of Mexico\\", In: The American Historical Review 108 (3). There are original, native sources mentioning omens of this kind, but these are post-1519. And even these suggest some confusion as to whether Moctezuma thought the Spanish were gods, and if so, which ones. (The regalia sent to Cortes by Moctzuma included that of Quetzalcoatl, Tlaloc, and Huitzilopochtli, so it's not known which deity, if any, might have been involved). The legend, which originated in a 1552 document in Spain written by Francisco L√≥pez de G√≥mara, may have been invented to justify the conquest (there are Christian elements, possibly the influence of the Spanish on the narrative) and to explain the Spanish victory (by blaming Moctezuma and his foolishness for destroying the Aztec state). *The film states that Cortez heard of the death of Moctezuma on his way back to Tenochtitlan after defeating Narvaez. But all historical accounts agree that Moctezuma was still alive when Cortez returned to Tenochtitlan, although there is uncertainty about the circumstances of Moctezuma's subsequent death.

Butler has three YouTube channels, two of which (\\"shaycarl\\" and \\"SHAYTARDS\\") have over three million subscribers. Butler and Corey Vidal developed a documentary called Vlogumentary on a $200,000+ budget that was funded with an Indiegogo campaign and raised by mostly from his viewers. Vlogumentary was released on April 20, 2016. Forbes called Butler one of the \\"most successful video entrepreneurs on YouTube\\" and in 2011 The New York Times featured Butler's production company Maker Studios. Early life Shay Carl Butler was born on March 5, 1980, in Logan, Utah to Carl and Laurie Butler. Butler is the oldest of four children. His siblings Casey, Carlie, and Logan are all active in the YouTube community. Casey Butler (caseylavere) is married to Kayli Butler (HeyKayli). Carlie Wood (CarlieStylez and WhatsUpWoods) each have over 500,000 subscribers on their YouTube channels, while Logan Butler (LoganMckay55) has just under 400,000. At the age of four, Butler's family moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and subsequently to Pocatello, Idaho. After graduating from high school, Butler served a full- time, two year mission in Barbados, Trinidad and Guyana for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He briefly attended Idaho State University, but dropped out to start working on his own. Prior to appearing on YouTube, Butler installed granite countertops for a living and worked as a school bus driver. He also worked as a radio DJ for Z103. YouTube popularity Butler became more popular on YouTube after Philip DeFranco watched one of his videos and gave him a shout-out. The shout-out resulted in a rise of Butler's subscribers and a friendship with DeFranco. By working with other YouTubers at The Station, Butler more than quadrupled his subscribers. Butler later joined the YouTube Partner Program and co-founded Maker Studios. In November 2009, he collaborated with Midi Mafia to create a flash mob at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas. In 2009, Butler's \\"SHAYTARDS\\" channel won \\"Best YouTube Channel or Personality\\" at Mashable's 3rd annual Open Web Awards. In 2013, the same channel was one of the nominees in the \\"Best Non-Fiction or Reality Series\\" category of the 3rd Streamy Awards.

In February 2013, actor Matt Damon made a guest appearance in one of Butler's vlogs after he and Damon had collaborated on a video to promote a Water.org project. Butler sometimes creates sponsored videos, in which he promotes brands or companies in exchange for financial benefits, including with General Electric, Foot Locker, Kia and Skype. In 2014 the Shay Carl YouTube channel was listed on New Media Rockstars Top 100 Channels, ranked at #31. In late 2015, Shay, along with his 12-year- old son Gavin, wrote a lifestyle, self-help book, Fat Dad, Fat Kid. On September 28, 2016, Butler announced that he will suspend the Shaytards YouTube channel for one year on March 5, 2017, which is the date of his 37th birthday. On February 12, 2017, Butler announced he would be leaving YouTube for the time being. In his announcement on his Twitter page, Butler said that due to alcoholism, his \\"purpose is to rehab\\". International Business Times ran a story about Carl allegedly exchanging sexual messages through Twitter with an adult webcam model named Aria Nina. The Shaytards channel became active again in March 2018 with a video where Shay and his wife Colette talk about their relationship and the YouTube channel, and the family announced they would start uploading videos again, but would \\"take it one day at a time\\" and not commit to a daily vlog schedule.

It was created between 1959 and 1965, by cross-breeding Buff Orpingtons with the commercial strain known in Italy as \\"White America\\". History The Robusta Lionata was created between 1959 and 1965 at the Stazione Sperimentale di Pollicoltura, or experimental chicken breeding centre, of Rovigo, in the Veneto. It was conceived as a dual-purpose breed, and derived from crossing the Buff Orpington with a commercial strain widely raised in Veneto in the 20th century, known in Italy as \\"White America\\". The White America is believed to have been based on mutant white Barnevelders, with contributions from White Leghorn, Rhode Island White and White Rock stock; in early 2012 it was no longer considered a breed. A standard for the Robusta Lionata was published by the now defunct Associazione Nazionale Allevatori Specie Avicole, or national association of breeders of avian species, in the latter part of the 20th century, and is published for historic interest on the website of the Federazione Italiana Associazioni Avicole, the federation of Italian poultry associations, the authority governing poultry breeding in Italy. In early 2012, the breed was not officially recognised by the FIAV. Together with the P√©poi, the Ermellinata di Rovigo, the Robusta Maculata and the Padovana, the Robusta Lionata is one of the five chicken breeds included in the CO.VA. project of Veneto Agricultura, the regional administration for agriculture of the Veneto. The project includes among its aims the conservation of local avian species of limited distribution, and the conservation of genetic resources and biodiversity, and has published a detailed description of the breed. Breed numbers remain low. A study published in 2007 used a figure of approximately 700 for the total breeding stock, of which approximately 200 were cocks. Characteristics The Robusta Lionata broadly resembles a Buff Orpington, with the difference that it has yellow skin and legs, which are traditionally preferred by Italian consumers of chicken meat. According to the old ANSAV standard, the Robusta Lionata is a warm buff colour. The tail and wing-tips are black with dark green lights. The skin and legs are yellow, the ear-lobes are red. The comb is single and medium-large, with 5‚Äì6 points. Average weight is for cocks, for hens. The more recent description by Veneto Agricultura gives greater weights: 4.0‚Äì4.5 kg for cocks and 2.8‚Äì3.3 kg for hens. The eggs are salmon-coloured and weigh 55 g or more. Uses The Robusta Lionata is a dual-purpose breed. Hens lay 160‚Äì170 eggs per year. In meat production, birds reach a weight of 1.9‚Äì2.0 kg in four months. Cross- breeding Robusta Lionata cocks with Barred Plymouth Rock hens produces an auto-sexing first-generation hybrid.

Along with Robert Muise, he is co-founder and senior counsel of the American Freedom Law Center. He is also general counsel to the Center for Security Policy in Washington, D.C., a national security think tank founded by Frank Gaffney. An Orthodox Jew from Brooklyn, Yerushalmi has been highly critical of liberal Jews, \\"progressive elites\\", and black people and has been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as \\"a key figure in the U.S. anti-Muslim hate movement\\". Career Public policy In the 1990s, Yerushalmi was of counsel and senior policy research director for the Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies, an Israeli free-market think tank with offices in Jerusalem and Washington, D. C. Yerushalmi published an article on sharia-compliant finance Islamic law as a \\"Black Box\\" in the Utah Law Review (2008, Issue 3). Yerushalmi has no formal training in Sharia law. American laws for American courts Yerushalmi is the principal drafter of the American laws for American courts model legislation, which is an effort to prevent courts from taking foreign or international law into account; the legislation is aimed at banning sharia, Muslim religious law. The legislation has been enacted into law in several states, including Louisiana, Tennessee, Arizona, Kansas, and Oklahoma. The American Bar Association (ABA) generally opposes such legislation proposed by Yerushalmi because it is \\"duplicative of safeguards that are already enshrined in federal and state law\\". Furthermore, the ABA states: \\"Initiatives that target an entire religion or stigmatize an entire religious community, such as those explicitly aimed at 'Sharia law', are inconsistent with some of the core principles and ideals of American jurisprudence.\\" Litigation Dearborn missionaries Yerushalmi has been involved in filing several lawsuits against the city of Dearborn, Michigan, in response to treatment of Christian missionaries preaching to Muslims at the city's Arab Festival. Members of one group, Acts 17 Apologetics, had been arrested for disturbance of the peace; a jury acquitted them, and Yerushalmi's suit against the city resulted in the latter settling with a public apology and $300,000 in damages. A judge threw out a similar case Yerushalmi had filed the same year on behalf of a group called Bible Believers; Yerushalmi had sued after the group were asked to leave the festival after speaking for over an hour, due to concerns of public safety and order. The case is currently being appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Bus advertisement controversies Yerushalmi has represented the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI), an organization founded by Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer, in several legal actions against various transportation authorities around the country. The lawsuits stem from transportation authorities' decision not to run proposed advertisements by AFDI, including one advertisement in Detroit that promotes a website recommending \\"refuge from Islam\\". On January 31, 2012, Yerushalmi's legal group, the American Freedom Law Center (AFLC) filed a request for a preliminary injunction in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of the State of New York (MTA), seeking to have the MTA run an AFDI \\"pro-Israel / anti-Jihad\\" bus advertisement. On Friday, July 20, 2012, federal judge Paul Engelmayer ruled that the MTA violated the First Amendment rights of AFDI when it rejected their advertisement. In July 2012, Engelmayer issued a final ruling, striking down the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York‚Äôs (MTA) \\"no- demeaning speech\\" restriction and ordering the MTA to display the advertisement. The judge‚Äôs order converted an earlier preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction, and it declared that the MTA speech regulation violated the First Amendment right to free speech. The judge also awarded FDI nominal damages. Yerushalmi's subsequent effort to get advertisements critical of Islam to run on MTA property failed, after the agency changed its ad policy to prohibit bigoted material, which was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On September 20, the American Freedom Law Center filed a federal lawsuit against the Washington Metro Area Transit Authority (WMATA) after the agency had refused to run similar proposed advertisement. WMATA had refused to run the advertisement \\"due to the situations happening around the world at this time\\", referring to the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi and other uprisings in the Middle East. On October 5, federal judge Rosemary M. Collyer, sitting in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted the Law Center's request on behalf of its clients for an injunction to halt WMATA's censorship of the advertisement. Collyer ordered the \\"Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority [to] display Plaintiffs‚Äô advertisement no later than 5 p.m. on October 8, 2012.\\" Pamela Geller defamation case Yerushalmi represented anti-Islam activist Pamela Geller in a $10 million defamation lawsuit filed by Omar Tarazi, the lawyer for Rifqa Bary's parents. Geller, while blogging about the controversy extensively given her work at the American Freedom Defense Initiative, had criticized Tarazi during the Rifqa Bary litigation, which arose after the 17-year-old Rifqa converted from Islam to Christianity and ran away from her Ohio home in the summer of 2009 to take refuge with Christian friends in Florida. Bary had alleged that her father threatened to murder her in an honor killing. The case was settled out of court, with both sides claiming victory, when Geller agreed to remove the posts from her blog in exchange for the case being dropped. Challenges to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act In July 2014, the American Freedom Law Center sued Barack Obama, alleging that the Obama administration had violated its constitutional duty to \\"faithfully execute\\" the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act). On May 15, 2015, the court dismissed the lawsuit for lack of standing. In 2014, Yerushalmi and Muise took over the appeal of Cutler v. United States Department of Health and Human Services, another constitutional challenge to the ACA. The challenger in that case, Jeffrey Cutler, had a personal (but not religious) objection to the ACA's requirement that he buy insurance, and \\"filed suit challenging the religious exemption in the Affordable Care Act as an unconstitutional establishment of religion.\\" The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected Cutler's claims, holding that his Establishment Clause claim failed on the merits and that he lacked standing to pursue an Equal Protection Clause claim.Cutler v. U.S. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 797 F.3d 1173, 1179. (D.C. Cir. 2015). On 2012, Yerushalmi and Muise of the AFLC represented Priests for Life (a Catholic anti-abortion organization) in a suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York challenging the contraceptive mandate provision of the ACA. The case was dismissed by U.S. District Judge Frederic Block for lack of ripeness because the government stated that the new implementing regulations would not be finalized until August 1, 2013. However, according to Yerushalmi, Priests for Life did secure a stipulation of non-enforcement from the government as a result of AFLC's motion for a preliminary injunction. Constitutional challenge to bailout of AIG Yerushalmi, as co-counsel, filed a federal lawsuit in 2009 against the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, challenging a portion of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 that appropriated $40 billion to fund the federal government‚Äôs majority ownership interest in AIG. The lawsuit argued that the use of taxpayer dollars to fund Sharia-based loans made by AIG subsidiaries violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. While federal Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff rejected the request by the U.S. Department of Justice to dismiss the lawsuit, he ultimately granted summary judgment for the government in January 2011, finding that the religious involvement did not achieve the \\"excessive entanglement\\" required under earlier rulings. The decision was appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals; on June 1, 2012, the Court of Appeals dismissed the case, ruling that the plaintiff did not have standing. On October 12, 2012, Yerushalmi and the American Freedom Law Center filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court, asking the Court to review the appellate court's decision, which the Court denied. Allegations of racism The Anti-Defamation League and Southern Poverty Law Center have described Yerushalmi's views as racist, anti- immigrant, and anti-Islamic. He stated, in a 2006 essay, that \\"most of the fundamental differences between the races are genetic\\". Yerushalmi is against what he views as a politically correct culture that doesn't openly discuss the reasons \\"the founding fathers did not give women or black slaves the right to vote.\\" According to the SPLC, Yerushalmi has called blacks \\"the most murderous of peoples\\", and reportedly once called for undocumented immigrants to be placed in \\"special criminal camps\\", detained for three years, and then deported. Yerushalmi has denied ever having made racist statements. In 2011, he was listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as one of 10 people in the United States' Anti-Muslim Inner Circle. That same year, the Center for American Progress (CAP), a progressive Washington-based think-tank, published the widely-read report Fear, Inc.: The Roots of the Islamophobia Network in America, disclosing a network of anti-Islamic and anti-Muslim activists and campaigners, and their financiers, among which Yerushlami has significant place. The report was published as an online presentation Islamophobia Network. In 2015, CAP published an updated version, \\"Fear, Inc. 2.0\\".

Within the Mahayana Abhidharma tradition, krodha is identified as one of the twenty subsidiary unwholesome mental factors. It is defined as an increase of anger (Sanskrit: pratigha) that causes one to prepare to harm others.Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 862-871.Kunsang (2004), p. 27. According to Herber Guenther, the difference between anger (pratigha) and fury (krodha) is that anger is a vindictive or hostile attitude in one's mind, but fury is an increase in anger when the chance for harming is at hand and is it very agitated state of mind leading to actual physical harm. Alexander Berzin states: :Hatred (khro-ba) is a part of hostility (dvesha) and is the harsh intention to cause harm.Berzin (2006) Note that according to Berzin, dvesha is a sub-category of anger (pratigha).

Family  Miletiƒá was born in Kaƒá, Military Frontier, Habsburg Monarchy. Miletiƒá's grandfather was Mileta Zavi≈°iƒá who came to Baƒçka from Kostajnica where he led a company of three hundred men and fought against Ottomans for thirty two years. Since Ottomans wanted to punish him after they signed a peace treaty with Austrians, Mileta emigrated to Baƒçka and changed his last name to Miletiƒá. Mileta's son Sima, who was a merchant educated in Novi Sad, had fifteen sons and three daughters. Avram Miletiƒá was the oldest Sima's son. The second son of Avram Miletiƒá, also Sima like his grandfather, was a boot-maker and a father of Svetozar Miletiƒá the political leader of Serbs in Vojvodina.  Biography  Avram Miletiƒá completed his merchant's education, first in Vidin and later in Novi Sad. In period 1785‚Äî1787 Avram Miletiƒá has been a teacher in two schools in two different villages, Lok and Vilovo, at the same time (he lectured in one school in the morning and another in the afternoon). He married a local priest's daughter and opened a general store in Mo≈°orin.  Work  In period 1778‚Äî1781 Avram Miletiƒá composed a miscellany of 129 songs (). It contains many Serbian language lyric poems and four folk epic poems: \\"A history of Prince Lazar from Kosovo and from Tzar Murat\\", \\"A history of Musiƒá Stefan\\", \\"A history of the Duke Momƒçilo\\" and \\"A history of the Young Prodanoviƒá\\", which have been noted down around thirty years before Vuk Karad≈æiƒá started recording epic poems. Miletiƒá named all folk epic songs he recorded as histories because they have been considered as histories in the form of poems. Epic song \\"History of the Young Prodanoviƒá\\" is in fact well known song \\"Serbs in Donauw√∂rth\\" () recorded in 1744 by Hristofor Zhefarovich. Miletiƒá's miscellany is considered as the oldest known songbook of urban poetry. Miletiƒá has recorded a famous ballad \\"Omer and Merima\\" only five or six years after Alberto Fortis recorded it for the first time. He has also recorded a text of the poem Pa≈°halija composed by Jovan Avakumoviƒá in 1775.

Inhabited since the 1850s, Mount Magazine first became part of the Ouachita National Forest in 1938, was re-designated as part of the Ozark National Forest in 1941, and became a state park after a 22-year conversion process from the U.S. Forest Service to the Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism. Mount Magazine State Park is the highest park in Arkansas. The park contains Mossback Ridge, including the peak of Mount Magazine (called Signal Hill) which contains The Lodge at Mount Magazine, cabins, trails, and a hang gliding area. History Native Americans inhabited the mountain seasonally, often opting to permanently settle in the Arkansas River Valley surrounding the ridge. The Homestead Act of 1862 opened the mountain to settlers who began to populate the area, and the Summer Home School was opened in the late 1800s. The nearby town of Magazine was platted in 1900. The Great Depression forced many settlers off the mountain, with the Resettlement Administration eventually purchasing all private property on the mountain in 1934. In 1938, Franklin Roosevelt reallocated the land to the U.S. Forest Service and the Works Progress Administration (WPA) began construction on a 27-room lodge the following year. In 1941, the area became a part of the Ozark National Forest, changing from the Ouachita National Forest designation received in 1938. The WPA and Civil Conservation Corps (CCC) also constructed a road to the mountain (which would become the Mount Magazine Scenic Byway), trails, two dams which created Cove Lake and Spring Lake, and an amphitheatre. In 1971, the Mount Magazine Lodge burned and was a total loss. After the lodge burned, tourism declined until new plans for a state park atop Mount Magazine came in the 1980s. The Arkansas Act 884 of 1983 allowed Arkansas State Parks to begin the process of a state park on Arkansas's highest point, and a partnership with the USDA Forest Service allowed the park to open in 1998 as Mount Magazine State Park. Recreation The park offers a visitors center with interactive exhibits and gift shop shortly after entering the park. Campers can choose from two class AAA campsites and 16 class AA tent-only campsites at Cameron Bluff Campground. Groups can rent the Greenfield Picnic Area, which is a large pavilion, or utilize the grills and tables at the Benefield, Brown Springs, or Cameron Bluff picnic areas for free. Hiking and horseback riding trails meander throughout the wooded areas of the park. Cycling is allowed throughout the park, and all paved routes feature bike lanes. Bike trails include the Huckleberry Mountain Horse Trail and the Will Apple's Road Trail. Blue Mountain Lake, Cove Lake, and Spring Lake all offer bream, catfish and largemouth bass in addition to free swimming. Cedar Piney Lake is also available for fishing but not swimming. There also exist many opportunities for ATV riding, backpacking, hang gliding, mountain biking, rappelling, and rock climbing within the park. The park hosts the annual Mount Magazine International Butterfly Festival, and is a haven for many rare species of butterflies in Arkansas due to the special blend of altitude and temperature available. The state butterfly, the Diana fritillary, is found almost exclusively in the Arkansas River Valley and the Petit Jean River Valley. The mountain is also home to black bear, whitetail deer, bobcat, and coyote as well as other species. The Lodge at Mount Magazine In 2006, the multimillion-dollar Lodge at Mount Magazine and 13 cliffside cabins were opened. The rustic-style lodge offers 60 guest rooms, a grand lobby, a conference center, a business center, an indoor swimming pool, a fitness center, a gift shop, and panoramic views from every guest room. The Skycrest Restaurant offers traditional Southern cuisine, a two-story fireplace, and a view of the Petit Jean River Valley and distant Blue Mountain Lake.

Bowker (from 5 May; sick 21 July 1917) * Brigadier-General C.E. Heathcote (from 2 September 1917) Palestine Shortly after joining 74th Division, the brigade took part in the Second Battle of Gaza (17‚Äì19 April 1917). Then in the autumn it fought in the Third Battle of Gaza (27 October ‚Äì 7 November) including the Battle of Beersheba (31 October) and the capture of the Sheria Position (6 November). Shortly afterwards it was involved in the Capture of Jerusalem (8‚Äì9 December) and its subsequent defence (27‚Äì30 December). In March 1918, the brigade was in the Battle of Tel 'Asur, but shortly afterwards was warned that it was to move to France, where reinforcements were urgently required to stem the German Spring Offensive. Before departure for France, the 210th Machine Gun Company joined 4th (of 229th Brigade), 209th (of 230th Brigade) and 261st Machine Gun companies to form 74th Battalion, Machine Gun Corps. It concentrated at Alexandria between 17 and 30 April and departed for France with the division on the latter date. Western Front The 74th Division embarked at Alexandria for Marseille on 29‚Äì30 April 1918, and was concentrated in the Abbeville district by 18 May. Here the dismounted Yeomanry underwent training for service on the Western Front, including gas defence. Infantry brigades on the Western Front had been reduced to three battalions, and 231st Brigade lost the 24th Royal Welsh Fusiliers, which went to form part of the 94th (Yeomanry) Brigade in the reconstituted 31st Division. On 14 July 1918 the Yeomanry Division went into the line for the first time. During the Allies' victorious Hundred Days Offensive it fought in the Second Battle of Bapaume (2‚Äì3 September) and the Battle of √âpehy (18 September), and took part in the succession of small fights during the final advance. On 18 October, while advancing towards Lille, 231st Brigade 'found the machine-gun defenders of Sainghin assisted by a field battery, and they resisted stoutly; although the village was cleared during the morning, it was dusk before the Germans were driven out of the wood beyond and across the la Marque, and all the bridges being destroyed they could not be followed'.Edmonds, p. 413. During the night of 8/9 November, patrols from 231st Brigade probed the German defences of Tournai and worked their way down to the River Scheldt. The Germans had withdrawn to the east bank, and 231st Brigade seized the northern bridge but could get no further against machine-gun fire from the far bank, and all the other bridges in the town had been blown up. At 07.00 on 9 November, 10th King's Shropshire Light Infantry crossed by a footbridge laid by the engineers at the northern end of the town, and the rest of the brigade followed through this bridgehead.Edmonds, pp. 541‚Äì3. When the Armistice with Germany came into effect on 11 November, the division was across the River Dendre at Ath.Edmonds, p. 555. After the fighting ended, the troops of 74th Division were engaged in railway repair while demobilisation began. The division and its subformations were disbanded on 10 July 1919. Second World War A new 231st Infantry Brigade was created in the Second World War on 1 April 1943 by the redesignation of the 1st (Malta) Infantry Brigade. This was composed of three Regular Army battalions that had been stationed on or been transported to Malta since the start of the Second World War and had served there during the siege. After Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel's defeat at the Second Battle of El Alamein, in late 1942, Malta lost some of its strategic significance and the 231st Independent Infantry Brigade, joined the British Eighth Army in North Africa, who were preparing for the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky).Joslen, pp. 392‚Äì3. Sicily and Italy The Allied invasion of Sicily was to be the first of three amphibious assault landings conducted by the 231st Brigade during the war. The brigade was constituted as an independent brigade group under the command of Brigadier Roy Urquhart, later famous as commander of the 1st Airborne Division, which was destroyed at Arnhem in September 1944. After some hard fighting, including the 2nd Devons at Regalbuto amongst the foothills of Mount Etna, the Germans were driven from Sicily and the Allies prepared to invade Italy. Despite the success of the relatively brief campaign, the brigade sustained almost 600 casualties, with the 1st Hampshires losing over 300 men, the 1st Dorsets 189 and the 2nd Devons 113. The campaign ended in mid-August and the 231st Brigade was withdrawn for a short rest to prepare for the next operation. Troops of the 231st Brigade resting beside a bulldozer after fighting a fire on a landing craft which was hit during a surprise landing in the enemy's rear at Porro Di S. Venere, Italy, 8 September 1943. The 231st Brigade's second assault landing was at Porto San Venere on 7 September 1943, when the Allies invaded Italy. They were now experienced amphibious assault troops. After this, the 231st Brigade became an integral part of the veteran 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division and was recalled to England with the division, to prepare for the Allied invasion of Normandy, scheduled for the spring of 1944. In February 1944 Brigadier Sir A. B. G. Stanier assumed command of the brigade. Gold Beach Gold Beach was the codename for the centre invasion beach during the Allied invasion of Normandy, 6 June 1944 or D-Day. It lay between Omaha Beach and Juno Beach, was 8 km wide and divided into four sectors. From west to east they were How, Item, Jig, and King. This was the hardest and costliest of the 231st Brigade's three assault landings and the Battle of Normandy exacted a heavy toll on the brigade. The task of invading Gold Beach was given to the 50th Infantry Division and the 8th Armoured Brigade. The beach was assaulted in multiple brigades of the 50th Infantry Division; on the West was the 231st Infantry Brigade, followed by the 56th Brigade, attached to this was a regiment of DD tanks from Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry, the infantry assault battalions that attacked in the west were; the 1st Battalion, Hampshire Regiment, and the 1st Battalion, Dorsetshire Regiment. On the east the 69th Brigade, followed by 151st Brigade, again a regiment of DD tanks was attached, they were from the 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards. Universal Carriers of 50th Division wade ashore from LCTs on Jig beach, Gold area, 6 June 1944. The markings on the carrier indicate a vehicle from the 1st Battalion, Dorsetshire Regiment, 231st Brigade. Their primary objective was to seize the town of Bayeux, the Caen-Bayeux road, and the port of Arromanches with the secondary objectives being to make contact with the Americans landing at Omaha Beach to the West and the Canadians landing at Juno Beach to the East. The 716th Static Infantry Division commanded by Generalleutnant Wilhelm Richter, and elements of the 352nd Infantry Division commanded by Generalleutnant Dietrich Kraiss, defended the Channel coast for the Germans. H-Hour for the Gold beach landing was set for 0725 hours. At 0725 hours, the 50th Infantry Division assault landed Gold beach with the objective of taking the beach, then moving to Bayeux and making a rendezvous with the American troops at Omaha Beach. The landing crafts were deployed seven miles off the beach, compared to the American ones that were deployed 12 miles off the beaches, this meant they had a shorter run in. Two of the bunkers of Longues-sur-Mer. The first battalion to come ashore suffered heavy casualties, among them their CO and the second-in-command, because their higgins boats grounded earlier than expected and they had to wade ashore. By midnight on the 6 June 1944, 24,970 men had landed on Gold Beach, and had penetrated six miles into occupied France. They fulfilled one of their secondary objectives by meeting up with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division who had landed at Juno Beach, but failed in their primary objective of reaching the Caen-Bayeux road and in their secondary objective of meeting the Americans from Omaha Beach. However they had established a foothold into Fortress Europa that would ultimately be a stepping stone to victory. The Longues-sur-Mer gun battery (as seen in the film The Longest Day where the German officer looks out at the invasion fleet), surrendered on 7 June to the 231st Brigade. North West Europe Infantrymen of the 1st Battalion, Hampshire Regiment crossing the Seine at Vernon, 28 August 1944. After Normandy the brigade followed the armoured divisions across northern France to Belgium, where they assisted the Guards Armoured Division, in liberating Brussels, and on the Dutch border. They held Joe's Bridge in Lommel across the Escaut Canal at the start of XXX Corps, advance to Arnhem during Operation Market Garden and was then present during the Nederrijn campaign in North West Europe. Much depleted, the 231st Brigade was transferred back to the United Kingdom in December 1944, to serve as a Training Brigade. At the same time, it exchanged the 2nd Battalion Devonshire Regiment, for the 1/6th Battalion, Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) from the 131st (Queens) Brigade.

Description Specimens of Tempskya could grow to be up to 14.75 feet (4.5 meters) tall. Its trunk was actually a large collection of stems surrounded by adventitious roots. The false trunk could be up to 50 cm in diameter. Thin leaves have been discovered for the first time on T. wyomingense specimens; the more commonly seen fossilized leaf bases show that they covered the upper part of the trunk. Hypothesized growth pattern Examination of cross sections of various Tempskya specimens shows that those with the largest trunks have the smallest number of stems, and vice versa. From this, a possible growth pattern of Tempskya has been suggested: at the sporeling stage, Tempskya would consist of a single stem, which would begin to branch off distally. A \\"mantle\\" of adventitious roots would then develop around the stems to support them. Later on, many of the stems would begin to decay, while the adventitious roots would still provide support and absorb water for the grown plant. This growth pattern has also been hypothesized for Psaronius. Taxonomy Tempskya sp. - Reconstruction at MUSE - Science Museum in Trento Tempskya was originally described in 1824 as Endogenites erosa before being described as Tempskya by August Carl Joseph Corda in 1845. The four species originally described by Corda were, in order: T. pulchra, T. macrocaula, T. microrrhiza, and T. schimperi. Tempskya is the sole member of the family Tempskyaceae. The family has been placed in the order \\"Filicales\\", which is now split into a number of orders of leptosporangiate ferns. Fossil sites Tempskya finds were thought to be exclusive to the Northern Hemisphere until specimens were discovered in Argentina and Australia (in 2003 and 2005, respectively). Tempskya fossils have also been discovered in the Czech Republic (2002) and Japan (1986). Tempskya were frequently found fluvial deposited in gravel pits in Germany. Its origin is not clear, in part they came certainly from Czech sites.

These conditions can lead to language-based disabilities, motor planning deficits, reading dysfunction, and attention and behavioral disorders. The Focus Foundation believes that, through increased awareness, early identification, and specific and targeted treatment, children with these conditions can reach their full potential. The Focus Foundation leads in the research of X and Y Chromosomal Variations with 25% of all publications on the disorders. The foundation also leads the research field in testosterone treatment for the testosterone deficiency associated with extra X chromosomes. The Focus Foundation was established in 2005 by Carole Samango-Sprouse. Dr. Samango- Sprouse is also the director of the Neurodevelopmental Diagnostic Center for Young Children, located near Annapolis, Maryland, and an associate clinical professor of pediatrics at The George Washington University in Washington, D.C. and an adjunct associate professor in the Department of Human and Molecular Genetics at Florida International University. She serves as the Executive Director and Chief Science Officer of The Focus Foundation and has experience with the three disorders that are the Foundation's focus: X & Y chromosomal variations, developmental dyspraxia and dyslexia. The Focus Foundation attempts to increase awareness an X and Y chromosomal variations in order to help children with these disorders. Although all physicians, ancillary health care providers and special educators are taught that genetic abnormalities can impact a child's development, practitioners often receive insufficient information about these disorders, and, therefore, do not often test for X & Y chromosomal variations when a child presents with neurodevelopmental concerns. By promoting awareness of these disorders and associated symptoms, The Focus Foundation hopes to increase early identification, implement interventions, and help families pursue optimal outcomes for their children. Diagnosis of X & Y variations X & Y variations are common but frequently undiagnosed genetic conditions that differ from the normal sex chromosome pairings of XX for females and XY for males. Errors in recombination during meiosis produce additional X or Y chromosomes when compared to the typical complement of 46,XX or 46,XY. The resulting chromosomes (47 or more) may impact a child‚Äôs neurodevelopment and cognition. Twenty-one babies born each day have an X & Y chromosomal variation, and only five will be diagnosed in their lifetime. In addition, twenty percent of school-aged children illustrate signs of learning dysfunction. Given the frequency of X & Y chromosomal variations in the general population, children who present with learning disorders of an unknown etiology should receive genetic testing to rule out these common disorders. Only 5% of children with dyslexia are ever identified in their lifetime although they have symptoms presenting by 6 years of age, while most children with developmental dyspraxia are misdiagnosed with other disorders such as just speech delay, behavior problems, or ADHD. The Focus Foundation works with healthcare providers, specialists, and parents to properly diagnosis, research, and organize a specific and targeted treatment for children with X & Y chromosomal variations. With the proper diagnosis and intervention, children who have these neurogenetic disorders are transformed from vulnerable to powerful and become more confident, able, and successful than they have ever been. The Focus Foundation aims to inform professionals and families throughout the country, as well as around the world about these disorders. The organization has hosted international clinics in the United Kingdom, Italy, and, more recently, Australia. These conferences invite families and physicians for consultations and speeches from a multi-disciplinary team of experts specializing in these disorders. By promoting the spread of accurate and novel information about the incidence, diagnosis, symptoms, and management of these disorders, The Focus Foundation aims to encourage recovery worldwide. With help, all of these children can reach their full potential. The Focus Foundation consists of scientists, scholars, educators, health care providers, fundraising and marketing experts, and volunteers that work together on these issues and help change these children's lives. The team conducts and presents research projects in order to further expand our understanding of these disorders. The Focus Foundation attends international and domestic meetings in order to foster partnerships in order to research, educate and train medical professionals and the community about developmental disturbances, brain-based intervention, and syndrome-specific treatment.  Conditions Researched  The Focus Foundation researches and helps families with children who have X and Y chromosomal variations, dyslexia, and/or dyspraxia. The X and Y Chromosomal Variations studied by The Focus Foundation include: ¬∑ 45,X (Turner syndrome): ¬∑ 47,XXX (Triple X syndrome; Trisomy X) ¬∑ 47,XXY (Klinefelter syndrome) ¬∑ 47,XYY (Jacob syndrome) ¬∑ 48,XXXY ¬∑ 48,XXYY ¬∑ 48,XXXX ¬∑ 49,XXXXY  Assistance provided  The Focus Foundation works with families, healthcare providers and educators.  Families  The Focus Foundation helps families identify and understand specific reasons for their child‚Äôs difficulties in school, behavioral problems, or developmental delays. In addition, through their research, the team identifies the treatment and management strategies that effectively allow children with X & Y chromosome variations and other rare disorders to reach their optimal outcome.These personalized recommendations are based one years of expertise and impact on health and well being as well as home, school and community life.  Health care practitioners  Most health care practitioners are not familiar with chromosome variations and, therefore, rarely consider X & Y chromosomal variations as a possible explanation for developmental concerns. The Focus Foundation works to inform practitioners of common signs that might indicate that a child has a chromosome variation, as well as provide resources and partnerships with which to offer genetic testing for these disorders. With the introduction of more accurate and affordable testing, X & Y chromosome variations are beginning to be more widely known in the medical community.  Educators  The Focus Foundation informs these professionals on how to work with and optimize the outcome in spite of developmental concerns or special needs: from providing teachers with resources and strategies to determining what kinds of outside services each child may need. With the development and administration of appropriate therapeutic intervention, every child has the opportunity to achieve their goals.  Conferences  The Focus Foundation hosts several conferences annually for different groups; these conferences include expert speakers that specialize in Neurodevelopment, Pediatric Genetics and Neurology, Endocrinology, Orthopedics, Immunology, Physical Therapy, Speech and Language, and Occupational Therapy.  The Atypical Learner Conference  First held in 2011, The Atypical Learner Conference is designed for parents and caregivers of bright children who might be struggling to succeed in school. This conference focuses on understanding common causes, explanations, and treatments for dyslexia, ADHD, speech delay, school failure, and behavioral difficulties.  Annual Conference for Children with 49,XXXXY  Now in its sixteenth year, this is the largest gathering of this rare disorder in the world, with attendees traveling from across the United States and the globe. The Maryland conference features patient evaluations by a multidisciplinary team of physicians who specialize in rare chromosomal variations and have established themselves as experts in their fields. These and other experts present pertinent and educational information about 49,XXXXY to parents in order to better equip families to pursue optimal outcomes for their child.  Annual Conference for Children with 48,XXXY  Similar to the conference for children with 49,XXXXY, this conference focuses on children with 48,XXXY, their families and healthcare providers.  Research  The Focus Foundation engages in research of the general biological causes and potential treatments of aspects of the phenotype of X and Y Chromosomal Variations. Research includes the impact of each additive X, the potential benefit of testosterone replacement therapy at different integral junctures, and the regional brain differences within each disorder and treatment group.

The Siberian fur trade expanded from localized trade, and Siberian fur is now traded around the world. The Siberian fur trade had a significant impact on the development of Siberia through exploration and colonization. The fur trade also precipitated a decline in the number of fur-bearing animals and resulted in Siberia being conquered by Russia. Beginnings Fur market in Irbit Traditionally, Siberians hunted as a means of sustenance and only used the fur from animals they hunted and consumed for gloves and hats. The practice of hunting animals solely for fur began after the Russians came to Siberia. Sable quickly became the most valuable and popular type of Siberian fur, and still maintains the distinction to this day. The Siberian fur trade began in the sixteenth century, peaked in the seventeenth century, and continues to the present day.Fur Trade: Russia. Answers.com While sable has always been the most coveted fur from Siberia, the Siberian fur trade has included a large variety of animals pelts used for a variety of products, most frequently clothing. Some of the richest fur regions in Siberia are the Yakutsk, Kamchatka, and Okhotsk Peninsulas. The Stroganov family, wealthy merchant-capitalists with extensive resources and influence in Russia, played a significant role in developing Siberia's fur trade. The Stroganovs owned several pieces of land in Siberia and made large profits trading with the natives for fur on these lands. The Stroganov family lead the way to fur trading in Siberia, which became both economically and culturally important to both Russia and Siberia. Obtaining furs Siberian fur trader at the fair in Leipzig, Germany (c. 1800) Russians implemented several methods of acquiring the fur pelts from the Siberian furriers: yasak, purchase, confiscation, hunting expeditions, trade with natives, and in much later years, farming of the most valued fur-bearing animals. Yasak was the easiest way of collecting furs, as the furs were simply demanded as a tribute or tax from the Siberian natives. Russian explorers and hunters were not as skilled as the Siberian natives at hunting fur-bearing animals without damaging the fur, which made trading with the Siberians the second easiest way to obtain pelts. The Siberian natives knew how to kill the animals without ruining the fur. Yasak (fur tribute) This chart shows the annual yasak collections during the seventeenth century, divided by the native peoples of Siberia. Yasak, otherwise known as Iasak, refers to the fur tax that the natives of Siberia were forced to pay to the tsarist government of Russia. Russians would set up winter camps known as zimovya while they waited for the Siberians to hunt and pay their taxes in fur. In return, the Siberians were promised to be able to look to the Russian government for protection. If a native tribe, community, or individual did not comply to the tax or otherwise resisted, they would face government-backed Cossack raids. Yasak could be levied on an individual, a tribe, or both. All men between the ages of eighteen and fifty years were subject to this tax. The type of fur and the amount of fur pelts required for this tax varied, depending on how available the pelts were. For example, in the beginning of the 17th century, yasak could be anywhere from five to twenty-two sables per man, but this dropped to three sable pelts by the mid-1600s due to decreases in the sable population. In 1601, Russian tax collectors in the Verkhoturye district collected about ten sables a year from every married man and five sables a year from every bachelor. Officials collecting the yasak tribute also demanded extra furs as \\"gifts\\". Fox, squirrel, and ermine pelts were also accepted as yasuk after sable populations began to decline due to overhunting. Instead of one sable pelt, the following was accepted as its equivalent: one fox, glutton (relative of the marten), or otter pelt; two blue-fox pelts; sixteen polar-fox pelts; or one hundred squirrel pelts. The Russian government decided the amount of other pelts that were equivalent to the sable pelt. Within forty years, almost all Siberian natives were forced into paying fur tribute to the Russians. Russian traders, hunters, and explorers reached the Pacific coastline by 1650 and were collecting fur tribute from most natives along the coast. Hunting and trading with natives Beyond the yasuk, the Russians had two principal ways of obtaining Siberian furs: through hunting the animals themselves or through trading. Promyshlenniki was the Russian name for the small groups of Russian traders and trappers who took part in the Siberian fur trade. They were free-men who used fur trapping as a way of making a living. They worked together as a group making traps, collecting food and drink, and building camps in the harsh climate. These groups would evenly split the fur caught between all the members of the group. Working in groups gave these trappers protection against harsh Siberian winters, against unexpected attacks, and other dangers they could encounter if they were alone. At the peak of the Siberia fur trade during the seventeenth century, over a thousand of these trappers and traders ventured into Siberia each year. Men were infected with \\"fur fever,\\" wanting to strike it rich like the Stroganovs. Plate of squirrel fur backs Squirrel fur bellies The Siberian fur trade was composed of two main types of traders. Small groups of traders braved the dangers of Siberia's taiga wilderness to trade with natives themselves, but many more traders stayed in Russia and sent agents to work for them in Siberia. Both the independent traders and the agents of the traders in Russia would stay in Siberia typically anywhere from two to six years, depending on how far they wanted to travel, their luck at trading with natives and trapping the animals, and the harshness of the weather. The most commonly traded items included Russian-made goods such as metal wares and ironworks, hunting equipment and firearms, and food and drink supplies. For most of the natives, the hunting equipment and metal products were the most useful and coveted trade items. There was no oversight or rules for the traders who participated in the Siberian fur trade, especially in the first few centuries of fur trading. The native Siberians did not have much knowledge of the worth of their furs, and Russian traders commonly took advantage of this ignorance. For example, names would commonly pay for one copper kettle with the amount of sable pelts that would fit inside of the pot, a tiny fraction of the pelts' actual worth. Traders frequently used force and terror tactics to collect additional furs from the natives. For example, one report from Okhotosk told of a trader who kidnapped all the children from the local native Tungus so he could sell them back to their parents for a sable pelt apiece. In some cases, the traders would hold the native women and children as hostages and in doing so they would force the fathers, brothers, and husbands to bring them furs in return for their loved ones‚Äô safety. The fur hunting expeditions into Siberia were mostly conducted in groups ranging from six to sixty men based at small winter peasant huts in the Siberian taiga. The groups baited pit traps with fish or meat to catch sable, and tracked other prey with nets and dogs. They would usually spend up to six or seven weeks at a time hunting. While hunting on land, they would usually use a dog team trained to smell and hunt animals, particularly sable. The dogs were trained not to kill the animals; hunters feared that the dogs would destroy the precious fur by tearing it to pieces. The hunters also occasionally used dogs to retrieve animals once they were killed. Hunters typically killed the animals themselves, doing their best not to damage the pelts in the process. Hunters utilized bows, traps, snares, and nets to catch and kill animals for their pelts. Hunters would also follow the footprints of the animals to their dwellings and catch the animals as they emerged. Water mammals, such as sea otters, were also hunted for their pelts. Hunters would balance on small kayaks and would throw spears to kill the water animals. This skill was commonly passed down from father to son and taught at a young age. Few Russian hunters were as skilled at the Siberian natives at killing animals without damage to the pelts, which made trading the superior method of acquiring these pelts. Hunting was also dangerous for the participants - hunters faced the possibility of disease, accidents, injury from animals, or violent confrontations with the indigenous peoples of Siberia when hunting fur-bearing animals. Under the best conditions, the hunting and trading parties exploring Siberia had a mere seven months after the spring thaw before the Siberian winter drove the animals into winter shelters, which stopped hunting for the season. Early routes taken by fur traders followed the large rivers in Siberia, as the furs were easier to transport over water than land. These rivers connected the major fur gathering centers and provided for relatively quick transport between them. The fur pelts were tied between two boards for transport along these rivers, and were thus called \\"timbers\\". By the twentieth century, prime fur-bearing animals were raised on farms. However, the most valuable pelts still come from the wilderness, because the farm-raised animals were believed to not have as luxurious pelts. The wild animal furs are the most valuable because the harsh climates forced the animals to naturally grow thick warm fur, whereas the ones grown in farms do not need to grow such thick fur for protection from the harsh climate. Sable kopeck stamp Sables were the first fur-bearing animals in Siberia to interest Russians. Sables were known as the \\"Golden Fleece\\" because they of their extreme value, both on the local and the world markets. A fur clothing store describes the sable fur as follows: \\"It is difficult to describe Russian sable fur in words: almost weightless, silky, satin like, lustrous, sparkling, glistening, incredibly beautiful. In addition it is very warm and durable.\\"\\"Sable Coat is King.\\" The Haute Women's Fur Clothing Boutique. 14 May 2009. Web. 16 January 2012. < http://www.luxfurclothing.com/blog/?cat=11> Sable continues to be the world's most valuable fur. The most sought-after sable furs in the world come from the Barguzin region of Siberia. The sable is a small mammal resembling a mix between a weasel and a cat. It feeds on pine nuts, mice, and squirrels and hunts mostly at night. The sable fur surpasses all other types of fur due to its silky dense texture and luminous shades of beige, brown, gold, silver, and black. The darkest shades of sable fur are the most valuable. Next to sable, Siberian fox furs and squirrel pelts are the most valued furs from the region. Bargusinski fur skins (best sort), tanned Raw Bargusinski skins In addition to sable, black and white fox, ermine, beaver, squirrel, lynx, wolf, wolverine, rabbit, marten, walrus, sea otter, and polar bear were also hunted for their pelts. Most of these fur bearing animals are found in the Siberian taiga, except for the sea otters and walrus that were found on the North Pacific coasts. In more recent times, fur farming has been used to breed animals for their fur. Silver fox farms were started in 1936, mostly in Yakutia. These farms eliminated some of the dangers and uncertainties involved with hunting in the wilderness. This trade of valuable fur-bearing animals from Siberia has a definite impact on the world fur trading industry. In 1910, the pelts of seventy thousand sables, ten times that many ermine, five million rabbits, and fifteen million squirrels from Siberia accounted for almost half the world's furs. Today, the most valuable furs still come from Siberia. Profits Coat of Russian sables The monetary profits from the Siberian fur trade were enormous; Siberian furs were known as \\"soft gold\\" because their value is comparable to actual gold. Altogether, the Siberian fur industry was worth around $62 million a year in 1992. In the 16th century, a prime sable pelt sold for ten times what a peasant family could earn in a year, and a black fox fetched up to ten times the price of sable. Private traders sold roughly 350,000 rubles' worth of Siberian furs annually during the seventeenth century. In comparison, a peasant family of four earned less than one ruble a year from forty acres of good farmland. A few good fox pelts in 1623 could buy fifty acres of land, a decent cabin, five horses, ten head of cattle, twenty sheep, and still have capital left over. In the 1990s, white ermine pelts were worth 16 rubles, squirrel pelts were worth 5 rubles, and sable pelts were worth 150 rubles. These furs have even historically been used as currency, and fur-lined cloaks and hats were a signature of Russian royalty. At the peak of the fur trade in the middle of the seventeenth century, Siberian furs accounted for more than ten percent of Russia's total revenue. The government of Russia set the price for furs in Siberia, and kept the price of furs artificially low in order to make a larger profit on furs sold abroad. All local furs were sold to the state fur company in Irkutsk or Tobolsk, two of the largest fur trading centers in Siberia. A first-grade fox pelt was sold the state trading center in Irkutsk for 108 rubles ‚Äì approximately $18 in 1990. That same fur was then sold in Anchorage, Alaska for over $150, or about 4,779 rubles. Today, fur clothing is still a sign of wealth around the world, and the prices for prime fur clothing continue to rise. The sable coat, in particular, is a symbol of status and is one of the most coveted types of fur coats. There are American and Canadian versions of the sable coat, but the Russian version is the most valuable. Prices for the full-length Siberian sable fur coat today can cost around $100,000 or 3,185,850 rubles. They are sold in many major cities around the world like Paris, Milan, and New York. Trading partners Fur market in Nizhny Novgorod Fur traders in Nizhny Novgorod Siberian fur quickly became very popular around the world very soon after the Siberian fur trade began in the sixteenth century. Most of the Siberian fur trade in the first few centuries was controlled by Russian explorers and traders. Trade connections also existed between Siberia and other European and Asian territories. There was a great demand for fur in Byzantium and Western Europe. Furs were also traded to China and Persia. In exchange, Siberian fur traders obtained silks and other luxury goods from those places. These goods were not common to Siberia, and thus were in high demand. Siberian furs sold to China were a huge source of revenue during the eighteenth century, as furs sold in China for up to ten times more than they would locally. Chinese buyers purchased more than seven million Siberian fur pelts a year. The Chinese preferred squirrel furs for its warmth, durability, and relative inexpensiveness. These furs became very popular in the Chinese winter clothing lines. Trade connections were also made between Siberia and Bukhara, Khiva, and other significant trade centers in the Islamic regions of Central Asia. Bukharan merchants frequently came to Siberian towns in search of furs. As the Russians traveled across the Pacific, North Americans were brought into the fur trade. Siberian furs were brought to Alaska and traded there. Indirectly, this allowed Siberia to also become connected with the Western Hemisphere and the Americas. In the present world, Siberian furs are still extremely popular in international fur trade. Furs from the northern Siberian tundra are frequently found in international fur auctions around the world and carry high prices at auction. The Siberian fur trade has major trade connections in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Trappers still hunt for fur and the sable is still the most important of fur bearing animals. Many Siberian indigenous peoples are totally dependent on trapping as a living¬∞ Willerslev 2015. Benefits The fur trade was socially, economically, and also physically beneficial to Siberia. The fur traders brought new people to Siberia in search of furs, and these trappers, traders and explorers would connect with the natives. For example, Russian men brought to Siberia for the fur trade would often meet and marry native women there. Men who settled in Siberia helped the Siberian population grow and diversify, as these men would bring their Russian culture and skills to Siberia. Siberians also benefited by their furs being the most coveted furs in the world. As the Siberian fur became popular, Siberia began to be considered more of an area filled with valuable natural resources, rather than a desolate area of nothingness. Finally, the fur trade brought in products that are not common in Siberia. Such as weapons, metal workings, and exotic silks and spices. The Siberian fur trade encouraged exploration and colonization of the Siberian landmass. Hunters would travel across the tundras, taigas, and forests in search of animals, where they built camps and forts. This exploration and camp building began the development and modernization of Siberia. Russians expanded into Siberia rapidly, driven by the promise of fast fortunes through the fur trade. Hunters and trappers and traders flocked into Siberia in a \\"Fur Rush\\" similar to the Gold Rush of California and Alaska in the United States. The urbanization of several major Siberian cities can be directly traced to the revenues and profits of the Siberian fur trade. The cities of Tobolsk, Tomsk, and Irkutsk became Siberia's leading urban centers, due primarily to revenue brought in by the fur trade. Siberian fur also became a large part of Russian culture. For example, Soviet Olympic teams wore furs at the Olympic games as part of their uniforms. Consequences The Siberian fur trade was not completely advantageous and had several direct negative consequences for Siberia. By the beginning of the 18th century, there was a sharp decline in the number of fur-bearing animals across Siberia as trappers and traders collected furs without any thought for population control. Hunters would hunt in an area until the animal population was decimated and then move on to another hunting ground. In 1913 a ban was put on sable hunting in order to keep this animal from extinction. Many animals have been killed for the Siberian fur trade, which has had severe negative effects on Siberian ecology. In the middle of the nineteenth century, about 10-15 million squirrels were killed in Siberia each year, in addition to tens of thousands of ermines, rabbits, martens, foxes, sables, lynx and wolverine. Most of these animals are small and a single jacket requires many pelts. For example, several hundred squirrel pelts are needed to make one fur cloak. In Irkutsk, a major fur trade center, more than 150,000 sable pelts, thousands of Arctic foxes, and hundreds of thousands of squirrels passed through its customs house each year. Hunters also came to Siberia with the false image of Siberia as an endless wilderness that could not be exhausted, and they hunted and killed without regard to maintaining the animal populations. Fur products Siberian furs have been used to make a wide range of products, with fur clothing being the most common. Clothing made from Siberian fur includes different length coats, hats, gloves, shawls, and boots. The most popular fur item sold throughout the world is the fur coat. The Siberian fur coats range in length from mid-length to full length, falling either to the knees or to the floor. Fur coats can be made of almost any type of fur, but the most valued are the furs that are soft and will flow gently around the body. For example, reindeer fur is not usually used for coats because it tends to get stiff and rigid in the cold. The Siberian sable coats are the most expensive fur clothing. They come in seven different shades depending on which region of Siberia the fur is taken from and what season the sables were hunted. The high head fur of the sable has the darkest color, a dark blue-ish black that is the most expensive type of sable fur. The normal head coloring has blackish brown to dark blue fur. Most sable fur is light chestnut blue at the roots and yellow sand at the ends. Barguzinskiy sable coats sell for around $80,000 (about 2,550,280 rubles). The Siberian squirrel coats are also extremely popular in modern world markets. The blue-grey pelts are considered to be the best type of squirrel fur. They are soft and light weight, but this type of fur is also fragile. Siberian squirrel coats are less expensive than sable coats, though prices depend on quality and color. Fitch and corsac furs are used for coats, and the best quality fitch fur comes from Siberia. The fitch, or European polecat, is a ferret-like animal, and the corsac is a type of fox that is also found in Siberia. However, these furs are less popular because foxes are common to virtually every fur-trading country in the world.\\"Siberian Chapka Ushanka.\\" Russian Fur Hat, Chapka. Artic-Store, LLC. 2011. Web. 16 January 2012. The Siberian ushanka is a full fur hat, consisting entirely of warm fur. It is commonly made out of black foxes, red foxes, silver foxes, shadow foxes, blue foxes, brown foxes, raccoons, martens, or black beavers. It covers the top of the head and comes down to also cover the ears and back of the head. This is the most warm fur hat available in the world market. The prices depend on the type and quality of fur, but can cost up to $650.00 (about 20,721 rubles).\\"Siberian Chapka Ushanka.\\" Russian Fur Hat, Chapka. Arctic-Store, LLC. 2011. Web. 16 January 2012. Fur boots are also in cold climates. Reindeer fur boots are popular in both Siberia and around the world. Like most of Siberia's fur products, these boots can be extremely expensive. These boots range from a starting cost of $330‚Äì$400 (about 10,00-12,00 rubles) to a maximum of about $630 (about 20,000 rubles). These are a reindeer fur version of the Russian valenki boot. Fur boots can also be made out of variety of different furs, but reindeer is the most popular because of its insulating properties. Other furs, such as sable, are considered too luxurious and beautiful to be wasted on footwear. Siberian fur gloves can also be made with a variety of different furs. The most common types of fur used for this product are fox fur, raccoon, coyote, and rabbit, chosen for their softness and warmth. The prices can range from $59.95 (about 1911 rubles) to $449.95 (14,344 rubles) depending on the product and amount of fur included.\\"Womens Winter Gloves & Mittens.\\" FurHatWorld.com 2012.

Gungunum had wrestled Ur from Isin‚Äôs control by his 10th year and it is possible this was the cause of Lipit-I≈°tar‚Äôs overthrow. Indeed Ur-Ninurta made a dedicatory gift to the temple of Ningal in Ur during the 9th year of Gungunum. However, Ur-Ninurta continued to mention Ur in his titles (\\"herdsman of Ur\\") as did his successors in Isin. Gungunum went on to expand his kingdom, perhaps taking Nippur late in his reign.

Structure  BAK1 belongs to a large group of plant proteins known as the Leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs). In the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana, BAK1 and 4 other closely related proteins form a sub-group within the LRR-RK family, known as the somatic embryogenesis receptor kinases (SERKs). All 5 SERKs are transmembrane proteins. They consist of an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane pass and an intracellular domain. The extracellular domain is composed of several leucine rich repeats, and the intracellular domain functions as a protein kinase. BAK1 is thought to interact with many other LRR-RKs and the signalling output of BAK1 is dependent on its binding partner  Roles in plant development   Brassinosteroid signalling  Diagram of BAK1 in complex with BRI1 during brassinosteroid signalling BAK1 was initially identified for its role in brassinosteroid signalling. Brassinosteroid is a major plant hormone that has many roles and is often associated with cell elongation. BAK1 binds to the brassinosteroid receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) and this then triggers a phosphorylation cascade that leads to a change in expression of multiple genes.  Defense signalling  BAK1 is also critical for plant immunity and plants the lack BAK1 show a much greater susceptibility to bacterial infections. Plants are able to perceive bacteria by recognizing specific molecular signatures or 'effectors'. One of these signatures is bacterial-derived flagellin. Plants perceive flagellin when it binds to the receptor FLS2. When flagellin is perceived by FLS2, this strongly promotes the interaction between FLS2 and BAK1 and this then leads to changes in gene expression that promote defense against bacteria. In addition to flagellin, plants are also able to perceive other bacterial effectors. One of these, EF- Tu is perceived by the EF-Tu receptor (EFR). Similar to FLS2, BAK1 is required for EFR function. The LRR-RK Erecta (ER) may also promote plant defense, in concert with BAK1.  Regulation of stomatal development  Along with its role in plant defense, the ER:BAK1 complex also repress the development of stomata in leaves. Mutations in BAK1 and ER lead in increase in the number of stomata.  Molecular basis for diverse functional roles  The diverse functional roles of BAK1 are brought about through its binding to a large number of receptors. However, many of the molecular components downstream of these receptor:BAK1 complexes are shared between these signalling pathways (for example, BR Signalling Kinase 1 (BSK1) is a positive regulator of both BRI1:BAK1 signalling and FLS2:BAK1 signalling). It is currently unclear how cells are able to distinguish between a BSK1 which has been activated by BRI1 or FLS2. One recent study has shown that BRI1 and FLS2 localize to different 'nano-domains' on the cell membrane and so it is possible that this spatial separation accounts for the very different signal outputs.

Background and fighting In 1468, the citizens of Li√®ge rose up against Burgundian domination for the third time in four years. As a reaction, Charles the Bold had led an army towards Li√®ge to deal once and for all with the rebellious city. He was accompanied by King Louis XI of France. When the siege became desperate for the Li√©geois, they decided to make a night attack with 600 men, led by Vincent de Bueren and Gosuin de Streel, over the Saint Walburga stairs against the sleeping Burgundians. Their aim was to kill the Duke and the King, so that the army would be left leaderless and retreat. The plan failed, and all 600, including Vincent de Bueren and Gosuin de Streel, were killed. The Saint Walburga stairs were later renamed the \\"Bueren stairs\\". The next day Li√®ge surrendered, and at the command of Charles the Bold, hundreds of Li√©geois were tied together and thrown into the Meuse river.

In subsequent mythology  War Memorial from Theux, dedicated to both the Belgian war dead of World War I and the 600 Franchimontois The story of the 600 Franchimontois has come to us through the chronicler Philippe de Commines, who was present in the Burgundian camp at the Siege of Li√®ge. It is difficult to know the true history behind the story of the 600 Franchimontois, because it has been used since 1831 by the newly independent Kingdom of Belgium as an example of self-sacrifice for the fatherland and of resistance against any invader, no matter how powerful he might be. The story of the 600 Franchimontois was told in every Belgian school. After the German invasion of Belgium in 1914, King Albert I of Belgium appealed to his soldiers to resist the powerful German war-machine using the phrase: \\"Flemings, remember the Battle of the Golden Spurs, Walloons, remember the 600 Franchimontois!\\". When the French Community of Belgium was created, the day of the battle, October 29 was considered as a French Community Holiday. All of this makes it very difficult to distinguish truth from fiction. Recent historians have established that the attack did not go over the Bueren stairs, but through the Saint Margaret gate. The number of 600 men is probably also greatly exaggerated and there are even doubts that the men came from Franchimont.

It encompasses the ruins of a paper mill (erected 1829), a clerk's house (built circa 1830), and the Ivy Mills Mansion House (built 1837). The mansion house is a 2 1/2-story, five bay wide, stuccoed masonry structure, which includes a saltbox wing and a wide verandah. The original paper mill was erected in 1729, and the original mansion house in 1744. Both of the original buildings were replaced in the early-19th century by the present buildings. This district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. History Wilcox Paper Mill sketch from Henry Ashmead's History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania, 1884 In 1726, Thomas Willcox along with Thomas Brown built a mill dam across the Chester Creek. In 1729 a paper mill was erected and the first paper was sold. The Ivy Mills is the second oldest paper mill built in America. Only the Rittenhouse mill in Philadelphia is older. The first output from Ivy Mills was pressboard and then printing paper. Thomas Willcox was a friend of Benjamin Franklin and was known to have made paper for him. Willcox received the first order for paper used in the production of colonial and continental currency. After 1775, the mill was devoted almost entirely to making government paper for the continental bills, loan certificates and bills of exchange. At the time of the American Revolution, the government depended entirely on Ivy Mills for paper for currency. The Ivy Mills supplied paper for the Continental and United States governments as well as many South American countries. Paper was produced at Ivy Mills until 1886. The mill gradually fell into ruins. Note: This includes A mission chapel was established at Ivy Mills in 1730, making it the oldest Roman Catholic parish in Pennsylvania. In 1837, St. Mary's Chapel was built as part of the new Ivy Mills Mansion. Eventually the size of the congregation was sufficient to warrant the construction of a new church in 1852 named St. Thomas the Apostle Church a mile away in what would become the borough of Chester Heights. This district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

He has performed and recorded solo, as well as being a founder member of a number of bands, including Loafer, Icons of Poundland, Leigh Delamere & the Gordanos and Julian Gaskell and his Ragged Trousered Philanthropists.  History  Loafer and Icons of Poundland Gaskell studied Popular Music at the University of Salford and for a time played in the band Indigo Jones, leaving shortly after the release of their first single. In the early 2000s he performed and recorded extensively with two Manchester-based punk bands, Loafer and Icons of Poundland, alongside Ben Emissah on drums, Kester Jones on keyboards and guitar, and Alex Timewell who played bass. Loafer released much of their material independently via their own label Lipstick Head Records, including the album Care in the Community which they toured around the country. Gaskell was a regular at Manchester venue Big Hands and Icons performed a residency there in 2003. Both acts featured prominent guitar work, as well as instrumental assistance (particularly on Hammond Organ and second guitar) from Kester Jones who has continued to contribute to Gaskell's recordings until the present day. During this period, he also worked as a producer for Tom Hingley and the Lovers, I Am Kloot, Fast Cars, Jackie-O, Moco, The Obsession, Loose Canon and Kirsty McGee Solo and with the Ragged Trousered Philanthropists After relocating to Cornwall, Gaskell recorded and released the 17-track set, Technology Will Make Us Better, through Top of the Hill recordings in 2005. The record received favourable reviews among a number of publications such as Manchester Music and 247 Magazine. In 2006 Thomas Sharpe (also of Zapoppin') began playing bass for Gaskell as one of his Ragged Trousered Philanthropists along with Kester Jones. The band (named after the novel by Robert Tressell) would later come to include Dan Pye on Guitar and Rory Pugh on drums as well as a number of other guest players. The band self- released two studio albums and a number of EPs and digital downloads between 2006 and 2009 receiving radio airplay from the BBC's Steve Lamacq, as well as positive reviews from fRoots and 247 Magazine. Theatre accompaniment and further solo work Post-Philanthropists, Gaskell has written and performed globally for Bash Street Theatre Company and Rogue Theatre. Gaskell joined Bash Street Theatre in 2009 when he composed and performed a silent movie piano soundtrack for the work 'The Lion Tamer', the recording of which was later released independently by Gaskell. Following his work on The Lion Tamer he toured with the company in 2010 playing accordion in productions. In April 2011, Salford's Lowry Theatre hosted The Rogue Theatre for a run of their cabaret work 'The Dancer and the Devil' which featured music composed by and performed throughout by Gaskell. In January 2012 he self-released (with distribution assistance from Metronome) a new solo album: Kind Words From Home. The return of the Ragged Trousered Philanthropists In 2014, Gaskell re-convened the Ragged Trousered Philanthropists with a modified lineup - Thomas Sharpe now on banjo, piano, mandolin and vocals, Nigel Parsons on bass and Matthew Collington on drums. They released a well-received album \\"Carvery of Blight\\" in 2016 and gigged around Cornwall (as full band or as Gaskell & Sharpe duo) around this time. They appeared at Glastonbury Festival in 2014, and even played at the Kensington Palace Christmas party. Leigh Delamere & the Gordanos Featuring the same lineup as the post-2014 Ragged Trousered Philanthropists, Leigh Delamere & the Gordanos have gigged around the UK since 2016 as \\"an upright-piano mangling barrelhouse banjo homage to the greats of rhythm‚Äôn‚Äôblues, garage rock, boogie woogie and ragtime in an old-timey skiffle party style\\". They appeared at the Great Estate, Boardmasters and Masked Ball festivals in Cornwall, and ran a 1930's speakeasy stage \\"The Blind Pig\\" at these.  Critical reception Gaskell‚Äôs songwriting has been described as \\"very smart, very droll\\" by critic Everett True, while musically his recordings have often been noted for the combinations of genres and influences on display with fRoots editor, Ian Anderson writing of the Ragged Trousered Philanthropists: \\"What‚Äôs there not to like about this great little quintet?

Located in the crossroads village of Thornton at the intersection of Glen Mills and Thornton Roads, the district includes 13 contributing buildings built between 1750 and 1855, some in the Federal style. Among its structures, most of which face Glen Mills Road, are the Yellow House, one commercial building, seven residences, a converted blacksmith shop, a converted barn, three stables or carriage houses, and two frame sheds. Some of the houses are . Note: This includes It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Yellow House Over the years, the Yellow House has served as tavern, post office, general store, grocery, textile factory, and hair salon. The Yellow House opened as an inn and tavern about 1750; the surrounding village was known by the same name until it changed to Thornton. The Yellow House was originally owned by George Pearce. Note: This includes One of the important clients of the Yellow House Inn was George Gray, owner of Gray's Ferry over the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia. As the American Revolution proceeded, Gray moved his family away from Philadelphia to avoid the impending British Army occupation. Yet Gray's family could hear cannons during the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, and fleeing Continental Army troops came down the road right in front of the Yellow House. Gray's wife treated wounded soldiers in the Yellow House and later a group of Virginia soldiers signed a note of appreciation for her efforts. In 1800, Thomas Charlton set up a hand loom in the Yellow House to make linen. Note: This includes John King established the Thornton Post Office in the Yellow House in 1829. One of the first in its county not located on a post road, the Thornton Post Office is thought to be the oldest U.S. post office still in its original building. Note: This includes In 1845, the Yellow House was purchased by William D. Pennell at a bankruptcy auction. Isaac Pyle House The Isaac Pyle House, a stone example of the Penn Plan, was built around 1777. Caleb Hoopes House The Caleb Hoopes House is a two- story, four-bay building built about 1790.

The work received much discussion, including both positive and mixed reviews. Sulloway has been credited with helping to place psychoanalysis in historical context by establishing the influence of 19th-century biological thinking on Freud and with improving upon previous biographies of Freud such as the psychoanalyst Ernest Jones's The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud (1953‚Äì1957). He was complimented for discussions of Freud's relationship to the naturalist Charles Darwin and the otolaryngologist Wilhelm Fliess. Summary Sulloway describes the work as \\"a comprehensive intellectual biography of Sigmund Freud\\" that \\"seeks to bring both Freud and the history of psychoanalysis within the professional boundaries of the history of science.\\" He contrasts his approach to Freud to that of Ernest Jones, author of The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud. He discusses such works of Freud as The Interpretation of Dreams (1899), Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (1905), and Totem and Taboo (1913). His discussion of Freud draws on the psychiatrist Henri Ellenberger's The Discovery of the Unconscious (1970). Sulloway also discusses the naturalists Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Charles Darwin, the psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing, the physician Josef Breuer, the otolaryngologist Wilhelm Fliess, the physician Havelock Ellis, the sexologist Friedrich Salomon Krauss, and the psychiatrists Albert Moll and Iwan Bloch. Publication history Freud, Biologist of the Mind was first published in 1979 by Burnett Books. Reception Reviews Freud, Biologist of the Mind received positive reviews from Mark F. Schwartz in the Archives of Sexual Behavior and Erwin J. Haeberle in the Journal of Sex Research, mixed reviews from the philosopher Richard Wollheim in The New York Review of Books, Robert N. Mollinger in Library Journal, Richard L. Schoenwald in The American Historical Review, Jerome L. Himmelstein in Theory & Society, and a negative review from the psychologist Reuben Fine in the Journal of Psychohistory. The book was also reviewed by Eli Zaretsky in The Psychohistory Review, Perry Meisel in Partisan Review, Paul Weindling in The British Journal for the History of Science, J. O. Wisdom in Philosophy of the Social Sciences, and British Medical Journal. Schwartz considered the book likely to be the most important work \\"written for modern sexologists unaware or uncertain of their intellectual heritage\\", and wrote that it discussed various topics of great importance to sexologists. He credited Sulloway with suggesting a way of integrating the various methods used in multidisciplinary approaches to the scientific study of sex and with carefully reviewing \\"pages of references, letters, and even margin notes from Freud's personal library to write one of the most valuable studies of the history of both sexology and science\\". He found Sulloway's view that Freud was a \\"scientific heir\\" of Darwin and other 19th-century evolutionary thinkers convincing. He believed that Sulloway made clear that \\"most of Freud's ideas remain remarkably contemporary\\", and concluded that while Sulloway showed that \\"many of the concepts attributed to Freud are not uniquely his\\", his biography \\"increases, in a realistic way, the appreciation of Freud's genius.\\" Haeberle wrote that the book had \\"gained considerable attention and justified praise\\", calling it a model of scholarship. He credited Sulloway with carefully retracing Freud's intellectual development and placing psychoanalysis in a wider historical context through the use of many original sources, such as Freud's library, showing how Freud's thinking was related to the biological theories of his time. He suggested that Sulloway's discussion of the influence of Moll and other sexologists on Freud gave his work special importance for sex researchers. Wollheim described the book as ambitious and erudite, and credited Sulloway with making careful use of sources such as \\"the scientific literature that provides the background to Freud's thought\\" and \\"the polemical literature that surrounded the publication of Freud's own work\\", as well as \\"Freud's personal library\\" and marginalia. He wrote that Sulloway placed Freud in historical context and avoided reliance on Freud's own account of \\"the progress of his influence and reputation\\", and found his work sometimes more coherent and detailed than that of Jones. However, he believed Sulloway failed to provide a detailed treatment of Freud's revised theory of anxiety or to provide a useful discussion of Freud's relationship with Breuer, and was guilty of some inaccuracies in reporting Freud's views. He questioned Sulloway's interpretation of Freud as \\"essentially a biologist of the mind\\". He also faulted Sulloway's criticism of the \\"legend\\" surrounding Freud, writing that it offers a single explanation to material \\"from very different periods and variegated sources\\". Mollinger called the book \\"scholarly\\" and \\"well-researched\\". He considered its strength to be Sulloway's \\"thorough and detailed exploration of Freud's relations to and with Breuer, Fliess, Darwin, and late 19th-Century sexologists\\", but criticized it for Sulloway's \\"lack of awareness of the psychoanalytic process and thus of the essentials of psychoanalysis.\\" Schoenwald credited Sulloway with being the first to demonstrate \\"the pervasive biological content of essential Freudian notions\\" and with offering the best interpretations he had encountered of some issues, such as why Freud posited the existence of the death instinct. However, he also wrote that by \\"Skimping on theoretical structure in a very long book\\", Sulloway \\"heightens the impression that Freud mostly borrowed or took a good deal from others\\" while failing to clarify why Freud borrowed ideas or how he reshaped them, and maintained that Sulloway's interest in criticizing psychoanalysis sometimes lead him into \\"unnecessary all-or-nothing formulations\\", for example concerning the role of Freud's self-analysis. Schoenwald also argued that while Sulloway showed Freud's borrowings from other writers, he failed to explain how Freud created psychoanalysis. Himmelstein described the book as \\"well-researched, enlightening, but ultimately paradoxical\\", writing that it had received much discussion. He credited Sulloway with revealing a Freud \\"about whom one can only muse as a historical curiosity and then quickly rebury\\" and with discrediting the received picture of Freud's development by showing that Freud \\"never labored in total isolation\\" and always had \\"intellectual intimates\\", such as Fliess, as well as with demonstrating that Fliess's ideas were considered respectable when he put them forward and anticipated Freud, and showing that the negative reception of Freud's work had been exaggerated, that psychoanalytic theory was \\"strongly rooted in contemporary biology and sexology\\", that Freudian theory is based in biogenetic and Lamarckian ideas, and that the idea of infantile sexuality was already familiar before Freud. He considered Sulloway's explanation of why \\"official biographers\\" of psychoanalysis would have obscured the origins of Freudian theory plausible, but was less convinced by his suggestion that psychoanalysis is a form of \\"psychobiology\\". He wrote that Sulloway failed to explain why the biological content of Freudian theory had been ignored. He found Sulloway's \\"psychobiological\\" interpretation of Freud overstated despite its \\"kernel of truth\\", and criticized Sulloway for ignoring the most interesting non-orthodox approaches to understanding Freud's work. He concluded that \\"Sulloway's psychobiological reading of Freud seems to lead nowhere; its intellectual implications are nil.\\" Fine considered Freud, Biologist of the Mind, like several other recent books about Freud and psychoanalysis, part of an \\"anti-Freudian crusade\\" that persisted because social scientists who write about Freud \\"do not understand psychoanalysts' dual role as therapists and theoreticians\\" and had led to \\"careless scholarship and inaccurate quotations\\". Other evaluations Freud, Biologist of the Mind was discussed in Time. Later discussions include those by the critic Harold Bloom in The New York Times and Zaretsky in Tikkun. Bloom credited Sulloway with providing an important statement of the \\"sociobiological interpretation of Freud\\", but noted that his own interpretation of Freud was very different. In Bloom's view, what Sulloway considers a reliance upon biology is instead \\"Freud's overcoming of his own anxieties of influence, or the fear of having been flooded out by precursors, and psychoanalysis is thus revealed as a triumphantly strong and deliberate misreading of 19th-century biology.\\" He suggested Freud's work provided some basis to both views. The philosopher Adolf Gr√ºnbaum credited Sulloway with showing that \\"Freud's successive modifications of many of his hypotheses throughout most of his life were hardly empirically unmotivated\\" and thereby disproving the philosopher Karl Popper's argument that psychoanalytic ideas cannot be falsified. The historian Peter Gay described Freud, Biologist of the Mind as an \\"overargued\\" and \\"irritatingly self-indulgent\\" work that suggests \\"some revisions of the accepted view of the Freud-Fliess relationship\\". Gay wrote that while Sulloway presented the book as \\"a great unmasking document\\", his conclusion that Freud's theory had a biological background was not novel. However, he complimented its analysis of Freud's dependence on Fliess and \\"nineteenth-century psychophysics\\". The psychiatrist Allan Hobson called the book \\"pioneering\\", and credited Sulloway with showing that \\"Freud was the careful custodian of his own image and was willing to suppress the truth to protect himself.\\" Hobson has also credited Sulloway with demonstrating that Freud carefully concealed the fact that his psychology was derived from neurobiology. The psychologist Hans Eysenck praised Sulloway, crediting him with exposing many myths which have accumulated around Freud. The historian Roy Porter described Freud, Biologist of the Mind as tendentious, but necessary as a supplement to the \\"hagiographical\\" The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud. The psychoanalyst Joel Kovel credited Sulloway with helping to establish the immense impact of biological thinking on Freud. The historian Paul Robinson described Freud, Biologist of the Mind as being \\"among the most important anti-Freudian writings\\". The critic Alexander Welsh identified Freud, Biologist of the Mind as the key work that discredited psychoanalysis as science. He credited Sulloway with using careful research to \\"historicize Freud's thinking more thoroughly than has ever been done in a single volume.\\" He denied that Sulloway wanted to damage Freud's reputation, suggesting that he would have been incapable of writing the book had he not been sympathetic to Freud. The critic Frederick Crews argued that Sulloway \\"revolutionized our idea of Freud's scientific affinities and habits\\", helping to make possible subsequent works such as Gr√ºnbaum's The Foundations of Psychoanalysis (1984) and the psychologist Malcolm Macmillan's Freud Evaluated (1991). Crews wrote that Freud, Biologist of the Mind was rightly considered a classic work on Freud. He credited Sulloway with helping scholars understand Freud's relationship with Fliess and demonstrating Fliess's enduring influence on Freud. However, he added that the book was limited by Sulloway's lack of access to the complete correspondence between Freud and Fliess, arguing that this made Sulloway more \\"indulgent\\" in his assessment of Freud and Fliess than he should have been. The historian of science Roger Smith credited Sulloway with detailing the \\"lasting biological dimension of Freud's work\\". The psychologist Louis Breger credited Sulloway with \\"exposing the myths that have surrounded Freud and the history of psychoanalysis\\", and expanding on the earlier work of Ellenberger. However, he criticized Sulloway's interpretation of Freud as a \\"crypto-biologist\\". The philosopher Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen and the psychologist Sonu Shamdasani credited Sulloway with demonstrating that Freud's \\"principal 'discoveries' were actually deeply rooted in the biological hypotheses and speculations of his Darwinian era\\".

It was created between 1959 and 1965, by cross-breeding Buff Orpingtons with the commercial strain known in Italy as \\"White America\\". History The Robusta Maculata was created between 1959 and 1965 at the Stazione Sperimentale di Pollicoltura, or experimental chicken breeding centre, of Rovigo, in the Veneto. It was conceived as a dual-purpose breed, and derived from crossing the Buff Orpington with a commercial strain widely raised in Veneto in the 20th century, known in Italy as \\"White America\\". The White America is believed to have been based on mutant white Barnevelders, with contributions from White Leghorn, Rhode Island White and White Rock stock; in early 2012 it was no longer considered a breed. A standard for the Robusta Maculata was published by the now defunct Associazione Nazionale Allevatori Specie Avicole, or national association of breeders of avian species, in the latter part of the 20th century, and is published for historic interest on the website of the Federazione Italiana Associazioni Avicole, the federation of Italian poultry associations, the authority governing poultry breeding in Italy. In early 2012, the breed was not officially recognised by the FIAV. Together with the P√©poi, the Ermellinata di Rovigo, the Robusta Lionata and the Padovana, the Robusta Maculata is one of the five chicken breeds included in the CO.VA. project of Veneto Agricultura, the regional administration for agriculture of the Veneto. The project includes among its aims the conservation of local avian species of limited distribution, and the conservation of genetic resources and biodiversity, and has published a detailed description of the breed. Breed numbers remain low. A study published in 2007 used a figure of approximately 1100 for the total breeding stock, of which approximately 300 were cocks. Characteristics The Robusta Maculata has yellow skin and legs, which are traditionally preferred by Italian consumers of chicken meat. According to the old ANSAV standard, the Robusta Maculata is silver-white, with black and silver neck hackles, and irregular black or dark grey markings elsewhere on the body. The tail and wing-tips are black with dark green lights. The skin and legs are yellow, the ear-lobes are red. The comb is single and well developed, with 6‚Äì8 points. Average weight is for cocks, for hens. The more recent description by Veneto Agricultura gives greater weights: 4.0‚Äì4.5 kg for cocks and 2.8‚Äì3.3 kg for hens. The eggs are pinkish brown and weigh 55‚Äì60 g. Uses The Robusta Maculata is a dual-purpose breed. Hens lay 140‚Äì160 eggs per year. In meat production, birds reach a weight of 1.9‚Äì2.0 kg in four months, and are usually slaughtered at 18 weeks.

However, it is known that Pauli Ka≈çleiok≈´ was an ali'i po'olua. Both Kalani ª≈çpu ªu and Kamehameha accepted him as their own son. A dispute is not suggested by this from Hawaiian tradition as po'olua was a common and formally acknowledged, chiefly acceptance that enhanced the offspring's lineage. He was admitted into manhood by the traditional awa ceremony around 1778. Shortly after that, he was among the first to meet Captain Cook when he came to the islands. He was known to be an expert spear thrower because of his ability to predict where a moving target would go to.John Papa ƒ™ƒ´ (1983). Fragments of Hawaiian History, Edition 2. Bishop Museum Press. Battle of Moku ª≈çhai In 1782 Kamehameha I won his first decisive victory towards conquering the islands. King Kalani ªopu ªu had died a year before leaving his son Kiwala ªo to rule in his place. Ke≈çua K≈´ahuula was left nothing by his father after his death. Enraged by this, Ke≈çua made several provocative moves to insult the new ruler and would become Kamehameha's chief rival during the battle that would ensue. Kamehameha received encouragement and the backing of several prominent figures instead of the new King. Ka≈çleiok≈´ was Ke≈çua's half-brother and supported him in the battle and afterwards, escaped with him to Ka ª≈´. Ke≈çua was convinced by twins Kamanawa and Kame ªeiamoku to travel with them when summoned to Kawaihae by Kamehameha. Ka ª≈çleiok≈´ was among the formal entourage. Ke≈çua was resigned to a probable fate and surrounded himself with his selection of chiefs to die with in his own canoe. Others were ordered to accompany Ka≈çleiok≈´. As they came to shore to greet Kamehameha, Keeaumoku PƒÅpaiahiahi stood from a distance with his men and threw a spear at Ke≈çua, who, after a small fight, was killed. Ka≈çleiok≈´ was saved by command of Kamehameha I, who did not intervene during the struggle moments before. Another popular version of this event states that Kamehameha's brother, Keliimaikai had attempted to intercede for Ke≈çua but failed and when Ka≈çleiok≈´'s group made shore, Keliimaikai demanded that Kamehameha kill the young man and his group stating: \\"You have killed my Hanai, and I will now kill yours\\". To which Kamehameha replied: \\"He shall not die: he is the child of my youth.\\" After that, he was taken into Kamehameha's court and traveled to Oahu where he fought problematic Russians around 1816.

Dragutin \\"Dragi≈°a\\" Lapƒçeviƒá (; 1867‚Äì1939) was a Serbian politician, journalist, and historian. He was one of the founders, alongside Dimitrije Tucoviƒá, of the Serbian Social Democratic Party (existed 1903‚Äì1918), that supported a Balkan Federation during the Kingdom of Serbia. Life Dragi≈°a was born in U≈æice in 1867. The family moved to Po≈æega when Lapƒçeviƒá was the age of three or four. There he completed his grammar school education, after which he continued to educate himself by attending lectures in political science and economics and reading smuggled socialist material into the Kingdom of Serbia at a time when Anti-Socialist Laws were instituted. Initially, he worked as an unskilled laborer, first in a bakery and in a mechanic shop. Later, he was appointed as a municipal clerk. There he gained a reputation as a brilliant public speaker and was elected as municipal opposition president in 1893, but the Serbian government annulled it. Influenced by Svetozar Markoviƒá, he supported the ideas of Karl Kautsky and opposed those of Georgi Plekhanov. He was considered the most important Serbian theoretician of the Marxist labour movement after the death of its founders, and it may well be said that he was its most representative member as an anti-Bolshevik. In him were very clearly incorporated both the revolutionary and the reactionary aspects of that movement. In polemics with the left wing of the party, headed by Dimitrije Tucoviƒá, Lapƒçeviƒá often adopted centrist and right-opportunist positions. From 1905 to 1908 and again from 1912 to 1919, he was a deputy in the Skup≈°tina (Assembly), where he won a great international reputation by voting against war budgets ahead of the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì13 and World War I, advocating a Balkan Federation. In the post-war period, he refused to join the Bolsheviks. He was an opponent of Bolshevik influence in the workers' movement of the then Yugoslavia. From 20 to 23 April 1919, delegates from Social democratic parties of Serbia, Bosnia-Hercegovina, Vojvodina, Montenegro, Croatia-Slavonia and Macedonia met to found the Socialist Workers' Party of Yugoslavia which immediately joined the Communist International against the advice of Lapƒçeviƒá. At the organization's Second Congress held in Vukovar from 20 to 24 June 1920, the less radically inclined centrist faction led by Dragi≈°a Lapƒçeviƒá and ≈Ωarko Topaloviƒá was expelled.

It takes its name from the French mathematician, politician, and military engineer, Lazare Carnot. Such walls were introduced into the design of fortifications from the early nineteenth century. As conceived by Carnot they formed part of an innovative but controversial system of fortification intended to defend against artillery and infantry attack. Carnot walls were employed, together with other elements of Carnot's system, in continental Europe in the years after the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815, especially by the Prussians, other Germans and Austrians. Their adoption was initially resisted by the French themselves and by the British. Lazare Carnot and his system of fortification Lazare Carnot Carnot was born in 1753. He became a military engineer at the age of 20. He became a politician during the French Revolution in 1789. He was responsible for the organization of the campaigns of the French Revolutionary Army, and later served under Napoleon. Carnot's \\"A treatise on the defence of fortified places\\" was published in 1810 with an English translation by Baron de Montalembert published in 1814. In this period the design of fortifications was based on the bastion \\"trace\\" or ground-plan. This had originated in Italy in the 16th century. From the late 17th century the model system of fortification was considered to be that based on the bastion trace of Vauban, Louis XIV's military engineer. Carnot opposed the Bastion system. The elements of his system were: * vertical fire from mortars; * a countersloping glacis; * sorties by defenders; * the \\"Carnot\\" wall and; * separation of defence and attack. A conventional fort would have ramparts on which the cannon were mounted. The ramparts were surrounded by a ditch with vertical, or near vertical, sides, called the scarp (inner wall) and counterscarp (outer wall). The outer side of the ditch would have a glacis, a gently outwardly sloping earth bank at a slightly lower level than the ramparts. The glacis would be topped by a parapet with a flat area called the \\"covered way\\" (because it was \\"covered\\" by fire from defenders on the ramparts). This arrangement was intended to make it difficult for attackers to approach the fort while allowing defenders to observe, and fire on, approaching besiegers at some distance from the fort. As against this method Carnot's system did away with the covered way and steep counterscarp and made the glacis slope back into the ditch. (This is referred to as a countersloping glacis). He placed a loop-holed wall in the ditch of the fortification. This had a chemin des rondes, or sentry path, to the rear allowing defenders to move along behind the wall. As well as firing at attackers the defenders were able to make sorties from behind the wall up the countersloping glacis. Objections to Carnot's system Objections to Carnot's system included that: * it required excessive manpower and firepower; * the detached masonry wall itself would be vulnerable to artillery attack; * sorties were of limited effectiveness as a defensive tactic; * the effectiveness of vertical fire is exaggerated. Adoption of Carnot's ideas in continental Europe The Austrians built impressive fortifications in the 1830s, using Carnot's ideas, at Verona in Italy. These consisted of massive ramparts with a Carnot wall at their foot. In the same period the Russians used the walls in fortifying Warsaw. In Germany examples were built at Coblenz and Ulm. The Woolwich experiments Illustration of the replica Carnot Wall constructed at Woolwich in 1823 - showing the effect of bombardment. Whilst the Carnot wall was extensively employed in fortifications in continental Europe there was resistance to its use in Britain, for the reasons stated above. In 1823 a replica Carnot wall was constructed at Woolwich, Kent to test Carnot's theories. This wall was high and long. The tapering wall was thick at its base and thick at the top. A rampart of equal height with the wall was built in front of it to represent that of a real fort. The idea was that the gunners would be unable to see the wall itself when firing. Experiments with this wall took place in August 1824. Their object was to test whether artillery at a distance could breach the walls by firing at high angles. Those conducting the experiments concluded that the wall could be severely damaged even if the besiegers' gunners could not see it. However it was objected that the Woolwich experiments did not really prove what was claimed. The tests used far more artillery fire than would be likely to be possible in a real siege. Later British forts with a Carnot wall The Carnot wall in the fort at Littlehampton Yaverland Battery Sandown Barrack Battery The objectors did not hold sway indefinitely however and forts with Carnot walls were eventually built in Britain. In his 1849 book James Fergusson outlined the advantages of the Carnot wall, though without wholly endorsing its use. He said that such walls would be cheaper to construct. They would last longer than the usual scarp wall with a \\"mass of earth at its back always tending to overthrow it\\". In addition it would be difficult to scale the wall as the besiegers would have to use ladders to reach the top and the same ladders to descend the other side, while all the time facing assault by defenders. Fergusson also commented that the 1824 Woolwich experiments, which had influenced subsequent fort design, had given \\"every possible advantage in favour of the attack\\". He argued that, even were a breach to be made in the wall, the defenders could easily attack the besiegers, making an assault on the fort hazardous. His final point was that in any case the wall would be hidden behind a rampart far higher, in relation to the height of the wall, than that at Woolwich, so that the enemy artillery would be not able to significantly damage it. The first fort to be built in Britain with a Carnot wall was in 1854 at the mouth of the river Arun at Littlehampton in West Sussex. This was high with open-angled bastions. In 1857 a very similar fort was constructed at Shoreham along the coast from Littlehampton. The wall there included Caponiers, as also advocated by Carnot. Following the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom of 1859 several forts with Carnot walls were built.

Although the school is called a secondary school, it offers classes for grades one through eleven. The school courses are taught in Uzbek. Isfana Secondary School was established in 1936. The school's first graduating class was in 1938. The school was initially located at the present-day site of Vocational School No. 48. Its current building was completed in 1989.  History  In 1936, Budyonny Elementary School in Isfana was turned into Isfana Seven-Year School. In the USSR, seven-year schools were incomplete secondary general- education schools that originated in 1921 and existed until the 1950s. In the 1930s, there were very few adequately trained instructors in Isfana. Several instructors from across Osh Region and the neighboring republics were sent to work initially at Budyonny and then Isfana School. The Ministry of Education of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic (Uzbek SSR) sent instructors R. Tulamov from Bekabad in 1934 and O. To ªqtasinov, Sh. Inoyatov, and K. Dundiyev from Tashkent in 1938 to teach at the school. The school was initially located at the present-day site of Vocational School No. 48. The first building of the school was divided into three parts. One part was an orphanage. Another part was the office of Leilek District's public education authority. The remaining part of the building had classrooms where students attended classes. The orphanage was closed in 1949. According to data collected in 1940, 322 students were being educated in 18 classes at the time. In 1960, Isfana School was turned into an eight-year school. In the USSR, eight-year schools were incomplete secondary general-education polytechnical schools that were oriented toward labor. From 1960 to 1969, G ªulom Rajapov, Rizoqul G ªaffarov, and Xosiyat Qunduzova served as principal of the school. In 1973, the school was transformed into a secondary school and the term of study was extended to ten years. After the transformation of the school into a secondary school the following people served as principal: Ibrohim Xolmurzayev, Hurmatoy G ªoynazarova (1986‚Äì1996), Dadajon Komilov (1996‚Äì2000), Mamlakat Uzoqova (2000‚Äì2003), Dadajon Komilov (2003‚Äì2010), Inomjon Ro ªziboyev (2010‚Äì2016), and Davronbek Xudoynazarov (2016‚Äìpresent). On 4 September 1999, Jumaboy Boboyev, a geography teacher, opened classes for perceptive students in Isfana Secondary School. These classes were later turned into a gymnasium school, namely the Uzbek Gymnasium.  General framework and curriculum  At Isfana School, children are accepted to first grade at the age of six or seven, depending on the child's individual development. The eleven-year school term is split into elementary (grades 1-4), middle (grades 5-9) and senior (grades 10-11) classes. Attending a \\"basic\\" nine-year (elementary and middle) program is compulsory. Grades 10-11 are optional. As in many parts of the country, at Isfana Secondary School children of elementary classes are normally separated from other classes within their own floor of the school building. They are taught, ideally, by a single teacher through all four elementary grades (except for physical education and foreign languages). Starting from the fifth grade, each academic subject is taught by a dedicated specialty teacher. The school curriculum for senior students includes subjects like mathematics, informatics, physics, chemistry, geography, biology, arts, music, physical education, history, and astronomy. Like many other schools in Kyrgyzstan, Isfana Secondary School is a double shift school where two streams of students (morning shift and evening shift) share the same facility. The reason for this is that school capacity is insufficient to teach all of the students on a normal, morning-to-afternoon, schedule. The school year extends from the beginning of September to the end of May and is divided into four terms. The school curriculum at Isfana Secondary School is fixed: unlike in some Western countries, schoolchildren cannot choose what subjects to study. Students are graded on a five-step scale, ranging in practice from 2 (\\"unacceptable\\") to 5 (\\"excellent\\"); 1 is a rarely used sign of extreme failure. Teachers regularly subdivide these grades (i.e. 4+, 5-) in daily use, but term and year results are graded strictly 2, 3, 4, or 5.  Medium of instruction  The medium of instruction at Isfana Secondary School is Uzbek. In addition to Uzbek, students also study three other languages, namely English, Kyrgyz, and Russian. Like in many other Uzbek-language schools in Kyrgyzstan, the future of teaching in Uzbek remains uncertain at Isfana Secondary School. Following the 2010 South Kyrgyzstan ethnic clashes, Kyrgyz authorities started to take measures to remove the Uzbek language from public life and to forcibly switch Uzbek schools to Kyrgyz. As part of these efforts, the number of teaching hours allocated to Kyrgyz language and literature lessons at Uzbek schools was significantly increased at the expense of Uzbek language and literature lessons. Currently there are not enough school textbooks in Uzbek and the Kyrgyz government is unwilling to provide them, claiming that it does not have enough funds. As Kyrgyz officials strongly oppose the use of textbooks printed in Uzbekistan, currently the majority of Uzbek schoolchildren in Kyrgyzstan, including the students of Isfana Secondary School study in Uzbek using Kyrgyz textbooks.  Notable alumni  *Usmon Matkarimov (1922-1989) ‚Äî graduated from Isfana secondary school in 1939; served as the head of Isfana's kolkhoz; greatly contributed to the development of Isfana and Leilek District; Usmon Matkarimov Gymnasium and Boarding School is named after him.

Born in Germany, Strubberg spent many decades in the United States. In Texas, he used the pseudonym Dr. Friedrich Schubbert. He designed the Vereins Kirche in Fredericksburg. Strubberg spent the last few decades of his life as an author in Germany. Family background and early life The man known in Texas as Dr. Friedrich Schubbert claimed to be of royal descent and was born Fred√®ric Armand Strubberg on March 18, 1806, in Kassel, Hesse, Germany.Casselsche Polizey- und Commerzien-Zeitung, April 24, 1806 His father was tobacco merchant Henry Fr√©d√©ric Strubberg, son of Fr√©d√©ric Rodolphe Strubberg and Emilie Cordesse.Kirchenbuch der Oberneust√§dter franz√∂sischen Gemeinde zu Kassel Henry Strubberg was a grandson of Anna Amalie and her husband Christian Friedrich Strubberg. Fred√®ric's assertion to be a great-great-grandson of Frederick I of Sweden based on an alleged morganatic marriage between Frederick I and the widow of a General Count Wilmsdorf-Brevendorf in the years 1717‚Äì1720 and that Anna Amalie was an offspring of this marriage.Strubberg, F.

(1928), Heft 1, p. 19-20 His mother was Frederique Elise of the aristocratic Marville family. Strubberg grew up in a house of wealth and privilege, groomed for a career in the mercantile business. The United States Strubberg made his first voyage to the United States as a representative of the mercantile houses, stopping at Niagara Falls in 1828, and returning home to Hesse in 1829. For the next decade, Strubberg remained in Germany as an integral partner in his father's tobacco business.Barba (1913), pp. 30, 31 His return visit to the North American continent was also connected to the mercantile business and included North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, New York, Maryland, New Orleans, and Havana.Barba (1913), pp.32, 33 While en route to Texas in the early 1840s, Strubberg visited Louisville, Kentucky and enrolled in a local medical school at the urging of one of the school's instructors. It was here he earned a medical degree in two years. Upon receiving his diploma, Strubberg visited Memphis, Tennessee and purchased a stallion, which he rode to Texas. Strubberg passed through Dallas and traveled down to the Rio Grande.Barba (1913), p.34 From there, he journeyed to the Leona River into what became Uvalde County. He looked upon this area as a place to build his new life, and returned to Memphis to enlist others to help him with the new settlement. He went north east by way of San Antonio, Austin, Nacogdoches and Natchez, Mississippi, then up the Mississippi River to Memphis. When he returned to the banks of the Leona, he was accompanied by three other men, re-entering Texas from Shreveport, Louisiana and across Caddo Lake.Barba (1913), p.35 By this point in time, he was operating under the alias of Dr. Schubbert.Barba (1913), p.36 Strubberg had teamed up with Henry Francis Fisher by February 1845, and, according to Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels, began trying to lure emigrating Adelsverein settlers to a colony that Strubberg and Fisher were starting in Milam County.Solms (2000) p.131 When John O. Meusebach succeeded Prince Solms as Commissioner-General of the Adelsverein, he followed advice from Henry Fisher and in June 1846 appointed Strubberg to lead colonists into what became known as Fredericksburg.King (1967) p.126King (1967) pp. 76, 91 Strubberg designed the Vereins Kirche community building in the center of Fredericksburg.Morgenthaler (2007) p. 60 Without authorization from Meusebach, Strubberg led an armed group of colonists into Comanche territory. Shawnee scouts reported seeing 40,000 to 60,000 Kickapoo at the Llano River, and Strubberg's group retreated to Fredericksburg.Morgenthaler (2007) p. 59 When Meusebach was not deterred and decided to make his own journey into Comanche territory, Strubberg instigated a failed coup d'√©tat against Meusebach. Ninety-five colonists signed a petition urging Meusebach to remain as Commissioner-General.King (1967) pp.106, 107 On July 12, 1847, Meusebach sent Strubberg a letter of dismissal from his position as director of Fredericksburg.King (1967) p.127 Jean Jacques von Coll was appointed his successor. Strubberg retreated to Nassau Plantation, and refused to relinquish the position to von Coll. After Hermann Spiess succeeded Meusebach as Commissioner-General of the Adelsverein, he engaged Strubberg in a gunfight on October 28, 1847, while trying to oust him from the plantation. Strubberg became active in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War until its end in 1848. He then joined medical teams in Arkansas to combat several epidemics in the area. He built a home, became a slave owner, and opened a medical practice in Camden, Arkansas. Return to Europe A freak accident in 1854, with an insect sting to his eye, brought his return to Europe for medical treatments. By 1860, he was again living in Kassel with his sister Emilie. There he changed careers and became an author, both of fiction and non-fiction.Barba (1913), pp.50, 51 Personal life and death Three times Strubberg was engaged to be married. While in New York sometime in the 1830s or 1840s, his engagement to an heiress led to a duel over her affections and the death of his opponent. Strubberg fled New York with the intent of seeking a new life in Texas. During his years in Arkansas, he became engaged to the owner of a slave plantation. It is unclear if this last engagement also led to marriage. Strubberg became a slave owner, but whether that was through marriage to his fianc√©e in Arkansas, or in his own right, is unknown.Barba (1913), p.50 The first engagement was in 1826 to Antoinette Sattler in Germany. She was the daughter of a fellow merchant. A non-fatal duel with a romantic rival for her affections coincided with Strubberg's departure for his first journey to the United States.Barba (1913), p.29 Antoinette did not make the trip with him, and he apparently never saw her again until the latter part of his life. He re-connected with Antoinette in the last decade of his life, after his return to Germany. Unknown to Strubberg, she had spent the intervening years in an asylum and had only recently been released. The two were married. Antoinette became afflicted with a form of dementia and had to be institutionalized and died in the asylum.Barba (1913), p. 54 His sister Emilie with whom he had been living died in late January or early February 1876 (buried Febr. 2).Strubberg, F.

History The \\"dummy\\" Baldwin steam engine had begun pulling excursions to the \\"hill\\" in June 1884 (Ephram H. Minnigh was the park manager) and on July 4, Colonel John H.

Amusements at Round Top Park included target shooting, and its \\"Merry-Go-Round\\" was offered for sale in 1894. In 1886, the Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial Association purchased \\"the grove in and around Round Top\\" and after the 1889 Pennsylvania Reserves reunion in the pavilion, the GBMA removed the buildings in 1896.

Another reviewer called the collection ‚Äúunderstated, splendidly wrought.‚Äù\\"Watering by Catharine Savage Brosman\\", Virginia Quarterly Review, Winter 1973, p. xiii. D. E.

It was founded in 1917 as St. Agnes Elementary School by Monsignor Peter Quealy. A major portion of the student body reside in Rockville Centre, and neighboring towns. It is joined by a collection of other schools as part of the Diocese of Rockville Centre school system. St. Agnes Cathedral School is the largest elementary school in the Diocese of Rockville Centre. The school resides on campus along with St. Agnes Cathedral, the base of the Diocese of Rockville Centre.  History  Founded in 1917 by Monsignor Peter Quealy, St. Agnes Cathedral School was originally named St. Agnes Elementary School. The ten-room school house had a founding faculty made up of five Dominican Sisters. The school‚Äôs first principal was Mother Petra, who served as Principal until her death in 1939. The increasing need for Catholic elementary education in Rockville Centre made the school soon outgrow their ten-room building. This led to the purchase of the Clinton Avenue building from the Rockville Centre Public School District in 1957. The North and South Wings of the school were later added during renovations in the 1960s.  Facilities  The Saint Agnes School is located on the Saint Agnes Complex, which consists of several properties. Saint Agnes' campus includes: * Recently renovated Science Lab * Gymnasium * Melton Auditorium * 3 Performance Spaces * 37 Classroom Spaces * Lecture Space * Outdoor Playground, Indoor and Outdoor Play Areas and Fields * SMARTboards in all classrooms for grades K-8 * Library and Virtual Library Access * Internet Access in all Buildings and Classrooms  Secondary school placement  In recent years, St. Agnes students have scored higher than other local schools on state assessments, receiving average scores no lower than a 97.1. The scores of St. Agnes students to local public districts as well as fellow Diocese of Rockville Centre schools are comparatively higher. Following their graduation from St. Agnes, students in recent years have gone on to attend various secondary schools on Long Island, including: Chaminade High School, Kellenberg Memorial High School, Sacred Heart Academy, Holy Trinity High School, Friends Academy, Long Island Lutheran. In addition, Saint Agnes has also sent several students in recent years to secondary schools in Manhattan, including: The Marymount School, Convent of the Sacred Heart, Dominican Academy, Regis High School and Xavier High School.

In 1876, Norelius transferred supervision of the home to the Board of the Society of Mercy, part of the Minnesota Conference of the Augustana Synod. The home was entirely rebuilt after a tornado demolished it in 1872 and again after a fire in 1899. The home relocated to its present site, six miles west of Red Wing, Minnesota, in 1926. Between sixty and seventy children were housed at the Vasa Children's Home during the early 1900s. In 1954, the home's focus shifted from housing orphaned or neglected children to caring for children with disabilities. The fourth building of the Vasa Children's Home near Red Wing, Minnesota, 1907 Modern era The fifth and current building, built in 1973, houses children and young adults with disabilities between the ages of 7 and 22.

It is currently held and exhibited at the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris. History This picture was included in the Exposition Universelle of 1867, and was bought from the artist in the same year by the Comte de Nieuwerkerque, Director of Museums, for Napoleon III, at the price of 2000 French francs. It was part of the Emperor's personal property, and was allotted to the Louvre by the Tribunal de la Seine, along with other paintings, on 12 February 1879. In 1881, it was exhibited in the Luxembourg, with the title Le puits noir (The Black Ravine), which is really the name of another work painted in 1869.See Le puits noir, 1869. The landscape is currently housed and exhibited at the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris, and represents a gorge, a ravine through which runs a winding stream, its bed littered with rocks, between steep walls covered with wild vegetation. The stream depicted is the Loue, a capricious creek flowing through the village of Ornans, where Courbet was born. The artist seems to have returned to this spot several times: it can be recognised in a number of his paintingsAcquired by the Louvre in 1950 and now at the Mus√©e des Beaux- Arts et d'arch√©ologie de Besan√ßon. Another of these landscape works, somewhat smaller than the present painting, exactly resembles it as far as the details of execution are concerned. It is dated 1866 and is in the Museum of Montpellier and is entitled Solitude. Of this landscape, Courbet wrote: > It is perhaps the best I have ever painted; it shows the Loue walled up > between vast boulders of mossy rock, with thick sunlit foliage in the > background.G. Courbet, Letters of Gustave Courbet, University of Chicago > Press (1992). Courbet loved to seek out some unspoilt corner in these lonely gorges, where the damp atmosphere conveys the impression of a strange world from which the primordial waters have only just receded. In this work, in which one senses the enthusiasm of the artist, Courbet's technique is at its peak of perfection. He has only used the brush in the background shadows; elsewhere the painting has been done with the palette knife. Courbet crushes his pigments and spreads them diagonally with his knife, thus letting underlying wads of paint show through: this creates the effect of transparency and depth as rich as those obtained by means of glazes in the work of earlier artists. His splendid greens evoke the luxuriance of a semi-aquatic world where vegetation runs riot.See J. Lindsay, Gustave Courbet his life and art, Jupiter Books (1977); F.

Born in Edinburgh, Scotland he had spells with Partick Thistle, Preston North End, Sheffield United, Liverpool and Barnsley St. Peter's before retiring. Playing career Drummond began his career at Scottish club Partick Thistle in 1889 before moving South of the border to sign for Lancashire club Preston North End, with whom he made a scoring debut in The Football League against West Bromwich Albion on 13 September 1890. Drummond was one of three players signed from Preston by Sheffield United in the spring of 1891 after chairman Charles Stokes decided the club needed to use its financial position to attract more capable players as the club looked for election to the Football League. He became a regular in the side for the following seasons and at the end of the 1892‚Äì93 season he scored the only goal as United took on Accrington in a test match which saw The Blades promoted to Division One for the first time in their history. Anecdotal reports of the match said that the pitch was in a terrible state and Drummond was almost the only player to be able to keep his feet, something that he attributed to painting the soles of his boots with black lead to prevent the mud from sticking. He went on to make 89 competitive appearances for the club and scored 24 goals. Drummond joined Liverpool in the summer of 1884 for whom he made 18 appearances in total, scoring one goal. After one season on Merseyside he returned to Yorkshire to sign for Barnsley St. Peter's where he saw out the remainder of his career. Personal life Drummond had been an apprentice shipyard carpenter as a boy and returned to work in the Dumbarton shipyards after his retirement from football, reportedly working until the age of 78.

Initially a revolt by local Catholics against their Protestant overlords, many regional powers became involved as it potentially affected control of the Valtellina alpine passes. A loose alliance of France, Venice and the Duchy of Savoy supported the Three Leagues against the Grison rebels, backed by the Habsburg Monarchy. The conflict threatened to draw the Swiss Confederation in the Thirty Years War. Background Map of the Three Leagues and surrounding lands The Three Leagues were a federation of three states (the League of God's House, the League of the Ten Jurisdictions and the Grey League) in the alpine valleys around the city of Chur. Due to their position, they controlled a number of key alpine passes. The League was also not a unified state and virtually all external affairs were settled by referendum. At the beginning of the 17th century, the regional powers around the Leagues attempted to secure transit and trade routes through the League passes. For France and Venice the alpine passes represented important trade routes. For the Austrian Habsburgs, they were the shortest route between Habsburg controlled Milan and Austrian Tyrol.Swiss History accessed 16 January 2012 In 1602, France secured some of the alpine passes. A year later Venice bought the transit right through the passes and an alliance for 10 years. This agreement between the Leagues and Venice angered the Spanish Habsburgs. In Milan, Don Pedro Henriquez de Acevedo, Count of Fuentes, declared an embargo against the Leagues and built a fortification, the Forte di Fuentes, at Montecchio on Lake Como at the entrance to the League controlled Valtellina valley.Graub√ºnden's religious history (PDF; 3.95 MB) Politically, the Leagues were split into pro-Habsburg and pro-Venice parties. In 1607, about 6,000 armed men met together in a bitter Landsgemeinde or cantonal assembly. A court was set up that initially supported the French-Venetian faction and pronounced judgments against the Habsburg faction for a variety of crimes. Shortly thereafter the Habsburg faction gained power and returned judgments against the French-Venetian side. At the same time, the Protestant and even a few Catholic representatives turned their ire on the Bishop of Chur, Giovanni or Johann V of Flugi. They criticized the Bishop for working against the interests of the Leagues and for living outside the Diocese in Feldkirch or at F√ºrstenburg in Vintschgau. The citizens then got a court to issue an arrest warrant for the Bishop. In response, the Bishop fled to Feldkirch and refused to return and face a trial. The Bishop remained in exile until 1610, but the trial of the Bishop illustrated the religious and secular conflicts in the Leagues. After the Bishop returned, he was forced to flee twice more, once in 1612 and a second time in 1617. J√∂rg Jenatsch and Valtellina murders Rietberg Castle, home of Pompeius Planta J√∂rg Jenatsch In 1618, the young radical J√∂rg Jenatsch became a member of the court of 'clerical overseers' and a leader of the anti-Habsburg faction. The popular court in Thusis, which was associated with the overseers, outlawed many leading men from the pro-Habsburg faction, notably Rudolf Planta and his brother Pompeius Planta. With the support of the anti-Habsburg court, armed mobs attacked and arrested several pro-Habsburg leaders including the archpriest Nicholas Rusca and the provost at Johann Baptista who was known as Zambra. The Planta brothers escaped the mob, but their estates were burned. The mobs brought the captured men to the court in Thusis. Zambra was accused of conspiring with the Spanish, convicted and executed. Nicholas Rusca was beaten and died before the court could sentence him to death. The court also handed down 157 convictions against men who had escaped the mobs. The harsh judgments of the Thusis court against a number of Catholics in the Valtellina, led to a conspiracy to drive the Protestants out of this southern valley. The leader of the conspiracy, Giacomo Robustelli of the Planta family, had ties to Madrid, Rome and Paris. On the evening of 18/19 July 1620, a force of Valtellina rebels supported by Imperial and Spanish troops marched into Tirano and began killing Protestants. When they finished in Tirano, they marched to Teglio, Sondrio and further down the valley killing every Protestant that they found. Between 500 and 600 people were killed on that night and in the following four days. The attack drove nearly all the Protestants out of the valley, prevented further Protestant incursions and took the Valtellina out of the Three Leagues. During 1620, Pompeius Planta, believing that enough time had passed, returned home to Rietberg Castle. However, on 24 February 1621, a force of anti-Habsburg troops led by J√∂rg Jenatsch assembled to attack the castle. Early in the morning on 25 February, the troops attacked the castle and killed Pompeius Planta as he attempted to flee. According to one version of the story, Pompeius attempted to hide in a chimney, but was discovered by a dog. He was attacked by the raiders and killed by J√∂rg Jenatsch with an axe. Catholic response Drawings of the League/Duke Henri de Rohan invasion of the Valtellina. Emboldened by the murder of Pompeius Planta, the Protestant forces in the Three Leagues assembled an army to retake the Valtellina and other subject lands. The army was thrown together from a number of villages and was poorly armed and led. They slowly marched toward Bormio. However, before they even reached the town, the army disintegrated and the remnants returned to the Leagues. This attempted invasion gave the Spanish and Austrians an excuse to invade the Leagues. By the end of October, Spain and Austria had occupied all of Graubunden. The allied Swiss Confederation was divided along religious lines and only Bern and Zurich sent help. The Catholic central Swiss cantons intervened under the abbot of Disentis on the side of the Spaniards and Austrians. In January 1622, Graub√ºnden had to cede the M√ºstair, the Lower Engadine and Pr√§ttigau valleys. The treaty also forbade the Protestant religion in these valleys. In response, in 1622, the Pr√§ttigau valley rebelled against the Austrians and drove them out of the valley. The Austrians invaded the valley twice more, attempting to reimpose the Catholic faith, in 1623-24 and 1629-31. In 1622 the Catholic Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples appointed the Capuchins to spread the faith in the region. On 24 April 1622, the leader of the Capuchin mission, St. Fidelis of Sigmaringen, was murdered by Protestant peasants while on his way from Sewis to Gr√ºsch near Chur. His death ended the first Capuchin missionary effort. A second attempt, to convert Misocco and Calanca, was undertaken by the Capuchins in 1635. In 1623 the Leagues entered into an alliance with France, Savoy and Venice. Cardinal Richelieu saw the Valtellina as an opportunity to weaken the Spanish. J√ºrg Jenatsch and Ulysses von Salis used French money to hire an 8,000 man mercenary army and drive out the Austrians. The peace treaty of Monzon (5 March 1626) between France and Spain, confirmed the political and religious independence of the Valtellina. In 1627 the French withdrew from the Valtellina valley, which was then occupied by Papal troops. Starting in 1631 the League, under the French Duke Henri de Rohan, started to expel the Spaniards. However, Richelieu still did not want to hand the valley over to its residents. When it became clear that the French intended to remain permanently in the Leagues, but would not force the Valtellina to convert to Protestantism, J√ºrg Jenatsch (now a mercenary leader) converted in 1635 to the Catholic faith. In 1637, he rebelled and allied with Austria and Spain. His rebellion along with the rebellion of 31 other League officers forced the French to withdraw without a fight. End On 24 January 1639, J√ºrg Jenatsch was killed during Carnival by an unknown attacker who was dressed as a bear. The attacker may have been a son of Pompeius Planta or an assassin hired by the local aristocracy. According to legend he was killed by the same axe that he used on Pompeius Planta. On 3 September 1639 the Leagues agreed with Spain to bring the Valtellina back under League sovereignty, but with the promise to respect the free exercise of the Catholic faith. Treaties with Austria in 1649 and 1652, brought the M√ºstair and Lower Engadine valleys back under the authority of the Three Leagues.

The titles of the three volumes, Parting the Waters, Pillar of Fire, and At Canaan's Edge, were all drawn from aspects of the Old Testament Book of Exodus - namely, the Crossing of the Red Sea, the manifestation of God that allowed the Israelites to travel by night, and the Promised Land, which Moses was able to see into, but did not live long enough to enter. A one-volume summary of the series was published in 2013. Background In the early 1980s, Branch planned to spend three years writing about America during the civil rights era, focusing on Martin Luther King Jr. As Branch proceeded with his work, the project ended up becoming a 24-year endeavor. Branch described his approach to writing the King trilogy as follows: > Storytelling--to do it in storytelling. I--one of the reasons I wanted to do > it was that I knew this had an enormous impact, somewhat like the Civil War > and Reconstruction period a century before. But most of the books I read > seemed to me analytical and argumentative, reinventing new labels of > analysis. And I felt that they didn't have the power to really describe what > happened at the personal level, which is where I think we really learn about > race across the divisions that we have. > And so I really resolved from some lessons out of my experience that I > wanted to try to keep it at a storytelling level and follow the stories > wherever they went. I just didn't know that there would be so many of them > or that they would be from such broad context; that I'd be chronicling > King's relationship with Rabbi Abraham Heschel or something like--you know, > these are things that I didn't--had no way of anticipating. So I just kind > of--I followed storytelling, but it tumbled me off into more worlds than I'd > planned on. Parting the Waters Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, 1954‚Äì63, the first book in the trilogy, was published in 1988. Events detailed in this volume include the Montgomery bus boycott, the 1961 Freedom Rides, the 1963 Birmingham campaign and Children's Crusade, and the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. It shared the 1989 Pulitzer Prize for History with James McPherson's history of the American Civil War, Battle Cry of Freedom. It also won the 1988 National Book Critics Circle Award for General Nonfiction, and was a 1989 finalist for the National Book Award in the Non-Fiction category. The cover of the book uses a reversed portion of the iconic photograph of the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery taken by Look magazine photographer James Karales. Pillar of Fire The second volume, Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years, 1963‚Äì65, was published in 1998. It covers such events as the Assassination of President Kennedy, the Mississippi Freedom Summer, and King's acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize. At Canaan's Edge The final book in the trilogy, At Canaan's Edge: America in the King Years, 1965‚Äì1968, was published in 2006. Among the subjects it covers are the Selma to Montgomery marches, the 1966 Chicago Open Housing Movement, Dr. King's participation in the Anti-Vietnam War movement, the Watts Riots, and the events leading up to King's assassination. It was the winner of the Chicago Tribunes Heartland Prize for Non-Fiction in 2006. The King Years: Historic Moments in the Civil Rights Movement A one-volume summary of Branch's trilogy, The King Years: Historic Moments in the Civil Rights Movement was published by Simon & Schuster in 2013. HBO miniseries In 2010 Oprah Winfrey's production company, Harpo, announced that it would be partnering with HBO to produce a miniseries based on Branch's trilogy, to be written by Robert Schenkkan.

The American Star Bicycle was invented in 1880 by G. W. Pressey and manufactured by the H. B. Smith Machine Company in Smithville, Burlington County, New Jersey. It was characterized by a small wheel in front to avoid the problem of tipping forward inherent in other high wheelers. A Star bicycle was photographed being ridden down the steps in front of the United States Capitol in 1885 to demonstrate its longitudinal stability, and Star bicycles were used for the sport of bicycle polo in the mid-1880s. Pressey sued Smith in 1887 for royalties. The name \\"Star\\" was attributed to the double star arrangement of the spokes. Details The small front wheel, in diameter, steered, and the large rear wheel, in diameter, provided the forward driving force and bore most of the rider's weight. The light load on the front wheel was reported to have made it skittish on loose surfaces such as sand and gravel. American Stars incorporated pneumatic tires very soon after they were developed, and braking was provided by a spoon brake acting on the rear wheel and actuated by a lever on the right handlebar. A pair of independent treadle mechanisms collected power from the rider's legs instead of a crank. Power from each treadle was transferred to the rear wheel by a leather strap over a ratchet mechanism. (See image in gallery below.) The attachment point of the leather strap could be moved to provide multiple gear ratios, and both treadles could be pressed simultaneously for a brief increase in torque. A spring attached to the ratchet rewound the strap when the foot was raised. This treadle arrangement also allowed riders of different sizes to ride the same bike comfortably without modification, as the pedals were not constrained to trace a circle about an axle. An undated advertisement lists prices from $75 to $120, depending on wheel size and finish, which varied from \\"plainly finished machine; painted and striped\\" to \\"all nickled and polished, except the rim, which is painted and striped in gold.\\" Variations Copeland steam bicycle, a steam-powered Star, 1884 Smith also offered tricycles in 1887 and 1888 and patented a steam tricycle in 1889. At the first Maricopa County Fair in 1884, Lucius Copeland demonstrated his steam bicycle, one of the first motorcycles, a steam-powered Star high-wheeler. It was claimed to have traveled in 4 minutes, at a steam pressure of , and carried enough water and fuel to run for an hour. \\"American Star\\" was also a brand name used by a Japanese bicycle manufacturer in the 1960s and 1970s. Songs The Smith Machine Co. commissioned several musical compositions to promote the American Star Bicycle. In 1882, Chas. W. Nathan composed the Star Bicycle Gallop for piano, and in 1883, John Ford composed The Star Rider.

Purpose The Illinois General Assembly created the Teachers‚Äô Retirement System of the State of Illinois (TRS or the System) in 1939 for the purpose of providing retirement annuities, and disability and survivor benefits for educators employed in public schools outside the city of Chicago. The System's enabling legislation is in the Illinois Pension Code at 40 ILCS 5/16-101 Membership TRS members fall into the following categories: active, inactive, annuitant, and beneficiary. Active members are full-time, part-time, and substitute Illinois public school personnel employed outside the city of Chicago in positions requiring licensure by the Illinois State Board of Education. Persons employed in certain state agencies and statewide or national organizations related to education are also active TRS members. As of June 30, 2013, there were 160,692 active members. Inactive members are no longer contributing to the System but have service credit that will entitle them to draw a benefit or refund when statutory eligibility requirements are met. As of June 30, 2013, there were 120,325 inactive members. Annuitants are persons receiving a retirement annuity or disability retirement annuity. Beneficiaries are persons receiving a survivor benefit or reversionary annuity. As of June 30, 2013, there were 108,783 annuitants and beneficiaries. Benefits Subject to various qualification requirements, members and annuitants of TRS may be eligible for a range of benefits including: *retirement annuity *death benefits *disability benefits *health insurance (post-retirement) Funding TRS has several sources of funding: * member contributions, * investment income, * employer contributions, and * appropriations from Illinois state government. Creation of Tier II Public Act 96‚Äì0889, which was signed into law in the spring of 2010, adds a new section to the Pension Code that applies different benefits to anyone who first contributes to TRS on or after January 1, 2011 and does not have previous service credit with a pension system that has reciprocal rights with TRS. These members are referred to as ‚ÄúTier II‚Äù members. Changes from the ‚ÄúTier I‚Äù pension law include raising the minimum eligibility to draw a retirement benefit to age 67 with 10 years of service, initiating a cap on the salaries used to calculate retirement benefits, and limiting cost-of- living annuity adjustments to the lesser of 3 percent or half of the annual increase in the Consumer Price Index, not compounded. The retirement formula is unchanged. The new pension law does not apply to anyone who has TRS service prior to January 1, 2011. These members remain participants of Tier I.

History The remains of the star fort in the central part of the islet There are still visible on the island of Pessegueiro enormous blocks cut from the rocks of the island, and sunk in the waters around it. Similarly, there have been discovered various tanks for salting fish, that were used during the early Roman occupation of the region. These tanks were used in the salting and processing of fish, which was traded and transported to Rome. In 1588, Terzi began the planning for a fort on the island, as part of a project to construct an artificial port that would link the island to the coast (then approved by cardinal Alberto, the vice-King). Alexandre Massay substituted Terzi in 1590, beginning the construction of the port, while work on the artificial port continued. The construction was interrupted in 1598, when Massay was transferred to Vila Nova de Milfontes, to begin work on the construction of a fort to defend the inlet to the River Mira. Construction began once again in 1603, but were interrupted shortly later. It is unclear, but construction on the island was likely completed between 1661 and 1690, although the fort and artificial port remained incomplete. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake was responsible for damage to the chapel, and the batteries over the casemates. Architecture The Fort of Pessegueiro Island dominates the beach and coast of Pessegueiro, an area of southern Porto Covo. The island and fort are located opposite another fort, referred to as the Fort of Pessegueiro. Of the fort that remains on the island, the existing structure exists in ruins. It is a star-shaped fort, consisting of four symmetrical, triangular bulwarks and with casemates in the central part of the fortification. On the opposite end of the main entrance is a hermitage, dedicated to Santo Alberto (). The fort was part of group that included an artificial port, defended by a breakwater also connected the island to the rocky outcroppings to the north of the island: the Penedo do Cavalo.

Credit unions are member-owned financial cooperatives operated for the purpose of promoting thrift, providing credit and other financial services to their members. Credit unions in the UK now offer a wide range of services to their members; including current accounts, payroll deductions, standing orders and insurance. Co-operative or mutual organisations engaging in cooperative banking, such as building societies, have existed in the UK since the 18th century.  History  Institutions known as mutual societies grew out of the friendly society movement of the 18th century, with the first mutual insurer, Equitable Life, being founded in 1762. Formalised under the Friendly Societies Act 1819, mutual institutions predated the welfare state and were formed to meet the needs of a growing urban working class. This communitarian self-help movement allowed small regular individual contributions to be pooled for mutual collective benefit, obtaining the same economies of scope and scale necessary for providing insurance and financial products. Mutual societies helped to raise funds for housing and consumer durables at a time when commercial banks were still exclusively commercial lenders.Shay (1992) Building societies were formed as small temporary societies by worker co- operatives, pooling resources to build local houses and subsequently allocating them among members by drawing lots. Once all members were housed, these organisations were typically wound up, although some became permanent societies in an effort to promote wider home ownership, as exemplified by the Leeds Permanent Building Society.Anonymous (1994b) The first recorded credit union in the United Kingdom was formed in Derry, Northern Ireland, in 1960. Inspired by the formation of the first credit unions in the Republic of Ireland, six individuals pooled their savings and formally established the Derry Credit Union. In Great Britain, modern day credit unions emerged in the mid-1960s in London and Scotland. The first recorded British credit union was the Hornsey Co-operative, established 1964 in North London by Caribbean families, and is the foundation of what is now London Capital Credit Union. Credit unions were popular in the Caribbean and large numbers of first generation Caribbean-British would become members of credit unions. By 1998, 38% of Caribbean British adults were members of credit unions. In Scotland, several credit unions were established by immigrants from Ireland. In Glasgow, credit union coverage and membership remains broad: one in six Glaswegians is member of a credit union, with nine employee credit unions and 25 community credit unions serving the city. The Credit Unions Act 1979 for the first time regulated credit unions in the UK.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/34 The Act required that all credit unions in Scotland, Wales and England register with the Registrar of Friendly Societies, who was responsible for ensuring that credit unions had a \\"satisfactory\\" common bond and adhered to common set of rules. The registrar was tasked with monitoring the activities of credit unions, who had to submit quarterly and annual returns to the registrar. The Act allowed the registrar to suspend a credit union's operations, strike credit unions off the registry and prosecute illegal financial activity by a credit union. In the years immediately following the passing of the Act, the number of credit unions increased significantly. In 1982, 73 credit unions were registered. From the late 1980s to early 1990s the registration of credit unions surged, increasing fourfold between 1987 and 1994. Between 1994 and 2000 a large number of small credit unions closed or merged with other credit unions. In 2000, 660 credit unions were regarded officially registered. A further 220 credit unions had failed to submitted their annual return to the Registrar. In 1980, the first credit union was registered in Wales. The St Therese's Credit Union served the Catholic community living on a housing estate in Port Talbot. In the 1990s membership of credit unions in Wales grew as credit unions helped to deliver anti-poverty and financial inclusion policies in cooperation with local authorities and national charities. By 1997, 31 credit unions were registered in Wales. Following mergers between smaller credit unions the number of registered credit unions in Wales reduced to 26 by 2010. Between them the 26 credit unions achieve all-Wales coverage. According to Bank of England figures, the number of credit union members in Britain nearly doubled from 562,000 in 2004 to almost 1.04 million in 2012, while total assets increased from ¬£432m to ¬£956m. However, the number of active credit unions in Britain fell from 565 in 2004 to 390 in 2012. Some merged with rivals but others ceased trading, at least fourteen of them between January 2012 and July 2013.  Regulation and policy  Credit unions in the United Kingdom have been regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority for prudential purposes and the Financial Conduct Authority for conduct purposes since 1 April 2013, previously regulated by the Financial Services Authority from July 2002.ABCUL . Retrieved 2008-10-17. Before the Credit Unions Act 1979 was passed, there was no special legal structure for credit unions in the UK. Some of the early credit unions chose to register under the Companies Act and some under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act. They are classified in two types: type 1 are the smaller credit unions while type 2 are larger. From November 2006, many type 2 credit unions began offering their members debit card accounts so that they could withdraw cash from any Link ATM. In June 2008, the Treasury announced plans to encourage the growth of credit unions by broadening the common bond and removing outdated restrictions, with the intention of significantly reducing the influence of door step lenders and loan sharks.\\"Credit union rules 'to be eased. BBC News. 30 June 2008. Amendments to the Credit Unions Act 1979 were made by the Legislative Reform (Industrial and Provident Societies and Credit Unions) Order 2011 (SI 2011/2687),http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/2687/contents/made which came into force on 8 January 2012. The main changes were the removal of restrictions of membership to reach out to new groups by serving more than one group of people, provide services to community groups, businesses and social enterprises with specific business loans and to offer interest on savings, instead of a dividend, in line with mainstream banking. Regulations for credit unions place a maximum interest rate on loans of 3% per month.  Security of savings  Since October 2008 UK credit unions are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), which protects savings in banks and similar institutions up to ¬£85,000 (), covering about 98% of people; most members get their money back within a week. Credit unions offer savers considerably more protection than commercial \\"savings clubs\\", as was demonstrated by the 2006 collapse of the Christmas hamper club Farepak.  Recent changes in credit unions  In Britain the number of active credit unions fell from 565 in 2004 to 390 in 2012; some merged, but others became insolvent. Six ceased trading in 2012, and at least eight had ceased in 2013 by the end of July. However, the number of members has increased from 1.04 million in 2012 to 2 million in 2018. Many credit unions are actively engaged in battling high interest payday loan organisations and loan sharks, offering an affordable credit alternative. In 2013 the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby launched a Church of England plan to support credit unions, to combat the rise of UK payday lenders charging extremely high interest rates, which gave rise to much publicity.

The episode was written by series creator Theresa Rebeck and was directed by Michael Mayer. The show revolves around a group of characters who come together to put on a Broadway musical based on the life of Marilyn Monroe. The episode featured a mix of original songs and cover songs, the former being written by series composers Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman. In the episode, world-renowned songwriting duo Julia Houston (Debra Messing) and Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) are inspired to create a new Broadway musical on the life of Marilyn Monroe‚Äîinstantly attracting the attention of tenacious producer Eileen Rand (Anjelica Huston) and brilliant yet temperamental director Derek Wills (Jack Davenport). As the four search for their leading lady, veteran actress Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) becomes obsessed with winning them over and native Iowan waitress Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee) becomes desperate to make her theatrical dreams a reality. The series received a large amount of promotion before its premiere and several ads were put into the commercial breaks for Super Bowl XLVI which aired on NBC. The episode was also released online before its original American broadcast. The episode was viewed by an estimated 11.44 million viewers and received a 3.8 rating/10 share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, making it the highest-rated NBC drama series premiere in four years and the third highest new drama debut of the 2011‚Äì12 television season. Despite this, viewership between the first and second half-hour dropped, significantly. The episode received positive reviews from critics and was named among the best pilots of the aforesaid television season. Plot Noted songwriting duo Julia Houston (Debra Messing) and Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) get inspiration for a new Broadway show after Tom's personal assistant Ellis Tancharoen (Jaime Cepero) reveals his love for Marilyn Monroe. The two decide to cut a demo with Broadway veteran Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) which Ellis videotapes. He sends the tape to his mother who uploads it online. Julia and Tom grow angry towards this, fearing that theater critic Michael Riedel will write a harsh review of the song. They decide to fire Ellis, until they learn Riedel loved the song and approved of the idea of a Marilyn Monroe musical. They rehire Ellis and they quickly receive interest from producer Eileen Rand (Anjelica Huston), who brings on director Derek Wills (Jack Davenport), who had a strained relationship with Tom. Derek demands to audition for the main role while Tom wants Ivy to play Marilyn. Meanwhile, a waitress named Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee), who came from a small town in Iowa to make her theatrical dreams a reality hears the original demo song and decides to audition. Karen makes a good impression on the producers, leading to both Karen and Ivy getting a callback. Later on, Derek calls Karen to have a meeting at his loft late at night. At Derek's loft, he tells Karen he needs to see \\"everything you've got,\\" a come-on that momentarily panics Karen. Derek accuses her of playing the innocent and pretending not to know why she was invited to the director's loft in the middle of the night. She retreats to the bathroom and gathers her nerves. When she comes back, she is in nothing but his shirt and, singing \\"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\\" as Marilyn, she climbs into his lap, straddling him, then pulls away and says \\"not gonna happen\\". The next day, Karen and Ivy go to their callback singing \\"Let Me Be Your Star\\", which closes out the episode. Production Conception and writing Development began in 2009 at Showtime by then-Showtime entertainment president Robert Greenblatt and Steven Spielberg, from an idea by Spielberg, who had been working on the concept for years. The original concept was that each season would follow the production of a new musical, if any of them were \\"stage-worthy\\", Spielberg would make them into an actual Broadway musical. The series was mainly inspired by The West Wing and Upstairs, Downstairs. Spielberg hired Theresa Rebeck to create the series after watching her play, \\"The Understudy\\" and receiving a recommendation from executive producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron. Before the series could be produced, Greenblatt was named chairman of NBC Entertainment after Comcast took control of newly rechristened NBCUniversal. Greenblatt brought the series with him and NBC ordered production of a pilot in January 2011 for the 2011‚Äì12 television season. The pilot reportedly cost $7.5 million to produce. The series was then picked up for the first season on May 11, 2011 for 15 episodes. The pilot episode was written by series creator Theresa Rebeck. She joined the series when it was initially going to be on Showtime. Due to the change in networks, 20 minutes worth of material was taken from the pilot and put into the following episodes, due to the timeslot. Also, the language and explicitness of the show was toned down. While initially coming up with characters, she decided to give some characters two jobs on the musical, for example Derek Wills is both the director and choreographer. This was done in order \\"to keep the creative team from sprawling\\" and in order to gain a larger audience. Despite this, she also said she wasn't forced to make the series any more \\"mainstream\\". Casting Smash marks Anjelica Huston's first regular television role. The first cast onto the series was Debra Messing, with her role initially being the lead character, according to Deadline Hollywood. Smash marks the first regular television role for Anjelica Huston, who normally appears in films. She cited, in an interview with The Huffington Post, that the script, the cast and producers for the series were the reason she joined it, saying she'd \\"be a fool not to participate\\". Music The episode features both original and cover songs sung on-screen by the characters. The original songs were written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman. Executive producers Zadan and Meron immediately suggested the two composers to the series after signing onto the series. The pilot episode features three original songs (\\"Never Give All the Heart\\", \\"The National Pastime\\", and \\"Let Me Be Your Star\\"), and a cover of Christina Aguilera's \\"Beautiful\\", the choice for the latter being used to extend the show's brand to iTunes. Three singles were released from the episode: \\"Beautiful\\" sung by McPhee, \\"The National Pastime\\" sung by Hilty, and \\"Let Me Be Your Star\\" sung by McPhee and Hilty. Release Pre-broadcast feedback and marketing Before the series had premiered, some media critics stated that the series had potential to become a ratings hit and possibly raise NBC from being the fourth highest-rated network out of five. Greenblatt has also stated that he has high hopes for the series. In order to make it more likely the series will be a success, NBC picked the series up for 15 episodes and opted to hold the show for mid-season in order to pair it up with the hit reality show The Voice on Monday nights. Despite this, other media critics have said unless the series receives a rating above a 3.0 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, it will be considered a failure, and only two other NBC series ranked above a 3.0 rating at the time; Fear Factor and The Office. The series has also been put on Monday nights against CBS, with Monday featuring Two and a Half Men, one of the highest-rated shows of the season. Also, musical shows have a known record for failures, like Cop Rock. NBC used several forms of advertising to promote the series, airing several promos on sister channels like E! and Bravo. There were also several ads for the series during Super Bowl XLVI, which aired on NBC. Due to the already positive buzz surrounding the show, NBC offered early viewings of the pilot on different platforms. For example, from January 15 through January 30, 2012, it was screened on select flights of American Airlines. Also, from January 23 to February 6, 2012, it was also streamed online at NBC.com and hulu. The marketing price has been put as high as $22 million, although NBC Entertainment marking president Len Fogge has denied this, saying it cost less than $10 million. Ratings The pilot episode originally aired on NBC in the United States on February 6, 2012. The episode was seen by 11.44 million viewers and received a 3.8 rating/10 share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 3.8% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 10% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. It initially began with a 4.2 rating, but dropped to a 3.4 rating in the second half-hour. Despite the drop in ratings, the episode ranked first in its timeslot, defeating the CBS police procedural drama, Hawaii Five-0 and the ABC comedy-drama television series, Castle. The episode also ranked as the highest-rated drama series premiere for NBC since Life. It was also the third- highest-rated new drama debut of the 2011‚Äì2012 television season, behind Once Upon a Time and Touch, and delivered the biggest 10 p.m. rating of any drama in this television season. The program also had the highest 18-49 rating and viewership for an NBC series in the time-slot since November 2008. \\"Pilot\\" was the twelfth most-watched scripted show for the week of broadcast among adults aged 18‚Äì49 and seventeenth among overall viewers. Reviews The pilot episode has received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 of reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 79 based on 32 reviews. In June 2011, Smash was one of eight honorees in the \\"Most Exciting New Series\\" category at the Critics' Choice Television Awards, voted by journalists who had seen the pilots. Matt Mitovich of TVLine called the cast \\"pretty damn perfect\\" and complimented the musical numbers. Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times called the show a \\"triumph\\" and also went on to say that the creator Theresa Rebeck as well as her team, \\"have managed to capture the grand and sweeping gesture that is musical theater and inject it with the immediate intimacy of television\\". In the Chicago Tribune she also compared the episode to Glee and A Chorus Line. Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post called it one of the strongest new shows of the season. Another Huffington Post writer Karen Ocamb praised the writing and the creativity of the series. She also complemented the New York City setting of the series saying \\"you feel as if you're walking down noisy and beloved Times Square with the characters.\\" Tim Goodman from The Hollywood Reporter called the episode an \\"Excellent, a bar- raiser for broadcast networks\\" and called it superior to Glee. He also praised writing and acting for the series, comparing it to the quality of a cable television series. HitFix reviewer Alan Sepinwall complemented the series for its cast and music, but said that he didn't understand the hype towards the series. He also criticized the battle for the main-role of Marilyn for the musical, writing, \\"the show keeps trying to position Karen and Ivy as equally- deserving of the part, when Hilty very thoroughly outclasses McPhee whenever the production numbers start.\\" Despite this, he called the pilot, \\"smart and slick\\", and that he would keep on watching future episodes. He ultimately gave the episode a B. In a podcast with Sepinwall and fellow HitFix writer Dan Feinberg, the two were very negative towards Jaime Cepero's performance as Ellis Tancharoen, with Sepinwall comparing it to a failed version of \\"All About Eve\\". They also criticized the writing for Messing's character, Julia Houston and Hilty's character, Ivy Lynn. Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker praised Messing's performance calling her \\"funny and charming\\" and a dialed down version of her Will and Grace character Grace Adler. He later went on to criticize the storyline between McPhee and Hilty, believing that Hilty was \\"obviously superior\\" to McPhee and that the storyline felt \\"strained\\". He also went on to write that he hoped the series became a ratings success. Tanner Stransky, also of Entertainment Weekly, ranked the pilot episode as the 8th best television episode of 2012 saying, \\"After we watched the subsequent 14 episodes of Smash with a mixture of fascination and dismay (seriously, did Debra Messing's Julia wear a men's pajama top to meet her lover?), it was difficult to recall that the pilot was positively magical. But it was. In fact, that episode-ending performance of Let Me Be Your Star (featuring dueling divas Megan Hilty and Katharine McPhee) was among TV's most watchable and gleeful three minutes of the year. Rare is the series whose high-water mark is its pilot, and Smash is a shining example.\\" David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the program a rave review and saying that, \\"[It's so] good you can't help wondering why no one thought of it before, a compelling mix of credible real-life melodrama with a fictionalized approximation of what it takes to get a Broadway show from the idea stage to opening night. Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that \\"Unless you're allergic to musicals in general and Broadway in particular, you should find that a compelling central story, a strong cast, an out-of-the-procedural-mold premise and some rousing, roof- raising numbers more than compensate for any lingering problems.\\" He ultimately gave it three and a half stars out of four. The A.V. Club reviewer Noel Murray praised the cast and Eileen's divorce storyline. He mainly criticized the staging and arrangement of the musical numbers saying they threatened the realism of the show and wrote they weren't completely \\"digetic\\". He ultimately gave the episode a B. Another A.V. Club reviewer Emily VanDerWerff criticized the series for not avoiding clich√©s but also wrote \\"the show is so damned sincere about how much it embraces the clich√©s of the backstage Broadway story that those inclined to like this sort of thing‚Äîand I'm very much one of them‚Äîwill forgive it some of these excesses.\\" She also criticized the adoption storyline. Despite this, he went on to compare the series to Hill Street Blues, ER and The West Wing. Accolades Smash won a 2012 Primetime Emmy Award for Josh Bergasse for choreography. The choreography for \\"The National Pastime\\" song in this episode was one of the routines that were part of the show's submission in the Choreography category.Primetime Emmy Awards 2012: Choreography category References External links *Pilot at Internet Movie Database *Pilot at TV.com Category:Smash (TV series) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes Smash ","title":"Pilot (Smash)"},{"id":"34401640","text":"Gilavand (, also Romanized as Gƒ´lƒÅvand) is a village in Azna Rural District, in the Central District of Khorramabad County, Lorestan Province, Iran.

It was built in 1847, and remodeled in 1909-1910. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Architecture The house is a 2 1/2-story, brick Classical Revival style building on a sandstone foundation. It was originally built in the Greek Revival style. The front facade features a full 2 1/2-story, pedimented portico supported by Ionic order columns which was added during the 1909 remodeling. The exterior surface of polychrome Flemish bond brick was also added at this time. Immediately north of the house is Memorial Park - formerly known as the Public Square, which has a Civil War monument and a modern gazebo. Immediately north of the park is the Clarion County Courthouse. Most buildings in the neighborhood were originally residences, but have been converted to commercial uses. Note: This includes History Thomas Sutton, Jr. (1815-1853) was a lawyer from Indiana County, Pennsylvania, who move to Clarion about 1846 with his new wife Anne. He built a small brick law office on the property a block south of the courthouse and then the house on the same lot. The law office has since been destroyed. He died six years after the house was built, and his widow lived in the house until 1862, when she sold it for $2,000 to William J. Reynolds. Other owners included C.C. Brosius (1872‚Äì74), Nathan Meyers (1874-92), his widow Sue Meyers (1892-1907), and John Reed (1907-1908). John Ditz, a hardware merchant, bought the house in 1908 for $7,000 and remodeled it. Ditz's hardware business was successful but he lost money in the Florida land boom of the 1920s, and converted the house into \\"tourist rooms\\" in the 1930s while still living there. After his death in 1941, his wife Minnie owned the house and lived in it until her death in 1972 at age 92. The Clarion County Historical Society bought the house in 1975 and it now houses the Society's museum.

History   Medieval era  The construction of the castle dates back to 1170 by order of the first King of Portugal Afonso Henriques (1112‚Äì1185). He granted a Foral charter to the town at the same time, encouraging the development of the town. Afonso III (1248‚Äì1279) granted to the village in 1258 a second Foral Charter, promising privileges to the town. In 1361 the traffic between Portugal and Galicia was required to pass through Melga√ßo demonstrating its importance at the time. In the context of the 1383-1385 Portuguese succession crisis, the village and its castle followed the northern region of Portugal by expressing loyalty to Beatriz. It fell into Spanish hands but in early 1387, then governed by a Spanish mayor, the town suffered the harassment of the Portuguese troops under the command of John I (1385‚Äì1433), resisting their take over for nearly two months. In 1492, Melga√ßo was one of only five places along the Spanish- Portuguese border where the Sephardic Jews expelled from Spain could enter Portugal. Still under the reign of King Manuel I, village defenses and its castle layout are figured in the Duarte de Armas (Book of Fortresses, c. 1509), made up of three towers and two gates.  Present day  It is classified as a National Monument by decree published on June 23, 1910, and the wall of the village been classified in the same way, with publication on February 19, 1926. The intervention of the government, however, only came to be felt in the 1960s, keeping the construction characteristics of the set. Recently, with the development of the village's historic core recovery projects, the keep of the castle was reclassified as a museum center, exposing the testimonies obtained by archaeological research.  Architecture  The castle has plant in circular shape, unusual in the country, divided into three precincts. The walls, where they tear two doors are surmounted by prismatic battlements and reinforced by three towers, the main one being that is focused on the urban core, pentagonal section. The set is dominated by the keep. The keep has a square shaped plan, isolated in the center of the parade ground. Both she and the surrounding wall were fully rebuilt, inferring to its Romanesque feature only the design of this set: a solid square tower isolated in the center of the walled enclosure. The tower is divided internally into three floors, illuminated by some chinks. The crown is made by a shot in counter with battlements, now reclassified as lookout of the archaeological museum established in the tower dependencies. Regarding the doors, they are two: the main gate to the west, larger, go to the square of weapons, which opens a cistern, where he would find the commander's residence; and the betrayal door to the north, smaller. They remain part of the Barbican on the main door and towers that flanked one of the doors of the fence. Thanks to recent archaeological research, which laid bare significant stretches of gothic fence, we can now make the idea of the original design.

These problems include abandoned calls, initial call delays, government regular, consumer dissatisfaction, and host of other problems. Unlike other types of dialers, natural predictive dialers insert agents before the automation component of the dialer (such as call progress analysis) has completed. For example, a standard predictive dialer will (1) first determine if a live person has answered the phone call and then (2) transfer that call to an agent that is deemed to be available to take the call. Conversely, natural predictive dialers connect the agent prior to the completion of the automation process, which allows the agent to hear the called party say \\"hello\\" while the automation is still working. At its core, natural predictive dialing technologies are based on the concept that call automation should work with agents, instead of call automation working before agents are connected, and then agents being connected to calls that have been determined to be 'live' people. In natural predictive dialing the call automation (sometimes called Call Progress Analysis (CPA)) can work before during or after an agent has interfaced with a call. This interweaving of automation and human agents provides productivity increases traditionally associated with automation technologies, while working to eliminate the unnatural affect that many call automation technologies have on the human-interaction aspects of the call.  Benefits  The core benefit of natural predictive dialing is the more pleasant human interactions that occur during calls that are actually being made by an automated system connected to agents. In natural predictive dialing, the agents hear the called party say \\"hello\\" and can respond accordingly. The technology works well on small and large scales (one user up to thousands). Contact centers that require a natural calling experience and wish to also have the productivity benefits associated with predictive dialing can utilize this technology to obtain both benefits.  Drawbacks  The only commercially available natural predictive dialer is provided by a single vendor. Additionally, patents protecting the technology make it more expensive than many other systems, such as those available for free based on the Asterisk platform. Many contact centers and other organizations don't necessarily need the benefits associated with the natural predictive dialing technology and can save money by using a more inexpensive or less-proprietary system.

It originally aired on Showtime on October 30, 2011. The lone survivor of the al-Qaeda group that held Brody for eight years is captured. Saul and Carrie are to interrogate him, with Brody's help. Plot Carrie (Claire Danes) visits her father, Frank (James Rebhorn), with the intent of pilfering some of his pills (he also has bipolar disorder). She manages to get some, but her visit is cut short when she gets a call telling her that the CIA has Afsal Hamid (Waleed Zuaiter) in custody, who was the lone survivor of the raid where Brody (Damian Lewis) was rescued in Iraq. Meanwhile, Saul (Mandy Patinkin) is at the airport, picking up his wife Mira (Sarita Choudhury) as she returns from India. Saul similarly gets a call about the captured terrorist and has to leave immediately, not even able to take Mira home. Carrie and Saul arrive for an interrogation of Hamid. Sgt. Brody has also been summoned. Brody recognizes Hamid as his guard when he was in captivity. Flashbacks are shown of Hamid severely beating Brody and then urinating on him. Saul conducts the interrogation alone in the room with Hamid, while Brody and Carrie watch on camera and are able to talk to Saul via an earpiece. As the interrogation progresses, Brody feeds Saul details of his captivity, so that Saul appears all-knowing. Saul then offers to protect Hamid's family from Abu Nazir, if he is willing to talk. Hamid is then left in the interrogation room with the lights blinking, the air conditioning on full, and intermittent blasts of loud metal music are played. After many hours of this treatment, Hamid is seemingly ready to cooperate. He says he does not know much, but gives up an e-mail address to which he once passed along a message. The address is eventually traced back to the university where the previously investigated Raqim Faisel is working. A short time later, Raqim's home address is ascertained. Brody meets with Estes (David Harewood) and makes a plea to have a face-to-face with Hamid. He argues that he has earned the right to confront his torturer, and that he needs to put that chapter of his life behind him. Estes knows such a thing should not be permitted, but ever the careerist, he is persuaded. With guards present in the room, Brody sits across a table from Hamid who is having a meal. After some taunting by Brody, Hamid spits in his face. Brody grabs Hamid out of his chair and wrestles him to the floor. The altercation is quickly broken up. Brody goes home to find that he missed Chris' (Jackson Pace) karate match, but Mike (Diego Klattenhoff) was able to give Chris a ride. After a tense confrontation with Mike, Brody later goes into Chris' room to find him praying. Chris says that for eight years, he and the family prayed for Brody to still be alive. Now, they pray that he is going to be okay. Saul calls Carrie to inform her that Hamid is dead. He had somehow obtained a fragment of a razor blade and slashed his own wrist. Carrie, along with a team of agents, raid Raqim and Aileen's house but it is now empty. Carrie initially suspects a tip-off from within the CIA, especially with Hamid also mysteriously ending up dead. Saul is home with Mira, who is at the end of her rope. She says she is tired of her life revolving around Saul and his all-consuming work. As this conversation is going on, Carrie shows up. She has learned of Brody's meeting with Hamid and has a tape of the camera footage with her. She is furious that Brody was allowed to have contact with Hamid, and points out that in the melee, Brody pulled Hamid into the blind spot of the camera, giving him ample opportunity to pass Hamid the blade. Saul is also angry that Brody was permitted to meet with Hamid, but refuses to take Carrie's suspicions up the chain of command, as there is still no hard evidence. Carrie says she will take it up with Estes, whether Saul approves or not. Saul counters that if she does so, she will be fired. Carrie storms out after a nasty argument. Carrie goes to Langley and cleans out her office. She then shows up at her sister Maggie's (Amy Hargreaves) house, now an emotional wreck. In tears, she tells Maggie \\"I think I just quit my job.\\" She complains about now having nobody's support, not even Saul's. The episode ends with Carrie unable to sleep and contemplating her future. Production Co-executive producer Alexander Cary wrote the episode, his second of three writing credits for the first season. It was directed by Clark Johnson, his first of the two episodes he directed for the first season. Reception Ratings The original broadcast had 1.28 million viewers, which was an increase of 180,000 viewers over the previous episode. Reviews Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V.

Forty-five short films and two feature-length films were produced featuring Eille Norwood in the role of Holmes and Hubert Willis cast as Dr. Watson with the exception of the final film, The Sign of Four, where Willis was replaced with Arthur Cullin. Consequently, Norwood holds the record for most appearances as Sherlock Holmes in film. Production Sir Oswald Stoll, an Australian-born Irish theatre manager ran music halls and West End stages until World War I when he segued into film production. Beginning in 1919, Stoll opened a series of cinemas and purchased a disused aircraft factory to create the then-largest film studio in Britain. In 1920, Stoll purchased the rights to produce films based on Sherlock Holmes' tales from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Stoll embarked on the production of his first series of fifteen short films entitled The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes in 1921. The films were directed by Maurice Elvey and then 59-year-old actor Eille Norwood was chosen to portray Sherlock Holmes, with Hubert Willis cast as Dr Watson. Norwood was obsessed with portraying Holmes true to the written stories. He re-read all the stories published up to that time and even learned to play the violin. Norwood had a reputation as a very professional actor with an incredible ability with make- up and disguise. There is a story that when Elvey asked Norwood to do an impromptu screen test, Norwood excused himself to the dressing room and appeared a few minutes later \\"an entirely new person\\". Norwood took pains to maintain faithfulness to the original stories, something Conan Doyle was so impressed with he awarded the actor a gift of a dressing gown which the actor wore in many of the films. However, Conan Doyle was critical of the choice to set the stories in modern times. The initial series of fifteen shorts entitled The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes was so successful, that Stoll moved to film a feature-length adaptation of The Hound of the Baskervilles also in 1921. Unlike Adventures, The Hound of the Baskervilles was less faithful to the original story. While film critics such as The New York Times were less than enthused with the adaptation, Doyle enjoyed it claiming \\"On seeing him [Eille Norwood] in The Hound of the Baskervilles I thought I had never seen anything more masterly.\\" Critical success returned with the second installment of fifteen short films entitled The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes in 1922. Elvey was replaced as director by George Ridgwell. A final collection of fifteen shorts was released in 1923 entitled The Last Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The series was successful enough to spawn one last feature-length film, The Sign of Four released later in 1923. The Sign of Four featured a return of Elvey to the helm and the replacement of Hubert Willis with Arthur Cullin as Watson. Elvey considered Willis too old to play a romantic interest for Mary Morstan. Cullin had earlier assayed the role in 1916's The Valley of Fear opposite H. A. Sainstbury's Holmes.

Steel engraving from a drawing by Henry Gastineau. Gastineau joined the Society of Painters in Water-colours in 1818, when he exhibited for the first time. In 1821 he was elected an associate, and in 1823 a full member. He exhibited for 58 years without a break, showing eleven pictures when eighty-five years of age. A contemporary of David Cox, Copley Fielding, George Cattermole, and Samuel Prout, he kept to the old manner of water-colour painting. Gastineau also devoted a great deal of his time to teaching, both privately and at various schools. Early in life he built for himself a house, Norfolk Lodge, in Cold Harbour Lane, Camberwell, and lived there until his death on 17 January 1876 in his eighty-sixth year. He was then the oldest living member of the Old Society of Painters in Water-colours. He left a family, one of whom, Maria Gastineau, was also a water-colour painter. Like Cox, Cattermole and Prout, he was buried at West Norwood Cemetery. Gastineau's unsold works were auctioned at Christie's on 19 May 1876.

In the 1970s Strozzi-Heckler and Robert K. Hall, M.D. developed The Lomi School of body oriented psychotherapy, influenced by the work of Fritz Perls, Ida Rolf, Randolph Stone, and Charan Singh. In addition to the usual psychiatric and psychoanalytic methods, this program includes touch, group process, breathwork, attention training, and movement to its approach,Johnson, D., Groundworks: Narratives of Embodiment. North Atlantic (1997) p. 116 https://books.google.com/books?id=pRnAGCOBxFEC to provide its framework for working with the mind unified with the physical body.Davidson, A., Davis, V., Body Brilliance: Mastering Your Five Vital Intelligences Elite Books (2010) p. 70, 220 In 1985 Strozzi-Heckler contributed to a pilot program for the U.S. Army Special Forces to evaluate mind-body approaches to military training. In addition to many of the measured outcomes related to increased endurance, alertness, capacity for stress management, and team cohesion, participants unexpectedly demonstrated significant increases in leadership characteristics. Reflecting on this, Strozzi-Heckler began exploring ways to adapt the program for leaders in business and government. In collaboration with Fernando Flores during the 1980s and 1990s, Flores's Ontology of Language research into speech acts was integrated and applied to the somatic leadership domain. Wildflower, L., \\"The Hidden History of Coaching\\" McGraw-Hill Education (2013) p.66 https://books.google.com/books?id=IKGSyKsY-hkC In 2000, Strozzi Institute introduced a training program for coaches interested in their somatic approach. Strozzi Somatics The Strozzi Institute methodology, known as Strozzi Somatics, is used one-on-one and in groups of varying size. The Strozzi Somatics methodology makes a distinction between soma - the living body in its entirety, and the mechanistic view of the physical body as an assemblage of anatomical parts. Using this first definition the body is regarded as the primary domain of feeling, action, language, and meaning.Strean, W.B., Strozzi-Heckler, R., \\"(The) Body (of) Knowledge: Somatic Contributions to the Practice of Sport Psychology\\" Journal of Sports Psychology, September 2009 p. 93 From this perspective, coaches observe the ways people hold their bodies and how they respond to stress situations, such as verbal or physical surprises. The body‚Äôs overall organization in this way is referred to as a somatic shape.Keleman, S., Emotional Anatomy. Center Press (1985) p.103 Each person‚Äôs unique somatic shape is formed by responses to past experiences, positive and negative, which are established as deep, mostly unconscious patterns of muscular activity in the body. Over time these patterns produce conditioned tendencies of reaction to people, situations and environments. Strozzi-Heckler has described the process in which, when an individual is exposed to a stressful stimulus, they revert to this conditioned tendency, limiting their available choices for action.Strozzi-Heckler, R., Anatomy of Change: A Way to Move Through Life's Transitions. North Atlantic Books (1997) p. 25 Withdrawal, fear, attempting to dominate, rigidity, and over-accommodation are examples of different conditioned tendency shapes. Because this is a somatic event rather than an exclusively cognitive one, new information or theoretical insight will not shift the response. As an illustration, he describes a team leader who has extensive education in management principles but, especially under stress, comports himself in a way that produces mistrust and resentment from the people he manages, eventually creating significant breakdowns within his team.Strozzi-Heckler, R., The Leadership Dojo. Frog Books (2007) pp. 27-32 Leadership  Strozzi Institute has stressed that leadership characteristics often considered innate are teachable, and can be improved with practice. These traits include: high self awareness and awareness of the environment, being open to possibilities rather than limited to past options, being motivated by a connection to what one cares about, the ability to deal directly with matters that need attention, directing attention outward in a way that enables listening and connection with others, and the ability to coordinate with others and empathize with their concerns. Interview with Strozzi-Heckler http://www.voiceamerica.com/episode/26740/the-body-of-leadership 6:50 - 11:48, 19:20 - 20:05 Aikido Influence Many of the practices taught are adapted from aikido and different forms of meditation. Aikido movements are presented in a non-martial context and principles of the art such as: centering oneself, facing an attack, extending outward into the environment, entering into shared space, and blending with the momentum of an incursion, are used as physical metaphors to guide the practice of embodying leadership characteristics. An aikido dojo, Two Rock Aikido, is located on the Strozzi Institute site in Sonoma. Strozzi Bodywork Working from the premise that the body and the self are indistinguishable from one another, Strozzi Institute offers training in a style of bodywork developed by Strozzi-Heckler and Hall to produce change in a person's core historical limitations. Strozzi Bodywork involves addressing deeply held muscular contractions (also known as armoring) maintained in the soma using touch, breath, and directed attention. Practitioners train to develop an empathetic, compassionate presence that can build trust and enable them to work with others through a variety of emotional states. Some somatic coaches use Strozzi Bodywork in their coaching sessions. Applications The Strozzi Somatics methodology has been applied to a broad range of organizations and with diverse populations. These include Fortune 50 companies, U.S. Navy SEALs, U.S. Marines, law enforcement agencies, social justice groups, professional sports teams, as well as urban gang members, prisoners, Olympic athletes, and survivors of sexual trauma.Haines, S., Healing Sex: A Mind-Body Approach to Healing Sexual Trauma Cleis (2007) Strozzi Institute has contributed to U.S. Military counter-insurgency training, integrating somatic practices to enhance soldiers' abilities to connect with others across cultures rather than rely predominantly on force. Strozzi-Heckler has said, \\"Working with the body gives you a way to do that because it transcends words and language. It takes us to that common core of being human.\\"Helgesen, S. ‚ÄúThe Dance of Power‚Äù Strategy+Business, Winter 2007/Issue 49, http://www.strategy-business.com/article/07406?gko=c0c2d Further reading *Strozzi-Heckler, R., The Leadership Dojo, Frog Books (2007) *Strozzi-Heckler, R., The Anatomy of Change, North Atlantic Books (1997) *Haines, S., Healing Sex: A Mind-Body Approach to Healing Sexual Trauma, Cleis (2007) *Leonard, G., Mastery: The Keys to Success and Long-Term Fulfillment, Penguin (1992) *Keleman, Stanley, Somatic Reality, Center Press (1982) References External links * Strozzi Institute website Category:Leadership studies Category:Personal development Category:Mind‚Äìbody interventions Category:Life coaches Category:Educational psychology Category:Petaluma, California Category:Somatic psychology ","title":"Strozzi Institute"},{"id":"34402193","text":"The Sage Type 4 was a prototype British floatplane of the First World War. It was a designed as a two-seat reconnaissance aircraft for the Royal Naval Air Service, but was chosen for service as a floatplane trainer, although the end of the war resulted in production being cancelled. Design and development In early 1917, the Peterborough based woodworking company of Frederick Sage & Company designed a two-seat patrol floatplane for the Royal Naval Air Service based on Sage's Type 3 landplane trainer. Like the Type 3, the new design, the Sage Type 4, was a single-engined biplane. Pilot and observer sat in separate tandem cockpits, with the pilot occupying the front cockpit, while the wireless operator/observer sat in the rear cockpit, with both crew members having good visibility. The aircraft was powered by a single 150 hp (112 kW) Hispano-Suiza 8 water-cooled V-8 engine in the nose driving a tractor propeller. Undercarriage consisted of two main floats under the wing the a further tail float.Uppendaun 2004, p. 69.Flight 24 July 1919, pp. 974‚Äì975. The prototype Sage Type 4a (serial number N.116Bruce 1957, p. 468.) first flew on 3 July 1917.Bruce 1957, p. 465. The type demonstrated excellent handing during testing, being capable both of flying aerobatic manoeuvres while still being stable enough to be easily flown \\"hands-off\\".Flight 24 July 1919, p. 975. Despite this, the type was rejected for service as a patrol aircraft, but it was recommended that it instead be adapted into a float-plane trainer. The aircraft was fitted with dual controls and the engine mounting was modified to allow any one of a variety of 200 hp (149 kW) engines to be fitted. N.116 was converted to the new standard, being fitted with a Sunbeam Arab and flew as the Sage Type 4b on 17 May 1918. Sage also designed a revised version, the Sage Type 4c with folding wings of increased wingspan (39 ft in (12.07 m) compared with 34 ft 6 in (10.52 m) for the earlier aircraft and powered by a 200 hp Hispano Suiza engine, with a prototype flying on 12 October 1918.Bruce 1957, p. 466. Both the Type 4b and 4c were adopted as standard training floatplanes for the RNAS, but the end of the First World War resulted in production plans being abandoned.

The church building, completed in 1878, is located on Broad Street in Downtown Columbus. History The cathedral c. 1900-10 St. Joseph Parish, named after Saint Joseph, Jesus' legal father, was founded by members of St. Patrick‚Äôs Parish in Columbus in 1866 to alleviate overcrowding. Its pastor, the Rev. Edward M. Fitzgerald, began to plan for the church, raised money, formed a building committee and secured property on Broad Street and Fifth for $13,500. The committee chose name St. Joseph for the new church, and selected Michael Harding as architect. Contractor John McCabe began construction June 6, 1866 with John Stoddard engaged as mason. Auxiliary Bishop Sylvester H. Rosecrans of Cincinnati laid the cornerstone November 11, 1866. In 1867, Father Fitzgerald became Bishop of Little Rock and Bishop Rosecrans succeeded him as pastor of St. Patrick‚Äôs. On March 3, 1868, Pope Pius IX established the Diocese of Columbus and named Bishop Rosecrans as its first bishop. He selected St. Joseph‚Äôs as the cathedral for the new diocese. Bishop Rosecrans named Robert T. Brookes to succeed Harding as architect and altered the original design of a brick structure to stone to befit its elevated status as a cathedral. Because of this, workers demolished the existing foundation walls rebuilt them deeper. Retired General William Rosecrans, older brother of Bishop Rosecrans, came to Columbus to assist with some of the design plans in the summer of 1870. Bishop Rosecrans celebrated the first Mass in the unfinished cathedral on Christmas 1872. Soon after, Cardinal John McCloskey of New York donated marble, from the same quarry used in the construction of St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, to construct a high altar and side altars. In 1873, parish purchased the home of Joseph Gundersheimer, across Broad Street between Sixth and Seventh Streets, to house the clergy. It served until the diocese could construct a rectory attached to the cathedral. Even though interior decoration of the building was incomplete, Bishop Rosecrans consecrated it on October 20, 1878. The final cost was $218,000. Tragically, the Bishop died the following day. He was interred directly beneath the main altar. Architecture Interior Pipe organ St. Joseph Cathedral was designed in the Gothic Revival style and built of ashlar stone quarried in Licking and Fairfield counties. The exterior dimensions of the building are with walls thick. The Broad Street (south) fa√ßade of the cathedral houses three entrances and was to be framed by two towers. The southwest tower was to rise to a height of and contain three clock faces and a chime of ten bells. while the southeast tower was to reach a height of . Both towers remain incomplete. The Fifth Street fa√ßade houses an additional entrance. In 1914, the diocese remodeled the cathedral replacing the main and side altars and communion rail. Work also included replacing the iron columns supporting the clearstory and new lighting. The cathedral saw further changes in 1967 when the lower level was excavated to create a usable meeting space. In June 1978, the sanctuary was updated in an attempt to incorporate changes mandated by the Second Vatican Council.

Which was built between 1904 and 1910 to commemorate the Centennial of the Independence of Mexico. Its machinery is identical to that of Big Ben in London. The Monumental Clock is the best known symbol and representative of the city. History Kiosk in front of the Clock. Clock at dawn. Background On January 20, 1901, musical group known as the Banda de Rurales provides its first performance in a wooden bandstand in the Plaza de las Diligencias (now Plaza Independencia), directed by Candelario Rivas. The band gained popularity in the context of popular glory, a group of British mining companies proposing the governor Francisco Valenzuela, build a majestic tower of concerts, entrepreneurs were led by Alfonso Mar√≠a Brito. The project was approved until 1904, when she began her construction, but had to be suspended a year later for lack of funds. In 1906, Governor Pedro L. Rodriguez returned the work, its design was by architect Tom√°s Cordero, and was built by engineers Francisco Hern√°ndez and Luis Carre√≥n. Construction Clock at sunset. Clock in the night. Francis Rule, a mining magnate originally from Cornwall, provided financing for the clock. Construction began in 1906 with contributions from mining companies established in the region, the total cost amounted to approximately 300 thousand pesos oro, used in its construction quarry of Tezoantla town located in the municipality of Mineral del Monte. The process used in the construction was tongue and groove based treatment technique that is quarried pierce each block with a cylindrical bore at the top and sculpt a kind of spike in the lower and the latter fits into the drilled without limestone use any material on the boards, 35 quarriers worked on the first stage and 29 in the second, among the latter Jacinto and Pedro Hern√°ndez Baldovino were charged with sculpting acroteria crowning the clock face. For the placement of carillon and copper dome, was requested to intervene and also alacateros of the mining company of San Rafael. Jes√∫s Zenil collaborator of the minister plenipotentiary of Mexico in Austria-Hungary, purchased the machinery for the clock in England and sent it to Pachuca. He went to the factory founded by Edward John Dent and there discussed the acquisition clock and carillon that has a sound like that of its twin installed on the Big Ben, the machinery came to Pachuca years before the end of the construction of the tower and the installation was done by Tom√°s Zepeda. The clock was kept first in the Capilla de la Asunci√≥n, and later in the Casa de Francisco Rule until being installed in the tower. The tower has open balconies, this was the place where the band would play, but it was a failed attempt as the height, the show could not be appreciated by people. The Banda de Rurales played at the kiosk attached to the tower again and finally ended the monument representing the Centennial of Mexican Independence. To complete the monument ordered a sheet of copper dome built in the Monterrey Iron Foundry Steel and opened in 1900. The piece was brought by rail and stood before the inauguration. Opening On September 15, 1910, shortly before 08:00 am, Alberto Dross, a German watchmaker verify the sound of bells and the accuracy of the hands of the four dials. At 12:00 pm, Gumersindo Mel√©ndez put the finishing touches to the lighting of the plaza; About seven o'clock in the evening the plaza was completely obscured, at 21:00 the Rurales body arrival behind them came the great brass band. At 21:15, Governor Ladislao Pedro Rodr√≠guez, accompanied by his wife, Virginia Hern√°ndez, and various authorities, he made his entry into the plaza where he presided over the ceremony, that began with an overture played by the Banda de Rurales then the lawyer Joaqu√≠n Gonz√°lez gave the official speech, an oratory on the meaning of Independence and the effort to build the great tower, which was followed by an interpretation of the band, immediately followed by the students in the public schools of Pachuca Hidalgo played the anthem again the Banda de Rurales executed a musical prelude to a poem by Miss Luz Conde, the band ended its involvement with the overture of the opera Tosca and closed the program with the poet Miguel Bracho his recitation of a poem. It took his first strokes at 23:00 pm that day. The governor on the ground floor, to hear the first ringing pulled the curtain that hid the marble plaque testified to that opening, then rose to the first plant, of the discovered balconies, where he gave the cry of independence and the Mexican National Anthem. Mr. Dross had arranged the machinery of the clock, so that for fifteen minutes, the ringing is constant, which is added the controlled explosion of dynamite charges that triggered mining companies in the hills surrounding the town, after the fires were which fireworks continued. During the early years, care of equipment and operation of the clock, was in charge of Mr. Alberto Dross.  Centennial  On September 15, 2010, the clock turned 100 years of being built.

Formerly widespread in central Italy, it came close to extinction in the late 20th century. In early 2012 the population was recovering and the breed was awaiting official recognition by the Federazione Italiana Associazioni Avicole, the federation of Italian poultry associations. History The Romagnola is a traditional rustic dual-purpose chicken breed. It was once widespread in central Italy, particularly in the provinces of Ravenna, Forl√¨-Cesena and Bologna in Emilia-Romagna. In the mid-20th century, selective breeding by the Stazione Sperimentale di Pollicoltura, or experimental chicken breeding centre, of Rovigo, in the Veneto, and the Ispettorato Provinciale dell'Agricoltura, or provincial inspectorate for agriculture, of Ravenna produced two well-defined colour varieties, a silver and a golden. Subsequently, the Romagnola declined, and was close to extinction when the provincial administration of the Province of Parma and the faculty of veterinary medicine of the University of Parma began a joint recovery programme. A breeders' association, the Associazione Razze e Variet√† Autoctone Romagnole, was formed in 2007 and a pilot production programme begun. In early 2012, the breed was awaiting recognition by the FIAV. Breed numbers remain low. A study published in 2007 used a figure of approximately 100 for the total breeding stock, of which approximately 30 were cocks. Characteristics The colour of the Romagnola is variable; the black-flecked silver and black-flecked golden colour varieties are most often seen. The skin is creamy white or pale yellow. The legs vary from yellow to very dark, which is preferred. The ear-lobes are creamy white, sometimes tinged with blue. The comb is single, with 5 or more points. Average weight is for cocks, for hens. The eggs are white and weigh about 60 g. Uses The Romagnola is a dual- purpose breed. Hens lay 150 eggs per year. Young birds are hardy and fast- growing; the meat is well-flavoured.
