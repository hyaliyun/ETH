History Built in 1739 on a land plot belonging to the former Voivodal Court (which was much larger than the present-day ruins of the Old Court‚Äî‚Äîshow), the inn belonged to the \\"Inner Town\\" (Romanian: T√¢rgul Dinl«éuntru), the inside section of Bucharest's Fortress. The inn was raised by Prince Constantin Mavrocordat, who decided to have a bezesten (the word is Turkish, meaning \\"large, square building, hosting shops all around, like in marketplaces\\"). These shops could only be rented by foreign merchants during the period they stayed in Bucharest doing business. The inn was also known during the 18th century as Hanul Bezesten (\\"Bezesten Inn\\"), because it resembles a Turkish bezesten, boasting large shades covering almost the whole street on the sides. Merchants from the famous crafts town of Gabrovo used to lodge at the inn when selling their products in the city. The inn was named after these merchants, as was the street on which it is located, a name that has survived into the 21st century. It was among the seven large inns in Bucharest that did not incorporate a church (the others being Manuc's Inn, Constantin Vod«é, Papazoglu, Golescu, Zamfir and Filipescu inns). During the 18th and 19th century, it burned several times, but it was always repaired and refurbished. The inn reached its glory between 1825 and 1850, when it ranked among the most important such settlements in the town. At the beginning of the 20th century, the inn was renamed as \\"Gabroveni-Universal Hotel\\", as Bucharest was changing from Oriental to French influence. The structure remained in use during the communist regime, and now hosts rooms for the students of the University of Bucharest. Other inns still standing in Bucharest include Manuc's Inn (Romanian: Hanul lui Manuc), the Lindentree Inn (almost universally referred to by its Romanian name Hanul cu Tei) and Solacoglu Inn (Romanian: Hanul Solacoglu or Hanul Solacolu).

R. Pai, was an Indian journalist and business consultant. Pai was born in Manjeshwar, Kerala, a small village on the Karnataka-Kerala Border. He studied at Canara High School, Mangalore and later at Presidency College, Madras where he obtained an MA in Political Science at the top of his class and received the Candeth Gold Medal from Madras University. Degree in Journalism After his studies he went to Bombay where he worked as an assistant editor with the Times of India. Two years later he went to the United States, where he obtained a Master's Degree in Journalism from the University of California, Los Angeles. During his stay in the US he had the opportunity of editing a newspaper at the Carlsbad Journal in a small town Carlsbad, California. Joins Forum of Free Enterprise He returned to India and joined the New India Assurance Company Limited for a short while until it was nationalised, and then joined the Forum of Free Enterprise, which was launched on 18 July 1956 by the late A D Shroff. In 1957, along with Nani Palkhivala, the Forum was developed into a national organisation which organised meetings on economic subjects across the country. Through the Forum he was responsible in corresponding with members of the Parliament of India, and other opinion leaders. He left the Forum in 1976 to become a business consultant. However, he continued to be its vice president till his death. In 2004, the All India Bank Depositors' Association, which he founded and headed, started the M. R. Pai Award. Meeting with Milton Friedman When Milton Friedman visited India in 1963, Pai was responsible for his meetings in India. The friendship generated during this visit lasted till Pai's death. When the Friedmans published their book Free to Choose in 1982, an autographed copy was sent to Pai, with an offer to publish any portion as a booklet. The Forum obliged them by bringing a booklet Central Economic Planning in September 1982.

It was during this time when the term Consumer Rights was yet to gain popularity, that Pai was able to make a big impact. Services offered by the Indian Telephones, Indian nationalised banks and Indian Airlines among others began to face his ire. He started demanding good services for the customer at every available forum.

The species was first described by Moritz Balthasar Borkhausen in 1792. It is distributed throughout Europe from Bulgaria up to the Caucasus in the south. In the north, it is found in southern Scotland, southern Sweden and Estonia through Europe to central Spain, southern Italy. The wingspan is 24‚Äì28 mm. This species is extremely similar to the marbled minor (Oligia strigilis) and the tawny marbled minor (Oligia latruncula) and specific identification usually requires close study of the genitalia. See Townsend et al.Martin C. Townsend, Jon Clifton and Brian Goodey, 2010 British and Irish Moths: An Illustrated Guide to Selected Difficult Species (covering the use of genitalia characters and other features) Butterfly Conservation pdf for genitalia images and an identification key.O. versicolor has a wingspan of 23‚Äì28 mm and often has more brightly coloured forewings than its congeners with rich reddish-brown tones and a grey subterminal band. There is also often one or more tufts of reddish hairs on the thorax, always lacking in its congeners. Although melanism occurs in this species it is much less frequent than in the other two species. O. versicolor flies at night in June and July and is attracted to light and sugar. It prefers moist areas. These include, for example, meadows, moors, wet heath and fen, woodland areas, sometimes sandy soils, but not strongly xerothermic habitats. The larva feeds internally on the stems of various grasses (including Carex species, Luzula luzoloides, Bracilypodium sylvaticum and Poa pratensis), pupating in a cocoon among the roots. This species overwinters as a larva. # The flight season refers to the British Isles. This may vary in other parts of the range. References *Skinner, Bernard (1984).

In February 2008, an extension of the agreement area came into force which changed the name to ‚ÄúAgreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas‚Äù. ASCOBANS covers all species of toothed whales (Odontoceti) in the Agreement Area, with the exception of the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus).  Background Numerous species of small cetaceans live in the Baltic, Irish and North Seas and the North East Atlantic, including dolphins, whales and harbour porpoises. The harbour porpoise is the most common small cetacean species in the North Sea and the only cetacean species native to the Baltic Sea and therefore is the flagship species of the Agreement. As migratory species, cetaceans face of a number of threats caused by human activities. These include habitat loss, marine pollution, acoustic disturbances from various sources and, most importantly, incidental catch by entanglement in fishing gear, so-called bycatch. Every year, thousands of whales, dolphins and porpoises fall victim to bycatch, drowning because they can no longer swim up to the surface for a breath of air. Organisational structure The Agreement has three main bodies that collaborate towards the implementation of ASCOBANS: Meeting of the Parties The Meeting of the Parties is the decision-making body of the Agreement. It meets every three years to assess progress and develop further steps in the implementation of ASCOBANS. Apart from the Member States, Non- Party Range States and relevant regional, intergovernmental and non- governmental organisations can attain observer status to attend MOP meetings without having a decision-making mandate themselves. Advisory Committee Each Party to the Agreement can nominate one member and a number of advisors to the Advisory Committee, which meets once a year. The role of the Committee is to provide scientific and policy advice to the Secretariat (see below) and the Meeting of the Parties. As with the MOP, external observers may take part in AC meetings, while the nominated members are the sole decision makers. Secretariat The ASCOBANS Secretariat, located in Bonn, acts as the coordinating body of the Agreement. It gathers and disseminates information to the MOP and the AC. It plays an important role in awareness-raising and provides advice and support to the Parties, assisting them in the implementation of the agreement. It services the sessions of the Meeting of the Parties and meetings of the Advisory Committee. The ASCOBANS Secretariat along with other Regional Agreement Secretariats within the framework of the Bonn Convention is integrated into the Agreements Unit of the CMS Secretariat. The 5th Meeting of the Parties of ASCOBANS (2006) decided that from 1 January 2007 the UNEP/CMS Secretariat would serve as the Secretariat for the ASCOBANS Agreement; and the Executive Secretary of UNEP/CMS would be the acting Executive Secretary of ASCOBANS. The current Acting Executive Secretary is Bradnee Chambers.  Species The most important species covered by the Agreement are: *harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) *bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) *common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) *white-beaked dolphin (Lagenorhynchus albirostris) *Atlantic white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus) *striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) *Risso‚Äôs dolphin (Grampus griseus) *killer whale (Orcinus orca) *long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas) *northern bottle-nosed whale (Hyperoodon ampullatus) and * other beaked whales (Ziphiidae).  Agreement area and member states ASCOBANS is open for accession by all Range States (i.e. any state that exercises jurisdiction over any part of the range of a species covered by the Agreement or whose flag vessels engage in operations adversely affecting small cetaceans in the Agreement area) and by regional economic integration organisations. Originally only covering the North and Baltic Sea, as of 3 February 2008 the ASCOBANS Area has been extended to include also the Irish Sea and parts of the North Eastern Atlantic. It is defined as follows: \\"‚Ä¶ the marine environment of the Baltic and North Seas and contiguous area of the North East Atlantic, as delimited by the shores of the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland; to the south-east by latitude 36¬∞N, where this line of latitude meets the line joining the lighthouses of Cape St. Vincent (Portugal) and Casablanca (Morocco); to the south-west by latitude 36¬∞N and longitude 15¬∞W; to the north-west by longitude 15¬∞W and a line drawn through the following points: latitude 59¬∞N/longitude 15¬∞W, latitude 60¬∞N/longitude 5¬∞W, latitude 61¬∞N/longitude 4¬∞W; latitude 62¬∞N/ longitude 3¬∞W; to the north by latitude 62¬∞N; and including the Kattegat and the Sound and Belt passages.\\" Parties      The European Union signed the Agreement, but never ratified it. Non-party range states    * Harbour porpoise conservation Three action plans for harbour porpoises specific to the situation in different parts of the Agreement Area have been concluded to date. * Jastarnia Plan, a Recovery Plan for Baltic Harbour Porpoises (2009) * Conservation Plan for Harbour Porpoises in the North Sea (2009) * Conservation Plan for the Harbour Porpoise Population in the Western Baltic, the Belt Sea and the Kattegat (2012) Public reception Over the years, the Agreement has appeared in a number of newspapers, both national and international. Attention has been drawn to ASCOBANS activities, successes and setbacks. While the WWF praised ASCOBANS‚Äô efforts towards bycatch reduction in 2001, it voiced criticism in 2004 claiming that gaping loopholes in ASCOBANS agreements permit the continued unnecessary killing of small cetaceans by fishermen, and that stronger measures would reduce mammalian bycatch. Meanwhile, in 2005, the TAZ presented the crucial role ASCOBANS plays in the protection of harbour porpoises in the Baltic Sea ‚Äì pointing out the successful introduction of a regulation that by 2007 all fishing vessels be equipped with pingers to warn porpoises and hence avert bycatch. In a more recent statement, the Gesellschaft zum Schutz der Meeress√§ugetiere, GSM, has called for increased attention to the work of ASCOBANS on the wider scale. Some NGOs have voiced concern about possible effects of the changed Secretariat arrangements since January 2007, which they see as weakening the capacity of this body of the Agreement. Since 2003, the International Day of the Baltic Harbour Porpoise, which is observed each year on the 3rd Sunday in May in institutions throughout the Baltic riparian states, has spread awareness of the plight of the harbour porpoise. The ASCOBANS Secretariat publishes a periodic newsletter, which informs about latest activities. Subscriptions are possible via the ASCOBANS website. ASCOBANS was a partner to the Year of the Dolphin.

It had limited commercial and critical success. The film features the fictional Scottish football club Kilnockie FC, based on a Second Division Scottish Football League club, as they attempt to reach their first ever Scottish Cup Final. The final game is against Rangers. Plot Robert Duvall plays the club manager, Gordon McLeod. Jackie McQuillan (Ally McCoist) is the team's striker, an ageing player on the verge of retirement, who has recently been signed from Arsenal. McQuillan is a legendary ex-Celtic player who, as well as being married to McLeod's daughter, has a reputation for being troublesome.

Ryutin is best remembered as the leader of a pro-peasant political faction organized against Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in the early 1930s and as the primary author of a 200-page oppositional platform. Ryutin was arrested by the Soviet secret police, along with his co-thinkers, in what has come to be known as the Ryutin Affair. He was executed in January 1937 as part of the Yezhovshchina (Great Purge) conducted against political oppositionists and suspected economic \\"wreckers\\" and spies. During the final years of the Soviet Union, Ryutin was politically rehabilitated, and his lengthy critique of Stalin and his policies was published for the first time. The document saw its first edition in English translation in 2010. Biography Early years Martemyan Nikitich Ryutin was born on to a peasant family in Verkhne-Ryutino, a village in Irkutsk oblast in Siberia, then part of the Russian empire.Sobhanlal Datta Gupta (ed.), The Ryutin Platform: Stalin and the Crisis of Proletarian Dictatorship: Platform of the \\"Union of Marxists-Leninists.\\" Parganas, India: Seribaan, 2010; pg. xvi. He was descended from Estonian rebels exiled to Siberia early in the 19th century. He graduated from the Irkutsk Teachers' Seminary, and worked as a teacher and journalist. Politically radical from his early years, Ryutin joined the Bolshevik Party in 1914. Ryutin was a participant in both the February Revolution which overthrew Tsar Nikolai II in 1917 and the Bolshevik Revolution in November of that same year.V.A. Torchinov and A.M. Leontiuk, Vokrug Stalina: Istoriko-biografiicheskii spravochnik (Stalin's Circle: Historical-Biographical Handbook). St. Petersburg: Philosophical Department of St. Petersburg State University, 2000; pp. 419-420. In 1917 he headed the local soviet in Harbin, a city which is today part of China. During the Russian Civil War which followed the 1917 revolution, Ryutin commanded a military group in the Irkutsk region. Political career Following his time in the military, Ryutin became a full-time political functionary of the Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks), the RKP(b). From 1920 to 1921 he was the head of the Irkutsk Guberniya Committee of the RKP(b). In 1922 he was made Secretary of the Dagestan Oblast Committee of the party, a position which he retained through 1924, when he was transferred to Moscow. In the capital, Ryutin was first named the head of the Zamoskvoreche Raion Committee of the Communist Party.Catherine Merridale, Moscow Politics and the Rise of Stalin: The Communist Party in the Capital, 1925-32. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1990; pg. 52. He was promoted to head of the more important Krasnaya Presnya Raion Committee in 1927. Ryutin was elected as a delegate to the 14th Congress (December 1925) and 15th Congress (December 1927) of what was by then known as the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks), the VKP(b). The latter elected him a candidate (non-voting) member of the Central Committee of the VKP(b). Ryutin was a supporter of the moderate agrarian policies of the New Economic Policy and held views closely associated with such \\"moderate\\" party leaders as Nikolai Bukharin, Nikolai Uglanov, and Alexei Rykov. General Secretary of the All-Union Communist Party Joseph Stalin as he appeared in 1930. With a new wave of grain procurement difficulties emerging in the fall of 1928, the Communist Party, headed by Joseph Stalin, took a radical turn towards forcing the sales of grain at below-market prices by the peasantry. This action drew the opposition of moderate Bolsheviks like Bukharin and Ryutin, who opposed the use of force and coercion against the peasantry as the manifestation of the failed agrarian policies of War Communism. The radical Stalin faction worked to capture key positions in the party to assure the implementation of the policies which they favored. At the September 24 and October 8 sessions of the Krasnopresnenskii raikom ‚Äî gatherings in which Stalin himself participated ‚Äî Ryutin came under fire for his alleged support of a \\"Right Opposition\\" led by Bukharin and Uglanov. Ryutin garnered no favor by remarking at one session that Stalin had his faults, \\"which Lenin had talked about\\" ‚Äî a pointed reference to Lenin's so-called \\"last will\\" which even drew criticism from his factional ally Uglanov.Merridale, Moscow Politics and the Rise of Stalin, pg. 58 and footnote 66 on pg. 266. By the end of the month, Ryutin had been removed from his position as Secretary of the city party committee. Ryutin was transferred to the position of Deputy Editor of Red Star, the official organ of the Red Army. He retained his seat as a candidate member of the Central Committee of the VKP(b) at this time, however. In 1929, faced with bitter peasant opposition to forced requisitioning, the Stalin faction moved towards a radical restructuring of Soviet agriculture through a drive for collectivization. The Central Committee determined to send Ryutin back to his native village in Siberia to report on the progress of collectivization in the grain-producing areas of Siberia. As a child of a peasant family, Ryutin understood full well the unpopularity of the collectivization idea with the peasantry as a whole, and the potential for economic catastrophe represented by the program.Gupta (ed.), The Ryutin Platform, pg. xvii. Upon his return to Moscow, Ryutin sharply criticized the collectivization program in a report to the Politburo. This report drew Stalin's ire, but he nevertheless made use of Ryutin's analysis as part of his seminal article, \\"Dizzy with Success.\\" In January 1930, Ryutin published an article in Red Star which again publicly challenged the implementation of the collectivization program. Shortly thereafter, Ryutin was cashiered once again, moved this time to a less sensitive position as Chairman of the Photo-Film Industry. On March 1 of that same year, Ryutin was made a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of National Economy (VSNKh), one of the leading state economic planning organizations of the period.R.W. Davies, M.J. Iliƒç, H. P. Jenkins, C. Merridale, and S.G. Wheatcroft (eds.), Soviet Government Officials, 1922-41: A Handlist. Birmingham: Centre for Russian and East European Studies, University of Birmingham, 1989; pg. 369. Unlike Bukharin and other leading members of the so-called \\"Right\\" in the Communist Party, Ryutin refused to recant his views and endorse the policies of Stalin and his associates.J. Arch Getty and Oleg V. Naumov, The Road to Terror: Stalin and the Self-Destruction of the Bolsheviks, 1932-1939. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1999; pg. 52. The Stalin faction launched an effort to eliminate Ryutin from the Communist Party in the fall of 1930. Ryutin was accused of \\"propagandizing right-opportunist views\\" and the move was made not just from the Central Committee of the VKP(b), but to expel him from the VKP(b) completely. Despite having made an aggressive defense of his position before the Central Control Commission, the Communist Party's disciplinary body, Ryutin's expulsion was ultimately confirmed by the Politburo on October 5, 1930. The Ryutin Affair Now outside the party, Ryutin no longer had protection against the secret police (OGPU). On November 13, 1930, Ryutin was arrested by the OGPU, charged with having engaged in counterrevolutionary agitation.Gupta (ed.), The Ryutin Platform, pg. xviii. Ryutin was held in jail for investigation but was ultimately released on January 17, 1931, for lack of sufficient evidence. Upon his release, Ryutin was assigned work in as an economist for an electrical production unit. In the interim, the Soviet economy had gone from bad to worse. The grain shortage of 1928 had given way to complete disorganization of agriculture by the ill-conceived collectivization campaign of 1929-30, which ‚Äî exacerbated by drought ‚Äî had ultimately resulted in a massive famine in the Ukraine, Kazakhstan and parts of southern Russia in 1932 and 1933. The entire Soviet economy was in a state of crisis. In March 1932 Ryutin was the principal writer of a 200-page document titled \\"Stalin and the Crisis of the Proletarian Dictatorship,\\" the so-called \\"Ryutin Platform,\\" which was self- prepared and secretly circulated from hand-to-hand among party members.Gupta, The Ryutin Platform, pg. xix. The so-called Ryutin Platform attacked the \\"adventurist\\" tempos of industrialization that were part of the first five- year plan, charging that they had brought about a massive fall in the real income of the working class, high taxation, and an inflationary fall in the value of the currency.Merridale, Moscow Politics and the Rise of Stalin, pg. 85. In the countryside, Ryutin declared, expropriation through the exertion of brute force had created \\"appalling impoverishment of the masses and famine\\" and the flight of \\"all the young and healthy people\\" from the countryside. Millions of surplus people cluttered the cities of the nation while the countryside starved, Ryutin charged. A second document, \\"Appeal to All Members of the VKP(b),\\" was also prepared and circulated on behalf of a faction called the Union of Marxists-Leninists. In this document, Ryutin placed the blame for the Soviet Union's catastrophic economic situation on the doorstep of General Secretary of the Communist Party Joseph Stalin, writing: > \\"The party and the dictatorship of the proletariat have been led into an > unknown blind alley by Stalin and his retinue and are now living through a > mortally dangerous crisis. With the help of deception and slander, with the > help of unbelievable pressures and terror, Stalin in the last five years has > sifted out and removed from the leadership all the best, genuinely Bolshevik > party cadres, has established in the VKP(b) and in the whole country his > personal dictatorship, has broken with Leninism, has embarked on a path of > the most ungovernable adventurism and wild personal > arbitrariness.\\"Merridale, Moscow Politics and the Rise of Stalin, pg. 85, > reprinting an excerpt published in Arkadii Vaksberg, \\"Kak zhivoi c zhivymi,\\" > Literaturnaia gazeta, June 29, 1988, pg. 13. It is unclear how many individuals read the so-called Ryutin Platform or even how many knew of its existence.Getty and Naumov, The Road to Terror, pg. 53. According to Russian historian Roy Medvedev, the opposition was organized by Ryutin with his friend P.A. Galkin and included a membership of \\"fifteen at most.\\"Roy Medvedev, Let History Judge: The Origins and Consequences of Stalinism. Revised and Expanded Edition. George Shriver, trans. New York: Columbia University Press, 1989; pg. 296. Outside of this small group, it seems that only a handful of party leaders were familiar with the content of the document, including most notably Nikolai Uglanov, According to his widow, Nikolai Bukharin was not aware of the document or its content.Aware of his impending doom, Bukharin had his young wife memorize a document called \\"To a Future Generation of Party Leaders\\" in which he asserted \\"I knew nothing about the secret organizations of Ryutin and Uglanov. Along with Rykov and Tomsky, I always expounded my views out in the open.\\" See: Anna Larina, This I Cannot Forget: The Memoirs of Nikolai Bukharin's Widow. [1988] Garry Kern, trans. New York: W.W. Norton, 1993; pp. 261-262. What is clear is that when the secret police discovered the existence of the document, they took its appeal to \\"destroy Stalin's dictatorship\\" as a call for armed revolution. On September 22, 1932, Ryutin was arrested and held for investigation. At his first interrogation, held September 24, Ryutin confirmed that he had been politically opposed to Stalin and his policies since 1928. On September 27, the Central Control Commission decided to expel 14 members of the party due to their alleged connection with Ryutin's factional group. At a second investigative hearing, conducted September 28, Ryutin acknowledged authorship of the two key factional documents mentioned above and sought to take full responsibility for them, attempting to absolve his comrades from blame. Investigations continued, however, and on October 9, 1932, the Politburo of the Communist Party voted to expel another 24 individuals from the party in light of their alleged connections to Ryutin and his group. On October 11, 1932, Pravda published a list of names of those expelled for participation in the Ryutin group.Gupta, The Ryutin Platform, pg. xx. The expulsions meted were for a period of one year. The Ryutin Platform was different from previous communist oppositional documents in that it was almost completely suppressed. As historian Catherine Merridale notes > \\"The official attitude towards the 1932 crisis was to pretend all was well; > the press was full of accounts of successes and improvements. To have the > truth so bluntly stated would have been very damaging. By 1932 it was > possible to silence a critic like Ryutin. Opposition groups could no longer > form easily, and they had no access to the media. So from the time of its > appearance until 1988, little was known about the 'Ryutin Platform's' > contents. No copy of it was available and scarcely any evidence for the > existence of a 'Ryutin group' could be found. Stalin's policy in this case > was 'not only to downgrade, crush, annihilate, but also to eliminate from > memory, erase all evidence of the existence of the objectionable > person.'\\"Merridale, Moscow Politics and the Rise of Stalin, pg. 84. At the > end of this passage Merridale is quoting Arkadii Vaksberg, \\"Kak zhivoi c > zhivymi,\\" Literaturnaia gazeta, June 29, 1988, pg. 13. A three-person Collegium of the OGPU ‚Äî consisting of GPU chairman Vyacheslav Menzhinsky, his successor Genrikh Yagoda, and future People's Commissar of Internal Affairs V. A. Balitsky ‚Äî formally decided the charges against Ryutin. While Stalin reportedly advocated a death sentence for Ryutin during Politburo deliberations, ultimately a 10-year sentence in prison resulted from his pro forma trial. Ryutin was sent first to the Ural region before being returned to Suzdal, northeast of Moscow near the city of Vladimir. Late in 1932, a number of prominent leaders of opposition movements within the Communist Party, including Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev, and Karl Radek, were called before the Central Control Committee and interrogated about whether they were aware of or had read the so-called Ryutin Platform.Getty and Naumov, The Road to Terror, pg. 54. Even knowing of the document and failing to report that knowledge was considered a crime. Zinoviev and Kamenev were again expelled from the party for their failure to report the existence of the document. Death and legacy During the period of political paranoia and spy mania remembered to history as the Yezhovshchina of 1937-38, Ryutin was retried. On January 10, 1937 the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR sentenced him to death.Gupta, The Ryutin Platform, pg. xv. He was executed that same day. The rest of Ryutin's family also suffered brutal repression at the hands of the state, with his younger son Vissarion (born 1913) similarly retried and executed in a camp in Central Asia in 1937 and his older son Vassily (born 1910) shot to death in Lefortovo prison in that same year.Gupta, The Ryutin Platform, pg. xxii. His widow was sent to a camp of the Gulag located in Karaganda, where she also perished. Only a daughter, Lyubov Ryutina, survived the terror. At the 20th Congress of the CPSU, Ryutin's daughter proposed the posthumous rehabilitation of her father and two brothers. This effort failed. On June 13, 1988, as a byproduct of the glasnost campaign of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the Supreme Court of the USSR formally rehabilitated Martemyan Ryutin. The so-called Ryutin Platform, long locked in the archives of the KGB, was published for the first time in 1990, serialized in five parts in the official journal of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Izvestiya TsK KPSS (News of the CC of the CPSU).Gupta, The Ryutin Platform, pg. ix.

Early life and career at the bar  The fourth son of Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen, the Lord Chief Justice of England, and of Ellen Mulholland, Russell was educated at Beaumont College and Oriel College, Oxford, where he gained a First in Jurisprudence in 1890. He was active in the Oxford Union, and made an 1887 speech in favour of Home Rule that led A. V. Dicey, an opponent of Home Rule, to write a letter of congratulations to his father. He was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1893. He practised at the Chancery bar in the chambers of Mr Justice Joyce. In 1908 he was appointed King's Counsel. His practice was very successful, and in 1918 he became one of the 'specials' at the Chancery bar, i.e. a barrister who charged a ¬£50 extra fee for any court appearance.  Judicial career  In 1919 Russell, a Catholic, appeared in front of the House of Lords in Bourne v Keane [1919] AC 815, in which the Lords overtuned the rule that a bequest for masses for the dead was void for being \\"for superstitious uses\\". Lord Birkenhead, who had heard the case, was so impressed by Russell's performance that he arranged for him to be appointed to the Chancery Division of the High Court the same year. Unusually, upon appointment Russell declined the customary knighthood because, as the son of a peer, he outranked a knight bachelor. In 1928 he was promoted to the Court of Appeal as a Lord Justice of Appeal. He was sworn of the Privy Council on 7 May 1928. A year later, on 18 November 1929, he was appointed Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and became a life peer as Baron Russell of Killowen, of Killowen in the County Down, the same his father already had and his son would have. He retired in 1946 for health reasons and died the same year. Russell married at the Brompton Oratory on 17 February 1900 Mary Emily Ritchie, daughter of Charles Ritchie, 1st Baron Ritchie of Dundee. They had one son, Charles Ritchie Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen, also a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary.

The play premiered Off-Broadway in 2004 and won the 2005 Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Off-Broadway Play. The play had its London premiere in 2008 and was nominated for Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Comedy. The play involves a romantic relationship between a plus-size woman and a young professional man, whose friend denigrates the woman as being \\"fat\\".  Plot synopsis  Fat Pig tells the story of Tom, a stereotypical professional businessman in a large city, who falls for a very plus-size librarian named Helen. They meet in a crowded restaurant at lunchtime and begin speaking to each other. Tom is taken with her brash acceptance of the way people see her and her in-your-face honesty. He asks her for her phone number and they start to date. A couple of weeks later, Carter, Tom‚Äôs best friend, starts to notice the signs of Tom having a new girlfriend. He obnoxiously pesters him for information about the new girl and in order to get it mentions it in front of a woman from accounting, Jeannie, who has been seeing Tom on-and-off for a while. She gets very upset which gets Tom to admit that he is ‚Äúsort of‚Äù seeing this new woman in his life. Carter asks Tom what he is doing that night, and Tom says he is busy. Carter knows then that he is meeting Helen at a restaurant Tom frequents, Tom denies it and says it is a business dinner with people from the Chicago branch of their firm. Carter, not believing him, stops by the restaurant and sees them together. He approaches them and introduces himself to Helen, and she excuses herself to go to the restroom. While she is gone Carter thoroughly insults her weight and calling her a lot of horrible things ('fat pig' among others), not knowing that this is Tom‚Äôs new girlfriend. He assumes then that Tom was telling the truth about the people coming in from Chicago and that Helen is one of his business contacts, since he thought that Tom would never date anyone that ‚Äúfat‚Äù. Later that week, Jeannie pays a visit to Tom in his office. She has found out that no people from Chicago came to visit. She demands to know what is going on with him and her and he says that he is not interested in her and will never be again. Earlier, she and Carter had been gossiping about the ‚Äúfat cow from Chicago,‚Äù which is how Jeannie found out about the whole thing. So once Tom says that it wasn‚Äôt a business dinner, she flips out and smacks him, hurt that he would pick someone like Helen (an obese woman) over her. Carter looks on and sort of apologizes for being rude about Helen, saying that he didn‚Äôt know she was his girlfriend. He asks to see a picture and after a lot of pestering gets one from Tom. He then proceeds to run down the hall and show everyone who laughs behind Tom's back about the \\"fat pig\\" that he is dating. Throughout the rest of the play, Carter tries to convince Tom that he should ‚Äústick to his own kind.‚Äù Meanwhile, Tom and Helen are falling more and more in love. One day, Helen informs Tom that she has been offered a better job in another town but she doesn‚Äôt want to leave him. She asks if she can meet his friends, but when he is hesitant, she knows that he is ashamed of her involving her weight. But not wanting to give her that impression, he tells her that she will meet his friends when they have a work barbecue on the beach. The day arrives for the outing, but once they get there they are secluded from everyone with the attendees making jokes and ridiculing Helen's weight behind her back. Seeing that Tom is clearly embarrassed being around her which has now led to him being ostracized by everyone he knows over dating an obese woman, Helen brings up her concerns and gives Tom an ultimatum: either accept all of her of who she is and that includes defending her to his friends, or their relationship cannot work. He replies that he cannot handle it and that she should take the job in the other town. Both Tom and Helen walk away from each other, broken hearted.  Character guide  *Tom: The plot's protagonist. Late 20s to early 30s, he is a stereotypical man for his age group, until he meets Helen, who he subsequently falls in love with. *Helen: A quite heavy, though self-confident librarian. She becomes Tom's love interest and the catalyst for his change of view. *Carter: Tom's closest friend at the office. Carter represents the narcissistic and shallow qualities that Tom is trying to overcome. Carter is the play's consummate antagonist. *Jeannie: Another co-worker at Tom's unnamed office firm. She and Tom used to date, but Tom was never fully committed to the relationship. Jeannie's self-confidence is damaged because Tom dumps her for a \\"fat girl\\". Labute provides very few details about the specifics of the characters' lives, beside from the fact that they all work and are in approximately the same age group.

In that year 'West' amalgamated with Technical High School to become Hagley High School. As part of that amalgamation, the maroon, black and white colours were changed to teal. History St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church and The Academy in 1858 at Hospital corner; the church was later relocated to Rangi Ruru Girls' School The school was opened on 15 November 1858 by the St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church on their triangular site formed by Tuam Street, Antigua Street, and Oxford Terrace. The original name was Christchurch Academy and the school enjoyed a good reputation. The school committee that ran the school decided in 1863 that a bigger site was needed and they purchased the current school grounds opposite South Hagley Park some from their original site. The name changed to High School of Christchurch when the school relocated in July 1863. A main source of income for early Christchurch schools was an annual grant by the Canterbury Provincial Council, with funds distributed to school committees in proportion of the denomination of the population. The educational system changed in 1873 and the province discontinued its grants. Reluctantly, the school committee decided to offer the school buildings and grounds to the newly established West Christchurch educational committee. The chairman of the West Christchurch educational committee, Henry Tancred, sanctioned the purchase in September 1873. The school was renamed West Christchurch Borough School and it became public that year; 70 existing pupils transferred to the new school. The roll greatly increased and by the end of 1877, there were 868 pupils.

The school started at Amissano, a village near Elmina, in 1930. The Roman Catholic institution was established to serve as a training college and seminary. The school was named after St. Augustine of Hippo (354 ‚Äì 430 AD). The motto of the college is Omnia Vincit Labor, meaning \\"Perseverance conquers All\\".The school has a total of 11 houses.  History  St. Augustine's is the first catholic institution in the training of male teachers. It is also the first catholic second cycle school (senior high school) to be built in Gold Coast, (now Ghana). St. Augustine‚Äôs College is the biggest catholic senior high school in Ghana to date. The college ground and playing fields cover an area of about 1.30 acres. It is bounded by Fosu Lagoon/Adisadel Estates to the North, St. Augustine‚Äôs Practice J.H.S., the Catholic Education Unit and Archbishop‚Äôs House to the West, the Cape Coast metropolitan Hospital and part of the Fosu Lagoon to the East and the Atlantic Ocean to the South. It is about 1.8 km from Cape Coast Town Hall (Bakaano) and about 2.3 km from the West gate of University of Cape Coast. The school has a student population of about 1,900 and a faculty number of about 90. On 6 August 1933, the Roman Catholic Church and the Bishop of Cape Coast Vicariate Monsignor W. T. Porter felt the need to have a separate Roman Catholic school and Cape Coast was found to be the most suitable location. A commemorative foundation stone was laid in late 1935 at the present site. Fr. Maurice B. Kelly, the Dean of the Training College at Amissano which is now St. Teresa‚Äôs Seminary, Amisano, became the first Head Dean or Headmaster.  Culture  The Dean, Professors, Senior Student Counsel/Prefect, the Dining Hall Counsel/Prefect and the Chapel Counsel/Prefect and their assistants are all Roman Catholic. The Anniversary/Ceremonial Day of the school takes place on the Saturday nearest St. Patrick‚Äôs Day, which falls around the second or third week in March. St. Augustine‚Äôs College, popularly known as \\"AUGUSCO\\",http://www.augusco.org/ calls its old students \\"APSUNIANS\\" Due to the historical association and their common catholic antecedents, there is a tendency for Holy Child High School, Ghana old students (HOPSA) and St. Augustine‚Äôs old students (APSUNIANS) to get married. The church believes marriage between old students of the two schools will perpetuate the Catholic traditions.  Student body  The population of the school is roughly 2000. Day students account for less than 2% of enrollment. St. Augustine's College is known for its general arts, business and science programs. The college continues to educate Ghana's elite, and has a para-military cadet program which prepares students to enroll in the Military Officers Academy. Many students follow family tradition by enrolling at the school. Admission is highly competitive, perhaps the boys' institution with most annual applications, and includes a scholarship program for disadvantaged students. It has exchange programs with foreign institutions such as the German Goethe Institute and AFS Intercultural Program. The students are among the highest performing in the WAEC exams and it has won the most of the yearly inter-schools athletic competitions.

These specific tasks encompass all operations from vehicle acquisition through maintenance to disposal. Fleet management software functions The main function of fleet management software is to accumulate, store, process, monitor, report on and export information. Information can be imported from external sources such as gas pump processors, territorial authorities for managing vehicle registration (for example DVLA and VOSA), financial institutions, insurance databases, vehicle specification databases, mapping systems and from internal sources such as Human Resources and Finance. Vehicle management Fleet management software should be able to manage processes, tasks and events related to all kinds of vehicles - car, trucks, earth-moving machinery, buses, forklift trucks, trailers and specialist equipment, including: * Vehicle inventory - the number and type of vehicles * Vehicle maintenance - specific routine maintenance and scheduled maintenance, and ad hoc requirements * Licensing, registration, MOT and tax * Vehicle insurance including due dates and restrictions * Cost management and analysis * Vehicle disposal Driver management * Driver license management, including special provisions * Logging of penalty points and infringements against a licence * Booking system for pool vehicles *Passenger safety (SOS) Incident management * Accidents and fines, plus apportioning costs to drivers Tracking * Telematics * Route planning * Logbooks and work time * Alerts Fleet management metrics to track * Identification Metrics such as vehicle ID, company ID, location ID * Utilization Metrics such as mileage and fuel data * Behavioral Metrics like average speed and harsh acceleration * Trip Metrics like number of trips, average duration * Maintenance Metrics like maintenance costs and number of diagnostics Software procurement and development Fleet management software can be developed in-house by the company or organisation using it, or be purchased from a third party.

An Xbox 360 release, titled Espgaluda II Black Label, was released in 2010 in Japan. Gameplay Instead of having to repeatedly tap the shot button for rapid fire, the feature is on by default. In most of Cave's other manic shooter games, rapid fire is usually an option that must be enabled through the game's BIOS by an arcade operator. The game still utilizes the Kakusei, or Awakening, mode from the first game, where enemies and bullets are slowed down at the cost of collectible green gems, or Seireiseki. In this mode, any enemies that are defeated have their remaining bullets on screen transformed into gold ingots that can be collected to boost the player's score. However, Espgaluda II also adds the ability for enemies to release yet another set of shots when they are defeated. These bullets are destroyed when destroying another enemy, which in turn creates another wave of bullets. During that attack phase, the score multiplier for destroyed bullets can be raised up to 500. Another returning feature from the first game is the Guard Barrier, which absorbs enemy attacks at the expense of a Guard Barrier Gauge. When the player is hit by an enemy bullet, the Guard Barrier is automatically activated. However, in this game, the Guard Barrier is always used until its gauge is depleted. Players can gain extra lives after earning 15 million and 35 million points, or by obtaining the life extend item in stage 3. The Xbox 360 version features online leaderboards, redrawn HD graphics, the ability to save replays, and has the following modes: Arcade Mode, Xbox 360 Mode (identical to arcade but with HD graphics), Novice Mode, Black Label Novice Mode (Seseri is playable), Black Label (Seseri is playable), Arrange Mode, Omake Mode (unlocked after beating any mode on any settings). The iOS/Android versions feature controls unique to the iPhone/iPod touch, allowing players to unleash an Awakening Pulse against the enemy by touching parts of the screen. Using this attack in conjunction with the high risk, high return scoring system allows the player to maximize his or her high score. The game also features the classic Arcade mode, three difficulty settings and three control settings. Plot The game takes place in a fictional land called Soma, three years after a massive war known as the Great Shinra War devastated the land and killed most of its plant life. Humanity is forced to pull their efforts together for the sake of survival and reforestation. Using new found technology, an alchemist named Hiodoshi spearheaded a project called Project Espgaluda, which gathered youths and used them as experimental test subjects for artificial armored wings. They were then called Galuda, named after the mythical bird of legend. Ageha and Tateha were two of the subjects who escaped during the project. At the end of Espgaluda, they were reunited with their mother and lived peacefully after going into hiding. Espgaluda II begins when they are discovered. Characters Protagonists: * Asagi: A 12-year-old girl who was the third Galuda to be produced from the project. She has the weakest normal shot out of the three main characters. Fires vertical shots in shot mode. In rapier mode, enemy marked by search spirit is automatically targeted. She is voiced by Ikumi Fujiwara, while her male counterpart is voiced by Yuki Fuji. * Ageha: Tateha's older brother. He is a 21-year-old man who was also the protagonist from the first game. In game, his normal shot is a strong concentrated forward shot. In shot mode, moving joystick horizontally causes the shots to move diagonally. He is voiced by Shuya Kishimoto, and his female counterpart is voiced by Aiko Igarashi. * Tateha: A 19-year-old girl also appearing from the first game. She is Ageha's younger sister. She wields a wide-angled forward shot. Fires in wide angle formation in shot mode, forward formation in rapier mode, which also shoots through enemies. She is voiced by Emi Kawauchi, and her male counterpart is voiced by Kyo Sakai. Antagonists: * Tsubame: Soma's 10-year-old prince. He is the son of Soma's ruler and is the boss of Stage 1. * Madara The 27-year-old commissioned officer of the Soma Army's Mechanized Unit. He is the mid-boss of Stage 2 and the boss of Stage 4. * Janome: The 11-year-old princess of Soma.

Release The game's soundtrack was released on July 26, 2006. It was composed by Manabu Namiki and Mitsuhiro Kaneda and was published by Cave. Following the region-free release of Mushihime-sama Futari, Makoto Asada of Cave announced that the standard edition of Espgaluda II Black Label will be region-free, allowing North American and European players to import the game.

XX.) in Rome. This is one of three churches affiliated with the Trappist monastery, and is located on a small lane, Via delle Tre Fontane, inside the abbey complex. The location of this church is held by tradition to be where St Paul the Apostle was imprisoned.The crypt is held to be the prison where he was held before his martyrdom on Via delle Tre Fontane in Rome. History An ancient church at the site was refurbished in 1582 by Vignola under the patronage of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. Subsequently the present church was designed by Giacomo della Porta under the patronage of Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini. The interior layout is octagonal. On the stairs leading to it can be seen writing and drawings scratched into the stone, probably information from the architect to the builders. The church presbytery contains a mosaic by Francesco Zucca made after designs of Giovanni della Vecchia.Guida metodica di Roma e suoi contorni, by Giuseppe Melchiorri, Rome (1836); page 434. An old tradition claims that 10,000 Christian slaves who died while building the Baths of Diocletian are buried in the church's crypt, and are venerated as St ZenoThough his relics were moved to Santa Prassede in the 9th century. and Companions. Some dead slaves from this project are likely buried in catacombs in the nearby hillside, though the 10,000 figure must be exaggerated. According to legend, St Bernard had a vision while celebrating a requiem mass at the church. The vision was of the souls in purgatory he was praying for ascending to heaven by a ladder ‚Äî the Scala Coeli, leading to the church's suffix. This vision was the basis for an indulgence attached to requiem masses celebrated in the church. Later, the indulgence was granted to specific churches outside Rome. In 1500, Henry VII of England was granted the scala coeli indulgence for his new chapel in Westminster Abbey, and the popularity of it in England grew rapidly. By the 1520s, bequests for masses \\"at Scala Coeli\\" were common. The church belongs to the Trappist Tre Fontane Abbey, along with the churches of Santi Vincenzo e Anastasio and San Paolo alle Tre Fontane. The church of Scala Coeli was already used by the Romanian Orthodox community in Rome before November 2002 when, to mark the visit to Rome of Teoctist, Patriarch of Romania, Pope John Paul II officially granted it to them. Previously, they had also gathered in the Chapel of Our Lady of Genezano off Via Cavour, but that chapel had become too small.

It is a naturally lighted cavern with a deep lagoon and many large stalactites and stalagmites. The cave is lit by sunlight which filters through holes in the ceiling. The underground lake is a popular swimming spot, but it has been known to test for high levels of various pollutants, since it is fed by ground runoff. Hinagdanan Cave is made of limestone. The entrance of the cave is a hole of about 1 metre wide in diameter, visible from a limestone hill. Cemented steps lead to the interior of the cave. The cave is slippery, but there's a railing made of rope to hold on to avoid accident due to slippery stones of the cave. The cave is filled with sleeping birds in small holes in the ceiling. The sunlight that permeates is unsuitable for bats. Hinagdanan Cave was accidentally discovered when the owner of the area was clearing the decaying branches of the land when he found the hole. The owner threw a stone into the hole, then he heard a splash. Then he built a ladder to get into the cave. They named it Hinagdanan, means \\"laddered\\" used to get into the cave's interior. The cave is about 100 metres long of beautiful rock formations. The stalactites and stalagmites stick out from the ceiling and floor of the cave as though trying to meet each other. Inside the cave, there's also a lagoon with a greenish surface produced by the green limestone at the bottom of the pool, where people used to bath in the lagoon, however, it has been advised to not go dip into the lagoon because of the karst pollutants present in the water.

His major excavations included Dinas Powys hill fort in Wales, Cadbury Castle in Somerset and a series of major hillforts in Scotland. Early years Alcock was born in Manchester. His intellectual prowess was demonstrated early, when he won a scholarship to Manchester Grammar School in 1935. Details of Alcock's military career are sketchy. His obituaries, which are uniformly hagiographical in tone and simply repeat the information given in Alcock's entry in Who's Who, state that Alcock left school and joined the army in 1942 to fight in the Second World War as a captain in the Gurkhas. This seems unlikely, as he would have been only 16 or 17 years old at the time. In fact, he did not join the 7th Gurkha Rifles, as an Emergency Commissioned Officer, until 1944.Unpublished records held by the 7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles Regimental Association It is unclear how he spent the years 1942-4, although officer training may account for some of this period. There is no record that he ever saw active service. These inconsistencies cast doubt on other aspects of traditional accounts of Alcock's time in India. Although it is widely claimed that he was fluent in Urdu and Punjabi, there is no evidence to corroborate this. What seems more clear is that Alcock developed an interest in archaeology during his posting to the Indian sub-continent. After demobilisation in 1946, he won a scholarship to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he read Modern History from 1946 to 1949. He pursued his interest in archaeology through the Oxford Archaeology Society, becoming its president. He met his wife Elizabeth during this period, and they were married in 1950, shortly before he left Britain to become the first director of the Archaeological Survey of Pakistan. He had previously returned to the sub-continent to serve as Sir Mortimer Wheeler's deputy on the excavations at Mohenjodaro. This relationship was to prove more valuable than the directorship of the survey, which he left after not being paid for several months. Back in Britain, a short stint as curator at the Abbey House Museum in Leeds in 1952 was followed by a post as a junior lecturer in the Department of Archaeology at Cardiff University. He was to remain in Cardiff for 20 years, rising to the level of Reader, and undertaking his major southern British excavations at D√Ænas Powys in Wales (Alcock 1963) and South Cadbury (Alcock 1972). During this period, Cardiff was to emerge as one of the powerhouses of archaeology in British universities, and many of the leading figures in British archaeology today encountered Alcock as a teacher at that time. Cadbury The excavation at Cadbury Castle, South Cadbury, made Alcock's name. The hillfort had a traditional link with Camelot and the Arthurian legends, and Alcock made sure that the media were aware of his work. The five seasons of the excavations were widely reported, making Alcock into one of the better known British archaeologists of the time. His methodology made headlines within the archaeological community with his use of geophysical survey, which in at the time before its prominent use by archaeological television programme Time Team was an unusual and experimental process; while he also preferred the use of open-area excavation to the Wheeler method that held sway at the time. This methodology was to become the standard technique for British archaeology from the start of large scale rescue work in the 1970s, and shows that Alcock was at the cutting edge of archaeology. Alcock's sense of humour also came out during the excavations. He had a good understanding of what visitors to the site wanted to see, so he had a plastic skeleton excavated from the same spot every afternoon, with a bucket beside the trench to take donations for the diggers' welfare fund. The money was used to the benefit of the local economy each evening in the pub. The results of the excavation were impressive. The earliest identifiable occupation on the hill was Early and Late Neolithic. After an apparent hiatus during the earlier Bronze Age it was reoccupied in the centuries around 1000BC, remaining so continuously until at least the first century AD. His excavations produced scant evidence for Roman occupation, aside from a barracks block of the latter first century but demonstrated that it was the largest reoccupied fortified hilltop in post-Roman Britain. He also identified Late Saxon refurbishment of the defences and a foundation trench for a probable cruciform church, apparently never completed but intended to meet the needs of moneyers moved to the hill for security during the early 11th century AD. Alcock was able to tell evocative stories of the history of the fort, and particularly of its fate during the Roman period, where there was clear evidence of a violent attack on the fort. However, the scale of the material recovered meant that his publication of the site (Alcock 1972) was really a large scale interim report. Final publication waited until 1995 for the Early Medieval material, which he published himself in 1995 (Alcock 1995), and 2000 for the earlier material (Barrett et al. 2000). The main drawback for Alcock was that he had now become irrevocably connected with Arthur in the minds of the public. From 1994 until his death in 2006 Alcock was patron of the South Cadbury Environs Project, a programme of research exploring the landscape around the hillfort.South Cadbury Environs Project Later career The publicity from the South Cadbury excavations meant that Alcock was one of Britain's best known archaeologists in the early 1970s. This was reflected in 1973, when he was appointed to the newly established Chair of Archaeology at Glasgow University. This was an opportunity to re-focus his archaeological direction, and to build a new department. The latter was achieved by the appointment of promising young talent alongside more established colleagues; these younger academics currently hold senior positions in British universities. The former opportunity was realised by moving away from Arthur to look at the Dark Age sites of Scotland. At this time, the Dark Ages were darker for Scotland than for England because of the paucity of written records for Scotland in the period and the lack of clearly Dark Age sites. Some had been identified in earlier work, but virtually nothing was known about this important period of Scotland's past. His changing focus can be seen with a review of Pictish settlements (Alcock 1980), but his manifesto for his new research trajectory came in a publication looking at hillforts across Britain (Alcock 1981), although he had been working on this trajectory from 1973 (Alcock & Alcock 1992, 216). In this paper, Alcock listed the centres of political power named in the various annals relating to Scotland in this period; these annals were all from outwith Scotland and were mainly Irish. Having named the important sites, he then set out to link the placename with a particular archaeological site. In some cases, he was able to show a good degree of confidence in the identification; in others, he was less sure and later changed his mind, such as with Urquhart Castle, which he downgraded from Bridei mac Maelchon's fort to the fort of a Pictish noble mentioned in Adomn√°n's Life of Columba (Alcock & Alcock 1992, 242). As a result of this list, Alcock undertook a series of what he called 'reconnaissance excavations' on sites in the list; today, these would be termed evaluations. The purpose of these was very different from the large scale excavation of South Cadbury. Rather than an extensive excavation producing large amounts of data, the intention was to target specific areas of each site to recover evidence that would indicate whether or not the site had been occupied during the Dark Ages. His fieldwork was published in a series of reports in the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland (Alcock et al. 1986; Alcock & Alcock 1987; Alcock et al. 1989; Alcock & Alcock 1990; Alcock & Alcock 1992). The results of the excavations indicated that he had been correct in the majority of his identifications, and he had achieved his intention of providing a base of information for others to work from. It is also important to note the involvement of his wife Elizabeth in the publishing of these papers. She was an integral part of the research programme and was an archaeologist in her own right. Retirement Leslie Alcock retired from the University of Glasgow in 1990. He was still working on the publications of his reconnaissance excavations and on the publication of the South Cadbury excavation. His involvement in the latter decreased after his publication of the early Medieval material in 1995, and the earlier periods were left to a team of researchers from the Department of Archaeology at Glasgow University, led by John C. Barrett. He was now working more on synthetic works about the early Medieval period and trying not to have any more to do with Arthur, who had become something of a millstone to him. His work culminated in the publication of a book based upon his 1989 Rhind lectures, Kings & Warriors, Craftsmen & Priests (Alcock 2003). By this time, he had been appointed an OBE (in 1991), but his health was now failing and he retired fully from Archaeology. He died on 6 June 2006, at Stevenage.

It is an affiliation of junior clubs in the Eastern Suburbs area, covering the Woollahra and Waverley local government areas (LGAs), the northern parts of the Randwick LGA and also the eastern areas of the City of Sydney LGA. Clubs Current The district currently consists of the following four clubs. Bondi United, Clovelly Crocodiles, St Charles Waverley, Paddington Colts. Former The district formerly consisted of the following clubs. Astra Hotel Knights, Bondi Junction Hotel, Bondi Royals, Bondi Sharks, Brighton Hotel Jets, Brothers, Coogee Bay Hotel, Coogee Dolphins, Double Bay, Dunbar United, East Randwick, Nelson Sharks, Paddington CYO, Paddington Tigers Rose Bay Rams, Tea Gardens Hotel, Woollahra Waratahs, Woolloomooloo Warriors. The Paddington Colts is also a longstanding former Eastern Suburbs Junior club, which has announced its return to the junior league competition for the 2016 season, after 15 years lying dormant. Another longstanding former Eastern Suburbs Junior club The Paddington - Woollahra RSL Tigers entered the competition in 1965 competing in Balmain colors black & gold until they merged with Paddington Colts to become the Paddington Tigers who wore the traditional Easter Suburbs tri-colour red white & blue. Notable juniors Notable juniors who played in the Eastern Suburbs District Junior Rugby League include. Anthony Cherrington, Blake Ayshford, Bryan Fletcher, Craig Field, Craig Salvatori, Ferris Ashton, Ian Rubin, James Tamou, Jim Dymock, John Peard, Johnny Mayes, Kevin Hastings, Kevin Junee, Lachlan Lam, Luke Ricketson, Luke Towers, Matthew Elliott, Paul Dunn, Ryan Cross, Sandor Earl, Shaun Kenny Dowall, Tom Symonds, Victor Radley, Angus Crichton. Turf wars The new boundaries set out in the early 1950s. When the Sydney Roosters or Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club (ESDRLFC) first entered the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition in 1908, the tricolours would become neighbours to fellow city counterpart, the South Sydney Rabbitohs, then the South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club (SSDRLFC). The original articles of association binding both the ESDRLFC and SSDRLFC with the NSWRL defined the territories of both clubs. Easts were formed to represent the local government areas of the City of Sydney, Darlinghurst, Paddington, Vaucluse, Woollahra, Waverley and Randwick. Meanwhile, Souths were to represent the local government areas of Redfern, Alexandria, Zetland, Waterloo, Mascot and Botany. Notwithstanding the local junior boundary changes referred to in this article, these articles of association have not changed, and as such the Roosters at senior level technically represent all of the local government areas as assigned in 1908, subsequent council mergers aside. As such, Anzac Parade separated the territories for both inner-Sydney clubs when the boundaries were first established the previous year. Souths' boundaries were based on the municipalities of Redfern, Botany, Alexandria, Mascot and Waterloo, while the Roosters' boundaries were those of the eastern municipalities of Paddington, Woollahra, Vaucluse, Randwick and Waverley. Many of these councils had then amalgamated, as demographic changes affected the inner and eastern suburbs of Sydney. Randwick Council has a western and southern boundary of Anzac Parade and incorporates all those eastern suburbs east of Anzac Parade, and these suburbs like Waverly, Bondi, and Woollahra were all part of the Roosters' territory since 1908. The new residential league boundaries set out in 1937 would take junior league territory away from the Roosters, and hand it over to rival neighbouring club South Sydney after Easts had won 3 premierships in a row.. There was request in 1955 to return this area but it was not approved by the NSWRFL. In the mid-20th century, the southern half of Roosters junior territory within the Randwick local government area was handed to South Sydney. The NSWRL made this change to 'even the competition' as South Sydney's original heartland, around Redfern and Waterloo, had rapidly industrialised and de-populated. Rabbitohs stalwart S.G. Ball was a dual administrator within South Sydney Rabbitohs and the New South Wales Rugby League at the time. The Rabbitohs were in a highly successful period and had established South Sydney Juniors Rugby League Club in Kingsford, Roosters territory in recent times. Debate still continues amongst rival fans as to how and why Eastern Suburbs junior territory, comprising suburbs with junior league clubs rich in talent and numbers in the Randwick and Coogee areas, was given to South Sydney. The Roosters expressed disappointment at losing some of its junior clubs, but the NSWRL would not waver. This was not to be the end of struggle for junior territory between the two inner-city clubs. In the 1980s some junior clubs such as Paddington Colts that were within Roosters territory became dissatisfied with Roosters management and affiliated with South Sydney. After the Newtown Jets were expelled from the NSWRL in 1983, most of their junior district was eventually absorbed into the South Sydney junior district in 1987, with some pockets absorbed by the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. With the tide having turned compared to the situation decades earlier, and the Roosters having a much smaller junior League than South Sydney, Eastern Suburbs at this time then made unsuccessful attempts to regain the suburbs on the same grounds used to hand the southern parts of Coogee and Randwick from Easts to Souths, that of providing an 'even competition'. The NSWRL, controlled at the time by a Board with a ruling faction of representatives from South Sydney (Terry Parker), Balmain (Keith Barnes), Canterbury (Peter Moore) and Manly (Ken Arthurson), refused to redraw the boundaries. In a new dawn for the Eastern Suburbs District Junior Rugby League, the long dormant Paddington Colts club has announced it will be fielding teams in most junior league grades in the 2016 season. After spending its previous last few years in the 1990s affiliated with the Rabbitohs, the Colts have announced they will be returning to the fold and allying themselves with their traditional senior partners, the Roosters. Known as only 'the Colts' during their time estranged from the Roosters, the newly formed junior club will once again display proudly the Paddington suburban name, having returned home as a Roosters junior club. Rugby League legends Brad Fittler and Bryan Fletcher will coach and mentor young Colts players, while Roosters assistant coach Andrew Johns will also impart his knowledge upon young Rugby League aspirants in Sydney's east. Sydney Roosters officials and legendary players are hopeful the resurrection of Paddo Colts will spark a renewal of junior Rugby League in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs. Other areas on which the game had prominany junior league teams are currently under analysis for potential resurrection. Areas which may field future junior Rugby League teams in the East of Sydney include Rose Bay, Woolloomooloo, Waverley, Bondi Junction and North-Eastern Randwick and Coogee.

The Cape Race LORAN-C transmitter was used as an antenna tower until February 2, 1993. It was a 411.48 m (1350 ft) tall guyed mast, built in 1965. This mast was the tallest structure in Canada until the construction of the CN Tower in Toronto, and remained the second-tallest structure until its collapse on February 2, 1993. The collapse was the result of a fatigue failure of the eyebolt head in a compression cone insulator on a structural guy-wire. This failure caused swing-in damage that resulted in the tower's collapse. The tower was replaced by a 260.3 meter (854 ft) tall guyed mast, insulated against the ground. The Cape Race LORAN-C transmitter was used until 1993 as part of the LORAN-C Chain GRI 9930 and worked with a transmission power of 1800 kilowatts. The Cape Race LORAN-C transmitter acted as the Yankee Secondary Transmitter of the Canadian East Coast LORAN-C chain (GRI 5930) and as the Whiskey Secondary of the Newfoundland East Coast LORAN-C chain (GRI 7270).

The original models were introduced in 1959 to replace the U model guitars, and were in production until the closure of the Danelectro company in 1969. There have been multiple re-issues of this line of guitars, the first two being the 59DC with two pickups and DC-3 with three pickups, sold between 1998 and 2001. The 59 Dano followed in 2007 and the 59-DC in 2009. The Shorthorn range comes in one, two and three pickup models, and has the \\"Coke Bottle Style\\" classic headstock, hollowed body cavity, and a seal shaped pick guard with two concentric \\"stacked\\" tone/volume knobs. The second reissue series (2007-2009) was Chinese-made, with an asymmetric headstock and bog-standard (non-stacked) master tone and volume knobs. In 2014, Danelectro announced several improvements for its latest iteration, the '59M NOS. Manufacturing returns to Korea for the new model, along with stacked concentric knobs and canonical headstock profile. Featured hardware in some models includes tuneable die-cast bridge and NOS Lipstick pickups manufactured in 1999., being of all reissues, the most true to the original. Danelectro Convertible Danelectro Convertible reissue The Danelectro Convertible was a hollow-bodied thinline acoustic/electric guitar based on the Shorthorn. It had a conventional round sound hole with a lipstick pickup mounted across the hole. The Convertible name came from the ability to play it unplugged as an acoustic guitar or plugged in as an electric guitar. The Convertible has the double cutaway shape used on Danelectro's DC series of guitars. The Convertible was originally produced in the 1960s. It was offered as a reissue between 1998 and 2001. The guitar is currently being reissued. The reissues differ from the originals in that they have mounted the pickup diagonally across the soundhole, and there is only one concentric knob as opposed to two separate tone and volume knobs. The reissues also have a cable jack located in the strap knob. The Convertible had a floating bridge and a separate tailpiece. On the Convertible, the tailpiece was used to hold the strings equally apart while the metal riser on the bridge was not notched, with the undesirable result that the strings slid back & forth on the bridge when the guitarist bent strings while playing. Manny's demonstration guitar One noteworthy Danelectro 59 DC resides at Sam Ash Music (formerly the famed Manny's Music store) on West 48th Street in New York City. The guitar had been painted a light yellow, along with other brightly painted instruments, for a promotional photo; afterwards the guitar served as the official demo model for customers to try out amplifiers or effects pedals. Consequently, \\"The Yellow Danelectro\\" has been played by dozens of well-known and notable guitarists - including Bob Dylan, John Lennon, Mark Knopfler, Eric Clapton, and others - who enjoyed the sound of the guitar to the point that some attempted to buy the not-for-sale guitar. The guitar, which eventually broke in half at the neck, is displayed in a glass case at Sam Ash, together with the unverifiable claim that it may have been played by more musicians than any other electric guitar. Notable players Eric Clapton (far right) holding his Danelectro Shorthorn guitar while posing with the other members of Blind Faith in 1969. Syd Barrett, frontman of the early Pink Floyd, usually played this guitar before switching to a Fender Esquire. Also Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin used this model of guitar on live performances in 1975 at Earl's Court and from 1979-80 for \\"Kashmir\\", \\"In My Time of Dying\\", \\"Black Mountain Side\\", and \\"White Summer\\". When Eric Clapton was with Blind Faith he used this model with a psychedelic paint job. Before he played bass and sang lead for Chicago (band), Peter Cetera bought a Danelectro to be his very first bass guitar in the early 1960s. More recently, Christopher Wolstenholme, bassist of Muse, has occasionally used one live on songs where he plays guitar, most notably on \\"Unintended\\". In 1960, Jimi Hendrix's father bought him a copper single-pickup Silvertone Danelectro, named \\"Betty Jean\\" after Hendrix's high school girlfriend. Soul singer-songwriter Lianne La Havas has been noted as using a Silvertone Danelectro both onstage and in the recording studio. Dexter Romweber, former lead singer and guitarist for Flat Duo Jets, has primarily used the Silvertone 1448 model throughout his career. In the 1990 music video for the song \\"Birdhouse in Your Soul\\", They Might Be Giants guitarist John Flansburgh is seen playing a Danelectro 59DC.

Leigh is best known for his Concertino for harpsichord and string orchestra, written in 1934. Other famous works include the overture Agincourt and The Frogs of Aristophanes for chorus and orchestra. He wrote music for documentary films and there is an unfinished sketch for a symphony. Career Walter Leigh was born in Wimbledon. His first teacher was Harold Darke, with whom he worked from the age of eight until he was seventeen. He went to Christ's College, Cambridge, studying composition with Cyril Rootham and graduating in 1926. For two years thereafter, he studied composition under Paul Hindemith at the Berlin Hochschule f√ºr Musik. In 1930, Leigh declined a teaching job and set about earning a living by accepting small commissions and becoming increasingly involved with the theatre. With V.C. Clinton-Baddeley he wrote a pantomime for the Festival Theatre at Cambridge, and two comic operas, the second of which, Jolly Roger, ran for six months at the Savoy Theatre in London, with a cast headed by George Robey. He composed an elaborate score for Basil Wright's documentary film The Song of Ceylon and the concert overture Agincourt, commissioned by the BBC in celebration of King George V's Silver Jubilee. The Harpsichord Concertino is one of a number of chamber works of the period: an elegant and concise work, more French than German in its spare- noted neo-classicism, the keyboard writing showing signs of Ravel's influence. For the Cambridge production of The Frogs in 1936, Leigh produced another score precision-made for the occasion. The music for A Midsummer Night's Dream was written for an open-air schools performance at Weimar in 1936; it is scored for flute, clarinet, trumpet, strings and harpsichord. Music for String Orchestra is a work written sympathetically for amateurs in four movements: Adagio ‚Äì Vivo ‚Äì Lento ‚Äì Allegro. The only other major commission Leigh undertook before the outbreak of war was to produce the music for Herbert Farjeon's intimate revue Nine Sharp (1938). He was a composer who thrived on limitations and who needed the right external stimulus if he was to produce the best work that it was in him to do. He was a craftsman-composer of a type more common in the 18th century than the 20th century. Almost all his music was written for immediate use; like Haydn, he would not have dreamed of fulfilling a commission without ascertaining the probable capabilities of his performers; he could turn to any number of different idioms according to the needs of the occasion. An obituary in The Times credits Leigh as being \\"the first British composer to undertake a complete study of the many problems relating to the sound-track in the production of films\\", and cites the score for The Song of Ceylon as \\"a classic example of the creative use of music and sound in relation to the visuals on the screen.\\" The majority of the orchestral and chamber works have been recorded on the Lyrita and Dutton Epoch labels. The piano music and some art songs were recorded on the Tremula label. The Harpsichord Concertino was recorded by Kathleen Long in 1946 using a piano. In 1941, during the Second World War, he joined the British Army and served as a trooper with the Royal Armoured Corps, 4th Queen's Own Hussars. He was killed in action near Tobruk, Libya in 1942, just before his 37th birthday, leaving a widow, Marion, and three children, Julian, Veronica and Andrew, who had been sent to Canada to escape the London Blitz.CWGC entry Compositions ;Stage * Aladdin, or Love Will Find Out the Way (1931); pantomime * The Pride of the Regiment, or Cashiered for His Country (1932); comic operetta; book by Scobie Mackenzie and V.C.

Tomb of Cardinal di Jorio in Santa Pudenziana, Rome Early life From his earliest years di Jorio was destined for a career in the Roman Curia. He entered the most prestigious of Roman seminaries, the Pontifical Roman Seminary, and after becoming a priest in 1908 soon took up a role as an official in the vicariate of Rome. Despite doing some work as a pastor in Rome, di Jorio was always chiefly concerned with his work in the Vatican bureaucracy, and in 1918 he took up a role as president of the Istituto per le Opere di Religione (\\"Institute of Religious Works\\"). Under the direction of Pope Pius XI, who was eager to settle the \\"Roman Question\\" that had kept the Pope as a \\"prisoner of the Vatican\\" since Italian unification in 1870, di Jorio formed a close association with Bernardino Nogara in the 1920s. After the Lateran Treaty settled the \\"Roman Question\\" and made the Vatican an independent state, di Jorio was chosen by Nogara to run the Vatican Bank, and aided by laws that allowed Nogara to freely buy shares in any company even if it made products contrary to Catholic Church teaching, the Vatican grew immensely wealthy, buying extensively into such wealthy corporations as General Motors, Standard Oil, General Electric and IBM ‚Äì as well as Italgas, the major supplier of gas in Italy at the time. Episcopal career Father di Jorio (later a Monsignor) continued to run the Istituto per le Opere di Religione (and did so until after Vatican II) but he also played many other roles in the Curia during these years, most notably becoming Secretary of the Sacred College of Cardinals in 1947. He was secretary of the conclave during the election of Pope John XXIII, who put his zuchetto on di Jorio's head at the end of the conclave, a traditional promise that he would make di Jorio a cardinal. Six weeks after the conclave, di Jorio was elevated to Cardinal-Deacon of S. Pudenziana in the consistory of 15 December 1958. He was later consecrated Titular Archbishop of Castra Nova on 19 April 1962 when Pope John decreed that all cardinals had to be bishops. He opted for the order of Cardinal-Priests and his deaconry was restored to title on 26 June 1967. Cardinal di Jorio participated in the Second Vatican Council and in the conclave of 1963 that elected Pope Paul VI. Although already seventy-nine at the time, he continued as effective head of the Vatican Bank until 1968. He was prohibited from participating in the two 1978 conclaves because of his age. Upon the death of Jos√© da Costa Nunes on 29 November 1976, di Jorio became the oldest member of the College of Cardinals. Pope Paul VI preached a special homily for him on the seventieth anniversary of his priestly ordination.

Even within the regions of Europe, etiquette may not be uniform: within a single country there may be differences in customs, especially where there are different linguistic groups, as in Switzerland where there are French, German and Italian speakers. Despite this heterogeneity, many points of etiquette have spread through Europe and many features are shared. The ancient Roman Empire is a historical source, and the cosmopolitan royalty and also nobility were effective in spreading etiquette throughout Europe. For example, in the Palace of Versailles, where French nobility was concentrated, a complicated etiquette was developed. Language and forms of address It is never acceptable to write an anonymous letter or one that purports to be signed by somebody other than the writer (but does not make that clear). Many languages use different 2nd person pronouns to denote formality or familiarity when addressing people (the T‚ÄìV distinction). This also applies in common phrases such as \\"How are you?\\".Hervey Sandor, Ian Higgins, Sandor G J Hervey. (2002) Thinking French Translation, Routledge (UK). p. 46. . The use of an inappropriately familiar form may be seen as derogatory, insulting or even aggressive. Conversely, forms that are inappropriately formal may be seen as impolitely snobbishMichel Walter Pharand. (2001) Bernard Shaw and the French, University Press of Florida. p. 113. . or distant. The way politeness is expressed varies greatly with language and region. For example, addressing a person with an honorific or title may be expected in some languages, but seen as intrusive or too formal in others. In many parts of Europe, using someone's first name also denotes a certain level of friendship. In social interactions with strangers, the last name and/or more formal mode of address is used, usually until the people involved agree to move to an informal level. However, this may not apply among young people, among members of particular groups (e.g. students) or in informal settings. Also among countries that border each other vast differences can be noticed in the use of titles, first names and pronounces, as is the case in the Netherlands compared with Belgium and Germany.Cultural Tips Flowers In some countries, such as in Italy, chrysanthemums are given only at funerals. In France, red roses are given to the beloved person when the giver is in love.[Mitschke & Tano (2011). Espaces:Rendez-vous avec le monde francophone. pg.308.] In Finland, the same applies except that school leavers are often given red roses on passing their matriculation examination (abitur).thisisFINLAND: With free, high-quality education for all Hats and coats Among many segments of the European population, for example, in the United Kingdom, it is considered impolite to wear a hat or other head covering indoors, especially in churches, schools, private homes and respected public institutions. In churches, however, ladies are exempt from this rule. Wearing coats, boots or other outer garments inside someone‚Äôs home is often frowned upon as well. Sitting down to eat at table wearing a hat or coat etc. is even worse. Also one should remove one's hat when showing deference. Removing one's hat is also a form of respectful greeting: the origin of this is that knights were expected to remove their helmets when meeting their king; not doing so would be a sign of mistrust and hostility.Turunen, Ari, Partanen, Markus. Uusi ulkokultaisen k√§yt√∂ksen kirja. Atena, Jyv√§skyl√§, 2007. S. 34. Money Talking or asking about one's personal wealth, possessions or success in business is widely viewed as vulgar. People will rarely say how much money they make or have in the bank nor will they request such information from someone else. It is impolite to ask colleagues about their salary and in some places of work it is forbidden.De Belg laat niet graag in zijn loonzakje kijken Even elsewhere, for example where government employees' salaries are publicly known, it is still considered extremely rude to ask individuals how much they earn. Exposure In Europe, what qualifies as indecent exposure includes generally at least the exposure of genitalia or anus. In case of women, exposing nipples is not seen as proper conduct, but this is not always considered criminal, and depends on individual countries' nudity laws. For the issue of breastfeeding babies in public, see Breastfeeding in public. The intentional exposure of bare buttocks towards someone, mooning, is a deliberate insult. However, public nudity may be allowed in some circumstances, which vary by country. Within Dutch society nudity is less sexualized as in for example the English-speaking world and resembles more the views of other Northern European cultures, as can be seen in the sauna customs. In saunas, the rules about nudity vary according to the country. On nudist beaches, unisex saunas and in the changing rooms of swimming pools in some countries, keeping one's clothes on is frowned upon. Here it is good manners to undress.

He was one of the founding fathers of rugby league in Australia, representing the Kangaroos in the first two Tests played in 1908 and 1909. He was the fourth captain of the Australian team enjoying that honour in the deciding Test of the inaugural tour.  Rugby union career  Born in Glebe, New South Wales he played first grade for the district from 1902 and the following year represented Sydney, then New South Wales. He made his Australian representative test debut as prop, against the All Blacks in the 22‚Äì3 victory in Sydney, on 15 August 1903. In 1904 he represented against England then toured New Zealand in 1905. Burdon (back row, 2nd from left) Pioneer Kangaroos 1908-09 Folklore would suggest that Burdon's injury on the 1907 New South Wales Rugby tour of Queensland and the resultant unfairness of him having to pay his medical expenses while suffering a loss of wages, was a catalyst leading to the 1907 split away from rugby union. Similar sentiments in the north of England for working-class players who could not afford time off due to injury had indeed prompted the changes that formed the new \\"Northern Union\\" two years earlier. However the movement to start a rugby league competition in Sydney was already well under way before Burdon's injury.  Rugby league career  Australian Test side v England 6 Jun 1932, Burdon (official) standing far left Burdon joined the newly formed Glebe Rugby League Club in 1908 and was named the club's foundation captain. He was one of the five selectors for the Pioneer Kangaroo tour of England. He played in 25 tour matches including the first and second Anglo-Australian Test matches. Eight former Wallabies had debuted for the Kangaroos in the Matches against New Zealand earlier that year, Burdon's league Test debut in the first Test against England with Pat Walsh made them the 9th and 10th Australian dual code internationals.

History A group of Dominican tertiary nuns, living in a small house in via Santa Chiara where St. Catherine had died, were looking for larger premises. Lead by Porzia Massimo whose late husband was a Conti,Raissa Teodori, Porzia Massimo, in: Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 72 (2008). from 1574 they successively acquired parts of properties belonging to the Conti family at Magnanapoli to establish their convent there, financially assisted by Pope Gregory XIII. The originally small community thrived and quickly expanded from 27 nuns in 1574 to 108 in 1626,Alberto Zucchi, Roma domenicana, note storiche, Florence 1938, pp. 226 ss. many of whom from important noble families. The construction of a church began in 1608, initially at expense of Cardinal Scipione Borghese to a design by Carlo Maderno, but stopped in 1613. Meanwhile, the monastery acquired the Torre delle Milizie in 1619. In 1628, the building of the current church was begun to a design by Giovanni Battista Soria. In 1631 the chancel and two adjacent chapels were completed. Building then came to a halt until the final portion of the church took shape from 1636 and concluded with the facade in 1641. The consecration of the church by cardinal Alessandro Cesarini took place in 1640.According to an inscription in the church below the organ. Another Dominican nuns' convent, Santi Domenico e Sisto, is just a stone's throw away. When the Via Nazionale was laid out in the 19th century, the street level was lowered. This raised the church entrance to a considerable height above the street. To allow access, a double staircase leading to the portico was built. Under the stairs is the entrance to the Crypt of the Fallen, constructed in 1934 and dedicated to the priests who were killed in the First World War. The crypt contains a bronze crucifix by Romano Romanelli. Most of the convent was demolished in 1924. The Military Ordinariate, whose headquarters are adjacent to the church, took over the church, and it is now served by diocesan clergy. A restoration occurred in 1992.

Caterina di Siena col' Monastero delle Monache di S. Domenico a Monte Magnanapoli by Giovanni Battista Falda (1667-1669).png|Engraving of c. 1667-1669 by Giovanni Battista Falda showing the church at the original street level. Interior St Catherine in Ecstasy by Melchiorre Caf√†. The interior is a single nave with a barrel vault and three chapels on each side. The rich decoration, although carried out over a long period of time, appears very homogeneous. Chancel Main altar The massive main altar's architecture to the design of the Maltese sculptor Melchiorre Caf√† is shaped similar to church facades. It creates an elaborate frame for the large marble relief, also by Caf√† and finished by the time of his untimely death in 1667, aged only 31.Gerhard Bissell, Melchiorre Caf√† at S. Caterina a Magnanapoli, in: Keith Scriberras (ed.), Melchiorre Caf√†. Maltese Genius of the Roman Baroque, Valletta (Midsea Books) 2006, pp. 84-88. The relief, St Catherine in Ecstasy, shows the saint in a very indeterminate stance on a cloud pushed by an angel and some putti, all in white marble (some of the flattest parts of the cloud are in plaster). The scene is embedded in an smooth, polychrome background which forms a concave curve through which it underlines the protagonist's statuesque appearance, seemingly detached from it. Its pieces of differently coloured marble are arranged in such a way that they suggest dematerialised dark clouds opening up to let St. Catherine ascend to heaven. With her floatingly light posture and upwards gaze this ascend seems inevitable, she seems to be drawn heavenwards. Caf√†'s work is something new in Roman baroque sculpture. It incorporates lessons learned from Bernini, in particular his Memorial to Maria Raggi (1647) and the Ecstasy of St Theresa (ca. 1652) as well as the use of a polychrome marble background at the relic balconies in the pillars of the crossing of Saint Peter's (1630s). In addition, Caf√† pulls together recently finished or contemporary solutions from within the workshop of Ercole Ferrata of which he himself was an essential part, in particular the Statue of St. Catherine for Siena Cathedral, St. Agnes on a Pyre and the concave shaped relief Martyrdom of Sant'Emerenziana (both in Sant'Agnese in Agone). From these ingredients and his own artistic power, Caf√† produces a highly emotive pictorial solution unseen before, neither neatly definable as a relief nor as a statue nor as a picture. Other works In the chancel's dome are four medallions depicting Dominican saints surrounded by a multitude of putti, all possibly also by Caf√†, and the fresco The Glory of the Eternal Father by Francesco Rosa in the lantern. The decoration of the chancel was completed in the 18th century with the marble reliefs of St Rose of Lima and St Agnes of Montepulciano by Pietro Bracci on the side walls (1755). The tabernacle in the shape of a ciborium, made from lapis lazuli, agate, and gilded bronze, and the high altar on which it sits was designed in 1785 by the architect Carlo Marchionni. Nave and chapels Glory of St. Catherine Fresco in the nave by Luigi Garzi The nave's ceiling fresco, Glory of St. Catherine, one of the masterpieces of Luigi Garzi, shows St. Catherine arriving in heaven and concludes the narrative started by Caf√†. It was first mentioned in 1713 and is retained by some scholars to be from around that period while others date it considerably earlier.Elisa Debenedetti, Garzi, Luigi, in: Allgemeines K√ºnstlerlexikon, vol. 59, de Gruyter, Berlin 2006, p. 496. Garzi had already painted an altarpiece with the subject All Saints in 1674 for the second chapel on the right. This second chapel on the right was decorated in fresco from 1700-1703 by Giuseppe Passeri who also painted two other altar paintings, Three Archangels as well as Madonna of the Rosary. Stefan Albl, Passeri, Giuseppe, in: Allgemeines K√ºnstlerlexikon, vol. 94, de Gruyter, Berlin 2017, p. 400. The latter, one of Passeri's best works, is in the third chapel on the left which also contains the tomb monuments to Giuseppe Bonanni (1648) and Virginia Primi Bonanni (1650) by Giuliano Finelli. In the first chapel on the right, Benedetto Luti painted a fresco of Putti in the ceiling and carried out its altarpiece, Communion of St. Mary Magdalen (1706-1708). Corridor In the corridor leading to the sacristy are remains of frescoes by Antoniazzo Romano which came from the original house of the nuns in via St. Chiara. Some time after 1637 they became part of the room of St. Catherine in the Magnanapoli convent. When this was demolished the frescoes were relocated to this corridor. Among the saints shown are St Bridget of Sweden and St Catherine of Alexandria.

Schmidt was a Moravian missionary to the Kalmyks and devoted much of his labours to Bible translation. Born in Amsterdam, he spent much of his career in St. Petersburg as a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He published the first grammar and dictionary of Mongolian, as well as a grammar and dictionary of Tibetan. He also translated Sanang Sechen's Erdeni-yin tobƒçi into German, and several Geser Khan epics into Russian and German. His works are regarded as ground- breaking for the establishment of Mongolian and Tibetan studies. Early life Schmidt was born into an Amsterdam Moravian family. At the age of six, he was sent to school of the Moravian community in Neuwied. Due to the advance of Napoleon's troops, he returned home in 1791. His family lost all their wealth in an economic crisis following Napoleon's occupation of the Netherlands, but this gave Isaak Jakob Schmidt the impetus to begin a trading apprenticeship and learn several languages. In 1798 he accepted an offer by his church to work at their Sarepta post on the Volga River, emigrated to Russia and adopted Russian citizenship. Research work His work gave Schmidt an opportunity for frequent business contacts with the local Kalmyks, and he eventually learnt both the Kalmyk and the classical Mongolian script. At the same time, he began collecting Kalmyk and Mongolian manuscripts and keeping records on Kalmyk language, religion and history. From 1807 to 1812 Schmidt worked for his church in Saratov. In 1812, he married his wife Helena Wigand. In the same year, his church sent him to Moscow and then to St. Petersburg. Unfortunately, many of his records and collected manuscripts were destroyed in the fire of Moscow of that year. In 1812, Julius Klaproth's Dissertation on language and script of the Uighurs (Abhandlung √ºber die Sprache und Schrift der Uiguren) became the subject of a long-standing dispute. Klaproth asserted that Uighur was a Turkic language, while Schmidt was persuaded that Uighur should be classified as a \\"Tangut\\" language.Walravens, p. 181. In the following years, Schmidt concentrated on translations of the Bible into Kalmyk and Mongolian. His scientific work became noted after the publication of a work on the history of Mongols and Tibetans in 1824. His daughter Emilie was born in 1828. Until his death in 1847, Schmidt published a multitude of works on Mongolian and Tibetan studies, and became a member of a number of different European academic societies.

From The Gambols' inception Appleby received input into creating the strips from his journalist wife Doris \\"Dobs\\" Appleby - she suggested \\"Gambol\\" as the surname of the married couple who are the strip's focus - and from the 1960s Dobs Appleby received official credit for co-writing The Gambols. Social historian David Kynaston has opined that \\"the Gambols [inhabit] a frozen-in-time world closely mirroring the Applebys' own in Kingston-upon-Thames Surrey in the early 1950s\\". The two central characters are George and Gaye Gambol, a happily married, suburban, middle class couple. George is the main breadwinner working as a salesman while Gaye is primarily a housewife, but she does occasionally take on part- time office jobs. The stories revolve around the Gambols' everyday life, in particular Gaye's passion for shopping and George's attempts at home improvements. The couple is childless but, at least once a year, they have their non-sibling nephew and niece: Flivver and Miggy, stay with them. Originally The Gambols appeared three times a week formatted as a strip of three or four panels, and three times in single panel format. As of 4 June 1951 - when paper rationing officially ended - The Gambols was featured daily in multi-panel format, and as of 1956 an extended three row strip was prepped for the Sunday Express. Some of the strips also appeared in colour. After Dobs' death in 1985, Barry Appleby continued with the strip alone until his own death in 1996. The strip was then taken over by Appleby's longtime associate Roger Mahoney.. In November 1999 the Express canceled The Gambols with the Express running an intended final strip showing George and Gaye - along with Flivver and Miggy - evidently preparing to journey on in the family car.Mail on Sunday 26 December 1999 However the strip was picked up as of December 1999 by the Mail on Sunday for whom Mahoney has been drawing The Gambols ever since.

He moved to Chelsea in 1936 for ¬£4166 and was at the club to 1945 although his career was interrupted by the Second World War. During the conflict he was a regular guest player for Leeds United during the 1942‚Äì43 season. He left Chelsea in December 1945 for Stockport County and retired in the 1947 close season. As a player Weaver was noted not only for aggression but also for his long throw-ins which reached up to 35 yards in length. Coaching Following his retirement Weaver returned to Leeds to join the coaching staff. He left the club in June 1949 to take up a similar role at Millwall and remained in this position until January 1954. After a spell out of the game Weaver took on the role of coach at Mansfield Town in September 1955 before being promoted to the role of manager in June 1958 in succession to Charlie Mitten. He was dismissed in January 1960 during a season in which Mansfield were relegated from the Football League Third Division. Following the appointment of Raich Carter as his successor Weaver made a surprise return to Mansfield the following month after Carter offered him the position of assistant trainer. Weaver continued in this role under Tommy Cummings before being made chief scout under Tommy Eggleston, a role in which he remained until he retired from football. Cricket Alongside his football career Weaver also played first-class cricket for Somerset County Cricket Club and was masseur to the club from 1956.

It normally is a Type I gas clathrate. There has also been some experimental evidence for the development of a metastable Type II phase at A temperature near the ice melting point. The clathrate can exist below 283K (10 ¬∞C) at a range of pressures of carbon dioxide. CO2 hydrates are widely studied around the world due to its promising prospects of carbon dioxide capture from flue gas and fuel gas streams relevant to post-combustion and pre-combustion capture. It is also quite likely to be important on Mars due to the presence of carbon dioxide and ice at low temperatures.  History  The first evidence for the existence of CO2 hydrates dates back to the year 1882, when Zygmunt Florenty Wr√≥blewski reported clathrate formation while studying carbonic acid. He noted that gas hydrate was a white material resembling snow, and could be formed by raising the pressure above a certain limit in his H2O - CO2 system. He was the first to estimate the CO2 hydrate composition, finding it to be approximately CO2‚Ä¢8H2O. He also mentions that \\"...the hydrate is only formed either on the walls of the tube, where the water layer is extremely thin or on the free water surface... (from French)\\" This already indicates the importance of the surface available for reaction (i.e. the larger the surface the better). Later on, in 1894, M. P. Villard deduced the hydrate composition as CO2‚Ä¢6H2O. Three years later, he published the hydrate dissociation curve in the range 267 K to 283 K (-6 to 10¬∞C). Tamman & Krige measured the hydrate decomposition curve from 253 K down to 230 K in 1925 and Frost & Deaton (1946) determined the dissociation pressure between 273 and 283 K (0 and 10¬∞C). Takenouchi & Kennedy (1965) measured the decomposition curve from 45 bars up to 2 kbar (4.5 to 200 MPa). The CO2 hydrate was classified as a Type I clathrate for the first time by von Stackelberg & Muller (1954).  Importance  Earth In this mosaic taken by the Mars Global Surveyor: Aram Chaos - top left and Iani Chaos - bottom right. A river-bed-like outflow channel can be seen, originating from Iani Chaos and extending towards the top of the image. On Earth, CO2 hydrate is mostly of academic interest. Tim Collett of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) proposed pumping carbon dioxide into subsurface methane clathrates, thereby releasing the methane and storing the carbon dioxide. As of 2009, ConocoPhillips is working on a trial on the Alaska North Slope with the US Department of Energy to release methane in this way. At first glance, it seems that the thermodynamic conditions there favor the existence of hydrates, yet given that the pressure is created by sea water rather than by CO2, the hydrate will decompose. Mars However, it is believed that CO2 clathrate might be of significant importance for planetology. CO2 is an abundant volatile on Mars. It dominates in the atmosphere and covers its polar ice caps much of the time. In the early seventies, the possible existence of CO2 hydrates on Mars was proposed. Recent consideration of the temperature and pressure of the regolith and of the thermally insulating properties of dry ice and CO2 clathrate suggested that dry ice, CO2 clathrate, liquid CO2, and carbonated groundwater are common phases, even at Martian temperatures. If CO2 hydrates are present in the Martian polar caps, as some authors suggest, then the polar cap can potentially melt at depth. Melting of the polar cap would not be possible if it was composed entirely of pure water ice (Mellon et al. 1996). This is because of the clathrate‚Äôs lower thermal conductivity, higher stability under pressure, and higher strength, as compared to pure water ice. The question of a possible diurnal and annual CO2 hydrate cycle on Mars remains, since the large temperature amplitudes observed there cause exiting and reentering the clathrate stability field on a daily and seasonal basis. The question is, then, can gas hydrate being deposited on the surface be detected by any means? The OMEGA spectrometer on board Mars Express returned some data, which were used by the OMEGA team to produce CO2 and H2O-based images of the South polar cap. No definitive answer has been rendered with respect to Martian CO2 clathrate formation. The decomposition of CO2 hydrate is believed to play a significant role in the terraforming processes on Mars, and many of the observed surface features are partly attributed to it. For instance, Musselwhite et al. (2001) argued that the Martian gullies had been formed not by liquid water but by liquid CO2, since the present Martian climate does not allow liquid water existence on the surface in general. This is especially true in the southern hemisphere, where most of the gully structures occur. However, water can be present there as ice Ih, CO2 hydrates or hydrates of other gases. All these can be melted under certain conditions and result in gully formation. There might also be liquid water at depths >2 km under the surface (see geotherms in the phase diagram). It is believed that the melting of ground-ice by high heat fluxes formed the Martian chaotic terrains. Milton (1974) suggested the decomposition of CO2 clathrate caused rapid water outflows and formation of chaotic terrains. Cabrol et al. (1998) proposed that the physical environment and the morphology of the south polar domes on Mars suggest possible cryovolcanism. The surveyed region consisted of 1.5 km-thick-layered deposits covered seasonally by CO2 frost underlain by H2O ice and CO2 hydrate at depths > 10 m. When the pressure and the temperature are raised above the stability limit, clathrate is decomposed into ice and gases, resulting in explosive eruptions. Still a lot more examples of the possible importance of the CO2 hydrate on Mars can be given. One thing remains unclear: is it really possible to form hydrate there? Kieffer (2000) suggests no significant amount of clathrates could exist near the surface of Mars. Stewart & Nimmo (2002) find it is extremely unlikely that CO2 clathrate is present in the Martian regolith in quantities that would affect surface modification processes. They argue that long term storage of CO2 hydrate in the crust, hypothetically formed in an ancient warmer climate, is limited by the removal rates in the present climate. Baker et al. 1991 suggests that, if not today, at least in the early Martian geologic history the clathrates may have played an important role for the climate changes there. Since not too much is known about the CO2 hydrates formation and decomposition kinetics, or their physical and structural properties, it becomes clear that all the above- mentioned speculations rest on extremely unstable bases. Moons On Enceladus decomposition of carbon dioxide clathrate is a possible way to explain the formation of gas plumes. In Europa (moon), clathrate should be important for storing carbon dioxide. In the conditions of the subsurface ocean in Europa, carbon dioxide clathrate should sink, and therefore not be apparent at the surface.  Phase diagram  CO2 hydrate phase diagram. The black squares show experimental data. The lines of the CO2 phase boundaries are calculated according to the Intern. thermodyn. tables (1976). The H2O phase boundaries are only guides to the eye. The abbreviations are as follows: L - liquid, V - vapor, S - solid, I - water ice, H - hydrate. The hydrate structures are stable at different pressure-temperature conditions depending on the guest molecule. Here is given one Mars-related phase diagram of CO2 hydrate, combined with those of pure CO2 and water. CO2 hydrate has two quadruple points: (I-Lw-H-V) (T = 273.1 K; p = 12.56 bar or 1.256 MPa) and (Lw-H-V-LHC) (T = 283.0 K; p = 44.99 bar or 4.499 MPa). CO2 itself has a triple point at T = 216.58 K and p = 5.185 bar (518.5 kPa) and a critical point at T = 304.2 K and p = 73.858 bar (7.3858 MPa). The dark gray region (V-I-H) represents the conditions at which CO2 hydrate is stable together with gaseous CO2 and water ice (below 273.15 K). On the horizontal axes the temperature is given in kelvins and degrees Celsius (bottom and top respectively). On the vertical ones are given the pressure (left) and the estimated depth in the Martian regolith (right). The horizontal dashed line at zero depth represents the average Martian surface conditions. The two bent dashed lines show two theoretical Martian geotherms after Stewart & Nimmo (2002) at 30¬∞ and 70¬∞ latitude.

Self-destructive behaviors have been shown by many people throughout the years. It is on a continuum, with one extreme end of the scale being suicide. Self-destructive actions may be deliberate, born of impulse, or developed as a habit. The term however tends to be applied toward self-destruction that either is fatal, or is potentially habit-forming or addictive and thus potentially fatal. Self- destructive behavior is often associated with mental illnesses such as borderline personality disorderAnthony W. Bateman, Roy Krawitz (2013). Borderline Personality Disorder: An evidence-based guide for generalist mental health professionals. OUP Oxford, or schizophrenia. Origin Self- destructive behavior was first studied in 1895 by Freud and Ferenczi when they first recognized how traumatic experiences affected the development of children. Freud and Ferenczi noticed that children who were raised in an unhealthy environment were more often the ones to act out and take part in self-destructive behavior. Freud concluded that self-destructive behavior is influenced by one's ego or superego and aggression. Depending on how strongly influenced one is, it will increase the intensity of one‚Äôs destructive behavior. Guilt is a leading factor for one's superego. For instance, growing up with alcoholic parents can increase one‚Äôs self-destructive behavior because they feel guilty that they didn't provide them with the help they needed. Since they failed to help their parents overcome these obstacles, they feel as if their parents failed because of them. Then, they use harming themselves as a coping mechanism to their guilt and failure. Freud additionally states that the aggression in self-destructive behavior is influenced by a personal motive. Just as cultural and environmental factors can play an important role of this, social factors can as well. For example, say a child was bullied all through middle school, the way to get rid of his pain the child would take action in self-destructive behavior, such as self-harm or yelling. With investigations Freud and Ferenczi formed a hypothesis that people with self- destructive behavior suffer from \\"forbidden fantasies, not memories,\\" meaning that since the action isn't supposed to be done, self-destructive people get a stronger drive to take part in these actions. Self-destructive behavior comes in many different forms that varies from person to person. Therefore, superego and aggression is different in every person. Types of self-destructive behavior * Suicide * Self-harm * Eating disorders * Substance abuse Forms Self-destructive behavior may be used as a coping mechanism when one is overwhelmed. For example, faced with a pressing scholastic assessment, someone may choose to sabotage their work rather than cope with the stress. This would make submission of (or passing) the assessment impossible, but remove the worry associated with it. Self-destructive behavior may also manifest itself in an active attempt to drive away other people. For example, they may fear that they will \\"mess up\\" a relationship. Rather than deal with this fear, socially self-destructive individuals engage in annoying or alienating behavior, so that others will reject them first. More obvious forms of self-destruction are eating disorders, alcohol abuse, drug addictions, sex addiction, self-injury, and suicide attempts. An important aspect of self-destructive behavior is the inability to handle the stress stemming from an individual's lack of self-confidence ‚Äì for example in a relationship, whether the other person is truly faithful (\\"how can they love someone like me?\\"); at work or school, whether the realization of assignments and deadlines is possible (\\"there is no way I can complete all my work on time\\"). Self-destructive people usually lack healthier coping mechanisms, like asserting personal boundaries. As a result, they tend to feel that showing they are incompetent is the only way to untangle themselves from demands. Successful individuals may self-destructively sabotage their own achievements; this may stem from a feeling of anxiety, unworthiness, or from an impulsive desire to repeat the \\"climb to the top.\\" Self-destructive behavior is often considered to be synonymous with self-harm, but this is not accurate. Self- harm is an extreme form of self-destructive behavior, but it may appear in many other guises. Just as personal experience can affect how extreme ones self-destructive behavior is, self-harm reflects this. Overall, personal experience and mental health problems is what effects self-harm. Causes Childhood trauma via sexual and physical abuse, as well as disrupted parental care, have been linked with self-destructive behavior. Usually, behavior like this results from the lack of realization of healthy coping mechanisms. Because there's not a lot of focus on specific mental health problems, such as self-destructive behavior, people aren't being educated on specific ways that could benefit or even prevent these people from acting out. Additionally, people who have experienced some form of childhood trauma, such as abuse or neglect, can develop psychological issues that can lead to bigger problems. Aside from this, a need for attention or a feel good sensation can ultimately cause this behavior. A prime example of this would be addiction to drugs or alcohol. In the beginning stages, people have the tendency to ease their way into these unhealthy behaviors because it gives them a pleasurable sensation. However, as time goes on, it becomes a habit that they can not stop and they begin to lose these great feelings easily. When these feelings stop, self- destructive behavior enhances because they aren't able to provide themselves with that feeling that makes mental or physical pain go away. Stages of Change Changing ones self-destructive behavior can be difficult, and may include major stages that one passes through on the way to recovery. The stages founded by Prochaska and DiClemente in 1982 included precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance, and termination.

He was the scion of a pharmacist clan in Piatra Neam»õ, but abandoned the family trade to take up drawing, and became a student at Munich's Academy of Fine Arts. Praised as an intellectual as well as a painter, he moved away from Art Nouveau, studying Cubism and Expressionism, and exchanging ideas with a young Marcel Duchamp. Vorel also worked as a cartoonist for Der Komet magazine, befriending Albert Bloch, Hanns Bolz and Erich M√ºhsam, and frequenting Caf√© Stefanie. While active in immediate proximity to the early trends in German Expressionism, including Der Blaue Reiter, he never joined any artistic society. His avant-garde paintings, which often incorporated social commentary, alternated with more subdued and conventional landscapes and peasant portraits of Western Moldavia. Maintaining some interest in Romania's modern art scene, he was featured at Tinerimea ArtisticƒÉ shows and published sketch stories in Bucharest's literary magazines. Ailing from a chronic kidney disease, Vorel lived a withdrawn existence during World War I. He maintained a lively interest in politics and military developments, expressing his continued support for the Central Powers; he was also increasingly pessimistic about the future of art, and about his own ability to thrive. This period brought him into contact with Romanian writer Nae Ionescu, who was his admirer and promoter, but Vorel's notebooks suggest that their friendship was superficial. Briefly interned as a hostile alien, Vorel turned to pacifism during his final years, ultimately dying in Munich at age 38. He remains celebrated in Piatra Neam»õ, where some of his diaries have been published, but is relatively unknown in Romania at large. Biography Youth and formation Born to Czech-Romanian parents in Ia»ôi, LascƒÉr was the great- grandson of Anton Vorel, a well-known pharmacist and herbalist who had arrived in Moldavia from the Kingdom of Bohemia.Verzea (2018), p. 70 Mia Vorel, Corina Pavel, \\"Destine.

LascƒÉr was the only one of his family not to be interested in pharmacy.Verzea (2018), p. 71 Later in life, being almost entirely reliant on his family's financial support, he acknowledged that his pursuits were \\"anti-economical\\", that to society he appeared as an \\"infirm\\". However, he took pride in noting that his art was without \\"commercial sense\\".Verzea (2014), pp. 80‚Äì82 As he recalled in adulthood, his passion for drawing was first cultivated during his time at the Boys' School in Piatra, and was picked up from a talented schoolmate, MƒÉrgƒÉrint, \\"my first and final master\\".

From that moment on, Vorel developed a style influenced by the Vienna Secession and other branches of Art Nouveau,Grigorescu (1980), p. 438 sending some of his works to be displayed by Tinerimea ArtisticƒÉ, the Secession's equivalent in Bucharest.Dumitru Iov, \\"Cronici.

One of Vorel's early admirers was journalist-philosopher Nae Ionescu, who discovered his \\"surprising newness and high intellectualism\\", viewing his \\"tormented\\" art as a record of Vorel's own existential struggles. Overall, Ionescu argues, Vorel was \\"one of the most exquisite exemplars of Romanian spirituality.\\"Nicolae, pp. 61‚Äì62 As noted by critic Valentin CiucƒÉ, Vorel was both a shy man with a \\"complex interior life\\" and a modernizer, \\"interested in artistic synchronism, with all newness that existed in art at the start of the century.\\" Another critic, Petru Comarnescu, argues that Vorel was above all an \\"intellectual painter\\" with a \\"tragic sense of self.\\"Verzea (2014), p. 79 & (2018), p. 71 In addition to painting and drawing, he was a published writer of sketch stories. These include MƒÉestrul meu (\\"My Masterful\\"), taken up by Via»õa LiterarƒÉ »ôi ArtisticƒÉ journal (1908), as well as a series in Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ (1913). According to Ionescu, this literary production had \\"vanished\\" from public memory within a decade.Nicolae, pp. 62, 64 In 1908‚Äì1909, Vorel became interested in Expressionism while attending exhibits of works by Vincent van Gogh, Paul C√©zanne, and Henri Matisse. His artistic vision fully incorporated C√©zanne's geometrical guidelines,Grigorescu (1970), pp. 216, 217 resulting in what writer Dumitru Iov viewed as \\"moderate cubism\\". Also according to Iov, Vorel was masterful in his 1914 canvass The Card Players. By then, Vorel was in contact with Albert Bloch, an American member of Der Blaue Reiter. In 1910‚Äì1912 Vorel, Bloch and Hanns Bolz worked as cartoonists for a satirical magazine, Der Komet, which was probably conceived of in Munich's Caf√© Stefanie; the editor was anarchist writer Erich M√ºhsam, who regularly played chess with Vorel.Baron, pp. 11, 14‚Äì15, 19 It was as a result of Vorel's intercession that Der Komet also published cartoons by another Romanian, Nicolae Mantu.Corneliu Stoica, \\"Dic»õionar ‚Äì Arti»ôti plastici gƒÉlƒÉ»õeni (65). Mantu, Nicolae\\", in DunƒÉrea de Jos, Issue 129, November 2012, p. 41 Vorel was at the time dating cabaret singer Maria \\"Mucki\\" Berger (or Berg√©).Baron, p. 15 In these circles, Vorel also met Marcel Duchamp, who lived close to his home on Bl√ºtenstrasse. This encounter, mediated by painter Max Bergmann, may have helped to radicalize Duchamp's vision on art.Baron, pp. 11‚Äì12, 15 Later in the 1910s, Bloch and Vorel were close friends; they visited each other's studios and drew portraits of one other.Baron, pp. 8, 12‚Äì13, 29 Although Vorel ultimately refused to join any particular group of artists, his work shares common traits with that of several German Expressionists‚Äîincluding George GroszGrigorescu (1970), pp. 216‚Äì217 & (1980) pp. 438‚Äì439 and Oskar Kokoschka.Nicolae, p. 63 Many of his paintings are satirical in theme, and center on grotesque caricatures of bourgeois society or its entertainers.Grigorescu (1970), pp. 216, 217 & (1980), pp. 438‚Äì439 Most of them are painted in gouache, and are dominated by blue, grey, and violet tones.Grigorescu (1970), p. 217 His main stylistic choice was contrasted by works depicting his home region: concentrating on wider compositions and landscapes which included more emotional portraits of peasants and artisans, he made use of lighter tones of color.Constantin DƒÉnciuloiu, \\"Expozi»õia de picturƒÉ\\", in Av√¢ntul, Issue 175/1939, pp. 1‚Äì2Grigorescu (1970), p. 217 & (1980), p. 439 Journalist Constantin DƒÉnciuloiu found these works to be reminiscent of two classical painters, Jean-Baptiste Greuze and Nicolae Grigorescu. Final years Ionescu finally met Vorel in person during early 1914; the two men were possibly reunited in the first half of 1916, which is probably the time-frame for Vorel's only portrait of Ionescu.Nicolae, pp. 63‚Äì65 He described the painter as having an \\"enormous forehead\\", \\"seemingly ready to burst open from the painful pressure of a lingering thought.\\" This self-reflection was \\"sadistic\\", because Vorel was always returning to the same conclusion: that old creative forms were no longer sufficient to the modern mindset.Nicolae, p. 62 After watching Vorel work on his canvasses, Ionescu proposed that his was not painting as much as a \\"problem-solving\\" activity. Vorel's private papers document his bouts of anger and depression; in 1915, he described his trade as a form of \\"clowning around\\", noting that, at any moment, \\"hell can reign upon my dwarfish life\\".Verzea (2014), pp. 87‚Äì88 & (2018), p. 71 He noted that \\"desperate\\" work was his only method of fending off uncertainty and isolation, but also that the canvasses he still sent to be exhibited by Tinerimea were purposefully sketch-like or unfinished.Verzea (2014), pp. 79, 91‚Äì92, 96‚Äì97 Ionescu reports that Vorel consulted the Tinerimea catalogue during a regular meeting at Caf√© Stefanie‚Äîpassing it around to his German colleagues, including Bloch, Bolz, Franz Marc, and Frank Wedekind. Almost all were reportedly impressed with one work by Ion Theodorescu-Sion.Nicolae, pp. 62‚Äì63 Upon the outbreak of World War I, Vorel became an enthusiastic supporter of his adoptive Germany and of the Central Powers in general. In his private correspondence, he argued that Germans were \\"called upon to rule over the world\\", being especially impressed by Germany's submarine tactics.Verzea (2014), pp. 87‚Äì92 & (2018), pp. 71‚Äì72 Vorel commented that peaceful civilization was illusory, and that hatred was the \\"fundamental habitus of living creatures\\".Verzea (2014), p. 101 He also equated a German victory with the onset of modernization, leading to a \\"massive output of creative energy\\".Verzea (2014), p. 92 & (2018), p. 72 While Romania still kept neutral, Vorel derided its pro-Allied agitators, including Octavian Goga and Ioan Toplicescu, endorsing instead the pro-German Petre P. Carp. As he noted in June 1915, Carp's newspaper Moldova was the only thing worth reading.Verzea (2014), pp. 91, 94‚Äì95 & (2018), pp. 72‚Äì73 By April 1916, Ionescu was asking Vorel to consider publishing more literary contributions in Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ. One of the artist's private records suggests that he and Mucki were growing disappointed with \\"our pal I.\\"‚Äîperhaps the same Ionescu‚Äî, who would feign sickness to demand money from the cash-strapped couple.Nicolae, pp. 64‚Äì65 Battling a chronic disease of the kidneys, Vorel followed \\"a strict diet and a sedentary regimen.\\"Verzea (2014), pp. 89‚Äì91, 94, 102‚Äì103 & (2018), pp. 71, 73 During early 1916, he complained that \\"my old sore in the loins\\" was giving him problems in the left ear, and seemingly pushing him into deafness. He was also demanding that his family send him more money to pay for a temporary retreat to the countryside, but noted that he was still working on his circus-themed canvasses.Verzea (2014), pp. 102‚Äì103 Partly prepared by Bloch,Baron, p. 12 his last exhibit came during summer 1916, at a Munch venue he shared with Erich Heckel.Nicolae, pp. 63, 65; Verzea (2018), p. 71 Vorel wrote home to announce that he was engaged to Mucki.Verzea (2014), p. 106 The historical context for both these events proved challenging, since, at roughly the same time, Romania was mobilizing to declare war on the Central Powers. Vorel was angered when announcements for his exhibit introduced him as \\"the Romanian LascƒÉr Vorel\\", noting: \\"this highlighting of my nationality can't possibly serve me in the present circumstances\\".Nicolae, p. 65 Bunescu recalls that the Romanian engagement resulted in Vorel's internment as a hostile foreigner, which \\"shortened his lifespan\\". From 1917, he was reunited with Bolz, who had been injured during a chemical attack and was recovering in Munich.Baron, p. 14 By then, Vorel had incorporated pacifist protests into his paintings. This was the last major subject of his art. His death occurred on February 8, 1918 at Munich, and was a consequence of his kidney disease.Baron, p. 13; Verzea (2018), p. 71 Bloch mourned his death in a sonnet, which describes the event as being \\"without farewell or warning\\", suggesting that Vorel had purposefully isolated himself from his friends.Baron, pp. 12‚Äì13 He bought and took back to America several of Vorel's Munich cityscapes; one is at the Spencer Museum of Art.Baron, p. 13 The artist's remains were incinerated and then buried at Eternitatea Cemetery in Piatra. His diaries were also recovered, and are preserved in the Piatra Neam»õ Museum of History archives. In October 1924, Ionescu sought to revived interest in Vorel's work with a tribute piece in Cuv√¢ntul daily. It urged Bunescu, by then an official painter, to organize a Vorel posthumous exhibit, since \\"nobody knows his paintings, and that's a shame.\\" In 1939, the Social Service of the National Renaissance Front sponsored a retrospective of Vorel's Romanian works, hosted by Piatra's Petru Rare»ô National College. Vorel's brothers were the last generation to own the Vorel pharmacy practice before its nationalization by the communist regime; several members of the family spent time in communist prisons during the 1950s, although Tudor was kept as factory manager. In 1958 the regime allowed a Vorel exhibition to be hosted by a Bucharest gallery. The family's contribution was again recognized from 1983, when a pharmaceutical company took the name Plantavorel. Since 1993, Piatra Neam»õ hosts a LascƒÉr Vorel Gallery (part of the Neam»õ County Museum Complex). It is the center of a \\"Vorel Biennale\\" exhibiting works by contemporary painters. A sample from the paitner's diaries, covering the year 1916, appeared at Piatra in 2009.Nicolae, p. 64 Commemorating 100 years since Vorel's death, the Asachi Library of Ia»ôi noted that, though an \\"innovator of art in Romania, as well as worldwide\\", Vorel remained \\"quite unfamiliar to art lovers\\".

Life  Early life and marriage Philippa was born in approximately 1073 to Count William IV of Toulouse, and his wife Emma of Mortain. She was his only surviving child, and thus, by the laws of Toulouse, his heir. In 1088, William went on a pilgrimage to Palestine, leaving his brother Raymond of Saint-Gilles as regent. (Before he left, it is claimed, he also married his daughter to the King of Aragon in order to disinherit her; however, this marriage is apocryphal, as contemporary evidence shows that Sancho was still married to his previous wife at the time of his death in 1094.)Szabolcs de VAJAY, \\"Ramire II le Moine, roi d'Aragon et Agnes de Poitou dans l'histoire et la l√©gende\\", in M√©langes offerts √† Ren√© Crozet, 2 vol, Poitiers, 1966, vol 2, p 727-750; and Ruth E Harvey, \\"The wives of the first troubadour Duke William IX of Aquitaine\\", in Journal of Medieval History, vol 19, 1993, p 315. Harvey states that, contrary to prior assumptions, William IX was certainly Philippa of Toulouse's only husband. Vajay states that the marriage to an unnamed king of Aragon reported by a non-contemporary chronicler is imaginary even though it has appeared broadly in modern histories, and likewise he cites J de Salarrullana de Dios, Documentos correspondientes al reinado de Sancho Ramirez, Saragossa, 1907, vol I, nr 51, p 204-207 to document that Sancho's wife Felicie was clearly still married to him just months before his death, making the marriage to Philippa several years earlier, as reported in several modern popular biographies of her granddaughter, completely unsupportable. Philippa's early life ‚Äì if she was not married to Sancho Ramirez of Aragon ‚Äì is something of a mystery. It is known that she did not marry William IX of Aquitaine until 1094, after the death of her father and the succession of her uncle; the circumstances in which she lived prior to her father's death, the manner of her disinheritance, and the arrangement of her marriage, are thus unknown. Those historians that argue her to have been married to Sancho Ramirez argue that her removal from Toulouse prevented her from effectively claiming her inheritance, and that with the death of Sancho, she was free to remarry based on her own choice. What is certain is that, upon the death of Count William, Philippa's claims were ignored, and Raymond became count. Political life When Raymond IV of Toulouse set out on the First Crusade in the autumn of 1096, he left his son Bertrand to rule the County. However, in the spring of 1098, William and Philippa marched into the city of Toulouse, and took control without a single life being lost. In the next year, she gave birth to her first child in the city: William the Toulousain. In 1099, her husband went on crusade and he left her as regent in Poitou. She was an admirer of Robert of Arbrissel and persuaded her husband to grant him land in Poitou to establish a religious community dedicated to the Virgin Mary. In 1100 he founded Fontevraud Abbey there. She was stunned in 1100 when her husband mortgaged Toulouse to her cousin Bertrand in exchange for a vast sum of money, which the Duke used to go on Crusade himself. Philippa, removed from her home, was sent to his capital of Poitiers, from where she ruled Aquitaine on behalf of her husband whilst he was absent. After William's return, he and Philippa for a time lived contentedly with each other, producing a further five daughters, and a son, Raymond. She also ignored the Duke's sexual boasting in song and talk, instead concentrating on religion (in particular the Abbey of Fontevrault, of which she remained a keen sponsor), especially the teachings of its founder, who preached the superiority of women over men. Her obsession with a doctrine considered offensive by many men of that time, combined with William's growing dissatisfaction with her, and his teasing of her (claiming to be founding an abbey of prostitutes), led to discord in the marriage. Toulouse had been won back by William for his wife in 1113, following the death of Bertrand in Syria in 1112: his heir being his half- brother, the 9 year old Alphonse-Jourdain, William had been unopposed. Thus, by 1114, Philippa was spending most of her time ruling there. Accordingly, she was less than pleased when, upon her return from Toulouse to Poitiers in 1114, she discovered her husband to have moved his mistress, Viscountess Dangereuse of Ch√¢tellerault, into her palace. Philippa appealed to friends and the church for assistance in ousting her husband's mistress, but to no avail ‚Äì none could persuade the Duke to give up his mistress. Later life In 1116, a humiliated Philippa, devastated by her husband's repayment of her service to him for so many years, left the Court, taking refuge at the Abbey of Fontevrault. There she became a close friend of her husband's first wife, Ermengarde of Anjou, and the two spent much time reflecting upon the shortcomings of William. However, for all Philippa's devotion to the Abbey and its ideals, she found little peace there, both angry and resentful that her husband had cast her off in favour of a mistress. She died of unknown causes there on 28 November 1118, survived by her husband, his mistress, and Ermengarde, who would shortly attempt to avenge Philippa by attempting to have Dangereuse banished from Aquitaine.

Its main lines of business are vehicle and home insurance, with a range of supplementary products such as breakdown cover, legal protection and personal accident cover. In 2013 it added life insurance through the Beagle Street brand. History The company was founded in 1992 by Douw Steyn as the Budget Insurance Company, an underwriter. Budget Insurance Services was founded in 1997 and the following year Budget Insurance Company ceased underwriting and became an intermediary business, marketing policies underwritten by a panel of insurers. In 1999 it acquired Arnott Century, and changed its name to Budget Retail. The group acquired Dial Direct and Bennetts in 2001. In 2002 it launched an affinity business, called Junction which was a major contributor to its growth through partners such as Post Office, M&S; Money, Bradford & Bingley, and Yes Insurance. In 2003, the company launched its own uninsured loss recovery business, ACM ULR, and in the same year it ran a PR and marketing campaign for Bennetts, helping to establish the bike insurer as a leading brand in the UK market. In 2004, Budget was noted as providing the most competitive home insurance, and the cheapest motor insurance cover. The company opened its Cape Town Contact Centre in 2004, set up Comparethemarket.com as a complimentary service in 2005, and sold Budget Retail in 2006. In July 2007 the company changed its name to BGL Group, launching an eco-friendly car insurance site, ibuyeco.co.uk, and relaunching the comparethemarket.com insurance price comparison site. The year 2009 saw the creation of comparethemeerkat.com ‚Äì online meerkat comparison website as part of a spoof advertising campaign featuring a CGI meerkat character named Aleksandr Orlov. French price comparison sites LesFurets.com and CreditMieux.com were acquired in 2010, and Dutch site Verzekeringssite.nl was acquired in 2012. The latter was rebranded as hoyhoy.nl in 2014. In 2013, BGL group launched Beagle Street, the first online-only life insurer in the UK. In 2015, Bennetts was sold to Saga Group. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board acquired a 30% stake in BGL in 17 November for ¬£675 million.

The fell is often climbed by walkers on their way to the summit of Skiddaw, the route up the north west ridge which passes over Long Side is regarded as being the finest and quietest ascent of that mountain by guide book writers. Topography Long Side falls away steeply on its south western flank towards Bassenthwaite Lake, these slopes are clothed in the coniferous woodlands of Longside Wood below the 400 metre contour. To the north west the fell descends in steep broken crags to the quiet and unfrequented valley of Southerndale. To the north west the fell connects to the adjacent fell of Ullock Pike by a path that runs for 600 metres along the rim of Longside Edge. To the south east the edge continues from Long Side to link to the higher fell of Carl Side, 800 metres distant. Geology In common with much of the Northern Fells the Kirk Stile Formation of the Skiddaw Group predominates. This is composed of laminated mudstone and siltstone with greywacke sandstone and is of Ordovician age.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) Ascents As mentioned ascents of Long Side are often done by walkers en route to Skiddaw, this route starts at the Ravenstone Hotel on the A591 (grid reference ) and climbs Ullock Pike first by its northern ridge before continuing along Longside Edge to the summit of Long Side. The route to Skiddaw keeps on the ridge to Carl Side before ascending a steep loose path through the scree to the summit of Skiddaw. A direct ascent of Long Side is possible from the Old Sawmill car park (grid reference ) on the A591 using the Forestry Commission way marked trail to find a way through Longside Wood to the open fell and then ascending the steep fell side to the summit. Summit The summit is marked by a pile of stones. There is a fine view of Bassenthwaite lake. To the east Skiddaw is seen as a massive bulk blocking out much of the view in that direction.

It is known for the Buddhist temple built on the banks of the Kelani River, which runs through the suburb. It is also a religious centre for veneration of the figures, Vibhishana and Avalokiteshvara.  Historical and cultural significance Kelaniya (Kalyanam) is mentioned in Ramayana and in the Buddhist chronicle, the Mahawansa which states that the Gautama Buddha (5th century BC) visited the place, after which the dagaba of the temple was built.Wilhelm Geiger (Tr), The Mahavansa, or The Great Chronicle of Ceylon, Oxford, OUP, 1920. The suburb is also of historical importance as the capital of a provincial king Kelani Tissa (1st century BC) whose daughter, Viharamahadevi was the mother of king Dutugemunu the great, regarded as the most illustrious of the 186 or so kings of Sri Lanka between the 5th century BC and 1815. Sri Lankan Buddhists believe that the Buddha visited Kelaniya in order to quell a quarrel between the NƒÅga leaders of two warring factions: Chulodara (literally \\"the small-bellied one\\") and Mahodara (literally \\"the big-bellied one\\"). They were quarrelling over a jewel-encrusted throne. After the Buddha showed them the futility of their quarrel they converted to Buddhism and together offered the throne to the Buddha. It is believed that the Dagaba (Sthupa or Buddhist temple) seen today was built with the throne as a relic inside. Sculpture of Kelaniya Temple. Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara has become famous because of the beautiful paintings and sculpture by Solias Mendis depicting various events in the history of Sri Lanka. Thousands of Buddhists come to see the Buddhist pageant of Kelaniya, popularly referred to as Duruthu Maha Perahera of Kelaniya in the month of January every year. According to Ramayana, after King Ravana‚Äôs death, Vibeeshana was crowned as the King of Lanka by Lakshmana at Kelaniya. There are murals enshrined outside the Buddhist temple depicting the crowning of Vibeeshana. The Kelani River is mentioned in the Valmiki Ramayana and Vibeeshana palace was said to be on the banks of this river. The reason Lakshmana crowned Vibeeshana, was because Rama had to return to India as he had to continue his self-exile of fourteen years to honour the commitment to his father, King Dasarath of Ayodhya. Transport The A1 highway connecting Colombo with Kandy runs along this suburb. The Kelaniya Railway Station is located close to the Colombo-Kandy Road and provides rail connections with the rest of the country. Education The University of Kelaniya is situated at Kelaniya near the Colombo-Kandy Road. Gurukula College is the one of best schools in Kelaniya.

'Prospector' was introduced to the UK in 2009, by Hampshire & Isle of Wight Branch, Butterfly Conservation, as part of an assessment of DED- resistant cultivars as potential hosts of the endangered White-letter Hairstreak. Description 'Prospector' is a medium-size elm with a light- grey bark, attaining a height of approximately 14 m and developing a vase shape broadly similar to the American Elm but with lower-drooping branches . The deep-green, glossy obovate leaves are < 11 cm long by 8 cm wide, emerging orange-red and turning yellow in autumn. The perfect, apetalous wind- pollinated flowers emerge in early spring, before the leaves. The samara, <15 mm long, is obovate to orbicular; specimens grown in Hampshire, England, first flowered and fruited aged 10 years.Brookes, A. H. (2020). Great Fontley Elm Trial, 2020 Report.

In Arizona, the tree proved unsuited to the hot, arid climate and suffered > 50% leaf scorch. In trials conducted by the University of Minnesota, 'Prospector' was appreciated for its extraordinary vigour but faulted for the weakness of its wood, notably stem breakage owing to bark inclusion.Giblin, C.

Nonetheless, it is considered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) as suitable for Zones 4-7\\\\. The tree is currently being evaluated in the National Elm Trial coordinated by Colorado State University. 'Prospector' was introduced to Europe by Butterfly Conservation in 2009 as part of its elm trials programme in Hampshire but has exhibited very slow growth, its stem increasing by just 2 mm in diameter at breast height per annum.

After the outbreak of World War I, the three-quarter returned to Australia, where he rejoined South Sydney. In 1916, Gilbert joined Eastern Suburbs. He was a member of that club's City Cup winning side before joining the Western Suburbs Magpies in 1917. He played with them until 1920, helping to transfer them from a struggling side to a competitive outfit. Gilbert returned to the Australian Test team as captain in the 2nd Test of the Lions' 1920 tour of Australia. All four of Australia's illustrious three-quarter line of Dick Vest, Harold Horder, Viv Farnsworth and Gilbert scored tries in Australia's 21‚Äì8 victory.

It proved to be a forlorn hope, because the national strategic importance of Cheshire and of the city port of Chester meant that national interests overruled local ones. History At the start of the First English Civil War, after a summer of skirmishes in Cheshire, Henry Mainwaring and Mr. Marbury of Marbury Hall for Parliament and Lord Kilmorey and Sir Orlando Bridgeman, son of the Bishop of Chester, for the Royalists agreed to meet on December 23 at Bunbury. They agreed that all fighting in Cheshire would end. All prisoners would be released, property taken during the conflict returned to its owners and any losses compensated by a levy on both sides. Fortifications were to be removed at Chester, Nantwich, Stockport, Knutsford and Northwich and their combined forces would escort any external forces out of the county. Both parties agreed that there were to be no further troop movements through Cheshire, and that they would not to raise any more troops locally. Everything depending on the agreement of their national commanders, whom they would urge to settle their differences peacefully. Given the national strategic importance of Cheshire, it proved impossible for the local gentry to agree a local neutrality pact that their national commanders would agree to. Geographically Cheshire lies between the Pennines and the north Welsh foothills and so whoever controlled Cheshire controlled the western route to north west England and Scotland as well as an important route into north Wales. For Parliament the control of Cheshire would mean separating the King's northern supporters from the King and his army at Oxford. It could also stop the King bringing in reinforcements from his Irish army through the port of Chester. During the summer the King's supporters had not been idle and Chester's defences had been strengthened with the Commissioners of Array arranging to man the defences. In addition the city's corporation raised an additional 300 men to assist them, that were paid for by a monthly assessment (local tax) on all inhabitants. These preparations continued in December when the corporation raised more money through another assessment for additional weapons and fortifications.Lecture given to the worldwide Brereton Family ReunionEarly modern Chester 1550-1762: The civil war and interregnum, 1642-60', A History of the County of Chester: Volume 5 (i): The City of Chester: General History and Topography (2003), Page 115 Sir William Brereton and Dunham Massey, the leading Parliamentarians in Cheshire were in London and did not agree with the Agreement. On 9 January 1643 (New Style) Brereton was commissioned by Parliament to take control of the Parliamentary forces in Cheshire and Massey was ordered to take command of the Cheshire Militia. These actions effectively killed the Agreement. On 19 January, the King announced that he was sending Sir Thomas Aston as a Major-General to Cheshire and Lancashire. Aston's orders were simply stated by Prince Rupert; he was to take his regiment to Shropshire, raise forces of horse and foot there, and then defend Cheshire against the Parliamentary force that was heading to the county from London under the leadership of Sir William Brereton. He was also to seize arms and ammunition for the King's use and \\"put into execution the laws and customs martial upon all offenders.....for the better preventing of disorders, plunderings and outrages which are often committed by soldiers.\\" He was told to achieve this and return to the main army by 15 March unless he received orders to the contrary. The Cheshire Commissioners of Array were also given explicit orders as to what they should do to help Aston. The King explained to them that as the Parliamentarians had rejected the Bunbury Agreement and were sending a force to Cheshire, he was sending Aston and his regiment of horse to protect the county. After some skirmishes and maneuvering for position, these two opposing forces would fight a pitched battle, the First Battle of Middlewich, on 13 March 1643.The dates in this article are adjusted to show the year starting on 1 January but retaining the Julian calendar (See Old Style and New Style dates).

Creditrans was a travel card used to travel around Biscay, in the Basque Country (Spain). The card was the most popular ticket in the area, used by over 100 million passengers in 2007. History When the Metro Bilbao system was created in 1995 the local authorities realized that the transport system integration around Bilbao was very deficient. There were four rail companies (five now with the creation of the tramway) and two bus companies, each one with different zones and fare systems, plus different ticket machines and even ticket sizes. The Biscay Transport Consortium (CTB), created in 1975 to build the underground, was the public company that would lead the efforts to overcome the situation. After some efforts to adapt the machines and information systems, the bus and underground were integrated, the basque railways soon followed and finally FEVE entered the system in 2006. The last remaining company to join the system was RENFE, which operates three rail lines in the area, the company was incorporated to the Creditrans system during 2009. In 2012 the Creditrans tickets were replaced by plastic Barik card which work on the same principle except you can add credit to them through the regular ticket machines instead of buying a new card each time.

Life and career Edathy was born in Hanover, Lower Saxony, the son of an immigrant from Kerala, India and a German mother. He has studied sociology and published books on immigration and right-wing extremism. He was an SPD member of the Bundestag from 1998, representing Nienburg II ‚Äì Schaumburg. He was a member of former Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der's red-green coalition, and a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition. He was the chairman of the Bundestag Committee on Interior Affairs and was chairman of the German- Indian group of members of the Bundestag. He was re-elected in the general election in September 2009 and again in the general election in September 2013. Resignation Edathy announced his resignation from parliament \\"for health reasons\\" on 7 February 2014. Just two days after his resignation went public, his home and offices were searched by authorities; media outlets asserted that the searches were made on allegations of possession of child pornography. 14 February 2014, Hans-Peter Friedrich, resigned from the ruling CDU‚ÄìSPD grand coalition government reacting to imminent legal investigations into incidents during his tenure as Federal Minister of the Interior. Friedrich was accused of betraying state secrets about legal investigations to SPD party heads during the coalition negotiations after the federal elections in 2013 about information showing Edathy's link to a globally-operating child pornography syndicate and plans to take up an investigation against Edathy on suspicion of possessing such material. \\"The SPD's top leaders, who received the intelligence information from Friedrich, said they have not given any tip- off to Edathy and they kept the information secret.\\" They are Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who is also Merkel's deputy; Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier; and the party's parliamentary leader, Thomas Oppermann. Edathy admitted to having purchased some material by a Canadian firm, but he denied the allegations of possessing child pornographic content, he insisted the material he purchased was \\"unambiguously legal.\\" The criminal investigation into child pornography turned into a crisis for Germany's new grand coalition government and the Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt, BKA) came under growing pressure for its role in the scandal after reports revealed serious failures in the investigation of child porn claims against Edathy. The BKA received documents from Canadian authorities in October 2011 that involved possible child porn claims about Edathy, but it only conveyed documents to the state authorities in Lower Saxony two years after, in late 2013 for further investigation. Politicians from the socialist The Left, Green and the classical liberal Free Democrat parties all voiced disbelief that the BKA did not know. Die Linke chief Bernd Riexinger: \\"It is absolutely not plausible that information about Edathy did not reach the BKA.\\" FDP vice chairman Wolfgang Kubicki told that in the ranks of the BKA \\"either idiots were at work or they were trying to avoid a scandal.\\" Even the Christian Social Union ‚Äì the Bavarian sister party of Chancellor Merkel's dominant CDU ‚Äì expressed confusion, interior spokesman Stephan Mayer: \\"It is inexplicable that the BKA did not notice that Edathy's name was on the list of child porn buyers.\\" In March 2015 Edathy admitted to having downloaded, with his official laptop, videos and pictures of naked minors from the Internet. He has acknowledged he made a mistake. Following Edathy's admission, the Verden District Court in the German state of Lower Saxony handed the former Social Democrats (SPD) deputy a fine of 5,000 euros ($5,600), bringing the trial to an end.

Trained in ecology, philosophy, and environmental planning, his work concerns ecological restoration, historical ecology, intervention ecology, and the changing character of life in technological society.  Early Life and Training Eric Higgs was born in Brantford, Ontario, to David P.J. Higgs and Barbara Isabel Stowe. His pre-school years were in North Delta, British Columbia (near Vancouver). He attended public school in Thornhill, Ontario (near Toronto), and secondary school (Brantford Collegiate and Pauline Johnston Secondary School) in Brantford. In 1976 he turned away from what had been a strong early passion for physics and engineering, and attend the Integrated Studies Program at the University of Waterloo. The Integrated Studies Program was student- driven and required self-motivation to complete an open curriculum in a subjects of the student's choosing. He completed an undergraduate thesis, \\"A theory for the interaction of ecology and the social order,\\" that blended history of ecology with social philosophy and environmental ethics. Immediately upon graduation with a Bachelor of Independent Studies (B.I.S.) in 1979, he took up an internship at the Hastings Centre (Institute for the Study of Ethics, Society and the Life Sciences) in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, where he undertook a project on environmental and ecological ethics. He completed a master's degree in philosophy of science at the University of Western Ontario (1980‚Äì81), and at the same time undertook ecological consulting work in Southern Ontario. He returned to the University of Waterloo to a new interdisciplinary doctoral program, in which he combined studies in the Department of Philosophy and the School of Urban and Regional Planning. Working with co-supervisors, Lawrence Haworth, a social and moral philosopher, and Robert Dorney, an ecologist and environmental planner, Higgs completed his dissertation, \\"Planning, Technology and Community Autonomy,\\" in 1988.  Career  He is a Professor at the University of Victoria in the School of Environmental Studies. His first appointment was in the Department of Environment and Resource Studies at the University Waterloo (1987‚Äì88). He moved to New York City in 1988 to continue research in philosophy of technology in the Philosophy and Technology Studies Center at the Polytechnic University of New York. Higgs' taught at Oberlin College as a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Environmental Studies Program in 1989-90, before taking a tenure-stream position in the new Science, Technology and Society Program at the University of Alberta. The demise of this program led to a formal appointment initially in the Department of Philosophy (1990‚Äì92), and later a joint appointment in the Departments of Anthropology and Sociology. He was awarded tenure and promoted to Associate Professor in 1995. In 2002, he became Director (2002-2010) and Associate Professor in the School of Environmental Studies at the University of Victoria, and promoted to Full Professor in 2005. Higgs has held shorter appointments in Science, Technology and Society (1995), the Maurice Young Centre for Applied Ethics at the University of British Columbia (1996), the School of Environmental Studies at the University of Victoria (2000). He is Professor-at-Large in the Institute for Advanced Studies at the University of Western Australia (2012-2014). Professional Activities Eric Higgs was Chair of the Society for Ecological Restoration International (now Society for Ecological Restoration ser.org). He served previously as Secretary to the Board from 1995-2001.  Writings  In 2000 he co-edited (with Andrew Light and David Strong) a volume of essays discussing the work of Albert Borgmann which was described by Paul Durbin as one of the first volumes that explicitly strives to establish the philosophy of technology as an academic subdiscipline with canonical texts .

K. Thamboosamy Pillay (Tamil: ‡Æ§‡ÆÆ‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÅ‡Æö‡Ææ‡ÆÆ‡Æø ‡Æ™‡Æø‡Æ≥‡Øç‡Æ≥‡Øà) was a prominent Malaysian of Tamil origin during the pre-independence years. He was considered the leader of the Tamil community. He was a wealthy businessman, tin miner, moneylender and government contractor. Thamboosamy was one of the founders and one of the original Trustees of Victoria Institution as well as the founder of the Sri Mahamariamman Temple, Kuala Lumpur. Background Born in Singapore in 1850, K. Thamboosamy Pillay received his early education at Raffles Institution. He sailed to Klang in 1875 with James Guthrie Davidson, when the latter was appointed Malaya's first British Resident. Prior to that, he had been a clerk in the legal firm in which Davidson was a partner. He was later transferred to the Treasury where he eventually became chief clerk and acted as State Treasurer on a few occasions. He was sent to India by the Malayan Government to bring over the first batch of Indian immigrants for the Railway and Public Works. Thamboosamy resigned from Government service in the 1880s and, going into partnership with towkay Loke Yew, managed the New Tin Mining Company in Rawang. They were the first to use electric pumps for mining in Malaya. A Justice of Peace and member of the prestigious KL Sanitary Board, Thamboosamy was the acknowledged leader of the Tamil community. His other business interests included coffee planting, real estate and construction. He constructed part of the main road from Kuala Lumpur to Kuala Kubu. He was a member of both the Selangor Club and the Turf Club and owned several horses. Thamboosamy died in 1902 in Singapore, where he had gone to attend a meeting at the Singapore Turf Club. Contributions A Justice of Peace and member of the prestigious KL Sanitary Board, Thamboosamy was the acknowledged leader of the Indian community in Malaya, especially in Kuala Lumpur. Thamboosamy was one of the founders and one of the original Trustees of Victoria Institution. One of the sports houses in VI is named after him. His son, K. T. Ganapathy Pillay, was a Victorian and served as the second President of the VIOBA. Religion The Sri Mahamariamman Temple, Kuala Lumpur was founded by Thamboosamy in 1873 and was initially used as a private shrine by the Pillai family. The family threw open the temple doors to the public in the late 1920s and eventually handed the management of the temple over to a board of trustees. This is the oldest functioning Hindu temple in Malaysia. It is also reputed to be the richest in the country. The Temple was originally sited somewhere near the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station. It shifted to its present location along Jalan Tun H.S. Lee (next to KL's Chinatown) in 1885. He was also said to have discovered Batu Caves, with its vel-shaped entrance, and was inspired to start a Hindu temple in devotion to Lord Muruga. So great was Thamboosamy's philanthropic spirit, that he donated money to whoever needed it, regardless of race or religion. He contributed a sizeable amount of money to the building fund of St. Mary's Cathedral, Kuala Lumpur in 1893, despite being a Hindu. Awards and recognition A street in the Chow Kit district and a Tamil primary school in Sentul are also named in his memory.

However, due to the country's unique geography, Greece has a remarkable range of micro-climates and local variations. The Greek mainland is extremely mountainous, making Greece one of the most mountainous countries in Europe. To the west of the Pindus mountain range, the climate is generally wetter and has some maritime features. The east of the Pindus mountain range is generally drier and windier in summer. The highest peak is Mount Olympus, . The north areas of Greece have a transitional climate between the continental and the Mediterranean climate. There are mountainous areas that have an alpine climate. Categories The climate of Greece can be divided into the following Mediterranean climate subtypes:  Mediterranean (dry and wet)  According to the Climate Atlas of Greece which was published by the Hellenic National Meteorological Service (H.N.M.S) this is the predominant climate found in Greece. This climate occurs in the Aegean Islands, especially the Cyclades and the Dodecanese, southern and Evia, low- lying areas of Attica, the western, eastern and southern low-lying Peloponnese areas, and the low-lying areas of Crete. During the summer, the weather is most frequently sunny and dry, and any precipitation falls in the form of showers or thunderstorms from cumuliform clouds. The air is usually hot during the day and pleasantly warm at night, but there are some very windy days, especially in the Cyclades islands and around them. Heatwaves may occur, but they are usually quite mild at the coastal areas, where temperatures are moderated by the relatively cooler sea and the sea breeze. Winters are wet and any snow that falls does not last long, especially in the south-facing slopes. Rain in winter is often persistent: The west areas of this climate zone receive a relatively higher amount of precipitation. Alpine Mediterranean In this climate, the winter is harsh with an abundance snowfalls, while the summers are cool with frequent thunderstorms. This climate is to be found on high mountains, like Pindus and Rhodope. Transitional continental- Mediterranean This climate has characteristics of both continental and Mediterranean climate. Semi-arid climate (hot and cold) According to the Climate Atlas of Greece published by the Hellenic National Meteorological Service (H.N.M.S) this climate is found in areas of Macedonia and Thessaly (cold semi-arid) and also in areas of Attica such as Piraeus in the Athens Riviera (hot semi-arid).  Temperature  *Abs. minimum temperature: , Ptolemaida. *Abs. maximum temperature: , Elefsina and Tatoi. The recorded by minimum/maximum thermometers in Tatoi and Elefsina as reported by a communication of Dr. Athanasios D. Sarantopoulos is also the WMO record high temperature for Greece and Europe.. Arizona State University World Meteorological Organization Mean annual temperatures in Greece range from in Lindos. However, since Greece is generally a mountainous country, real average temperatures vary considerably from region to region. Local winds Etesians Probably the most well known local winds in Greece are the etesians (also known as meltemia). With their name notating their annual fluctuation (Œ≠œÑŒøœÇ (√©tos) means year in Greek), these winds may blow from May to October, with their highest frequency being recorded in July and August. They keep temperatures and diurnal temperature fluctuations in the Aegean sea lower than the respective ones found in the Ionian sea or mainland Greece.

Born and raised in England, Robinson was always interested in the welfare of animals. As a child she volunteered in veterinary offices during her school holidays. In the mid-1980s she moved to Hong Kong, where she began working for the International Fund for Animal Welfare, focusing on work in China and South Korea. In 1993, Robinson visited a bear bile farm in China. According to Robinson, at the time approximately 10,000 Asiatic black bears were caged at farms similar to this one, in conditions many animal welfare groups consider horrific. At bear bile farms, bile is extracted from the bear's gallbladder for use in traditional Chinese medicines. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, only about 15,000-20,000 Asiatic black bears are alive in the wild in China, which would qualify them for the highest protection described by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Chinese authorities estimate that over 50,000 of the bears live in the wild, which would eliminate the necessity for higher protection. Professor Peter Li believes that Robinson \\"single-handedly alerted the world\\" to the cruel practice of bear farming. For the next seven years, Robinson researched the way bile was used and negotiated with the Chinese government. In 2000, the Sichuan Forestry Department signed a pledge with the China Wildlife Conservation Association to release 500 bears from the bile farms with the worst conditions. This marked the first time an agency of the Chinese government had come to an official agreement with an animal welfare organization. To house the released bears, Robinson founded Animals Asia Foundation and established a bear rescue center in Chengdu. The foundation has since established a similar sanctuary in Vietnam, where there are also hundreds of bear bile farms. In April 2014, representing Animals Asia, Robinson announced plans to convert a bear bile farm with over 130 Asiatic black bears in Nanning, China into an animal sanctuary. The farm was part of Flower World, a state-owned horticulture and landscaping company. In 2017, Robinson announced an MOU alongside the Deputy General Director of the Vietnam Administration of Forestry, Cao Chi Cong, to end bear bile farming in Vietnam by 2020 and to work together to rescue the remaining 1,000 bears still in cages.

It was released on March 28, 2007. The album is the first to feature vocalist Mathias Lillm√•ns, who replaced Tapio Wilska in 2006. Unlike in Nattf√∂dd, the lyrics for this album were written by the band's original vocalist, Jan \\"Katla\\" J√§msen. This and other factors appear to contribute to a darker, more black metal feel. A music video for \\"Nedg√•ng\\" was released in April.  Concept  The band approached the founding member J√§msen about writing the lyrics for this album. He chose to continue a semi-mythical saga which has been touched upon throughout Finntroll's career. The \\"kingshaman of the trolls\\" character Rivfader (Ripfather), was first introduced in their first demo, fittingly titled \\"Rivfader\\" (re-recorded for Midnattens widunder), but J√§msen has said that the story truly originated in the song \\"F√∂dosagan\\" on the second album, Jaktens tid. The song \\"Eliytres\\", from Nattf√∂dd, also makes reference to Rivfader. Aside from this, the lyrical concept for this album was based on Nordic myths, the Kalevala (the Finnish national epic), history and stories of J√§msen's own creation. He has stated that the focus has moved from conflict between pagan and Christian beliefs, to being more concerned with the nature of myth, symbolism, and the origin of all mythology. This is meant to complement the old-and-new dynamic of the musical aspect of Finntroll, which mixes traditional folk music with very modern metal music. The narrative of the album itself concerns a struggle between witches and troll-shamans, the death and resurrection of Rivfader, the \\"journey and odyssey of the shaman\\" and the \\"great war against one-self\\".

The film was released by Columbia Pictures and has music by Franz Liszt, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Richard Wagner, arranged by Muir Mathieson. The cinematography was by Georges P√©rinal and the costume design by Givenchy. Plot Egomaniacal and temperamental Victor Fabian is the London Festival Orchestra's conductor. His wife, Dolly, is a harpist who acts on her husband's behalf, presenting his impossible demands to the symphony's backers, only to then find him dallying with a considerably younger musician. Dolly decides to leave him, whereupon he destroys her harp. Victor's conducting suffers in Dolly's absence and the orchestra needs her back. His agent, Max Archer, tries to get him a new contract, but young Wilbur, son of the orchestra's patron saint, insists to Victor's horror that any agreement must include a performance of his mother's favorite piece of music, John Philip Sousa's Stars and Stripes Forever. Rather than return, Dolly wants a divorce so she can marry Dr. Richard Hilliard, a physicist. An angry Victor blurts out that to be divorced, two people must first be married. It turns out colleagues only assumed Victor and Dolly were husband and wife, and they had never actually tied the knot. Victor won't grant a quick marriage and equally quick divorce unless she agrees to live with him for three more weeks. He wears down her resolve, and Hilliard catches her in a frilly nightgown. A frustrated Dolly tells both she just wants to live alone. She applauds from the audience as Victor, with great reluctance, launches the orchestra into a rousing Stars and Stripes Forever. Background The play Once More, With Feeling, which was adapted for this film, opened on Broadway on 21 October 1958 at the National Theatre, in a production directed by George Axelrod and designed by George Jenkins, and starring Joseph Cotten, Arlene Francis, and Walter Matthau, who was nominated for a Tony Award as Best featured actor. The play ran for 263 performances. The film was Kay Kendall's last. She died of leukemia on 6 September 1959 before the film's release. Cast * Yul Brynner as Victor Fabian * Kay Kendall as Dolly Fabian * Gregory Ratoff as Maxwell Archer * Geoffrey Toone as Dr. Richard Hilliard * Maxwell Shaw as Jascha Gendel / Grisha Gendel * Mervyn Johns as Mr. Wilbur Jr. * Martin Benson as Luigi Bardini * Harry Lockart as Chester * Shirley Anne Field as Angela Hopper Novelization In January, 1960, Pyramid Books issued a paperback novelization \\"based on the stage and screen plays\\"; the author was celebrated American potboiler novelist and showbiz biographer Ann Pinchot (1905‚Äì1998). The cover price was 35¬¢. It was concurrently published in the UK, also as a paperback, by WDL; the cover price was 2'6. The nearly identical front panel designs feature a painting by prolific paperback cover artist Tom Miller, intimately depicting Kay Kendall, reclining on a couch with a martini, and Yul Brynner, behind the couch, leaning in.

A dispute between cane farmers and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company (CSR) in 1960 regarding a new cane contract led to the formation of the Federation of Cane Growers under the leadership of Dr A. D. Patel in May 1959. The Federation soon split, however: on 24 July 1960, Ayodhya Prasad of Kisan Sangh and Vijay R. Singh of Labasa Kisan Sangh broke away and signed an agreement with CSR for the purchase of the 1960 crop. They were joined by B. D. Lakshman. Singh and Lakshman accused Patel of dividing the Indian population and leading them further into debt. Intercommunal tensions also rose, with some Fijians, such as the Lauan Chief and Legislative Council member Ratu Kamisese Mara, called for Patel to be deported. The Government appointed a commission of inquiry, headed by Sir Malcolm Trustram Eve, into the sugar industry. The Federation Committee was represented by A.D. Patel, assisted by Sidiq Koya. The findings of the commission were largely unfavourable to Patel's demands. The Federation of Cane Growers contested the 1963 Legislative Council election under the banner of Citizens Federation. It was not organized as a formal political party but sought to promote economic, cultural and political progress and stability in a united Fiji. All three Citizen‚Äôs Federation candidates were elected to the Legislative Council. In the Western Constituency, A.D. Patel defeated Deo Sharma, president of the Kisan Sangh by 6244 votes to 3346, in the North Viti Levu Constituency, Sidiq Koya defeated James Shankar Singh by 3,998 votes to 3,480, and in the Northern Constituency James Madhavan defeated Harish Chandra Kohli by 2,753 votes to 2,175. There was no Citizens Federation candidate in the Southern Constituency, won by Andrew Deoki. The success of the Citizens Federation in the 1963 elections, and the impending constitutional convention, prompted Patel to transform the Citizens Federation into a fully fledged political party. The Federation Party was duly founded on 21 June 1964, with A.D. Patel as President and Sidiq Koya as Vice-president.

Derived from a crossing of the American hybrid 'Urban' (female parent) with the Wilson's Elm (now treated as Japanese Elm U. davidiana var. japonica) cultivar 'Prospector', 'Patriot' was released to commerce, free of patent restrictions, in 1993. Description The tree develops an upsweeping crown, ultimately adopting a narrow vase-shape. The leaves are slightly obovate, with doubly serrate margins and typically acuminate apices; they are of an average size for the genus, < 10 cm long by 7.5 cm broad, glossy dark green turning yellow in autumn.Santamour, J., Frank, S. & Bentz, S.

The perfect, apetalous wind-pollinated flowers appear in March. Flowering usually begins when the tree is aged six years. Growth is vigorous; specimens in the USDA trials reaching a height of over 13 m (43 ft) and a spread of nearly 8 m (25 ft) after only 13 years. In an assessment at U C Davis as part of the National Elm Trial, 'Patriot' increased in height by almost 1.5 m and d.b.h. by 2.5 cm per annum.McPherson, G. et al. (2008).

Tolerance of the elm leaf beetle Xanthogaleruca luteola is generally regarded as only moderate, although specimens grown at the aforementioned trials at U C Davis were among those cultivars least affected; resistance to Japanese Beetle is poor.Brady, C., Condra, J., & Potter, D.

Propagation from softwood cuttings is reputedly easy; taken in mid-May, treated with a 3000 ppm IBA rooting hormone and placed under mist, < 95% should root in less than four weeks. However, commercial propagation is commonly by grafting onto a Siberian Elm Ulmus pumila rootstock. As height increase can rapidly outstrip stem width, lopping the stem above a leaf node at breast height and vertically training the new leader is recommended to create a more stable structure.

The nearest larger settlements are Great Torrington ( west), South Molton ( east), and Barnstaple ( north).Ordnance Survey Landranger maps The village is on a slight ridge (presumably hence the name), at around 160 m (520 ft). It is on the B3217 road. It has unbroken views across the valley towards Exmoor.Official Website of High Bickington CPT Limited - High Bickington, Umberleigh, North Devon The civil parish of High Bickington is spread over a wider area. The full name also distinguishes it from two other Devon villages: Bickington (in Teignbridge District) and Abbot's Bickington. History With its origins in Saxon times (around 650), or earlier, the manor of High Bickington is referred to as 'Bichentone' in the Domesday Book of 1086. Before the Norman Conquest, the manor belonged to a Saxon nobleman, Britric, nicknamed Meau ('the fair'), who also held rights to the land revenues of Gloucester and extensive estates in the West Country. He spurned the advances of Matilda, the Duke of Flanders' daughter and later the wife of William the Conqueror. She later imprisoned Britric and eventually had him put to death. All his lands passed to her, including Bichentona, Clovelly, Bideford, Winkleigh and Tiverton. The lands were later inherited by Matilda's son, William Rufus, who became William II of England. William gave Bichentona to Robert Fitzhamon whose daughter was later married to Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester, illegitimate son of Henry I. In around 1150 the manor of High Bickington came into the possession of the Champernownes of Umberleigh. Lady Joan Champernowne gave some of the lands to the Lodges family. Hugh de Loges held the manor of Buckington Loges during the reigns of King John and Henry III (1199-1261). This was inherited by William Boyes in 1364, although by this time the lands around the village had been divided between several others including Holt, Clavil, Snape, Stowford, Corpsland, Burvet and Wotton, whose names still survive today in hamlet, farm and field names around the parish. From about 1400 onwards, owners were selling off parcels of land. The Church manor of Corpsiland, south of the present village high street, and including the property still known as Parsonage, was held by the parson until 1800. The Bassetts of Umberleigh inherited lands from the Champernownes, while the Pyncombes of North Molton acquired large areas around the parish from around 1500 onwards. The last of them, Mrs Gertrude Pyncombe, in her will of 20 January 1730, founded a charitable educational trust from which grants are still made to local children. The population of the parish/village was given as 17 families, around a hundred people, at the time of the Domesday Book; this rose to a peak of 851 people in 1851. By 1901 it had fallen to 539, and it continued to fall to around 410 in the 1950s. Since then the population has steadily risen as a result of recent development, and now stands near its 1801 level. Industry and facilities Agriculture has always been and still is the main industry in the parish. In the past, the village was almost self- sufficient, but in modern times with the advent of the motor car most business now takes place away from the village, in towns such as Barnstaple, Bideford, Torrington and South Molton. The village still has a post office, shop, doctor's surgery, school, golf course and two pubs. The village has mobile services for fruit and vegetables and fresh fish, and a council library service. Building trades services can be found in and around the village. The village has a football team, cricket team and various pub-sport teams. High Bickington is still largely unspoilt and retains much of the character of an isolated rural country village, including many thatched cottages, cobbled pavements and narrow streets.Welcome to High Bickington There is an historic English manor house 3 miles south-west of the village: Northcote Manor, now a hotel. The nearest stations are Umberleigh and Portsmouth Arms, both about 2.5 miles away by road, and both on the Tarka Line. Sports Clubs The village has a cricket and football team, the latter of which (High Bickington FC) compete in the North Devon Football league, currently the Intermediate 1 division.The home of High Bickington FC The village is now home to a Badminton club as well.

He holds the Canada Research Chair in the Philosophy of Technology in the School of Communication at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver. His main interests are philosophy of technology, continental philosophy, critique of technology and science and technology studies. Education Feenberg studied philosophy under Herbert Marcuse at the University of California, San Diego and was awarded his PhD in 1972. During this time Feenberg was active in the New Left, founding a journal entitled Alternatives and participating in the May '68 events in Paris. Feenberg's philosophy of technology Feenberg's primary contribution to the philosophy of technology is his argument for the democratic transformation of technology. From his book Transforming Technology, :\\"What human beings are and will become is decided in the shape of our tools no less than in the action of statesmen and political movements. The design of technology is thus an ontological decision fraught with political consequences. The exclusion of the vast majority from participation in this decision is profoundly undemocratic\\" (p.3). Feenberg provides the theoretical foundation for this idea through the Critical Theory of Technology which he develops over three books: The Critical Theory of Technology (1991) (re-published as Transforming Technology: A Critical Theory Revisited [2002]), Alternative Modernity: The Technical Turn in Philosophy and Social Theory (1995), and Questioning Technology (1999). The basis of Feenberg's critical theory of technology is a concept of dialectical technological rationality he terms instrumentalization theory. Instrumentalization theory combines the social critique of technology familiar from the philosophy of technology (Karl Marx, Herbert Marcuse, Martin Heidegger, Jacques Ellul) with insights taken from the empirical case studies of science and technology studies. Applications of his theory include studies of online education, the Minitel, the Internet, and digital games. Feenberg has also published books and articles on the philosophy of Herbert Marcuse, Martin Heidegger, J√ºrgen Habermas, Karl Marx, Georg Lukacs, and Kitar≈ç Nishida.

The manga was serialized in the Square Enix's Monthly Stencil magazine, and later serialized in Monthly Gangan Wing. The English language translation of the manga is published by Broccoli Books. Plot In post-apocalyptic Japan, a devastating earthquake called the \\"Great Sinker\\" sank 1/3 of the southern islands and cities were destroyed. Monsters known as Atanan appear, creating chaos and fear among the survivors. Youths with supernatural powers fight against the Atanan and control the government-less ruins. Fearing that the imbalance of the spirits known as the kamui will destroy the Earth, a teenager named Atsuma is sent from his village to retrieve Okikurumi, the sacred kamui, to restore the balance and peace. He joins NOA, the organization of youths with supernatural powers, to find Okikurumi and to stop the world destruction. Characters ;: Having no tohsu, or power to communicate with the kamui, he is shunned by his village. He is forced to make a contract with Kojomaru, the spirit of an ancient sword, and sent to EDEN (neo-Tokyo) to retrieve the Okikurumi. Betrayed by someone he once admired, he trusts no one and keeps distanced from others. After spending time at NOA, he begins to trust again, living for the people he cares for. Those people being Shui, Sumire, Anzu, and, once upon a time, Utsuho. ;: Second in command at NOA, Commander of the Sky Division. She is infused with the power of the wind.

Despite his age, Kojomaru is very short tempered and immature. He thinks his sole purpose in the series is to protect the Okikurumi.

Plot Tim, Graeme and Bill are having a hard time living inside while the entire country is polluted. When they travel to Eastbourne,they notice how widespread the pollution is. They discover that the Ministry for Pollution is responsible for the problem by destroying environment in England's grass-fields, farm-fields, forests and beaches and set up an embezzlement to farmers as a pose for putting things right. The Goodies learn about the Minister Of Pollution's scheme for making money for the national economy and the British government, including the Prime Minister, are under the influence of the Pollution making Ministry. The trio force take the matter into their hands by arranging an anti-polluting mixture of Graeme's development for clearing the atmosphere and creating widespread grass to overcome the pollution, by seeding the clouds with grass seeds and fertiliser, and the results are far beyond their wildest dreams. Cars can no longer be driven, because the streets cannot be seen, and everybody grows grass instead of hair. Lawn mowers are in fashion as transport -- also in fashion are tiny garden ornaments and scarecrows which are made especially for wearing in people's hair. Birds also profit by being able to build nests in the hair. Although all seems to be idyllic, the Goodies find that there is an unexpected drawback to their environmental solution to the problem.

Biography John was born in the Canton area of Cardiff, to Thomas Johm, a wood carver from Llantrithyd and Elizabeth, nee Smith, from Randwick in Gloucestershire.Introduction to \\"Sir William Goscombe John, R.A., LL.D. Sculpture in the National Museum of Wales Catalogue\\" dated 1948 As a youth John assisted his father in the restoration of Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch during 1874 which was being overseen by William Burges. He initially studied in his home town, attending the Cardiff School of Art throughout the 1870s and also took anatomy classes. John went to London in 1881 and worked as a pupil- assistant in the studio of Thomas Nicholls, Burges's architectural carver. John then studied at the South London School of Technical Art under Jules Dalou and William Silver Frith and afterward at the Royal Academy schools, where he won the gold medal and a travelling scholarship in 1887. Throughout 1890 and 1891 he travelled in Europe and Africa and, in 1891, studied in Paris with Auguste Rodin. Also in 1891, he married the Swiss-born Marthe Weiss. Their daughter Muriel married Frederick Luke Val Fildes, the son of the artist Sir Luke Fildes. As a young man he adopted the first name Goscombe, taken from the name of a village in Gloucestershire near his mother's home. Goscombe John returned to Paris in 1892 to show a statuette, Morpheus at the Paris Salon. John embraced the vigous naturalistic style of the New Sculpture movement and cemented his reputation with works such as John the Baptist for Lord Bute and with a number of life-sized figures including The Elf and Boy at Play. By the early 1890s John had established himself as a sculptor of some note and began to receive significant public commissions. Although based in London, John won a number of large commissions in his native Wales. These included his 1916 marble St David Blessing the People and ten other figures for Cardiff City Hall. He designed the Hirlas Horn for the 1898 National Eisteddfod of Wales and a set of ceremonial tools to mark the building of the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff. His statue of the shipping magnate and philanthropist John Cory was erected in front of Cardiff City Hall. He received a further number of national and international commissions, including for several war memorials. In 1921 he designed the memorial at Port Sunlight to the employees of Lever Brothers Ltd who had died in the First World War; he also sculpted portraits of Lord and Lady Lever. John received gold medals from the Paris Salon in 1892 and 1901, was made a Royal Academician in 1909, was knighted in 1911, and became corresponding member of the Institut de France. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in London in 1886 and continued to do so annually until 1948. John settled in Greville Road, Kilburn, London (in a house that had previously belonged to Seymour Lucas), and is buried in Hampstead Cemetery. The memorial statue of his wife, which he designed when she died in 1923, was stolen from the cemetery in 2001 but recovered after a few months; it was put into secure storage, but was again stolen in early 2007.

For its first four series, it was presented by Lolita Chakrabarti. El Nombre, an animated character used throughout the series, eventually became the concept for his own educational BBC children's television program; his name means \\"The Name\\" in Spanish, and not \\"The Number\\", which would be \\"El N√∫mero\\". The third line of his opening song and his farewell catchphrase were also changed several times during the series' run, to reflect their focus - however, the original ones (\\"Writing numbers in the desert sand\\" which was also used for the seventh series, and \\"Adios amigos, and keep counting\\" which was also used for the fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth series) remain the most famous. For the second series, El Nombre's tagline and farewell catchphrase were changed to \\"Drawing shapes in the desert sand\\" and \\"Adios amigos, and keep shaping up\\" respectively, while for the third series, they were changed to \\"Righting wrongs in the desert sand\\" and \\"Adios amigos, over and out\\" respectively; however, for the fourth series, his tagline was changed to \\"Counting numbers in the desert sand\\" (which was also used for the ninth series), and for the third episode of the fourth series, his farewell catchphrase was changed to \\"Adios amigos, and fetch some water\\". For the fifth series, both his tagline and farewell catchphrase were changed to \\"Telling time in the desert sand\\" and \\"Adios amigos, 'till the next time\\" respectively, while for the sixth series, his tagline was changed to \\"Using numbers in the desert sand\\"; finally, for the eighth series, his tagline was changed to \\"Counting money in the desert sand\\". Series 1: Numbers 1 to 10 (Autumn 1993) The first series, which is aimed at four- to five-year-olds, comprised ten episodes focusing on the numbers 1-10, in order; each episode opened with Lolita introducing herself to the viewer, and pulling the number for the episode off its string (which was hanging from the studio ceiling), then pushing it into its correct hole in a wall, and singing the main theme, One to Ten, as each of its holes lit up in turn, which was repeated throughout the programme. In between, there were comedy sketches (mostly based on nursery rhymes and fairy tales), and animations, the most famous involving El Nombre, the Mexican gerbil who parodied Zorro, showing little Juan how to draw numbers as his four-piece mariachi band played The Mexican Hat Dance (and said \\"Again!\\" once he had finished, as it gave them an excuse to play again), and a sequence encouraging the viewer to spot things of the number for each episode - it was the same video, with a different number of things each time (and a recurring song, Numbers All Around, which was sung by a group of children). Each episode ended with Lolita singing a song (or occasionally, introducing an animation), after which she would set viewers the challenge of looking for things in the number of the week's episode before saying that she would \\"see them next Numbertime\\". This series was originally aired on Mondays as part of the Daytime on Two strand at 9:45am, and repeated at 2:00pm on the same day; in Scotland, the 2:00pm repeats were replaced with broadcasts of BBC Scotland's own schools series Over the Moon with Mr. Boom. *Episode 1: Number 1 (20 September 1993)BBC Two England - 20 September 1993 - BBC Genome The Narrator proudly presents Nursery Rhyme Theatre No. 1 - Little Miss Muffet with several interruptions, and Little Jack Horner has one minute to Find 1 Plum on Sammy Sallow's game show of the same name; if he succeeds, he can choose one prize - one mountain bike, or one computer, or one picture of Sallow.

Also, because this episode was the last in the series, Lolita did not tell the viewers that she would \\"see them next Numbertime\\". *Writer: Christopher Lillicrap *Cast: Tony Bluto, Joanna Brookes, Regina Freedman, Jenny Jules, Andy McEwan, Mo Sesay *El Nombre voices (uncredited): Sophie Aldred, Kate Robbins, Steve Steen *Education Officer: Su Hurrell *Music: Andrew Dodge *Animation: Ealing Animation, Hedley Griffin, Peter Lang, Alan Rogers, Marcus Parker-Rhodes *Film Camera: Nick Squires *Film Sound: Eric Wisby, John Hooper *Film Editor: Nick Hutchings *Vision Mixers: Carol Abbott, Hilary Briegel *Camera Supervisor: Eric Metcalfe *Resource Co-ordinator: Roxanna White *Studio Lighting: Bryn Edwards *Studio Sound: Martin Deane *Costume Design: Colin Lavers *Make-up Design: Jane Walker *Videotape Editor: John O'Connor *Assistant Floor Manager: Sally Bates *Production Manager: Oliver Cookson *Production Assistants: Amarjit Ram, Hilary Hardaker *Design: Bob Steer *Executive Producer: Judy Whitfield *Director: Andrea Christodoulou *Series Producer: Clare Elstow *¬© BBC Education MCMXCIII In 1994, BBC Enterprises (now BBC Worldwide) released a video entitled \\"Number Time\\" (BBCV 5359, and spelled with two words), containing sixty minutes of edited highlights from this series (it was the only one at the time); it was later rereleased as the second half of a \\"two- on-one\\" video in 1997 with the Words and Pictures \\"Alphabet Fun Time\\" video (BBCV 5357), which had originally been released at around the same time and contained fifty-eight minutes of highlights from that show's 1992 series (the \\"two-on-one\\" video in question was entitled \\"Alphabet Fun Time and Number Time\\", BBCV 5987, and it was rereleased in 1999). This series was later re- released in full as a \\"Video Plus Pack\\" in 1996 - only slightly altered to remove the episodes' opening titles. From 22 September to 1 December 1998, the BBC broadcast a \\"revised\\" version of this series as a lead-in to the sixth series; in place of Lolita, Bill (introduced in the fourth series) and Bernie (who joined him in the fifth one) introduced each episode with a number line of their own (however, Lolita's voice was still heard narrating some re-used animated sketches). All except seven of the original live-action sketches were replaced with the Dolls' House (again, see Series 5) ones - and the El Nombre sketches were slightly lengthened. Sequences of children discussing the ten numbers (in the vein of those discussing the time-related concepts covered by the fifth series) were also introduced; although the Planet of the Eights sketch was also re-used, the vocal track was redubbed and Lolita was edited out of it. Series 2: Shapes (Spring 1995)  The second series, which is again aimed at four- to five-year-olds, comprised five episodes, focusing on the four basic two-dimensional shapes; each episode would open with Lolita standing by a mobile with the four basic shapes hanging from it and singing the series' main theme, Squares and Triangles, Circles and Rectangles as the mobile began to turn. Once it had stopped turning, she would walk over to the shape that was nearest to her, then ask the viewers if they knew what it was, before it lit up and she told them - and from this series onwards, El Nombre was given two sketches per episode (the first to show Juan instances of that week's shape around the town, with Juan being clumsy and getting confronted by the other villagers after El Nombre had left, and the second to draw it in the desert sand). This series also featured four cut-out animated characters made up from the shapes its episodes were focusing on (a circular man with magical powers, a square robot with transformation powers, a triangular knight with a magical lance and a rectangular man); in the last episode, they worked together to build a house (after the rectangular man built one entirely out of rectangles, and the square robot, triangular knight and circular man transformed them into their own shapes). Each episode would end with Lolita singing an \\"extended\\" version of a song that had been heard earlier in the episode during a montage of the shape around the real world (for the last one, she continued over the credits) and setting viewers the challenge of seeing how many of that week's shape they could find before the next episode. The first two episodes of this series were, again, originally aired as part of the Daytime on Two strand on Mondays at 9:45am, but 8 May 1995 was the year's May Day, so its third episode was aired the following day; the last two episodes were also aired on Mondays. *Episode 11: Circles (24 April 1995)BBC Two England - 24 April 1995 - BBC Genome El Nombre shows Juan what a circle is (with a cart's wheel, a hoopla ring and a hoop with its stick), while a man named Terry introduces the world-famous \\"Ring a Ring o' Roses Formation Dance Team\\" (and their manager, Cynthia) on Come Prancing, and a prehistoric couple try to invent the round wheel (after the square and triangular ones) for their car for Great Moments in History; also, in this episode's second cut-out animated sketch, circular pawprints transform into a circular ladybird, a circular bird, a circular caterpillar (that becomes a circular butterfly), a circular fish which blows circular bubbles, a circular car which emits circular smoke from its circular exhaust, a circular man's head, and a circular bear (and in its CGI animated sketch, a circle gains two additional planes and proceeds to transform into a beach ball, a football, an orange and the planet Earth). *Episode 12: Squares (1 May 1995)BBC Two England - 1 May 1995 - BBC Genome El Nombre shows Juan what a square is (with the then-unnamed Pedro and Juanita's frame, the then-also-unnamed Se√±or Manuel and Se√±or Chipito's draughts board, The Maggot and Cactus saloon's sign and a blackboard), while Bobby Cube asks the Shape Spotters on Let's Shape Up to name the square by pointing out its distinguishing features, a square robot builds a square dog (which turns on him after catching his scent, but he scares it away by transforming into a much bigger square dog with a big square that he runs to and climbs up), and Jill Scoop reports on Old King Cole who is wanting his square bowl (after round, triangular and rectangular ones) for Newsdesk; also, for this episode's CGI animated sketch, the yellow square in the bottom-right of a gameboard rises out of it to become a cube and has the numbers 1-6 written on each of its sides (which proceed to transform into six groups of dots of those respective numbers as the cube becomes the dice in a game of Snakes and Ladders). *Episode 13: Triangles (9 May 1995)BBC Two England - 9 May 1995 - BBC Genome El Nombre shows Juan what a triangle is (with a musical triangle, a roadworks sign and a stepladder), while Aladdin finds the lamp with a triangle on it (after the ones with a circle and square on them) for his Uncle Abanazer, but he wastes its three wishes (one for each of the triangle's sides and corners) by turning Abanazer into a cat, and himself into a mouse, as well as making it disappear (which causes Abanazer to turn on him, but they both questioned why there was not a Genie in the lamp when asked); a triangular knight also sets out to slay a triangular dragon (but gets burned to a crisp the first attempt, and gets rained on along with the triangular dragon's fire getting put out the second attempt) while Bobby Cube asks the Shape Spotters on Let's Shape Up (who are the same ones from the previous episode, but have swapped positions) to identify the triangle (again, by pointing out its distinguishing features to them). Also, for this episode's CGI animated sketch, a triangle has a dotted line drawn inside it, then folds up to become a triangular-based pyramid, and rotates to show the numbers 1-4 on its sides as they light up before unfolding back into a triangle again. *Episode 14: Rectangles (15 May 1995)BBC Two England - 15 May 1995 - BBC Genome El Nombre shows Juan what a rectangle is (with a plank of wood, the cart's side and the then-still-unnamed Pedro and Juanita's piece of cardboard), while Sammy Shape pays a visit to Old Mother Hubbard's cottage to find out \\"what makes a rectangle a rectangle\\" for Shapewatch (which, like the Crime Spot sketch from the previous series, is a spoof of Crimewatch) and met by her dog (who, as in the nursery rhyme, wants a bone, but they find a rectangular biscuit instead), a rectangular man goes for a swim at a swimming pool (after walking up a staircase, taking an elevator and walking up another staircase), Humpty Dumpty is asked to identify the shape of one of the bricks in the wall he is sitting on (which he does just before he falls), and a woman named Jane keeps in touch with her grandmother by writing a rectangular letter, posting it into a postbox which has a rectangular slot and door, then arriving at her house after she receives it. *Episode 15: Shapes Together (22 May 1995)BBC Two England - 22 May 1995 - BBC Genome El Nombre helps Juan remember which shape is which (with the square frame, the circular hoop with its stick, a rectangular book and the triangular roadworks sign), while the rectangular man, the square robot, the triangular knight, and the circular man (who now has a circular body and a wheel for a foot) work together to build a house (after the rectangular man built one entirely out of rectangles, and the square robot, triangular knight and circular man transformed them into their own shapes) and show that \\"all different shapes work well together\\", Bobby Cube asks the Shape Spotters on Let's Shape Up to identify the \\"Shy Shapes\\" hiding in a cola can and Battenberg cake, and a rectangle folds up to become a hollow cylinder as two circles cover its ends and a second rectangle wraps itself around it as it becomes a can of baked beans; also, in this episode's second El Nombre sketch, Juan draws \\"El Nombre\\" (a square, rectangle, circle, and triangle stacked on top of each other), before drawing \\"the rope that hits him on the head and knocks him over\\". El Nombre then says that it has never happened to him - so Juan swings a rope at him, and tells him \\"It has now!\\". The sombrero-less El Nombre then chases Juan through the streets of the town to an extended version of his theme song (with the new tagline \\"Drawing shapes in the desert sand\\" at the end), but he never catches him; this is also the only old-style episode to only have one live-action sketch in it (rather than two or three). *Cast: Gary Beadle, Carolyn Bonnyman, Mike Hayley, Anastasia Mulrooney, Ren√© Zagger *Written by: Christopher Lillicrap *El Nombre voices (uncredited): Sophie Aldred, Kate Robbins, Steve Steen *Music: Mark Blackledge, Andrew Dodge, Sue Herrod/Se√°n de Paor *Animations: Baxter Hobbins Slides Ltd, Ealing Animation, Frameline, Alan Rogers & Peter Lang *Studio Resources Manager: Steve Lowry *Camera Supervisor: John Hoare *Sound: Dave Goodwin *Lighting Director: Geoff Beech *Costume Design: Rosie Cheshire *Make- up Design: Judith Gill-Dougherty *Vision Mixer: Carol Abbott *Assistant Floor Manager: Sally Bates *Graphic Designer: Ellen Monaghan *Set Designer: Eric Walmsley *Videotape Editor: St. John O'Rorke *Executive Producer: Stacey Adams *Studio Director: Phil Chilvers *Production Team: Debby Black, Su Hurrell *Producer: Kristin Mason *¬© BBC Education MCMXCV In 1996, both this series and the next series were released on VHS as \\"Video Plus Packs\\" by BBC Educational Publishing (now BBC Active); the following year, they were also rereleased together as a double \\"Video Plus Pack\\" named \\"Numbertime Shapes/Side by Side\\". After the corporate change in 1997, BBC Education's then-current Internet address (http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/) was superimposed onto the four shapes (a red circle, a green triangle, a yellow square and a blue rectangle) seen at the end of this series' episodes, as well as the thirteen episodes of the next two series; however, it was never added to the end of the first series' episodes. Series 3: Side by Side (Autumn 1995, broadcast Spring 1996)BFI - Numbertime: Side by Side (1995) The third series (which is, once again, aimed at four- to five-year-olds) comprised five episodes, focusing on the concept of prepositions; each episode would open with Lolita singing the series' main theme, Under, Over, Everywhere (the mobile from the previous series was also visible in the background, but it now had an apple, three stickmen, a rainbow, a cloud with a hot-air balloon, a sun, a snake, a spider and a snail hanging from it). In this series, Juan gained three new friends named Pedro Gonzales, Juanita Conchita, and Maria Consuela Tequila Chiquita (Pedro and Juanita had also previously appeared in the second series), as well as a pet tarantula named Tanto - and each episode would end with Lolita reciting a rhyme or singing a song (but the one of the second episode was an extended version of one that had been heard in voiceover earlier in the episode during an animated sketch about a fox). A sketch in the second episode of this series also parodied EastEnders as \\"GreenGrocers\\"; this was also the first series to credit the El Nombre voice actors at the end of its last episode (Sophie Aldred, who had played Ace on Doctor Who as well as one of the presenters of Words and Pictures, Spitting Image impressionist Kate Robbins, who had also voiced Jemima Wellington-Green on Round the Bend, and Steve Steen, who had played Lord Byron in Ink and Incapability, the second episode of Blackadder the Third). Although this series was made in Autumn 1995, it was not broadcast until 28 February 1996. This series and the next one were originally aired on Wednesdays in the Daytime on Two strand at 10:25am; this series also premiered after a rerun of the second one finished, and the next one premiered when Daytime on Two returned after a two-week Easter break. *Episode 16: Up, Down, On, and Off (28 February 1996)BBC Two England - 28 February 1996 - BBC Genome Juan does not have anything to do for the school concert so El Nombre tells him that he can recite Incy Wincy Spider with Tanto, a bear flies a kite (but it comes down in a tree, so he has to climb it to retrieve it), a window cleaner is annoyed by the incompetence of her colleague, Juan recites Incy Wincy Spider at the school concert (but Tanto will not come down the drainpipe, so El Nombre has to coax him) and three clowns named Boris, Doris and Ethel compete to see which one can raise the biggest laugh in Give Us a Giggle. *Episode 17: In Front of, Behind, Before, and After (6 March 1996)BBC Two England - 6 March 1996 - BBC Genome Juan wants to take a photograph of himself and Mama together (but cannot because he is behind the Polaroid), an engine driver pulls some wagons behind (but the coupling snaps when he goes up a hill, so when they roll back down they are in front of him, and he has to signal for the driver of a second engine to help him), Jack and Jill must take Farmer Giles's horse and cart to market in Happy Ever After, a fox hides in his secret lair to escape a hunt (accompanied by a rhyme from Lolita in voiceover), Juan still does not have a photograph of himself and Mama together (so El Nombre takes it himself and blows himself up in the process), and the proprietor of GreenGrocers tries to get his four customers of the day to stand behind his stall and form a proper queue (until he gets upstaged by a toy salesman). *Episode 18: Under, Over, On Top of, and Beneath (13 March 1996)BBC Two England - 13 March 1996 - BBC Genome Juan cannot score a goal past Pedro so El Nombre (who is not seen in his usual outfit in this episode, but what would later become Santo Flamingo United's strip) tells him to kick the ball over him, Princess Perfect wants a bed fit for a princess (in the sense of not being able to feel a pea under the mattress), a tortoise named Toby goes to a party but cannot get over the hedge to it (unlike the four other guests of a bird, a frog, a squirrel and a rabbit, but the last of them tells him to go under the hedge instead), Pedro is standing on a stool so Juan again cannot score past him (until El Nombre tells him to kick the ball under him, and when Pedro objects, they reduce the size of the goal, but El Nombre whispers to Juan to kick the ball to one side of Pedro before he leaves), and the Cow (of Hey Diddle Diddle) is scared of having to jump over the Moon (so the Little Dog volunteers the Dish instead, but he suggests running under it). *Episode 19: Beside, Around, and Between (20 March 1996)BBC Two England - 20 March 1996 - BBC Genome Mama wants to go to Hurrell's store but there is a hole in the ground in front of it (so El Nombre and Juan tell her to walk around it), a doll pushes three building blocks with the numbers 1-3 on them together (but a breakdown-truck-driving clown accidentally crashes into them and scatters them, so he has to help her rearrange them again), Darren and Sharon Jam cannot make a mutual decision on where to put their new table on Lucky Lottery Winners, Mama has come out of Hurrell's store (but cannot help thinking there is another way around the hole, so El Nombre tells her that if she is brave like him, she can jump across it, but when he falls down it, she opts to go around it again instead), and Lord and Lady Posh give instructions to their gardener, Jarvis, on where he has to plant their roses and daisies. *Episode 20: In, Out, and Through (27 March 1996)BBC Two England - 27 March 1996 - BBC Genome Juan has lost Tanto so El Nombre helps him and Mama to find him, the bear from the first episode tries to boil a saucepan of water over a fire but its bottom is missing, a magician turns her volunteer's watch and keys into an alarm clock and one big key, and two burglars named Bob and Bert break into a sweet shop and eat all the sweets but grow too fat to escape through the window so they get caught by a policeman named PC Nabb;

each episode would open with Lolita singing the series' main theme, More or Less, in a studio filled with pillars. This series introduced the character of Bill (voiced by Paul Cawley), a green bird who could swallow and regurgitate almost any object whole - and from the fifth series onwards, he was joined by a purple cat named Bernie (voiced by Laura Brattan), later going on to appear at the beginning of each \\"revised\\" first-, sixth- and seventh-series episode. This series also featured a toad named Test, who would hop along the heads of fifteen multicoloured people lined up to form a numberline by the amounts its episodes were focusing on (they all wore red jumpers with the numbers 1-15 on them, but when Test was on their heads, the colour of their jumpers would change to green); each episode would end with Lolita singing a song (for the last one, she again continued over the credits, and it was also her final appearance, but because she did not know that she would be relieved of her presenting duties back then, she still told the viewers that she would \\"see them next Numbertime\\"). Two sketches in the first and seventh episodes of this series also parodied Percy Thrower and Sir David Attenborough as \\"Percy Grower\\" and \\"David Attencoat\\", while a third one in the third episode parodied Surprise, Surprise as \\"What a Surprise\\" (with Cinderella receiving a surprise visit from her Fairy Godmother) - and the Bill sketches of the second and sixth episodes also featured an enormous (but unnamed) beetle who chased after Bill after putting his feet into the eight wellingtons he regurgitated (in the second episode) and fell on top of him after pulling his last two wellingtoned legs up off a wall he was standing in front of (in the sixth episode), while the one of the fourth episode featured a \\"female\\" version of Bill who fell on top of him after he shook twenty mangoes off a tree. In the El Nombre sketches of the seventh and last episodes, Juan had his fifth birthday for the second time (only this time, Pedro, Juanita and Maria all brought him an extra candle for his cake because he was one year older, so he ended up with eight), and El Nombre's town gained a female mayor who also happened to be a balloon seller named Se√±ora Fedora. *Episode 21: One More (17 April 1996)BBC Two England - 17 April 1996 - BBC Genome A little old woman, a little old man and their little old cat enlist the help of one more friend (the Little Old Mouse) to help pull up their enormous turnip for Growing Bigger, Little Juan needs to play two cymbals (not one), Test hops from 3 to 7, contestant Sharon plays Find One More in order to win two prizes the same, Bill adds four flowers together and Juan needs to hit the cymbals one more time (to make four hits);

given that Lolita had been relieved of her presenting duties by this point, each episode was introduced by an animated man with a pocket watch for a head (who also appeared in a musical sketch at the end of the sixth episode). In this series, El Nombre's town was given the name of Santo Flamingo (its name was first heard in the sixth episode in reference to their local football team, although the sign above the doorway of its newly built school read \\"San Flamingo School\\"),YouTube - El Nombre Single and Juan gained a new teacher named Constanza Bonanza - and all except two of the episodes had sketches featuring a rarely speaking man named Tim (played by Toby Jones) who was coming to an understanding with time-related concepts (in fact, the only time he spoke was in the seventh episode, when he read out the text \\"Cook for half an hour\\" on the box of a big pie he had bought). This series also introduced the recurring sketch of the Dolls' House, which featured a cowgirl named Annie (played by Victoria Gay), a scarecrow named Scrap (played by Paul Cawley), a robot named Glimmer (played by Ashley Artus with a Geordie accent), a clock named Ticker (played by Mike Hayley), and from the sixth series onwards, a butler named Branston (played by Brian Miller); they were frequently visited by a pirate named Captain Kevin (played by Roger Griffiths), and on three occasions by a mechanic named Megamax (played by Fidel Nanton), Glimmer's girlfriend Princess Penelope (who had come to visit Scrap when he was ill and ate all his chocolates) and a Russian ballet dancer named Nadia Nokoblokov (who had come to perform Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin's Minute Waltz). For the seventh series, they were also frequently visited by a detective named Shelley Holmes (played by Issy Van Randwyck) - however, this recurring sketch would only go on until the end of that series. Although this series was made after the corporate change in Winter 1997 (as evidenced by the then-new BBC logo at the end of each episode), it was not broadcast until 13 January 1998. This series and the next one were originally aired on Tuesdays as part of the then- newly renamed Schools Programmes strand at 9:45am. *Episode 29: Night and Day (13 January 1998)BBC Two England - 13 January 1998 - BBC Genome In this first new-style episode, Tim wakes up in the middle of the night, brushes his teeth and pours himself a bowl of corn flakes (but has to wait until the morning for the milk), Little Juan wakes up all the other villagers because he does not know that a fiesta is held in the evening (rather than the morning or the afternoon), the residents of the Dolls' House take turns in getting their meals ready and Bill takes a Polaroid of both himself and his new co-star Bernie (who came in covered in mud, so he has to give her a bath before taking another one), but Bill got himself covered in mud while trying to get her in the bath, so she takes another Polaroid of him to show him. *Episode 30: Days of the Week (20 January 1998)BBC Two England - 20 January 1998 - BBC Genome Tim sets off to referee a football match (but the forecast for that day is \\"windy\\", so he has to change into his best suit), Little Juan has football practice but cannot remember which day it is on, Bill decides to go on holiday to get away from the rain (but leaves Bernie behind with only seven cans of cat food, one for each day of the week, and a can opener) and Scrap and Glimmer get into an argument over a teddy bear so Captain Kevin has to sort it out; also, not only is the newspaper in this episode's Tim sketch dated from before the BBC's corporate change (10 April 1997), but it is factually incorrect, as it says that day was a Monday, when it was in fact a Thursday. *Episode 31: Sequencing Events (27 January 1998)BBC Two England - 27 January 1998 - BBC Genome Tim tries to put on his new suit with a jacket, a pair of trousers, a hat, a pair of shoes, a pair of socks and a tie but keeps doing it in the wrong order, El Nombre helps Mama to make Delietta Smith (who is obviously a parody of Delia Smith)'s wonderful omelette with red and green peppers, Bill wakes Bernie up for dinnertime but forgets all about the food, and Scrap and Glimmer try to make a chocolate splodge cake for Annie; this is also the first episode to refer to the Dolls' House by name, despite being the third one in this series. *Episode 32: Comparison of Time (3 February 1998)BBC Two England - 3 February 1998 - BBC Genome Tim grows two flowers and photographs them but cannot wait for the third, Pedro bets Juan he can find a spider who is faster than Tanto, Bernie wants to get an apple off a tree but cannot reach it (so Bill offers to fly up there, but when he learns he cannot, he challenges her to a tower-building contest) and Megamax is coming for tea at the Dolls' House so Annie, Scrap and Glimmer have to paint it, but the latter runs down, so when Megamax arrives, he deduces that he needs a new battery and gives him the \\"Max Pack Turbo Booster\\" to fix him. *Episode 33: Clock Face (10 February 1998)BBC Two England - 10 February 1998 - BBC Genome El Nombre helps Little Juan to find out some things about the clock face for his homework, Scrap and Glimmer are bored so they decide to give Ticker's spring a big clean, and Bill trips over the sleeping Bernie and flies into his clock, causing all its numbers and both its hands to fall off; when he has put them all back on (with the help of Bernie), the clock's cuckoo calls at 3:00 and causes him to faint. *Episode 34: O'Clock (24 February 1998)BBC Two England - 24 February 1998 - BBC Genome Little Juan and his friends prepare to go on a school outing to see Santo Flamingo United playing in the cup final at 3:00, Bernie takes a nap at 2:00 but Bill plays a prank on her by moving the clock an hour ahead and waking her up by replacing the cuckoo, and Scrap waits for the postwoman to deliver his new \\"Scrap Jacket\\" (which he had been going on about all night and keeping Glimmer from getting sleep). *Episode 35: Half Past (3 March 1998)BBC Two England - 3 March 1998 - BBC Genome Tim (saying his only line, \\"Cook for half an hour\\", in this episode) cooks a big pie he has bought, but gets bored while waiting so eats all his other groceries, Scrap is ill so Annie asks Glimmer to take his temperature every hour and give him his medicine every half-hour (but his girlfriend, Princess Penelope, comes to visit), Bernie is enjoying a \\"cattuccino\\" at the foot of a Big Ben-like clock tower until Bill bungee-jumps from its minute hand, steals it when he springs back up to its face, drinks it and returns the empty cup to her, and Pedro, Juanita, and Maria all agree to meet Juan for a game of football at 2:30 (but Juan wonders how he will know when it is 2:30). *Episode 36: Timing of Events (10 March 1998)BBC Two England - 10 March 1998 - BBC Genome Tim has hiccups and tries to get rid of them by drinking a glass of water then holding his breath for ten seconds (but gets interrupted by a crank phone call the first time, and a crank door-caller the second time), San Flamingo School is holding a three-legged race as a part of their sports day, Bill and Bernie prepare to launch each other into outer space using only a seesaw, and Nadia Nokoblokov comes to visit the Dolls' House because she needs someone to help her out with her new dance (Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin's Minute Waltz). *Episode 37: Months and Seasons (17 March 1998)BBC Two England - 17 March 1998 - BBC Genome Tim receives a mysterious three-layered parcel on his doorstep in the middle of the night (which turns out to be a birthday cake) along with a musical birthday card (which plays a high-speed version of Happy Birthday to You to him), while El Nombre helps Juan and Juanita to put the four seasons in the right order for their homework (but they still have to draw a picture for each one), Bernie puts a smile on the face of a snowman (that turns out to be Bill) in winter, then the snow melts and some blossom grows on a tree in spring, Bill waters some flowers to help them grow and Bernie mows the lawn in summer, the leaves blow off the tree in autumn and Bernie throws a snowball at Bill and skates on the ice in winter before putting another smile on the face of another snowman (which, again, is Bill); the residents of the Dolls' House also have to organise their clothes for each season (but Glimmer thinks they are throwing them away). *Episode 38: Telling the Time (24 March 1998)BBC Two England - 24 March 1998 - BBC Genome In his last appearance, Tim is woken up by a train, then eats a bowl of corn flakes, drinks a cup of coffee and builds a house of cards as three more trains pass (the last one causes him to knock it down), Ticker is broken because Annie, Scrap and Glimmer did not oil him when he asked so Captain Kevin gives him one of his spare ship's bells as a replacement, Bill and Bernie test each other's knowledge of time with their clock (and Bill gets two of them wrong), and Miss Constanza Bonanza, Pedro, Juanita and Mama all remind Juan that it is choir practice at 4:30, it is football practice at 5:00, to come to her house for tea at 5:30, and to return home at 6:00 respectively. *Writers: Andrew Bernhardt, Toby Jones, Christopher Lillicrap *Cast: Ashley Artus, Paul Cawley, Victoria Gay, Roger Griffiths, Mike Hayley, Tania Levey, Fidel Nanton, Issy Van Randwyck (Dolls' House), Toby Jones (Tim), Sophie Aldred, Kate Robbins, Steve Steen (El Nombre) *Bill and Bernie (uncredited): Laura Brattan, Paul Cawley *Music: Neil Ben, Mark Blackledge, Andrew Dodge, Richard Durrant, Derek Nash, Sandy Nuttgens *Animations: Ealing Animation, Alan Rogers & Peter Lang, Ian Sachs *Studio Resources Manager: Steve Lowry *Sound: Dave Goodwin *Lighting: Alan Jeffery *Assistant Floor Manager: Alice Oldfield *Costume Design: Rosie Cheshire *Make-Up Design: Judith Gill-Dougherty *Graphic Designer: Anne Smith *Set Designer: Gina Parr *Editor: St. John O'Rorke *Education Officer: Su Hurrell *Production Team: Helen Chase, Karen Keith, Debby Black *Studio Director: Phil Chilvers *Executive Producer: Anne Brogan *Producer: Kristin Mason *¬© BBC MCMXCVII The four shapes seen at the end of this series' episodes had been redesigned from those of the three previous ones, and were differently coloured to their originals as well (the circle was now green, the triangle was now yellow and the square was now red, but the rectangle kept its old-style colour of blue); also, in 1999, this series was released on VHS as a \\"Video Plus Pack\\" by BBC Educational Publishing. Series 6: Numbers 11 to 20 (Winter 1998, broadcast Spring 1999)BFI - Numbertime: Numbers 11-20 (1998) The sixth series (which is, again, aimed at five- to six-year-olds) comprised five episodes focusing on the numbers 11, 12, 15, 17 and 20, in order; they did not cover the numbers 13, 14, 16, 18 and 19 (except in their opening titles with images of thirteen blocks, fourteen pencils, sixteen leaves, eighteen buttons and nineteen crayons). Each episode would open with Bill and Bernie finding the position of the episode's number on their number line (which had been carried over from the \\"revised\\" version of the first series that was produced in 1998) - and in this series, Santo Flamingo gained an ice-cream seller named Se√±or Gelato, a carpenter named Se√±or Chipito (who had, once again, previously appeared in the second series as the owner of \\"The Maggot and Cactus\\" saloon) and a bandit named Don Fandango (who stole twenty gold coins from its newly built bank, which was managed by Se√±or Calculo, in the last episode). This series also saw former Blue Peter host Janet Ellis joining the El Nombre cast; although this series was made in Winter 1998, it was not broadcast until 12 January 1999. *Episode 39: Number 11 (12 January 1999)BBC Two England - 12 January 1999 - BBC Genome Eleven soldiers (ten in two rows of five and the eleventh on the bottom) march around and ten of them make up the number eleven, Little Juan and his friends are preparing to go on a second school outing, this time to play a football match (but they only have ten football shirts, and El Nombre writes the episode's number in the desert sand), and Scrap receives a \\"Soccerbox\\" football game from his great-aunt Laura Litterbin (but it disappoints him as he does not like football, and one of the eleven white players goes missing). *Episode 40: Number 12 (19 January 1999)BBC Two England - 19 January 1999 - BBC Genome Now in song, a pair of green slugs eat a gardener's twelve plants (that are in three rows of four) and make the number twelve, Juan bets Juanita that he can do more skips than her (he also mistakenly pronounces her surname as \\"Chiquita\\" in this episode) and Pedro bets both of them he can do more than either of them (but when doing it, he counts as fast as he can), and Captain Kevin does not want Branston to mention the number twelve as it reminds him of the final voyage of the good ship Rusty Bucket (when its crew found twelve biscuits). *Episode 41: Number 15 (26 January 1999)BBC Two England - 26 January 1999 - BBC Genome Fifteen cars (in three rows of five) go nowhere and nobody seems to care, Se√±or Gelato accidentally drives his ice-cream tricycle into a three-legged table that Mama had told Juan and Pedro to take in to Se√±or Chipito for repairing (and they have to get a replacement wheel with fifteen spokes, but Juan initially thinks that it has more as he cannot tell which one he had started counting from), and Scrap and Glimmer are playing marbles in the lounge of the Dolls' House (but Glimmer is losing, rather badly, and his ten red marbles go missing). *Episode 42: Number 17 (2 February 1999)BBC Two England - 2 February 1999 - BBC Genome Seventeen windows (sixteen of them in four rows of four and the seventeenth one on the door) open up on a flat to let in some air, Pedro accidentally kicks his ball into the path of Se√±or Gelato's ice-cream tricycle (which causes him to swerve and crash into Se√±or Manuel's cart, upsetting his display of seventeen tomatoes) while playing football with Juan, and all the residents of the Dolls' House prepare a surprise party for Captain Kevin but Scrap eats three lots of cake mix that is supposed to be enough for twenty cakes leaving seventeen. *Episode 43: Number 20 (9 February 1999)BBC Two England - 9 February 1999 - BBC Genome A spaceship beams up twenty stars (that are in four rows of five) then beams them down again in the constellation of the number twenty, Don Fandango steals twenty gold coins from the bank of Santo Flamingo (but Tanto bites a hole in his bag causing them all to fall out), and Nadia Nokoblokov pays another visit to the Dolls' House to perform another dance (\\"The Dance of Twenty Turns\\") in its conservatory; however, Ticker (whose role in the Dolls' House sketches had been lessened by this point) realises that if he stays in the bedroom, he does not have to watch, and Scrap eats a cake he had been told to put twenty candles on so Annie and Nadia punish him by putting him on the revolving podium that Nadia had brought with her for the dance and telling Glimmer to force him to do twenty \\"fast\\" turns on it. Clips from the first series (both incarnations) and the fourth series were also re-used in a musical sketch at the end of this episode. *Writers: Andrew Bernhardt, Christopher Lillicrap *Cast: Ashley Artus, Laura Brattan, Paul Cawley, Victoria Gay, Roger Griffiths, Mike Hayley, Tania Levey, Brian Miller *El Nombre cast: Sophie Aldred, Janet Ellis, Kate Robbins, Steve Steen *Music: Neil Ben, Mark Blackledge, Andrew Dodge, Richard Durrant, Derek Nash, Sandy Nuttgens *Animations: Ealing Animation, Alan Rogers and Peter Lang *Studio Resources Manager: Steve Lowry *Camera Supervisor: Roger Goss *Sound Supervisor: Dave Goodwin *Lighting Director: Alan Rixon *Vision Mixer: Hilary Briegel *Floor Manager: Tom Hood *Assistant Floor Manager: Alice Oldfield *Costume Designer: Rosie Cheshire *Make-Up Designer: Judith Gill-Dougherty *Graphic Designer: Tom Brooks *Set Designer: Gina Parr *Videotape Editor: David Austin *Education Officer: Jenny Towers *Executive Producer: Clare Elstow *Studio Director: Robin Carr *Production Team: Debby Black, Liz Holmes *Producer: Kristin Mason *¬© BBC MCMXCVIII In 2000, both this series and the following one were released on VHS as \\"Video Plus Packs\\" by BBC Educational Publishing; on 4 May 2012, this one was rereleased on DVD as a \\"DVD Plus Pack\\" by BBC Active, with an accompanying teachers' book.

Series 7: Numbers up to 100 (Autumn/Winter 1999) The seventh series, which is once again aimed at five- to six-year-olds, comprised five episodes focusing on how to add and identify two-figure numbers up to 100; each episode would open with Bill and Bernie, whose number line had been replaced by a number square, and joined by a caterpillar named Limo (voiced by Peter Temple), who would crawl around the square to count out the numbers they required. In Santo Flamingo, Maria's sister Pepita Consuela Tequila Chiquita also started at San Flamingo School.

Scrap has also lost all except one of his fifty buttons so Shelley Holmes helps him to find them again, while Se√±or Gelato has only one cornet left so Juan volunteers to go down to Hurrell's store and get twenty-four more - but as he is about to set off, he is asked to get three extra ones. *Episode 45: Missing Numbers (11 November 1999)BBC Two England - 11 November 1999 - BBC Genome While dusting the number square, Bernie sneezes four of the numbers (18, 46, 69 and 83) out of it; after Limo has put them all back in, Bernie dusts Bill's beak, causing him to sneeze the entire number square over. Maria's sister Pepita also starts at San Flamingo School (which viewers see the inside of for the first time), while Glimmer cooks apple pie and custard (his Aunt Dimity's very own recipe) but Scrap has got the pages of his cookbook mixed up and Limo has to put four more numbers (24, 38, 77 and 96) back into the number square. *Episode 46: Counting in Tens (18 November 1999)BBC Two England - 18 November 1999 - BBC Genome Bernie is tired so she decides to have forty winks, and Limo counts them by crawling along each row of the number square; Scrap is also tired of licking envelopes (containing invitations to Glimmer's birthday party), while Juan takes all the money that he has saved up in his donkey bank to Santo Flamingo Bank and Bill and Bernie ask Limo if he can find the numbers 30 and 90 and add on ten. *Episode 47: Patterns of Ten (25 November 1999)BBC Two England - 25 November 1999 - BBC Genome Bill makes twelve sandwiches and ten iced buns for a party (and Bernie makes ten more of both, but they both make ten rock cakes each), while Scrap and Glimmer are making party bags for a party of their own, Se√±ora Fedora opens the 15th Annual Santo Flamingo Egg Festival and chooses Mama to make its giant omelette (for which she needs sixty-one eggs but only has twenty- one) and Bill and Bernie eat thirty of the \\"goodies\\" that they have made for their party, but Bill drops the ten remaining buns and Bernie slides on their remains into him causing him to drop ten of the sandwiches, and when they decide to have a dance he throws the ten of the remaining twelve into the air. *Episode 48: Patterns of Five (2 December 1999)BBC Two England - 2 December 1999 - BBC Genome Bill has been shopping and bought twenty packs of five fish fingers (but forgot the chips, as Bernie finds out once she has put them all in the freezer), while Glimmer is painting a five-dot pattern, and San Flamingo School is holding a jumble sale; this was also the final episode to feature the Dolls' House (and although it credits Victoria Gay at the end of it, she did not appear as Annie in this series). *Writers: Andrew Bernhardt, Christopher Lillicrap *Cast: Ashley Artus, Laura Brattan, Paul Cawley, Victoria Gay, Roger Griffiths, Mike Hayley, Brian Miller, Issy Van Randwyck, Peter Temple *El Nombre cast: Sophie Aldred, Janet Ellis, Kate Robbins, Steve Steen *Music: Neil Ben, Mark Blackledge, Andrew Dodge, Richard Durrant, Derek Nash, Sandy Nuttgens *Graphics: Anne Smith *Animations: Ealing Animation, Alan Rogers and Peter Lang *Studio Resource Manager: Steve Lowry *Camera Supervisor: Gerry Tivers *Sound Supervisor: Dave Goodwin *Lighting Director: Dave Gibson *Vision Mixer: Carol Abbott *Floor Manager: Tom Hood *Assistant Floor Managers: Beccy Fawcett, Catharine Hartley *Costume Designer: Rosie Cheshire *Make-Up Designer: Judy Gill-Dougherty *Set Designer: Gina Parr *Editor: David Austin *Education Officer: Jenny Towers *Studio Director: Phil Chilvers *Executive Producer: Clare Elstow *Production Team: Clare Arnopp, Debby Black, Debbie Wright *Producer: Kristin Mason *¬© BBC MCMXCIX Series 8: Money (Autumn 2000) The eighth series, which is aimed at five- to seven- year-olds, comprised ten episodes focusing on coin recognition, money problems, coin equivalents and change (which the BBC had previously covered in the second series of their later primary maths show, Megamaths); each episode would open with eight \\"money-spiders\\" (one for each coin - 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, ¬£1 and ¬£2) coming down into view from the top of a tree. In this series, the currency of pounds and pence was introduced to Santo Flamingo, which gained a railway station named El Loco and a pizza delivery boy named Leonardo de Sombrero - and the recurring song from the first series, Numbers All Around, was also reworked (to focus on coins instead of numbers). This series also introduced the recurring sketch of Screensaver, which featured a screen named Screen (voiced by Sue Elliott-Nicholls), a variety of customers (who were all played by one-time Spitting Image impressionist Michael Fenton- Stevens), and a robot named T1L (pronounced \\"Til\\", and played by Paul Vates).

Although The Freewoman published articles on women's waged work, housework, motherhood, the suffrage movement, and literature, its notoriety and influence rested on its frank discussions of sexuality, morality, and marriage. The Freewoman urged tolerance for male homosexuality,Cohler, Deborah. Citizen, Invert, Queer: Lesbianism and War in Early Twentieth Century Britain. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 2010. p.73. advocated for free love, and encouraged women to remain unmarried. The Freewoman's editorial stance distinguished it from the attitude of suffragists like Millicent Fawcett, who was so disturbed at the journal's approach to sexuality that she supposedly tore the first issue into little pieces. Although its circulation probably never exceeded 200, it had a significant influence in Modernist circles. Among its contributors were Rebecca West, H. G. Wells, Edward Carpenter, and Guy Aldred. In March 1912 Gawthorpe resigned due to poor health and disagreements with Marsden. In September 1912, W H Smith refused to carry The Freewoman and in October 1912, the journal folded. In June 1913 Marsden started The New Freewoman which was more concerned with literary modernism than feminism and was funded by Harriet Shaw Weaver. In 1914, The New Freewoman became The Egoist. Creation of The Freewoman The Freewoman was a feminist journal/newspaper in publication during the early twentieth century in Britain. Dora Marsden founded The Freewoman in November 1911, but the paper was also co-edited by Mary Gawthorpe. Despite being edited by both women, Gawthorpe's name and influence in the feminist society was used by Marsden to give the paper creditability and popularity. The paper was rooted in more radical feminist ideals that stretched beyond strictly suffrage. Marsden focused the paper around the discussion of sex and the idea of being sexual, causing many issues to arise amongst readers. After the first issue of The Freewoman, the female readers, many of whom grew up during the Victorian era of feminism, thought the views presented did not reflect the ideals of the feminism they had grown to understand. One of their main objectives was the papers very obvious discussions and references to sex. In the paper's first issue it stated that it sought to represent the feminist movement through intellectual thought by actual feminists of the time. It touched on the idea of marriage, motherhood, sexuality, women's rights, and the domestic man. Its radical approach on these ideas seemed misplaced for the twentieth century, however its influence amongst the feminist and sexual radicals was greater than its small circulation implied. The Freewoman ideals According to many of the female readers, The Freewoman expressed beliefs more radical than most feminists during the early twentieth century. In the paper's first issue it discussed the definition of marriage. To The Freewoman marriage did not only mean men and women, nor did it mean that a couple had to have children. To the women who were raised during the Victorian era, this concept of marriage did not register with them. Marriage in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and even in the current day, meant a man and woman and usually resulted in children. However, with the job opportunities and improved possibility of economic and social independence from the years preceding and during the war, women were able to forge a new identity separate from the confines of marriage. As feminism began to grow throughout the twentieth century, the paper began to put a new label on these more radical feminists - 'The New Woman'. The Freewoman began to redefine and transform feminism from being solely related to suffrage and the suffrage movement, but to show feminism in its purest form. It aimed to say that feminists needed to strive for more than just the right to vote. Marsden's rather liberal and forward thinking opinion on the definition of feminism is what caused future debates amongst other prominent feminists of the time. The New Woman was to be a politically, socially and economically independent woman. The Freewoman did not reject the domestic life that most women during the twentieth century lived, but rather used the domestic life of a woman as a tool to show women that they could take an active role in protecting their interests. In the paper's third publication it discussed the idea of the domestic man. It raised the idea that a man can do the work of a woman in the domestic sphere. The goal was to ‚Äúwork towards the evolution of the New Housekeeping.‚Äù Its rationale hinged on the argument that the house and its inner workings were no different from that of a restaurant or even a milliner's shop. The paper also suggested the idea of communal cooking and man and wife dividing up the household duties that would allow women to work outside of the domestic life. This idea of the domestic man also supported the idea of the homosexual family. With a man being able to do the domestic work, it presented the idea that man and man could live as a couple. To say that this openly happened is not likely, however The Freewoman implied and even supported this life style choice. The paper again showed its liberal and progressive beliefs with its idea of the domestic man. The Freewoman stated that: \\"It is high time for a reversal of the servile notion of government from above. Free government proceeds from the individual outwards, not from the sum total inwards. It is for this reason that, considering the trend of Syndicalism, we are of the opinion that it is likely to make a far more intimate appeal to the nation than Socialism ever has. Its aims are the same: the means of production and exchange to be the property of the community as a whole, but under Syndicalism the control of conditions of work are to be in the hands of those who perform it.\\"The Servile State, From the Freewoman, Reproduced in The Syndiacalist, London June 1912 The Big Debate With the papers candid nature of expressing many of its beliefs, there were bound to be arguments. One of it biggest criticisms and continuous debates with some readers came from its stance on the suffrage movement. It openly challenged the ideals of the movement and its organization. Despite being co-edited, these views were mainly the opinions of Marsden and not Gawthorpe. With the paper's belief that feminism was more than just the right to vote, its views on the suffrage movement were unlike most feminists in Britain during the twentieth century. During this era women were fighting for the right to vote and to be regarded as political equals amongst men. Not all feminists believed in complete female independence from the strongholds of the normative female life. The Freewoman wanted to stray away from this concept of feminism. It wanted women to not only be politically equal, but economically and socially self-sufficient as well. It rooted its beliefs in complete female independence from the norms of society. The Closing Years The publication of The Freewoman did not last long. Its final paper was published in 1912, but was later revived in May 1913 with the new title The New Freewoman. Despite the attempts to revive the paper and inspire more readers, the paper finally ended publication in 1914. Its publication did not reach a large market, mostly due to its views on feminism and the suffrage movement. The paper, but more specifically Dora Marsden's beliefs and opinions were far too liberal and progressive for its early twentieth century audience. The audience was still rather conservative in their views. It would not be until the years of the Great War that women began to take small strides in some of the ideals that The Freewoman expressed. Despite having an extremely small circulation, the paper's strong beliefs and opinions were widely known and debated against and provided the impetus for future feminist activists.

Overview FAA-Terminal Area Chart Baltimore-Washington from 2011 Like the VFR sectional charts that they complement, terminal area charts depict topographic features and other information of interest to aviators flying visually, including major landmarks, terrain elevations, visual navigation routes, ground-based navigation aids, airports, rivers, cities, and airspace boundaries. TACs are more detailed than sectional charts, and are scaled at 1:250,000 (as opposed to 1:500,000 for sectional charts) to permit inclusion of more detail. TACs contain information on approach, departure, and transition rules and procedures for the congested Class B areas around major airports. Terminal area charts for the USA are maintained and published by the United States Federal Aviation Administration, and by commercial enterprises (notably Jeppesen) that produce equivalent, certified charts, often with some added value over the government charts, but with a higher price. The reverse side of a paper copy of the TAC often provides a flyway chart, a simplified chart that shows preferred VFR routes through the area covered by the TAC. TACs are updated at six-month intervals.

On 27 November 1871 he was stationed in Cuba with the rank of captain when eight students were executed by the authorities who found them guilty of anti-Spanish activities and of vandalizing some tomb sites. On hearing the news he publicly protested and, for this reason, was expelled from the army but he never apologized or renounced his actions and was always proud of what he did. To this day, in the fa√ßade of the Hotel Inglaterra in Havana, Cuba, there is a plaque bearing his name and commemorating his protest.http://regioncanarias- diariodigital.blogspot.com.es/2014/10/el-centro-de-historia-y-cultura- militar.html Photo of plaque.

They occur mostly in dry, sandy habitats in the deserts of North America, South America, and Australia. Other genera formerly placed in Apioceridae are now in Mydidae. Diversity and biogeography The roughly 150 species of Apiocera are divided into four subgenera, each restricted to a different continent. Apiocera is found in Australia, Ripidosyrma in southern Africa, Pyrocera in North America, and Anypenus in South America. Biology Apiocera species are found in sandy, arid and semiarid habitats. Despite the common name, most Apiocera species never visit flowers, but rather are found running on the ground near sparse vegetation, or feeding on honeydew beneath aphid-infested plants. They are often seen drinking from damp sand with their sponge-like mouthparts. The larvae of Apiocera maritima are found in sand near the high-water mark of coastal beaches.

As the perception of behaviors and actions vary, intercultural competence is essential. However, a lack of knowledge about customs and expectations within African cultures can make even the best intentioned person seem rude, selfish, or worse.  Generalizations  Bangwa sculpture of a female figure with child, carved as a special sign of respect and honor. Although Africa represents an enormous expanse of geography with an incalculable amount of cultures and customs, noting the following points of etiquette can be useful when dealing with people around the world who have been raised according to different African traditions.  Religion  A number of countries in Africa have many traditions based in Islam and share values with other parts of the Muslim world. As such, guidelines regarding etiquette in the Middle East are often applicable to these places. This holds especially true in Muslim majority countries which include many of the West African nations such as Senegal, Chad and Mali. Even though most people would consider themselves as Muslim, many adherents in these areas mix it with local animism. Many, whatever their religious adherence, to some extent believe in supernatural forces and that certain people, primarily doctors, herbalists, diviners, or marabouts (religious figures) have the power to utilise these forces. It is common to see people wearing amulets (called ‚Äúgris-gris‚Äù) around their waist, neck, arms, or legs. People consult with diviners or marabouts to protect themselves against evil spirits, to improve their financial status or bring them love, to cure chronic illnesses, to settle disputes, or to place a curse on another person.Senegal - Etiquette and Customs  Southern Africa  In Southern Africa, it is considered polite to receive a gift with the right hand. In interactions between social classes (e.g. between a young person and an older man) the younger person should not meet the eye of the older (this politeness is perceived as evasiveness by western cultures). It is considered impolite to disappoint an outsider, so queries such as \\"how far is it,\\" can be met with positive sounding answers like \\"it is really close\\" when the destination is very far away. It is polite to pretend agreement with another's point of view, even if there is no agreement. Holding out both hands cupped together is the proper way to respectfully request or beg for a gift.

The charts are published \\"in accordance with Interagency Air Cartographic Committee specifications and agreements, approved by the Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation Administration\\". The legend of an aeronautical chart lists many of the symbols, colors and codes used to convey information to the map reader. General A sectional chart is a two-sided chart created from a Lambert Conformal Conic Projection with two defined standard parallels. The scale is 1:500,000, with a contour interval of 500 feet. The size of each sectional is designed to be \\"arm's width\\" when completely unfolded. The \\"northern\\" half of the section is on one side of the chart, and the \\"southern\\" on the reverse. The edges between north and south are designed with a calibrated overlap that permits plotting extensions of course lines from one side to the other, once the user has scribed a corresponding \\"match line\\" on each side. All other edges are truncated at a predetermined size. White space around the chart is filled with map information and the legend, scales, and tables of airport and airspace information. Terrain is color-coded for its elevation and major roads, cities, and bodies of water are shown for visual reference, as well as other identifiable structures (e.g., stadiums and water towers). However, most of the layers of data on the charts include specific information about obstacles, airspace designations, and facility information (locations, radio frequencies, etc.). The legend divides these into several types of information, namely: airports, radio aids, traffic and airspace services, obstructions, topographic, and miscellaneous. Other unusual features may be designated on the map with symbols that do not appear in the legend, such as areas where laser lights are routinely pointed into the air (a jagged-edged circle), or a wildlife protection area (a solid line with dots along the inside edge). Airports The location of each airport and presence of control towers is indicated with a circle, or with an outline of the hard- surfaced runways (if over 8,069 feet long). Blue shows an airport with a control tower and magenta for others. * Military airstrips (without hard- surface runways) are shown with two concentric circles. * Private airports are shown with the letter \\"R\\" inside a circle. * A heliport is designated with \\"H\\" in a circle. * An unverified airstrip is shown with a \\"U\\" in a circle. * An abandoned airport with paved runways is shown with a circle having an \\"X\\" over it. Airport data Each indicated airport has an airport data block associated with it. The block may contain just the name, altitude and runway length, or any of the following additional information, among others. * Part- time tower operation (a star symbol). * FSS, ATIS/AWOS, CTAF indicators * Control tower, ATIS, UNICOM frequencies, as available * Right traffic pattern alert * Special VFR restrictions * Airport surveillance radar presence * Lighting hour, if any * Elevation in feet (typically at center of longest runway) * Length of longest runway in hundreds of feet Radio Aids and Communication Boxes * Beacon locations, type, radio frequency, codes, and features are indicated * Each VOR also includes a circular compass rose Airport Traffic and Airspace Information * Class B, C, D, E airspace is designated by colored lines of various types * Elevations of floor or ceiling of some types of airspace are also indicated * Location, name, and direction of Federal Airways are shown * Special use airspace is shown using specific colors and markings * Military Training Routes * Terminal Radar Service areas * National Security Areas * Mode C areas Obstructions Tall towers are especially dangerous and have specific markings according to their height above ground and whether or not lighted. * Up to 1,000 feet above ground, a small, inverted \\"V\\" with a dot * Towers 1,000 feet and over: the \\"V\\" is elongated. * Groups of towers are shown with multiple symbols * Towers with high-intensity lights are indicated by \\"lightning bolts\\" around the tip of the symbol. * The elevation of the top of the obstacle is shown feet and depicted in both height above mean sea level and height above ground in parentheses. Topographic Information Based upon standard mapping symbols, these markings usually designate man-made structures that may be identifiable from the air, including: * Major roadways, with or without showing route numbers (solid lines) * Railroads, bridges, viaducts, dams (black lines, railroads with cross-hatching) * Power transmission lines (may also be an obstacle in some areas) (solid lines between tower symbols) * Aerial cables (dashed line between black boxes) * Outdoor facilities such as stadiums, schools, golf courses, etc. (black box) * Outdoor theaters, race tracks (funnel shape, oval shape) * Water tank (black dot), lookout towers (circle with triangle inside), oil wells (empty circle), water wells (blue dot) * Coast guard stations (diamond with \\"CG\\") Where relevant, a mountain pass and its elevation may be shown with curved lines. Miscellaneous Some indicators do not cleanly fall into the previous categories. These include: * Isogonic lines, dashed magenta lines, indicating magnetic variation for a given year; * Indications of flashing lights (star with Fl) or marine lights (black dot); * Local operations such as parachuting, glider, and ultralight (magenta parachute or glider symbol with letter G, H (hang glider), U (ultralight)); * Preferred reporting points (magenta flag with name), on easily identified features; and * VFR waypoints that are listed in the pertinent Airport/Facility Directory.

He sited them on the Esquiline Hill, atop the agger of the Servian Wall and its adjoining necropolis, near the gardens of Lamia. Site Topographers disagree about whether the gardens lay on both sides of the Servian Wall and both north and south of the porta Esquilina. Many of the burial pits of the ancient necropolis, attested to predate the gardens, have been found near the north-west corner of the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele, that is, outside the porta Esquilina and the Servian Wall and north of the via Tiburtina vetus. Probably, the horti extended north from that gate and road, on both sides of the agger.HJ 345‚Äë7; BC 1874, 166‚Äë171; Richter, 313; LR 411‚Äë413; Cons. 155 ff. for works of art found here. Facilities The Latin all-encompassing term for gardens, horti, is an effective misnomer, as in antiquity it referred generally to luxury villas on the outskirts of Rome, so- named for especially prominent vegetation and urban removal. The rustic yet holistic complex seems to have featured libraries, pavilions, riding grounds, baths, and an aviary. Each part of the gardens was visually and physically accessible by successive terraces and porticos. The Aqua Marcia, an essential aqueduct for the city, delivered high-quality water directly past Maecenas's property on the Esquiline, making the grounds uniquely poised to be maintained as one of the first private, landmark Roman gardens. This was crucial to another purported logistical feat of the gardens; Maecenas is said to be the first Roman to build a hot water swimming pool.Cassius Dio LV.7.6 A significant statuary collection has been excavated in the garden's vicinity, raising the probability of an outdoor art gallery. Several marble fountains, pointedly mirroring the unparalleled gardens around them, blur the line between the tamed cultivation and human imitation of nature. These animal likenesses include the horn-shaped rhyton now displayed in the Capitoline Museums. Maecenas's sponsored retinue of influential Latin poets recorded some direct observations of his Esquiline gardens. Propertius mentions that Maecenas ‚Äúpreferred a shady oak and falling waters and a few reliable acres of fruitful soil.\\" In his ode to Maecenas, his close associate Horace emphasizes the sweeping elevation of the garden estate over the expanse of Rome, ultimately symbolic of his friend's detached yet esteemed semi-retirement, spent closely advising Augustus. The so-called Auditorium of Maecenas Closed exterior of the Auditorium of Maecenas, Esquiline The Late Republican- era room preserved on the grounds of the horti, termed the \\"auditorium of Maecenas\\" in modernity, was likely a triclinium, functioning as a private banqueting hall attached to residential quarters. The long, rectangular hall terminated with seven monumentalized, marble-clad steps in a semicircular apse. Drill-holes, accommodative of pipes, could indicate this to be the cascade fixture of a fountain. The inside of the room was doubly secluded, with an ancient ramp leading visitors to a subterranean level. In all cases pertaining to sustained gathering and entertainment, this evidence fractures identification hypotheses between an elite ekklesiasterion-like recitation hall, a votively-equipped nymphaeum, or a sumptuously decorated triclinium. The latter two purposes were not mutually exclusive, but often seasonally convertible. Couches would have been placed in the middle of the room, perhaps facing a performance on the transept end. Evidence as to the social and chronological context of the building includes an erotic epigram by the Greek poet Callimachus, painted onto the interior wall, which entreats a male lover to forgive misbehavior caused by lust and wine. A visually prominent Hellenistic precedent reinforced the individualistic emotionalism and witty experimentation valued by Augustan neoteric and elegiac writers, who would have frequented the weighty functions of Maecenas, a renowned cultivator of culture. In fact, a Latin adaptation of the same poem appears in the works of Propertius, who certainly spent significant time on the estate. Interior of auditorium The structure was built directly into the Servian Wall, as the city had long outgrown the defensive fortifications. Verse of Horace attests to the domestic architectural takeover of the Servian Wall in Esquiline garden estates, as when he writes of a \\"stroll on the sunny rampart.\\" The interior wall sports seventeen niches, five along the apse and six on either side, decorated with naturalistic frescos depicting landscapes and gardens. However, their correlation to the Pompeian Third Style of Roman painting makes this decoration a likely product of later renovations done by Tiberius. Painting motifs evocative of the Dionysian Mysteries, such as drunken processional scenes with thyrsi and maenads prominent, match the early imperial fascination with cult initiation rites. Detail of apse The wall enclosing the southeastern side is a post-excavation addition. In its ancient form, the room seems to have been theatrically opened to the city below. Panoramic exposure to both the Alban Hills and the surrounding neighborhoods ensured that occupants could view all while themselves being seen. History Prior to its transformation by Maecenas, this area of the Esquiline was a graveyard for the poor. Horace, Satires, I.8 It was cleared of this purpose in 38 BC, when the Roman Senate banned open-air corpse cremation within a two-mile radius of the city. Cassius Dio 48.43.3 The original phase of the garden was constructed by the conclusion of the 30s BC. The use of opus reticulatum brickwork is the basis for this dating. Augustus preferred to stay in the gardens of his friend whenever he became ill. Suetonius, Divus Augustus 72.2 When Maecenas died in 8 BC, he left the gardens to Augustus in his will, and they became imperial property thereafter. Tiberius lived there after his return to Rome in 2 AD.Suetonius, Tiberius 15 Nero connected them with the Palatine Hill via his Domus Transitoria,Tac. Ann. XV.39 and was alleged to view the burning of that palatial house from the turris MaecenatianaSuet. Nero 38 This turris might be the molem propinquam nubibus arduis (\\"the pile, among the clouds\\") mentioned by Horace.Horace, Odes, iii.29.10. Towards the end of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, Seneca the Younger contended with the legacy of Maecenas through the lens of decadence-despising Stoic philosophy. He said the gardens' immersive blend of art, nature, and water allowed that Maecenas \\"diverted his worried mind with the sound of rippling waters.\\" Sen., Prov. 1.3.10 This negative reception of the gardens as a weak hermit's retreat is rooted in an indictment of the overarching effeminacy, illiberalism, and intoxication of the class and time which they symbolized. Sensory manipulation and distraction, on the scale of the garden or Maecenas' patronage within, spelled a loss of control incompatible with proper patriarchal goals. The imperial tutor and consul Marcus Cornelius Fronto purchased the gardens by the mid-2nd century AD. In addition to his surviving correspondence with Marcus Aurelius, which boasts of a special connection to Horace forged by owning the land of Maecenas,Fronto, ad M. Caesarem 2.2 - \\"Plane multum mihi facetiarum contulit istic Horatius Flaccus, memorabilis poeta mihique propter Maecenatem ac Maecenatianos hortos meos non alienus. Is namque Horatius Sermonum libr(o) s(ecundo) fabulam istam Polemonis inseruit, si recte memini, hisce versibus...\\" nine lead water-pipes inscribed with his name were found adjacent to the so-called auditorium. A domus Frontoniana, mentioned during the twelfth century in the topographical guide to Rome by Magister Gregorius, also may refer to these gardens.Journal of Roman Studies, 53.1 (1919:35) The auditorium and the associated finds of the garden were unearthed and excavated throughout the 1870s, during the feverish post-unification development of Rome into an urban capital city. Consequently, some adjoining remains were minimally described and quickly destroyed.

The investigation into the death, \\"unique in British crime history\\", revealed expert-level tampering with both canopies, but failed to determine whether the incident was murder or suicide. Background Stephen Paul Hilder was born on 12 December 1982 in Hereford and attended the Bishop of Hereford's Bluecoat School. He was later an officer cadet at the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom in Shrivenham, Wiltshire, England. A keen parachutist, he died around 2:45 pm on Friday, 4 July 2003, at Hibaldstow Airfield, when both his main and reserve parachutes failed to operate correctly. He had been participating in a week-long British Collegiate Parachute Association championship skydiving competition with his \\"Black Rain\\" teammates and fellow officer cadets, Adrian Blair and David Mason (both aged 19), who had all made over 200 jumps each. The unusual death quickly generated massive nationwide media interest. The reports of sabotage also had noticeable effects on the subsequent behaviour of parachutists at championship events in the UK, and resulted in an increase in the sales of secure bags and lockers for the storage of equipment. His funeral was held at St Mary's Church in Burghill, Herefordshire, on Thursday, 31 July 2003.  Criminal investigation  Initially, due to cloudy conditions, the incident was not noticed as it happened, either by the team's videographer, his teammates, or observers on the ground. However, a disturbance in a nearby cornfield, where jumpers who missed the landing zone often ended up, was noticed, and the body was soon found. The Humberside Police were called and collected evidence from the body, alongside DNA samples from everyone present and visually inspecting all other parachutes on-site. They initially reported that his parachute had been sabotaged, with the risers (fabric connectors between the harness and lines) for his reserve parachute having been deliberately cut with a hook knife. A 10-month search for a murderer with a motive ensued, including nationwide mail-outs to all BPA members, a Crimewatch programme, and a full-page advertisement in the BPA magazine, Skydive Blair and Mason were arrested in October 2003 and later released without charge, while a third man, who remained unnamed, was also arrested and subsequently released without charge. Laboratory tests of the parachute straps revealed that fibres from the severed risers were present on Hilder's body, while DNA tests on the parachute straps revealed the presence of Hilder's DNA alone. The police concluded that Hilder had cut his own straps. This caused bafflement for both the police and Hilder's family and friends, who had seen no indication that Hilder was intending to commit suicide. One police officer stated that \\"Nothing we have discovered during the investigation and no one we have interviewed has said anything to suggest Stephen may have been contemplating killing himself.\\"  Coroner's inquest  In March 2005, a coroner's inquest recorded an open verdict on the cause of Hilder's death. The inquest was also informed that at the time of his death, Hilder had money problems and was around ¬£17,000 in debt (due to overspending related to skydiving), was close to the end of a casual relationship, and had wrongly assumed that he was failing his first-year academy exams. Other possibly related factors raised included his relatively recent conversion to Catholicism and his interest in a possible transfer to the navy. On 25 March 2005, North Lincolnshire coroner Stewart Atkinson refused to accept that the death was a suicide after a forensic scientist testified that the lack of DNA could be attributable to a saboteur wearing gloves and that crucially, the presence of fibres from the severed risers on Hilder's body was of no evidential value, as transfer could have taken place in freefall or when the risers were subsequently removed in the field where Hilder landed. The forensic scientist was therefore unable to support any positive assertion that Hilder had been responsible for making the cuts. While a test on scissors found in the locked boot of Hilder's car demonstrated that they were the implement used to make the cuts, there was no further evidence of where the act had taken place or who may have used the scissors in question (given that the car keys had been left in the ignition). Atkinson also stated that there was no proof that someone else was responsible for cutting the risers.  Similar incidents  One of the few leads that the police had when searching for a saboteur was an old issue of an American skydiving magazine, found at the drop zone, that reported one of the four other recorded cases of sabotaged parachutes in the history of skydiving. One well-known case was that of Cary Hopwood, an American skydiver who had survived a parachute failure in 1996 after borrowing one from a friend, world champion skydiver, Kirk Verner. A similar tampering event happened to Charlie Mullins in 1997, but the interference was noticed in a pre-jump check. In October 2010, a 26-year-old Belgian elementary school teacher, Els Clottemans, was convicted of murder and sentenced to 30 years in jail for tampering with a love-triangle rival's parachute in exactly the same way as Hilder's. The victim, Els Van Doren, died in November 2006 in the town of Opglabbeek when both her parachutes failed. In May 2015, at Netheravon Airfield, Hilder's regular dropzone, army Sgt. Emile Cilliers was arrested after being suspected of tampering with his wife Victoria's parachute. On 5 May, both his wife's parachutes had failed to operate correctly, but the reserve inflated enough to enable her to survive the 1,200 metres (4,000-foot) fall. In May 2018, he was found guilty of attempted murder in an attempt to receive a ¬£120,000 life-insurance payment and to end his marriage to be with his lover.  Media  The incident was covered by the BBC's Crimewatch in an episode aired on 24 July 2003, and by ITV Studios in a 2011 documentary titled Real Crime: Sky Diver Murder or Suicide? It was also covered by a July 2018 episode of Casefile True Crime Podcast.

Nardulli, and Daron R. Shaw. \\"Candidate appearances in presidential elections, 1972-2000.\\" Political Communication 19.1 (2002): 49-72. Etymology The term derives from the early American custom in which candidates campaigned from town to town and stood upon a sawed off tree stump to deliver their speech. U.S. campaigns In presidential campaigns in the United States, a candidate's speech at his or her party's presidential nominating convention usually forms the basis for the stump speech for the duration of the national campaign. Stump speeches are not meant to generate news, outside of local media covering a candidate's appearance. National media usually ignore their contents in their daily news coverage. The predictability of stump speeches gives reporters a general indication that the candidate will soon conclude his speech. An example of this comes from New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, who would constantly use the phrase \\"the brotherhood of man, under the fatherhood of God\\" toward the end of his speeches during his multiple bids for the Republican presidential nomination. Reporters covering Rockefeller came to abbreviate the expression as BOMFOG.

According to the government the Act \\"is intended to represent a major step forward in the Government‚Äôs aim of ensuring that all children in all schools get the education they need to enable them to fulfil their potential\\". Background to the Act  Trust schools white paper  In October 2005, the DfES published the White Paper Higher Standards, Better Schools for All ‚Äî More Choice for Parents and Pupils. It set out plans to \\"radically improve the system\\". The blurb distributed with it established a number of key areas that the White Paper was intended to address: * The challenge to reform * A school system shaped by parents * Choice and access for all * Personalised learning * Parents driving improvement * Supporting children and parents * School discipline * The school workforce and school leadership * A new role for local authorities Trust schools One of the most controversial elements in the White Paper was the proposal to establish a new breed of school called a Trust school. The White Paper introduced a new term to the educational taxonomy when it explained how schools would \\"acquire a Trust\\". It was noted that there was a remarkable similarity between Trust schools and voluntary aided schools/Foundation schools. The proposals allowed for each Trust school to decide its own governance model from either the VA or Foundation model. Local authority assets - buildings and land - would be transferred to trust ownership, and the trust would take on the responsibility for the employment of all the school staff. The governance model of VA Schools would allow the Trust to directly appoint more than half of the governors allowing it to effectively control the governing body. Such a model would also reduce the number of elected Parent governors. To tackle this obvious reduction in parent power it was proposed that a new consultative body - a Parents‚Äô Council to ensure that parents have a strong voice in decisions about the way the school is run - although it was stressed that statutory guidance on this would be produced at some yet unspecified later stage. This notion effectively killed any suggestion that Kelly could be seen as a champion of parents. The Trusts were intended to be non-profit making and to have charitable status, although they could be formed by commercial enterprises. In fact one of the early DfES-hosted seminars on the establishment of Trusts included representatives from Microsoft and KPMG. But it was their ability to set their own admission arrangements that generated the most criticism. Political fallout The white paper was not received with universal acclaim. A large number of Labour backbenchers, as well as numerous Labour luminaries like Neil Kinnock and former Education Secretary Estelle Morris, made known their opposition to the proposals and published an alternative white paper. Faced with such a rebellion, the government initially stressed that it would press on with the reforms. Tory leader David Cameron then announced that these reforms were in line with Tory policies and that he would support the bill if presented in the proposed form. The government were faced with the prospect of pushing through their reforms only with opposition support and in the face of increased resistance from its own supporters. Following a report by the Education Select Committee - which was in itself controversial - Ruth Kelly finally wrote to the committee chairman Barry Sheerman in February 2006, outlining how the bill would look when presented to parliament and stressing how it would accommodate many of the fears expressed in the committee's report. This was reported as the government backtracking on many key issues although it stressed that it was not a climbdown. The Education and Inspections Bill 2006 On 28 February 2006, the bill was finally published. It contained much of what had been trailed, although most notable by its absence was any mention of \\"Trust school\\". In reality, Foundation and Voluntary Aided schools will pick up the mantle of \\"Trust school\\". The Act is designed to give greater freedoms to schools, including the possibility of: *Owning their own assets *Employing their own staff *Setting their own admissions arrangements Other important provisions include: *Creation of a Local Authority duty to promote fair access to educational opportunities *Giving schools staff a clear statutory right to discipline students *By law, all state (not private) schools must have a behaviour policy in place that includes measures to prevent all forms of bullying among pupils.

A major tributary of the city's principal waterway, Buffalo Bayou, White Oak originates near the intersection of Texas State Highway 6 and U.S. Highway 290 (the Northwest Freeway) and meanders southeast for until it joins Buffalo Bayou in Downtown. The river serves as a greenway which connects Downtown to the Houston Heights, Oak Forest, Garden Oaks, and Inwood Forest. A large majority of White Oak Bayou's route travels through highly developed areas. The river's watershed contains a population of over 430,000.  Watershed  White Oak Bayou drains areas throughout the northwest portions of Harris County as well as the City of Jersey Village and portions of the City of Houston. Its watershed covers and includes three primary streams: White Oak Bayou, Little White Oak Bayou and Cole Creek. In addition, Vogel Creek and Brickhouse Gully are among the major tributaries in the watershed. In all, there are about of open streams in the White Oak Bayou watershed, including the primary and tributary channels. Wildlife habitat exists on much of the undeveloped tracts scattered throughout the watershed and has been preserved and/or created in several of the large regional stormwater detention basins constructed by the Harris County Flood Control. However, only a little undisturbed wildlife habitat exists along the urban channels of White Oak Bayou and its tributaries. History Postcard of Bayou (circa 1907) The original Port of Houston was located at the confluence of White Oak Bayou and Buffalo Bayou in what is now downtown Houston by the . This area is called \\"Allen's Landing\\" and is the official birthplace of Houston, Texas. The landing is now designated as a historical city park. White Oak and Buffalo Bayous at Main St. after Tropical Storm Allison, June 2001 Near a bend in White Oak Bayou, where Houston's First and Sixth wards meet, lies Olivewood Cemetery, the historic resting place for many freed slaves and some of Houston‚Äôs earliest black residents. Established in 1877, it is the oldest graveyard for African-Americans in the Houston area. In early June 2001, the Bayou caused at least three of 17 Houston-area deaths attributed to Tropical Storm Allison, when it raged out of its banks, as the maximum rainfall from Allison that fell on June 8 and 9 was shifted primarily over the White Oak Bayou watershed. Its tributary, Little White Oak Bayou, accounted for another two deaths. Parkland and trails The West White Oak Bayou Trail runs along the banks of the bayou, parallel to T. C. Jester Boulevard, from 11th Street to Antoine St, providing bicyclists and pedestrians a long mostly concrete and asphalt trail (the portion just South of Little York to Antoine has been repaved and extended, and White Oak Bayou Village trail head sits on this portion of the trail. Passing through several parks, the trail is lighted and includes protective railings in some areas. In 2006, the Houston Press named the West White Oak Bayou Trail the best bike path in the City of Houston. This former Missouri‚ÄìKansas‚ÄìTexas Railroad bridge over the White Oak Bayou in Houston is now part of the Heights Bike Trail Connections to and from the West White Oak Bayou Trail include the Central Business District (CBD) Access On-street Bikeway, at 11th Street and at Ella Boulevard on the south; and the West Houston On-street Bikeway, at 34th Street, Du Barry Lane (to Wakefield Drive), 43rd Street, Carleen Road (to Bethlehem Street), and Pinemont Drive on the north. Just north of downtown Houston, around White Oak Park, the banks of White Oak Bayou have been cleaned and a swampy area restored where birdwatching can be enjoyed. Yellow-crowned night heron and green heron nest there, and a number of eastern woodland birds also reside in and around the park. In addition, the White Oak Bayou Association, a non- profit organization dedicated to the preservation, restoration, and maintenance of wildlife habitats along the bayou, has been established as part of the Citizens' Environmental Coalition. Also along the bayou, between 18th and 11th Streets, is a grove of trees that have been planted by Trees For Houston. The \\"Tribute Grove\\" offers individuals the opportunity to commemorate special people or events by planting a tree on White Oak's banks. Since 1997, 1,494 trees have been planted in area Tribute Groves by Trees For Houston.

The band has performed across the United States and Canada including appearances at Bonnaroo, SxSW, Wakarusa and Langerado. Brothers Past has been featured in Relix and their self-released albums have been reviewed in Urb Magazine, The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia Daily News and The Village Voice. History The band was formed in 1998 by Tom Hamilton (vocals, guitar), Tom McKee (keyboards, vocals), Clay Parnell (aka \\"Parnstar,\\"bass, vocals), and Rick Lowenberg (drums). Hamilton and McKee have worked together since May 1998. After moving into a house together outside of West Chester, PA, the four musicians began writing material influenced by various elements of electronica (drum and bass, jungle, dub and house music.) The band began a Thursday night residency at Rex's in West Chester, PA, where it performed weekly for almost two years, manned by Sean ford on the sound, building a small but dedicated following of fans. Not long after, the band began touring the East Coast and performing at regional festivals. Since then, Brothers Past toured nationally across the United States, playing more than 800 shows since their 2000 formation, including appearances at Wakarusa, Bonnaroo and SXSW. The band has released three albums and an EP. In the middle of 2006, it was announced that Lowenberg would be leaving the band to pursue environmental law and that Ilya Stemkovsky, formerly of OM Trio would take over for him. Stemkovsky performed with the band until Dec. 31, 2007, when the band announced a hiatus to focus on other interests.

McKee began teaching piano at the School of Rock in Downingtown, PA where he currently works as the school's Music Director. After a one-year hiatus, the band returned to the stage (with original drummer Rick Lowenberg) at a New Year's Eve performance on December 31, 2008 at The Note in West Chester, Pennsylvania. The show sold out in less than 30 minutes. In October 2010, Brothers Past celebrated its 10-year anniversary and marked the occasion with the announcement of a digital box set release entitled Everything Must Go. On the 10th of every month, a new studio track and a previously unreleased soundboard recording of a special show from the band's ten-year history is released via the band's website. In 2012 Brothers Past self-released their 3rd studio album entitled \\"Everything Must Go 0111.\\" Brothers Past has since taken another hiatus after playing their last show on 08/23/2014 at Camp Barefoot. There was no mention of the hiatus or official address from the band, but their website has since gone out of service. All members are currently working on their own projects.

He distinguished himself flying scout- bombers from the carrier USS Yorktown during the battles of Coral Sea and Midway, earning a Navy Cross and gold star for his contributions. Dickson was promoted to Lieutenant Commander and given command of Bombing Eighteen, a newly formed squadron still training stateside. Dickson, however, died in a flying accident while still stationed in California. Pre-War Dickson was born on September 16, 1914 in Columbus, Ohio. His parents were Francis E. Dickson and Mildred Rockey Dickson. In 1936, Dickson graduated from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. The paragraph dedicated to him in the graduating year's Lucky Bag reads: \\"After spending his early years roaming the world, Dick finally decided to follow the profession of his forefathers, that of a seafaring fighter. Dick's battles with the academics has placed him among the intelligentsia of the upper ten-percent. His academic efforts have never been of prime importance, however; his chief interests have been getting enough sleep, fresh air, exercise, and the girl of his dreams. Dick has a deep-seated hatred of all that is artificial or unjust. His spirit rebels against oppression or unfairness in any form; give him a free hand, and the world will be a Utopia within a week. A sunny disposition and a willingness to do a favor or forget a grievance make Dixie an admirable companion and real friend.\\" World War II Harlan R. Dickson was promoted to the rank of lieutenant on 2 January 1942 and assigned to Bombing Squadron 5 (VB-5), attached to USS Yorktown (CV-5). He participated in the raid on a Japanese landing force in Tulagi in the Solomon Islands on 4 May 1942. Shortly thereafter, Dickson took an active role in attacking Japanese carriers on 7 and 8 May. For his tenacity in the face of considerable enemy AA and fighter protection, and for significant damaged dealt to Japanese warships, Dickson was awarded his first Navy Cross. Despite damaged inflicted upon Yorktown during the Battle of Coral Sea, she was patched up enough to join the battle group in defense of Midway Atoll. With three Japanese flattops crippled on 4 June, search aircraft from Scouting Squadron 5 (re-designated VS-5 after Coral Sea) attempted to locate the final remaining carrier, Hiry≈´. Lt. Dickson flew wing for Lt. Samuel Adams and the pair spotted a task group consisting of the missing carrier, two battleships, four cruisers, and four destroyers. Despite being forced to fend off an attacking A6M Zeke in their slow Douglas SBDs, Lt. Adams radioed an incredibly accurate report on the Japanese whereabouts and aircraft from USS Enterprise razed the Hiry≈´. The damage was so severe she was ordered abandoned and eventually scuttled by destroyers. For his actions at the Battle of Midway, Lt. Dickson was awarded a gold star in lieu of a second Navy Cross. However, Yorktown did not survive long past the battle and Dickson would have to return to the States. Bombing Squadron Eighteen Having been promoted to Lieutenant Commander, Harlan Dickson was given command Bombing Eighteen (VB-18). The squadron had been commissioned on 20 July 1943 with Lieutenant Commander Charles C. Gold as commander. On 27 November, Dickson took charge of squadron (Gold having been promoted and assigned elsewhere) and was tasked with continuing its training. His training schedule was relentless. Dickson stressed the importance of instrument flying, often having his crews fly training operations at night or in adverse weather conditions. To facilitate the rapid improvement of the amateur flyers, Dickson had requested two of his old squadron mates, Lts. Leif Larsen and Benjamin Preston transferred to VB-18. Both men were decorated for actions earlier in the war and would prove to be valuable role models for the other men, as well as continuing to operate as effective combat pilots in their own right. Death Naval Air Station Alameda requested VB-18 take part in a Marine practice landing assault in San Luis Obispo County and Lt. Comm. Dickson accepted, readily. On 5 February 1944, he led a section of bombers simulating an attack on a blockhouse using practice bombs filled with sand. The formation approached the target from 15,000 ft. Standard practice had been to make a near-vertical dive from this altitude, releasing the payload at 3,000 ft., providing the aircraft with enough clearance to level off and disengage. However, all previous exercises had been at or near sea-level and the blockhouse was situated on a hill that was 1,700 ft. above sea-level. Lt. Comm. Dickson led the formation in the dive and released his practice bomb, however; having not compensated for the target's location, struggled to avoid collision with the deck. The abrupt pullout caused his plane to experience a high-speed stall and roll over. At such an extreme low-altitude it was impossible to recover from and Harlan Dickson's aircraft slammed into the ground. He died instantly. Recognition Harlan Rockey Dickson was interred at Arlington National Cemetery. On 17 December 1944, the Sumner-class destroyer USS Harlan R Dickson (DD-708) was launched in a ceremony attended by his mother, Mrs. Mildred Mae Studler. It was commissioned into the United States Navy on 17 February of the same year and served for twenty-seven years before it was stricken from the Navy record.

This bunchgrass is often used as an ornamental grass. It is native to Europe but can be found elsewhere as an introduced species. It is found especially in prairies, at the side of roads and in uncultivated fields. The bulbous subspecies can be a weed of arable land. It is palatable grass for livestock and is used both as forage (pasture) and fodder (hay and silage). Description This coarse grass can grow to tall. The leaves are bright green, broad, slightly hairy, and rough. The ligule is long and smooth edged. The panicle is up to , and the bunched spikelets have projecting and angled awns up to long, green or purplish. The panicles often remain into winter.BSBI Description retrieved 10 December 2010. The spikelets are oblong or gaping. It flowers from June to September. The roots are yellow.Grasses by C E Hubbard, 1978, published by Penguin books Two subspecies have been described: * Arrhenatherum elatius subsp. elatius, the more common variety. * Arrhenatherum elatius subsp. bulbosum (also called Arrhenatherum tuberosum), onion couch or tuber oat-grass, distinguished by the presence of corms at the base of the stem, by which it propagates. It occurs in vegetated shingle and arable land. Habitat Arrhenatherum elatius is a principal species in two UK National Vegetation Classification habitat communities: the very widespread MG1 (Arrhenatherum elatius grassland) and the much rarer MG2 (Arrhenatherum elatius - Filipendula ulmaria tall-herb grassland). This means that it can be found with species such as Dactylis glomerata (also known as cock's-foot and orchard grass), and Filipendula ulmaria (also known as meadow-sweet). It is found on road verges, along hedges and riverbanks. It can colonise and stabilise limestone scree, bare calcareous cliffs, maritime shingle and coastal dunes.

The film was co-produced by Quine and Day's husband at the time, Martin Melcher. The film was re-released in 1961, with the title Twinkle and Shine.It Happened To Jane Turner Classic Movies. Accessed September 20, 2014 Plot In May 1959, in the town of Cape Anne, Maine, a foul-up by the Eastern & Portland Railroad (E&P;) results in the death of 300 lobsters shipped by Jane Osgood, an attractive, widowed businesswoman with two children. She gets her lawyer and friend, George Denham, to go after the E&P; to pay damages after her customer, the Marshalltown Country Club, refuses all future orders. In the E&P; office in New York City, railroad executive Harry Foster Malone learns about the Osgood lawsuit. Due to the budget cuts Malone had instituted, there had been no station agent at Marshalltown to receive Jane's lobsters. Malone sends employees Crawford Sloan and Selwyn Harris to Cape Anne to deal with the situation. The two attorneys offer Jane $700 in compensation, but Jane turns it down because the loss to her business reputation is more than that. Jane wins in court, but E&P; appeals the case to the state Supreme Court in Augusta, Maine. George files a writ of execution to force payment and take possession of the train, Old 97, in lieu of payment. Jane is interviewed by local newspaper reporter Matilda Runyon, who then calls the Daily Mirror in New York. Top reporter Larry Hall is sent to Cape Anne for the story. Television stations also want to interview Jane. Malone retaliates by charging Jane rent for the siding on which the train is sitting. In a charming scene, Jane and George are shown singing an original song, \\"Be Prepared\\", to a pack of local cub scouts at a forested picnic. Jane travels to New York to appear on ABC, NBC, and CBS, including the show I've Got a Secret. Fearful of bad publicity, Malone finally gives in and cancels the rent, but gives Jane the train. Meanwhile, George becomes increasingly jealous when he learns that Larry in New York is attracted to Jane and has proposed marriage to her. Jane receives telegrams of support from the American public, and the Marshalltown club, which had earlier reneged, now promises to continue business with her. Back in Cape Anne, during a packed town meeting, Jane learns that Malone has ordered all his trains to bypass the town and has also given Jane 48 hours to remove Old 97 from the track. With service ended, local merchants will find it difficult to get their merchandise. Jane runs away and George, in an impassioned speech, scolds the townspeople for turning against her. Realizing that Old 97 is just the way to deliver the lobsters, Jane and George persuade everybody to fill up the train's tender with coal from their homes. George recruits his uncle Otis, a retired E&P; engineer, to engineer the train. Old 97 sets off with Jane, her children, and George (who shovels coal to the engine), to deliver lobsters on board to customers in several distant towns. Malone does everything possible to delay them, even as several of his office staff resign, seeing him as a villain. Jane becomes upset at the roundabout route Malone is forcing them to take. Eventually, the coal runs out, stopping Old 97 and blocking traffic. Just then, Malone arrives by helicopter, after hearing that the train is stalled. Jane scolds him for his underhanded actions. He had won, but found victory bittersweet. Malone finally agrees to Jane's demands. Jane and George tell him to come along so he cannot cause any more trouble. He finally shows his good side by helping shovel coal. Larry and a photographer are in Marshall Town when the train arrives. George kisses Jane in front of Larry, and she agrees to marry George and remain in Cape Anne. After the wedding, as George is being sworn in as the new first selectman, a badly needed fire engine pulls into town, a present from Malone. Cast Production Old 97 is based on the J-Class 2-8-2 steam locomotives that used to run on the New Haven Railroad. Old 97 was a common nickname for steam locomotives that had the number 97 on them (see, for example, the popular song ‚ÄúThe Wreck of the Old 97‚Äù). The movie was mostly filmed in Chester, Connecticut. Some scenes were filmed in Southington, Connecticut, Plainville, Connecticut, and Plainfield, Connecticut. The final scene filmed at downtown Chester Connecticut was about 1 mile from the train station used in the movie. The locomotive in the final scene was a wooden prop built near where the final scene was filmed. People from all over Connecticut were invited to be extras in the movie. The producers had difficulty deciding on the film's title. It was initially called Miss Casey Jones and then That Jane from Maine. The film was re-released in 1961 with another title Twinkle and Shine.

Notable products were Movie cameras, 126 and 110 cameras with built-in electronic flash (the \\"Everflash\\" series). In the 1930s, the firm built low cost 16mm cameras that are still in use today. The firm considered that labeling its products as Made in USA was an important part of its appeal. The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in January 1991. One popular version of their movie camera line was the Capri K27, with 3 lenses and 9 settings for cloudy to sunny day conditions. This was a light, easy to use movie camera, and is considered a rare collectable today. The firm was originally located in Boston, MA and moved to Clifton, NJ when purchased by Berkey Photo in 1968. In 1970 they began to manufacture the Everflash series of cameras in Clifton that accepted Kodak's new 126 cartridge film, and several years later Everflash cameras that handled the then new Kodak 110 cartridge film. Keystone's claim to fame was their built in electronic flash rather than having to use a flash bulb or flash cube, which was popular then on many other cameras. Poor internal management structure led to many quality problems in the early 1970s and serious losses. Keystone later added its instant picture Everflash camera using Polaroid film again stressing the Everflash feature rather than Polaroid's use of the Flash Bar. From 1970 to 1977, Berkey accounted for 8.2% Of the sales in the camera market in the United States, reaching a peak of 10.2% In 1976. In 1978, Berkey sold its camera division and thus abandoned this market.

It's led by president Merrill Bergs. The trademark of Tara Labs is their use of solid wire.  History  The company was established in 1984, when company founder Matthew Bond, trained in physics and electronics theory, was looking for ways to improve the performance of audio components and the wire used within an audio system. As early as the mid 1970s and early 1980s, Matthew Bond had experimented with solid core conductors of different diameters. He hypothesized that an 'optimum diameter' of 18 AWG (American Wire Gage) or 1 millimeter was ideal for audio frequencies because there was minimal high frequency attenuation caused by the principles known as skin effect.http://www.theabsolutesound.com/articles/cable-and-interconnect- construction/?page=3 Matthew Bond's work was corroborated by research work from the NBS or National Bureau of Standards in the 1930s and confirmed later by Stereophile Magazine in July 1988 in a table presented as the DC to AC resistance ratio versus frequency, in wires of different diameters.Stereophile Magazine, July 1988, p.106 Matthew Bond is credited with the invention of solid-core wires for audio use, because his work predates Dennis Morecroft (1984) and any of the early solid-core wires developed for use in audio in England at the time. The first commercial speaker cables were designed in 1984, the Phase II speaker cable, a solid core design. Thirty years later, the Phase II Speaker Cable is still available through retailers in the United States. In 1990, TARA Labs introduced the world‚Äôs first cable to have a floating conductor unterminated at one end that would allow for an increased high-frequency bandwidth to be coupled to the signal carrying conductors (US patent No. 5033091). Later, a control device inside a box fitted to the cable (The Temporal Continuum) allowed the user to adjust the amount of high frequency energy to be heard. TARA Labs introduced Rectangular Solid Core cables in 1992. The cables employed solid core conductors with a rectangular cross section. Rectangular Solid Core can be made in specific proportions(width and height), and this provides for the tuning of the frequency response of a conductor as compared to a round conductor of the same size or DC resistance.http://www.sonic.net/~marcs/products/rsc.html The cables employed solid core conductors with a rectangular cross section.http://www.taralabs.com/ Both the Gen2 conductor and the smaller Gen3 conductor are said to be Eight-Nines‚Ñ¢ pure copper, which is 99.999999% pure. TARA Labs‚Äô trademarks for this technology are 8N‚Ñ¢ and SA-OF8N¬Æ (Super Annealed ‚Äì Oxygen Free 8 Nines copper). According to Bond, the term ‚Äòannealing‚Äô refers to the method whereby a conductor can be made softer and more conductive. In 1999 Tara Labs introduced the \\"Zero\\" interconnect with a Vacuum Dielectric Insulation system.http://www.taralabs.com/glossaryhttp://www.theabsolutesound.com/articles/tara- labs-the-zero-interconnect-and-omega-speaker-cable/ In 2014, TARA Labs introduced a new line of high-end cables called The Evolution Series.

Generally, Rory writes the melodies, and Calum the lyrics. After former lead singer Donnie Munro left the band in 1997, Rory took lead vocal duties on songs in the band's catalogue written in the Scottish Gaelic language, as the band's new lead singer, Bruce Guthro, was not a Gaelic speaker. In the mid to the late 1960s, Macdonald was a part of a band called The Skyvers. Macdonald previously attended the Glasgow School of Art and had a promising career as a graphic designer until Runrig went 'professional'. Later putting these skills into practice, he designed the sleeve notes for Runrig's Recovery and Heartland albums. Early life Macdonald was born in Dornoch, Sutherland. His father, Donald John MacDonald of North Uist, Outer Hebrides, was a World War II veteran. The family moved to North Uist, when Rory was about four years old. On arrival in Lochmaddy, his younger brother Calum was born. During the Second World War, Macdonald's father, Donald, and his unit were ambushed in Normandy. He witnessed the death of his best friend, Sandy MacIntyre. After this, Donald used to visit Sandy's family. On one such occasion, when Rory was eight, he was taken along to Sandy's old home. There, Sandy's parents gave him his old accordion. Back home, he began practising, playing at school concerts. On this accordion he wrote his first ever tune: a Scottish dance march called \\"Sandy MacIntyre\\". This experience partly inspired the 1985 song \\"The Everlasting Gun\\", featured on the Heartland album, along with news of the Falklands War.

Conduct Individual conduct is seen as impacting their entire family, social group, and community; therefore everyone is expected to be respectful, dignified, and observant in public settings and in most aspects of life. Greetings When greeting people in a home, it is considered improper if the guest ignores anyone present. Guests are expected to acknowledge and greet every person at a social occasion, including children and babies. When shaking hands, it is appropriate for the guest to first greet the person on their right-hand side, and then work their way left. This ensures that the guest's palm makes contact with the palm of the person receiving the handshake - touching the back of the hand instead of the palm is considered insulting or unlucky. Guests are expected to greet the most elderly person present first. The same ritual is expected to be observed upon departure and should be carried out until sufficient familiarity has been established, at which point the ritual becomes redundant. When greeting dignitaries, this procedure is expected to be carried out by all persons present regardless of age or status. Invitations Asking a person to a social event (e.g. a bar or a restaurant) implies that the person offering the invitation will be paying for everything. Inviting people out and then expecting them to pay for themselves is considered extremely rude. When a foreigner is invited to visit a home or community, the guest is expected to bring a gift, commonly a bottle of Schnapps or Kasapreko gin which is available in any shop. Special occasions Naming ceremonies and marriages are marked by family ceremonies. Seasonal festivals serve to bring people together in a spectacular fashion. When attending funerals, weddings, or naming ceremonies; women, including foreign women, must cover their heads with a hat or simple black cloth wound around the head. A man must not have his head covered. Miscellaneous It is unacceptable for women, particularly young foreign women, to wear revealing clothing. Women's clothing that would be acceptable in the West (shorts, low-cut strapped tops, etc.) is not socially acceptable in Ghanaian society. Similarly it is unacceptable for foreign men to be shirtless in public, and unacceptable for Ghanaian men to a lesser degree. Ghanaian social norms are sometimes difficult to establish as younger adults are generally much less inhibited about wearing revealing clothing or being shirtless, while older Ghanaian citizens may find such apparel to be insulting. A general rule is to dress conservatively unless in the company of people of one's own gender or age with whom one is well- acquainted. Drinking alcohol and smoking in public are serious faux pas and should be avoided. Public intoxication to any degree is generally viewed with extreme disapproval. Such activities are perfectly acceptable in a local bar though. When drinking alcohol, it is a common custom to pour the last few drops on the ground as a libation for the gods. People who decline from drinking alcohol may accept an alcoholic drink with gratitude, raise it to their lips without drinking, and then pour it on the ground. Raising the glass to the lips signifies gratitude and pouring the drink away is thus a socially acceptable alternative for those who do not drink. This custom permits non- drinking Ghanaians to join social events without offending those present by refusing a drink. Taking photographs of people unknown to the photographer must be conducted with the same level of consideration as in one's own country. Most Ghanaians are happy to pose for pictures, as it is considered polite.

Overview The flight test engineer generally has overall responsibility for the planning of a specific flight test phase, which includes preparing the test plans in conjunction with other analytical and/or systems engineers, overseeing the buildup of the aircraft to the proper configuration, working with the flight test instrumentation engineer to ensure the sensors and recording systems are installed for required data parameters, and preparing the maneuver-by-maneuver plan for each test flight (enshrined typically in a higher level document called a \\"test plan\\" and then an operational document usually called the \\"test cards\\"). The FTE and the experimental test pilot are jointly responsible for the safety of the test flying. The FTE is also responsible for the overall analysis of the data acquired during a test flight. Finally, the flight test engineer will coordinate with specific analysis and/or systems engineers to write the final flight test report, documenting the results of a specific flight test phase. The FTE may or may not fly on board the test aircraft, depending on the aircraft type or mission objectives. When not in the test aircraft, the FTE normally monitors the test in real-time via data transmitted to a special flight test data center. In this case, the FTE will be in radio contact with the test pilot along with the ground-based team, providing safety of flight monitoring and real-time data analysis. Multiple test aircraft may be required on major aircraft development flight test programs. The test activities of all test aircraft must be coordinated by a senior flight test engineer. On complex test programs, it is also common for each test aircraft to have several FTEs assigned, each with a specific area of responsibility and testing. Often a flight test engineer will be required to come up with techniques for monitoring a specific variable or system, which requires a bespoke piece of equipment to be fabricated. Owing to the specialized nature of the techniques in manufacturing and electronics involved, a flight test engineer is usually highly skilled and will have undergone in-depth training.  Education for flight test engineers  The flight test engineer may have a degree in aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering or cognitive science. A bachelor's degree is generally required, and a master's degree is recommended. Many university aerospace engineering departments offer elective flight test courses for those interested in this field of engineering. The military services have formal training programs for experimental flight test pilots and flight test engineers. These training programs may be attended by selected military or government-employed civilian pilots and engineers. Most military test pilot schools combine pilot and engineers in one class, where they work together just as they would in the real world.

This an elite program of SUPAERO and the FTE graduates get to work on variety of flight test programs at Airbus, Dassault, Safran, Thales, ESA etc. * The National Test Pilot School offers Master of Science degrees in Flight Test Engineering (MSFTE) and Flight Test and Evaluation (MSFT&E;). Upon successful completion of the course of study, students who have an undergraduate degree from an ABET or equivalent university program are eligible to receive the MSFTE degree. Students with other technical backgrounds will be awarded the MSFT&E; degree. While not required, many FTEs are also civilian or military rated pilots. Although FTEs do not actively control the aircraft during tests, this flight background is valuable in understanding flight operations.  Employment of flight test engineers  Flight test engineers are employed by large aviation manufacturers such as: Airbus, Boeing, Safran, Textron Aviation (Bell Helicopter, Cessna and Beechcraft), Bombardier Aerospace, AgustaWestland, BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, Honeywell, Northrop Grumman, Sikorsky Aircraft, Dassault Aviation, A√©rospatiale, Mitsubishi, Piaggio Aero, Embraer, Marshall Aerospace and Defence Group or government research organizations, such as NASA or Qinetiq; or government certification agencies like the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Canada, EASA (Europe), ANAC (Brazil).

The nicknames used for the players are the \\"Maroons\\" or the \\"Saints\\". Qala Saints's main rivals on the island of Gozo are their neighbours' Nadur Youngsters F.C. along with Ghajnsielem F.C.. In the summer of 2010, the club changed its name to Qala Saints F.C.. History The Maroons have never been main contenders for the top honours in Gozo in the past. However, during the last season (2007/2008) the club won two of the major honours offered by Gozitan football ‚Äì the G.F.A Cup and the Super Cup for the first time in the club's history. Other past honours won include the Second Division League on three occasions (1976/77, 1994/95 and 2005/06), and the Second Division Knock/Out Cup on two occasions (2004/05 and 2005/06). The last time that Qala SJ played in the Second Division was during the 2005/06 season, in which they were able to win the Second Division League and Cup double. The Saints won the Second Division League without conceding a single loss during the 2005/06 season. Furthermore, their foreign import, Ishaku Umoru, was joint top scorer in the Second Division League and Joseph Xerri was voted as Best Second Division League Player during this memorable season. During the 2008‚Äì2009 season the Maroons ended the bottom of the First Division and hence were relegated to the Second Division. After a promising start to the season, winning the first knockout competition, Qala were expected to mount a serious challenge for promotion in 2009‚Äì10.

Kao) is a 2006 Thai musical-comedy film. It stars Thai rapper Joey Boy (Apisit Opsasaimlikit) as the leader of a 1970s rock group (Thai string combo) that finds themselves transported by a time machine- microphone to the present day. The band, The Possible, is patterned loosely after an actual Thai band from the 1970s, The Impossibles. The film is directed by Witthaya Thongyooyong, one of the six directors of the hit 2003 Thai film, Fan Chan. Plot In 1969 in Thailand, The Possible are the most popular band. But the fame has caused the band members to have big egos. They ignore their fans. The lead singer, Toi, is cavorting with a farang woman, and is caught by his Thai girlfriend, Straw. One day, on the way to a concert, Toi finds a present that has been given to the band by a fan. It is a pink microphone called a \\"Hit Tester\\". He tries it out at first at another show being given by an upstart rival band, The Impossibles, singing vulgar lyrics as they play one of their hit songs and disrupting the gig. Toi then uses the mic at The Possible's own concert. During the song, there is much confusion, because the eight-piece band's trumpeter is drunk and falls off the riser. As the trombonist and saxophonist step offstage to retrieve their bandmate, there is a flash of light and the remaining five members of the band disappear. They then reappear in what appears to be the same auditorium, only now they are blocking the view of a pornographic film and are booed offstage by the male audience. The band then walks out onto the street and find that Bangkok looks a lot different than it did when the concert started, the most noticeable difference is the skytrain and increased noise pollution and traffic. Slowly, it dawns on them that they have travelled in time 37 years in the future to 2006. The encounter more difficulties when they try to pay for some noodles with their 1969 currency. After fighting with the noodle stall staff, they are thrown in jail. By chance, a middle-aged man (named Ooh) is at the police station paying a traffic ticket when he notices the band. He can't believe his eyes. They look just like his favorite band from his youth. He was their biggest fan. After he gets over his initial shock, he decides to help the band adapt to their new era. The band decides it must play some concerts and try to recreate the energy that caused the time travel. However, their old-style of music no longer attracts crowds, and they don't have their horn section. They try to audition some new horn players, but eventually decide to look up their old members. The trombonist is a Buddhist monk, and the saxophonist is a doddering, gray-haired man. The trumpet player died of alcoholism, leaving his daughter, Nu Malee, an orphan. The band takes pity on the girl and allows her to join. The next hurdle is to get the band a concert. After trying unsuccessfully to land a record deal, they put eventually book a show back at the porn cinema. Much to their dismay, they find that the concert was promoted with the free giveaway of a pirated pornographic VCD and is to be shut down by the police. However, Setha Sirichaya, the lead singer of The Possible's old rivals, The Impossibles (which went on to become the top band in Thailand after The Possible's mysterious disappearance), intervenes and whips up enthusiasm among the crowd of men who wanted to see a pornographic film. With the energy ample, the pink microphone is able to function and transport The Possible back to 1969, where, having seen the error of their ways, the band members reform their personal habits and embark on a career that concentrates on their talents, rather than fame, which will ensure their place as one of the legends of the Thai rock music scene.

Sequence dating is a method of seriation developed by the Egyptologist Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie. By linking styles of pottery with different time periods, he was able to establish the relative chronology of the site.''' Sir Flinders Petrie (1853‚Äì1942) was the first to use seriation in Egyptology. Sir Flinders Petrie, the younger contemporary of archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, was meticulous in his excavations and recorded every artifact and detail on site. From his work, Petrie was able to bring chronological order to 2,200 pit graves of the Naqada cemetery in Upper Egypt. The sequence dating method allowed the relative date, if not the absolute date, of any given Predynastic Egypt site to be ascertained by examining the handles on pottery, general form of the piece, and the stratigraphic layer it was found in. As more evidence of the predynastic period is uncovered, this dating method in relation to the pottery on site aids in determining the relative date of the site. Types of seriation Contextual: developed by Flinders Petrie, created sequences of assemblages and arranged them in what he thought was their chronological order based on the inventory of grave contents, his work in Egypt proved this to be a generally true reflection of their chronological sequences. Frequency: measures changes in abundance of a certain ceramic style. This technique was developed in a pioneering paper by W.S. Robinson and G.W. Brainerd, published in 1951. It was created because of artifacts in Mayan sites that had been recovered in the 1940s without stratigraphic context. The assumption was that certain styles of pottery were popular in certain times, and during that time, the popularity would reach a peak and then fade away. So, if a similar style of pottery was found at a different site, they must be from around the same time period. The European strategy would eventually makes its way into Americanist archaeology during the late 19th century, but it would not be until the second decade of the 20th century that sequence and detail became a part and parcel of archaeology method. Sequence dating has been deemed an obsolete and inaccurate method of dating archeological sites and artifacts, since archaeologists have discovered more precise methods of dating archeological sites and artifacts.

It is the home of the Hyolmo people. The word Helambu derives from the word Hyolmo. The Helambu region begins at the Lauribina La pass and descends to the Melamchi valley. Helambu is famous for its sweet apples. and artistic Buddhist monasteries and it is a Buddhist pilgrimage site. Several trekking routes visit Helambu, one of them being known as Helambu Trek.  Helambu Trek  MaginGoth Helambu Kutumsang Helambu This is a good trek for people who don't have much time in Nepal. It is an 8-day long trek which starts in Kathmandu itself, but can be completed in as little as 5‚Äì6 days. The normal trailhead starts off at Sundarijal and goes past Chisopani,Hyolmo, Kutumsang, Magin Goth, Tharepati, Malemchigaun, Nakote and Hyolmo, Tarke Gyang. After which you have the option of two roads one is the footpath via Sermathang or the bus route via Kiul Takpa Kharka. Kashye Both ways ultimately meet at Melemchi where you can take a bus back to Kathmandu. Another variation is the reverse of this trek. The maximum height reached during the trek is about 3650 m. The trek starts from Sundarijal (), a small dam and hydroelectric station in the north-east corner of Kathmandu Valley where the Himalayan Rescue Dog squad is headquartered. The trails begins west of Sundarijal at the end of the auto road where the large water pipe comes out of the hills. There is now bus service to Sundarijal from Boudhanath. A taxi can also be hired or you can walk. There is now daily jeep service from Sundarijal to Pati Bhanjyang. To walk begin at the bus park in Sundarijal and the large water pipe. Cross under the pipe and proceed along its west side much of the way is up stairs, continue. eventually turning left to cross over the dam of a water reservoir () in 40 minutes, Across the dam continue uphill crossing the water shed management road which winds around the hillside There is Lodge near here. Climb through wet sub tropical forest to an oak forest and on to Mulkharkha (), in an hour, This is a scattered Tamang village with lodges and view of Kathmandu Valley behind you. Don‚Äôt walk the next area alone, as there have been rare instances of attacks north of Mulkharkha. The trail continues up, first in open country and then in oak forest, often in small gully, and enters shivapuri watershed and wild life Research area, after passing an army station. The trails ascends to a pass Burlang Bhanjyang (8000 ft 2438 m) with houses and lodges and below it on the north side in 2 hours. This pass marks the Shivapuri ridges of the Kathmandu Valley's rim. The trails descends through a pleasant oak forest, past some houses and lodge on the left, Chisapani (7200 ft, 2194 m), meaning ‚Äò‚Äôcold water‚Äô‚Äô, to a flat portion where another trail joins from the right and a road crosses Ina clear weather there are good view of the Himalaya to the north and in the spring rhododendrons bloom. The trail continues to descend through open farmland to reach Pati Bhanjyan (5800 ft 1768 m), sitting in a saddle 13/4 hours from the Burlung Bhanjyang, There are lodges and a police check post here. From here there are two routes. One continues along the general ridge system heading north and eventually descend east to the Sherpa village of Melamchi Ghyanng. The other heads east, descends to the Melamchi Khola and proceeds up its east (left) bank towards Tarke Ghyang, situated opposite Melamchighyang on the east side of river. The ridge route goes much higher (almost to ) than the other route and other may be snow on its upper portions in the late winter or early spring. There are no permanent villages between Khutumsang and Melamchi Ghyang on this route, but leaving Khutumsang in the morning reach tharepati, where there are lodges. This is the part of the route that offers excellent views of the mountains. If it is cloudy which often happens late in the day, consider spending a night up high in a seasonal lodge or hopping for views in tharepati, then hope for good views the next morning. The circuit to the north along the ridge and the return via the east side of the Melamchi Khola Valley is described but if their weather is bad it is wise to head up the east side of the Melamchi Khola and when conditions have improved to return via the high route. In this case we follow the direction in reverse. Tharepati Helambu Route Near Chipling, 2150 m Malemchigaon, 2591 m The trek takes place in the Sherpa Helambu region, around 72 kilometers Northeast of Kathmandu. A roundabout circuit is used, most often starting at Sundarijal, although other starting positions include Nagarkot, Kakani or Sankhu. Pati Bhanjyan, Chipling, Khutumsang and Tharepati are amongst the first villages to be passed, followed by Malemchigaon, Nakote and Tarke Gyang . Two possible routes are available from Tarke Gyang, one to complete the trek and another that leads to the Arniko Highway, the main thoroughfare out of Kathmandu leading to Tibet. To complete the trek one would proceed to Taramarang following on to Pati Bhanjyan. From Pati Bhanjyan the trek returns to the starting point of Sundarijal, a route that takes around seven days.

Despite her many successes, her career was overshadowed by that of her more famous sister Irene Vanbrugh. Vanbrugh studied acting and made her professional debut in an 1886 burlesque. The same year, she made her West End theatre debut and then travelled to Margate to play leading roles in four of Shakespeare's plays. In 1889 she joined the Kendals at the Royal Court Theatre and on tour in the US Two years later, back in London, she joined Henry Irving and Ellen Terry in their famous Shakespeare company at the Lyceum Theatre. In 1893, she appeared opposite her husband Arthur Bourchier at Daly's Theatre and soon became his leading lady at the Royalty Theatre and then at the Garrick Theatre, where Bourchier was lessee for the first six years of the 20th century. Vanbrugh returned to Shakespearean roles in 1906 at Stratford upon Avon, where she played Lady Macbeth to her husband's Macbeth, and they soon starred together in Herbert Beerbohm Tree's London production of Henry VIII. They continued to play in Shakespeare and other pieces, and two films, through World War I, but their marriage ended in 1918. She continued acting steadily on stage and had some success in film in the 1930s, especially in Pygmalion in 1938. In her 50th season on stage, she starred in The Merry Wives of Windsor with her sister in London, and during The Blitz, they entertained at matinees. Her last film appearance was in 1940 in Young Man's Fancy. She died in London in 1942 at the age of 75. Biography Violet Augusta Mary Barnes was born in Exeter, England, the eldest of six children of the Rev Reginald Henry Barnes (1831‚Äì1889), Prebendary of Exeter Cathedral and Vicar of Heavitree, and his wife, Frances Mary Emily n√©e Nation.Littlewood, S. R. \\"Vanbrugh, Dame Irene (1872‚Äì1949)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2011, accessed 7 January 2011 She was the elder sister of the actress Irene Vanbrugh and the theatrical educator Kenneth Barnes. She grew up in Exeter and was then educated in France and Germany. Early career When Violet decided to enter the acting profession, the actress Ellen Terry, a family friend, suggested that she should adopt the stage name Vanbrugh. Violet's early success encouraged Irene to follow her into the profession, and she too took the stage surname Vanbrugh. Both sisters enrolled at Sarah Thorne's school of acting, based at Margate, which gave them a thorough practical grounding. Irene recalled, \\"We played every kind of play there; comedy, farce, and drama of the deepest dye; while at Christmas there came the pantomime, so that the Juliet of a week ago might be the Prince Paragon of the Yule-tide extravaganza.\\"Bacchus, Reginald, \\"Miss Irene Vanbrugh: Her Art and Herself,\\" The Ludgate, October 1899, p. 501 The sisters played together in As You Like It at the Theatre Royal, Margate, with Violet in the lead role, Rosalind, and Irene in the smaller part of Phoebe.\\"Dame Irene Vanbrugh\\", The Times, 1 December 1949, p. 7 Sir John Gielgud, a grand nephew of Ellen Terry, described the two: > The Vanbrugh sisters were remarkably alike in appearance. Tall and imposing, > beautifully spoken, they moved with grace. ... They were elegantly but never > ostentatiously dressed, entering and leaving the stage with unerring > authority. ... Violet never struck me as a natural comedienne, as Irene > was.Gielgud, p. 115 Ellen Terry helped Violet Vanbrugh land her first professional acting role in an 1886 burlesque, by F. C. Burnand, Faust and Loose, at Toole's Theatre. The same year, she made her West End theatre debut as Ellen in The Little Pilgrims. She then toured and also returned to Toole's, playing several roles until 1887 including Lady Anne in The Butler. Returning to Margate later that year, she appeared in Shakespeare's Hamlet as Ophelia, in A Midsummer Night's Dream as Helena, in As You Like It as Rosalind and in The Merchant of Venice as Portia. In London in 1888, she played Gertrude in the Deputy Registrar. In 1889 she joined the Kendals at the Royal Court Theatre as Lady Gillingham in The Weaker Sex, and at the end of the year travelled with them to the US, where she played Lady Ingram in the comedy A Scrap of Paper and in dramas such as The Iron Master, Impulse and A White Lie and comedies such The Weaker Sex. Back in England in 1891, she joined Henry Irving and Ellen Terry at the Lyceum Theatre as Anne Boleyn in his successful revival of King Henry VIII. She also understudied Terry in several roles. Bourchier and later years In The Fairy's Dilemma, 1904 In 1893, she appeared together with Arthur Bourchier in Augustin Daly's production of Love in Tandem at Daly's Theatre, and the two married the following year.\\"Marriage of Mr. Arthur Bouchier and Miss Violet Vanbrugh (Barnes), Western Times, 11 December 1894, p. 7 In 1895, Bourchier became lessee of the Royalty Theatre, and Vanbrugh became his leading lady in many productions, including The Chilli Widow, Mr and Mrs, Monsieur de Paris and The Queens Proctor. Bourchier, Vanbrugh and her sister Irene toured America beginning in 1897. Returning to England, Vanbrugh played the title role in Teresa, which Bourchier produced at the Metropole. After managing several productions with Charles Wyndham, Bourchier became lessee of the Garrick Theatre. Harold Acton, in Memoirs of an Aesthete described his childhood impression of Vanbrugh: \\"Immensely tall, sedate, angular, sharp nosed, and dressed as another herbaceous border, she ate her supper haughtily, like a deaconess. I could not imagine ... the hero embracing her: unless he were equally tall he would have to climb on a chair.\\"Acton, Harold. Memoirs of an Aesthete, London, Methuen, 1948 In 1902, Vanbrugh and Bourchier had a child, Prudence Bourchier, who also became an actress, taking the stage name Vanbrugh. Arthur Bourchier Over the six years of Bourchier's management at the Garrick, Vanbrugh starred in many of his productions, including The Bishop's Move, My Lady Virtue, Whitewashing Julia, The Arm of the Law and W. S. Gilbert's The Fairy's Dilemma (1904). Their production of The Walls of Jericho by Alfred Sutro in 1904, ran for a very successful 423 performances. In 1905, Violet reprised her role of Portia in Bourchier's production of The Merchant of Venice and again in a command performance for King Edward at Windsor Castle. In 1906, at Stratford upon Avon, she played Lady Macbeth to her husband's Macbeth. Vanbrugh and Bourchier toured in 1908 in John Glayde's Honour and appeared together as King Henry and Queen Katherine in Sir Herbert Tree's successful production of Henry VIII, which was followed by Tree's silent film of the play.Hamilton Ball, Robert. \\"The Shakespeare Film as Record: Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree\\", Shakespeare Quarterly, Volume 3, No. 3, July 1952, pp. 227‚Äì36 In 1913, she appeared in Mrs. Pomeroy's Reputation by Horace Annesley Vachell and Thomas Cobb at The Queen's Theatre. They then produced their own movie in Germany of scenes from Macbeth. They continued to play in Shakespeare and other pieces through World War I, but their marriage was becoming difficult. They toured together in 1916 but then separated and finally divorced in 1918.\\"Miss Violet Vanbrugh Obtains a Decree Nisi\\", Western Times, 21 December 1917, p. 5 A contemporary later observed, \\"He treated her very much as Henry VIII treated Anne Boleyn ‚Äì except he didn't quite cut off her head.\\"Trewin, J. C. and Robert Speaight: Shakespeare Quarterly, Volume 28, No. 2 (Spring, 1977), p. 135 Bourchier remarried a much younger actress, Violet Marion Kyrle Bellew, but Vanbrugh never remarried. Vanbrugh continued acting steadily until 1939, playing with much success in Thunder in the Air as Mrs Vexted in 1928. She also appeared in three further films during the 1930s, including Pygmalion (1938), together with Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller.

YouTube, 25 April 2018. was a bassist, keyboardist, guitar soloist, arranger, composer and Grammy-nominated producer from Senegal. He was mostly known as the musical director for Youssou N'dour's Super √âtoile de Dakar. He was one of the most talented African bassists of the last quarter- century. He played the bass and produced music for Super Etoile since 1984 or earlier. He was believed to have picked up the bass when he was 13, but started his musical exploration at the age of nine, thanks to his older brother, Vieux Mac Faye, who is an accomplished guitarist himself. His other brothers are musicians as well. Lamine Faye is one of Senegal's most popular and respected guitar players, and for a long time was a member of Super Diamono, before he left to form his own band, Lemzo Diamono, in 1991. Adama Faye, who died in 2005, is regarded as one of the pioneers of keyboard playing in Senegal. He was one of the founding members of Super Diamono and also played keys for Super Etoile back in the 1980s. The Faye brothers are, in many ways, very similar to the Wooten Brothers, although they never formed a band. Super Etoile is one of Africa's best live bands, and they have been traveling all over the world for nearly three decades. In fact, in November 2007, music critic Robert Christgau said on NPR's All Songs Considered that he believed Youssou N'Dour's band is the world's best live band. Habib Faye cites the Amnesty International's \\"Human Rights Now\\" world tour in 1988 as maybe his most rewarding time as a musician. He says that it allowed him to grow as a bassist as he got to share the stage with music icons, such as Peter Gabriel, Sting, Tracy Chapman, and Bruce Springsteen. It is also in the middle of that tour that the album The Lion, in which Peter Gabriel participated, was recorded. Gabriel would invite Habib to join him on other records of his own later on. In 1996, Mickey Hart hired him to play bass parts on his Mystery Box album. Habib Faye's resume also includes playing alongside a wide range of artists like Manu Katche, Mokhtar Samba, Joe Zawinul, Paco Sery, Gilberto Gil, Chet Atkins, Mark Knopfler, Branford Marsalis, Poogie Bell, David Sancious, Lionel Loueke, Tania St Val, Jacob Devarieux, David Sanborn, Brazil's Carlinhos Brown, just to name a few. He had produced albums for Senegal's top- selling artists such as Viviane Ndour and Kin√© Lam. In Senegal, Faye was regarded as a true genius as he had taken the bass to a completely new level in this West African nation. He was one of bass players in Senegal that brought the bass to the forefront and made it an instrument to be reckoned with. The song \\"Bekoor\\", from Youssou N‚ÄôDour's 1984 album Badou, is a reference for many Senegalese bassists. He has produced virtually every Youssou N‚ÄôDour album since 1984, including the acclaimed 1994 The Guide. In addition to having years of gigging under his belt, producing and touring with Super √âtoile, he has been involved in many musical projects in Senegal, working with local artists. The latest is Abdou Guit√© Seck, Wock's former vocalist, who is now pursuing a solo career. His latest album is slated for release later this year. Habib's force is his versatility. He grew up in an environment where music had no boundaries. His parents grew up dancing Salsa and rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll. He also grew up seeing his older brothers experimenting with jazz and blues sonorities. He can virtually play any style, from the rootsiest Mbalax (Senegal's predominant musical style) to the grooviest Funk, not to mention Afrobeat and jazz. Harmattan, the first band he founded, was one of the headlining acts at the 1998 edition of Saint-Louis International Jazz Festival, Senegal, one of the most prominent jazz festivals in Africa. In recent years, Habib had focusing on the new Afro-jazz band he occasionally put together, Habib Faye Quartet, often changing the line-up. As far as his music philosophy was concerned, he explained that he was not trying to compete with jazz musicians or do pure jazz, but he tried to bring two different worlds together, i.e. the richness of the African sound and the world of jazz. He took the blend of African music and jazz to a new level adding traditional African instruments such as Kora, Sabar, Tama, and lesser-known ones. African music being very percussion-oriented, Habib developed a technique where he can often be heard playing percussion parts on his bass. That has the effect of making his sound far more rhythmic and distinctive. His brand of Mbalax that can be heard in most Youssou N‚ÄôDour albums, especially those released on the Senegalese market, puts percussive bass playing to the fore. With that he gave more power to the afore-mentioned African traditional instruments. His experiments culminated into the release of a live album, only available in Senegal, Special tribute to Jaco Pastorius, Live at \\"Central Park\\" Dakar. You can hear him on the album revisit some of Jaco's best known lines during his Weather Report years, adding an African twist to it. Habib Faye's musicianship didn't stop at the bass; he was also an experienced keyboard player. He can be heard playing keyboard bass on countless Super √âtoile tunes. He was one of the finest keyboard bassists out there. He pioneered marimba keyboard playing in Senegalese music, and it is the most popular style in Senegal right now. Paradoxically, he thought that producers were stuck with it and seemed not to want to look further. The lack of creativity on the part of some Senegalese musical directors worried him particularly. His work on guitar was no less important. All of that was evidenced in Youssou N‚ÄôDour's Live at Union Chapel DVD released in 2003. In 2006, Faye flew to New York to work with Ang√©lique Kidjo on her latest album, Djin Djin , released on May 1, 2007. Kidjo's website credits him as the \\"Senegalese bass giant\\". Djin Djin, which won a Grammy award in 2008, features a myriad of stars, including Alicia Keys, Peter Gabriel, Carlos Santana, Josh Groban, and Branford Marsalis. Faye had toured with Kidjo and they recently played the North Sea Jazz Festival in the Netherlands. In March 2008, Faye continued his jazz experiments when he brought Lionel Loueke, Herbie Hancock‚Äôs guitar player, and Mokhtar Samba, one of Africa‚Äôs premier drummers, to Dakar for a series of Afro-jazz concerts. The act was dubbed the \\"trio magique\\". Habib endorsed De Gier basses in July 2008. The Dutch guitar maker credits him on its website as \\"an amazing bass player\\". Habib Faye had been working on his debut album that was initially slated for release in 2009, but was still in the works. On Wednesday April 25, 2018, he died aged 52, in Paris, where he was being treated for a lung infection.\\"Le musicien S√©n√©galais Habib Faye est d√©c√©d√©\\", Jeune Afrique, April 25, 2018. His death sent shockwaves throughout his native country of Senegal and the musical world. This forced Youssou Ndour to cancel his concert in Kigali to fly back home with the rest of the Super Etoile in order to pay tribute to their fallen brother.

Headquartered at the Hart-Dole-Inouye Federal Center in Battle Creek, Michigan, the organization provides personnel to support the US military in 16 overseas deployments, including Iraq and Afghanistan, 2 US territories (Guam and Puerto Rico) and 41 states.  History  A congressional report in 1972 recommended centralizing the disposal of United States Department of Defense (DoD) property for better accountability. In response, on September 12, 1972, the Defense Supply Agency (now known as the Defense Logistics Agency) established the Defense Property Disposal Service (renamed the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service in 1985) in Battle Creek, Michigan, as a primary-level field activity. On July 19, 2010, as part of a \\"We Are DLA\\" initiative, the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service was renamed the Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services. Functions DLA Disposition Services disposes of the military's excess property. It does this through: *reutilization within the DoD *transfer to other federal agencies *donation to state and local governments Excess materiel may also be used for: *emergency management in the US *humanitarian aid worldwide *foreign military sales programs Excess property that is not disposed of in these ways may be subsequently offered for sale to the public. DLA Disposition Services is also responsible for the management and disposal of hazardous property for DoD activities, maximizing the use of each item and minimizing environmental risks and costs, and retains a legal responsibility for DoD waste even after it has been passed on to private contractors. Iraq waste controversy DLA Disposition Services has a legal responsibility for US military waste even after it has been passed on to private contractors. In 2010 an investigation by The Times newspaper in five Iraqi provinces discovered that hazardous waste from US bases was being dumped locally by subcontracted waste firms rather than transported back to the US by ship via the Iraqi port of Umm Qasr or recycled in purpose built facilities in northern and western Iraq, as required by DoD rules. Major General Kendall P. Cox Sr., responsible for engineering and infrastructure in Iraq, said: \\"As you know we have been here for over seven years. In that period we have accumulated several million pounds of hazardous waste‚Ä¶ I think perhaps the lesson is that we create hazardous waste treatment centers earlier if there is a potential for us to have a long-term presence.\\" Brigadier General Stephen R. Lanza, the US military spokesman in Iraq, said: \\"We take this issue very seriously and want to solve the problem. There is a variety of ways in which this [dumping] could have happened. We are now putting a system into place. There is a lot of catching up to do... Those responsible for this will be punished. It is something that once brought to our attention, we take very seriously.\\" The owner of one Iraqi company involved in the disposal of US military waste said: \\"The Americans properly separate the hazardous material from the plastic and scrap metal, and then pass it on to Kuwaiti and Lebanese companies. Some of the companies then mix it back together and pass it on to Iraqi companies. That's how they get rid of things.\\" Excess Property Program The DoD Excess Property Program (1033 program, formerly the 1208 program) is a Defense Logistics Agency program to transfer leftover military materiel (supplies and equipment) to U.S. state and local civilian law enforcement agencies. The surplus equipment includes grenade launchers, helicopters, military robots, M-16 service rifles, armored vehicles, riverboats, Battle Dress Uniform clothing, and information technology equipment. In 2011, the program resulted in the DoD giving away nearly $500 million worth of equipment, while in 2010, $212 million in gear were distributed. The 1033 program has been linked with perceived militarization of US law enforcement agencies and local police, especially following riots and the police response in the aftermath of the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC- Decoder/2014/0816/Ferguson-How-Pentagon-s-1033-program-helped-militarize- small-town-police-videohttp://www.newsweek.com/how-americas-police-became- army-1033-program-264537 References  External links  *Defense Logistics Agency *DLA Disposition Services Category:Defense Logistics Agency ","title":"DLA Disposition Services"},{"id":"8085706","text":"Alexander McDonald (5 November 1937 - 17 March 2016) was a Scottish minister of the Church of Scotland who served as the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland from 1997 to 1998.

He served with distinction in the War of the Polish Succession and the War of the Austrian Succession. During the Seven Years' War, he was second-in- command to Louis-Joseph de Montcalm in the defense of New France and then, after the surrender of New France in 1760, he served in Europe. After the war, he was appointed Governor of Artois, and in 1783 he was made a Marshal of France. North American military service In 1756, the Marquis de Vaudreuil was informed that King Louis XV of France was sending the Marquis Louis-Joseph de Montcalm to take over French forces in North America, with L√©vis as second in command. Vaudreuil wrote back that there was no need to send another general, as Vaudreuil disliked the tactics of most \\"municipal\\" French generals. When Montcalm arrived despite Vaudreuil's protest, the two men developed a dislike for each other. L√©vis diplomatically cultivated good relations with both men, and managed to avoid getting dragged into the feuds between the two. L√©vis led the vanguard of the French expedition to Fort William Henry in 1757, and laid siege to it until Montcalm's arrival. During French planning for the 1758 campaign in the French and Indian War the disputes between Vaudreuil and Montcalm continued. Vaudreuil prevailed, and Montcalm was sent to Fort Carillon to defend it against an expected British attack. L√©vis was initially slated to lead an expedition to the western forts, leading about 500 French metropolitan troops and a large seasoned French- Canadian militia. Vaudreuil, however, had second thoughts, and dispatched L√©vis and his metropolitan troops to support Montcalm at Carillon. L√©vis arrived at Carillon on the evening of July 7, as a British army was arriving before the fort. The next day, in a stroke of good fortune for the defenders, the 16,000 strong British army under the command of General James Abercrombie decided to frontally attack the French defenses manned by about 4,000 men, without the benefit of artillery support. In the Battle of Carillon, the British were decisively defeated, with L√©vis leading the defense on the French right flank. General L√©vis encouraging his French army at the battle of Sainte-Foy When the forces of James Murray arrived to begin the Siege of Quebec, L√©vis participated in the early defenses, including the Battle of Beauport. He was then sent to organize the defense of Montreal, and so was not present when Quebec fell. Following Montcalm's death in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, L√©vis was appointed commander of French forces in North America. Wintering at Montreal, L√©vis managed to rally his troops and train them for a spring offensive to recapture Quebec in 1760. Marching downstream with the first breaking of the ice, L√©vis met the forces of James Murray at the Battle of Sainte-Foy, where L√©vis' army won a victory in one of the bloodiest battles ever fought on Canadian soil.Stephen Brumwell Redcoats: The British Soldier and War in the Americas, 1755-1763 (NY: Cambridge University Press, 2002), p. 259 This forced Murray to retreat behind Quebec's walls and a siege began. The lack of artillery and siege equipment precluded any assault on the fortifications of Quebec and L√©vis held back, awaiting reinforcements from Europe. With the arrival of a British squadron which then destroyed his support ships on the Saint Lawrence, L√©vis was obliged to retreat to Montreal, where Vaudreuil eventually surrendered New France to Amherst's army, which had advanced down the Saint Lawrence River that summer, in early September. L√©vis, unhappy with the terms of capitulation, which did not include the traditional \\"honors of war\\", decided to burn the regimental colors rather than turning them over to the British. His various letters for this period were later collected and published by Beauchemin in 1889;gallica.bnf.fr: \\"Lettres du chevalier de L√©vis concernant la guerre du Canada (1756-1760)\\" letters to him for this period were published by the Abbe Casgrain, a professor at Universite Laval, in 1895;gallica.bnf.fr: \\"Lettres de divers particuliers au chevalier de L√©vis / publ. sous la dir. de l'abb√© H.-R.

Casgrain\\" Retirement Fran√ßois Gaston de L√©vis sculpture in front of Parliament Building (Quebec) L√©vis returned to France on parole, and was released for service in Europe by William Pitt. He served in the German campaigns of 1762, and retired from active military service when the war ended in 1763 with the Peace of Paris. He was appointed governor of Artois in 1765. He was promoted to Marshal of France in 1783, and was raised to the inheritable title Duc de L√©vis in 1784. He died in 1787 in Arras, France, and was succeeded as duke of L√©vis by his son Pierre-Marc-Gaston, who escaped to England during the French Revolution. In 1794 his widow and two of his three daughters were sent to the guillotine during the French Revolution. He left his name to L√©vis, Quebec, across the river from Quebec City.

From December to March, the temperatures go low below the freezing point, and heavy snowfall occur up to one meter, blocking the way to the lake. April to June is warm in this region. Monsoon season, which in this region occurs between the months of July to October, is short. The average rainfall during the ten-year period 1994‚Äì2003 was 800 mm. The surface temperature of the lake was found to be 7.5 ¬∞C to 7.6 ¬∞C and was visible below 14 m to 15 m. Socio-cultural and religious values The main occupation of the people living around the area is agriculture. People also rear goats and extract medicinal herbs and sell them for their living. Thakur society is dominant in the community. Thakur Baba‚Äôs Temple is situated in the southeast corner of the lake. Local people believe that the god Thakur shot an arrow to open the passage of the lake reducing the damage caused by flooding.  Environmental issues  Due to over-grazing and defecation, the national park conservation officers are facing a challenge to preserve the lake. Local people are found cutting timber wood and fuel wood, which is a problem for conservation of Rara. Also during festivals visitors and local people produce a lot of wastage causing water pollution. Flora and fauna left Rara Lake, being surrounded by Rara National Park, has unique floral and faunal importance with rare and vulnerable species. The park was established in 1976 to preserve the beauty of the lake and protect it from sedimentation and adverse human activities. The Park flora consists of 1074 species, of which 16 are endemic to Nepal; the fauna includes 51 species of mammals and 214 species of birds.Rara National Park.(n.d.). Retrieved from http://icimod.org/hkhconservationportal/PA.aspx?ID=64 The lake holds three endemic fish species Nepalese snowtrout (Schizothorax macrophthalmus), (S. nepalensis) and the Rara snowtrout (S. raraensis) and one endemic frog, Rara Lake frog (Nanorana rarica). Winter visitor water birds such as gadwall (Anas strepera), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), northern shoveler (Anas clypeata), common teal (Anas crecca), tufted duck (Aythya fuligula), common golden eye (Bucephala clangula), common merganser (Mergus merganser), common coot (Fulica atra), and solitary snipe (Gallinago solitaria) reside and rest at this lake  Transport  Tara Air taxiing down the runway in Talcha Airport Air is the only mode of transportation for the tourists visiting the lake. Rara Lake is served by Talcha Airport, which is 4 km east of the lake. Nepal Airlines and Tara Air operate flights to Rara from Nepalgunj Airport. It takes approx 2 hours to reach Rara Lake from the airport on foot.  Tourism  Rara lake has been a popular destination with a very rough route in Western Nepal for trekkers. The glimpses of culture and scenery on the way is quite different from the rest of Nepal. Situated in high altitude, you can find the lake surrounded by Rara National Park with pine, spruce and juniper forest. The view of snow-capped Himalayan peaks enhance the attraction of trekkers. The trek begins with flight to Jumla (over an hour flight from Kathmandu) or from nearer Nepalgunj. Going along the mountain path and some villages one can reach the bank of Rara lake. A travel writer wrote: > Although more trampled than in the past, the road to Rara Lake is still > without any of the comfortable services available along more popular trails. > Logistically it is not an easy trek; it is hard to get to and from, and it > is an organizational challenge, requiring informed guides and porters to > tote the two weeks' worth of material that will keep you warm, dry and fed. > It is also tough on the bones, involving several 11,000-foot passes. > However, once you overcome the obstacles, the rewards are legion: few if any > other trekkers, incomparable natural splendor, \\"untouched\\" villages, > blissful quiet.‚Ä¶ Rara Lake as described by GORP founder Bill Greer is \\"a shimmering blue jewel set in a ring of snowy peaks\\". Similarly, Mark Drett, talking about Rara Lake, said: \\"Since the interval of 10 years, I visited again. Before 10 years, we needed to walk 19 days to get there but that has been reduced to 10 hours of gravel road and 4 hours of walk. Not expected but great change. When you get there, you will get the reward for 4 hour long walk.\\" Trekkers are recommended to bring their own first aid kit due to the lack of health services around the area. Since there are no accommodation facilities they may need help from a travel agency. Trekkers need to be self-sufficient as the facilities are not adequate. Rara has the potential of becoming the next major place for tourists to visit. During 1997‚Äì1998, the number of tourists visiting to this place was found to be 560, but in 2007 it decreased to 87 individuals. Rara Festival was conducted by the Nepal Tourism Board in early 2007 to promote domestic and international visit.

He also wrote numerous outdoors-oriented short stories for magazines such as Boys' Life and The Outdoorsman. Life and work Anderson was born in Trenton, New Jersey. He attended Lehigh University, where he was a member of the gymnastics team, specializing in the flying rings. He graduated in 1901 and worked in electrical engineering before taking up photography in 1907. He was influenced by the photographs in the magazine Camera Work. In 1910 he started working as a professional photographer. A self-taught and award-winning photographer, Anderson worked within the mainstream pictorialist aesthetic of his day. Yet at the same time, drawing upon his engineering background, he applied a methodical and experimental approach within his creative process in order to advance his artistic ideals. Anderson was close friends with Karl Struss, whose positive meniscus Struss Pictorial Lens he favored. In 1910, Anderson married Mary Lyon Green, with whom he had two daughters, born in 1912 and 1916. Prior to World War I, he operated portrait studios in New York City and East Orange, New Jersey. In 1916 and 1917, he taught at the Clarence H. White School of Photography, founded by Clarence Hudson White, 1914‚Äì1918, and published several books and articles on photography. He set aside his writing on photography in 1925 and started instead to write fiction, beginning with short stories and two novels about student life at a boys' prep school in the fictional New England town of Lockport; he later followed with the five novels of his Roman Life and Times series, which have never been out of print since their initial publication. He returned to writing on photography some eight years later, at the same time continuing his fiction-writing career, which came to a close in 1939 with the publication of Pugnax the Gladiator. According to family lore as related by his elder daughter, Anderson was good friends with Edward Weston. The two disagreed vehemently on photographic style with regard to the artistic value of sharp focus (Weston's preference) versus soft focus (Anderson's style). Anderson put an end to the disagreement by producing a wire-sharp picture of a dead mackerel on a plate.Binder, Richard F. (son of Anderson's elder daughter), personal recollection Some of his photography is displayed at the Cleveland Museum of Art.

He is said to have reigned thirty-seven years, and to have been succeeded by Procas, the father of Amulius. Servius, in analysing Virgil's Aeneid, Book vii. 656, speaks of an Aventinus, a king of the aboriginal inhabitants of Rome, who was killed and buried on the hill afterwards called the Aventine Hill. This king may be conflated with this one or with a separate figure in the Aeneid: :\\"The Aventine is a hill in the city of Rome. It is accepted that it derives its name from birds (aves) which, rising from the Tiber, nested there (as we read in the eighth book of a suitable home for the nests of ill-omened birds). This is because of a king of the Aboriginal Italians, Aventinus by name, who was both killed and buried there - just as the Alban king Aventinus was, he who was succeeded by Procas. Varro, however, states that amongst the Roman people, the Sabines accepted this mountain when it was offered them by Romulus, and called it the Aventine after the Aventus river in its area. It is therefore accepted that these different opinions came later, for in the beginning it was called Aventinus after either the birds or the Aboriginal King: from which it is accepted that the son of Hercules mentioned here took his name from that of the hill, not vice versa.\\" Family tree References  Sources  * Liv. i. 3 * Dionys. i. 71 * Ovid, Fasti iv. 51. * Smith, Biographical Dictionary Category:Kings of Alba Longa Category:Roman mythology ","title":"Aventinus of Alba Longa"},{"id":"8085822","text":"The Church of St Thomas the Martyr (now known as St Thomas' Newcastle), Newcastle upon Tyne, is one of the most prominent city centre landmarks, located close to both universities, the city hall and main shopping district in the Haymarket. It is a 19th-century Anglican re-foundation of a medieval chapel, traditionally said to have been created by one of the assassins of Thomas Becket. Revitalised and appointed as Resource Church for the Diocese of Newcastle in 2019 with a new minister and staff team, it is now a growing church popular with students and young adults. History Dedication and foundation The church is dedicated to St Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, who was murdered in 1170 by a group of four English knights acting ‚Äì so they mistakenly believed ‚Äì on the orders of Henry II. Since Becket had defended the privileges of the Church against Henry, he was regarded as a martyr and canonized in 1173. The four murderers were instructed, in order to atone for their sins, to serve a period as confreres (associate brothers) of the Knights Templar, but it is believed that one of them, Hugh de Morville, also elected to found a chapel dedicated to the saint as a private penance. It was this chapel which would eventually become the Church of St Thomas the Martyr. The precise foundation date is uncertain, but probably in the 1170s, and certainly by the early 13th century.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no- series/newcastle-historical-account/pp357-362 De Morville‚Äôs chapel De Morville ‚Äì if indeed he was responsible (there is no absolute proof) ‚Äì set up his chapel at a riverside location, next to what is now the Swing Bridge but what was then a wooden affair and the only bridge across the Tyne at Newcastle. By 1248 both bridge and chapel were in the care of a Keeper, known only as Lawrence. In that year much of the town was destroyed by fire; the chapel escaped, but the bridge was badly damaged and Lawrence was given responsibility for raising money for rebuilding, which included the reconstruction of the bridge in stone. In 1329 one William Heron founded a Chantry within St Thomas‚Äô, dedicated to St Anne and endowed with ¬£4 17s per annum;http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/newcastle-historical- account/pp357-362 a second Chantry, dedicated to St Mary, had ¬£4 3s 6d a year. In 1339 the chapel bridge was once more severely damaged, this time by flood, and it remained ruinous for much of the 14th century. The chapel possessed three cellars, one of which was rented out by William Spyn, the then chaplain, at 14 shillings a year in 1347. Further income was raised through a windmill below Jesmond (confirmed as the chapel's property in 1408) and more land, in Whickham, left to the chapel in the will of Roger Thornton in 1429. St Mary Magdalene‚Äôs Hospital and the move to the new site The Hospital of St Mary Magdalene was founded just outside Newcastle by Henry I to cater for those afflicted with leprosy, a disease brought to the Country by returning Crusaders. The hospital was located near what is now the northern end of Northumberland Street. Although a religious house, the hospital was overlooked in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century English Reformation, and the Hospital continues to operate into the present day, though evolving into a charity rather than a working hospital by the early 19th century. James I incorporated the hospital and the Chapel of St Thomas the Martyr into a single institution under the government of a Master, the first of these being a Mr Jennison. In 1732 the Mayor and Corporation of Newcastle, who acted as patrons of the united hospital and chapel and who were empowered to alter the statutes, beautified the chapel and made it a Chapel of ease for St Nicholas Church. At that time it seated 300 people. Alterations were made to the chapel in 1770 and subsequently, but it was damaged in a great flood in 1771. Although the building was not substantially affected, by 1827 it was felt the old chapel needed replacing and it was closed in March that year, with a replacement built on the site of St Mary Magdalene's Hospital. The new church Interior looking towards the altar The Newcastle architect John Dobson was hired to design the new church, and he produced an elegant Gothic- style building at a cost of ¬£6000. The present church was built by John Dobson, between 1827 and 1830. Galleries were added in 1837 and the seating was replaced in 1881. In 1972 the level of the High Altar was lowered, the chancel screen removed and the chancel extended into the nave, with a nave altar. The present church is a Grade II* Listed Building. Exodus to Jesmond The nearby Jesmond Parish Church had a slightly unusual beginning. 1856 saw the untimely death of Rev Richard Clayton, Master of St Thomas's, and a local evangelical light. In his place the church authorities wished to appoint a successor, Clement Moody, who did not share Clayton's concern to teach the Bible. A large number of the congregation of St Thomas's were deeply unhappy. A committee was formed with the intention of planting a new church nearby, which \\"will form a central point for the maintenance and promulgation of sound scriptural and evangelical truth in a large and populous town.\\" At the time, much of the land around the new site was open fields; the new building was designed by the architect John Dobson and consecrated in 1861. The modern church Legal status The modern St Thomas the Martyr has no parish, but neither is it a Peculiar (ecclesiastical enclave), making it unique in the Church of England. It is governed by the Body Corporate (comprising the senior priest and Churchwardens) and ultimately through Acts of Parliament. It lies within the Diocese of Newcastle, the Archdeaconry of Northumberland and the Deanery of Newcastle. It was formally separated from the Hospital of St Mary Magdalene in 1978, but the senior priest of the church is still referred to as the Master. Services and civic function Despite having no parish, the church maintains a normal routine of regular weekly services. Currently, these consist of a traditional 10am Communion service (Eucharist) and a contemporary 4pm service on Sundays and a service of Holy Communion at 12.15pm on Wednesdays. However, the church is regarded as serving the whole city, the universities and various organisations and communities. Consequently, it serves as the venue for a busy programme of civic and private services. Its proximity to the City Hall and to both Newcastle and Northumbria Universities mean it acts as semi-official church to these institutions, but it also provides regular services for the Royal British Legion, various Regimental Associations and the Mothers‚Äô Union, amongst other groups. In recent years, conductor and organist Miles Cragg has presided at the organ for a number of carol services. A choir comprising members of King's College, later Newcastle University, always sang at the University Carol Service in December and occasionally for funerals of members of staff of the University. St Thomas' launched in October 2019 as the Resource Church for the Diocese of Newcastle. A new staff team were employed and a team from St Michael le Belfrey in York was sent to relaunch the church. The congregation very quickly grew and the church now attracts large numbers of young people each week. Ethos St Thomas's has a reputation for involvement in social issues, most notably trade justice, developing countries' debt and related subjects. This has been expressed through major campaigns, such as involvement in the Jubilee 2000 and Make Poverty History movements, and also on a smaller scale, such as support for Fair Trade and sale of fairly traded goods in the church's One World Shop. In addition a variety of national, international and local charitable causes are supported through a range of methods. The organ An organ was built in the church by Elliot and Hill in 1832. A new organ by Vincent and Co. replaced the Elliot and Hill instrument in 1902, which was rebuilt by Binns, Fitton and Haley in 1931. This in turn was extensively rebuilt by Harrison and Harrison in 1961. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

CRIS systems are also known as Research Information Management or RIM Systems (RIMS).Bryant, Rebecca et al (2017). ‚ÄúResearch Information Management: Defining RIM and the Library‚Äôs Role‚Äù  Features  The data model underpinning a CRIS relies on a set of basic entities as defined by the Common European Research Information Format (CERIF) model maintained by the non-profit organisation euroCRIS. The links connecting these entities provide a standardised semantic layer that provides consistency to the data model. The basic CERIF entities are people, organisations, projects and outputs (publications, research data, patents). Further second- level entities in the comprehensive snapshot of research provided by CERIF are for instance funding, research facilities and equipment or skills. System interoperability lies at the core of CRIS operation, both from an internal and an external viewpoint. Internally, information is exchanged between the multiple information-gathering systems at institutions (HR systems, project management tools, finance management systems, etc.) and the one-stop-shop CRIS where all the institutional research information is kept. From an external interoperability perspective, metadata need to be exchanged between the systems at research-performing organisations where the research is actually conducted and the systems run by research funders and governmental bodies in charge of research assessment processes.Clements, Anna et al (2016). ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Talk : Interoperability between University CRIS/IR and Researchfish ‚Äì a case study from the UK‚Äù. \\"Communicating and Measuring Research Responsibly: Profiling, Metrics, Impact, Interoperability\\": Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Current Research Information Systems (2016).

While these two kinds of systems were once seen as competing with each other, nowadays they tend to work together via efficient mechanisms for information exchange around research outputs and their associated metadata. Recent developments in furthering the interoperability between these systems has led to their merging into a single CRIS/repository systems.DSpace-CRIS and Haplo are two recent examples for integrated systems This is the so-called CRIS/repository integration.De Castro, Pablo; Shearer, Kathleen; Summann, Friedrich (2014). \\"The gradual merging of repository and CRIS solutions to meet institutional research information management requirements\\". \\"Managing Data-Intensive Science: the Role of Research Information Systems in Realising the Digital Agenda\\": Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Current Research Information Systems (2014).

From a system perspective, they can be commercial platforms provided by vendors, in-house-built systems or community-driven open source platforms.

Among the key applications of the aggregated pool of research information collected in CRIS system it‚Äôs worth mentioning the following areas.  Research assessment As mentioned in the ‚ÄúPractices and Patterns‚Äù report, research assessment is one of the key drivers for the implementations of CRIS systems, especially at research-performing organisations. This is due to the need for all institutional research outputs to be collected and described in a standardised way in a single institutional system that is also able to gather information on impact indicators. A particularly important example of this connection is the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF), whose 2014 edition resulted in a widespread adoption of commercial CRIS systems by UK institutions.Russell, Rosemary (2013) \\"CERIF CRIS UK landscape study: work in progress report\\", euroCRIS Membership Meeting Spring 2013 (DFG, Bonn, May 13‚Äì14, 2013)  Research administration  As a one-stop-shop for storing all the information related to the institutional research activity, CRIS systems play a key role in the area of research administration by institutional Research Offices. Among many others, this involves aspects such as: * Research impact and its analysis * Research collaborations across institutions and with Industry * Preparation of project proposals and subsequent management of awarded grants * Knowledge Exchange  Open Science implementation  Where available, CRIS systems are often key components in the Open Science implementation strategy at research-performing organisationsDe Castro, Pablo (2019). \\"The role of Current Research Information Systems (CRIS) in supporting Open Science implementation : the case of Strathclyde\\".

The episode name is a reference to a verse from the 1860 hymn, \\"Eternal Father, Strong to Save.\\" This episode is also known as \\"The Lost Island of Munga\\" and \\"A High-Sea Adventure\\". The episode was written by The Goodies, with songs and music by Bill Oddie. Plot The Goodies decide to set out in a small boat to search for the Lost Island of Munga. Bill wants to go on the voyage as a pirate, Graeme decides to go as a viking and Tim goes as a captain. They have problems at sea, but 'rescue' comes in the form of a large ship which turns out be an oil tanker. The Goodies are welcomed by the oil millionaire. They pretend to be sailors, and almost get away with their imposture. However, they are let down by their ignorance that sailors' bell- bottom trousers have real bells attached to them and none of the Goodies are able to lower their singing voices to reach the deepest and lowest note of the verse of the song There Is Nothing Like a Dame. Then Tim, Graeme and Bill are tossed overboard. The Goodies swim ashore and find that they have reached the Lost Island of Munga, where strange natives are dumping sliced potatoes into the sea. The Goodies investigate the beach cabin and meet the property developer. To the Goodies' horror they discover the millionaire and the developer is their old enemy, the \\"Music Master\\" (who is now going by the name \\"Nasty Person\\"), and his servant \\"Gerald\\". Nasty Person plans to fill the oceans with potato slices and oil; once saturated, he'll light a match o the mixture and there'll be fish and chips everywhere!!! The Goodies also discover that Nasty Person has set up a tourist trade on the island and that the local people are all working for him, so Graeme tricks Nasty Person with a pencil that contains poison gas and locks him in a cupboard. As The Goodies try to think up a plan to save Munga, Graeme remembers reading his book about Vikings who are caught by a storm, so the trio and the natives perform the rain dance and are blown away by the strong wind and return home.

He has competed in aerobatics, designed aircraft, and promoted aviation and vintage aircraft restoration. Oil and gas royaltiesFamous Astronaut visits Fantasy of Flight!, \\"...the lawyer that negotiated my famous geologist grandfather‚Äôs oil-royalty in Australia. It has been my grandfather‚Äôs generosity that has allowed me to share my passions and good fortune with others.\\" January 23, 2012 from the Weeks Royalty, derived from his grandfather Lewis George Weeks' work, provide Weeks with the funds, capital, and resources to pursue the preservation of historic aircraft. Life and career The Weeks family moved to Miami, Florida when Weeks was 14, and he began flying model aircraft and competing on the high school gymnastics team. At 17, with only model airplane flying experience, he began building his own home-built Der Jager D-IX (a biplane powered by a four-cylinder Lycoming O-320 engine). During his final year of high school Weeks spent almost all his spare time building his airplane; he finished it in about four years, and test flew it at age 21. Weeks later learned to fly. He eventually purchased a Pitts S-2A in order to fly in aerobatic competition. In 1973 Weeks began entering aerobatic flying competitions while pursuing an aeronautical engineering degree at Miami-Dade Junior College, the University of Florida, and Purdue University. By 1977 Weeks had built the \\"Weeks Special,\\" an aerobatic aircraft of his own design, and qualified for the United States Aerobatics Team. In 1978 he was a runner-up among 61 competitors worldwide, earning three Silver medals and one Bronze medal in the FAI World Aerobatic Championships staged in Czechoslovakia. Over the span of a dozen years, he placed in the top three in the world five times and won a total of 20 medals in World Aerobatics Championship competition. He has twice won the United States National Aerobatics Championship and has won several Invitational Masters Championships in worldwide competitions. During the late 1970s, Weeks began to acquire, restore, and preserve vintage aircraft. By 1985 he had accumulated enough vintage aircraft to start the Weeks Air Museum in Miami. A non-profit facility, it housed much of his private collection and historic aircraft owned by the museum. Weeks then acquired a 250-acre site near Polk City, Florida, 20 miles southwest of Walt Disney World, for an aviation-themed attraction called Fantasy of Flight. In 1992, as development plans finalized for Fantasy of Flight, Hurricane Andrew struck the Miami area, virtually destroying the Weeks Air Museum facility and seriously damaging most of the vintage aircraft within it. Some of the collection, including a Grumman F4F Wildcat, P-51C Mustang, AT-6 Texan, and a recently repaired Stinson L-1 Vigilant, have been restored and are now displayed and flown at Fantasy of Flight, which opened in 1995. On May 26, 2000, Weeks married Teresa Blazina in Sedona, Arizona. In 2008 Weeks published a children's book, All of Life Is a School, featuring airplane characters. In 2009 he won a bronze Independent Publisher Book Award for the book. He followed it up with \\"The Spirit of Lindy\\" in September 2012. In 2012 Weeks was awarded the Lloyd P. Nolen Lifetime Achievement in Aviation Award by the Wings Over Houston Airshow. In 2010 he won the Freedom of Flight Award by Bob Hoover. In 2008 Weeks was inducted into the Florida Aviation Hall of Fame, and in 2006 was named a \\"Living Legend of Aviation.\\" In 2017 Weeks started producing and selling 'Naked in Jamaica', a Jamaican styled Rum, and retailing blackberries grown at his property in Florida. Aircraft collection Weeks at Fantasy of Flight in 2013 Weeks maintains one of the largest private collections of flight-worthy historic aircraft in the world, most of which are at his Fantasy of Flight facility in Polk City, Florida. The collection contains over 140 civilian and military planes including rare originals as well as reproductions of historic aircraft, such as the Spirit of St. Louis.1927 Spirit of St. Louis, fantasyofflight.com Another famous replica in Weeks' collection is the iconic Gee Bee Model Z, a racing plane originally built in 1931 and destroyed the same year during a world speed record attempt. It was involved in the opening scene of the 1991 film The Rocketeer. Weeks owns one of the four remaining original P-51C Mustangs in the world, with an estimated worth of over US$3 million. In addition, Weeks also owns a P-51D Mustang which came later in the war. Both use the Packard-Merlin V-12 engine of Rolls Royce design. Both the P-51C and P-51D frequently fly together, most notably during the event dubbed Mustangs and Mustangs which takes place every April where the P-51s and a number of antique Ford Mustangs are exhibited side by side. Weeks is rebuilding an Allison powered Mustang P-51A. Other original aircraft in the collection include a Short Sunderland flying boat. One of the seven Sunderland aircraft in existence, it is the only one that is reported to be maintained in airworthy condition, as well as the only airworthy 4 engine passenger flying boat. Weeks purchased the Sunderland in England in February 1993 and after a five-month restoration it was flown to the U.S, making stops in Ireland, Iceland, and Canada before arriving at the 1993 EAA AirVenture Oshkosh event. Following the show it was flown to Fantasy of Flight and regularly flew for the following years. However, since 1996 it has remained in the display hangar. It is still in good condition, and Weeks has expressed interest in flying the Sunderland again. During a 2020 Youtube video interview,Weeks stated the flying boat will be returned to the water and air following a complete renovation of the museum in the near future. Also on display is one of six existing Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers from WWII. This aircraft was acquired in the mid-1990s and flown to the museum shortly afterward, and it has remained the only airworthy B-26 since the 1995 crash of the Commemorative Air Force's example that occurred in Midland, Texas. Like the Sunderland, this aircraft has not flown since the late 1990s or possibly the early 2000s. It is unclear when the aircraft will fly again. Among the Collection is also a Curtis P-40 Warhawk (TP-40N trainer variant). It is the only airworthy P-40 type airplane with dual seating and controls; it makes frequent appearances at surrounding air shows and has been featured in the films Death Race and Tora! Tora! Tora!. Weeks is also known to have owned the largest number of Grumman J2F Duck aircraft since the U.S Navy, having purchased four of the rare aircraft; two have since been sold while one is frequently flown by Weeks, including amphibious water landings. The 4th aircraft is currently under restoration at the museum and Weeks hopes to fly both JF2 Ducks side by side in the near future. A Ford Trimotor, an early civil transport aircraft used by commercial airlines in the 1930s is also part of the collection; it has been used in films including the 1930 TWA promotional film, Coast to Coast in 48 Hours, appearing on screen with Amelia Earhart, and the 1984 adventure film, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, in which the plane is shown being piloted by Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Weeks has recently purchased the iconic Sikorsky S-38 replica, Osa's Ark. This historical aircraft is the only S-38 that still flies and was featured in the 2004 film, The Aviator. Most of the aircraft are functional and able to be flown; Weeks has stated that every aircraft in his collection has been flown by him, is being flown currently, or will be flown in the future.

In organic chemistry, the term organocatalysis (a portmanteau of the terms \\"organic\\" and \\"catalyst\\") refers to a form of catalysis, whereby the rate of a chemical reaction is increased by an organic catalyst referred to as an \\"organocatalyst\\" consisting of carbon, hydrogen, sulfur and other nonmetal elements found in organic compounds.Special Issue: Because of their similarity in composition and description, they are often mistaken as a misnomer for enzymes due to their comparable effects on reaction rates and forms of catalysis involved. Organocatalysts which display secondary amine functionality can be described as performing either enamine catalysis (by forming catalytic quantities of an active enamine nucleophile) or iminium catalysis (by forming catalytic quantities of an activated iminium electrophile). This mechanism is typical for covalent organocatalysis. Covalent binding of substrate normally requires high catalyst loading (for proline-catalysis typically 20-30 mol%). Noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen-bonding facilitates low catalyst loadings (down to 0.001 mol%). Organocatalysis offers several advantages. There is no need for metal-based catalysis thus making a contribution to green chemistry. In this context, simple organic acids have been used as catalyst for the modification of cellulose in water on multi-ton scale.International Patent WO 2006068611 A1 20060629 \\" Direct Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Organic Acid and Amino Acid-Catalyzed Modification of Amines and Alcohols\\" Inventors: Armando C√≥rdova, Stockholm, Sweden; Jonas Hafr√©n, Stockholm, Sweden. When the organocatalyst is chiral an avenue is opened to asymmetric catalysis, for example the use of proline in aldol reactions is an example of chirality and green chemistry.Example 4 in U.S. Patent 3,975,440 August 17, 1976, Filed Dec. 9, 1970 Zoltan G. Hajos and David R. Parrish. Introduction Regular achiral organocatalysts are based on nitrogen such as piperidine used in the Knoevenagel condensation. DMAP used in esterfications and DABCO used in the Baylis-Hillman reaction. Thiazolium salts are employed in the Stetter reaction. These catalysts and reactions have a long history but current interest in organocatalysis is focused on asymmetric catalysis with chiral catalysts, called asymmetric organocatalysis or enantioselective organocatalysis. A pioneering reaction developed in the 1970s is called the Hajos‚ÄìParrish‚ÄìEder‚ÄìSauer‚ÄìWiechert reaction. Between 1968 and 1997, there were only a few reports of the use of small organic molecules as catalysts for asymmetric reactions (the Hajos‚ÄìParrish reaction probably being the most famous), but these chemical studies were viewed more as unique chemical reactions than as integral parts of a larger, interconnected field.\\"The advent and development of organocatalysis\\" David C. MacMillan, NATUREVol 455|18 September 2008|doi:10.1038/nature07367 :The original reaction In this reaction, naturally occurring chiral proline is the chiral catalyst in an Aldol reaction. The starting material is an achiral triketone and it requires just 3% of proline to obtain the reaction product, a ketol in 93% enantiomeric excess. This is the first example of an amino acid-catalyzed asymmetric aldol reaction.Z. G. Hajos, D. R. Parrish, German Patent DE 2102623 1971 The asymmetric synthesis of the Wieland-Miescher ketone (1985) is also based on proline and another early application was one of the transformations in the total synthesis of Erythromycin by Robert B. Woodward (1981). A mini-review digest article focuses on selected recent examples of total synthesis of natural and pharmaceutical products using organocatalytic reactions. Many chiral organocatalysts are an adaptation of chiral ligands (which together with a metal center also catalyze asymmetric reactions) and both concepts overlap to some degree. Organocatalyst classes Organocatalysts for asymmetric synthesis can be grouped in several classes: * Biomolecules: proline, phenylalanine. Secondary amines in general. The cinchona alkaloids, certain oligopeptides. * Synthetic catalysts derived from biomolecules. * Hydrogen bonding catalysts, including TADDOLS, derivatives of BINOL such as NOBIN, and organocatalysts based on thioureas * Triazolium salts as next- generation Stetter reaction catalysts Examples of asymmetric reactions involving organocatalysts are: * Asymmetric Diels-Alder reactions * Asymmetric Michael reactions * Asymmetric Mannich reactions * Shi epoxidation * Organocatalytic transfer hydrogenation Proline Proline catalysis has been reviewed. Imidazolidinone organocatalysis Imidazolidinone Catalysts Imidazolidinones are catalysts for many transformations such as asymmetric Diels-Alder reactions and Michael additions. Chiral catalysts induceasymmetric reactions, often with high enantioselectivities. This catalyst works by forming an iminium ion with carbonyl groups of Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated aldehydes (enals) and enones in a rapid chemical equilibrium. This iminium activation is similar to activation of carbonyl groups by a Lewis acid and both catalysts lower the substrate's LUMO: :Iminium ion activation The transient iminium intermediate is chiral which is transferred to the reaction product via chiral induction. The catalysts have been used in Diels-Alder reactions, Michael additions, Friedel-Crafts alkylations, transfer hydrogenations and epoxidations. One example is the asymmetric synthesis of the drug warfarin (in equilibrium with the hemiketal) in a Michael addition of 4-hydroxycoumarin and benzylideneacetone: :Asymmetric warfarin synthesis J√∏rgensen 2003 A recent exploit is the vinyl alkylation of crotonaldehyde with an organotrifluoroborate salt: :Asymmetric Vinyl Alkylation Lee 2007 For other examples of its use: see organocatalytic transfer hydrogenation and asymmetric Diels-Alder reactions. Thiourea organocatalysis A large group of organocatalysts incorporate the urea or the thiourea moiety. These catalytically effective (thio)urea derivatives termed (thio)urea organocatalysts provide explicit double hydrogen-bonding interactions to coordinate and activate H-bond accepting substrates.

Death occurs by carbon monoxide poisoning. Mechanism of action As the charcoal burns, the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO), produced by the incomplete combustion of carbon, gradually increases. CO concentrations of as little as one part per thousand can be fatal if inhaled over a period of two hours. History As a method of suicide it is mentioned by Eug√®ne Sue in The Wandering Jew (1844).\\"Father Arsene did cut his stick; that evening, he and his old wife suffocated themselves with charcoal.\\" Ch 3. The Carouse Full Text In July 1994, two students of Taipei First Girls' High School ended their lives by charcoal-burning in a hotel in Su'ao, Yilan with a note that did not state the reason clearly, even though that it was suspected in some mass media that they were a lesbian couple. In November 1998, a middle-aged woman in Hong Kong took her own life using this method inside her small, sealed bedroom. She had a chemical engineering background. Hong Kong was suffering from an economic depression at the time, and suicide in general was increasing. After the details of this suicide were highly publicised by local mass media, many others killed themselves in this way (an example of the Werther effect). Within two months, charcoal-burning had become the third major suicide killer in Hong Kong.Media coverage boosts 'charcoal burning' suicides ‚Äî 28 February 2003 ‚Äî New Scientist Charcoal-burning suicide accounted for 1.7% of Hong Kong suicides in 1998 and 10.1% in 1999. By 2001, it had surpassed hanging as the second most-common method of suicide in Hong Kong (second only to jumping), accounting for about 25% of all suicide deaths. The method has since spread to mainland China, Taiwan and Japan.Taking the easy way out?, South China Morning Post, 9 January 2005 Beginning in 2003, authorities in Japan have seen a series of group suicides, committed by strangers who met in suicide chat rooms online. Such a group will typically use sleeping pills and charcoal stoves in a van parked in a remote area. On 26 July 2006, 16-year-old Brazilian musician Vin√≠cius Gageiro Marques, known by his alias Yo√±lu, locked himself in his bathroom with two barbecue grills, and posted on a forum asking for help killing himself. While some people in the thread pleaded him to stop, others gave him the advice he wanted. A Canadian online friend of Marques's learned of the suicide attempt and called the Brazilian authorities. Although the police and paramedics were able to enter the apartment and clear the smoke, Marques was pronounced dead after multiple attempts at resuscitation. On 9 March 2007, Brad Delp, the lead singer of the American rock band Boston, killed himself using this method.https://www.guitarworld.com/news/brad-delp- details-emerge-about-his-tragic-suicide On 18 December 2017, Kim Jong-hyun, a member of the South Korean idol group SHINee, was found unconscious in a Gangnam residential hotel. He was later pronounced dead in the ICU. The police ultimately ruled his death a suicide through the earlier text messages sent to his sister, after the discovery of charcoal briquette remnants in a frying pan at the scene. On October 16, 2018, an ex-member of GNZ48, Du Yuwei ended her life at the age of 19 using this method.

Only one example was built, with GMD serial number A1813. The locomotive was essentially the GMDH-1 design but with only a single hood, a single engine and an end cab, mounted on a six-wheel chassis. The locomotive served as a demonstrator for GMD, bearing number #275, between 1960 and 1962, including a period in Egypt, but no sales resulted. The locomotive was sold in 1963 to McKinnon Industries of St. Catharines, Ontario as their plant switcher, #2128. After nearly 30 years of service, it was sold in 1992 to the South Simcoe Railway, a heritage museum railway, in Tottenham, Ontario, but in 1995 it was declared surplus to requirements by the railway's directors. After a fund-raising effort, the Southern Michigan Railroad Society purchased the locomotive in 1996, where it remains in operable condition .

In 1917 it was documented in a monograph by Franz Boas, who considered the language nearly extinct.Boas 1917 In the 1970s another investigator found two speakers around Pochutla who still remembered a few of the words recorded by Boas.Knab 1980 In the early 20th century, scholars disagreed as to the origin of the language within the Nahuan family. Most thought Pochutec was distinct from Nahuatl, and this was proven in 1978, when Campbell and Langacker gave new argumentsCampbell and Langacker 1978 from Boas' data. Their conclusion was quickly accepted.Canger 2000:385Canger 1988:42-44Lastra 1992:37Peralta Ram√≠rez 2005:4INALI (National Institute of Indigenous Languages, Mexico), 2008:63 Nahuan thus consists of Pochutec and \\"General Aztec\\", which consists of Nahuatl and Pipil. Bartholomew (1980) suggests that some of the divergent traits, for example last syllable stress, are due to influence from Chatino, an Oto-Manguean language. She argues that at the time of the 16th century Spanish conquest of Mexico the settlement of Pochutla did not fall under the Aztec Empire's domain, but instead was part of the Mixtec state centered at Tututepec. Thus, the Chatino linguistic influences stemmed from the trade and communication routes between Pochutla and Tututepec passing through Chatino territory. Dakin (1983) argues that the key correspondence sets used by Campbell and Langacker as evidence for the existence of a separate fifth vowel *√Ø evolving from pUA *u, their main basis for separating Pochutec from their \\"General Aztec\\", were actually later developments within Pochutec by which proto-Aztec *i and *e > o in closed syllables, and that the supposed contrast in final position in imperatives originally had had a following clitic.Canger 1980: 117. In a later article, Canger and Dakin (1985) identify a different, very systematic isogloss for the development of pUA *u that shows a basic split between Eastern Nahuatl dialects and the Central and Western periphery, including Pochutec, as exemplified in at least eight different cognate sets. This proposal is incompatible with Campbell and Langacker's proposal for the development of pUA *u.1985 Dakin thus classifies Pochutec as belonging to the Western branch of the Nahuan languages, rather than having split off from Nahuan before the basic East-West split. Morphology Pochutec is an agglutinative language, where words use suffix complexes for a variety of purposes with several morphemes strung together.

Tilicho Lake is the destination of one of the most popular side hikes of the Annapurna Circuit trek. The hike takes additional 3‚Äì4 days. No camping is required, as new lodges have been built between Manang and the lake. The final approach to the lake is done in a day hike from the lodge at Tilicho Base Camp. Trekkers attempting the Annapurna Circuit route usually cross the watershed between Manang and Kali Gandaki valleys over the 5416 meters high Thorong La pass. The alternate route, skirting Tilicho Lake from the north, has been gaining popularity. This route is more demanding and requires at least one night of camping. There are no teahouses or lodges past the Tilicho Base Camp lodge some kilometers east of the lake and the next village of Thini Gaon in the Kali Gandaki valley. Most groups spend two nights between these places. There are two passes leading to Thini Gaon and Jomsom; Mesokanto La and Tilicho North pass known also as Tilicho \\"Tourist pass\\". These routes via Tilicho Lake are more often closed by snow than the higher Thorong La. Tilicho Lake was the site of one of the highest ever altitude scuba dives. A Russian diving team, consisting of Andrei Andryushin, Denis Bakin, and Maxim Gresko, conducted a scuba dive in the lake in 2000.  Religious Significance  Hindus believe that Tilicho Lake is the ancient Kak Bhusundi Lake mentioned in the epic Ramayana. The sage Kak Bhusundi is believed to have first told the happenings of Ramayana to Garuda - king of birds, near this lake. The sage took the form of a crow while telling the story to Garuda. Crow translates to Kak in Sanskrit, hence the name Kak Bhusndi for the sage. Surrounding mountains The mountains surrounding the lake are Khangsar, Muktinath peak, Nilgiri, and Tilicho.

He plays for the Leicester Riders and is the Captain of the Great Britain national team. High school career The only child of Eunice Sullivan, Andrew moved from his London home to the United States in 1996 where he attended St. Augustine Preparatory School, in Richland, New Jersey. In his prep career he scored 1,368 points, averaging 19.8 PPG as a senior. Coached by Paul Rodio his team had a 24-6 record and he was named in the first team all- state as well as being voted as South Jersey Player of the Year 1999. College career In 1999, Andrew enrolled in the School of Arts & Sciences at Villanova University, home of the Wildcats basketball team, from where he graduated in 2003. The gifted athlete was Villanova‚Äôs most versatile defender and could guard four positions. The point forward (he has played both point guard but more predominantly power forward) is able to run the floor well and his long arms and quick feet make him a strong rebounder. Sullivan took to his first season with the Wildcats in 1999-2000, on his debut chipping in with three rebounds and tough defense in seven minutes against Lafayette, and later the freshman converted his first career points with a 3-point shot from the top of the key in the first half against Fairleigh Dickinson. He tied a career high with seven points in 12 minutes in 67-66 loss to Miami on 17 January 2000 and three days later grabbed five rebounds and scored five points in 66-57 win at Providence. Overall it was a successful rookie season for the Englishman, in which another highlight unfolded when he made several spectacular plays in 86-69 win over Notre Dame, ending the night with seven points and five rebounds in 14 minutes of activity. By the end of the season, Sullivan had played 29 games, averaging 2.31 PPG. His second season saw his minutes fluctuate throughout the campaign, playing just 20 games and averaging a mere 1.65 PPG, although he did earn a career-high 26 minutes, playing with energy and strong defense in an 87-75 win over Towson University on 26 November 2000 he contributed four points and five rebounds. Returning from injury, Andrew also scored another four points in 23 minutes of activity in 74-60 win over Connecticut on 10 February 2001. The following season would prove to be much more successful than the previous when he established himself as Villanova‚Äôs best perimeter defensive player in 2001-02. He was the only Wildcat to start all 32 contests and connected on .529 of his field goal attempts, chalking up a 5.65 PPG average, or a combined total of 181 points throughout the season. Sullivan started the season well, when he contributed six points and six rebounds in 59-57 win over Dayton on 24 November 2001. His key steal on Dayton‚Äôs last offensive possession gave the Wildcats a chance to win on a final trip down the floor and his 28 minutes established a new career high as did his point total. Three days later Andrew better his minutes record, logging a career high 39 minutes in a 61-58 overtime loss against La Salle University. Later that season Andrew came within a whisker of his first career double-double, with nine points and nine rebounds in a 71-59 loss at University of Pittsburgh on 2 February 2002 and a week later helped hold Jason Kapono to nine points on 3-of-9 shooting in 58-57 Villanova victory over UCLA. Sullivan's season finished in a 72-70 loss to Connecticut in Big East Tournament on 7 March 2002 where he produced nine rebounds and four points. Professional career After leaving Villanova in 2003, Sullivan travelled to the Netherlands to sign a professional contract with leading Dutch club EiffelTowers from the city of Nijmegen. After just one season in the Netherlands, Andrew returned to his homeland and immediately signed for leading British Basketball League team the Newcastle Eagles in 2004. Despite being pipped to the league title by just two points, \\"Sulli's\\" season was incredibly successful. Not only did he help his team win the Championship Play-offs in a 78-75 win over the Chester Jets, but he was also the game high scorer with 27 points and was named as the MVP of the Championship. Following an incredible debut season in England, the future was looking bright for the British talent, and despite receiving several offers to play on the European continent, Andrew opted to stay with the Eagles for another season, resigning for 2005-06, and it paid handsomely. The Newcastle Eagles dominated the regular season, and conquered every tournament they participated in. First claiming the BBL Trophy with a 71-50 win over the Leicester Riders, Sullivan himself contributing with a game high 18 points, as well as 11 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals, which earned him the MVP award. The Eagles doubled their success with an 83-69 victory in the final of the BBL Cup against London Towers, with another 18 points, and also 2 blocked shots coming from the power forward. After capturing the League title, Newcastle then went on to win the Championship Play-Offs to complete the \\"clean sweep\\" of trophies. Sullivan scored 19 points in the final, an 83-68 win against the Scottish Rocks at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. To complete his victorious season, Andrew was also named as the BBL Player of the Year 2006. With every title won in just two years in England, seemingly Sullivan's work there was done and a fresh challenge was sought after. Europe came calling again and this time, he jumped at the chance of playing with European basketball's elite in the Euroleague. In the summer of 2006, he signed for Spanish ACB club Joventut Badalona, where he joined fellow Brits Robert Archibald and Andy Betts. After a season struggling with minutes and court time in Spain, and following the departure of his British teammates, Sullivan moved to Belgium to sign for Dexia Mons-Hainaut, who is coached by Great Britain coach Chris Finch. In September 2008 it was announced that Sullivan would once again represent the Newcastle Eagles after signing a two-month contract with the Eagles while waiting for the right offer from a European outfit. He quickly moved on to CSK VVS Samara of the Russian basketball league where he also played in the EuroChallenge. In November 2009 Sullivan played for Pizza Express Primetel Apollon in the first division of Cyprus. In January 2010 Sullivan moved back to the Newcastle Eagles and has helped win the BBL Cup and the League Title. In summer 2010 he signed for Mersey Tigers. In October 2011 Sullivan quit Mersey Tigers following a dispute regarding pay. A week later, he signed with Leicester Riders on a week-to-week contract. and then on 1 December 2011 he signed to the riders for the rest of the season. Sullivan remained at Riders for three successful years and was part of the 2013 treble winning team, claiming the BBL Championship regular season and Play-off crown's as well as winning the BBL Cup. In August 2014, after weeks of speculation, Sullivan was signed by his hometown team London Lions for the 2014‚Äì15 season. At the official unveiling, Sullivan claimed it was intention to see out the remainder of his career at the Lions. International career   England  Sullivan's successes have not just been restricted to his club teams, but continued with the England national team competing at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. An 80-58 victory against Nigeria in the third place game, in which Sullivan did not play, awarded England the Bronze medal and the team returned home triumphant. In the four games that he did feature, Sullivan averaged 31 minutes-per-game, 5 rebounds-per-game and 18.25 points-per-game, with his tournament high coming against South Africa where he scored 23 points in a 95-53 win.  Great Britain  More recently, Andrew has featured in the newly founded Great Britain national team who competed in Eurobasket 2009 and whose aim is to push for a medal at the London 2012 Olympic games. One of only two players, along with Nate Reinking, to remain from the inception of the Great Britain programme in 2006, Andrew has been the GB team‚Äôs captain in recent years. He starred in GB‚Äôs successful promotion campaign out of Division B in 2006-7 when he averaged 10.6 ppg. However, he has been a stalwart presence ever since and enters 2012 as the country‚Äôs second most capped player (behind Reinking).

There has been a long history of women in the field, but they have tended to be under-represented. In the era before the eighteenth century, science and geological science had not been as formalized as they would become later. Hence early geologists tended to be informal observers and collectors, whether they were male or female. Notable examples of this period include Hildegard of Bingen who wrote works concerning stones and Barbara Uthmann who supervised her husband's mining operations after his death. Mrs. Uthmann was also a relative of Georg Agricola. In addition to these names varied aristocratic women had scientific collections of rocks or minerals. In the nineteenth century a new professional class of geologists emerged that included women. In this period the British tended to have far more women of significance to geology. In 1977 the Association for Women Geoscientists was formed to support women in this field as they remained under-represented. There have been advances since then although retention remains a problem.

History The Institute of Medicine (IOM), established in 1972 at Tribhuvan University, was entrusted with the responsibility of training health care workers at all levels for the health care needs of Nepal. Within the first decade of its establishment, the IOM developed 12 campuses scattered over the country: three campuses in Kathmandu and nine outside the Kathmandu Valley. Initially, the emphasis of IOM was on the training of middle-level health workers. Programmes serving this purpose include ANM, CMA, Proficiency Certificate Course in General Medicine, Pharmacy, Radiology, Physiotherapy, Nursing, Health Laboratory and Traditional Medicine. The institutional goals of IOM have continued to change. The mission of the IOM expanded into training tertiary-level health professionals. By 1977 it had at the graduate level two-year Bachelor programmes in Community Nursing, Paediatric Nursing and Adult Nursing. In 1978, a community-oriented integrated MBBS programme was started with intake of 22 students. Subsequently, the class size was increased to 60, and in 2013 it was further increased to 76. In a groundbreaking moment for the institute, Professor Prakash Sayami was appointed as the new dean of the Institute, prompted by a second fast-unto-death by Professor Govinda K.C. This brought a change to the system of appointment of the officials on the basis of political affiliations and promulgated the system of seniority in the Institute. Mounting pressure from the Tribhuvan University officials on political appointments and provision of affiliations to resource-poor hospitals led to the resignation of Professor Prakash Saymi. He was succeeded by political appointee Prof. Sashi Sharma. Sharma is alleged to be involved in embezzlement of large amounts of money during his term as the vice-president of Nepal Medical Council and was subjected to investigations by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA). In reaction, Professor Govinda KC, the philanthropist orthopedic surgeon, announced a fast unto death in January 2014. IOM offers 45 scholarship seats in MBBS every year.  Hospital  Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, a 300-bed facility, was completed in 1984 with support from JICA. Another 100 beds were added in 1993. Currently at 663 beds, Tribhuvan University Hospital is the largest hospital in country, providing new tertiary-level health service. This hospital is the site of teaching and research activities of IOM.  B. P. Koirala Lions Center for Ophthalmic Studies  B. P. Koirala Lions Center for Ophthalmic Studies (BPKLCOS), a collaborative project of Tribhuvan University Institute of Medicine, B.P. Eye Foundation and Lions Club International District 325, is an important landmark in the history of blindness prevention in Nepal. Established with funds partially provided by Lions Club International Sight First Program and co- financed by Lions Club International Multiple District 102 Switzerland and Liechtenstein, this center has provided its services to about 82,000 eye patients in the last two years of its establishment. The center provides services at its premises and at satellite clinics and eye camps in the far- flung areas of the country. BPKLCOS is where MD Ophthalmology resident doctors and B. Optometry students have their clinical rotations and other academic activities.  New buildings  Four other centers have started functioning since early 2009: *Ganesh Man Singh Center for Ear, Nose, Throat, Head and Neck Surgery: The out-patient department is functioning fully. In-patient and operative procedures are carried out in the old building of the main Teaching Hospital Complex. *Manamohan Cardiovascular and Transplant Center is fully functioning with its own sets of faculty and medical officers. *Gynaecology and Obstetrics Centre: under-construction. *Paediatric Center is fully functioning. The New Emergency Building was recently inaugurated by honorable president of Nepal, Dr. Ram Baran Yadav. It was built by the owner of Bhatbhateni Super market in the memory of his parents. It is fully functional and equipped with labs and imaging facilities for dealing with critical situations round the clock. Patients are triaged into red, yellow and green zones. Those who need minimal observation are placed in the observation ward. A new rule was enforced by incoming director of the hospital in restricting referrals to other hospitals as long as beds are available in the hospital.

Today the IOM has 29 programs, from proficiency certificate level to the highest postgraduate degree in medicine, public health, paramedical, nursing and traditional Ayurveda medicine through Tribhuvan University Hospital and nine campuses around the country.  Optometry  There are no independent optometry colleges in Nepal. In 1997, Bachelor of Optometry was introduced in IOM initially as a three-year course. In 2003, the course was revised to a four-year course to meet international standards. National Health Profession Council (NHPC) with the recommendations of Nepalese Association of Optometrists (NAO) is the regulating body of optometrists in Nepal as there is no separate optometry council. However, like in other countries, recognition of optometrists (recently recognized as 'Doctors of Optometry' by the NAO as in US, Australia, Philippines etc.), is increasing and their vital role in eye care is being realized. Optometry in IOM is under Department of Ophthalmology. It is a unique place in the world where optometrists are trained with the MD Ophthalmology residents by the ophthalmology and optometry faculties.  Faculty of Nursing  In 1972, with the introduction of the New Education System Plan, nursing education became the responsibility of the Institute of Medicine (IoM), Tribhuvan University. The first nursing school became an IoM campus and the second one, an extension campus. These campuses ran a three-year nursing certificate programme that remained very oriented to hospital nursing, though the curriculum continued to prepare nurses for hospital services. In 1987, following a major review process which extended over several years, a new primary health-care oriented curriculum was introduced. This curriculum intends to meet the health-care needs of the people of Nepal. Therefore, the aim is to produce graduates who have the knowledge, understanding and skills to provide preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative aspects of care, to individuals, families and community. The existing two-track post basic BN program was started in 1968. The decision to start the revised program was based on having one nursing program at the Bachelor level with two tracks/community nursing and hospital nursing. Having two tracks with students taking a common course in areas of teaching, leadership management and research helped to prepare nurses to be flexible and adapt to any area of practice. Since the introduction of the first post-basic program, 404 nurse have graduated. The recent development in nursing education is a program leading to a master's degree in nursing (MN). The result of a study conducted in 1991 to determine the need for and the feasibility of introducing an MN program, indicated that with the expansion of health services, there would be a need for more nursing positions requiring higher level qualifications. The study results also indicated that with the expansion of health services, there would be a need for more nursing positions requiring higher level qualifications. The study results also indicated that 90 percent of the BN graduates surveyed were interested in undertaking study at the master's degree level in Nepal. The curriculum for the MN program was developed and plans were implemented in April, 1995. The most recent program in Nursing is B.Sc Nursing which was started in 2005 AD with 20 students. The program was focused in meeting the international standard of four years bachelor's degree and provide the nation with high skilled manpower in the field of nursing.  Faculty of Ayurveda  Institute of Medicine (IOM) provides Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) through Ayurveda Campus, Kritipur. Ayurveda Campus, Kritipur admits thirty students (top 15 gets full scholarship) in Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) every year into its 5¬Ω-year course with three professionals of 18 months each, followed by an internship of one year. Ayurveda Campus is the only centre for Ayurvedic education in Nepal. It resulted from the merging of HMG's Ayurveda Vidhyalaya and Chikitsalaya with the Institute of Medicine in 1972. History reveals that Rajakiya Ayurveda Vidhyalaya was the first to start technical education in the country in 1993 . Though striving for infrastructure since more than two decades, Bachelor and Certificate admissions were interrupted in 1991 and 1993 and was restarted in 1996.

It is affiliated with St. Patrick's Episcopal Church.  History  Founded in 1956 as a nursery school in a townhouse basement, the school has grown into a 500-plus student institution with separate elementary and middle school campuses in Washington D.C. Plans to construct a new high and middle school campus are underway.  School expansion  The school was founded by St. Patrick's Church as a parish nursery school in 1956. In 1966, the school began adding grades 1 through 6. In 1985 the church moved its chapel to the current site adjacent to the school. The school began a seventh and eighth grade program in 2001. Originally small and meeting in a portion of another school's property, the St. Patrick's middle school has grown to near-capacity. It is now housed in a large renovated house on MacArthur Boulevard. The campus boasts a beautiful library, along with two separate humanities rooms for grade 7 and 8. At the same time, middle school students attend their math, science, and stem classes at the other campus. In 2002, the school completed a major addition and renovation, which converted the outdoor \\"Play Court\\" into a three-story academic wing with six classrooms for grades 2 and 3 and a large library with floor-to-ceiling windows. The construction also involved the building of a new gym/stage across the street from the main building, the conversion of the old gym into an art studio, playroom, and conference room and the addition of a glassed-in foyer and reception area to the front of the school. In 2004, The Friends of Saint Patrick's Episcopal Day School, made the winning bid for the Casey Mansion property at 1801 Foxhall Road. This property had been offered to the District of Columbia as a possible site for a Mayor's Residence, but the District was unable to bring about the purchase.  Community relations  When the middle school campus was originally proposed, neighbors included then-ANC Chair Alma Gates, were concerned about the potential for disruption from a school housed in a house in a residential neighborhood. To accommodate the neighbors, several restrictions are in place: students are picked up and dropped off at the elementary campus. When the plans for the high school campus began, the school started working with the campus neighbors much earlier. The result of this greater outreach was passing through the first steps of the Zoning process with no neighborhood opposition.

Biography A scion of the Rurikid family descending from the princes of Smolensk, Mamonov was a prot√©g√© of Prince Potemkin, whose aide-de- camp he was appointed in 1784. Alexander did possibly have a twin brother, who, however, died shortly after birth due to mishandling in pregnancy.They were distant relatives. During the pinnacle of his power, Mamonov presented Potemkin with a gold teapot with the inscription: plus unis par le c≈ìur que par le sang. Two years later, Potemkin introduced the young man to the empress, hoping that he would \\"care for\\" the sovereign during his frequent absences from the capital. Catherine was charmed by Mamonov's good looks and manners and lavished expensive gifts on him, his relatives and friends. In a letter to Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, she praised his command of French, thus encouraging his literary pursuits. Within one year, he was promoted colonel, major general, and chamberlain. A suite of apartments was assigned to him in the Winter Palace. In 1787, the Empress asked her \\"redcoat\\"This was her pet name for Mamonov. to accompany her during a voyage to the Crimea, where he was present at her negotiations with Stanislaus II of Poland and Emperor Joseph II, who gave him the title of Reichsgraf. After two years spent with the Empress, Dmitriev-Mamonov started to lose interest in her. At the time of her sixtieth birthday, his mood was described as hypochondria. One of his friends reported that Mamonov \\"considers his life a prison, is very bored, and supposedly after every public gathering where ladies are present, the Empress attaches herself to him and is jealous\\". Soon enough he fell in love with a 16-year-old lady-in-waiting to the Empress, Princess Shcherbatova, and took her to spend several weeks in the privacy of Dubrovitsy, a luxurious estate near Moscow which Catherine had purchased from Potemkin and donated to Mamonov. When his enemiesMamonov was not on speaking terms with Bezborodko and at loggerheads with Catherine's intimate confidante, Anna Protasova. took advantage of the situation to inform Catherine about the liaison, the Empress was shocked and embittered. Unable to believe that a lover could betray her for a girl who could have been her granddaughter, she allegedly stooped to spreading rumors about his having gone mad. Count Dmitriev-Mamonov in 1802. Catherine's personal secretary recorded in his diary that he saw Mamonov and his fiancee on their knees asking and obtaining forgiveness of the sovereign.The diary belongs to Alexander Khrapovitsky, a friend of Mamonov and Derzhavin: \\"Tears... they spent the evening in bed... He has asked to resign.\\" Having received a wedding present of 100,000 roubles and 2,250 serfs, the newlyweds were commanded to leave the capital. They settled in Moscow. A year later, Mamonov started to regret the missed opportunities and wrote repentant letters to the Empress, claiming that their rupture \\"constantly tortures his soul.\\" Although he never received an answer,In a letter to Potemkin, Catherine commented: \\"There are signs that he had a desire to stay with his wife at court as before, finally a thousand contradictions and irrational behaviour, such that his closest friends do not justify him.\\" the Empress seems to have regarded him kindly until her death. There is no truth in the gossip that \\"Catherine revenged herself on the loose-tongued Shcherbatova by secretly sending policemen disguised as women to whip her in her husband's presence.\\"Alexander 222. She did, however, prevent Maria Shkurina, a maid of honor who she suspected of acting as a matchmaker for Shcherbatova, from rejoining the Mamonovs in Moscow.When she at last allowed Shkurina to abandon the court and join them in a m√©nage √† trois, Catherine quipped in a letter that \\"these two busy-bodies will kill him.\\" Count Matvey Dmitriev-Mamonov was his only son and heir.

It is about five kilometres from the city centre of Hobart. Rosny Park is the commercial twin of its residential namesake, Rosny. History The history of the area goes back to first settlement where the area was part of Kangaroo Point later renamed Bellerive. The area was rezoned splitting the areas of Bellerive and Rosny Park and gazetted as Rosny Park in 1977 and the boundaries re-gazetted in 1999. Rosny was named for a family name of W.A. Bethune, the holder of the original grant on the point, and he named it after his ancestor, the Duc de Maximilien de Bethune Sully, of Rosny-sur-Seine near Mantes in France. Retrieved 29 August 2014 Rosny Farm c.1818 is located within the Rosny Park boundary. The Rosny Barn was re-developed in 2006 to a multi-purpose, small capacity arts venue situated in the cultural hub of Hobart‚Äôs Eastern Shore. Rosny Cottage (now a Museum) and the School House Gallery (a replica of a schoolhouse that was built at Osterly in central Tasmania in 1890) are also located within the walls of the farm. Kangaroo Point Post Office opened on 24 June 1832. It was renamed Bellerive in 1882 and was closed and relocated to the Rosny Park office in 1982. Rosny Park has grown dramatically in the last half of the 20th century from being a small commercial precinct serving the nearby suburbs of Rosny, Montagu Bay, Warrane and Mornington to replacing nearby Bellerive as Clarence's primary commercial service district, or CBD. https://www.placenames.tas.gov.au Today Centred on Bligh Street and the Rosny Park Transit Mall, Rosny Park has effectively become the administrative, commercial and transportational centre of the City of Clarence, and therefore Hobart's eastern shore.

Throughout his life, his colleagues and the general public held McGilvary in great esteem, and businesses and government offices in Chiang Mai were officially closed in mourning on the day of his death.Herbert R. Swanson, with permission Biography McGilvary was born 16 May 1828, in North Carolina, United States and, after a largely informal education, taught school until he entered Princeton Theological Seminary in 1853. He graduated from Princeton in 1856 and returned to NC to pastor two rural churches. He was ordained in 1857. In 1858 he arrived in Thailand (then Siam) as a member of the Bangkok Station, Siam Mission, Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, and married Sophia Royce Bradley in 1860. In 1861, the McGilvarys participated in the opening of the Phet Buri Station, the first Protestant missionary station outside of Bangkok. In 1867, the McGilvary family moved to Chiang Mai, the chief city of Thailand's northern dependencies, and founded a new Presbyterian mission, the Laos Mission. The McGilvarys worked alone for one year and were chiefly responsible for the conversion of six men by early 1869. Persecution of these Christians in September 1869 led to the execution of two, the scattering of the others, and the threatened closure of the Laos Mission. McGilvary's perseverance, however, prevented the lapse of Protestant work in Northern Thailand. From 1870 until roughly 1890 McGilvary was the unofficial leader of the Laos Mission and took the leading hand in expanding its work including establishing several rural Christian communities which became important Christian centers. In 1878 he played a leading role in obtaining the so-called \\"Proclamation of Religious Toleration\\" from the Thai central government, which gave certain civil rights to northern Thai converts. Chiang Rai Witthayakhom, the school founded by Daniel McGilvary. Oldest building in the compound McGilvary took a number of exploratory tours, beginning in the 1870s, going as far as the Shan States in Burma and Yunnan Province in Southern China in the 1890s. Those tours inspired the Laos Mission with the vision of a greater mission to the Tai peoples of China and French Indochina, a vision which dominated mission work until the 1920s. McGilvary supported theological training for northern Thai evangelists and pastors. He took a leading role in promoting central Thai literacy among the northern Thai and he played an important role in promoting mission school education, particularly female education. In 1878, McGilvary established Dara Academy (at that time named as American Presbyterian Girls' School) in Chiangmai Province, the Oldest school in Northern of Siam (now Thailand). In 1888 McGilvary established a school in Chiang Saen District, Chiang Rai Province, that was moved to Chiang Rai city and eventually became Chiang Rai Witthayakhom School. McGilvary is also credited with introducing Western medicine into Northern Siam.

Although Ystrad Tywi was never a kingdom itself, it was historically a valuable territory and was fought over by the various kings of Dyfed, Deheubarth, Seisyllwg, Gwynedd, Morgannwg and the Normans. History At the start of the 8th century Ystrad Tywi was part of the kingdom of Dyfed. Around the year 730 Seisyll ap Clydog, king of Ceredigion, captured Ystrad Tywi from Rhain ap Cadwgan, king of Dyfed, and annexed it to his own kingdom. The name Seisyllwg was given to the new enlarged kingdom. As a result, Brycheiniog was once again detached from Dyfed; Ystrad Tywi had previously joined the two. In an attempt to regain the lands previously held by his father Rhodri Mawr, in 894 king Anarawd ap Rhodri of Gwynedd‚Äîtogether with an English force from his ally Alfred the Great‚Äîlaid waste to Ystrad Tywi and Ceredigion. In 920 Hywel Dda united Seisyllwg and Dyfed to create the kingdom of the Deheubarth. In medieval times Ystrad Tywi was divided into three cantrefi: Cantref Mawr on the north bank; Cantref Bychan and Cantref Eginawc on the south bank of the river. Eginawc (comprising the commotes of G≈µyr, Carnywyllawn, and Kidwelly) was lost to the Normans in the 11th century, and for the rest of the Middle Ages only the other two cantrefi formed Ystrad Tywi. Ystrad Tywi was transformed into the county of Carmarthen when Edward I enacted the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 following the success of his war against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales. Though G≈µyr had by now become part of Glamorgan, the rest of Eginawc was later restored to Ystrad Tywi, which was joined with Gwarthaf (except Efelfre) to form the modern county of Carmarthenshire. In legend In the first branch of the Four Branches of the Mabinogi, the tale Pwyll Pendefig Dyfed is told of the son of Pwyll, Pryderi, following his father on the throne of Dyfed and adding the three cantrefi of Ystrad Tywi and the four cantrefi of Ceredigion to his kingdom.

Great Chancellor Costache Conachi, father in law of Nicolae. His wife was Smaranda Negri-Donici. Prince Nicolae Vogoride (Romanian version; Bulgarian: –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞ or –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–π –ë–æ–≥–æ—Ä–∏–¥–∏, Nikola or Nikolay Bogoridi; Greek: ŒùŒπŒ∫œåŒªŒ±ŒøœÇ ŒíŒøŒ≥ŒøœÅŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÇ, Nikolaos Vogoridis; ), (1820, Ia»ôi, Moldavia ‚Äì 12 April 1863, Bucharest, Romanian United Principalities) was a caimacam (temporary replacement of Prince; from ) who ruled Moldavia between 1857‚Äì1858, following the Crimean War. Biography He was the son of Stefan Bogoridi, an Ottoman high official of Bulgarian ethnicity who also served as Moldavia's governor in 1820‚Äì1821, and brother of Alexander Bogoridi. His mother was Ralou Skilitzi. In 1856, as Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica was removed by the Treaty of Paris, although Moldavia remained technically under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire, Vogoride was appointed as finance minister under the new government of caimacam Teodor Bal≈ü. When Bal≈ü died on March 1, 1857, Vogoride replaced him. He showed himself to be an ultra-conservative, and was against the union of Moldavia with Wallachia, the other Danubian Principality -- the union project was advanced by the Romanian liberals who had taken part in the 1848 Moldavian revolution and, returning from exile, were organizing themselves as Partida Na≈£ionalƒÉ. The Treaty of Paris also required elections for the Moldavian Assembly, to be supervised by the Ottoman ambassadors of the signing parties. When these were held on July 19 of that year, Vogoride rigged the election lists to ensure a conservative majority with a strong Ottoman bias. When Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I, with the assurances of Imperial Austria, did not void the election, Moldavia's other overseers (French Empire, Imperial Russia, Prussia and the Kingdom of Sardinia) broke diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire on August 4; by August 9, a compromise had been reached, the first election was annulled, and a new one was held on September 22. Not unsurprisingly, the majority of those elected were in favor of the union of the two principalities. Vogoride was removed from office in October 1858. Personal life Vogoride studied in the Greek Orthodox College in Constantinople and later married into the wealthy Conachi family (1846), and sometimes thereafter used the name Nicolae Conachi-Vogoride. His wife was Princess Ecaterina Conachi, and they had four children: Prince Emanoil, Prince Constantin, Princess Maria and Princess Lucia.Vogoride. He died in Bucharest. His burial was in 1863 at BrƒÉila. One year later, his wife Princess Ecaterina married Emanuele Ruspoli, 1st Prince of Poggio Suasa.

Loosely based on the character of Jimmy Boyle, The Debt Collector explores themes of forgiveness, revenge, change and the macho culture of modern urban Scottish life. Plot The film opens in late 1970s Edinburgh; Nicky Dryden (Billy Connolly) is arrested by Gary Keltie (Ken Stott) for his part in enforcing the collection of money owed to a loan shark. Soon the film moves into the present time. Dryden has left prison and changed his ways. He is now a feted sculptor married to journalist Val Dryden (Francesca Annis) displaying his first show. The show is interrupted by Keltie who is disgusted by Dryden's new-found respectability, and claims that he hasn't paid his debt to society. Dryden wishes to move on from his past crimes, but Keltie is determined not to let him forget his past. Val is disturbed when Dryden confesses to her that his \\"policy\\" (modus operandi) during his criminal days was to intimidate debtors by assaulting their close relatives. At the same time a young wannabe gangster Flipper (Iain Robertson) is obsessed by Dryden's dark past and wishes to emulate him. He takes part in low level crime, which escalates in a murder of a security guard at a swimming pool (played by Ford Kiernan). Keltie continues to harass Dryden and his family, including disrupting a family wedding. When Dryden's stepson is murdered and Keltie shows up at the funeral, Dryden seeks revenge. He contacts one of his old underworld colleagues who arranges for Flipper to attack Keltie. Flipper, however, imitates Dryden's \\"policy\\" by viciously attacking Keltie's elderly mother (played by Annette Crosbie). Flipper makes contact with Dryden and boasts about his crime to Dryden. Disgusted by the attack on an old woman, Dryden himself brutally attacks Flipper, killing him in the end. Extremely distraught over the attack upon his mother, Keltie breaks into Dryden's home to attack Dryden. Dryden is however at the Edinburgh Tattoo at the time, and Keltie instead takes his vengeance on Dryden by raping his wife. Keltie eventually meets up with Dryden, and in a fight outside Edinburgh Castle ends up being killed by Dryden. The film ends with Dryden being acquitted of the murder of Keltie, but he is a broken man, disabled by the attack, his marriage has broken up and he is once again estranged from polite society. Finally, Keltie's mother is placed in a nursing home to reflect on the loss she has endured. Filming locations Although predominantly set in Edinburgh, much of the film was filmed in Glasgow as part of the condition of the Glasgow Film Fund.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159401/locations and some shot in Edinburgh.(2014) \\"Edinburgh the film set\\", Film Edinburgh, Page 9 Cast Mickie Dryden - Billy Connolly Gary Keltie - Ken Stott Val Dryden - Francesca Annis Flipper - Iain Roberson Lana (Keltie's mother) - Annette Crosby Colquhoun - Alistair Galbraith Catriona - Shauna Macdonald Duncan - Sandy Nelson Janitor - Ford Kiernan Val's father - Jimmy Logan  Awards  The film won the FIPRESCI prize at the Troia Film Festival.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159401/awards  References  External links  * Category:1999 films Category:British films Category:Scottish films Category:Films set in Scotland Category:Films set in Edinburgh Category:Culture in Glasgow Category:Films shot in Edinburgh Category:Films produced by Graham Broadbent ","title":"The Debt Collector (1999 film)"},{"id":"8086390","text":"Aristolochia labiata, the mottled Dutchman's pipe or rooster flower, is an ornamental plant which is native to Brazil.

On its initial release, Select noted in their review that Oval \\"sound unlike any other combo\\" on 94 Diskont. The review went on to note that group have been described in desperation as techno and critiqued this reference stating \\"try dancing to the sort of erratic pulsing and hiccuping that comes over like the read-out from a dying alien's electrocardiograph\\". 94 Diskont was released as a companion piece to Oval's previous album, Systemisch. The album's centerpiece is \\"Do While,\\" a 24-minute track originally composed for the group's 8-channel, 128-speaker modular sound installation named Wohnton (translates into home tone) in a stereo mixdown. The installation was shown throughout Europe between 1994 and 1996 on various occasions, ranging from art exhibitions to techno raves. A radio edit of the song, \\"Do While ‚åòX\\", is also included on the album. The US pressing by Thrill Jockey adds two additional songs and, on vinyl, moves \\"Do While ‚åòX\\" up in the running order to appear directly after \\"Do While\\", instead of closing the album. Both US and international vinyl versions of the album came with a remix LP that contains remixes by Mouse on Mars, Scanner, Cristian Vogel, and Jim O'Rourke. Reviews and influence Dave Morrison of Select gave the album a four out of five rating, first mentioning the group's unorthodox method of obtaining the sounds on the album, then noting that \\"this out-on-a-limb approach wouldn't mean a thing if the results weren't so brilliant.\\" The Wire placed the album at number five on its 1995 of top albums of the year. Ben Tausig of AllMusic awarded the album five stars and stated, \\"94 Diskont is undoubtedly a standout in the field of electronically advanced, glitch-heavy music.\\" In a 2003 feature, the webzine Pitchfork placed 94 Diskont at number 47 on its list of the top 100 albums of the 1990s. Mark Richardson of Pitchfork declared, \\"Sounds appear as multi-layer holograms, with both sources and ghosted copies simultaneously vying for attention, a piece of sonic trickery used to create some of the most serene and aquatic music of the ‚Äô90s.\\" Richardson would later state in a 2016 piece that 94 Diskont \\"was the first sound of a new future\\". In 2016, Pitchfork named 94 Diskont the seventh best ambient album of all time.

The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells motor vehicles. United Kingdom British Leyland introduced the Austin Metro in October, a compact three-door hatchback which was sold alongside the Mini and was powered by the 1.0 and 1.3 petrol engines that were familiar in other BL products. The Metro took five years and cost hundreds of millions of pounds to develop and left BL without enough money for any more immediate all-new cars. So the nine-year-old Morris Marina was restyled to become the Morris Ital in July. The launch of the Metro saw cutbacks of BL's Mini and Allegro ranges, while more significantly the MG factory at Abingdon closed and production of the MG B and Midget finished after 19 years, as did the Canley plant in Coventry, a move which signalled the end for the Triumph Dolomite. Ford's Escort was moved onto front-wheel drive hatchback format with 3 or 5 doors after 13 years as a rear-wheel drive saloon in September as the MK3. As before, there was also an estate version available, initially as a 3-door model but a 5-door version would appear in 1983. The engine line-up featured Fords new CVH Engine in 1.3 and 1.6 form. The 1.1 Valencia OHV Engine from the Fiesta was also available. A performance version of the car called XR3 with a twin choke version of the 1.6 CVH Engine was Fords challenger to the VW Golf GTi. The new Escort won the European Car of the Year award for 1981. At the beginning of 1980, Vauxhall began sales of its all-new Astra front-wheel drive hatchback, saloon and estate which was launched in the UK before the end of 1979 as the German-built Opel Kadett. It replaced the Viva. UK production began in late 1981. France Peugeot unveiled the new 505, a rear-wheel drive range of saloons and estates which were designed as an eventual replacement for the long-running 504 and a competitor for the likes of the Ford Granada, Rover SD1 and Vauxhall Carlton. The Peugeot-owned Talbot marque (created on the company's acquisition of Chrysler Europe in 1979) has seen the launch of the Tagora, a large four-door saloon which is to be built in France in limited numbers and would go on sale in Spring 1981. The Alpine hatchback now also forms the basis of the Solara saloon. Production of the Renault 12 finished two years after the launch of its successor - the R18. The R12 had been on sale for 11 years, though Romanian production of the car continue under licence by Dacia until 2004. Italy Fiat introduced a new entry-level three-door hatchback - the Panda - as a more modern and practical alternative to the rear-engined 126 in February. It shared a 652cc two-cylinder engine with the 126, but this version of the Panda was only sold on the domestic market. Spanish customers were offered the SEAT Panda. UK sales began in May 1981. Lancia began exporting its new Delta range of five-door medium-sized hatchbacks, designed as direct competitors for the Volkswagen Golf and Ford Escort. Sales began in Italy at the end of 1979 and the ultra-modern Delta was voted European Car of the Year. For the Swedish market, there was a Saab model known as the 600. 1980 saw a relaunch of Lancia's Monte Carlo sports car, a year after it was withdrawn from production. The relaunched Monte Carlo sports a much improved braking system - with refinements being made in response to heavy criticism over safety issues - but few other significant changes. Spain Fiat withdrew its subsidisation of the SEAT marque, a venture between themselves and the Spanish government. Though production of SEAT's Fiat-based models continued, licensing reasons prevented them from using the same nameplates as the Italian models from which they were derived. Sweden The newly launched Saab 900 range of upmarket hatchbacks was joined by a smaller, entry-level model - the Saab 600 - which was a clone of the Lancia Delta and was only sold in Sweden and Norway. Germany Volkswagen updated the 30-year-old Transporter range to give it an entirely new bodyshell, but the air-cooled engines and rear-wheel drive chassis continued largely unchanged. The new range of vans and people carriers had an improved braking system and improved specification levels, with some models having power steering and air-conditioning. Volkswagen expanded its commercial vehicle range by launching the Caddy, a Golf-based range of compact vans and pickup trucks. Eastern Europe Lada facelifted its decade-old Fiat-based range of saloons and estates and renamed them \\"Riva\\". The car's technology remained unchanged, with power still coming from 1.2, 1.3, 1.5 and 1.6 petrol engines. However, the Riva did not arrive on markets including the United Kingdom until 1983, with the original Lada continuing on those markets until then. Japan A year after going on sale in its homeland, the latest generation of the Toyota Corolla went on sale in Europe. The traditional rear-wheel drive chassis and saloon bodystyle continued, as did the 1.3, 1.6 and 1.8 petrol engines. Toyota gave its rear- wheel drive supermini the Starlet, a major facelift which included square front headlights instead of round ones. The old 1.0, 1.2 and 1.3 power units were replaced by new 12-valve ones which gave more power and better economy. Honda introduced a new medium-sized family saloon - the Ballade - which gave traditionalists a viable alternative to the Civic hatchback. It will be imported to the USA as a Civic, but the British version will go into production next year as part of a venture with British Leyland. The Civic, Honda's best-selling model, was redesigned to exhibit a more aerodynamic shape and a more extensive range of trim levels. The 1.3 and 1.5 petrol engines are both new to the range, replacing the outdated 1.3 power unit from the original Civic range. Nissan bolstered its Datsun brand to give European buyers an alternative to the Ford Cortina. Its latest generation Bluebird comes in a range of saloons, estates and coupes. The coupe version comes in \\"SSS\\" form with a more powerful version of the already good 2.0 power unit. The standard 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0 petrol engines are carried over from the previous range, though the underpowered 1.4 unit has been discontinued. Mazda moved to front- wheel drive for its popular 323 hatchback, which will be sold in Australia as the Ford Meteor and Ford Laser as part of Mazda's venture with Ford. The latest 323 had 1.1, 1.3 and 1.5 petrol engines, and the car's contemporary body was designed with the help of Ford's design team. Production of the rear- wheel drive estate, part of the pre-1980 range continues.

Its membership of 21 schools supports the continuation of an American education in the Caribbean region and Colombia. The organization's focus is on school improvement, encouraging an ongoing program of staff development and teacher and student interactions. New members must be either US-accredited institutions or candidates for accreditation. History ACCAS was founded in 1961 by five directors of schools in Colombia: *David Bjork, Colegio Nueva Granada, Bogot√° *Dale Swall, Colegio Bolivar, Cali *Nancy Davidson, Columbus School, Medell√≠n *Walter Jarvis, Colegio Karl C. Parrish, Barranquilla *Helen Wallace, Colegio Jorge Washington, Cartagena At this stage of its history, the Caribbean region was not included in the Association. In 1963 Colegio Panamericana was founded in Bucaramanga and joined the Association soon thereafter. The early list of presidents of ACCAS includes: *1961 David Bjork, Colegio Nueva Granada, Bogot√° *1963 Raymond Mosley, Columbus School, Medell√≠n *1965 James Baker, Colegio Nueva Granada, Bogot√° *1967 Burton Fox, Colegio Karl C. Parrish, Barranquilla Principal activities in early days included student interchanges in athletics, speech and similar extra curricular programs, all within the boundaries of Colombia. Frequently inexpensive travel via Avianca Airlines was greatly beneficial in this period. In 1966 a contract was initiated with the University of Alabama, the Office of Overseas Schools and ACCAS. The objective was to deliver Masters and Doctorate degrees for faculty and administrators employed in the ACCAS schools. Over the next seven years a large number of M.A.‚Äôs and Ph.D.‚Äôs came out of this program. The signators to the agreement were: Dr. Ernest N. Mannino, Director, A/OS; Dr. Merlin Duncan, REO, A/OS; Dean Robert Bills, The University of Alabama; Dr. Burton Fox, V.P. for ACCAS. In 1967, A/OS requested Dr. Fox to visit the Priory School, Kingston, Jamaica; Union School, Port-au-Prince, Haiti; and the Carol Morgan School, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic and explore ways to include these three schools in regional activities. This and subsequent visits resulted in the Union School, (Director, Marie Bogat) and the Carol Morgan School (Director, Roscoe Crowell) joining the Association. The Priory School under Founder and Headmaster, Henry Fowler, joined the following year. At this time, the name of the Association was changed to the ASSOCIATION OF COLOMBIA- CARIBBEAN AMERICAN SCHOOLS. Soon afterward the first dues were charged: $25 per school per year.

It was also the tradition that Saint James (Santiago) had travelled to the Iberian Peninsula during his life and was buried there. The name is also complicated in Spanish in that Jaime and Jacobo are modern versions of James. Variants of Santiago include Iago (a common Galician language name), and Thiago or Tiago (a common Portuguese language name). The common name James has many forms in Iberia, including Xacobo or Xacobe (in Galician), Jaume, Xaume, Jaime, Jacobo, and Diego (in Spanish).

It was the band's first album for the label and their first with new drummer Ruby Mars. After the end of their major-label contract with Interscope Records in 1999 and the departure of longtime drummer Atom the following year, the band spent much of 2000 in search of a new label and drummer. Singer/guitarist John Reis experimented with several other drummers, resulting in the formations of Hot Snakes and Sultans, but did not find a suitable replacement for Willard. When Rocket from the Crypt signed to Vagrant Records later that year they recruited Superchunk drummer Jon Wurster to act as their studio drummer, and he played on a majority of the album's tracks. Partway through the recording process, however, the band discovered local San Diego drummer and professional skateboarder Mario Rubalcaba, who joined as their new full-time drummer under the stage name \\"Ruby Mars\\" and played on the remainder of the album. The addition of Rubalcaba gave the band renewed energy, and Group Sounds was released in 2001 to positive reviews. Some touring followed in support of the album, but band members were drifting into other projects (most notably Reis in Hot Snakes and Sultans) and Rocket became less the focus. Their next album, 2002's Live from Camp X-Ray, would prove to be their last.

Plot Joey auditions for a big movie role which requires him to appear naked. A problem arrives, however, when the part calls for an uncircumcised man. Monica helps Joey try to get the part by making replicas of things on the outside of the body using various meats and silly putty. Joey goes to his audition, which goes well until a part of the replica falls off, horrifying the director and casting director. Rachel and Phoebe plan Monica's bridal shower at the last minute. The two had completely forgotten until Monica reminds them, so are left to make quick decisions for a party within two days. Arbitrarily calling people from Monica's address book Phoebe takes from her purse results in a weird crowd neither of them knows and they both forget to invite the bride. When Monica arrives, she accidentally bad mouths the guests under the belief that they left before she arrived. Ross and Monica's cousin, Cassie, visits, and Chandler becomes attracted to her. As a result, she moves from Monica's to Ross' apartment. Unfortunately, Ross gets smitten by her looks as well. When he and Cassie are watching a movie together, Ross gets the impression that Cassie wants to have sex with him, so he reaches out to kiss her. Horrified, she storms out of the apartment. Cassie finally stays at Phoebe's, but she is smitten by her looks as well.

The Independent writer Cl√©mence Michallon ranked the episode #206 on their ranking of the 236 Friends episodes. CollegeHumor writer Willie Muse had a negative opinion on \\"The One with Ross and Monica's Cousin\\", due to him considering Ross' move on his cousin to be one of the worst things he ever did.

It first aired on May 17, 2001 as the finale of season seven. It is usually broadcast in a one-hour slot and presented on DVD as one complete episode, but when the episodes are split the two parts are differentiated by the suffixes Part 1 and Part 2. For his guest appearance, Gary Oldman was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.  Plot  Part One In the opening scene, after the others leave Central Perk for lunch with Monica and Ross's mother, Ross gives Chandler his \\"older brother\\" talk: if Chandler ever hurts Monica or ever causes her any unhappiness of any kind, Ross will hunt him down and beat him up. Chandler finds this funny and struggles to contain his laughter at this. Joey has started shooting a World War I movie with Richard Crosby (Gary Oldman) who keeps spitting while saying his lines which annoys Joey. When he cannot stand it anymore, he talks to Richard about it, when Richard tells him that all good actors spit while saying their lines. Therefore, when they shoot the next scene, Joey and Richard both constantly spit at each other while saying their lines. When their scenes are over for the day, Joey is given lines for scenes for the next day, which unfortunately conflicts with him performing Monica and Chandler's wedding that day. Back at Monica's apartment, Chandler and Monica are going to their wedding rehearsal. Chandler listens to the answering machine after Monica leaves and begins to freak out when he realizes they are becoming \\"The Bings\\". At the rehearsal things are going smoothly until Chandler's parents come and things go crazy. When Chandler's mom, Nora Tyler-Bing (played by Morgan Fairchild), is introduced to Monica's parents Jack and Judy Geller, Jack embarrasses himself by mistaking her for Chandler's dad. Chandler's mom and Chandler's dad, Charles Bing (played by Kathleen Turner), keep having arguments, and Ross bemuses everyone else by talking about his \\"big brother\\" talk with Chandler. After the dinner, Ross goes to Joey's apartment looking for Chandler who is staying the night since the groom cannot see the bride before the wedding, but finds an empty room and a note from Chandler. Ross immediately goes across the hall to Monica's apartment and shows Rachel and Phoebe the note Chandler left simply saying to tell Monica he is sorry. Understanding that Chandler has truly left and trying to figure out what to do, Ross goes out to search for Chandler while Rachel and Phoebe make sure Monica does not find out. The next morning, Ross informs Rachel and Phoebe that he still has not found Chandler. Monica is so excited and thrilled about her wedding day that starts getting ready. Seeing this, Rachel starts to panic and begins to cry. Phoebe takes her to the bathroom to prevent Monica from seeing her in this state otherwise she will know something is wrong. When they are in there, Phoebe finds a positive pregnancy test in the garbage and deduces that Monica is pregnant. Part Two Ross tells Rachel to stall Monica so he can have more time to search for Chandler and Phoebe helps him search. When Monica comes back out of her room to begin getting ready for the wedding, Rachel distracts her by moping about her own unlikelihood of getting married. Meanwhile, Ross and Phoebe find a confused Chandler in his office. He tells them he loves Monica so much, and he does not want to hurt her, but he is afraid that becoming \\"The Bings\\" will spell marital misery, maybe as bad as his parents. Ross convinces Chandler to go back to the apartment and begin getting ready, doing one thing at a time, not thinking about the goal. In Monica's apartment, Rachel tries other less believable tactics to distract Monica and she realizes that something is going on. Rachel decides to tell Monica, but Phoebe opens the door and gives a thumbs-up sign to Rachel, controlling the situation. At the studios, Joey pleads with the director to leave early for the wedding, but is informed he cannot change his schedule, but is promised that only a short scene needs to be done that day. However, after Joey meets Richard and sees that he is too drunk and can barely stay focused; he is stuck redoing the scene over and over. At the hotel, everything is ready for the wedding when Joey calls Rachel to warn her that he wll be late. Meanwhile, Ross is keeping an eye on Chandler since he still has cold feet. Chandler steps out to sneak a cigarette when he suddenly hears Phoebe and Rachel coming, so he ducks into a storeroom to hide. He overhears that Monica is pregnant and takes off again. Rachel finds another wedding finishing up in the same hotel and convinces the minister to officiate the wedding in case Joey does not arrive in time. Meanwhile, Joey again pleads to leave the studio early for the wedding, but the director makes it very clear to Joey that he cannot leave until the scene is finished or as long as Richard is on set and conscious. Upon greeting Richard at his dressing room, he convinces him that they have completed all of their scenes and carries him home. Ross and Phoebe find Chandler again and Ross rapidly tackles him to the ground urging him not to hurt Monica. Chandler admits that he was indeed running away until he found a small baby outfit in the hotel's gift store and began to come around to the idea of fatherhood. He then goes with Phoebe and Ross to the wedding. As the ceremony begins, Joey finally arrives and takes his place between Monica and Chandler, accidentally letting slip that Chandler had second thoughts about the wedding. Monica delivers her self-written vow, while Chandler delivers one from the heart ‚Äì both speeches are very moving. When the ceremony is over, Chandler tells Monica that he knows about her being pregnant and how Phoebe found a pregnancy test in the trash, but she reveals she did not take a pregnancy test; to which he wonders who did. Phoebe exclaims to Rachel how Chandler and Monica are now married and having a baby, and the camera zooms in on Rachel as she manages a weak \\"uh-huh\\" with a slightly panicked look on her face, thus revealing that she is the one who is pregnant. Production The show was filmed over two weeks, with all of the scenes featuring Gary Oldman being filmed in the first week. The wedding was filmed in the second week, with the final shot of Rachel filmed after the studio audience had left.DVD audio commentary Reception The first part has a 9.1 rating at TV.com with the second having a slightly higher 9.3.

Club career Early career Born in S√£o Jos√© do Rio Preto, S√£o Paulo, Gl√°uber began his footballing career with Belo Horizonte-based club Atl√©tico Mineiro before joining Palmeiras in S√£o Paulo, where he saw top- flight football for the first time in 2003. After an eighteen-month stint with the Verd√£o he was transferred in December 2005 to 1. FC N√ºrnberg on a six- month loan with a buying option for the Bundesliga club. Gl√°uber quickly became a starter for the team for the remainder of the season. Thus, N√ºrnberg exercised their right to acquire Gl√°uber in the summer of 2006. Shortly before the deal was finalized, his Italian ancestry helped him in acquiring Italian citizenship, which means he no longer counted against the team's contingent of non-UEFA-players. Manchester City On 31 August 2008, Gl√°uber signed a one-year deal with Premier League club Manchester City for an undisclosed fee. Even though he did not appear for the first team, the City fanbase referred to the substitutes bench sometimes as \\"The Berti\\" in his honour. On 24 May 2009, the last day of the 2008‚Äì09 season, he finally made his d√©but for Manchester City, at the City of Manchester Stadium. After being an unused substitute 20 times, he came on in the 84th minute for left back Wayne Bridge against Bolton Wanderers. He was cheered every time he touched the ball by Manchester City fans, got a mini-standing ovation when he took a throw-in and was voted Man of the Match on the BBC Sport Online website, with an average rating of 8.67 out of 10. Manager Mark Hughes commented after the match: \\"He got a really great reception! I've not been able to give him the opportunities that maybe I would have liked, but I thought that today was a chance to do that. It was important to do it not only for the fans but also for the squad, because they were all keen that he got an opportunity to get on the field in a sky blue shirt. I must be going soft in my old age!\\" He was released by Manchester City at the end of the season, having made just the single appearance. In 2011, Bleacher Report named him one of Manchester City's \\"Top 10 Cult Heroes of All Time\\" and in October 2015 Gl√°uber gave an interview, speaking fondly about his time at Man City. He said \\"That 10 minutes [of the game against Bolton] were wonderful because every time I touched the ball the fans shouted my name. It was a really nice thing. It became a bit funny because the more I wanted to play, the more the fans wanted to see me play... I gave my best all of my time there. Those who shared the dressing room with me know about my dedication in training and they know how much I fought for that opportunity. Unfortunately it came on the last day, but even so, it was still a wonderful time in my career at City because it helped me to grow as a person as well.\\" Later career In his third appearance with the Columbus Crew he scored his first goal for the team in the 68th minute during the home opener one 16 March 2013. On 13 June, he suffered a ruptured left anterior cruciate ligament in the 6th minute of a U.S. Open Cup match vs. Chicago Fire. He subsequently underwent arthroscopic knee surgery and was placed on the injured list for the remainder of the year. On 22 November 2013, Gl√°uber's contract option was declined by the Columbus Crew. He subsequently retired from football and returned to Brazil, where he runs his own business. International career Gl√°uber has been capped once for the Brazil national team, appearing in a friendly against Guatemala on 27 April 2005. Honours 1\\\\.

The method as used today was developed by the developmental psychologist Robert L. Fantz in the 1960s. The Preferential Looking Technique According to the American Psychological Association, the preferential looking technique is \\"an experimental method for assessing the perceptual capabilities of nonverbal individuals (e.g., human infants, nonhuman animals)\\". If the average infant looks longer at the second stimulus, this suggests that the infant can discriminate between the stimuli. This method has been used extensively in cognitive science and developmental psychology to assess the character of infant's perceptual systems, and, by extension, innate cognitive faculties. An investigator or examinor observes the infants behavior to determine which stimulus the infant fixates on. Robert L. Fantz Robert L. Fantz (1925-1981) was a developmental psychologist who launched several studies on infant perception including the preferential looking paradigm. Fantz introduced this paradigm in 1961 while working at the Case Western Reserve University. The preferential looking paradigm is used in studies of infants regarding cognitive development and categorization. Fantz's study showed that infants looked at patterned images longer than uniform images. He later built upon his study in 1964 to include habituation situations. These situations exhibited an infants preference for new or unusual stimuli. Summary of Findings Conclusions have been drawn from preferential looking experiments about the knowledge that infants possess. For example, if infants discriminate between rule-following and rule- violating stimuli‚Äîsay, by looking longer, on average, at the latter than the former‚Äîthen it has sometimes been concluded that infants know the rule. Here is an example: 100 infants are shown an object that appears to teleport, violating the rule that objects move in continuous paths. Another 100 similar infants are shown an object that behaves in a nearly identical manner to the object from group 1, except that this object does not teleport. If the former stimulus induces longer looking times than the latter, then, so the argument goes, infants expect that objects obey the continuity rule, and are surprised when they violate this rule. Some researchers have suggested, of some such experiments, that infants have innate knowledge of those rules the violation of which they can perceptually discriminate. Common criticisms of this innateness thesis include that the infant has already acquired enough experience of non-teleporting objects to justify its surprise, and that teleporting objects are attention-grabbing for reasons other than expectancy violation. Findings from preferential looking experiments have suggested that humans innately possess sets of beliefs about how objects interact (\\"folk physics\\" or \\"folk mechanics\\") and about how animate beings interact (\\"folk psychology\\"). The Preferential Looking Technique at Work Children's Gradient Sensitivity to Phonological Mismatch: Considering the Dynamics of Looking Behavior and Pupil Dilation This study collected data using a preferential looking paradigm. The paradigm was analyzing looking behavior and pupil dilation to track children's recognition to different degrees of mismatching labels and objects in a picture. It was found evidence that there is a sensitivity to phonological mismatch among children. The study also provided support for the thesis that early comprehension and knowledge of root words are solid enough to convert subphonemic detail to what they are not familiar with. Preferential looking experiments have been cited in support of hypotheses regarding a wide range of inborn cognitive capacities, including: * Depth perception * Face perception * Basic arithmetic (numeracy) Labs using preferential looking UIUC * http://www.psych.uiuc.edu/~cfisher/LALAB/Projects.html#syntax CWRU (Fantz, later Fagan et al) * http://blog.case.edu/case- news/2009/08/05/josephfaganmensa Studies employing preferential looking * See also * Cognitive science * Habituation References * ‚ÄúAPA Dictionary of Psychology.‚Äù American Psychological Association, American Psychological Association, dictionary.apa.org/preferential-looking-technique. * Sheehy, Noel; Chapman, Antony J.; Conroy, Wendy A.

Wolf Leslau (; born November 14, 1906 in Krzepice, Vistula Land, Poland; died November 18, 2006 in Fullerton, California) was a scholar of Semitic languages and one of the foremost authorities on Semitic languages of Ethiopia. Youth and education Leslau was born in Krzepice, a small town near Czƒôstochowa, Poland. When he was a child his family was very poor, and after contracting tuberculosis he usually had to keep a thermometer with him to monitor his body temperature, although the reasons for this are unknown. He was orphaned by the age of 10, and was raised by his brother, and received a yeshiva education. To avoid military service in the Polish army, he gave up his Polish citizenship (becoming a stateless person) and emigrated to Vienna, where he would engage in Semitic studies at the University of Vienna until 1931. He then went to the Sorbonne to study under Marcel Cohen. His studies included most of the Semitic languages, including Hebrew, Aramaic, Akkadian, Soqotri and Ethiopic. War years Leslau was arrested by the French police and sent to an internment camp in the Pyrenees where he spent the harsh winter of 1939-1940 with his wife and child. He was later moved to Camp des Milles, a concentration camp near Aix-en-Provence. However, with the assistance of an international aid group, he escaped with his family before the Nazis took over the camp in 1942. Escaping to the United States, he later became a naturalized U.S. citizen.Guthe, C. E. (1950). International directory of anthropologists. 3rd edition. Washington, D.C.: National research Council. page 108. He settled in New York City, and received a Guggenheim Fellowship to continue his studies of the Semitic languages in Ethiopia. He traveled throughout the country, recording endangered Ethiopian languages. For one language, Gafat, Leslau was able to locate only four speakers. It became extinct shortly thereafter. Career in the United States and fieldwork After teaching at the Asia Institute, the New School for Social Research, and for 4 years at Brandeis University, he joined the faculty of University of California, Los Angeles in 1955. He was instrumental in establishing the Department of Near Eastern Studies and the Center for Near East Studies. Ethiopia Leslau specialized in previously unrecorded and unstudied Semitic languages of Ethiopia. His first trip to Ethiopia in 1946 was funded by a Guggenheim fellowship. South Arabia and Yemen In 1950, Leslau traveled to South Arabia and Yemen. There he made field recordings at gatherings of South Arabian Bedouins and Yemenite Jews. In 1951, the recordings were issued by Folkways Records as Music of South Arabia in their \\"ethnic\\" series, FE-4221. The recordings, as well as Leslau's liner notes, are available for download from Smithsonian Folkways.https://folkways.si.edu/music-of-south- arabia/islamica-world/album/smithsonian Recognitions and retirement In 1965 Leslau received the Haile Selassie Prize for Ethiopian Studies in Addis Ababa from Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie. He held the position of Professor Emeritus at UCLA until his death at the age of 100. He remained active in research and writing until his death. He learned to use a Macintosh computer at the age of 80. Leslau died at a nursing home in Fullerton, California, in 2006.

Club career Born in Penafiel, Coelho reached FC Porto from northern neighbours F.C. Penafiel aged 18, and spent his first professional months with the reserve side, being loaned shortly after to F.C. Maia of the second division. He spent the next three seasons out on loan, to Standard Li√®ge, Portimonense SC, for which he played alongside namesake Nuno Miguel Coelho in the 2007‚Äì08 season also in the second level, and C.F. Estrela da Amadora. On 24 August 2008, Coelho made his Primeira Liga debut with C.F. Estrela da Amadora, playing 90 minutes in a 1‚Äì0 home win against Acad√©mica de Coimbra. In July 2009, he returned to Porto following the retirement of veteran Pedro Emanuel, appearing only once during the league campaign, the 4‚Äì1 victory at U.D. Leiria in the last matchday (adding four Ta√ßa da Liga games and the first half of the 0‚Äì5 away loss to Arsenal in the UEFA Champions League round of 16 second leg). On 4 July 2010, Coelho signed a four-year contract with Sporting CP for ‚Ç¨1million, as part of the deal that sent Jo√£o Moutinho in the opposite direction. The northerners retained 50% of the player's rights. His first official match came on 13 August in a 0‚Äì1 loss at F.C. Pa√ßos de Ferreira; on the 26th he scored a rare goal, shooting from 40 metres as the Lions defeated Br√∏ndby IF 3‚Äì0 after losing 0‚Äì2 at home, thus qualifying for the UEFA Europa League's group stage. After the end of 2010‚Äì11 ‚Äì where he was used sparingly, often not being selected for matches even when healthy ‚Äì on 7 June 2011, Coelho was sold to S.C. Braga as an installment deduction on the deals of Jo√£o Pereira and Evaldo Fabiano transfers, agreeing to a four-year deal. His three-year spell in Minho was marred by several injury problems. On 5 July 2014, Coelho joined Balƒ±kesirspor from Turkey for three seasons. On 26 January 2016, after several months without a club, he moved to the Major League Soccer with Sporting Kansas City, scoring from 30 yards in his debut in a 1‚Äì0 away win against the Seattle Sounders FC. International career During roughly two years, Coelho played for the Portugal under-21 team. On 29 August 2010 he was first called to the senior side, for two UEFA Euro 2012 qualifiers against Cyprus and Norway, but did not make his debut.

It is often a component of more complex analyses such as escape analysis. A closely related technique is shape analysis. (This is the most common colloquial use of the term. A secondary use has pointer analysis be the collective name for both points-to analysis, defined as above, and alias analysis. Points-to and alias analysis are closely related but not always equivalent problems.) Example For the following example program, a points-to analysis would compute that the points- to set of \`p\` is {\`x\`, \`y\`}. int x; int y; int* p = unknown() ? &x; : &y; Introduction Techniques range widely in performance and precision. For large programs, some tradeoffs may be necessary to make the analysis finish in reasonable time and space. Two examples of these tradeoffs are: *Treating all references from a structured object as being from the object as a whole. This is known as field insensitivity or structure insensitivity. *Ignoring flow of control when analysing which objects are assigned to pointers. This is known as context-insensitive pointer analysis (when ignoring the context in which function calls are made) or flow-insensitive pointer analysis (when ignoring the control flow within a procedure). The disadvantage of these simplifications is that the calculated set of objects pointed to may become less precise. Algorithms Pointer analysis algorithms are used to convert collected raw pointer usages (assignments of one pointer to another or assigning a pointer to point to another one) to a useful graph of what each pointer can point to . The two primary algorithms are Steensgaard's algorithm and Andersen's algorithm.

Urban services in Devonport are provided by a private operator, Merseylink Coaches. Services are provided by Metro under a range of urban and non-urban contracts with the Transport Commission, a division within the Department of State Growth. History Ansair bodied Scania N113CRB in December 2012The history of Metro Tasmania dates back to 1893, when the Hobart Electric Tramway Company (HETCo) was founded by a London consortium. The HETCo was one of the earliest such operators in the world, and was the first electric tramway in the Southern Hemisphere. The company also operated two Dennis motorbuses prior to being taken over in 1913 by the Hobart City Council, who renamed it to Hobart Municipal Tramways (HMT). In 1935, HMT began to use trolleybuses on some networks to replace trams, and petrol buses were introduced on some networks in the 1940s to alleviate congestion. In 1955, a statutory authority called the Metropolitan Transport Trust (MTT) was formed, and this entity amalgamated the operations of the Hobart Municipal Tramways and Launceston Municipal Transport, which had been operated by the Launceston City Council as Launceston Municipal Tramways between 1911 and 1953 (when 'Tramways' was replaced by 'Transport' following the end of tram services in December 1952). The Hobart Municipal Tramways were taken over by the Trust on 1 March 1955, followed by Launceston on 1 July. At its commencement, the MTT operated trams, trolley, petrol and diesel buses, and was authorised to provide public transport services within a radius of seven miles of the Hobart and Launceston General Post Offices (GPO's). On 30 August 1959, the MTT acquired the operations of Norton Coaches, which provided bus services in the Burnie area. This resulted in the MTT operating transport services in the South, North and North-West regions of Tasmania. A year later in 1960 saw the closure of the last of Hobart's tram routes, while in 1968 electric traction was removed altogether from Tasmania's streets when the trolleybuses were retired from both Hobart and Launceston. The MTT began using Metro as its operating name during the late 1980s when the Trust was a division of the Department of Transport. The Metropolitan Transport Trust was dissolved when Metro Tasmania Pty Ltd became a state-owned company in February 1998.Annual Report 2011/12 Metro Tasmania Metro Tasmania has two shareholders, by law both are ministers in the state government. The Treasurer is one shareholder, while the other holds the Transport portfolio or its equivalent. The government appoints directors to the Board of Metro Tasmania, who in turn appoint the Chief Executive Officer. In May 1999, Metro purchased Hobart Coaches which operated services to New Norfolk, Richmond, Blackmans Bay and the Channel areas of Hobart. Hobart Coaches was retained as the brand name of the regional division of Metro, initially operating with separate drivers and buses at separate yards, however both the workforce and the fleet were gradually absorbed into the main operation. Services to Kingston and Blackmans Bay became part of Metro's Hobart urban network, with Channel services operated under a separate non-urban contract. In the period since 1999, some of the former Hobart Coaches routes have been relinquished by Metro either for operational reasons, because contracts were sold to other operators, or due to public transport reviews undertaken by the state government. These include New Norfolk (sold to O'Driscoll Coaches), Richmond (sold to Tassielink Transit) and Cygnet (Metro route via Snug withdrawn following government review - Tassielink services via Huonville continue to operate). As at July 2018, Metro Tasmania employed 481 people statewide. 8.50 million first boardings were recorded in the 2018/19 financial year, an increase of 2.2% (seasonally adjusted) from 2017/18.Ansair bodied MAN 10.180HOCL in December 2012 Custom Coaches bodied Scania K230UB in all over advertising Operations  Hobart  In Hobart, Metro's network extends from Gordon in the southern Channel region, north to Brighton and east to Seven Mile Beach and Opossum Bay with major interchanges in the Hobart, Glenorchy and Rosny Park CBD's and smaller transfer points at Kingston, Howrah Shoreline, Metro Springfield and Bridgewater. Two high-frequency corridors, branded as Turn Up and Go operate between Glenorchy and Hobart via Main Road, New Town Road and Elizabeth Street, and between Howrah Shoreline and Hobart via Clarence Street and Rosny Park. On these corridors a service is scheduled to depart every 10 minutes or better in each direction between 7am and 7pm on weekdays. Hobart's routes are numbered according to their geographical area: * Routes for destinations south of Hobart City are numbered in the 4-- series. * Routes for destinations north of Hobart City are numbered in the 5-- series. * Routes for destinations east of Hobart City are numbered in the 6-- series. * For express variants of routes, the first digit is replaced with an X. * School bus routes on the western side of the River Derwent are numbered in the 2-- series, and on the east in the 3-- series. For morning services the third digit is odd, in the afternoon it is even. Cross-town routes that either bypass Hobart City or travel through the CBD without terminating are Routes 500 (Glenorchy - Hobart - Southern Outlet - Blackmans Bay), 501 (Glenorchy - Hobart - University), 601 (Howrah Shoreline - Rosny Park - Hobart - University), 605 (Howrah Shoreline - Rosny Park - Glenorchy), 694 (Rosny Park - Risdon Vale - Glenorchy) and 696 (Rosny Park - Risdon Vale - Otago/Old Beach - Bridgewater). Some evening and weekend services on the Glenorchy - Hobart Turn Up and Go corridor are operated to/from New Norfolk as Route 722 by O'Driscolls Coaches as part of a Tasmanian Government project aimed at increasing the integration between urban and non-urban services. Since January 2019, non-urban and urban fringe services operated by private companies (O'Driscolls, Tasmanian Redline Coaches and Tassielink Transit) from destinations such as the Huon Valley, Sorell, Richmond and New Norfolk have been permitted to pick up and set down passengers travelling wholly within the Hobart urban area.  Launceston  In Launceston, the Metro network is bounded by the suburbs of Youngtown, St Leonards, Waverley, Rocherlea, North Riverside, Blackstone Heights and Hadspen. The major interchange is located in St John Street in the Launceston CBD. Two high-frequency Turn Up and Go corridors are operated. The first is between the University, Mowbray and the City via Invermay Road, and the second is between the City and Kings Meadows via the Launceston General Hospital, Wellington St and Hobart Rd. A new public transport network for Launceston and surrounding regions was introduced on 19 January, 2020. This review formed part of the Department of State Growth's program of integrating urban and non-urban bus services, and included both Metro and private operators including Manions Coaches, Tassielink Transit, East Tamar Bus Lines and Saintys North-East Bus Service. Private operators are now permitted to pick up and set down passengers travelling wholly within the Launceston urban area. As part of a process of reducing duplication of routes and services, Metro withdrew most of its services to North Riverside via West Tamar Rd and was replaced by Manions Coaches which now includes North Riverside as part of its Legana route. Launceston's routes were re-numbered as part of the review in order to fit into a statewide route numbering system developed by State Growth in conjunction with Metro. The route numbers generally form a pattern according to their geographical area * Northern Suburbs: Rocherlea, Alanvale, Mayfield, Mowbray, University (Routes 110, 115, 116, 117) * Eastern Suburbs: Ravenswood, Waverley, St Leonards (Routes 120, 121, 122, 130, 131) * Southern & Central: South Launceston, East Launceston, Punchbowl, Newstead, Norwood, Youngtown, Kings Meadows (Routes 110, 140, 141, 142, 145, 146, 147) * Riverside & Trevallyn: (Routes 150, 151) * Via Westbury Rd: Hadspen, Casino, Blackstone Heights, Prospect (Routes 160, 161, 162) * Via West Launceston: Prospect Vale, Summerhill (Routes 165, 167) * School buses are numbered in the 800 series but do not follow a geographical pattern. Metro also operates the Tiger Bus service under contract to the Launceston City Council. In the morning and afternoon peaks a commuter shuttle links the CBD with the Inveresk Park & Ride car park, while during the inter-peak period the bus alternates between three tourist-oriented routes known as the City Explorer, River Explorer and Gorge Explorer.  Burnie  In Burnie, Metro operates within the urban area from Chasm Creek in the east to Somerset in the west, and within suburban Burnie as far south as Shorewell Park, Downlands, Havenview and Emu Heights. Non-urban services are provided westward to Wynyard, and eastwards to Penguin and Ulverstone. * Burnie suburban services are numbered between Routes 12 and 54. The two primary services are Routes 41 & 51, a clockwise and anti-clockwise loop linking the Burnie CBD with Upper Burnie, Shorewell Park, Hellyer College, University, North-West Regional Hospital, Park Grove and returning to Burnie. * Services to Wynyard and Somerset are numbered between Routes 60 and 68. * Services to Penguin and Ulverstone are numbered between Routes 70 and 78. Most services between Burnie and Ulverstone are scheduled to connect to Merseylink's Ulverstone to Devonport service. * School buses are numbered in the 200 series. Ticketing Metro currently uses a smartcard ticketing system known as Greencard, alongside paper receipt-style tickets which are only purchasable with cash on the bus. Historically, Metro used paper tickets from its foundation until 1987, when a new magnetic-striped system by Crouzet was introduced in Hobart and Launceston, known initially as Metrofare. This system allowed for easier transfers across the network and an exact fare expiration time of 90 minutes. Upon the ending of this system, all ticketing equipment was sold to Adelaide Metro, who are the last remaining company using the system. Due to its smaller network and patronage, Burnie retained paper tickets and did not use Metrofare. It was not until 2008 when a new system by INIT GmbH began trials, using an electronic card to validate and purchase tickets. The Greencard system was introduced statewide during 2010, and allows for passengers to deposit a desired amount onto their cards, with the balance debited upon each trip. The Greencard system also requires validation on each boarding, and has a fare expiration of 90 minutes from the initial boarding. Unlike many other jurisdictions with electronic ticketing, passengers do not tag off at the end of their journey. Each bus has a single Greencard reader and ticket sales point, which is operated by the driver. Fare types include Adult, Concession/Student and Child, and each are divided into Metro's system of zones based on the distance from the Hobart, Launceston and Burnie CBD's. Fares for non-urban areas such as the Channel, South Arm-Opossum Bay, Wynyard and Ulverstone are set by the Transport Commission. Fleet As at October 2021, Metro had a statewide fleet of 220 buses, consisting of: * 20 Scania N-series Orana rigid buses. (Fleet numbers #633-659). All are located in Hobart. * 85 Scania 12.5m low-floor buses. Buses with Northcoast bodies are numbered #205-243. Buses with Custom Coaches CB60 bodies are numbered #300-336, CB80 bodies are numbered #337-344. * 3 Scania 14.5m low-floor buses. Two buses have Volgren bodies (#202 & 203), while bus #245 has a Northcoast body and was purchased following the loss of 12.5m bus #229 to a vehicle fire in August 2006. * 15 Scania low-floor articulated buses with Custom Coaches bodies. Buses #723-726 have CB60 bodies, while #727-730 and #736-742 have CB80 bodies. * 5 MAN low-floor articulated buses with King Long bodies (purchased second-hand from Skybus in Melbourne). These carry fleet numbers #731-735. * 11 Scania 11.9m low-floor buses (acquired from Melbourne Airport Ltd), numbered #400-410. * 83 Bustech 12.5m XDi low-floor buses, with fleet numbers starting from #800. 100 Bustech XDi 12.5m low-floor buses with Cummins engines are being progressively introduced to the Metro fleet, with the prototype constructed at the Bustech factory in Brisbane and the remaining 99 being built locally in partnership with Tasmanian company Elphinstone Pty Ltd at their factory in Wynyard. These are numbered #800-899. The Launceston fleet became 100% low-floor with the introduction of new timetables on 19 January 2020, the first Metro operating area to do so. Burnie became 100% low-floor at the end of January 2020, and Hobart is planned to become 100% low-floor by the middle of 2021. The Burnie fleet (15 units) consists of four Scania Northcoast buses, eight Scania 11.9m buses (ex-Melbourne Airport) and three Bustech XDi buses. The Launceston fleet (50 units) consists of 30 Scania 12.5m buses (a mix of Northcoast and Custom Coaches CB60 units), and 20 Bustech XDi buses. The Hobart fleet consists of all 20 articulated buses, the three 14.5m buses, three 11.9m buses, 51 Scania 12.5m (Northcoast, CB60 & CB80), 60 Bustech XDi and 20 Scania Oranas. The Oranas are set to be progressively retired by the middle of 2021, by which time the entire statewide fleet will be 100% low- floor accessible. Metro has used a variety of buses in its history, with the MTT commencing in 1955 with AEC Regal half-cab buses. From 1955, over 300 petrol engined Bedford SB3s were purchased followed in the 1970s by 75 Hino BT51s, 64 Leyland Nationals and 68 Volvo B58s.Metro Tasmania - Volvo B58 Disposal List Bus Australia In the 1980s, three Volvo B58s and 19 Volvo B10M articulated buses were purchased, as well as four rigid B10Ms,Metro Tasmania - Volvo B10M Mk11 Rigids Disposal list Bus Australia 28 Mercedes-Benz OH1316s. and the first Scania N112s.\\"Tasmanian Update\\" Australian Bus Panorama 4/6 May 1989 Preserved buses Several vehicles once operated by the MTT and Metro have now been preserved by the Tasmanian Transport Museum and the Tasmanian Bus & Coach Society.

Full restoration complete. * Livery The initial bus livery adopted in 1955 was the same larch green and cream carried by trams and trolleybuses. In the late 1970s a new livery of rolled gold and cream appeared. A re-branding also occurred, shifting away from Metropolitan Transport Trust/MTT to Metro Tasmania, and a two-tone apple green livery was introduced at the time to reflect this. This livery can be seen today on some older buses, and its initial purpose was to signify buses with passenger-operated rear doors. In the early 1990s, new Metro eXpress (MX) services were introduced, and a number of buses were given a livery of green and yellow on white. Both two-tone green and MX livery exist today on older stock, but this has been replaced by a corporate white, with all buses sporting a yellow front to aid with visibility. Depots Metro maintains three large-sized depots, one each in Hobart (Derwent Park), Launceston and Burnie. These depots house Metro's buses and managerial operations, with Hobart being the central office. Each depot contains refuelling and workshop services. The original headquarters for the MTT were in central Hobart, with the Depot in Campbell St. Much of the historical facade still exists today on the corner of Campbell and Macquarie Streets, opposite City Hall. Part of the depot was closed between 1985 and 1987 to allow for the construction of the Sheraton Hotel (now the Hotel Grand Chancellor), and coincided with the opening of the MTT's Springfield Interchange which replaced this lost capacity and also included workshops. Following the Tasman Bridge disaster in January 1975, the MTT was dramatically impacted as it did not have any depot facilities on the eastern side of the Derwent River. A temporary depot was established at Bellerive Oval while work proceeded to construct a new facility at Mornington. This included workshops and driver amenities to enable the MTT's Eastern Shore services to operate independently from the City Depot while the Tasman Bridge was being rebuilt. The Mornington Depot remained an important part of the MTT's operations following the re-opening of the Tasman Bridge in 1977, however its usage gradually decreased as operations began to be centralised at Springfield during the 1980s and 1990s. A small compound was retained for some years for use as a satellite yard before being vacated entirely. Satellite Yards Because of the widespread nature of their services, Metro also have various satellite yards located in non-urban and outer suburban areas. These yards allow buses to begin their daily services in specific places, and can allow for greater early morning frequency for some routes and reduce the need to run buses out of service. The yards have minimal facilities and exist so as buses can be stored overnight, ready to begin an inward service the next day.  Hobart  *MorningtonThe former depot has been replaced by a satellite compound adjacent to the Mornington Waste Transfer Station. *Bridgewater/BrightonBuses used for services for Bridgewater and the northern suburbs are stabled here overnight. Due to its larger size, buses that have been withdrawn from use and are awaiting disposal are also stored at Bridgewater. *KingstonBuses from this yard serve Kingston, Blackmans Bay and some Channel destinations in the morning peak hour. *LauderdaleServing Lauderdale and South Arm in the morning peak. *Woodbridge & Opossum Bay - Small facilities with 1 to 3 buses to operate peak direction services.

As the perception of behaviors and actions vary, intercultural competence is essential. However, a lack of knowledge about the customs and expectations of people in Australia and New Zealand can make even the best intentioned person seem ignorant, inconsiderate or even rude.  Shared expectations  Australia and New Zealand are separate countries, each with its own distinct national identity that includes particular customs and rules of etiquette. While, to outsiders, these cultures can seem very similar, confusing their identities in general conversation is usually not tolerated and will be quickly corrected. Points of etiquette that apply to both countries include the following:  Language  * Requesting a fanny pack can be considered obscene due to the use of \\"fanny\\" as a slang term for female genitalia. \\"Bum bag\\" is the acceptable local variation in some areas.Rebecca Falkoff Unintentional Transgressions of the Work Abroad Community Monster.com Australians and New Zealanders are generally tolerant of foreigners making this mistake and will understand both. * An enquiry about a person's well being (such as \\"How's it going?\\", \\"How are you going?\\" or \\"How are ya?\\") is a common greeting. Generally the accepted response is non-negative; \\"Good thanks\\", \\"Not too bad\\" or \\"Pretty good, mate\\", and it is considered polite to ask the person the same question back. It is considered polite to greet anyone including strangers, in this way. It is considered impolite, or awkward to answer this question with an honest dissertation on how one actually feels, particularly if the respondent wishes to answer in the negative. The question is generally considered an ice breaker and nothing more. * Bragging/Boasting (called 'skiting' by some New Zealanders), or initiating discussion of one's own achievements, is usually considered in poor taste. (See tall poppy syndrome.) * It is acceptable to host a barbecue without supplying all the food and drink. The host may ask guests to bring particular items such as beverages, salad, or meat, often using the initialism \\"BYO\\" (Bring your own) * The term \\"bring a plate\\" is synonymous with \\"potluck\\" Public places * As cars drive on the left side of the road in both countries, people moving forward will generally go to the left as well. When walking on the pavement (usually called the 'footpath'), one should walk on the left, whenever possible. When travelling on escalators or moving walkways, one should keep to the left when standing, or keep to the right when walking. It is expected that walkers will consider people around them (and not just before them) when joining a walkway, and both Australians and New Zealanders assume a large sense of personal space around them. Intrusion of this space in public can be met with confusion or even anger.  Queuing (getting in line/forming a line) is expected when there is any demand for an item or when waiting to board public transport, and is considered basic manners. Queues are formed on a \\"first come, first served\\" line basis. The only exception to this is a pub where people will normally lean on the bar to wait but you should be aware of who is waiting ahead of you because it is rude to accept service from a barman before someone who has been waiting longer. A simple nod or subtle gesture towards the person who has waited longer will be understood by any experienced server to mean that the indicated person was before you. It is considered acceptable for a person facing greater-than-normal difficulty (eg, elderly, pregnant, using a cane/ walking frame/ wheelchair, carrying a baby, minding very young children) to ask \\"Do you mind?\\" and then others will usually allow them to \\"jump the queue\\"; it would be considered rude in that case to refuse. A person who is not obviously in this situation may ask others to allow them to cut in on the basis of urgency (eg, \\"Do you mind? I have to catch a bus in 5 minutes\\", etc) but in that case it is also acceptable for others to decline or to ignore the request. * Spitting in the street or on the footpath, or dropping rubbish while walking is considered to be bad manners. Bars and restaurants * When paying a cashier, it is usual to gently place the money in their hand, demonstrated as an offering rather than forced on the recipient. Similarly, change is usually placed in your hand in return. Snatching money out of a person's hand is considered very bad manners. * Tipping is not expected and some employees may not understand the gesture and return the money. Some employees are forbidden from accepting gratuities (this is mainly in positions of authority e.g. in a casino one cannot tip the dealer or a security guard however, this would not apply in a formal restaurant situation) and tipping face-to-face can create an awkward situation. However, one may like to add a tip to restaurant bills of (generally) no more than 10% if the service has been especially good. It is also acceptable to suggest that taxi drivers or waiters \\"keep the change\\", especially if the difference is small. Tips may be as large or as small as you feel appropriate, but rarely exceed 10%. Where tip jars are provided, they are mostly used for loose change or coins. Included 'service charges', established by the business's owners or managers are rare. * When out with friends, co-workers or relatives, it is common but not compulsory for people to take turns buying rounds of drinks. This is referred to as a 'shout', e.g. \\"It's my shout.\\" There is a more minor expectation that the recipient of a 'shout' will repay the favour by paying for the next round of drinks * A person who takes the last item of food from a common plate, without first offering it to the others at the table may be seen as greedy or inconsiderate. If someone does want more food in this situation and the remaining portion can be split, proposing to halve it is common. * You should treat people serving you as politely as you expect them to treat you, as both cultures perceive themselves as highly egalitarian - to an extent far more than US culture. Use 'please' when placing an order or making a request and 'thank you' when you receive your order or service. They are there to help you, but they are not your inferiors; they are fellow human beings. \\"I want\\", \\"Give me\\" or \\"I'll take\\" are not appropriate phrases to use when ordering food. \\"Could I please have\\" or \\"May I have\\" are far more appropriate phrases to use with staff providing food or any other kind of service. The use of the words \\"Please\\" or \\"May I\\" are important to use. * Complaints in restaurants are rare. Most customers will merely refuse to revisit an establishment after bad food or service. * Surcharges for use of less commonly used credit cards such as Diners Club and Amex commonly apply in many New Zealand and Australian establishments. To avoid conflict most establishments will advertise this with a sign of some sort near the cashier area, and signage will normally indicate if such cards are accepted for payment. * Arguing or yelling with staff in any establishment is considered very rude and inappropriate. 'Making a scene' regardless of the quality of the service is considered very poor form (i.e. culturally unacceptable). Both cultures consider that 'not coming back' to an establishment (and possibly bad mouthing in private) adequate punishment for poor service. * Common restaurant manners include using the knife and fork properly (fork left, knife right only), refraining from burping and placing elbows on a table, placing your napkin on your lap and leaving it folded on the table after use, and eating neatly. Chewing open-mouthed (including chewing gum), slurping loudly, burping and talking with a full mouth are considered very rude. If you do any of these things accidentally, say \\"pardon me\\" or \\"excuse me.\\" * It is considered bad manners to pick one's teeth with the fingers in public. Driving * Waving as a gesture of thanks to drivers that stop to allow you into their lane, exit a driveway, merging into the lane, or cross at a crossing, is viewed as polite. Not doing so is considered rude, even if mildly so. * When driving between towns and cities it is considered rude not to speed up in a passing lane until overtaking slower traffic, after which you are expected to revert to the left (slower) lane. It is important to keep left if not overtaking other traffic, and allow other faster traffic to overtake in the passing (right) lane. Australia General * Although 70% of the population has some Anglo-Celtic ancestry, there is acknowledgement of the country's growing ethnic/racial diversity. * Making jokes at another's expense or \\"taking the piss\\" is common in Australian society and is often a bonding process. However, it is frowned upon and considered cowardly to make jokes in the absence of the subject. Contrary to many other countries, Australians will generally wait until the subject is present before making derogatory jokes. Language * \\"Indigenous Australian\\" and \\"Aboriginal person/Torres Strait Islander\\" are polite terms, also regional/state preferences such as \\"Koori\\" are also acceptable as long the person in question and you both consider each other friends. Aboriginal refers to Indigenous people from the mainland, the Torres Strait Islanders are a separate group with their own cultural traditions. \\"Abo\\", \\"Coon\\", \\"Gin\\" and \\"Boong\\" or \\"Boonga\\" are all considered offensive and unacceptable in formal conversation when describing Aborigines but are sometimes in casual conversations even when one of the participants is of Indigenous descent, though this is controversial and often frowned upon. \\"Aboriginal\\" is now used only as an adjective, although older documents may still use it as a noun (e.g. \\"Aboriginals\\"). Note that the words \\"Coon\\" and \\"Gin\\" are not always considered offensive in other contexts - the former being a popular brand of cheese and the latter a common drink. The politest option is to simply avoid the issue of race. * State/ regional preferences for specific names for groups of Indigenous Australians have also arisen in recent years: The term Koori (or Koorie) in New South Wales or Victoria. Those from Queensland use the term Murri (pronounced the same as \\"Murray\\"). Nunga is used in most of South Australia. Noongar is used in southern Western Australia. Anangu is used in northern South Australia, and neighbouring parts of Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Palawah is used in Tasmania. However, there were over 200 different languages at the time of European settlement, which means these terms are very specific. Ethnic issues * In the UK, the term \\"Paki\\" is considered racially offensive; however, the word also evolved in parallel in Australia as a shortened form of \\"Pakistani\\", similar to the shortening of \\"Australian\\" to \\"Aussie\\". Usually used in a cricketing context, in Australian usage the word refers specifically and solely to people who are Pakistani and carries no derogatory intent, being a term of affection. Indigenous Australians * Amongst Indigenous Australians, it can be taboo to refer to deceased Indigenous Australians by name, or through use of images. New Zealand MƒÅori * Correct pronunciation of MƒÅori words and placenames, and the word \\"MƒÅori\\" itself, is often important to MƒÅori, although usually less so to non-MƒÅori. * It is incorrect to pluralise \\"MƒÅori\\" and loan words from MƒÅori by adding an \\"s\\". There is no letter \\"s\\" in the MƒÅori language, and plurality is indicated by the articles (te/nga/ngati) appearing before the word rather than a word ending. * Sitting on or resting one's backside against a table or desk can offend MƒÅori. A table is where food is served and should not be touched by the \\"unclean\\" regions. Similarly, you should not sit on a pillow; the head is tapu (sacred), and pillows are for resting heads only. * Shoes should always be removed before entering the wharenui (meeting house) on a marae. Never eat inside a meeting house ‚Äî the building is regarded as tapu (sacred). * See also * Modern Etiquette * Etiquette in Africa * Etiquette in Asia * Etiquette in Canada and the United States * Etiquette in Europe * Etiquette in Latin America * Etiquette in the Middle East * Worldwide etiquette References Australia and N Category:Australian culture Category:New Zealand culture ","title":"Etiquette in Australia and New Zealand"},{"id":"8086980","text":"Francine Pelletier in 2018 Francine Pelletier (born 25 April 1959 in Laval, Quebec) is a Canadian science fiction writer, whose work often features strong female protagonists.

The Calgary Stampeders defeated Ottawa Rough Riders 12 to 7. The game is remembered fondly for being the year in which Calgary fans brought pageantry to the Grey Cup, as much as it was Calgary's first Grey Cup victory. Stamps fans created a party atmosphere by staging pancake breakfasts on the steps of City Hall, riding horses into the lobby of the prestigious Royal York Hotel, and starting parades, dances and parties everywhere. Game summary The Calgary defence was able to stop the favoured Rough Rider drives at the 8, 10 and 22 yard lines and hold them scoreless. On one of these Ottawa had successfully faked a punt. On the next possession they ran the fake punt again but Howie Turner was stopped short and Calgary took over at their 46-yard line. They quickly drove into Ottawa territory and scored on a \\"sleeper play\\" pass from Keith Spaith to Norm Hill in the end zone, which meant that Hill ran over to the far sidelines and flopped on the field, essentially hiding. Everybody in the stadium, except the Rough Riders on the field, saw this coming. Hill slipped before he had possession of the ball but he fell on his back and the ball dropped into his hands. Hill's score is sometimes called the \\"sit-down touchdown\\". Bob Paffrath scored a touchdown for the Riders and they also scored a single. In the final quarter Ottawa's Pete Karpuk fumbled a lateral. Calgary's Woody Strode recovered and returned it to the Ottawa eleven yard line. Karpuk did not attempt to recover his own fumble, believing that the whistle had blown. Pete Thodos scored the winning touchdown on an end rush that opened a large hole in the Ottawa defence while Dave \\"Baldy\\" Tomlinson successfully punted in the last winning points. Victory celebration The summary of the victory celebration by Calgary Stampeders supporters at the Royal York Hotel after the game was reported by journalist Jim Coleman. Trivia *The \\"sleeper play\\" was made illegal in the CFL in 1961. *The Calgary Stampeders were undefeated in all 15 games that they played this season, and as of 2018, the only team in the history of what is now the CFL to do so. *Calgary's line up was: Archie McGillis (Manager), Woody Strode, Dave Tomlinson, Johny Aguirre, Paul Rowe, Keith Spaith, Dave Berry, Chick Chikowsky, Bill Pullar, Harry Anderson, Jim Mitchener, Chuck Anderson, Rod Pantages, Jack McGill, Jack Grogan (Past President), Rube Ludwig, Bert Iannone, Harry Hood, Fritz Hanson, Normie Kwong, Tom Brook (President), Les Lear (Coach), Pete Thodos, Bill Wusylk, Cliff Kliewer, Dave Adams, Rudy Singer, Bob Leatham, Fred Wilmot, Frank Porteous (Trainer), Bill Sherriff (Equipment Manager), Harold Geddes (Asst. Equipment Manager), Norm Carter, Cedric Gyles, Norm Hill, Jim Dobbin, Harry Irving. *Among members of the Stampeders who went on to notoriety outside football, Normie Kwong served as Lieutenant Governor of Alberta from 2006 to 2010, and Woody Strode became an actor, appearing in films such as The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.

It was not therefore an English feudal barony which was under full royal jurisdiction, which is the usual sense of the term, but a separate class of barony within a palatinate. After the Norman conquest, William the Conqueror created three earldoms to protect his border with Wales, namely Shrewsbury, Hereford and Chester. Hugh Lupus was appointed Earl of Chester and he appointed his cousin, Nigel of Cotentin, as the first Baron of Halton. Halton was a village in Cheshire which is now part of the town of Runcorn. At its centre is a rocky prominence on which was built Halton Castle, the seat of the Barons of Halton; the castle is now a ruin. The Barons In order, with the dates they held the title, the Barons of Halton were as follows. 1 Nigel of Cotentin :(c. 1071‚Äì1080) He was also the hereditary Constable of Chester. In 1077 he fought against the Welsh at the Battle of Rhuddlan. It is almost certain that he built a motte-and-bailey castle on Halton Hill the remains are still visible today. 2 William FitzNigel :(1080‚Äì1134) The son of Nigel de Cotentin. He also held the honour of being the Marshal of the Earls' host, which was an important position in the Norman military hierarchy. In addition to his land in Halton, his estate included land in other parts of Cheshire and also in Normandy. He married the eldest daughter of Yorfid, the baron of Widnes. Yorfid left no male heir and on his death the Lancashire manors of Widnes, Appleton, Cronton and Rainhill came to William. In 1115 he established a priory of the Augustinian Order of Canons Regular in Runcorn. He was buried at Chester. 3 William fitz William :(1134‚Äì1150) The son of William fitz Nigel. In 1134 he moved the priory from Runcorn to a site to the east of Halton. This became Norton Priory. William died childless in Normandy. 4 Eustace fitz John :(1150‚Äì1157) He obtained the title by marriage, his second wife being the sister of William FitzWilliam. He had inherited the barony of Knaresborough and by his first marriage had also gained the baronies of Malton and Alnwick. He was killed fighting the Welsh. 5 Richard fitz Eustace :(1157‚Äì1171) The son of Eustace fitz John. He married into the de Lacy family of Pontefract. 6 John fitz Richard :(1171‚Äì1190) The son of Richard fitz Eustace. He was a governor in Ireland for Henry II. Being a patron of science, he maintained an astronomer at Halton Castle. He founded a Cistercian monastery at Stanlow. In 1190 he granted the second known charter for a ferry at Runcorn Gap. He served with Richard I in the Third Crusade and died at the siege of Acre. 7 Roger de Lacy :(1190‚Äì1211) The son of John fitz Richard. He adopted the surname of de Lacy. He was a renowned soldier and was nicknamed \\"Hell\\" Lacy for his military daring. In 1192 he was also serving with Richard I in the Third Crusade. Later he served King John in the unsuccessful attempt to thwart the French conquest of Normandy following which he was made High Sheriff of Lancashire. He was buried in the abbey founded by his father at Stanlow. () 8 John de Lacy :(1211‚Äì1240) The son of Roger. He opposed King John and was one of the barons entrusted with the duty of ensuring that the king kept the agreements made in Magna Carta. By marriage he gained more titles, including that of the Earldom of Lincoln. He also gained the manor and the castle of Bolingbroke. He was also buried at Stanlow. 9 Edmund de Lacy :(1240‚Äì1258) Son of John, and of whom little is known, except that he was also buried at Stanlow. 10 Henry de Lacy :(1258‚Äì1311) Son of Edmund. He was educated at court and became Chief Councillor to Edward I. While the king was engaged on military conflicts with the Scots, Henry was appointed Protector of the Realm. He transferred the monastery from Stanlow to Whalley. He died at his London home, Lincoln's Inn and was buried in the old St Paul's cathedral. 11 Thomas, Earl of Lancaster (1311‚Äì1322) Thomas gained the barony of Halton though his marriage to Alice, Henry's daughter. He took up arms against Edward II in 1322. However this rebellion was unsuccessful. He was defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge and then imprisoned in his own castle at Pontefract. A few days later he was beheaded outside the city. Later a cult of martyrdom developed around him. 12 Sir William Glinton (?) :(1322‚Äì1351) There is some uncertainty about the 12th baron. It has been suggested that it was Sir William Glinton. He was a distinguished knight who may have held the honour as a non-hereditary arrangement or he may have held it during the life of Alice, widow of Thomas of Lancaster. Another suggestion is that the 12th baron was Thomas' brother, Henry Wryneck. 13 Henry Grosmont :(1351‚Äì1361) Henry gained the barony of Halton as nephew of Thomas of Lancaster. He was appointed as the 1st Duke of Lancaster, one of the first Knights of the Order of the Garter. He served the king in France and died of the plague. He was buried at Leicester. 14 John of Gaunt :(1361‚Äì1399) John of Gaunt gained the barony by his marriage to Blanche, daughter and heiress of the 13th baron. He was appointed regent during the infancy of Richard II. He was also buried in St Paul's cathedral. 15 Henry Bolingbroke :(1399‚Äì1413) Henry Bolingbroke was the eldest son of John of Gaunt. He was banished from England by Richard II and at the time of his father's death he was in exile in France. When he returned to England to claim his estates the people rallied round him. Richard II was deposed and Henry was crowned King Henry IV. Henry procured an Act of Parliament to ordain that the Duchy of Lancaster would remain in the personal possession of the reigning monarch and the barony of Halton is now vested in that dukedom.

In 1980 he fled Nicaragua for Miami where he began to organize the 15th of September Legion to oppose the Somoza regime. On August 11, 1981, his Nicaraguan Democratic Union (UDN) merged with September 15 Legion to form the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN). A political triumvirate was formed, consisting of Cardenal and Mariano Mendoza from the UDN, and Aristides S√°nchez from the Legion. However, the strong-willed Cardenal alienated his compatriots. His dealings with his Argentine patrons, intended to show that this was a Nicaraguan struggle to which they were only advisors, they found insulting and ungrateful. His assertions of civilian primacy over the military seemed to the high command to be interference in matters in which he was unqualified. He also had contempt for the FDN's political executive committee in Miami, regarding them as a clique of corrupt, bickering petty politicians, who it turn began seeing him as a would-be caudillo. When he declared them disbanded, they in turn dismissed him. Cardenal still enjoyed good relations with the CIA, and they agreed to fund an effort However, the Agency severed funding after he publicly mentioned his plans to create an Internal Front in an interview. His network had been penetrated by Sandinista intelligence from its inception, and they now rolled it up. After this, Cardenal gave up on rebel politics and began selling life insurance in Miami. However, he did not turn on the movement, and when Congress approved $100 million in aid to the Contras in 1986, he appeared at a press conference with the UNO (United Nicaraguan Opposition) leaders to join in the celebrations.

It lies to the north of Settle and east of Giggleswick. The River Ribble runs along the west of the village. Langcliffe lies within one of eight regions covered by the Yorkshire Dales National Park, established in 1954. This covers an area of in the counties of North Yorkshire and Cumbria and straddles the central Pennines in the north of England. A bridleway junction, Langcliffe  History   Pre-historic  Langcliffe Scar is marked by numerous ancient circular-banked enclosures, cairns and quarries. The early settlement was nearer to the foot of the scar than it is now, in a field called Pesbers by the lane to Winskill.  The Manor  In 1086 the Domesday Book, in folio 331V, records that the lord of the manor was named Fech. In Langcliffe he paid taxes on three carucates of ploughland. By 1068 William the Conqueror had put Craven under the overlordship of Roger de Poitou but after 1102, when de Poitou rebelled, King Henry I confiscated his lands and gave those in the Ribble Valley to the House of Percy. The manors of Giggleswick and Langcliffe were subsequently held by the de Giggleswicke family for five generations. In about 1200 the monks of Furness Abbey built a corn mill on the Langcliffe side of the Ribble which caused a protracted controversy. In 1221 Pandulf, the Papal legate, gave judgment that the mill must belong to Langcliffe but that the mill pond would remain with the Abbey of Furness. This judgment still stands, as the Ribble forms the western boundary of Langcliffe, but the mill pond and its fields now pay their rates to Giggleswick. In around 1250, Elias De Giggleswicke granted his property and manorial rights in Langcliffe to Sawley Abbey and in 1524 it was recorded that the 18 tenants still held their houses from the Abbot of Sawley. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries Henry VIII sold the land to the speculator Sir Arthur Darcy (1505‚Äì1561), younger son of the 1st Lord Darcy. In 1584, Nicholas Darcy - Arthur's fifth son - sold the high land to the sitting tenants. Some were not able to purchase immediately and for a time paid quit-rents. At that time Henry Somerscales bought the manorial rights and in 1602 rebuilt Langcliffe Hall in the Elizabethan style.  Wars  In 1314, Scottish raiders destroyed Langcliffe's houses, after the Battle of Bannockburn. The village was then rebuilt, half a mile to the south.

Retrieved 28 September 2013 Watershed Mill on the left.Watershed Mill and Visitors Centre. Retrieved 28 September 2013 Cotton spinning was industrialised by the mid-18th century, but weaving remained a domestic activity based on the putting-out system. Many families had hand looms in their houses but some set up small weaving shops with a few looms and hired others. In the 1820s, weavers expected to produce three pieces of cloth per week for 2 shillings each. Work was irregular as yarn was not always available and it was customary to close the shops for haymaking and harvest to assist the farmers. Plain-cotton weaving could be done by a child of twelve and many parents preferred to have their children earning money rather than going to school. Langcliffe High Mill: this was a spinning-mill, built in 1783‚Äì84 by George and William Clayton and their brother-in-law, R. Walshman. They had previously built a successful spinning-mill at Keighley, and brought with them experienced operators of early Arkwright spinning frames, many of them children, for whom they provided lodgings, clothing and basic education.OCR copy by North Craven Historical Research Retrieved 30 September 2012 This was one of Yorkshire's earliest and largest cotton-spinning mills: 14 bays, 5 storeys high, housing 14,032 spindles. In the early 1800s the mill was enlarged to accommodate a steam engine to supplement its water power. Watershed Mill: this was a weaving-mill, dating from 1785, and is also known simply as 'the Shed'. It is a single-storey building, less than half a mile downstream from Langcliffe High Mill. It was built by friends of Richard Arkwright to house his new spinning machines, but in the 1820s it was converted into a weaving-mill housing 300 looms. Financial difficulties forced the mill-owners to close it in 1855, but Langcliffe High Mill then took it over. Langcliffe High Mill and Watershed Mill continued to operate for another century, before both closed in the 1950s. Langcliffe High Mill then became a paper-mill but now it houses a packaging company. It was made a grade II listed-building on 7 April 1977. Watershed Mill now houses a shopping centre. An 1870s description of Langcliffe described: > ... a village, a township, and a chapelry in Giggleswick parish, W. R. > Yorkshire.

Hoffman Lime-Kiln  Hoffman Lime Kiln The building of the Settle- Carlisle Railway made heavy industry possible in Langcliffe and in 1873 a Hoffman Continuous Kiln was built for the Craven Lime Company. The continuous- kiln had been patented by German inventor Friedrich Hoffman in 1858 and the kiln at Langcliffe had 22 chambers, in which limestone was burned continuously in a circuit that took around six weeks to complete. Lime burning became a key local industry: the operation was labour-intensive and provided significant local employment; however, the working conditions were unhealthy and could be dangerous. The lime industry is now part of the Craven industrial heritage. The quarry and lime-kiln closed in 1931 as a result of falling sales due to outside competition; the kiln was fired-up again in 1937 but closed permanently in 1939. In 1951, arrangements to demolish the chimney were thwarted when it fell down of its own accord on the day before the planned date. Village War Memorial  Landmarks   Langcliffe War Memorial  In the village centre is a war memorial commemorating the men who lost their lives during the two World Wars. There are 15 names on the fountain memorial: 11 from the First World War, and four from the Second World War. Relatives of those who died chose the design of the fountain memorial, which was unveiled on Saturday 17 July 1920.  Samson's Toe  Around one mile to the east of Langcliffe is Samson's Toe, a large glacial erratic boulder which is approximately 8 feet high and rests on small limestone stilts at the edge of a limestone ridge. The shape of the rock, like a huge toe, gave rise to tales about a giant named Samson: \\"according to legend, he lost his footing when jumping across from Langcliffe Scar or Ribblesdale, breaking off his toe whilst attempting this.\\" More prosaically, the boulder was deposited during the last Ice-Age ‚Äì 12,000‚Äì13,000 years ago or more ‚Äì by retreating glacial flows moving from north to south, the boulder being picked up by a glacier somewhere to the north.\\"  Religion  St John the Evangelist Church Langcliffe formed part of the ancient Parish of Giggleswick, but was detached to become a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1851. The new parish required its own church and St John the Evangelist Church was therefore built in 1851, by architects Mallinson and Healey of Bradford. The church site, and the funds for the construction, were given by John Green Paley (1774‚Äì1860), a son of Langcliffe who had prospered with the Industrial Revolution, as a director of Bradford's Bowling Iron Works and of two local railway companies. \\"The tiny chapel with slender bell-turret and steeply-pitched roof overlooks one of the finest village greens in the north and an unspoilt village of enormous architectural interest.

Langcliffe Population Decline, 1881‚Äì2011 ;Notable residents Residents or former residents of this village include the authors: Leah Fleming and Marina Fiorato. The Paley family, benefactors of the St.John the Evangelist, were among the oldest families in the village: they are recorded as being in Langcliffe, and nearby Giggleswick, since at least the 16th century. Thomas Paley (1540‚Äì1592) of Giggleswick is recorded as having married Elizabeth Preston in 1561 in St. Alkeda's church, but their son Johannes (1572‚Äì1597) in time moved out to Langcliffe. The descendants of Johannes then lived quietly in the village for a century before achieving any great form of prominence: Thomas (1597‚Äì1669), John (1632‚Äì1717) and Thomas (1675‚Äì1740). George (1708‚Äì1765), the eldest son of this Thomas, also remained in the village, but his descendants became ‚Äì after various setbacks ‚Äì the branch of the wealthy industrialists, which developed parts of Leeds and Bradford, whilst remaining loyal to their rural roots. A part of this family became established as gentry in Suffolk and Maj.-Gen. Sir Victor Paley, KBE, CB, DSO, DL achieved distinction as a soldier. The Rev. William (1711‚Äì1799), was the second son of Thomas: a graduate of Christ's College, Cambridge University, who moved back to Giggleswick to become headmaster at the Free Grammar School (Giggleswick School) for more than half a century. His son, the Ven. William Paley, DD (1743‚Äì1805), was the well-known writer, theologian and Archdeacon of Carlisle. The descendants of this branch include the respected and eponymous firm of Lancashire architects. Both main branches include clergymen in almost every generation, with medical practitioners also prominent. Paley Road and Paley Terrace in Bradford are named after the Paleys of Langcliffe and Giggleswick.

S. Mardhekar in the mid-forties. The period 1955‚Äì1975 in Marathi literature is dominated by the little magazine movement. It ushered in modernism and the Dalit movement. In the mid-1950s, Dilip Chitre, Arun Kolatkar and their friends started a cyclostyled Shabda. The little magazine movement began to spread like wildfire in 2017 with hundreds of ephemeral to relatively longer lasting magazines including Aso, Vacha, Lru, Bharud and Rucha. The movement brought forth a new generation of writers who were dissatisfied with the Marathi literary establishment which they saw as bourgeois, upper caste and orthodox. Ashok Shahane was the pioneer of the little magazine movement in Marathi in the 1960s. The writers such as Dilip Chitre, Arun Kolatkar, Namdeo Dhasal, Tulsi Parab, Bhalchandra Nemade, Manohar Oak, Bhau Padhye, Vilas Sarang and Vasant Abaji Dahake came to prominence with the movement. Their writing is non- conformist and non-populist. The little magazine movement of the 1960s ran out of steam in the mid-1970s.

Abhidhanantar, Shabdavedk, Saushthav and later on Aivaji, Khel, Anaghrat, and Navakshar Darshan burst upon the scene. The poets such as Manya Joshi, Mangesh Narayanrao Kale, Hemant Divate, Sanjeev Khandekar, Saleel Wagh and Sachin Ketkar who emerged from these little magazines of the 1990s bear witness to the social and cultural transformation, writing with a sensibility that is different from the generation that emerged from the movement of the 1960.Ketkar, Sachin, ed. Live Update: an anthology of recent Marathi poetry. Mumbai: Poetrywala Publications, 2004.  Bengali little magazine movement  Early 20th century In Bengali literature, it started with Kallol, a modernist movement magazine, established in 1923. The most popular among the group were Kazi Nazrul Islam (1899‚Äì1976), Mohitlal Majumder (1888‚Äì1952), Achintyakumar Sengupta (1903‚Äì1976), Satyendranath Dutta (1882‚Äì1922), and Premendra Mitra (1904‚Äì1988). Then Bengali poetry got into the brightest light of modernism in the 1930s, through the movement of a few other little magazines, such as Buddhadeb Bosu's Kabita and Sudhindranath Datta's Parichay. Taputtap This magazine is based on the widely circulated literature, education, culture and social news of India and the state of West Bengal. This magazine, which has been published for over 40 years(1978) and still now publish editor Amal Bondyopadhaya, is a shining example in the world of publishing. The journey of that time came up in our magazine. In keeping with the modern world, we have brought this magazine in the form of a web portal. Through literature and news, we will search for the present and future of the Bengali's. So today we are the archive of news and literature. Krittibas Krittibas first appeared in Kolkata in 1953. It played a highly influential role in the Kolkata literary scene in the decades after Indian independence, and provided a platform for young, experimental poets, many of whom went on to become luminaries of modern Bengali poetry. The editors of the inaugural issue in July 1953 were Sunil Gangopadhyay, Ananda Bagchi and Dipak Mazumdar. Gangopadhyay later became sole editor, and indeed it is his name that is most closely associated with the magazine. Others who also edited the magazine at one point or another included Shakti Chattopadhyay, Sarat Kumar Mukhopadhyay and Samarendra Sengupta. The Phanishwarnath Renu issue of the magazine was edited by Samir Roychoudhury. During 1961-65 several poets left the magazine and joined the Hungryalist Movement. Hungry Generation and anti- establishment movements The little magazine explosion in West Bengal took place after 1961 when the Hungry Generation Movement took the cultural establishment by storm. In fact it changed not only the types of publication but also the naming of magazines. The Hungry Generation Movement aimed at waging a war against the literary establishment and the decadent society in general. Prominent figures included Binoy Mazumdar, Saileswar Ghosh, Malay Roy Choudhury, Subimal Basak, Tridib Mitra, Samir Roychoudhury, Falguni Roy, Subo Acharjo, Pradip Choudhuri, Subhas Ghosh, Basudeb Dasgupta, Sandipan Chattopadhyay, Shakti Chattopadhyay. Utpalkumar Basu, Rabindra Guha, Arunesh Ghosh, Raja Sarkar, Aloke Goswami, Selim Mustafa, Arup Datta, Rasaraj Nath, Rabiul and many others.. There are other Bengali Writers who raised their voice against the establishment but did not join the Hungry generation Movement. Most notable among them is the Subimal Mishra. Other experimental writers who mostly wrote in little magazines include Kamal Kumar Majumdar, Amiyabhushan Majumdar and Udayan Ghosh. 'Kaurab' cult Some major changes occurred in the 1970s in the Bengali little magazine movement, chiefly around Kaurab, a literary and cultural magazine nearly four decades old. Prime cult- figures of Kaurab are: Swadesh Sen, Kamal Chakraborty (original editor), Barin Ghosal, Debajyoti Dutta, Pranabkumar Chattopadhyay, Shankar Lahiri, Shankar Chakraborty and Aryanil Mukhopadhyay (present editor). In international scenario Bengali poetry has been represented by Kaurab poets like Subhro Bandopadhyay, (present assistant editor).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqruZ-BTpA4 New Poetry (Natun Kabita) Since the mid-1980s Bengali literature experienced a new genre of Bengali poetry called New Poetry. From the early 1990s with impetus from a Kolkata-based poetry journal Kabita Campus, New Poetry has begun to gain immense acclaim from the young contemporary poets of Bengal. In 2003 some poets of this genre have started a journal named Natun Kabita containing their ideas and poems, through both online and print media. Poets who joined this movement in the mid-1990s are: Barin Ghosal, Ranjan Moitro, Swapan Roy, Dhiman Chakraborty, Alok Biswas, Pronob Pal, Saumitra Sengupta, Rajarshi Chattopadhyay, Atanu Bandopadhyay, Rajatendra Mukhopadhay, Pradip Chakraborty.

Postmodern Bengali poetry  Samir Roychoudhury and Prabhat Choudhuri heralded a new phase in Bengali poetry in 1990s known as Postmodern or Adhunantika Poetry with the launching of Haowa#49 quarterly and Kabita Pakshik fortnightly, respectively. However the interpretation of Postmodernism are quite different for both the magazines.

The results showed the ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) winning 82% of the vote and 191 of 220 seats in the Parliament of Angola. The main opposition UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) won 10%. The international response was mixed, with the European Commission, the United States and the Southern African Development Community praising the elections as generally fair, while Human Rights Watch has questioned the legitimacy of this result. UNITA accepted the MPLA's victory. Background Voter registration was to take place in late 2006 and through 2007. It was originally meant to be held in 1997, but was postponed numerous times due to organizational and logistical problems.

Dos Santos said that the election would \\"be exemplary to the world\\", while UNITA leader Isaias Samakuva said that it would not be followed by a crisis, as occurred in the aftermath of the 2007 Kenyan election and the 2008 Zimbabwean election. Campaigning Campaigning began on August 5, 2008. The parties were each allowed five minutes on television and ten minutes on the radio per day for campaigning purposes. There were also programmes on television, each lasting an hour, that were devoted to discussing the government's accomplishments in a positive light; UNITA leader Isaias Samakuva described this as \\"shocking\\", while expressing confidence that the people would not believe these programmes.\\"MPLA set for clean sweep in Angolan polls\\", The Star (IOL), August 27, 2008, page 4. Prior to the start of the campaign period, MPLA posters and symbols were already plentiful in major cities. The MPLA emphasizes its work in rebuilding and developing the country following the end of the civil war in 2002, and the party was perceived as having a very strong institutional advantage. It was widely expected to win the election. UNITA concentrated its campaign in rural areas, while the remaining parties tended to conduct their small-scale campaigns, which were characterized by festive gatherings, in Luanda, the capital. The UNITA campaign stressed the party's claims that the MPLA government had made insufficient progress in rebuilding the country following the end of the civil war and had failed to alleviate poverty. UNITA alleged that the campaign occurred in \\"a climate of threats, intimidation and violence\\", that four of the party's supporters were killed, and that some parts of the country were effectively MPLA \\"fiefdoms\\" where campaigning by other parties was impossible.\\"Angola prepares for landmark peacetime vote\\", AFP (IOL), September 3, 2008. According to Radio Ecclesia, 13 people were arrested on August 11 for allegedly holding an unauthorized rally and causing traffic disruption while campaigning for UNITA in Rangel, near Luanda. On August 13, campaigning members of UNITA were attacked by over 100 MPLA supporters at Londuimbali in Huambo Province, according to UNITA official Alcides Sakala; he said that the MPLA supporters were armed with \\"machetes, stones and sticks\\". The clash was reportedly broken up by police firing into the air.Henrique Almeida, \\"MPLA criticises HRW\\", Reuters (IOL), August 15, 2008. Each party was planned to receive about one million dollars from the government for campaign purposes. Opposition parties said that they had not received any money by early August, and Front for Democracy leader Filomeno Vieira Lopes expressed concern that the money might not be distributed until after the election was held, as was the case for the 1992 election. The PDP- ANA complained that the amount was too small, describing it as a \\"laughable\\" sum. The PLD also said that the amount was insufficient. Furthermore, according to PLD President Analia Victoria Pereira, the MPLA had full access to the resources of the government and military to assist in its campaign. The parties eventually received the campaign money that was promised, although they protested that it came late due to procedural delays. Wary of such interference or disruption due to MPLA institutional influence, most of the parties chose to print materials for the election in South Africa rather than Angola.Antonio da Silva, \\"Angola gearing for election\\", The Star (IOL), September 3, 2008, page 4.

The report stressed the need \\"to safeguard freedom of assembly and expression and access to the media by all stakeholders, and to establish an impartial national electoral body\\"; it also said that the government had not \\"provided adequate security to political parties\\" and was failing \\"to ensure political tolerance and full participation of citizens.\\" Prime Minister Fernando Dias Dos Santos responded to the report on the same day with an assurance that the election would be \\"free, fair and transparent\\". MPLA spokesman Norberto dos Santos also replied to the report on August 14, saying that it was \\"offensive and has no basis of truth\\". He accused Human Rights Watch of interfering in the election and Angola's internal affairs. Dan Mozena, the United States Ambassador to Angola, said in an interview with Radio Ecclesia on August 28 that the US would send 40 observers for the election. He said that expectations for the election were high and spoke approvingly of the conduct of the electoral process up to that point; according to Mozena, the election had the \\"potential to be a model for the coming elections in Africa if all the actors continue to play their part\\". Human Rights Watch released another statement in early September, expressing doubt that the election would be fair. According to the statement, the MPLA benefited from \\"state funding and media coverage\\", while the other parties received their allotted campaign money late. The statement also said that Human Rights Watch had \\"documented ... intimidation of the opposition and media, interference in the electoral commission, and violent incidents against the opposition\\" in the period prior to the start of campaigning.

Criticizing the problems, UNITA leader Samakuva and PDP-ANA leader Sindiangani Mbimbi said that the election should be canceled and held over again. According to Samakuva, some of his party's delegates had \\"received false credentials, or were given wrong addresses of non-existent polling stations\\", and he said that there was widespread confusion in Luanda; meanwhile, Mbimbi condemned the election as \\"political theatre\\". As a result of the problems, the electoral commission announced that 320 polling stations would open again on September 6; however, it also asserted that the election had proceeded properly at most polling stations. The election reportedly became more orderly and functional in Luanda later in the day on September 5, and most of the country reportedly avoided the problems that plagued the vote in Luanda. In an interview with a South African radio station on September 8, Samakuva alleged that some people were told and even forced to vote for the MPLA.

Today the state is home to a number of Jain monuments, such as temples, Gommata statues and stambhas. History Historical association of Jainism with Karnataka dates back to the 3rd century BC. Acharya Bhadrabahu, predicted a twelve-year-long famine in north India and led the migration of Jain sangha to the south. He was accompanied by his disciple Chandragupta Maurya and the Sangha halted at Chandragiri Hill. Realising that he was nearing the end of his life, Bhadrabahu instructed his disciples to spread the religion and he undertook sallekhana at Chandragiri. Chandragupta Maurya continued to live on this hill worshipping the foot prints of his teacher and later he too took Sallekhana. There are two monuments on the hill recalling this event, a rock cut cave called Bhadrabahu cave and a structural shrine called the Chandragupta Basadi. Architecture and monuments Akkana Basadi, Shravanabelagola There are a number of monuments relating to the Jain religion in Karnataka. The Jain monuments include smaller shrines, Jain temples (known as Bastis or Basadis), Gommata statues and Sthambas (pillars). Moodabidri,(‡≤∏‡≤æ‡≤µ‡≤ø‡≤∞ ‡≤ï‡≤Ç‡≤¨‡≤¶ ‡≤¨‡≤∏‡≤ß‡≤ø) is home to the 1000 Pillar Jain temple.

Imbued with an intense religious feeling, lavish patronage was extended towards the building of basadis, temples and magnificent statues. Jainism enjoyed the highest repute among the people particularly the ruling classes and the mercantile community thus virtually becoming the state religion. The earliest dated structure is a Basadi at Halasi built under the Kadamba Dynasty of Banavasi thus laying the foundation for Jain architecture in North Karnataka. Rastrakutas period is the golden age of Jainism in Karnataka. The Jaina monuments of the Rashtrakutas period are found at Pattadakal, Malkhed, Lakshmeshwar, Koppal, Bankur, of North Karnataka. Jainism exerted considerable influence over the cultural life of Karnataka during the rule of the Rashtrakutas. Kadambas of Banavasi were known to be patrons of Jainism. After the rule of the Kadambas of Banavasi most parts of north Karnataka came under the rule of the early Chalukya or Badami Chalukyas. The Chalukyas of Badami built cave temples at Badami, Pattadkal and Aihole. Puligere was a strong centre of religious activities of the Jain monks during this era. Lakkundi in Gadag District has a large Brahma Jinalaya of Chalukya style, built by a noble lady, Attimabbe. Navagraha Jain Temple at Varur near Hubli is one of the major pilgrimage. The temple features a 61 feet (18.6 m) tall monolithic idol of the Shri 1008 Bhagavan Parshvanatha and the smaller statues of the other 8 Jain teerthankaras.Hubli gets magnificent ‚Äòjinalaya‚Äô.

The intended cost for the aircraft was advertised by the company as being US$1.89 million dollars in March 2009.D-JET Program Update , pg 3. Last accessed 8 August 2009. Development of the D-JET has been disrupted by funding shortfalls during the Great Recession. By February 2013, the development program had been suspended pending company reorganization, which included the workforce related to the D-JET being laid off. During May 2014, Diamond confirmed the continued suspension of the programme, but stated that it had not been cancelled. During December 2016, a majority share of Diamond Aircraft Canada was sold to Chinese firm Wanfeng Aviation; reportedly, this shall result in a detailed re-assessment of the D-JET program, including options for the potential resumption of its development. Development Early development During 2006, Austrian aircraft company Diamond Aircraft announced that it was engaged in the development of a very light jet, which it referred to as the D-Jet. At the time, the company stated that it had targeted the design at the owner-pilot market, viewing the type as possessing greater practical for single-pilot operations than competitive jets, such as the Eclipse 500 and the Cessna Citation Mustang. By limiting the maximum altitude of the D-JET to 25,000 feet, any instance of a pressurization failure would be rendered as less critical emergencies. Diamond intended for the D-JET to possess a lower operating cost than other very light jets.McClellan, J. Mac. \\"Flying Diamond's D-Jet.\\" Flying Magazine, 19 November 2009. NBAA, 8 November 2007 On 18 April 2006, the maiden flight of the D-JET was conducted from the London International Airport (ICAO: CYXU) in Ontario, Canada the homebase of Diamond's North American division. The flight was piloted by test pilot G√©rard Guillaumaud and lasted 1:06 hours. The aircraft's public debut was at Oshkosh in July 2006.AvWeb Article Diamond D-Jet First Flight By Mary Grady, Newswriter, Editor April 20, 2006AvWeb Article Diamond D-Jet To Debut At Oshkosh By Mary Grady, Newswriter Editor May 31 2006 At that time Diamond expected certification to be complete by the middle of 2009 with deliveries starting at the same time. On 9 November 2006, at the AOPA Expo in Palm Springs, California, United States, Diamond announced that ATP Flight School (ATP) had placed the first fleet order for 20 D-JETs. At that point, the declared intention was that ATP would provide factory-approved training to D-JET purchasers beginning in 2008. Toronto-based Chartright Air Group also placed an order for 10 D-JETs, it was announced that this order came with an expected delivery window set to occur during 2010. On 20 July 2007, Diamond Aircraft announced the roll out of its second D-JET, serial number 002. Serial number 002 is the first D-JET intended to conform to the expected production configuration in its structural layout and aerodynamic design. D-JET prototype serial number 002 first flew on 14 September 2007. It was joined by D-JET Serial Number 003, which first flew on 15 April 2008.Aero-News April 16, 2008 Article Diamond's Third D-Jet Takes To The Skies During February 2008, Diamond announced that the aircraft was to be manufactured in a new facility located in London, Ontario, Canada. At the time, Diamond claimed that total research and development costs for the D-JET were set to be around Cdn$95.2 million and that the plant to construct the type had been anticipated to cost an additional $100 million. This announcement of the manufacturing details came shortly after an announcement by the Government of Canada that it had issued the company with a \\"Cdn$19.6 million strategic, repayable investment\\", while the Government of Ontario had separately announced that it had given Diamond Cdn$11 million. The Government of Ontario loan was contingent on a matching loan from the federal Canadian government, however, this was ultimately not approved; this failure to emerge was attributed as having heavily impacted efforts to progress the D-JET programme.Morrison, Murdo. \\"Diamond Canada left wondering if government will recognise jewel in its aerospace crown.\\" Flight International, 23 May 2011. The D-JET was initially to be powered by a single Williams FJ33-4A-15 turbofan engine, capable of producing of thrust. However, during early 2008, the engine was determined to produce insufficient bleed air to feed systems such as cabin pressurization and other functions; as a result, a decision was made to switch to a more powerful version of the same powerplant, designated as the FJ33-4A-19, which was capable of producing of thrust.Flying Magazine. Engine Swap for the D-Jet: Program Delayed. June 2008, page 20. Hachette Filipacchi Media. The switch in engines was responsible for a delay in the D-JET's certification schedule which then resulted in the projected first customer deliveries being pushed back into the spring of 2009. During October 2008, Canadian charter operator SwiftJet announced that they had ordered five D-Jets with options for ten more. SwiftJet's intention is to offer air taxi service \\"anywhere and anytime to destinations around the world.\\" At the time, SwiftJet operated a single Dassault Falcon 20 in the charter role. During 2010, it was revealed that Diamond was also undertaking development work upon a military trainer variant of the D-JET, which was reportedly intended to be sold for under US$3M; amongst the believed changes intended for the trainer role included the installation of Martin-Baker-built lightweight ejection seats. Funding shortfalls and suspension Flight testing and program development was halted in the spring of 2011 as the company lacked funds to proceed. After a failed campaign for federal government support, private investment was found and test flight resumed in September 2011. During July 2012, the company announced that 700 hours of flight testing had been completed, during which the prototypes had attained a top speed of Mach 0.56 ( true airspeed) along with 30,000 pressurization cycles on a test fuselage. Around this time, a set of winglets were installed upon the prototype with the aim of improving roll control throughout the entirety of its speed range, especially during stall conditions. Following this addition, the design was frozen and the company proceeded to commence the construction of production tooling for the fourth serial aircraft. At this time, certification of the D-JET was forecast to occur during late 2013, while the first deliveries of production aircraft were to commence during the third quarter of 2014. During April 2012, Maurer indicated that other companies had been hiring their laid-off workers, especially engineers. American manufacturer Piper Aircraft announced that as many as 25 engineers may be moving to Vero Beach, Florida to work on their own personal jet programme, the Altaire. Media reports also indicated that Canadian conglomerate Bombardier Aerospace may have issued offers to up to 85 workers to work on the Learjet 85 in Wichita, Kansas. Maurer said that the loss of laid-off workers will hurt a restart of the D-Jet program should government funding be approved and described the situation as \\"dire\\". At the end of April 2011, Maurer issued a public appeal in the London Free Press for the C$35M loan from the Government of Canada, indicating that if it was not forthcoming that the company might cease operations. Maurer also indicated that the hiring of his laid-off staff by competing firms might lead to its termination regardless, saying \\"With the loss of this team, the building of a replacement team would add cost and time that the program and company may not survive.\\" By mid-May, the company had hired back 11 engineers to prevent other companies picking them up and was hoping to have a decision on the federal loan request after a new cabinet is sworn in. In analyzing the declining of the loan, Joseph D'Cruz of the University of Toronto Rotman School of Management indicated that in his opinion the government made the right decision in turning Diamond down. He said, \\"It's such a high risk, nobody in their right mind would invest...That particular market for that aircraft is a relatively small market and it's unproven....Could this jet go ahead without government assistance? The answer is a definite 'no,' because it's not viable without the federal government.\\" During May 2011, Maurer said that he had always considered the Canadian government loans a \\"long shot\\" and that the company was looking at other sources of funding to bring the D-Jet to market, including potential Chinese investment. On 14 June 2011, the company announced that it secured private financing from an unnamed source and started recalling its workers, indicating that it would build an extra test aircraft and resume flight testing. Flight testing started again in early September 2011. During February 2013, having not located further operational funding after the failed sale of the company to Medrar in 2011, the company laid off the majority of its Canadian staff and suspended work on the D-Jet program, indicating that the company needed to reorganize. By May 2014, work on the D-Jet remained suspended, but the project had not been cancelled. The program remained suspended in February 2016. Following the sale of a majority share of Diamond Aircraft Canada to Wanfeng Aviation of China in December 2016, a re-assessment of the D-Jet program for possible resumption of development will be conducted. Design The Diamond D-JET is a very light jet aircraft, seating up to five personnel and powered by a single engine. A key attribute of the design was its high level of stability during flight, which was reportedly present through its full envelope even during challenging manoeuvres. As a result of its clean exterior design, the D-JET possesses relatively low drag, enabling the aircraft to glide in excess of 65 miles from its 25,000-foot ceiling altitude. The cabin of the D-JET was intended to feature various design elements to enhance onboard comfort, such as the proposed seating layout and the low vibration levels present during flight, for both passengers and crew. The center cockpit pedestal is cantilevered to ease entrance and egress in comparison to some competitors. Separated baggage compartments are located within the interior of the aircraft's nose and to the aft of the main cabin, both of which being externally accessed. The D-JET is powered by a single Williams FJ33-4A turbofan engine, which is equipped with an electronically controlled full- authority digital engine control (FADEC) system. Various functions, such as engine startup and over-speed selection prevention, have been automated and are seamlessly performed by the FADEC system. For redundancy, the dual-channel FADEC system uses four independent electrical power sources in addition to battery backup. Diamond opted to adopt a centerline location for the engine, air for which is fed through inlets embedded into the wing roots. The central location of the engine places makes it close to the center of gravity of the D-JET, reducing pitch forces, however, there are some drawbacks to this approach, including elevated air losses within the ducting arrangement used and a greater likelihood of foreign object ingestion. According to aviation publication Flying Magazine, the controls of D-Jet \\"feel completely natural...stability is excellent, and I found the workload to be very low\\". Akin to most jet aircraft, possessing a wide range between minimum and maximum airspeeds, the D-Jet has a larger pitch trim range than a piston-engined counterpart, thus use of the trim control through the takeoff and landing procedures is necessitated to a greater degree than propeller-driven aircraft. The D-Jet is outfitted with relatively large slotted flaps, which were reportedly crucial to achieve the 61-knot maximum stall speed certification required by any single-engine aircraft. These flaps, which resulted in no meaningful pitch changes during retraction or extension, were designed to ease their usage. The avionics of the D-JET comprise a Garmin G1000 glass cockpit, the large multi-function display of which taking center-place on the cockpit dashboard, akin to aircraft such as the Cessna Mustang. For de-icing purposes, Diamond opted for pneumatic boots on the wing's leading edges, bleed air for heating the inlets and ducts, and electric heating for the windshields and probes; in particular, Goodrich developed a considerably thinner de-icing system for the D-JET. The landing gear is electrically-actuated on later-built prototypes; atypically, the landing gear is designed to be used as an air brake during landing approaches, being deployable at speeds as high as 200 knots.

See constructible polygon. 65537 is the integer after 65536 and before 65538. In mathematics 65537 is the largest known prime number of the form 2^{2^{n}} +1 (n = 4). Therefore, a regular polygon with 65537 sides is constructible with compass and unmarked straightedge. Johann Gustav Hermes gave the first explicit construction of this polygon. In number theory, primes of this form are known as Fermat primes, named after the mathematician Pierre de Fermat. The only known prime Fermat numbers are 2^{2^{0}} + 1 = 2^{1} + 1 = 3, 2^{2^{1}} + 1= 2^{2} +1 = 5, 2^{2^{2}} + 1 = 2^{4} +1 = 17, 2^{2^{3}} + 1= 2^{8} + 1= 257, 2^{2^{4}} + 1 = 2^{16} + 1 = 65537.

This value was used in RSA mainly for historical reasons; early raw RSA implementations (without proper padding) were vulnerable to very small exponents, while use of high exponents was computationally expensive with no advantage to security (assuming proper padding). 65537 is also used as the modulus in some Lehmer random number generators, such as the one used by ZX Spectrum, which ensures that any seed value will be coprime to it (vital to ensure the maximum period) while also allowing efficient reduction by the modulus using a bit shift and subtract.

It was the band's final studio album, as they broke up on Halloween 2005. Contrary to the album's title, it is not a \\"live\\" album but rather a studio recording. Although the album received generally positive reviews, many consumers were confused by its title and assumed it to be a live album, which in fact it was not. The title was actually a reference to Camp X-Ray, the temporary detention facility located at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Some fans and critics expressed their disappointment at the album's length, stating that a playing time of 26 minutes was not sufficient for a full-length album and that they had expected more creative output from the band. By this time, however, the band's members had drifted heavily into other projects (most notably singer/guitarist John Reis, who was simultaneously playing in Hot Snakes and Sultans and running his record label Swami Records) and were not as creatively dedicated to Rocket as they had been in the past. Cryptic liner notes written by Long Gone John seemed to indicate that the album was a \\"last gasp\\" of a band in turmoil and that it might be their final album. Touring in support of Live from Camp X-Ray was sparse due to the band members' commitments to other projects, and they would perform infrequently over the next few years. In August 2005, after breaking up Hot Snakes, Reis announced that Rocket from the Crypt would play their final performance on Halloween of that year. This confirmed suspicions that Live from Camp X-Ray was the band's final studio album, though posthumous releases of material recorded before their breakup have since been released.

The clan does not currently have a chief therefore it is considered an Armigerous clan. History Origins of the clan The barony of Straiton is in the county of Midlothian on the outskirts of the city of Edinburgh. There are also baronies of a similar name in Ayrshire and in Fife. The historian Alexander Nisbet said that the family received their lands of Straiton from David I of Scotland. Alexander Straiton of that Ilk and Andrew Straiton of Craig served on the inquest for Sir Alexander Fraser of Pilforth to succeed to the estates of his grandfather. Wars of Scottish Independence In 1296 Thomas de Straton appeared on the Ragman Rolls. Alexander de Straton was one of the signatories to the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320. The historian George Fraser Black has suggested that he may be the same Alexander de Straton who is described as of our blood in a charter by David II of Scotland to him. In 1351 John de Stratton dominus ejusdem (of that Ilk) witnessed a charter of lands. 15th century In 1411 Alexander Straiton, or Stratton, was killed at the Battle of Harlaw. The Clan Straiton also held lands in Aberdeenshire and near Inverness. In 1451 Cristina de Stratone granted a charter in favour of the Friars Preachers in Aberdeen. Castles *Straiton, which was four and a half miles south of Edinburgh Castle was held by the clan from the thirteenth century or earlier.

He was one of the most successful racehorses foaled outside the United States with his near miss in the 1957 Kentucky Derby and his record 1957 Belmont Stakes win. His exact foaling date was unknown or at best debated over the years of his life and many years after. The supporting evidence from a review of foaling stall records in Ireland indicates that he was born on the Saturday after St. Patrick's Day during a highly productive foaling weekend for many thoroughbred mothers on the same farm. His dam, Majideh, is recorded as being in the foaling stall without a live foal until March 20, 1954 at approximately 7:45 AM. Racing career Performance at Kentucky Derby Gallant Man is remembered primarily for his upset loss in the 1957 Kentucky Derby. He would almost certainly have won the race, but his jockey, Hall of Famer Bill Shoemaker, misjudged the finish line and stood up too early in his stirrups, which slowed Gallant Man's rush for the wire and allowed another Hall of Fame jockey, Bill Hartack riding Iron Liege, to take the win by a nose. As noted in books, in articles, and on online sites, Shoemaker's error remains one of the biggest blunders in racing history. Career after the Derby After the Derby, Hall of Fame trainer John Nerud sent Gallant Man out to decimate the field in the Belmont Stakes, winning by 8 lengths, beating the favorite Bold Ruler. The track and race records Gallant Man achieved that day stood until Bold Ruler's son, Secretariat's 1973 Belmont Stakes. Subsequently, Gallant Man beat Bold Ruler in the Metropolitan Mile, and his Jockey Club Gold Cup was achieved against older horses. Gallant Man raced as a three- and four-year-old at the same time as Bold Ruler and Round Table, who both became Horse of the Year. Gallant Man, who had at one time or another beaten each of them, was never awarded a racing honor or a championship of any kind. He ranks #36 in Blood- Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century. (Round Table ranks #17 and Bold Ruler ranks #19.) A small brown horse by (Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner) Migoli out of Majideh (winner of both the Irish Oaks and the Irish 1,000 Guineas), Gallant Man stood a little over fifteen hands and was afflicted with bad ankles. If Ralph Lowe had listened to his vet, Gallant Man would not have been bought in the group of nine horses acquired from the Aga Khan ($220,000 for the crop of Irish yearlings). However, Lowe's bloodstock agent, Humphrey Finney, thought the little horse might be perhaps the worst of the lot, but was still a good buy. Retirement Retired after his 1958 season with a splint problem in his left foreleg, Gallant Man stood at Kentucky's Spendthrift Farm, where he sired 52 stakes winners. He did even better as a broodmare sire. Genuine Risk (from one of his daughters) and Gallant Bloom were two of his breeding triumphs. Death After being pensioned in 1981, Gallant Man was euthanized on September 7, 1988 at the age of 34 after a losing battle with lameness, respiratory problems, and many failing organs. When Gallant Man passed, John Nerud said, \\"When he was sound and good, a horse never lived who could beat him ... he had it all‚Äîspeed and endurance.\\" Longevity According to the most up to date records on past racehorses, Gallant Man is the longest-lived racehorse ever to win any Triple Crown race, surpassing Count Fleet, who lived for 33 years and 8 months, on November 30, 1987. His longevity genes continued throughout the generations. Nearly 20 years to the day of his death, his granddaughter Genuine Risk, who lived 31 1/2 years, died naturally from similar health problems, but also became the longest-lived filly ever to win a Triple Crown race. His grandson Lord Avie became one of the few thoroughbred racehorses to place third or better in all of his races and is the longest-lived horse with this distinction. In 2012, Lord Avie at 34 surpassed his grandfather in longevity by approximately 2 1/2 months. Another of one of Gallant Man's granddaughters, Lady Ophelia, a former racer, was still living at 36 years old (2015).

He served as an estate overseer for Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski and later the family of Dani≈Çowicze who inherited his lands; for that service in 1620 he was awarded three villages: Sulim√≥wka, Kuczakiw (today Kirove) and Lebedyn. All the villages today belong to the Boryspil Raion, Kiev Region. His sons included Stepan (died 1659), a captain of Boryspil company, and Fedir (died 1691), a colonel of Pereiaslav regiment.

In 1635, after returning from an expedition to Black Sea against the Ottomans, he decided to rebel against the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth, which at that time controlled most of the Cossack territories, and whose nobility was trying to turn militant Cossacks into serfs. Ivan Sulyma took part in numerous campaigns of Sagaidachny against Tatars and Turks. In particular, it was the famous capture of Kafa (modern Theodosia), the main center of the slave trade on the Black Sea, Trapezont, Izmail, and also two attacks on Tsaregrad. On the night of 3 to 4 August 1635 he took the newly constructed Kodak fortress by surprise, burning it and executing its crew of about 200 people under Jean Marion. Soon afterwards however his forces were defeated by the army of hetman Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski and Sulima was turned over to the Commonwealth by Cossack elders or starshina. Together with several other leaders of his rebellion, Hetman Sulyma was executed in Warsaw on 12 December 1635. At first, the Polish King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Waza, known for his friendly attitude towards the Cossacks, was hesitant to execute Sulyma, especially since he was a person upon whom the Pope himself bestowed his medal.

Biography Born to a middle class Orthodox Jewish family from Austria as Jacob Orgenstein, Orgen became a well known labor slugger for Benjamin \\"Dopey Benny\\" Fein by the early 1910s. Being ambitious, he had formed his own gang, \\"The Little Augies\\" c. 1911. He operated his labor rackets diligently for the next five or six years until his former boss, Dopey Benny, had faded from prominence. His rising star was soon put on hold, however, when \\"Kid Dropper\\" Nathan Kaplan and Johnny Spanish were both released from Sing Sing in 1917. While they worked together at first, they soon resumed their old rivalry and each formed their own separate gang. Orgen was even further hindered in his rise in 1919 when he was jailed on a robbery charge. Kid Dropper eventually eliminated Spanish that same year and reigned supreme while Orgen was in jail. While Orgen was in prison, his gang barely held together and fought, often unsuccessfully, against Kaplan's gang while waiting patiently for their leader to return to the streets. Orgen was released and on the streets again in 1923. Quickly becoming a formidable rival again to Kaplan, Orgen gradually built up a powerful organization which included members such as gunmen Louis \\"Lepke\\" Buchalter, Jacob \\"Gurrah\\" Shapiro, and Jack \\"Legs\\" Diamond. Orgen, allied with Solomon Schapiro, challenged Kaplan over labor slugging activities, particularly in the garment district. In 1923, a gang war broke out after a dispute over striking \\"wet wash\\" laundry workers. After several months of fighting, including a particularly violent gunfight on Essex Street resulting in the deaths of two bystanders, Kaplan was murdered by gunman Louis Kushner, a man attached to Orgen's organization, on August 28, 1923. With Kaplan's death, Orgen gained complete control over labor racketeering. By 1925, Orgen, in partnership with Legs Diamond, had started to move into bootlegging, supplying Broadway night clubs and speakeasies. He also kept up his original core occupation of labor slugging. City officials soon began investigating union racketeering in New York which threatened to expose other criminal operations. In 1927, through intermediary Louis Buchalter (although some sources claim Meyer Lansky), Orgen was advised by Arnold \\"The Brain\\" RothsteinArnold Rothstein Chronology at www.davidpietrusza.com to concentrate on infiltrating labor unions instead of traditional labor slugging and strong arm tactics. Personal life In 1926, Orgen became a father when his wife gave birth to a girl whom the couple named Zelda. With his increasing wealth, Orgen moved his family out of the Lower East Side to the more affluent Upper West Side. Though the labor rackets were originally his main source of income, by the mid-1920s, Orgen was expanding his horizons into bootlegging and other rackets. Death On October 16, 1927, while walking on Norfolk Street in a Manhattan neighborhood on the Lower East Side, Orgen was killed by Buchalter and Shapiro in a drive-by shooting. Orgen's bodyguard Jack Diamond was also seriously wounded during the attack. Although 34 years old at the time of his murder, Orgen's tombstone in Mount Judah Cemetery reads simply \\"Jacob Orgen, Age 26 Years\\", because his father had disowned him after he formed the \\"Little Augies\\" in 1919 at the age of 26.Robert A.

The film relates to six of the twelve labours of Heracles. The film starts with shots of young male bodybuilders working out in a gym, posing on a stage and flexing their muscles. Each of the labours are then announced by on-screen text in the form of a question, followed by related scenes of modern challenges intercut with the bodybuilders. The audio track of the film is saxophone jazz and sounds from a gym. The question Wird er den Augiasstall s√§ubern? (Will he clean the Augean stables?) is followed by scenes of a garbage dump, Wird er die lern√§ische Schlange t√∂ten? (Will he kill the Lernaean Hydra?) is followed by a huge line of stopped traffic on a motorway and people walking around outside their cars, Wird er die Rosse des Diomedes bez√§hmen? (Will he tame the Mares of Diomedes?) is followed by scenes of car racing and several race crashes including a crash into the spectators and shots of the subsequent disaster and piles of bodies, Wird er die Amazonen besiegen? (Will he defeat the Amazonians? (Hippolyta)) is followed by scores of young women marching in uniform, Wird er die Giganten bezwingen? (Will he conquer the giants? (Geryon)) is followed by shots of rubble of a destroyed apartment building and men in uniform searching the wreckage, Wird er sich der stymphalischen V√∂gel erwehren? (Will he resist the Stymphalian birds?) is followed by jets flying in formation, shooting missiles and dropping bombs on training targets. The last shot of the film is of a bodybuilder's buttocks as he goes off the stage through the stage curtains. Director's thoughts \\"My most immediate and radical lesson came from what was my first blunder, Herakles. It was a good thing to have made this little film first ‚Äì rather than jump into something much more meaningful to me ‚Äì because from that moment on I had a much better idea as to how I should go about my business. Learning from your mistakes is the only real way to learn.\\" \\"For my first film Herakles I needed a good amount of cash, relatively speaking, because I wanted to start shooting in 35 mm and not 16 mm. For me filmmaking was only 35 mm; everything else seemed amateurish. 35 mm had the capacity to demonstrate, more than anything else, whether or not I had anything to offer, and when I started out I thought to myself, 'If I fail, I will fail so hard that I will never recover.'\\" \\"Looking back on Herakles today, I find the film rather stupid and pointless, though at the time it was an important test for me. It taught me about editing together very diverse material that would not normally sit comfortably as a whole. For the film I took stock footage of an accident at Le Mans where something like eighty people died after fragments of a car flew into the spectators' stand, and inter-cut it with footage of bodybuilders, including Mr. Germany 1962. For me it was fascinating to edit material together that had such separate and individual lives. The film was some kind of an apprenticeship for me. I just felt it would be better to make a film than go to film school.\\" References  External links  * Category:1962 films Category:1962 short films Category:German short films Category:West German films Category:German black- and-white films Category:German-language films Category:Films about Heracles Category:Bodybuilding films Category:1962 directorial debut films ","title":"Herakles (film)"},{"id":"8087346","text":"Rolf Aamot (born in Bergen on 28 September 1934) is a Norwegian painter, film director, photographer and tonal-imagePublished by The Bergen Museum of Art 1998: Electromagnetic energy shapes the colour/photone and curvilineartone span of tonal image art.

Since the 1950s, Aamot has been a pioneer within the field of electronic painting, exploring the emerging technology as it combines with the traditional arts of painting, music, film, theatre, and ballet. Aamot studied painting at the Oslo National Academy of the Arts (Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry and Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts), and film at Dramatiska Institutet in Stockholm. Aamot is known for his work as a painter, electronic painter, art photographer, graphic artist, film director, tonal-image composer and cultural author.Kunstnernes Informasjonskontor (Artists Information Office) Much of his work consists of creating electronic tonal images and thus his work contains elements of photography but is hard to pigeon hole. It is frequently a form of performance art with abstract photographic elements. Since 1966, Aamot's works have been displayed in Scandinavia, France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, the Soviet Union and subsequently Russia, Poland, United States and Japan. His work can be found in several important public collections. Aamot has been represented at several international film and art festivals throughout the world.Kunstnernes Informasjonskontor (Artists Information Office)Rolf Aamot - CV (in English) Background Aamot was, from a very early age, taught after Bauhaus principles by his father Randulf Aamot, a master carpenter and wood carver. In 1952, he had his first solo exhibit of paintings at the Paus Knudsen Gallery in Bergen. In 1953, at the age of 18, while still attending the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry in Oslo, he was awarded a major public commission for the Natural History Museum at the University of Oslo.Translation of part of article (with one illustration of Rolf Aamot's frescoes at the Natural History Museum in Oslo) in La Lettre de l'OCIM n¬∞ 77: 'The frescoes in the Paleontological Museum in Oslo - a special case'. In 1955 [sic] (competition 1953, frescoes finished 1955) a young student at the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry, Rolf Aamot, was chosen, by means of a competition, to paint dinosaurs and other creatures of the Secondary (Mesozoic) Era on the walls of the museum. These paintings were originally meant to be an as exact reconstruction as possible, following the scientific advice of the paleontologist Anatol Heintz. Aamot's initial drawings were practically \\"naturalist reconstructions\\" but the artist were to let them evolve into a painting of \\"the soul of the dinosaurs\\". When contemplating these frescoes today the visitor experiences the same sensations as when facing any other work of art. These dinosaurs are first of all what the artist wanted to create, before being \\"representations\\". Rolf Aamot's frescoes are the testimony of an artist on a scientific subject. Emmanuelle Huet, Des dinosaures en repr√©sentation. From 1957 until 1960 he studied at the Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts with the painters Aage Storstein and Alexander Schultz, both of them firmly anchored in the effort to combine figuration and abstraction typical of the 1920s. He later studied Film at the Dramatic Institute in Stockholm. Electronic art in television Aamot's electronic tonal-image work \\"Evolution\\" (1966) with music by Arne Nordheim was shown on Norwegian television in 1967.Image of article from the Norwegian publication Programbladet (28 May - 3 June, Nr. 22, 1967)Image of article from the Norwegian publication Programbladet at Rolf Aamot on Luminous-Lint \\"Evolution\\" represented a milestone of a new art form in which television for the first time was used as an independent picture-artistic means of expression.Luminous-Lint biographical articleNorsk biografisk leksikon (Norwegian biography encyclopedia), 1999-2005 band 10 Throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s Aamot created a series of works for television. Video art and digital photopaintings Aamot became a controversial artist in the 1960s and 1970s. From the latter half of the 1980s, he worked with computer paintings on canvas, digital photopaintings and graphic art. He has continued to make video and film art, often in collaboration with the painter and composer Bj√∏rg L√∏d√∏en and the photographer, dancer and choreographer Kristin Lodoen Linder.

Strollo (June 18, 1899 ‚Äì disappeared April 8, 1962), also known as \\"Tony Bender\\", was a New York mobster who served as a high-ranking capo of the Genovese crime family for several decades. Biography Early years Anthony Strollo was born in New York City, the son of Calabrian immigrants Leone and Giovannina Nigro. Strollo grew up in Manhattan near the Manhattan Bridge. Strollo had two brothers, Emilio and Dominick. He married a woman named Edna Goldenberg, who bore him several children. Strollo was a cousin of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania mobster Lenny Strollo and Dante Strollo, a member of the Youngstown, Ohio, Cosa Nostra family. Strollo was of medium height and weight with sandy brown hair. Associates described him as usually having a doleful look. Strollo's legitimate job was that of a real estate salesman. During Prohibition, Strollo gained a formidable reputation as a bootlegger and hitman. In the early to mid-1920s, Strollo worked for gang boss Giuseppe \\"Joe the Boss\\" Masseria. After the Castellammarese War began in 1931, Strollo defected to Masseria's rival, Salvatore Maranzano, and become a trusted lieutenant and gunman. Luciano regime Following the death of Maranzano, Strollo joined the Luciano crime family, headed by boss Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano. Strollo became a capo for Luciano and underboss Vito Genovese. Strollo assumed control of the Greenwich Village Crew, operating illegal gambling in New York's Greenwich Village and Lower Manhattan districts. On June 18, 1936, boss Luciano was sentenced to 30 to 50 years in prison on a pandering charge, making underboss Vito Genovese the acting boss. Genovese designated Strollo as his underboss. Costello regime In 1937, facing a probable murder indictment, Genovese fled to Italy. Genovese wanted Strollo to keep control of the family for him, but Genovese's rival, Frank Costello, took over as acting boss and designated Willie Moretti as underboss. In 1946, after being extradited from Italy to the United States and escaping indictment, Genovese returned to the family as a capo with Strollo as his assistant. Strollo supervised Genovese's rackets in Greenwich Village and the New Jersey waterfront for the next ten years. Strollo successfully operated a string of Greenwich Village nightclubs, including the popular Black Cat, the Hollywood, the 19th Hole (some say Christopher \\"Christy Tick\\" Furnari of the Lucchese crime family ran the 19th Hole), and the Village Inn. On December 17, 1952, Strollo was summoned to testify at the New York State Crime Commission hearings. He was an uncooperative witness, claiming either a bad memory or refusing to testify based on his Fifth Amendment right under the U.S. Constitution against self-incrimination. Genovese regime In 1957, Strollo assisted Genovese in planning an assassination attempt on Frank Costello. On the day of the murder attempt, Strollo met with Costello in the late afternoon and learned his itinerary for the evening. Strollo then passed that information on to Genovese's hitman. Although Costello was only slightly wounded in the attack, he immediately retired from the family and passed the leadership to Genovese. Genovese now ran what is today known as the Genovese crime family. In 1959, Strollo changed loyalties again and joined in a conspiracy against Genovese. After a secret meeting with Gambino crime family boss Carlo Gambino, Strollo allegedly participated in a plot to set up Genovese on a drug trafficking conviction. In 1959, Genovese was sent to prison for 15 years on narcotics trafficking charges. The imprisoned Genovese now allegedly decided to kill Strollo. One theory is that Genovese learned that Strollo had betrayed him. However, a second theory states that Strollo had cheated Genovese of tribute from a drug operation. Disappearance On the morning of April 8, 1962, Strollo disappeared after leaving his residence in Fort Lee, New Jersey. His remains were never recovered and no one was ever charged in his disappearance. When government witness Joseph Valachi later visited Genovese in prison, Genovese allegedly hinted at responsibility for Strollo's murder.

The nearest railway station is at Nuneaton. The northern parish boundary is a little south of the A5 trunk road known as Watling Street which is also the county boundary at this point between Warwickshire and Leicestershire. The northern boundary is marked by the Soar Brook which divides it from nearby Stretton Baskerville. The boundary to west and south is with Nuneaton, Bulkington, and Wolvey and the River Anker. The eastern boundary follows the road from Wolvey to Hinckley. A branch of the Coventry Canal system, known as the Ashby de la Zouch Canal passes through the west of the parish. The name derives from the Hastings family who held the manor until 1529. Burton Hastings is often used by commuters who work in nearby towns.

A notable language in which this is a fairly common paradigm is C++. C# does not support return type covariance; however it has been set out to be added as new language feature as of upcoming C# 9.0. Covariant return types have been (partially) allowed in the Java language since the release of JDK5.0,bridge Methods were introduced to circumvent problems introduced by polymorphism and the new generic type erasure so the following example wouldn't compile on a previous release: // Classes used as return types: class A { } class B extends A { } // \\"Class B is narrower than class A\\" // Classes demonstrating method overriding: class C { A getFoo() { return new A(); } } class D extends C { //Overriding getFoo() in parent class C B getFoo() { return new B(); } } More specifically, covariant (wide to narrower) or contravariant (narrow to wider) return type refers to a situation where the return type of the overriding method is changed to a type related to (but different from) the return type of the original overridden method. The relationship between the two covariant return types is usually one which allows substitution of the one type with the other, following the Liskov substitution principle.

Biography After taking control of the social organization Ragen's Athletic and Benevolent Association with his brother Frank Ragen in the late 1890s, later known as Ragen's Colts, Ragen would soon become involved in the gang's usual activities including political intimidation, labor slugging and particularly bootlegging during Prohibition. A veteran of Chicago's \\"circulation wars\\" during the 1910s, Ragen would work under Moses Annenberg with other future Chicago mobsters such as Maurice Enright, Walter Stevens and Peter Gentleman in \\"bootjacking\\" or forcing downtown newspaper stands to sell Chicago American. By the early 1930s, Ragen had begun overseeing the day to day office operations for the Nationwide News Service (then known as the General News Service), the sole distributors of racetrack and other gambling results nationwide, under the control of Moses Annenberg. An invaluable source of revenue for legal and illegal gambling alike, the organization was highly sought after among organized crime leaders throughout the decade. Faced with pressure from the Chicago Outfit and the Roosevelt administration, who sought to charge Annenberg with anti-trust and income tax evasion charges Annenberg was eventually forced by Democratic political opponents to sell the National News Service to Ragen on November 15, 1939. Ragen however, continued to fend off strong arm tactics of Tony Accardo, Murray Humphreys and Jake Guzik in their attempts to pressure Ragen to sell to the Chicago Outfit. After initial attempts to intimidate Ragen failed, the syndicate began a rival news service based in California, Trans-American Publishing, under the control of Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel (where bookies were forced to pay up to a daily $100 subscription fee). Another competing syndicate news service, Dan Serritella's Blue Scratch Sheet, was also established in Chicago, however, it soon went out of business. The failure of these news services convinced syndicate leaders to take the National News Service by force. Fearing for his life, Ragen confided in the spring of 1946 in his friend, newspaper reporter and syndicated columnist, Drew Pearson. Pearson took the information he received from Ragen related to the activities and the structure of organized crime in Chicago to his friend, U.S. Attorney General Tom C. Clark and asked Clark for FBI protection for Ragen. In the years that followed, Pearson reported several times on the events leading to Ragen's death and in Pearson's October 26, 1963 column titled, \\"'Songbird' Was Murdered\\" he reports that Tom C. Clark had assigned twelve FBI agents provide protection to Ragen in 1946 while they interrogated him in Chicago. After the FBI fact checked Ragen's statements to them, Tom Clark confirmed to Pearson that the facts learned from Ragen were true and the top echelon of the Chicago mob \\"led to very high places.\\" The names of seemingly respected politicians and businessmen revealed by Ragen to the FBI were words familiar to every Chicago household and some believed they had reformed, but Pearson wrote, \\"Yet they still controlled the mob.\\" Pearson added that Tom C. Clark's Justice Department had no federal jurisdiction to prosecute the suspects Ragen named and after completing their questioning of Ragen and verifying his claims, the FBI withdrew their protection of him. Pearson wrote in his diary: \\"The FBI interviewed Ragen at great length. They brought back a multitude of tips, leads, and evidence. Tom Clark told me afterward that it led to very high places. J. Edgar Hoover intimated the same thing. He said the people Ragen pointed to had now reformed. I learned later that it pointed to the Hilton hotel chain; Henry Crown, the big Jewish financier in Chicago; and Walter Annenberg, publisher of the Philadelphia Inquirer.\\" While driving down State Street, Ragen was ambushed at Pershing Road and was seriously wounded in the arms and legs by a shotgun blast from syndicate gunman on June 24, 1946. Taken to a nearby hospital, Ragen signed an affidavit identifying the gunman before his death on August 15, following a mysteriously administered dose of mercury. The affidavit was lost however when State Attorney William Touhy was unable to prosecute against those named by Ragen. References Further reading *English, T.J.

Early years Shapiro was born in 1899 in Odessa in the Russian Empire. While confined in protectory in Brooklyn, he became friends with Joseph Valachi and Jimmy \\"The Shiv\\" DeStefano (who got his nickname while confined in the protectory). Legs Diamond was also there but kept his distance from the feared threesome. During this period, Shapiro encountered his future partner, Louis Buchalter; both boys were attempting to rob the same pushcart. Instead of fighting over the spoils, Shapiro and Buchalter agreed on a partnership. Buchalter served as the brains and Shapiro provided the muscle in an alliance that lasted for decades. Shapiro and Buchalter soon become acquainted with future mobsters Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano, both of whom were prot√©g√©s of mobster Arnold Rothstein. Labor slugger Encouraged by Rothstein; Shapiro and Buchalter entered the lucrative arena of New York labor racketeering working for Jacob Orgen. Orgen had previously wrested control of this racket from Nathan Kaplan in the decade-long Labor Slugger Wars. The gangsters had infiltrated labor unions in the busy Garment District, Manhattan, assaulting and murdering the union leadership to gain control. The gangsters then instituted a system of kickbacks and skimming from union dues while at the same time extorting the garment manufacturers with the threat of strikes. After working for Orgen for a while, Shapiro and Buchalter started planning to take over his operations. Realizing that Shapiro and Buchalter posed a threat, Orgen allied himself with brothers Eddie and \\"Legs\\" Diamond. Shapiro and Buchalter soon made their move. On October 15, 1927, Orgen and Jack Diamond were standing on the corner of Delancey and Norfolk Street in the Lower East Side. Two gunmen (thought to be Shapiro and Buchalter) drove up to the corner. One gunman got out of the car and started shooting while the driver began shooting from the inside the car. Orgen was killed instantly and Jack Diamond was severely wounded. With Orgen's death, Shapiro and Buchalter took over his labor racketing operation. The two partners soon began massive extortions of both labor unions and businesses as they created a massive criminal monopoly in the Garment District. Murder, Inc. Although the pair are thought to have started Murder Inc., the enterprise was already thriving when the pair became one of their top clients next to the \\"National Crime Syndicate\\", a confederation of crime families created by Luciano and Lansky in 1929. The Syndicate was created to avoid the bloody gang wars of the 1920s by creating an organization with the power to mediate organized crime disputes and punish offenders. Murder, Inc. served as the enforcement arm for the Syndicate. Government pressure A November 1937 FBI wanted poster for Shapiro and Buchalter. During the early 1930s, US Attorney Thomas E. Dewey started to prosecute organized crime members in New York City. The pressure created by Dewey was such that in 1935 mobster Dutch Schultz asked the National Crime Syndicate to approve Dewey's murder. Shapiro and Anastasia agreed with Schultz, but Buchalter and the rest of the Syndicate turned down his request. Killing a prosecutor went against mob tradition, the majority argued, and would only increase federal investigation into organized crime and possibly expose the Syndicate itself. In fact, the Syndicate was so fearful of Schultz's proposal that they later ordered Buchalter to murder Schultz. On October 23, 1935, Schultz and several associates were gunned down by Murder, Inc. gunmen in a restaurant in Newark, New Jersey. Shortly after Schultz's death, Shapiro and Buchalter became the focus of Dewey's investigations. In October, 1936, Shapiro and Buchalter were convicted under the terms of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and were both sentenced to two years in Sing Sing Prison. After his conviction, Shapiro went into hiding for a year. However, he finally turned himself in to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents on April 14, 1938 and was sent to prison. On May 5, 1944, Shapiro was convicted of conspiracy and extortion and sentenced to 15 years to life in prison. Months before his 1944 conviction, Shapiro allegedly smuggled a note to Buchalter, who was then on trial in New York for murder. The note simply read, \\"I told you so.\\" On March 4, 1944, Buchalter was electrocuted in Sing Sing Prison in Ossining, New York. Until his death in prison from a heart attack in 1947, Shapiro remained convinced that had Dewey been killed, he and others would have remained free. Further reading *Block, Alan A.

In 1971 he was elected to a Fellowship of the British Academy. He was editor of the Cambridge Law Journal from 1973-74. He died in February 1974, aged 51. During the 1960s he served on a part-time basis as Constitutional Commissioner for Mauritius. He drafted its constitution at the time the country attained independence on 12 March 1968. His work for Mauritius is commemorated by a memorial in the Pamplemousses Botanical Gardens; his ashes were scattered in that country.  Publications  De Smith's research and writing in the field of constitutional law focused in particular on the constitutional problems of developing countries: his advice in this area was frequently sought by the United Kingdom and other governments, and his work led to the publication of The New Commonwealth and its Constitutions in 1964, and after a stay as visiting fellow at the Center for International Studies and as visiting professor at the Law School of New York University, of Microstates and Micronesia in 1970. To the end of his career he continued to be active as a consultant upon the constitutional problems of emergent states and nations. A second area of interest was administrative law. From the publication in 1959 of the first edition of Judicial Review of Administrative Action, his reputation rapidly became established. He produced two further editions of this work in 1968 and 1973. A fourth edition was prepared in 1980 by Professor John M. Evans.

Those that knew him will remember him as a somewhat reserved person with a quiet sense of humour, though they will not have known that the appearance of reserve was the result of deafness caused by his artillery service in the war; he was invariably encouraging to his students and younger colleagues and he was generous in his assessment of others\\".

It was the first of five studio albums the band would record for Lookout!, and their first by the lineup of singer and guitarist \\"Joe Queer\\" King, bassist Chris \\"B-Face\\" Barnard, and drummer Hugh O'Neill. It was also their first collaboration with Screeching Weasel frontman Ben Weasel, who produced the album and co-wrote two of its songs (he would also produce the band's next two studio efforts, and co-wrote a number of songs with King which were used on later Queers and Screeching Weasel records), and the first of three Queers albums recorded at Sonic Iguana Studio in Lafayette, Indiana with audio engineer Mass Giorgini, who would continue to work with the band on and off for the next 14 years as a producer and engineer. Love Songs for the Retarded became the Queers' highest- selling album, with sales surpassing 100,000 copies. After the Queers rescinded their master recordings from Lookout! in 2006, Love Songs for the Retarded was reissued by Asian Man Records the following year, having been remixed and remastered by Giorgini. Background The Queers had gone through a number of lineup changes and periods of inactivity before the lineup of singer, songwriter, and guitarist \\"Joe Queer\\" King, drummer Hugh O'Neill, and bassist Chris \\"B-Face\\" Barnard solidified in 1990. By 1991 King was co-owner of a caf√© and bar in Exeter, New Hampshire called Joe's Place, where O'Neill and Barnard worked as dishwashers. Around this time King befriended Ben Weasel, whose band Screeching Weasel soon signed to Berkeley, California-based Lookout! Records. The Queers' goals at the time were modest: \\"Things were desperate\\", King later recalled, \\"I made no money to speak of. We just wanted to do one great punk rock album that we'd release ourselves and play with Screeching Weasel at least once.\\" To this end, in May 1991 the band recorded a 14-song demo tape of new material to send to Weasel (9 of these songs would be recorded for Love Songs for the Retarded, while 3 more would be recorded for 1994's Beat Off; the entire demo tape was later included on the 1999 compilation album Later Days and Better Lays). Upon listening to the band's new songs, Weasel suggested to Lookout! head Larry Livermore that he sign the Queers to the label, and convinced King to send Livermore a copy of the demo. \\"The songs were irresistibly melodic;\\" Livermore recalled in his 2015 memoir, \\"a couple of the slower numbers, heavily influenced by doo-wop and the Beach Boys, were almost heartbreakingly beautiful. Joe King was ten years younger than me, but we'd obviously grown up listening to a lot of the same music.\\" He felt the demo was almost good enough to put out itself, but thought it worth getting the band into a studio to re-record it with better production. He contacted King at Joe's Place and offered to sign the Queers to Lookout!: \\"My cook Don answered the phone and said it was Larry Livermore\\", King recalled in 2014. \\"I of course knew what that meant‚Äîthough I'd never spoken to him‚Äîand he asked if we wanted to do a record with them because he liked our songs.\\" King asked Weasel to serve as record producer, and Livermore traveled to Chicago to meet the Queers, who were staying there with Weasel. Livermore was pleased to find that he got along well with the band, especially King, who shared Weasel's fondness for wisecracks and stories but was easier-going, less cynical and acerbic. With Weasel already having assured King that Lookout! was reliable when it came to paying its bands, a deal was quickly struck. Recording Love Songs for the Retarded was the first Queers album recorded with Mass Giorgini (pictured in 1996), who would work on six more of their studio albums. Love Songs for the Retarded was recorded in November 1992 with audio engineer Mass Giorgini at his Sonic Iguana Studio in Lafayette, Indiana, where Screeching Weasel had recorded their album Wiggle that summer. King, B-Face, and King's roommate Harlan rented a cargo van and drove over 1,000 miles from the band's hometown of Portsmouth, New Hampshire to Chicago, meeting up with Livermore, Weasel, and Screeching Weasel guitarist Dan Vapid to head south to Lafayette. O'Neill, who was flying out from Boston, missed his flight and did not arrive to the studio until the afternoon of recording. According to the album's liner notes, the recording session lasted from 9:30 PM on Saturday, November 7 to 9:30 PM the following day \\"with about five hours in between for an uneasy slumber\\". At the time, the Queers were heavy drinkers and regular drug users. B-Face later recalled \\"We partied like crazy. It's all I knew‚ÄîI had no idea there were other punk bands that weren't like us [...] Lord knows Joe and Hugh did [...] I generally just stuck to booze, although I got my first taste of hard drugs from those guys.\\" This party lifestyle followed them into the studio, as Livermore recalled: \\"If you've seen the [album] cover photo‚Äîa bleary-eyed band surrounded by a staggering array of bottles‚Äîyou'll have some idea what the recording session looked like [...] I was tempted to say something as I helped unload cases of Budweiser along with the band's signature bass cabinet with its spray-painted slogan, 'THE QUEERS ARE HERE'. But I kept my mouth shut [...] Ben had the sense to go easy on his own drinking, and Mass didn't drink at all, but a couple band members were on the way to being completely blotto by the time we were done setting up the mics.\\" Nevertheless, he found that the band was so well-rehearsed that their intoxication hardly affected their performance, the songs flowing almost effortlessly while Giorgini worked eagerly and Weasel kept everyone on task: \\"Ben was determined to crank out [the album] in two days flat. He approached it the same way he had [Screeching Weasel's 1991 album] My Brain Hurts: one or two takes and done for nearly every song [...] It helped immensely, too, that the band came in with a fully developed and rehearsed set of songs. In all my years working with the Queers, it was the only time that would happen.\\" King similarly recalled the session going swiftly, but felt that the material on the demo tape was better in some respects because the band had been more relaxed and not as rushed as they were during the album session: \\"We busted out all the songs and the next day [O'Neill] few out around 2 PM. I did vocals and we banged it out quick. It was fun, though all of us in the Queers knew we could have done better at home. Still, if Lookout was paying for it we were honored to go do it. Ben was a real inspiration, as even then I highly respected his songwriting.\\" Weasel shares writing credit with King on two of the album's tracks, \\"Fuck the World\\" and \\"I Can't Stop Farting\\". A version of \\"Fuck the World\\" recorded by Screeching Weasel was later included on the 2005 reissue of Wiggle. \\"I Can't Stand You\\" was written by Ron Nole, aka Ronnie Parasite, of the New Jersey punk band the Parasites. Though uncredited, Livermore and the others at the studio performed gang vocals on the album, including the songs \\"You're Tripping\\" and \\"I Hate Everything\\". To his disappointment, Livermore \\"couldn't quite nail\\" the backing vocals on \\"Debra Jean\\", despite having practiced the song for weeks in advance. King's roommate Harlan performed the guitar lead on \\"Night of the Livid Queers\\". B-Face did the artwork and layout for the LP sleeve and insert, to which Lookout's Chris Appelgren added illustrations including a \\"borrowed\\" Felix the Cat comic strip in which Felix demonstrates the five senses by getting drunk, and an image of Felix playing the banjo from the 1927 Educational Pictures feature Uncle Tom's Crabbin'; Appelgren later developed this into the \\"Queers cat\\", a character he included in the artwork of several of the band's subsequent releases.Prested, p. 97. He also adapted B-Face's layout for the compact disc release of the album. Reception Reviewing Love Songs for the Retarded for Allmusic, Kembrew McLeod rated it 4 stars out of 5 and said that \\"most of the album alternates between the guitar-driven pure pop craft of 'Daydreaming' and the less melodic, raging punk of 'Monster Zero'. It is, nonetheless, a giant leap from their first album, Grow Up.\\" Critic Robert Christgau gave the album an honorable mention, summarizing that \\"for 16 songs in 36 minutes, they [heart] Ramones and rhyme with 'beers'.\\" Reissue In 2006 the Queers followed several other former Lookout! artists in rescinding their master tapes and licensing rights from the label, invoking a clause in their contract citing delinquent royalty payments.Prested, p. 191. They signed to Asian Man Records, who reissued all of the band's Lookout! albums in 2007, each having been remixed and remastered by Giorgini at Sonic Iguana. For its reissue, Love Songs for the Retarded was given new artwork derived from the original LP release. This version of the album was re-released in 2017 by Rad Girlfriend Records.

Biography Born in Romania, Rosenzweig arrived in New York during the 1890s and worked as a tailor's presser for several years before forming a criminal gang around 1907. Controlling labor slugging in New York's Lower East Side, Rosenzweig's organization of around one hundred acted mostly as strikebreakers, specializing in breaking up union picket lines, demonstrations and other protests. With political protection from Tammany Hall Rosenzweig maintained complete control of strikebreaking and labor slugging well into the early 1910s. Rosenzweig's dominance was challenged in 1913, when Philip \\"Pinchey\\" Paul began a war with Rosenzweig, lasting over several months. The war ended with Paul's death the following year, when he was killed by Rosenzweig and several gunmen, including Jacob Heiseman, Benjamin Snyder and Hyman Berthstein. When he was later arrested for the murder Rosenzweig agreed to testify against the other gang members. Despite his testimony Rosenzweig was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, along with Snyder, to Sing Sing Prison in December 1915. Upon Rosenzweig's release in 1925 he returned to Manhattan to find his gang had long since disappeared. After he received a warning from ex- lieutenant Waxey Gordon against attempting to reform his gang he soon left New York retiring from crime thereafter. Further reading *Fried, Albert.

According to Zunz, his surname is derived from the Spanish town Zarza (= \\"thorn-bush\\"), and is accordingly synonymous with the Hebrew \\"seneh.\\" Of his life no details are known, for while in his notes on the Sefer ha-Yu·∏•asin (ed. Filipowski, p. 226) Samuel Shullam states that Zarza was burned at the stake by the tribunal of Valencia on the denunciation of Isaac Campanton, who accused him of denying the creation of the world, historians have proved this assertion a mere legend.David Kaufmann, \\"Shullam's Report of the Burning of Samuel Zarza: A Legend Based on a Name\\" The Jewish Quarterly Review, Vol. 11, No. 4 (Jul., 1899), pp. 658-662. Zarza's main activity was in the 1360s and 1370s; Campanton was born in 1360. Although a comparatively unimportant writer, if his two works may serve as a criterion, Zarza ranked high in the estimation of his contemporaries, so that the poet Solomon Reubeni of Barcelona and the astronomer Isaac ibn Al-·∏§adib (in 1377) composed poems in his honor. Zarza was the author of the Me·∏≥or ·∏§ayyim, a philosophical commentary on the Pentateuch (1368; printed Mantua, 1559), and of the Miklol Yofi, a philosophical commentary devoted to the haggadot found in both Talmudim and divided into 151 chapters and seven parts (Neubauer, Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS. No. 1296). In the introduction to the latter work Zarza draws a melancholy picture of the state of the Jews of Castile in his time, stating that in Toledo alone 10,000 perished in the course of the war between Peter of Castile and his half brother Henry II of Castile. In his Me·∏≥or ·∏§ayyim, Zarza mentions four other writings of his which are no longer in existence: ·π¨aharat ha-·∏≤odesh, on the principles of religion, E·∫ìem ha-Dat, ·∫íeror ha-Mor, and Magen Abraham.

Jacopo was Bishop of Paphos, in Cyprus, and had been named commander of the papal fleet by the Borgia pope, Alexander VI. This painting recalls one of Titian's earliest paintings Jacopo Pesaro being presented by Pope Alexander VI to Saint Peter, c. 1510-11, text. Aesthetics Titian shows his patron in a devotional pose, kneeling before the Virgin and presented to her by Saint Peter. Prominently displayed on the step is Saint Peter's key; its diagonal plane, leading toward the Virgin, parallels that of Jacopo. The Virgin's position at the top of the steps alludes to her celestial role as Madonna della Scala (Madonna of the Stairs) and as the Stairway to Heaven. Titian actually used his wife, who died in childbirth soon after, as the model for the Virgin Mary in this work.Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, Venice, accessed March 11, 2013 The large red banner at the far left prominently displays the papal arms in the center and those of Jacopo below. Also displayed is a laurel branch, a symbol of victory. An unidentified knight has two prisoners in tow, a turbaned Turk and a Moor, probably a reference to Jacopo's victory over the Turks in 1502. At the right, Saint Francis of Assisi links the five kneeling Pesaro family members to Christ, suggesting that through his own route of identification with Christ salvation can be achieved. Just behind Saint Francis is Saint Anthony of Padua - both, like Saint Bernardino, are Franciscans, as is the church of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari. The members of the donor's family are motionless. All the other figures gesture energetically and occupy diagonal planes. The steps, surmounted by large columns cut off at the top, are thrust diagonally back into space. Infant angels appear on the cloud above. One seen in rear view holds the Cross. The back of this angel is juxtaposed with the infant Christ, who turns playfully on Mary's lap and looks down at Saint Francis, who returns his gaze. The fabrics are characteristically rich and textured, particularly the flag and costumes. This attention to material textures is further enhanced by the variation of bright lights and dark accents in the sky. The light of Venice, sparkling in its waterways, seems to illuminate this painting. Composition When Titian painted this altarpiece, he broke with a centuries-long tradition of placing the devotional figures (the Virgin and Child) in the center of the painting and the painted space. By doing this, he allowed for a greater sense of movement through the painting, presaging the Baroque period's more complicated compositional techniques. The painting is particularly innovative and shows an example of developed High-Renaissance style, as Titian has used diagonal and triangular principles to draw the viewer's eye up to the Madonna and Child, thus creating hierarchy within the work and shows that the Pesaro family are pious. The architectural setting, involving the two large columns (which have been cropped to fit the altarpiece) draw emphasis vertically and to the height of the work; which draws the eye Heavenwards. These columns in the center of the painting are unprecedented in Renaissance painting, and are the subject of some controversy. X-rays reveal that Titian painted several other architectural elements in their place before settling on the columns. Some critics have even speculated that Titian did not paint the columns.Titian: Madonna di Ca‚Äô Pesaro, Venice an online exhibit, the University of Mary Washington. Accessed March 11, 2013 The outdoors setting suggests that the activity is taking place in a portico, in which the grandeur of the columns somehow belittles the human beings which leave the figures and the viewer almost in awe of the greater implied force.  Removal and Restoration  Following the May 2012 earthquakes in Northern Italy, Titian's painting was removed from view and began a lengthy conservation treatment funded by the non-profit organization Save Venice Inc. While the painting was being conserved, a replica photograph was displayed in the church. On September 21, 2017, more than 400 people attended a ceremony celebrating the re-installation of Titian's restored altarpiece.

George Hyde Chambers (23 October 1803 ‚Äì 29 October 1840) was an English marine painter. Life and work Chambers was born in a poor working-class area of Whitby, Yorkshire, the second son of a seaman; his mother took in lodgers. At the age of 8 years, he was working on the coal sloops in the town harbour. At the age of 10, he served as a cabin boy on a coasting vessel, and was afterwards apprenticed to the master of a brig trading in the Mediterranean and Baltic. He proved to have an innate talent for art, and so impressed local captains and crews with his decoration of their ships, that the ship-owner released him from his apprenticeship so that he could devote himself full-time to painting.Hemming, Charles British Painters of Coast and Sea : A History and Gazetteer Gollancz 1988 p.17 Returning to Whitby, he took up employment as a house painter and took lessons in drawing in his spare time. Chambers worked his way on a trading vessel to London in 1825, where he was greatly helped by Christopher Crawford, formerly of Whitby, but then landlord of the Waterman's Arms at Wapping. His work, hanging in the gentlemen's parlour of the inn, proved popular with its nautical clientele and won Chambers his early commissions, although he also worked as a scene-painter (1827‚Äì28) on Thomas Hornor‚Äôs Panorama of London at the London Colosseum in Regent's Park, and at the Pavilion Theatre, Whitechapel (1830‚Äì31). In 1829, two of his pictures were purchased by Admiral Thomas Capel who drew his merits to the attention of other officers including Admiral Lord Mark Kerr. The latter in turn secured him the patronage of King William IV and Queen Adelaide in 1831‚Äì32 and thereafter Chambers was an established artist. He only showed three works at the Royal Academy 1828‚Äì29 and 1838, but many more at the British Institution, 1827‚Äì40, the Society of British Artists 1829‚Äì38 and the Old Water-colour Society, 1834‚Äì40, of which he was elected member in 1834. Chambers was a talented draughtsman and watercolourist and an accomplished painter in oils, often working with fluent, colourful bravura in such views as A Fresh Breeze off Cowes and A Dutch Boier in a Fresh Breeze (National Maritime Museum, Greenwich), the latter a product of his one substantial artistic tour to the Netherlands in 1837. His most important later ‚Äòset-piece‚Äô commission was Bombardment of Algiers, 1816 by Lord Exmouth, commissioned by the admiral's friends for the Naval Gallery at Greenwich Hospital in 1836 (and now in the National Maritime Museum) probably through the agency of E.H. Locker of the Hospital, Exmouth's former secretary. He also painted two other pictures for the Gallery. Chambers‚Äô career was hampered by personal diffidence in promoting himself and, when he began to succeed, cut short by chronic ill health. A voyage to Madeira in the summer of 1840 failed to bring improvements and he died of heart failure at Brighton on 29 October 1840. He left a widow and three children. His two sons, George William Crawford Chambers (1829‚Äì1878) and William Henry Chambers (1834-1890) were also marine painters. His younger brother, Thomas, became a marine and landscape painter in the United States. References Further reading *Colin Bullamore. Scarborough and Whitby Water-Colourists (Colin P.

Contents The Gingerbread Lady (1971), (books.google.ca), Samuel French, Inc., , pp. ii-iv It proved to be one of Simon's least successful plays on Broadway. Stapleton won the 1971 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. In the UK, the play premiered at the Theatre Royal Windsor on June 25, 1974 with Elaine Stritch in the lead, and Vivien Merchant, Kevin Lindsay, Stephen Greif and Jenny Quayle in support.'Out of Town', The Stage 20 June 1974 The production belatedly transferred to the Phoenix Theatre in London's West End on October 23, with Merchant and Greif replaced by Sarah Marshall and Blain Fairman. Like the Broadway version, this one ran for just over five months.R B Marriott, 'Plays in Performance: The Gingerbread Lady at the Phoenix', The Stage 31 October 1974 The play was revived by the Equity Library Theater (New York City) in 1987. Plot overview A major departure from Simon's previous lighthearted plays, The Gingerbread Lady was a dark drama with comic overtones centering on Evy Meara, a cabaret singer whose career, marriage, and health all have been destroyed by alcohol. Alvin Klein noted that \\"The play was Mr. Simon's first attempt to play it straight and serious.\\"Klein, Alvin. \\"Theater in Review; 'Gingerbread Lady' Lacks Spice\\" The New York Times, December 20, 1981 Having just completed a ten-week stint in a rehab facility to overcome her addiction, she returns home to the welcome of friends with their own problems. These include Toby, an overly vain woman who fears the loss of her looks and Jimmy, a gay actor in danger of losing a part in a play, her devoted but anxious teenaged daughter, and a worthless ex- lover. Evy's efforts at hosting a party crumble when she falls off the wagon and careens toward a tragic end. Film In 1981, Simon adapted his play as a film with the title Only When I Laugh, starring his then-wife Marsha Mason in the lead role.\\" 'Only When I Laugh' listing\\" Internet Movie Database, accessed April 10, 2012 According to Susan Fehrenbacher Koprince (associate professor of English at the University of North Dakota, Grand Forks), the film \\"is radically changed\\" from the play, and used \\"less than half\\" of the play. For example, the former nightclub singer Evy becomes Georgia, \\"a divorced actress who is battling alcoholism as she struggles to establish a closer relationship with her daughter.\\" Georgia, unlike Evy, is not a nymphomaniac and is not as self-destructive. Koprince concludes that the optimistic ending for the film is \\"more plausible\\" than the \\"tacked-on happy ending to the play\\".Koprince, Fehrenbacher Susan. \\"Chapter:Movie Adaptations of Simon's Plays\\" Understanding Neil Simon (2002), (books.google.com), Univ of South Carolina, , pp. 154‚Äì155 Reception According to Thomas S.

He held the post of Chairman of Becta (a government agency, funded by the Department for Children, Schools and Families which oversees the e-strategy for Education and supports information and communications technology (ICT) and e-learning in schools and colleges) from January 2006 to January 2009. He has held many executive posts in the public and private sector relating to IT. Early life Pinder was born in 1947. He was educated at the University of Liverpool from 1969 until 1972 where he received a BA in Economics and Geography.  e-Envoy  Pinder's most high-profile position was as the e-Envoy between October 2000 and August 2004, when he was responsible directly to the Prime Minister for coordinating the development of the knowledge economy in the UK. In this role, he gave a speech at the CBI in November 2001. He oversaw the rapid implementation in 2001 of the Government Gateway, a project for putting all the government services online, which was built by Microsoft in just 15 weeks and initially locked out all browsers except Microsoft's own Internet Explorer. He defended this by claiming that the limitation applied only to the part \\"which allows citizens and businesses to enrol for services. [But] once enrolled, they can submit transactions from any operating system, since XML - the language used - is totally platform independent.\\" The deal also involved Microsoft using UK government intellectual property to build products for other governments in order to recoup some of the costs of building the technology. The rate of return was to the tune of 22% of their gross sales of the intellectual property, which Pinder hoped would \\"give us quite a lot of money\\". This hope was reiterated by a minister for the Cabinet Office as late as January 2003.

Generally  In the past there were conflicts between state schools and Catholic schools (de schoolstrijd), and disputes regarding whether the Catholic schools' should be funded by the government. The 1958 School Pact was an agreement by the three large political parties (the Christian Democratic, Socialist and Liberal parties) to end these conflicts. Due to the federalization of Belgium, education is organised by the three communities since 1989. Since then, the Flemish Government organises education in the Flemish Region as well as in the bilingual Brussels-Capital Region where the Government of the French Community is also responsible. The Flemish Community organises the Dutch-language education but has to provide French-language schools in the 12 municipalities with language facilities within the Flemish Region. The federal level only regulates a few general matters: the start and end of compulsory education (which is between the ages of 6 and 18), the minimal conditions for issuing diplomas, and the pension scheme. Article 24 of the Belgian Constitution furthermore guarantees free education, the right of parents to choose their school and the (philosophical, ideological and religious) neutrality of government-provided schools. These state schools have to provide the choice between the teaching of one of the recognized religions and non-denominational moral teaching.  Networks  Education is organised through three networks. First, there are state schools directly provided by the Flemish government, which is called Gemeenschapsonderwijs (literally \\"community education\\"), stylised as \\"GO!\\", education of the Flemish Community. They are both primary and secondary schools as well as adult education centres. Most secondary schools are commonly named (Koninklijk) Atheneum (\\"(Royal) Atheneum\\"), most of which were built in the 1960s during the schoolstrijd (\\"school struggle\\") in Belgium. One of the oldest athenea is the Royal Atheneum of Antwerp, which exists since 1808. Secondly, there are subsidized public schools (officieel gesubsidieerd onderwijs), which are public schools organized by provinces and municipalities. Those provided by the municipalities are coordinated through the Education Secretariat of the Cities and Municipalities of the Flemish Community (Onderwijssecretariaat van de Steden en Gemeenten van de Vlaamse Gemeenschap; OVSG). This network also includes a few schools organised by the Flemish Community Commission (VGC) in Brussels. Lastly, there are subsidized free schools (vrij gesubsidieerd onderwijs), which is with about 70% of the pupils by far the largest group. They are mainly organized by an organization affiliated to the Catholic Church, organised by Catholic Education Flanders (Katholiek Onderwijs Vlaanderen), formerly known as the Flemish Secretariat of the Catholic Education (Vlaams Secretariaat van het Katholiek Onderwijs; VSKO). Only eight schools are affiliated to the Protestant Church, so-called \\"Schools with the Bible\\".IPCO, Onderwijskoepel van de Scholen met de Bijbel in Vlaanderen en Brussel There are also non-denominational free schools, \\"method schools\\" using e.g. the Steiner, Freinet or Montessori education method. Homeschooling is also legal since \\"learning\\" is mandatory in Belgium as opposed to attending school. Homeschooling is very rare, but the numbers are rising slowly. For the year 2007‚Äî2008 the number of home-schooled children in Flanders rose to 279 in basic education and 504 in secondary education, out of a total of 1.3 million. Levels The different levels of education in Flanders Basic education Basic education (basisonderwijs) consists of optional pre-school (kleuteronderwijs) and six years of mandatory primary education (lager onderwijs). The mandatory education starts on 1 September of the year in which the child has its sixth birthday. Secondary education Secondary education (secundair onderwijs) also consists of six years starting from the age of 12. Secondary school is divided into four general types. Each type consists of a set of different directions that may vary from school to school. The general types are as follows: * General Secondary Education (; ASO. About 40% of all pupils): A very broad, general education, preparing for higher education. * Technical Secondary Education (; TSO. About 30% of all pupils): The TSO is divided into two groups of education again: TTK and STK. The TTK courses focus more on technical aspects, the STK courses focus more on practical matters. * Vocational Secondary Education (; BSO. About 30% of all pupils): Very practical and very job-specific education. Afterwards, several directions offer seventh, sometimes eighth, specialisation years. * Art Secondary Education (; KSO. About 2% of all pupils): These schools link general and broad secondary education development with active art practice, ranging from performance arts to display arts. Students with disabilities can follow Special Secondary Education (; BuSO), of different types. Higher education There are five universities in the Flemish Community, each forming an \\"association\\" with one or more university colleges (hogescholen). * The Catholic University of Leuven (KU Leuven) is the largest university and the oldest in the Low Countries. As of 2014, it had 46,385 enrolled students, or 20% of all students in Flemish higher education.Hoger onderwijs in cijfers, 2014-2015, Flemish Ministry of Education It forms the KU Leuven Association together with various university colleges located throughout Flanders. * Ghent University (UGent) is a public university which was known as Rijksuniversiteit Gent (State University of Ghent) until being granted autonomy in 1991. The Ghent University Association further includes Hogeschool Gent, which is the largest university college of Flanders, Arteveldehogeschool and Hogeschool West-Vlaanderen. * The University of Antwerp forms the Antwerp University Association together with Artesis Plantijn Hogeschool Antwerpen, Karel de Grote-Hogeschool and the Antwerp Maritime Academy. * The Free University of Brussels (VUB) forms the Brussels University Association with the Erasmushogeschool Brussel. * The University of Hasselt forms the Limburg University Association together with the larger Hogeschool PXL. The former Catholic University of Brussels (K.U. Brussel) merged into the Catholic University of Leuven. Many universities and university colleges are historically tied to their respective \\"pillars\\" in society, KU Leuven being the prominent Catholic university, Ghent University being tied to the socialist pillar and the Free University of Brussels representing the liberal pillar. Certain universities have agreements which give students the option of following certain courses in the French-speaking counterpart: * Katholieke Universiteit Leuven - Universit√© catholique de Louvain * Vrije Universiteit Brussel - Universit√© libre de Bruxelles As part of the Bologna Process, the Flemish government set up in cooperation with the Dutch government an Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders (NVAO). As of 2014, 227,943 students were enrolled in Flemish higher education. Quality Education in Belgium, particularly in Flanders, is often considered to be of high quality. In the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), Flanders is among the top countries. In mathematics for example, Flemish eighth-grade students were the 5th‚Äì6th best performing in 1995‚Äì2003 (Flanders is not included in the study for 2007). Foreign students Relatively many students of neighbouring countries, especially from the Netherlands, attend Flemish schools. In primary and secondary education, this is some 5,950 students as of 2011 (25,200 if families from neighbouring countries but actually living in Flanders are included too), a rising number. On the other hand, a decreasing 1,422 Flemish students attend schools in neighbouring countries.Meer leerlingen uit onze buurlanden kiezen voor Vlaams onderwijs, 7 June 2012, N-VA Language Medium of instruction A poster at a school in Huldenberg saying: \\"In the interest of your child, we speak Dutch here! You do too?\\" The language used as medium of instruction in schools subsidized by the Flemish government is Dutch. Flemish schools in Brussels provide Dutch-medium education, whereas French-medium education there is provided by or recognised by the Government of the French Community. The Flemish Government is however required to provide French-medium schools in the twelve municipalities with language facilities if there is demand for it. Contrary to French-speaking Belgium and other European countries, bilingual education is still rare in Flanders. In higher education, the use of English is allowed but restricted. Foreign languages All Dutch-speaking schools teach French as first foreign language, English being the second foreign language. German and Spanish are often also available depending on the school direction. Compared to other European countries, Flemish pupils aged 13‚Äì15 score remarkably well for their knowledge of English, which is taught as a second foreign language, although less so for French, which is the first foreign language. Vlaamse tieners sterk in Engels, niet in Frans, 22 June 2012, De Standaard Olyfran is a popular contest organised to test students' knowledge of the French language. Brussels In Brussels, the Dutch-speaking school system functions separately from the French-language education system. For the Flemish schools in Brussels, The \\"Scholengroep Brussels\\" Scholengroep Brussel serves as the organising body for most of the \\"state schools\\" (\\"GO!\\" education), while the Flemish Community Commission is the organising body for the Dutch-speaking Brussels schools that until 1995 belonged to the province of Brabant. In February 2012, the Dutch-speaking schools in the Brussels- Capital Region counted 11,776 in pre-school education, 14,850 pupils in primary education and 12,535 in secondary education.Over het Brussels Nederlandstalig onderwijs: Leerlingentelling op 1 februari 2012 These numbers have been growing considerably since several decades. Some of the students speak Dutch at home, others French, but about half of those attending Dutch- speaking schools in Brussels use another language at home.

History WLRX, which originally signed on the air in 1973 as WITO, would later go through format and call letter changes as WMLV (1985‚Äì97) and WFXN (1997‚Äì2002) before Clear Channel Communications transformed them into a local version of the KISS-FM brand under the WBKS call letters. But unlike the traditional mainstream top 40 format that was used at their sister stations, this version focused on rhythmic hits and did not use the trademarked blue ball. The reason for this was due to having a sister station in WKEE, which is the market's top 40 outlet.

Daniel McGilvary and Mrs. Sophia McGilvary in April 1867. It was established as a mission of the Board of Foreign Missions, Presbyterian Church in the United States. Mission The original vision for the mission came from Dr. Dan Beach Bradley, who himself once proposed starting a mission in the North. The Laos Mission included, at one time or another, six stations in Northern Siam: Chiang Mai (founded 1867); Lampang (founded in 1885 and originally known as the Lakawn Station); Lamphun (founded 1891 and made a sub-station of Chiang Mai in 1897); Phrae (1893): Nan (1895); and Chiang Rai (1896). In addition, the mission founded a station in 1903 to work with the Tai peoples of eastern Burma in Kengtung, which was closed in 1907; and it founded another station, the Chiang Rung Station, in Yunnan Province, southern China in 1917. The mission founded its first church, Chiang Mai Church, now known simply as First Church, Chiang Mai, in 1868. After a brief period of evangelistic success, the mission underwent a time of persecution in 1869, during which two converts were martyred. The mission did not fully recover until the late 1870s. In 1880, it founded three congregations including the Mae Dok Daeng Church, known today as the Suwanduangrit Church, Ban Dok Daeng. In 1885, the mission sponsored the founding of the Presbytery of North Laos, officially under the Synod of New York City, to give oversight to the churches. By the 1890s, the mission increasingly emphasized medical and educational institutional work, founding boarding schools, such as Prince Royal's College and Chiang Rai Witthayakhom School, hospitals and dispensaries in each of the stations. The churches, meanwhile, numbered 37 by 1920, the last year of the mission, and communicate membership numbered 6,649 that same year. The presbytery continued in existence until 1934, when it was incorporated into the Church of Christ in Thailand. Beginning in the 1890s, the majority of the mission's members campaigned for mission expansion into the Shan States of Burma, which brought it into a protracted, time-consuming territorial dispute with the American Baptists in Burma. For a brief period from 1911 to 1914, the mission's church grew rapidly in the wake of malaria and smallpox epidemics in various parts of northern Siam. With improvements in communications between northern and central Siam, the Laos Mission was united with the Siam Mission in 1920-21.From Herb Swanson with permission See also *Chiang Rai Witthayakhom School *Prince Royal's College References *Curtis, Lillian Johnson.

In social psychology, attribution is the process by which individuals explain the causes of behavior and events. Models to explain this process are called attribution theory. Psychological research into attribution began with the work of Fritz Heider in the early 20th century, and the theory was further advanced by Harold Kelley and Bernard Weiner. Background Gestalt psychologist Fritz Heider is often described as the early-20th-century \\"father of attribution theory\\". In his 1920s dissertation, Heider addressed the problem of phenomenology: why do perceivers attribute the properties such as color to perceived objects, when those properties are mental constructs? Heider's answer that perceivers attribute that which they \\"directly\\" sense ‚Äì vibrations in the air for instance ‚Äì to an object they construe as causing those to sense data. \\"Perceivers faced with sensory data thus see the perceptual object as 'out there', because they attribute the sensory data to their underlying causes in the world.\\" Heider extended this idea to attributions about people: \\"motives, intentions, sentiments ... the core processes which manifest themselves in overt behavior\\". Types External External attribution, also called situational attribution, refers to interpreting someone's behavior as being caused by the situation that the individual is in. For example, if one's car tire is punctured, it may be attributed to a hole in the road; by making attributions to the poor condition of the highway, one can make sense of the event without any discomfort that it may in reality have been the result of their own bad driving. Ex. A child attributes their feelings to the weather outside their house; it is raining outside, because it is raining outside the child feels sad. Internal Internal attribution, or dispositional attribution, refers to the process of assigning the cause of behavior to some internal characteristic, like ability and motivation, rather than to outside forces. This concept has overlap with the Locus of control, in which individuals feel they are personally responsible for everything that happens to them. Ex. A child attributes the weather to their feelings; the child is feeling sad, because the child is feeling sad it is raining outside. Theories and models Common sense psychology From the book The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations (1958), Fritz Heider tried to explore the nature of interpersonal relationship, and espoused the concept of what he called \\"common sense\\" or \\"na√Øve psychology\\". In his theory, he believed that people observe, analyze, and explain behaviors with explanations. Although people have different kinds of explanations for the events of human behaviors, Heider found it is very useful to group explanation into two categories; Internal (personal) and external (situational) attributions. When an internal attribution is made, the cause of the given behavior is assigned to the individual's characteristics such as ability, personality, mood, efforts, attitudes, or disposition. When an external attribution is made, the cause of the given behavior is assigned to the situation in which the behavior was seen such as the task, other people, or luck (that the individual producing the behavior did so because of the surrounding environment or the social situation). These two types lead to very different perceptions of the individual engaging in a behavior. Correspondent inference Correspondent inferences state that people make inferences about a person when their actions are freely chosen, are unexpected, and result in a small number of desirable effects. According to Edward E. Jones and Keith Davis' correspondent inference theory, people make correspondent inferences by reviewing the context of behavior. It describes how people try to find out individual's personal characteristics from the behavioral evidence. People make inferences on the basis of three factors; degree of choice, expectedness of behavior, and effects of someone's behaviors. For example, we believe we can make stronger assumptions about a man who gives half of his money to charity, than we can about one who gives $5 to charity. An average person would not want to donate as much as the first man because they would lose a lot of money. By donating half of his money, it is easier for someone to figure out what the first man's personality is like. The second factor, that affects correspondence of action and inferred characteristic, is the number of differences between the choices made and the previous alternatives. If there aren't many differences, the assumption made will match the action because it is easy to guess the important aspect between each choice. Covariation model The covariation model states that people attribute behavior to the factors that are present when a behavior occurs and absent when it does not. Thus, the theory assumes that people make causal attributions in a rational, logical fashion, and that they assign the cause of an action to the factor that co-varies most closely with that action. Harold Kelley's covariation model of attribution looks to three main types of information from which to make an attribution decision about an individual's behavior. The first is consensus information, or information on how other people in the same situation and with the same stimulus behave. The second is distinctive information, or how the individual responds to different stimuli. The third is consistency information, or how frequent the individual's behavior can be observed with similar stimulus but varied situations. From these three sources of affirmation observers make attribution decisions on the individual's behavior as either internal or external. There have been claims that people under-utilise consensus information, although there has been some dispute over this. There are several levels in the covariation model: high and low. Each of these levels influences the three covariation model criteria. High consensus is when many people can agree on an event or area of interest. Low consensus is when very few people can agree. High distinctiveness is when the event or area of interest is very unusual, whereas low distinctness is when the event or area of interest is fairly common. High consistency is when the event or area of interest continues for a length of time and low consistency is when the event or area of interest goes away quickly. Three-dimensional model Bernard Weiner proposed that individuals have initial affective responses to the potential consequences of the intrinsic or extrinsic motives of the actor, which in turn influence future behavior. That is, a person's own perceptions or attributions as to why they succeeded or failed at an activity determine the amount of effort the person will engage in activities in the future. Weiner suggests that individuals exert their attribution search and cognitively evaluate casual properties on the behaviors they experience. When attributions lead to positive affect and high expectancy of future success, such attributions should result in greater willingness to approach to similar achievement tasks in the future than those attributions that produce negative affect and low expectancy of future success. Eventually, such affective and cognitive assessment influences future behavior when individuals encounter similar situations. Weiner's achievement attribution has three categories: # stable theory (stable and unstable) # locus of control (internal and external) # controllability (controllable or uncontrollable) Stability influences individuals' expectancy about their future; control is related with individuals' persistence on mission; causality influences emotional responses to the outcome of task. Bias and errors While people strive to find reasons for behaviors, they fall into many traps of biases and errors. As Fritz Heider says, \\"our perceptions of causality are often distorted by our needs and certain cognitive biases\\". The following are examples of attributional biases. Fundamental attribution error The fundamental attribution error describes the habit to misunderstand dispositional or personality-based explanations for behavior, rather than considering external factors. The fundamental attribution error is most visible when people explain and assume the behavior of others. For example, if a person is overweight, a person's first assumption might be that they have a problem with overeating or are lazy and not that they might have a medical reason for being heavier set. When evaluating others' behaviors, the situational context is often ignored in favor of assuming the disposition of the actor to be the cause of an observed behavior. This is because when a behavior occurs attention is most often focused on the person performing the behavior. Thus, the individual is more salient than the environment and dispositional attributions are made more often than situational attributions to explain the behavior of others. However, when evaluating one's own behavior, the situational factors are often exaggerated when there is a negative outcome while dispositional factors are exaggerated when there is a positive outcome. The core process assumptions of attitude construction models are mainstays of social cognition research and are not controversial‚Äîas long as we talk about \\"judgment\\". Once the particular judgment made can be thought of as a person's \\"attitude\\", however, construal assumptions elicit discomfort, presumably because they dispense with the intuitively appealing attitude concept. Culture bias Culture bias is when someone makes an assumption about the behavior of a person based on their cultural practices and beliefs. An example of culture bias is the dichotomy of \\"individualistic\\" and \\"collectivistic cultures\\". People in individualist cultures, generally Anglo-America and Anglo-Saxon European, are characterized as societies which value individualism, personal goals, and independence. People in collectivist cultures are thought to regard individuals as members of groups such as families, tribes, work units, and nations, and tend to value conformity and interdependence. In other words, working together and being involved as a group is more common in certain cultures that views each person as a part of the community. This cultural trait is common in Asia, traditional Native American societies, and Africa. Research shows that culture, either individualist or collectivist, affects how people make attributions. People from individualist cultures are more inclined to make fundamental-attribution error than people from collectivist cultures. Individualist cultures tend to attribute a person's behavior due to their internal factors whereas collectivist cultures tend to attribute a person's behavior to his external factors. Research suggests that individualist cultures engage in self-serving bias more than do collectivist cultures, i.e. individualist cultures tend to attribute success to internal factors and to attribute failure to external factors. In contrast, collectivist cultures engage in the opposite of self- serving bias i.e. self-effacing bias, which is: attributing success to external factors and blaming failure on internal factors (the individual). Actor/observer difference People tend to attribute other people's behaviors to their dispositional factors while attributing their own actions to situational factors. In the same situation, people's attribution can differ depending on their role as actor or observer. For example, when a person scores a low grade on a test, they find situational factors to justify the negative event such as saying that the teacher asked a question that he/she never went over in class. However, if another person scores poorly on a test, the person will attribute the results to internal factors such as laziness and inattentiveness in classes. The theory of the actor-observer bias was first developed by E. Jones and R. Nisbett in 1971, whose explanation for the effect was that when we observe other people, we tend to focus on the person, whereas when we are actors, our attention is focused towards situational factors. The actor/observer bias is used less frequently with people one knows well such as friends and family since one knows how his/her close friends and family will behave in certain situation, leading him/her to think more about the external factors rather than internal factors. Dispositional attributions Dispositional attribution is a tendency to attribute people's behaviors to their dispositions; that is, to their personality, character, and ability. For example, when a normally pleasant waiter is being rude to his/her customer, the customer may assume he/she has a bad character. The customer, just by looking at the attitude that the waiter is giving him/her, instantly decides that the waiter is a bad person. The customer oversimplifies the situation by not taking into account all the unfortunate events that might have happened to the waiter which made him/her become rude at that moment. Therefore, the customer made dispositional attribution by attributing the waiter's behavior directly to his/her personality rather than considering situational factors that might have caused the whole \\"rudeness\\". Self-serving bias Self- serving bias is attributing dispositional and internal factors for success, while external and uncontrollable factors are used to explain the reason for failure. For example, if a person gets promoted, it is because of his/her ability and competence whereas if he/she does not get promoted, it is because his/her manager does not like him/her (external, uncontrollable factor). Originally, researchers assumed that self-serving bias is strongly related to the fact that people want to protect their self-esteem. However, an alternative information processing explanation is that when the outcomes match people's expectations, they make attributions to internal factors. For example, if you pass a test you believe it was because of your intelligence; when the outcome does not match their expectations, they make external attributions or excuses. Whereas if you fail a test, you would give an excuse saying that you did not have enough time to study. People also use defensive attribution to avoid feelings of vulnerability and to differentiate themselves from a victim of a tragic accident. An alternative version of the theory of self-serving bias states that the bias does not arise because people wish to protect their private self-esteem, but to protect their self-image (a self- presentational bias). This version of the theory would predict that people attribute their successes to situational factors, for fear that others will disapprove of them looking overly vain if they should attribute successes to themselves. For example, it is suggested that coming to believe that \\"good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people\\" will reduce feelings of vulnerability . This belief would have side-effects of blaming the victim even in tragic situations. When a mudslide destroys several houses in a rural neighborhood, a person living in a more urban setting might blame the victims for choosing to live in a certain area or not building a safer, stronger house. Another example of attributional bias is optimism bias in which most people believe positive events happen to them more often than to others and that negative events happen to them less often than to others. For example, smokers on average believe they are less likely to get lung cancer than other smokers. Defensive attribution hypothesis The defensive attribution hypothesis is a social psychological term referring to a set of beliefs held by an individual with the function of defending themselves from concern that they will be the cause or victim of a mishap. Commonly, defensive attributions are made when individuals witness or learn of a mishap happening to another person. In these situations, attributions of responsibility to the victim or harm-doer for the mishap will depend upon the severity of the outcomes of the mishap and the level of personal and situational similarity between the individual and victim. More responsibility will be attributed to the harm-doer as the outcome becomes more severe, and as personal or situational similarity decreases. An example of defensive attribution is the just-world hypothesis, which is where \\"good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people\\". People believe in this in order to avoid feeling vulnerable to situations that they have no control over. However, this also leads to blaming the victim even in a tragic situation. When people hear someone died from a car accident, they decide that the driver was drunk at the time of the accident, and so they reassure themselves that an accident will never happen to them. Despite the fact there was no other information provided, people will automatically attribute that the accident was the driver's fault due to an internal factor (in this case, deciding to drive while drunk), and thus they would not allow it to happen to themselves. Another example of defensive attribution is optimism bias, in which people believe positive events happen to them more often than to others and that negative events happen to them less often than to others. Too much optimism leads people to ignore some warnings and precautions given to them. For example, smokers believe that they are less likely to get lung cancer than other smokers. Application Attribution theory can be applied to juror decision making. Jurors use attributions to explain the cause of the defendant's intent and actions related to the criminal behavior. The attribution made (situational or dispositional) might affect a juror's punitiveness towards the defendant. When jurors attribute a defendant's behavior to dispositional attributions they tend to be more punitive and are more likely find a defendant guilty and to recommend a death sentence compared to a life sentence. In Marketing Communication The Attribution theories have been used as a tool to analyze causal attributions made by consumers and its effectiveness in marketing communication. Swinyard, W. R., & Ray, M. L. (1977). Advertising-selling interactions: an attribution theory experiment. Journal of Marketing Research, 14(4), 509-516.; Laczniak, R. N., DeCarlo, T. E., & Ramaswami, S. N.

(2001). Consumers‚Äô responses to negative word‚Äêof‚Äêmouth communication: An attribution theory perspective. Journal of consumer Psychology, 11(1), 57-73. In clinical psychology Attribution theory has had a big application in clinical psychology. Abramson, Seligman, and Teasdale developed a theory of the depressive attributional style, claiming that individuals who tend to attribute their failures to internal, stable and global factors are more vulnerable to clinical depression. The Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ) was developed back in 1996 to assess whether individuals have the depressogenic attributional style. However, the ASQ has been criticized, with some researchers preferring to use a technique called Content Analysis of Verbatim Explanation (CAVE) in which an individual's ordinary writings are analyzed to assess whether s/he is vulnerable to the depressive attributional style. The key advantage of using content analysis is its non-invasive nature, in contrast to collecting survey answers or simulating social experiences. Learned helplessness The concept of learned helplessness emerged from animal research in which psychologists Martin Seligman and Steven F. Maier discovered that dogs classically conditioned to an electrical shock which they could not escape, subsequently failed to attempt to escape an avoidable shock in a similar situation. They argued that learned helplessness applied to human psychopathology. In particular, individuals who attribute negative outcomes to internal, stable and global factors reflect a view in which they have no control over their situation. It is suggested that this aspect of not attempting to better a situation exacerbates negative mood, and may lead to clinical depression and related mental illnesses. Perceptual salience When people try to make attributions about another's behavior, their information focuses on the individual. Their perception of that individual is lacking most of the external factors which might affect the individual. The gaps tend to be skipped over and the attribution is made based on the perception information most salient. The most salient perceptual information dominates a person's perception of the situation. For individuals making behavioral attributions about themselves, the situation and external environment are entirely salient, but their own body and behavior are less so. This leads to the tendency to make an external attribution in regard to their own behavior. Criticism Attribution theory has been criticised as being mechanistic and reductionist for assuming that people are rational, logical, and systematic thinkers. The fundamental attribution error, however, demonstrates that they are cognitive misers and motivated tactician. It also fails to address the social, cultural, and historical factors that shape attributions of cause. This has been addressed extensively by discourse analysis, a branch of psychology that prefers to use qualitative methods including the use of language to understand psychological phenomena. The linguistic categorization theory for example demonstrates how language influences our attribution style.

An author may formally require attribution required via a license, legally preventing others from claiming to have written the work and allowing a copyright holder to retain reputational benefits from having written it. In cases when the copyright holder is the author themselves, this behavior is often moralized as a sign of decency and respect to acknowledge the creator by giving them credit for the work.

The hind-gut is at first prolonged backward into the body-stalk as the tube of the allantois; but, with the growth and flexure of the tail-end of the embryo, the body-stalk, with its contained allantoic tube, is carried forward to the ventral aspect of the body, and consequently a bend is formed at the junction of the hind-gut and allantois. This bend becomes dilated into a pouch, which constitutes the endodermal cloaca; into its dorsal part the hind- gut opens, and from its ventral part the allantois passes forward. At a later stage the Wolffian duct and M√ºllerian duct open into its ventral portion. The cloaca is, for a time, shut off from the anterior by the cloacal membrane, formed by the apposition of the ectoderm and endoderm, and reaching, at first, as far forward as the future umbilicus. Behind the umbilicus, however, the mesoderm subsequently extends to form the lower part of the abdominal wall and pubic symphysis. By the growth of the surrounding tissues the cloacal membrane comes to lie at the bottom of a depression, which is lined by ectoderm and named the ectodermal cloaca. Clinical significance A birth defect can arise known as a persistent cloaca where the rectum, vagina, and urinary tract fuse to create a common channel or cloaca. A rare birth defect which leaves much of the abdominal organs exposed is known as cloacal exstrophy. Additional images File:Gray977.png|Human embryo about fifteen days old.

Streetcar along North Ave. crossing western branch of Clear Creek, near today's intersection of North and Penn at the boundary of what are now Midtown and the Old Fourth Ward. (Atlanta History Center) Clear Creek is a stream in northeast Atlanta that is a tributary to Peachtree Creek and part of the Chattahoochee River watershed. It has two main branches, one originating east of the high ground along which Boulevard runs and another to the west originating on the northeast side of downtown Atlanta. The easterly branch of Clear Creek begins in several springs and branches in what are now Inman Park and the Old Fourth Ward. Flowing north, the creek was joined by other branches and springs, including Angier Springs near the end of Belgrade Avenue and the so-called Ponce de Leon Springs, which were ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù during railroad construction in the 1860s and gave rise to the eponymous park and avenue. The western branch of Clear Creek began in the northeast quadrant of downtown between Decatur and Peachtree Streets and flowed through the lowlands east of Piedmont Avenue where the Atlanta Civic Center was built in the mid-1960s. In the fall of 1864 the Union Army camped along the creek, and for several decades that prong of Clear Creek was known as Shermantown Branch. Flowing in a northeasterly meander through the eastern side of the Midtown neighborhood, it joined the eastern prong of the creek in the vicinity of the present Grady High School stadium. From there the creek flowed in a northerly direction and is joined by several smaller tributaries, including one which originated in at least two springs, one in the vicinity of the Federal Reserve and another northeast of the intersection of Eighth and Juniper Streets. Their water combined to form a branch that was large enough to be dammed in 1894 to create Piedmont Park‚Äôs Clara Meer. Today there are six springs in the restored wetlands below the dam. A somewhat larger branch drains Orme Park and a large part of the northwest side of Virginia-Highland as well as the southwest side of Morningside. Sometimes known as Stillhouse Branch in the nineteenth century, it joins Clear Creek a few hundred feet west of the dead end of Dutch Valley Road. A smaller branch drains most of Ansley Park, emptying into Clear Creek in the Ansley Golf Club‚Äôs course east of Montgomery Ferry Road, and yet another branch out of Sherwood Forest flows into Clear Creek just east of the Interstate 85 bridge. In the mid-nineteenth century, a grist mill was located just downstream from where the Beltline crosses the creek at the northern end of Piedmont Park. As Jones Mill, it was a landmark in maps from the Civil War, but it is often known as Walkers Mill, for a later owner. For decades in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the creek was used as a sewer and polluted by industrial waste. The western branch was completely buried by the 1930s and much of the eastern branch by 1950. North of Tenth Street, the creek was turned into a large concrete channel through Piedmont Park and through the Ansley gold course.  Recent efforts to improve water quality, habitat, access and opportunities for nature appreciation   Clear Creek Basin at Historic Fourth Ward Park (2011)  Historic Fourth Ward Park comprises 17 acres of headwaters greenspace and is built on the site of the old Ponce de Leon amusement park, just south of Ponce City Market and just west of the BeltLine trail. Intended to provide stormwater management for an area undergoing intensive redevelopment, it was one of the first completed urban park elements of the Atlanta BeltLine project. Construction includes a two-acre detention pond providing relief to the City of Atlanta‚Äôs combined sewer system, a 24‚Äù tap into the existing 9‚Äô x 9‚Äô Clear Creek trunk sewer, the installation of nearly 1,000 LF 6‚Äô x 3‚Äô box culvert, re-routing and reconstructing city streets, elevated walkways, extensive walls, ramps, various hardscapes, decorative railings, site lighting, wetlands plantings and landscaping. The pond generates a minimum of 425 gallons a minute from the submerged Clear Creek water table available for maintaining the park's lawns and playing fields. Additional water features include a ten-foot waterfall to aerate and recycle the pond water and a stone water cascade that runs alongside one of the park‚Äôs walkways.  Stream and wetland rehabilitation at Piedmont Park (2011)  Recent parkland expansion and multimillion-dollar green infrastructure developments (2011, 2013) managed through the Piedmont Park Conservancy are designed to improve Clear Creek's water quality and enhance biodiversity. Educational signage along the waterway offers information about the importance of healthy watershed systems.  Clear Creek CSO Treatment Facility at 1320 Monroe Drive (1996)  Comprising approximately 3,086 acres and having a maximum overflow capacity of approximately 5,060 million gallons per day (mgd), the Clear Creek CSO Facility serves the largest combined sewershed of the City‚Äôs seven CSO facilities, and includes the Downtown Business District and Midtown Atlanta. Dry weather flow (less than 40 mgd is routed to the Peachtree interceptor, which then takes the flow to the R.M. Clayton WRC for treatment. Wet weather flow is routed to the Clear Creek CSO facility for treatment before being discharged to an open channel that leads to Clear Creek. Existing treatment consists of coarse screening, fine screening, and disinfection by sodium hypochlorite.  Clear Creek Nature Preserve & City of Atlanta Greenway Acquisition Project (1998 - 2007)  The City of Atlanta Greenway Acquisition Project was a $25 million program to acquire and protect properties adjacent to selected rivers and creeks within the Metro Atlanta area. Once acquired, these greenway properties are to be forever maintained in a natural, undisturbed state. Clear Creek Nature Preserve of Brookwood Hills Community Club comprises 70 acres of privately held riparian bottomland protected by conservation easement through the Greenway Acquisition Project. Conservation of greenway properties protects water quality in rivers and streams and also protects animal habitats, plant habitats, and wetlands. Land adjacent to the waterways is to be protected from erosion, flood damage, and clear-cutting.  New urbanism style planning and redevelopment within the Clear Creek watershed and BeltLine corridor   Greater Piedmont Heights Master Framework Plan (2012)  Objectives: 1\\\\.

The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells motor vehicles.  United Kingdom  General Motors introduced a new range of medium-sized family cars, the \\"J Car\\". The British-built version of the car was called the Vauxhall Cavalier which launched in September, while its German twin was sold as the Opel Ascona. This incarnation of the car had front-wheel drive and a hatchback bodystyle to run alongside the saloon. The engine line-up included 1.3 L and 1.6 L petrol units as well as a 1.6 L diesel, with larger engined models to go on sale in the near future. The new car was also sold by other brands of General Motors, including Chevrolet in the USA and Holden in Australia. After 11 years on sale, during which time it was sold as a Hillman, Chrysler and finally a Talbot, production of the Avenger ceased under Peugeot ownership. It had gradually declined in popularity following the launch of the more modern Horizon and Alpine models during the late 1970s. Talbot's entry-level model, the Sunbeam, ceased production in late 1981 and was succeeded by the Talbot Samba a compact three-door hatchback which used the same underpinnings and bodyshell as the Peugeot 104. A cabriolet model would follow later. British Leyland announced the end of Austin Maxi production in July 1981, 12 years after the car first went on sale. There was no direct successor, although a new family hatchback ‚Äì first planned towards the end of the 1970s ‚Äì would be launched by early 1983. Meanwhile, British Leyland enjoyed success with its new Metro compact hatchback as Lady Diana Spencer bought 1 prior to her marriage to Prince Charles. British Leyland ceased production of the Princess after six years. Its successor, the Austin Ambassador, was a facelifted version of the original 1975 car, but the most significant change was the transition from saloon to hatchback bodystyle. The new car would only be sold in Britain. British Leyland's Triumph division was undergoing a major transformation for 1981. The Dolomite and TR7 ranges ceased production after a collective lifespan of 17 years. The marque would include one single model: the Acclaim, which was the result of a venture with Honda. The Acclaim was powered by a 1.3 L overhead camshaft petrol engine capable of 97 mph. Production of the new car, which debuted in 1980 in Japan as the Honda Ballade, took place at the Cowley plant in Oxford. The venture with Honda also saw development work begin on a new car which was expected to replace the Rover SD1 halfway through the decade. The Triumph name disappeared on sports cars with the demise of the Triumph TR7 in October, on the closure of the Speke factory near Liverpool which had been producing Triumph cars since 1959.  France  Renault introduced a new front-wheel-drive range of saloons ‚Äì the R9 ‚Äì at the end of 1981, giving it a competitor for the new-for-1980 Ford Escort. The initial engine range included 1.1 and 1.4 petrol engines; larger engined models followed. The 1.4 version was available with a five-speed manual gearbox, a rarity in comparable cars of the time. The American market received a version of the 9, known as the Renault Alliance, as Renault attempted to gain more popularity at the far side of the Atlantic through its partnership with the American Motors Corporation. The Renault 9 made an impact in Europe, as the continent's motoring journalists voted it Car of the Year for 1982 ahead of the two favourites; the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Ascona and Volkswagen Polo.  Germany  Volkswagen brought its range up to date for the 1980s by launching new generations of its Polo supermini and Passat large family car. Both cars were a huge success during their original 1970s incarnations. The Passat continued as a hatchback and estate, while the Polo hatchback was joined by a saloon model which (in Europe) no longer wore the Derby nameplate which was seen on the booted version of the original Polo. The Polo featured a new vertical tailgate which had the appearance of an estate rather than the hatchback it was officially marketed as. The Audi Quattro was imported to British shores a year after going on sale in its homeland. With a 2.1 L turbo engine and four-wheel drive, the coup√© was capable of around 140 mph and enjoyed a successful motorsport career. Mercedes-Benz strengthened its position as one of the world's most desirable brands of car by introducing an all-new version of the acclaimed S-Class luxury saloon. The range-topper of the new S-Class range was the 560SEL, which was powered by a 5.5 L V8 petrol engine and had a top speed of approximately 150 mph, making it one of the fastest four-door cars made up to that time.  Italy  After almost a decade on sale in Europe, Fiat exported the X1/9 sports car to America.  Spain  Following the split from Fiat, SEAT rebranded its Fiat-based model range, with the Panda becoming the Marbella, the Ritmo becoming the Ronda and the 127 becoming the Fura.  Japan  The first generation Accord was a worldwide sales success for Honda, showing that it could build a rival for the Ford Cortina. The Americans were particularly impressed by the Accord, though its sales success was not quite matched in Europe. The new model had improved fuel economy, despite using the same 1.8 L petrol engine that powered the original Accord. The Toyota Celica entered its third incarnation with a much more modern body style, primarily aimed at the American market. Power came from 1.6 L, 1.8 L, 2.0 L and 2.4 L petrol engines. There was also a three-door liftback version. For those who wanted high performance, European buyers finally got the Celica Supra, which came with a 2.8 L engine and was fast enough to be considered a serious competitor for the likes of the Porsche 924.

In the show, three contestants compete for a chance to win up to $10,000 by trying to guess television shows, characters, or actors by asking the other contestants either yes or no questions related to the subject. The show ran for two seasons, ending on December 7, 2007. The series was created by Michael Geddes and Christopher Geddes of Lone Eagle Entertainment in Toronto, Ontario, and is hosted by actor/comedian Sam Kalilieh. The two were also producers of two other game shows, Game On and You Bet Your Ass. Gameplay The game has a similar format to 20 Questions, with a few minor twists. Three rounds in total are played. Three contestants compete for a chance at $10,000. In the first two rounds, each contestant gets a turn inside a television-shaped booth called \\"The Box\\" which contains 2 monitors, while the other two players are seated at separate desks with single monitors facing and to the left and right of \\"The Box\\". The contestant \\"Inside the Box\\" is given a basic category to indicate what kind of an answer is being sought (for example, \\"Series\\", \\"Reality Series\\", \\"Male Actor\\", \\"Female Character\\", etc.), a list of questions on a touch-sensitive screen and reads questions selected from the list to one of his/her two opponents. The opponents outside The Box are shown only a photograph and the name of the character/actor/show which is the correct answer on their monitor screens. The contestant in the booth has two minutes to determine the correct answer by alternately asking his/her opponents the \\"Yes or No\\" questions he is shown. If an opponent answers the question incorrectly, he is given a time penalty of 5 seconds. Each Yes-response question is displayed on screen for the viewers to see and on the second screen in The Box, regardless of whether the player outside the Box answered correctly or not. After each group of 5 \\"Yes\\" responses, the clock is stopped and a more detailed clue is given. The player in the Box is given a free guess, but if they can't correctly answer, the clock resumes and they must continue asking questions. Each time a new clue is given, new questions are made available to the player in The Box. The contestant continues to ask questions until either time runs out, or he/she is able to give a correct answer. The player in The Box may ask at any time for the clock to be stopped so they can attempt a guess, but an incorrect guess under these conditions results in a 5-second penalty. After each player's turn in The Box, the scores are totaled and time penalties assessed; then the remaining contestants are given their turn in The Box. The scoring is based on time. If a player correctly identifies the player with 35 seconds to spare, those 35 seconds are added to his/her score. Any time penalties are deducted and negative scores are possible. Each player gets two turns in The Box and the player with the best cumulative time after the first two rounds gets a chance to play the final round. Final round In the final round, the champion is given two minutes. Instead of asking his/her opponents the \\"Yes or No\\" questions, he/she asks them to host Sam Kalilieh. The champion is given a starting clue and every 5 \\"Yes\\" responses earn another clue; however, the clock does not stop in the final round. He is given three chances to give the answer. The amount of money in the pot is reduced by $500 approximately every six seconds until time runs out. If the player gives the correct answer before time expires he/she wins whatever money is remaining. If he/she gives 3 incorrect answers or time runs out, he/she takes home the minimum consolation prize of $500. Answers are usually derived from American pop culture. Syndication In the United States, Program Partners, a division of Sony Pictures Television, syndicated Inside the Box to local stations for the first half of the 2008‚Äì09 season, as an optional replacement or companion program for Merv Griffin's Crosswords, which was then on hiatus (although very few American stations actually took the series). However, it was eventually decided not to go forth with additional first-run episodes of Crosswords, and both shows were officially cancelled in February 2009. () Reruns started airing on Comedy Gold and Canada's E! September 3, 2013, while GameTV picked it up on April 3, 2017. The show was dropped from E!'s schedule on September 1, 2017, and Comedy Gold dropped it, along with many other of its shows, on December 29, 2017. GameTV aired only 40 season 2 shows until being removed on April 1, 2019.

Moreover, three waterways between the Pacific ocean and the Atlantic ocean, namely the Strait of Magellan, the Beagle Channel and the Drake Passage, pass the Chilean coasts. In order to mark dangerous coastlines, hazardous shoals, reefs, and safe entries to harbors, the Chilean authorities maintain 650 lighthouses from the border with Peru to the Atlantic ocean. History On 18 September 1857, the first lighthouse in Chile, the \\"Faro Angeles\\", was inaugurated in Valpara√≠so. In 1867, the Dane Enrique Siemsen was appointed chief of the \\"Servicio de Faros\\". He built the Faro Corona in Ancud, Punta Caldera in Atacama, Punta Tortugas in Coquimbo, Isla Quiriquina in Quiriquina, Punta Galera and Punta Niebla in Corral. The first lighthouses in Chile used colza oil as fuel, but in 1878 it was replaced by Bunsen burners. George Slight designed and built in the 1890s more than 70 of today's historic lighthouses of Chile. He was a Scottish engineer who moved to Chile and eventually became the head of the Chilean Maritime Signaling Service. Present As of 2013, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) lists 650 lighthouses in Chile and according to Faros de ChileFaros de Chile, Editorial Kactus. , P.45 18 of them were inhabited in 2009.

United Kingdom  British Leyland announced the new Austin Ambassador. The Ambassador was a heavily reworked version of the Princess, with a hatchback bodystyle. British Leyland also revived the MG marque, a year after the last MGB was sold. The MG Metro 1300 was a sporty version of the standard Austin hatchback with a 1.3L petrol engine which was capable of 100 mph. British Leyland also expanded the Metro range with the introduction of a Vanden Plas version. In the same year British Leyland sold the Coventry Climax forklift truck and specialist engines business into private ownership. The end of 1982 also saw the end of Austin Allegro production after a decade. It was replaced by the Maestro, which did not go on sale until March 1983. After 20 years on sale, for most of which it was the best selling car in Britain, the Ford Cortina ceased production. Its successor was the aerodynamic Sierra, a range of hatchbacks and estates. A saloon called the Sapphire would launch in early 1987. Underneath, the Sierra differed little from its predecessor. 1.3, 1.6, 2.0 and 2.3 petrol engines were carried over from the Cortina although the car rode on a new rear wheel drive platform with independent rear suspension. There was the added option of a 2.3L diesel unit sourced from Peugeot and a 5 speed gearbox became available. The Sierra divided opinion at launch over its space-age styling which also became known as the \\"jellymould\\". However, Ford dealers still had high stock of the Cortina to shift and sales of it still continued into 1983 but the Sierra still managed second place in the UK's top- selling new cars for that year.  France  Renault withdrew the R14 hatchback from production after six years, with a Renault 9-based model due to replace it during 1983. Citro√´n introduced a new medium-sized hatchback and estate range which replaced the long-running GS - the BX. It was aimed directly at the new Ford Sierra, and was designed to include plastic body panels which were designed to reduce corrosion and improve fuel economy. The engine range started with a 1.1-litre petrol, which was unusual in this size of car and was only to be sold in certain European markets. The BX range's top engines were 1.9 petrol and 1.9 diesel units (turbo and non-turbo). It was launched on the continent in September 1982, but British sales did not begin until the following summer.  Germany  Audi launched the 100, a saloon with an aerodynamic bodyshell. The four-door saloon (no longer with a two-door variant) was joined by the five-door Avant estate car. Equipment levels on the 200 had specification levels comparable to the BMW 7 Series. BMW launched the 3 Series, a new range of two- and four-door saloons aimed to compete with the Audi 80. The 316 was a 1.8 engined model, and the 323i, was capable of around 130 mph. The new 5 Series, is a large saloon aimed at competing with the Audi 100. Volkswagen launched a heavily restyled Scirocco, though it maintains the original front-wheel drive chassis of the original 1974 MK1 Golf based model. The mechanical design and engines are very much the same as before, but the new bodyshell is substantially different. Mercedes-Benz has finally made its cars affordable for the mass production market by introducing the new 190E in December ‚Äì which is a direct competitor for the BMW 3 Series. It is an all-new four-door saloon with rear-wheel drive, with the entry-level model being the 2.0 carburetor engine which produces 105 bhp. Like the larger, more expensive models in the Mercedes range, the 190E is a well-equipped, comfortable, solid, reliable, refined and prestigious competitor which is difficult to beat in almost every area. UK sales commenced in September 1983.  Italy  Fiat made changes to the 132 range which was renamed Argenta. Lancia launched the Prisma, a four-door family saloon. Based on the chassis of the Delta and Fiat Ritmo hatchbacks, it is nearer in size to cars in the Ford Sierra and Opel Ascona (Vauxhall Cavalier) sector. It uses the same mechanical design and engines as the Delta.  Spain  In September the Opel Corsa was launched, a small front-wheel drive hatchback. General Motors announced its intention to import the car from Spain to Britain from April 1983 as a Vauxhall, where it would eventually replace the Chevette.  Japan  Nissan announced a front- wheel drive model in its Sunny range. The model was badged as a Datsun in Europe, and as the Nissan Sentra in America. A new small model in the Nissan range was planned to go on sale the following year. The Cherry was repositioned as a hatchback in the mould of the Volkswagen Golf, with 1982 seeing the Cherry's position in the supermini market filled by the Micra (sold as the March in certain markets), although the Micra will not be available to European buyers until the summer of 1983. Nissan also responded to the growing demand for front-wheel drive hatchbacks with its new Stanza, which was launched in Europe from January 1982 after going on sale in Japan towards the end of 1981. Daihatsu announced the Charmant, a four-door saloon based on the then current Toyota Corolla. It was sold alongside the compact Charade, which competed with the likes of the Austin Metro and Ford Fiesta.  Poland  1982 saw the Polski Fiat badge removed from the long-running Fiat 125 based saloons, which were now badged on all markets as FSO.

His 17-volume Hebrew Bible included Rashi, Mendelssohn, as well as his own Mikraei Kodesh which \\"emended\\" the biblical text and helped spread the Haskalah movement.  Biography and works Before he learned Russian his parents moved to Vilnius, \\"and there he received instruction in Hebrew grammar and rabbinical lore.\\"Pending further edits, \\"Biography and works\\" is a rewrite of AND THE SINGLE SOURCE for the rest of this Wiki article. Benjacob began to write early, and composed short poems and epigrams in pure Biblical Hebrew which are among the best of their kind in Neo-Hebraic literature. For several years he lived in Riga, where he was engaged in business, always studying and writing in his leisure hours. Later he became a publisher and book-seller and went to Leipzig, where he published his first work, Miktamim ve-Shirim (Epigrams and Songs), which also contains an important essay on epigrammatic composition (Leipzig, 1842). Of the other works which he published there, his corrected edition of R. Bahya ibn Pakuda's Chovot ha-Levavot, with an introduction, a short commentary, and a biography of the author, together with notes and fragments of Joseph Kimhi's translation by H. Jellinek, is the most valuable (Leipzig, 1846; K√∂nigsberg, 1859, without the introduction). In 1848 Benjacob returned to Vilnius, and for the next five years he and the poet Abraham Dob B√§r Lebensohn were engaged in the publication of the Bible with a German language translation (in Hebrew type) and the new Biurim (Vilnius, 1848‚Äì1853, 17 vols.), which did much good as a means of spreading the knowledge of German and a proper understanding of the Hebrew text among the Jews in Russia. When this work was done he brought out his corrected and amended edition of Chaim Joseph David Azulai's Shem ha-Gedolim (Vilnius, 1853; Vienna, 1862), which is still the standard edition of that important work. In 1862 Benjacob announced his intention to begin the publication of popular editions of classical Hebrew works which had become rare or high-priced. He died soon after the appearance of the first volume of Azariah dei Rossi's Meor 'Enayim, with which he started the series (Vilnius, 1863).  Communal activities  In his later years Benjacob was one of the leaders and representatives of the Jewish community of Vilnius, and took an active part in all communal affairs. In his correspondence with Isaac B√§r Lewinsohn, which is partly published in Ha-Kerem (pp. 41‚Äì62, Warsaw, 1888), Benjacob throws much light on the condition of the community in the beginning of the second half of the 19th century, and especially on the lamentable condition of the Rabbiner Schule (Rabbinical Seminary) which the government established there and in Jitomir in 1848, and closed in 1873. Benjacob himself was originally destined to be one of the teachers of the Vilnius Seminary, but never filled the position, and later he became one of the severest critics of that institution. These letters are also interesting on account of the idea they give of the perplexities of the old Maskilim of the Mendelssohnian school in Russia, like Benjacob, who were being swept aside by the younger generation which had the advantage of a Russian training. He could not speak Russian, and most of the representatives of the community suffered from the same disability, excepting a few merchants who cared little for the fate of the seminary; the older members were at a great disadvantage when pitted against the young students, who could gain whatever they desired from the authorities on account of their correct Russian accent. Benjacob corresponded with Jewish scholars in Western countries, and was known during his lifetime for his great achievements as a bibliographer, although his monumental work, the Otzar ha-Sefarim, Thesaurus Librorum Hebr√¶orum tam Impressorum quam Manuscriptorum, did not appear till seventeen years after his death (Vilnius, 1880). It was published by his son Jacob, and contains 17,000 entries of Hebrew printed and manuscript works, with valuable notes by M. Steinschneider. An author-index to the work together with additions has been promised (as of 1906) by Steinschneider (Hebr. Bibl. xx. 73; Festschrift, p. vii.). It is the greatest Jewish bibliographical work in the Hebrew language, and is still the standard bibliography of printed books down to 1863. Besides other minor works and articles published in various Hebrew periodicals and collections, Benjacob also commenced a German- Hebrew dictionary and a Mishnaic-Talmudic dictionary with a German translation, both of which were left unfinished.

Since 1882, the British had taken control of Egypt and found themselves involved in the Sudan war. For this reason, they decided to reform and rearm the Egyptian Army. In 1885 a British general, Sir Francis Grenfell was appointed Sirdar (commander-in-chief) and British officers trained and led the newly formed units. The Sudanese, on the other hand had not renounced their ambition of spreading the Mahdist faith to Egypt. In 1889, the Khalifa Abdallahi ibn Muhammad sent the Emir Wad-el-Nujumi and an army 6,000 strong into Egypt for this purpose. The Mahdists avoided Wadi Halfa where most of the Egyptian troops were garrisoned, and camped at Toski by the Nile, 76 km north of the Egyptian border. Here they were attacked by the Egyptian Army, who nearly annihilated the Sudanese after a five-hour fight. The Emir was killed trying to rally his men and only 800 Mahdist warriors escaped. Apart from the officers commanding the Egyptian units, the only British troops participating were a squadron of the 20th Hussars. This battle demonstrated the fighting qualities of the reformed Egyptian Army, including the newly raised Sudanese units that made up four of the six infantry battalions present, and effectively ended the Mahdist threat to Egypt.

Born in Saviano, near Naples, he has worked for several newspapers and satirical magazines, including L'Unit√†, Il Manifesto, Tango, and Cuore, usually about episodes of his life as a high school teacher. He also works as screenwriter. Movies La scuola, The Ties (both by Daniele Luchetti), Auguri Professore (by Riccardo Milani) and Denti (by Gabriele Salvatores) are based on his books. One of his fictional books is Via Gemito, which won the Premio Strega in 2001. It was suggested in 2006 The author points out marked similarities in style between the two writers, also supported by computer analysis. that the mysterious writer Elena Ferrante, author of L'amore molesto and I giorni dell'abbandono, is Starnone himself. In a collection of interviews, the Frantumaglia: A Writer's Journey, Ferrante addresses these speculations; she writes that in relation to the speculation that Ferrante is likely to be Starnone, due to her anonymity, and his feeling 'tired of everyone asking if he's Ferrante', she expresses 'That he's right and I feel guilty. But I hold him in great esteem and I'm certain that he understands my motivations. My identity, my sex can be found in my writing. Everything that has sprouted up around that is yet more evidence of the character of Italians in the first years of the twenty-first century.' Starnone is married to Anita Raja, the literary translator who was said to be the author Elena Ferrante in a report by the Italian investigative journalist Claudio Gatti in 2016. In 2017 an international research has compared the language of the mysterious novelist with 150 novels, revealing singular similarities with Starnone. The same research team doesn't rule out that Ferrante's novels are the result of the collaboration between Starnone and his wife Anita Raja.

She is also the Principal Investigator of the Positive Emotions and Psychophysiology Lab (PEPLab) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Barbara Fredrickson at the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, 2019 Fredrickson is a social psychologist who conducts research in emotions and positive psychology. Her main work is related to her broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, which suggests that positive emotions lead to novel, expansive, or exploratory behavior, and that, over time, these actions lead to meaningful, long-term resources such as knowledge and social relationships. She is the author of Positivity: Top-Notch Research Reveals the 3-to-1 Ratio That Will Change Your Life (2009), a general-audience book that draws on her own research and that of other social scientists. The book's thesis is largely drawn from her work with Marcial Losada, claiming a mathematical ratio for happiness. The ratio, however, was, \\"based on a series of erroneous and, for the most part, completely illusory 'applications' of mathematics.\\" Fredrickson was unable to reproduce the math behind her research published with Losada and has yet to disavow or apologize for the fraud. In a later response, the mathematical models for the paper were formally withdrawn. Research Broaden-and- build Central to many existing theories of emotion is the concept of specific-action tendencies ‚Äì the idea that emotions prepare the body both physically and psychologically to act in particular ways. For example, anger creates the urge to attack, fear causes an urge to escape and disgust leads to the urge to expel. From this framework, positive emotions posed a puzzle. Emotions like joy, serenity and gratitude don‚Äôt seem as useful as fear, anger or disgust. The bodily changes, urges to act and the facial expressions produced by positive emotions are not as specific or as obviously relevant to survival as those sparked by negative emotions. If positive emotions didn‚Äôt promote our ancestors‚Äô survival in life-threatening situations, then what good were they? How did they survive evolutionary pressures? Did they have any adaptive value at all? Barbara Fredrickson developed the Broaden-and-Build Theory of Positive EmotionsFredrickson, B. L. (2001). The role of positive emotions in positive psychology: The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions. American Psychologist, 56, 218-226. to explain the mechanics of how positive emotions were important to survival. Positivity/negativity ratio Fredrickson's 2005 paper, co-authored with Marcial Losada, argued that there exist precise values of an individual's emotional positivity-to- negativity ratio, outside of which they will fail to flourish.Fredrickson, B. L. & Losada, M. F. (2005). Positive affect and the complex dynamics of human flourishing. American Psychologist, 60, 678‚Äì686. Fredrickson and Losada's use of nonlinear dynamics modelling, taken from fluid dynamics, to derive these values, has been strongly criticised by Nicholas Brown, Alan Sokal, and Harris Friedman, who point out numerous fundamental mathematical errors in the article (see Losada line). Fredrickson has agreed that the mathematical modelling is \\"questionable\\", but stands by the more general idea that a high emotional positivity-to-negativity ratio is beneficial.Fredrickson, B. L. (2013). Updated thinking on positivity ratios. American Psychologist, 68, 814-822. The whole theory of the critical positivity ratio was discredited by Nicholas Brown, Alan Sokal, and Harris Friedman, in a 2013 article published in American Psychologist,Brown, N. J. L., Sokal, A. D., & Friedman, H. L. (2013). The Complex Dynamics of Wishful Thinking: The Critical Positivity Ratio. American Psychologist. Electronic publication ahead of print. the same journal in which Fredrickson's original findings were published in 2005. Brown et al. argue that Losada's conclusions in previous papers using modelling from fluid dynamics, and those in his paper co-authored with Fredrickson, are not only based on poorly-reported experiments ‚Äì they argue that it is difficult to draw any conclusions from some previous studies by Losada because critical details are omitted, and \\"interpretations of results are made with little or no justification\\" (p. 5) ‚Äì but are based on elementary errors in the use of differential equations. The undoing effect Fredrickson and others hypothesize that positive emotions undo the cardiovascular effects of negative emotions. When people experience stress, they show increased heart rate, higher blood sugar, immunosuppression, and other adaptations optimized for immediate action. If individuals do not regulate these changes once the stress is past, they can lead to illness, such as coronary disease, and heightened mortality. Both lab research and survey research indicate that positive emotions help people who were previously under stress relax back to their physiological baseline.Fredrickson, B. L., Mancuso, R. A., Branigan, C., & Tugade, M. M. (2000). The undoing effect of positive emotions. Motivation and Emotion, 24, 237-258. Past research has shown that anger, fear and sadness each elicit distinct responses in the autonomic nervous system. In direct contrast, the positive emotions appeared to have no distinguishable autonomic responses. Positive emotions do not themselves generate cardiovascular reactivity, but instead quell any existing cardiovascular reactivity caused by negative emotions. Put differently, a prior state of negative emotional arousal may be a necessary backdrop to illuminate the cardiovascular impact of positive emotions. Assuming (as most emotion theorists do) that the cardiovascular reactivity sparked by certain negative emotions prepares the body for specific actions, the broaden-and-build theory suggests that positive emotions can speed recovery from‚Äîor undo‚Äîthis cardiovascular reactivity and return the body to mid-range levels of activation suitable for pursuing a wider range of behavioral options.Fredrickson, B. L. & Levenson, R. W. (1998). Positive emotions speed recovery from the cardiovascular sequelae of negative emotions. Cognition and Emotion, 12, 191-220. According to this view, positive emotions have a unique ability to down-regulate lingering negative emotions and the psychological and physiological states they generate. In one of the studies, they gave participants an acute stressor ‚Äì the possibility of giving a public speech. As participants prepare for this speech their bodies exhibit increased sympathetic nervous system activation (sweaty palms, increased heart rate, increased blood pressure). After a minute or so of this heightened state of arousal, participants learn that they don‚Äôt have to give the speech after all and instead view a randomly assigned video clip that generates a positive or negative emotion, or a state of neutrality. Fredrickson and colleagues measured the amount of time it took each person to recover from the anxiety about the possible speech. Results indicated that positive emotions led to a quicker return to a resting state than neutral or negative emotions. This is called the undoing effect. Sex differences in self-objectification Prior to her work on positive emotions, Fredrickson researched social and environmental cues that can carry sexist messages and enhance stereotypical gender differences. She found that when women are randomly assigned dress in a way that calls attention to their bodies, they show impaired performance on a math task and were literally more likely to \\"throw like a girl\\". This research suggested that drawing attention to women's bodies also activated stereotypical beliefs about their gender.Fredrickson, B. L. Roberts, T., Noll, S. M., Quinn, D. M., & Twenge, J. M. (1998). That swimsuit becomes you: Sex differences in self-objectification, restrained eating and math performance. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 75, 269-284. She has also contributed to research for the Objectification Theory which posits that women internalize an outsider's point of view when viewing themselves and their bodies. She argues that this objectification of women's bodies may have contributed to the high prevalence of mental health risks that plague women. Loving-kindness meditation As a means to test the build hypothesis, central to the broad-and-build theory, Fredrickson and colleagues assessed the impact of learning to self-generate positive emotions by learning loving- kindness meditation (LKM), an ancient Buddhist mind-training practice. A paper published in 2008 showed that LKM produces enduring increases in positive emotions, which in turn builds a range of consequential personal resources that augment life satisfaction and curb depressive symptoms.Fredrickson, B. L., Cohn, M. A., Coffey, K. A., Pek, J., & Finkel, S. M. (2008). Open hearts build lives: Positive emotions, induced through loving-kindness meditation, build consequential personal resources. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 95, 1045-1062. A paper published in 2013 also shows that LKM, by increasing positive emotions and perceived positive social connections, improves cardiovascular health. Kok, B. E., Coffey, K. A., Cohn, M. A., Catalino, L. I., Vacharkulksemsuk, T., Algoe, S. B., Brantley, M., & Fredrickson, B. L. (2013). How positive emotions build physical health: Perceived positive social connections account for the upward spiral between positive emotions and vagal tone. Psychological Science, 24, 1123-1132. Recognition Fredrickson received the American Psychological Association‚Äôs inaugural Templeton Prize in Positive Psychology in 2000 for her work on the broaden-and-build theory, which included a $100,000 grant to fund her work. Her work has been supported continuously for the past 16 years by grants from the National Institutes of Health. She also received the Society of Experimental Social Psychology‚Äôs Career Trajectory Award in 2008. She was awarded the inaugural Christopher Peterson Gold Medal in 2013. In November of 2017, Fredrikson was awarded the Toronto-based TANG Foundation's Prize for Psychology, including a $100,000 (Canadian) grant. Selected publications * Fredrickson, Barbara (2009).

He was born in Kato Drys, Cyprus 13 March 1913 and left for Great Britain in 1928, aged 14. He started selling his mother's handmade lace door-to-door and gradually headed north, settling in Glasgow. By the 1940s, Stakis was involved in his first restaurant, the Victory in Glasgow, whose affordable prices began to change the way Scottish people dined out. By the 1960s, he had a chain of thirty restaurants and hotels throughout Scotland. In 1962, he bought the Dunblane Hydro Hotel, which was run-down yet within six months he had returned it to profit. Stakis was to make his home in the grounds of that hotel. Stakis opened Scotland's first casino, the Chevalier, in 1964 and gradually added several other casinos to the Stakis group. However, his flagship hotel, The Grosvenor, was destroyed by fire in 1978. He was knighted in 1988. By that time Stakis' son Andros had taken over the business and in difficult trading conditions, some poor decisions brought the company close to bankruptcy. However, new management brought renewed profitability and Stakis was able to sell his empire to the Hilton Group for ¬£1.2 billion in 1999. He was Chairman of Stakis plc from 1947‚Äì1991, and President 1986-1999. He married Annitsa Petropoulos in 1946, and they had two sons and four daughters. Stakis was a generous benefactor to the Greek Orthodox church in Glasgow, buying both their first church in the city in 1953 and their Cathedral of St Luke the Evangelistes in 1960. Stakis died in Stirling on 28 August 2001. He is buried in Dunblane Cemetery. Scottish journalist Jack Webster wrote his biography Stakis: The Reo Stakis Story.

Though using the title of the ninth novel in the series, it actually is based on numerous elements from throughout the series to that point, cherry-picked by the writers. It starred Henry Brandon, William Royle and Robert Kellard. It was directed by the legendary serial team of William Witney and John English and is often considered one of the best movie serials ever made. Plot Fu Manchu attempts to conquer the world by acquiring the sceptre of Genghis Khan, which will unite the people of Asia under his rule. Allan Parker allies himself with the traditional British literary nemeses of Fu Manchu, Sir Denis Nayland Smith and his associate, Dr. Flinders Petrie after his father is kidnapped and killed by Fu Manchu's dacoits. Cast *Henry Brandon as Fu Manchu *William Royle as Sir Denis Nayland Smith *Robert Kellard as Allan Parker *Gloria Franklin as Fah Lo Suee *Olaf Hytten as Dr. Flinders Petrie *Tom Chatterton as Professor Edward Randolph *Luana Walters as Mary Randolph *John Merton as Loki *Dwight Frye as Professor Anderson *Lal Chand Mehra as Sirdar Prahni Production Drums of Fu Manchu was budgeted at $164,052 although the final negative cost was $166,312 (a $2,260, or 1.4%, overspend). It was the most expensive Republic serial of 1940, although this year was the first in which Republic's overall spending on serial production was less than in the previous year. Republic spent $597,528 producing serials in 1940 compared to $648,064 in 1939 (1939's total would not be beaten until the $782,204 of 1944). The studio produced four serials in each year, with the same mix of two 12-chapter serials and two 15-chapter serials. The serial was filmed between December 22, 1939 and February 7, 1940, the longest filming period of any Republic serial. The serial's production number was 995. Directors Witney and English, working with photographer William Nobles, stressed the elements of mystery in the plot over the usual action. Strong use of shadows was made with \\"the eeriest lighting possible falling upon Fu Manchu.\\" It was one of the very rare films made under the US Motion Picture Production Code to allow the villain to escape at the end. According to serial expert Alan Barbour, the Hays Office accepted the explanation that Fu Manchu always \\"got away\\" at the end of his novels to wreak further havoc in the next adventure, and Republic may well have been considering follow-ups. Release Drums of Fu Manchu's official release date is March 15, 1940, although this is actually the date the seventh chapter was made available to film exchanges. A 69-minute feature film version of the same name was created by editing the serial footage together and released on November 27, 1943. The feature version had the working titles Fu Manchu and Fu Manchu Strikes . It was one of fourteen feature films Republic made from their serials. This version changed the ending of the film. Fu Manchu's escape at the end is edited out and he dies in the final car crash instead. A similar change was made in the feature version of the Victory Pictures serial Shadow of Chinatown . Home video The complete serial was released on region 1 DVD in the US by VCI Entertainment on February 25, 2003. Critical reception Harmon and Glut regard Drums of Fu Manchu as one of Republic's best film serials. Brandon as Fu Manchu is, in Cline's opinion, \\"a performance that stands alone.\\" Hans J. Wollstein, writing at Allmovie, concurs that Drums of Du Fu Manchu is \\"one of [Republic's] very best\\" serials. He does, however, note mistakes such as the misspelling of \\"Ghengis Khan\\" and Fu Manchu referring to Mary Randolph as \\"Miss Parker\\" but considers them part of the charm of the serial. In terms of acting, Brandon is a \\"compelling and strangely ageless fiend\\" while Kellard is \\"competent as the action hero.\\" Witney and English are afforded the usual praise for their work.

It was compiled and released in 2002, two years after Dury's death in March 2000. Background The album came to be after Ian Dury's second wife Sophy found a list of songs under the title 'Ten More Turnips from the Tip' among her husband's papers. The list, described as 'almost like a will' by Blockheads keyboardist Mick Gallagher in Ian Dury & The Blockheads: Song By Song, included four tracks recorded at RAK Studios in October 1999 amidst other titles that presumably included some that were not recorded. Sophy gave this list to Chaz Jankel and gave her blessing for the Blockheads to finish the album. However, it is unlikely the final album corresponds to this list as the Blockheads were only allowed limited access to Dury's songs by his estate and many of the songs were revamped tracks from the early 1990s with additional overdubs by the Blockheads. \\"Dance Little Rude Boy\\" would have definitely been on the list though as it was one of the songs recorded at RAK (it would later be released as a single). An initially sceptical Laurie Latham was brought in to produce the album's assembly. Latham had worked on a good number of Ian Dury's albums, including all of his Stiff Records work. Although Latham disliked albums of out-takes and demos put together after the artist's death (a common occurrence in the music business) he was eventually won over by the quality of the songs. Latham is responsible for a number of small edits to the songs, for instance, he swapped the beginning for the ending on \\"Cowboys\\" and added the small sound bite of Dury sipping tea on \\"The Ballad of The Sulphate Strangler\\". Two songs were written by Dury so late in his life that he was too ill to even record guide vocals for them. \\"I Could Lie\\" was the last Ian Dury & the Blockheads song written and as Dury was weak from his illness, Jankel recorded both the demo version and final version. Jankel would also have performed lead vocals on \\"You're the Why\\", but when it was played at Dury's funeral Robbie Williams offered to sing it if it were ever recorded. In contrast \\"I Believe\\", \\"Cowboys\\" and \\"One Love\\" date back to the recording sessions at Sonnet Studios for The Bus Driver's Prayer & Other Stories in 1991. Dury's brother-in-law Jake Tilson designed the album's sleeve and booklet. Fans contributed a number of the items and tickets pictured within it amongst various paintings, including one by Ian Dury himself (of Chaz Jankel), Ian by Peter Blake and Lady & Beast Adorned by Terry Day. Jock Scott, Sophy Dury and Humphrey Ocean (a former member of Kilburn and the High Roads, Dury's pub rock band in the mid 1970s) were responsible for other pieces while the front featured a photograph of Dury as a child, in a pram being pushed by his father William Dury, with their dog Bella. Following a surprising lack of record company interest, negotiations with lawyers and Dury's accountant Ronnie Harris delayed the release of the album by six months but it was greeted by warm reviews and tracks from the album remain in the Blockheads live sets to this day.

His father, who had come to England from France following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, died soon afterwards and he was brought up by his uncle, who placed him at Westminster School. There he studied under Dr Desaguliers, who taught him mathematics and natural philosophy. After that he went to the Leiden University. In 1727 he married; his wife died in 1750. From 1740 to 1742 he lectured in experimental philosophy in Edinburgh. The 1745 Jacobite Rising brought him to take arms for the government for four years, and he was a volunteer at the Battle of Prestonpans. In 1746 he resumed his lectures, and worked on the influence of electricity on vegetables. Three years later, he began travelling throughout Britain and Europe, lecturing in Dublin and Paris. In 1753, he was invited to London by the Prince of Wales, later George III, and the Duke of York. On his return to England he married his second wife, Sarah Horne, who was a sister of John Horne Tooke. In 1755 he read a public course of lectures in the concert-room in Panton Street, and later gave private courses to members of the royal family, including the future King George III. In 1768, he was appointed Superintendent of the King's Observatory (or King's Astronomer) in Richmond, which King George III had commissioned from Sir William Chambers. He arranged for George III to see the Transit of Venus on 3 June 1769. He held that appointment until his death on 20 February 1782. His assistant there was James Stephen Rigaud, who married Demainbray's daughter Mary in Richmond in 1771. His instruments were combined with the King's collection and given to King's College London and then, in 1927, to the Science Museum.

Basque rural sports, known as Deportes Rurales in Spanish or Herri Kirolak in Basque, is the term used for a number of sports competitions rooted in the traditional lifestyles of the Basque people. The term force basque is used in French. Virtually all regional Basque rural sports have their origin in the two main historical occupations, the or baserritarra (farmer) and arrantzalea (fisher), with a larger percentage hailing from the rural background. The sociological changes in the Basque Country have led many of these becoming technically obsolete in the 19th and 20th century. Few continue to exist as rural or marine activities connected to everyday life and have become rare but many have managed to transform themselves into popular sports instead, some of which have become extremely popular. Winners receive a Basque beret (boina or txapela) as a trophy, hence the Basque word for \\"champion\\" - txapeldun, literally \\"one who has a beret\\". Betting, both by the competitors and the audience, is very common and popular at such sporting events in the north of Spain. The H18K rural sports In 2006 the Basque Government identified 18 particular rural sports, called H18K, in its Strategic Plan for promotion. These 18 categories are (in alphabetical order): Aizkora proba (wood chopping) Literally \\"axe test\\", this rural sport more commonly known as aizkolaritza, from the Basque word for a wood- cutter. This is a very popular sport today but its origins are to be found in the rural wood cutting and charcoal burning communities of earlier periods. In this competition, the wood cutter has to chop through a number of tree trunks arranged on the ground in rows as quickly as possible while standing on the log to beat his competitors. This sport is often seen in summer at local festivities and open-air dances, held in towns all over the country. Giza- abere probak (dragging games) 11 people dragging a 4-ton stone in Eibar in 1940 This sport translates as Human-animal tests and is a collective term for a number of sports in which humans and animals are involved in dragging heavy weights. There are four main categories: *Giza probak (human tests) where people attempt to drag a heavy weight, usually a large rock, across a certain distance *Zaldi probak (horse tests) - same as giza probak but with horses *Idi probak (oxen tests) - same as giza probak but with oxen *Asto probak (donkey tests) - same as giza probak but with donkeys These normally take place on specially built trial grounds. The aim is to cover a certain distance within a given time or to cover as many circuits as possible. The idi probak are by far the most popular in this category. Harri jasotzea (stone lifting) The lifting of stones is one of the most widely known Basque rural sport outside the Basque Country, largely thanks to the prowess of I√±aki Perurena, a harrijasotzaile (stone-lifter) from Leitza, in Navarre, the first on record to lift stone over 300 kg. There are usually two stone-lifters competing in each event, taking turns in one or several attempts, to perform the greatest possible number of lifts. A lift is considered complete when the stone has been properly balanced on the shoulder. The four types of stone most frequently used are rectangular, cylindrical, spherical and square and were established at the beginning of the 20th century. The stones are traditionally made of granite, their weight normally ranging from 100 kg to 212 kg. Together with aizkolaritza (wood chopping), stone lifting is another example a widely performed rural sport at local festivities all over the Basque Country. Harri zulaketa (hole drilling) Harri zulaketa competition The hole drilling competition involves having to grind holes into a rock. Teams of three compete against each other. They take turns in using a long metal pole (called laztabin) to punch and drill a hole into a large rock upon which they are standing, pouring water onto the working area while the third person gets to rest. This tradition goes back to the quarrying activities around the Basque Country, in particular in Biscay. In Spanish it is called barrenadores \\"drillers\\" and occasionally barrenatzaileak (drillers, from the Spanish word) in Basque as well. Ingude altxatzea (anvil lifting) Bittor Zabala in an anvil lifting competition in Eibar in 1928 The lifting of anvils requires competitors to lift an iron anvil or ingude weighing 18 kg 30 cm above the height of their own head as many times as possible in a set time period. The anvil has the shape of an obtuse triangle with a stump at one point or an elongated T and is traditionally used in shoeing horses. Champions manage some 80 lifts in 2 minutes. In Spanish this is called alzamiento de yunque and in French lever d'enclume. Lasto altxatzea (bale lifting) Hay-bale lifting Literally hay bale lifting, this sport involves raising a hay-bale with the aid of a pulley. The competition is usually about lifting the bale as often as possible within a given period of time, most commonly 2 minutes. The bale weighs 45 kg in the men's competitions and 30 kg in the women's competition. The most difficult part is to get the bale to the required height for the first time. Once that has been achieved, the competitors allow the bale to drop in free fall, grabbing the rope and jumping up at the appropriate moment to use their own body weight to lift the bale again when coming down. A lot of skill is needed to avoid rope burn. The visual appearance is not dissimilar to swinging on a church bell rope. In Spanish this is called levantamiento de fardo and in French lever de paille. Lasto botatzea (bale tossing) Hay bale tossing in Barakaldo Hay bale tossing is related to lasto altxatzea. Here the hay-bales have to be thrown over a bar set a certain height with the help of a pitchfork. For men the height is normally 7m, for women 5m and the bale has to hit a bell for the toss to be valid. This sport is very similar to the Scottish sheaf toss. In Spanish this is called lanzamiento de fardo. Lokotx biltzea (cob gathering) In cob gathering competitions, also called buskail biltzea, cobs are placed at 1.25m distances in a line, 25 in a line at the most. The game can be played to 50, 75 or 100 cobs in which case they are placed in sets of 2, 3 or 4. The competitors have to collect these in order (the nearest first) and place them into a basket at one end of the row of cobs. It is called recogida de mazorcas in Spanish and course des √©pis de ma√Øs in French. Ontzi eramatea (churn carrying) The churn carrying competition usually involves milk-cans and is very similar to the txinga eramatea competition. Competitors have to carry a 41 kg milk-churn in each hand as far as possible. This game is also called esneketariak \\"milk carrying\\" or ontziketariak \\"can carrying\\". Orga jokoa (cart game) Orga joko The \\"oxcart game\\" is a display of strength. Contestants have to lift the back of an ox cart weighing 360 kg 40 cm above ground. The cart is pivoted to the ground at the front end and competitors must rotate it, trying to go around as many times as possible. It is also called andartza in Basque. In Spanish this is called levantamiento de carro and in French lever de charette. Sega jokoa (scything) Literally \\"scythe game\\", this sport is also known as segalariak (scythers), sega proba (scythe test), sega apustua (scythe bet) or segalaritza (scything). The earliest record of this sport comes from a bertso dating back to 1880 about a competition in Iturriotz. In this sport competitors (called segalari) either compete to cut the most grass in a given period of time (usually one hour) or they are each given plots of grass of the same size and the competition is to see who can scythe theirs the fastest. Today the competition usually lasts one hour but two-hour competitions also are still held. At the end, the grass is raked, weighed and baled to establish the winner. Traditionally, as with most Basque sports, the competitors would make a profit by betting but monetary prizes have been put up since the 1950s. There are few actual records in this sport as it very much depends on the terrain and is thus difficult to compare. But a number of segalari have achieved fame nonetheless, for example the legendary Pedro Maria Ota√±o Ezeitza, commonly known as Santa Ageda from Beizama who was also an aizkolari and competed up until 1915. Another famed event was the competition of 1925 in Iturriotz when, before a crowd of 6000, Pedro Mendizabal from Aia and Jose Arrieta from Urnieta battled each other. Legend has it that more than 150,000 pesetas in bets were placed. Mendizabal won, cutting 4294 kg of grass in two hours against his rival's 3957 kg. The use of scythes is still widespread today as many pastures are too steep for modern farm machinery so scythes are used to cut grass or bracken. Working scythes have blades between 0.9-0.95m long but competition scythes range from 1.18-1.24m in length. A decent segalari can manage some 5000m2 in a day. In Spanish this is simply called siega. Sokatira (tug-of-war) Tug-of-war is also traditional in the Basque Country. Usually two teams of eight compete, trying to drag the other team over a line by pulling on the rope. There are free competitions in which the weight of the competitors is ignored and more structured events where there are weight categories of 525 kg, 560 kg, 640 kg and 720 kg per team. Juvenile teams are always under 560 kg. Three lines are marked on the ground, a middle line and parallel to that at 2m distance two more. The maximum length of the rope is 32m with a circumference between 10-12.5 cm. There are 5 markers on the rope, a red marker in the middle, 2m away from the red marker on either side are white markers and 5m on either side of those are blue markers. The aim is for a team to get the opposing team's blue marker over the team's own 2m line. Hands must always be on the rope and it may not be supported with any other part of the body or allowed to slacken. Only the last member of the team is allowed to wind the rope around their body. In Spanish this is called sogatira and in French tir √† la corde. Trontza (sawing) Sawing competitions, also called trontzalaritza or arpana, are seen as a variation of aizkolaritza and involve sawing through pieces of wood. The log is either fixed horizontally on sawhorses at a height of 40 cm or at an angle with one end over the sawhorse and two members of the sawing team sitting on the lower end to stabilise the log, with two other handling the saw. The saw is usually 2 m long, the logs vary but can be over 1 m in circumference and usually between 10-20 in number. In Spanish this is called corte de troncos con tronza or just tronza and in French scieur de bois. Txinga eramatea (weight carrying) In the weight carrying competition weights have to be carried in both hands as far as possible. There usually is no time limit but the weights weigh between 50‚Äì100 kg each and may not be put down or supported by any other part of the body. Competitors may hold them only by the rope handles and are not allowed to put their hands through the handles. It is possible for competitors to bring their own, favourite weights, but they are checked by judges beforehand. The aim is to complete as many plaza of 28m as possible. Competitors each set their own pace and may stop (without putting the weights down). Champions typically manage 400‚Äì500m. It is similar to the churn carrying competition. The word eramatea variously shows up in dialect forms such as erutea or eroatea. In Spanish this is called prueba de txingas or carreras marmitas. Zaku eramatea (sack carrying) The sack carrying, also called zaku lasterketa (sack race) requires participants to have both speed and stamina. It usually takes the form of a relay race in teams of 3 where the runners have to carry heavy sacks across their shoulders. Depending on the area, the sacks contain a variety of things from bread to beans and usually weigh 60 kg, 75 kg or 80 kg. In Spanish this is called carreras de contrabandistas (\\"smugglers' runs\\") or carrera con saco and in French course de sac. Other rural sports The above categories included in the H18K group aside, there are a number of other rural and traditional Basque sports, some of which are extremely popular both in and outside the Basque Country. Some are indigenous, some also occur in areas adjacent to the Basque country or other cultures around the world. Ahari topeka (ram fighting) Basque ram- fighting in the square of Eibar in 1937 Ram fights, also variously called ahari apustuak (ram bets) and ahari talka (ram bump) are very popular around the Urola basin in towns like Azpeitia (between October and June) and Arroa. They test the strength and endurance of the rams, using their natural inclination to fight other rams. The rams are trained and fed on a variety of secret diets involving things like beans, apples, red wine, carrots or egg yolk.Ahari-apustuak: herri kirolen bitxikeria A basic fight goes over at least 8 ekintaldi (attacks), also called kintze (from Spanish quince \\"15\\"), with the best of 8 winning. To score a point, a ram has to land a square hit on his opponent's head or horns. If the ram runs away at the start, the owner is allowed to bring him back into the ring once. There are records of bets over 100 attacks but these are rare now. Although the strongest rams are said to come from the Aralar Mendilerroa mountain range between Gipuzkoa and Navarre, they are also said to be too placid so the preference is for rams from the region around Urbasa, Andia and Gorbeia. The Basque Government controversially banned the Iurreta ahari topekas in 2007 on animal welfare grounds.El Gobierno vasco proh√≠be las peleas de carneros en Iurreta. El Correo This sport is called peleas de carneros in Spanish. Aitzur jaurtiketa (hoe throwing) A game of throwing hoes. In Spanish this is called lanzamiento de azada, in French as lancer de houe. Antzar jokoa (goose game) There are two variations of this game depending on whether it is played at a seaside town or inland. In a seaside town, a long rope is suspended between a pole on the quay and the mast of a boat. A dead goose (previously live geese were used too) is suspended head down in the middle of the rope. Teams now have to row out and a designated person must jump up, grab the goose, hang on to it and try to remove the head before falling off. At the same time, sailors at both ends of the rope try their best to shake the person clinging to the goose off. The team that collects the most heads wins. Inland, the rope is suspended over the ground and the same goal must be achieved from horseback. The most famous of these is held in Lekeitio on Antzar Eguna (goose day), held between the 1‚Äì8 September goes back at least to the year 1877 when it was played only by sailors. It has also been celebrated on other days in other villages, sometimes (for example in Gernika) using chicken instead of geese. In Spanish this is called juego de gansos and in French as jeu d'oie. Ardi ile moztea (sheep shearing) Sheep shearing also features in Basque rural sports and works along similar lines as other sheep shearing contests. Ardi ile moztea translates as \\"the shearing of sheep's wool\\" and it is also known as ardi moztea \\"sheep shearing\\". Asto arineketan (donkey races) Similar to horse racing but with donkeys. Blankolari (shooting) Shotgun shooting is particularly popular in the area around Eibar in the Basque Country. In Spanish this is called punter√≠a con escopeta, in French as comp√©tition avec escopette. Bola jokoa (bowls) Basques have also their own variants of dirt-track and lawn bowls.Bola jokoa/El juego de bolos, exhibition brochure compiled by Juan Jos√© Zorrilla for the Culture Section of the Foral Government of Biscay, Bilbao, 2006, . There is a large number of variations of the game but most are similar to skittles and centre around a set of pins that must be knocked down with a ball. Espadrila jaurtiketa (espadrilles tossing) A game of throwing espadrilles, a kind of shoe with a straw sole. In Spanish this is called lanzamiento de alpargata, in French as lancer d'espadrille . Estropadak (rowing competitions) Competing for the Kontxako Bandera. A very popular rowing competition all along the coast of the Bay of Biscay and the Northern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. This sport hails back to the days when fishermen had to reach fishing grounds quickly and return to port as quickly as possible to achieve the best price. The crew is made up of thirteen oarsmen and the cox, who faces them at the stern. The boats are called traineru (trainera in Spanish), and are derived from 19th century fishing boats. The most important competition in the Bay of Biscay in summer takes place the first two Sundays in September: the Kontxako Bandera, where the best teams compete against each other, following a tradition which is over a hundred years old. There is a regatta in almost every seaside town between July and October. Goitibeherak (soapbox cars) In the Basque Country the tradition of building soapbox cars goes back at least to the early 20th century. The name is a contraction of goitik-behera which means \\"from the top to the bottom\\". Unlike most European soapbox cars, the goitibeherak are three- wheelers and the early versions simply consisted of a triangular frame on three wheels or even scavenged ball bearings with a plank to sit upon, which children would race down the slopes found in many Basque towns. The earliest documented races date back to the mid-1970s, when races were held during local festivals. The first Basque national competition was held in 1976, and they are common events all over the Basque Country today. One of the biggest events, the Goitibehera Munduko Txapelketa (World Goitibehera Championship) was first held in 1985 in Pamplona during the San Ferm√≠nes and has been held at irregular intervals since, the last time on 28 June 2008 when the IX World Championship was held. The normal soapbox races are called carreras de carrilanas in Spanish but this version is called goitiberas even in Spanish. They occur in the Basque Country and Uruguay to where they were exported by Basque emigrants. Igel jokoa (frog game) The frog game The frog game is a pub game played both in the Basque Country and outside. In the Basque Country, it is commonly played in Basque sagardotegiak (cider houses) and taverns. The aim of the game is to score as many points as possible by throwing ten metal discs at a chest. The chest can be placed at a range of distances away from the players, usually 8‚Äì15 paces. On top of the chest, there is an iron frog with an open mouth, a mill, and a bridge. Underneath are more empty compartments. In most variants, a player who manages to hit the frog's mouth is awarded 50 points; 25 points are awarded for getting the disc under the mill, 10 for the bridge, and 5 for any of the compartments below. Other scoring systems also exist. Some frog chests have obstacles built into the frog, mill, and bridge to make the game more difficult. Discs that have hit any mark are collected at the back of the chest via a set of metal tubes. In Spanish, this game is called juego de la rana in Spain and Chile, juego de sapo in Peru and Argentina, tiro al sapo in Bolivia, and just rana in Colombia. In French, it is referred to as jeu de la grenouille. In England, it is known as toad in the hole. Korrika (racing) Also a popular sport in the Basque country. There are broadly speaking two categories: *races held in bullrings where a circle with a 15m radius. Competitors try to complete a set number of laps as fast as possible. *cross country races, usually of more than 10 km. A highly popular race, the Korrika, is held once a year in aid of Basque schools and crosses all parts of the Basque Country. The goal is not competition, but the raising of funds and awareness. A variant of the korrika are the ibiltariak (walkers), a fast walking race that was particularly popular in Navarre in the 19th and 20th century with the walkers wearing the abarketa, a traditional Basque leather shoe, and a hazel stick. The traditional forms of running korrika have been largely supplanted by modern forms of running and racing. Kukaina (yard climbing) Greasing the Cockaigne pole for the Tomatina in Bu√±ol, Valencia. This variant of the Neapolitan greasy pole game is usually played on a yard that is suspended horizontally over water. A piece of cloth is attached to the far end of the yard and competitors have to try to reach it and retrieve it. A variant uses a greased vertical pole. It can also be spelled kuka√±a, a word which derives from the Spanish word cuca√±a (Cockaigne), in French monter du m√¢t. Laiariak (laia competitions) Hernani region|left This is a competition involving the laia, a farming implement that resembles a two-pronged heavy pichtfork with an off-centre handle, either with a long or short handle. Traditionally four or five members of either gender of a baserri family are picked to compete as a team, the task being to turn over a plot of land as quickly as possible. A variation of this is laia lasterketa, a laia race where the competitors stand on a pair of laiak and race, not dissimilar to a race on stilts. The laia was a very widespread instrument used to loosen soil. With the advent of modern farming machinery, its use is now restricted to area machines cannot reach, for example on high slopes, and kitchen gardens. In Spanish this is called layadores or layar, in French as b√™cher. Makil tira (stick pulling) In this game, two players sit on the ground with their feet touching, separated by a plank. Both players also hold onto a makila, and the aim is to lift one's opponent to their feet. In Spanish this is called Tiro del palo, in French as tir au b√¢ton. Oilar jokoa (chicken game) This term in Basque covers two sorts of chicken games: *cockfighting, which was outlawed in 1926. *a game where a chicken is buried to the neck and blindfolded. Competitors, themselves blindfolded too, have to locate the chicken guided by the music of a txistulari or drummer. In the old days the goal was to remove the head from the chicken once it was located but when played today, it is sufficient to touch the head. The most famous oilar jokoa is held in Legazpi in June today but the game used to be more widespread. Palanka jaurtiketa (metal bar throwing) The throwing of a metal bar was once one of the most popular and widespread of Basque sports. Its popularity waned during the 19th century. Having died out in most areas, it survived the longest in parts of Gipuzkoa until its ultimate demise in the 20th century. The palankari (thrower) throws a palanka, a traditional mining tool weighing between 8‚Äì25 kg as far as possible. Various throwing techniques were employed, most involving the palankari twisting around before launching the palanka. Some techniques by name are: *bueltaerdiz \\"with half a turn\\" *bularretik \\"from the chest\\" *hankartetik \\"from between the legs\\" The origins of this sport are in the mining industry where the palanka was traditionally used to prepare the holes into which explosives were then placed from the 15th century onwards. As a pastime, the miners would see who could throw the heavy tool the furthest in their breaks. Curiously, the Spanish athlete Miguel de la Quadra-Salcedo used a javelin throwing technique based on the Basque techniques of throwing the palanka at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. Initially breaking the world record in javelin throwing, his record was later annulled when the IAAF amended its rules to exclude techniques that at any point in time involve the athlete or the javelin face or point towards the audience. In Spanish this is called lanzamiento de barra or barra vasca and in French lancement de bar de mine. Pegarra lasterketa (pitcher race) Basques carrying pegarras in the 18th century. This sport involves a pitcher variously called :eu:pegarra, bera, :es:pedarra and kantarue in Basque. It is a traditional ceramic pitcher that resembles a fat teapot, with a diameter at the base of around 20 cm, a lid on the top with about 10 cm diameter and about 30 cm tall and a fairly large spout. It can either be glazed or unglazed, with one or three handles (if it was designed to be hung) that was traditionally used to carry water. It is carried on a head cushion called burutea and the aim of a race is to get to the finish line without dropping the pegarra. It is difficult to ascertain how old the sport is but one of the earliest records of the pegarra being used to carry water on the head dates back to a Dutch book from 1603 called Theatrum Orbis Terrarum by Abraham Ortelius which has an illustration of a Basque woman carrying a pegarra. In Spanish this is called carrera de pedarras and in French course de pedarras.  Esku Pilota (Basque pelota) Playing pilota with wooden bats. The Basque sport best known outside the Basque Country is Basque pelota. It is a Basque version of the family of ball games that covers squash, tennis, and real tennis, all of them thought to derive from the Jeu de paume and hence a relative of Valencian pilota. But the main innovation of Basque pilota is that players share a common playground and throw the ball to a wall, making it an indirect game, while the other games in this family are generally direct games where the players face each other in two separate fields separated by a net or line on the ground. The Basques began playing pelota indirectly during the middle of the 19th century. For the different variations of Basque pelota, see the main article on Basque pelota. While most of the best world players are Basque (in either the Spanish or the French federations), it is by no means limited to the Basque Country and is also played in Castile, Rioja and places where Basques have emigrated to such as Mexico (home of frontenis), Florida and the Philippines. As such it has been an Olympic exhibition sport in Paris, Mexico and Barcelona. It is called pelota vasca in Spanish and pelote basque in French. Pulsolariak (arm wrestling) Basque arm wrestling follows broadly the same rules as anywhere else. Recortes A form of bull-leaping called errekorteak in Basque and recortes in Spanish, is practiced in parts of the Basque Country, especially Navarre. Soka-muturra (bull-herding) A calf with covered horn tips runs among youths in the Pamplona bull ring. The name of this sport literally translates as \\"snout rope\\" (soka \\"rope\\" and mutur \\"snout\\"). It is vaquillas (\\"calves\\") in Spanish. It derives from a tradition where cattle destined for slaughter were led through the town on long ropes regularly on a particular day of the week (which varies from town to town). Occasionally a bull would break free on run wild, an event called karrera egitea (to make a run), while the crowds made sport of the bulls. From the 14th century onwards bulls were increasingly let loose on purpose, ultimately leading to the tradition of running the bulls. It's also known as soka-mutilen jokoa, the game of the rope boys. Sometimes this would happen at night, with lights attached to the bulls, the most likely forerunner of the zezen-suzko or \\"fire bull\\".Mugika, G. Tradiciones y Costumbres, Congreso de Estudios Vascos 1919 In the zezen-suzko, a contraption of fireworks is strapped to a bull and lit at night. Today this is sometimes also practised in bullrings, either temporary or permanent, using calves rather. If fully grown bulls are used it is as a prelude for a bullfight, which is a regular feature of the Running of the Bulls in Iru√±ea/Pamplona. Toka Basques playing toka in Alegia This is game involves throwing small objects like pebbles, balls or coins across a distance, trying to hit the target, a vertical metal pole. It is called juego de la raya in Spanish and jeu de la raie in French. Txakur probak (sheepdog trials) Sheepdog trials are another lively example of the Basque traditional pastoral lifestyle. They're also called artzain txakurren trebetasun lehiaketak or \\"shepherd dogs skill competitions\\". Sheepdog trials in the Basque Country are very similar to those held in other countries and involves a sheepdog having to herd a flock of ewes into a fold. Traditionally the euskal artzain txakurra or Basque shepherd dog is kept but border collies are also increasingly popular. Identifying the best dogs for breeding is an important part to these competitions. A major Basque sheepog trial event is held in O√±ati in September. In Spanish this is called concursos de perro pastor and in French concours de chien de berger.

On May 20, 1778, a British force attempted to encircle a smaller Continental force under the Marquis de Lafayette. The maneuver failed, with the Continentals escaping the trap, but the British took the field. Prelude Contemplating the contingency of an early withdrawal by the British from occupied Philadelphia, General George Washington sent Lafayette to Barren Hill (about halfway between Valley Forge and Philadelphia) to reconnoiter British intentions, as well as to interdict British detachments foraging for food in the surrounding countryside.http://www.xenophongroup.com/mcjoynt/BarrenHill.htm On May 18, Lafayette left the Valley Forge camp with 2,100 troops and five pieces of artillery. After crossing the Schuylkill River and turning south, he took up position at Barren Hill, which was close to Matson's Ford. A brigade and the guns were posted on the high ground, near a church, facing south. Another posting was at the Ridge Road to the south, and the Pennsylvania militia was sent to guard the road that led west from White Marsh. The British quickly discovered that the American force was nearby and decided to attack. On May 19, 1778, around 10:30 p.m., Maj. Gen. James Grant and a 5,000-man British force, including 15 guns, was sent toward Barren Hill. The plan was to take a circuitous route leading to the junction of White Marsh Road and Ridge Road. This would cut off any avenue of retreat for the Americans. A body of 2,000 grenadiers and dragoons would then move along Lafayette's left flank while another group would move into position on the American right. The plan would result in the American position being encircled from 3 positions, trapping them against the river. The British force was to wait until morning to attack and destroy or capture the entire American force.  Battle  Map of the battle of Barren Hill On May 20, 1778, the British launched their attack. The militia scattered at the sight of the British troops, not offering any resistance and failing to notify Lafayette of the attack. On Ridge Road, the American group learned of the British attack. A small group was sent to fight a delaying action against the British while their commander sent word to Lafayette about the developments. After Lafayette learned of the attack, another patriot came up and told him that the British had advanced up the White Marsh Road. Lafayette knew of another small road that led back to Dickison Ford that would bypass the British force. It ran along some low ground that would conceal the Americans from the British. The British did not know about this road. Lafayette ordered his men to retreat down this road while ordering a rear guard to delay the British at the church. A few small patrols were sent to engage the British, skirmishing including the Oneida,http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/history/28612644.html making them think that the American force intended to stay and fight. Lafayette calmed his retreating force and slipped away with relatively few casualties.  Aftermath  The British, having failed to bag Lafayette, resumed their retreat from Philadelphia to New York. Washington's army shadowed Clinton on his withdrawal and forced a Battle at Monmouth on June 28, 1778, the last major battle in the North.

It is a cultivated ornamental vine. The species is native to Mexico. Etymology Hamatus (Latin) means \\"hooked\\", and refers to the curiously hooked stems. History Scheidweiler thought that this species originally came from Mexico, which is probably correct. Still, no evidently wild plant has been found. Although it is a quite common species, not much is known about its history. Origin and habitat The plant's origin in south and east Mexico. It is only known in cultivation. Systematics S. hamatus is a distinct species, distantly related to the grandiflorus-complex. Selenicereus radicans (DC.) A. Berger seems to belong here, but it is impossible to know for sure as the original description is brief and no type seems to exist. The publication of Cereus radicans predates C. hamatus. Cultivation This is an easily cultivated, fast growing plant. It needs a compost containing plenty of humus and sufficient moisture in summer. Should not be kept under 10 ¬∞C (50 ¬∞F) in winter. It can be grown in semi-shade or in full sun. Extra light in the early spring will stimulate budding. Only mature plants produce flowers. It makes an excellent pendent plant. Description Stems scandent, clambering or sprawling, branching, producing few aerial roots, very vigorous, to 5‚Äì12 m long or more, often growing 2 m or more in a season, 16‚Äì22 mm thick; ribs 4 or rarely 3-5, strong, later terete, acute; areoles small, brownish or black, remote, on the upper edges of knubby projections, these often forming obtuse, deflexed spurs about 1 cm long, internodes 4‚Äì5 cm; spines 5-6, ca 5 mm long, whitish, bristle like, 1-3 lower or central spines usually brown or black; epidermis glossy grass or light green.

The current name is usually presumed to be a contraction of AberelliotStatistical Account of Scotland, edited by Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster, Edinburgh 1791-99 or Aber-Eliot The Annals of a Border Club (The Jedforest) and Biographical Notices of the Families Connected Therewith, George Tranced of Weens, T S Smail, Jedburgh 1899\\\\- both meaning the mouth of the Elliot. It is situated west of Arbroath. The main village settlement is on the Elliot Water, 2.5 miles from Arbroath. There is a Church of Scotland church and a primary school. The school lies 1 mile further west in the approximate geographic centre of the parish. Falls at Arbirlot  Geology and Landscape  Arbirlot village, sometimes known as Kirkton of Arbirlot, lies in the Kelly Den, formed by the Elliot Water. The principal underlying rock formation is Old Red Sandstone and Arbirlot attracted the attention of early geologists because of the exposed rock formations in the Kelly Den. Hugh Miller describes the rock formations in the \\"pastoral village of Arbirlot\\" in detail in his highly influential 1841 book Old Red Standstone.Old Red Sandstone, Hugh Miller, Fairly Lyall & Co, Edinburgh 1841 A nature trail by the Elliot Water links Arbirlot with the former railway junction of Elliot on the Angus Coast. Arbirlot holds host to a spectacular 23 foot waterfall.  History   Prehistoric and Early Christian  There is extensive evidence of prehistoric occupation of the Arbirlot area. The First Statistical Account refers to the recent demolition of a \\"druidical temple\\" in the parish, the finding of a \\"Pictish crown\\", and the presence of numerous stone cairns. Historic Environment Scotland's Canmore database interprets the reference to the \\"druidical temple\\" as possibly referring to a stone circle and based on place-name evidence gives a possible location near to Cairncortie in the north-west of the parish. The Second Statistical Account mentions the finding of many stone arrowheads in the parish.New Statistical Account of Scotland, General Assembly of the Church of Scotland , Edinburgh 1834-45 There is a cup and ring marked boulder near Craigend.A short cist burial, of a type normally associated with the early bronze age, was excavated near Greenford Farm in 1957, close to where an ancient fortified enclosure was reported in 1910. There are cropmark indications of a possible Roman marching camp to the west of Grahamston Cottages. The date of the foundation of Arbirlot Kirk, dedicated to St Ninian is unknown, although dates as early as the first decades of the 400s have been proposed. The current manse garden contains a standing stone (illustrated) with what are thought to be medieval carvings, although much earlier dates have also been suggested. The stone was retrieved from the foundations of the parish church during re-building works in 1831. Monastic records give some support to the tradition of a Culdee religious house or \\"college\\" in Arbirlot, that was suppressed sometime after the founding of Arbroath Abbey in the late 12th century. The Culdee title of Abbe of Arbirlot continued to appear in records for some years until about 1207 but apparently as an honorific rather than an actual position of authority over a religious community. The First Statistical Account of 1792 relates the demolition of the ruins of a long revered religious house and early Ordnance Survey maps show the location of the \\"college\\" by the Rottonrow Burn.  Medieval  Prior to the founding of Arbroath Abbey, the church of Arbirlot belonged to the diocese of St Andrews and the bishops held lands lying to the east of the Elliot Water. Bishop Roger de Beaumont granted the church to the new Abbey around the time of its foundation, but retained the lands in Arbirlot for the diocese. The parish suffered from the effects of the First War of Scottish Independence in the late 13th and early 14th centuries as evidenced by the relief granted to the vicar of Arbirlot in March 1323 who was then twenty years in arrears in paying the two merks due annually to the Abbot of Arbroath Abbey. The relief was granted on the grounds of \\"the poverty, sterility, and destruction of the parish and its inhabitants, occasioned by the late war\\". Kelly Castle (sometimes Kellie Castle or Auchterlony Castle),RCAHMS Canmore Database - see External Links which overlooks the Elliot Water, comprises a four-storey tower of the late 15th or early 16th Century, set within a 19th-century courtyard. It was a stronghold of the Mowbray family until forfeited to the Stewarts in the early 14th century and was restored from a semi-ruined state by the Earl of Dalhousie in the 19th century.  Post-Reformation  By the 17c, the barony of Kellie (or Kelly), which included the castle and much of the parish, was in the hands of the Irvines of Drum, who in 1629 committed themselves to annual grants of 8 bolls of meal to the schoolmaster of Arbirlot and a further 12 bolls to the poor of the parish. In 1679 Alexander Irvine, who had built up unsustainable debts during his support for the Royalist cause during the Civil Wars, sold the barony to George Maule, 2nd Earl of Panmure for ¬£11,000 sterling. In the 18th and 19th centuries Arbirlot was principally occupied by handloom weavers and farmers, Arbirlot once had a meal mill, a slaughterhouse, two schools, a post office, a savings bank, an inn, a parish library as well as a number of shops. During the Napoleonic wars, Arbirlot, and in particular the then ruined Kelly Castle, was a notorious haunt of smugglers conducting an elicit trade with France. In 1830 Thomas Guthrie, later to become a well known theologian, social reformer and a founder of the Ragged School movement was appointed to the charge of Arbirlot by the heritor the Hon William Maule. Guthrie severed as Minister of Arbirlot for eight years. As well as divinity, Guthrie had studied medicine at Edinburgh and in Paris which knowledge was to be called upon when the parish suffered an outbreak of cholera. Clan Elliot The parish is believed to be the original home of Clan Elliot, which was transplanted in the Scottish Borders to defend the newly crowned Robert the Bruce's Scotland from English invaders through an intricate network of peel towers. The Elliots joined the clans of Armstrong, Scott, Douglas, Kerr, Nixon, Hepburn and Maxwell in this effort.

It is mainly used on experimental aircraft, prototype aircraft and development aircraft - both military and civil, and can monitor various parameters from the temperatures of specific components to the speed of the engines. This may be displayed in the cockpit or cabin to allow the aircrew to monitor the aircraft in flight, and is usually recorded to allow the data to be analysed later. A small modular data acquisition unit FTI typically monitors between 10 and 120000 parameters - for example temperatures inside the cargo and pressure distribution along the wing. FTI sources could be temperature sensors, pressure probes, voltages, current transducers, potentiometers, strain gauges, aircraft data buses or cameras. These sensors may be digitalized and acquired by the data acquisition system. A cockpit audio recording may also be included. A telemetry transmitter may be added to the FTI to allow real-time monitoring of the tests from a ground-station. A core component of a data acquisition system are the data acquisition units (DAU). These are electronic boxes that interface to FTI sources and are typically designed to be rugged and reliable. The current trend is to make these units as small as possible and move them closer to the sensors. This leads to many challenges for the designers of a data acquisition chassis such as how to cope with inhospitable environments and maintain functionality with smaller designs. For the end user it means shorter wiring, better accuracy and easier installation and maintenance. So called commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) systems are commonly used to keep costs low and speed delivery. This approach, and indeed the use of FTI originally developed for aerospace applications well within the earth‚Äôs atmosphere, is also increasingly common for space launchers and vehicles.

Jes√∫s Blancornelas (November 14, 1936 ‚Äì November 23, 2006) was a Mexican journalist who co-founded the Tijuana-based Zeta magazine, known for its reporting on corruption and drug trafficking. His work encompassed an extensive research on how the drug industry influences local leaders and the police in the Mexican state of Baja California ‚Äì topics frequently avoided by the rest of the Mexican media. As an author of six books, Blancornelas was regarded by the press as a leading expert on organized crime and drug trafficking during his time. He was also the first man to publish a photograph of Ram√≥n Arellano F√©lix, the former drug lord of the Tijuana Cartel. In response to the photo publication, the cartel attempted to kill Blancornelas in 1997, but he managed to survive the attack and continued to report on the workings of Mexico's criminal underworld. For more than two decades, Blancornelas received several international press awards for his defiance of Mexico's old regime status quo, where bribe-taking and censorship by the government were commonplace in Mexico's media. After his death, the Los Angeles Times and the Committee to Protect Journalists described him as \\"the spiritual godfather of modern Mexican journalism.\\" Blancornelas is also regarded as a pioneer in the push for press freedom in Mexico. Early career A native of San Luis Potos√≠, Blancornelas began his career as a journalist for El Sol de San Luis in April 1955, working as a sportswriter. In 1960, he moved to Tijuana, Baja California, where he became active in reporting on corruption and the drug trade. He was promoted to news editor at the daily newspaper El Mexicano before moving to the daily La Voz de la Frontera, of which he became editor-in-chief. Unlike several other journalists during his time, Blancornelas was eager to write about drug trafficking and corruption, leading to his firing from three newspapers before deciding to create his own. In 1977, he founded a newspaper called ABC. The paper employed future Zeta co-founder H√©ctor F√©lix Miranda, then a columnist who wrote under \\"F√©lix el Gato\\" (\\"Felix the Cat\\") to criticize local politicians. These columns eventually angered Baja California's state government and Mexico's former President Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo to the point that the government ordered Blancornelas to fire Miranda and banned its distribution. When Blancornelas refused, a SWAT team was sent to take over the paper's offices on the pretext of settling a labor dispute. Blancornelas escaped to the United States, resettling in San Diego, California.  Zeta  In 1980, Blancornelas re- surfaced with a new weekly publication known as Zeta, which he co-founded with F√©lix. The magazine printed copies in the United States and then smuggled them across the border into Mexico. After some years, they reestablished themselves in Tijuana. Through the magazine, the pair continued their investigation into organized crime and corruption. The magazine ran a cover story in 1985 about local police guarding a marijuana-filled warehouse; the story was the first to report on the future leaders of the Tijuana Cartel, the Arellano F√©lix brothers. After Blancornelas discovered that plainclothes police officers had bought all 20,000 copies of the issue, Zeta republished the issue under the headline \\"Censored!\\" F√©lix was killed by multiple shotgun blasts in 1988; two guards from the Agua Caliente Racetrack were later convicted of the murder. For the next eighteen years, Blancornelas left F√©lix's name on the Zeta masthead, marked with a black cross. He also published a full-page ad in every issue under F√©lix's \\"byline\\", asking the employer of the men, Tijuana politician Jorge Hank Rhon, why F√©lix had been murdered. In 1994, Zeta published an investigation on the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio; despite the conspiracy theories about the case, the magazine concluded that the shooting had been the work of a single troubled individual. In the 2000s, Blancornelas wanted to remove bylines from Zetas most dangerous stories, but was persuaded not to by reporter Francisco Ortiz, who wished his to continue to run atop his stories on organized crime. In 2005, Ortiz was shot to death in front of his children, and Blancornelas began his no-byline policy. In the days after Ortiz's death, he stated, \\"I feel remorse for having created Zeta. After losing three colleagues, I believe the price has been too high. I would have liked to retire a long time ago ... [but] I cannot allow drug traffickers to think that they were able to crush Zeta's spirit, and our readers to believe that we are afraid.\\" Blancornelas covered the rise of Mexico's drug trafficking organizations for more than thirty years, but his best work in the field took place during the 1990s. During this period, Mexico experienced the rise of three powerful drug cartels: the Tijuana Cartel in the west; the Ju√°rez Cartel in Ciudad Ju√°rez; and the Gulf Cartel in the east. Blancornelas' stories are considered so crucial that almost every written account of the Tijuana Cartel cites him. Assassination attempt In November 1996, Blancornelas was planning to visit New York City to receive an international award for his work in covering the drug trade, political corruption, and the relationship between the drug lords and the police. A few days before he was about to fly, a policeman in Tijuana visited Blancornelas and warned him that he was risking his life if he decided to go. A year later, the warning proved to be true: in 1997 in Tijuana, Blancornelas was ambushed and wounded by gunmen of the Tijuana Cartel while heading to the airport for publishing a photo of the drug lord Ram√≥n Arellano F√©lix. Blancornelas was nearly killed when the attackers opened fire on his car, wounding him in the abdomen and killing his driver and bodyguard, Luis Valero Elizalde, who died protecting him and managed to kill one of the shooters. Blancornelas suffered complications from the injury for the rest of his life. In the attack, Blancornelas' car was hit more than 180 times, but only four bullets penetrated the journalist's body. Elizalde, however, was hit 38 times. That same year, three other prominent journalists were killed in Mexico. The nature of Blancornelas' work forced him to live under a \\"self-imposed home arrest,\\" only traveling to his workplace and home with multiple Special Forces bodyguards from the Mexican Army, who accompanied him everywhere. While previous attacks on journalists received little coverage, Blancornelas' assassination attempt made it to the frontpage of most newspapers in Mexico, and was covered on the television and radio. The attempt also fueled interest internationally; the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, San Diego Union Tribune, and the National Public Radio covered it extensively. Due to the public outcry, the Mexican authorities decided to report the attack to the Office of the General Prosecutor, which had greater resources than the state authorities. After spending 20 days in the hospital, Blancornelas recovered from his wounds and returned to publishing for the Zeta magazine. He left the hospital with a walker and was escorted by municipal, judicial state, and federal policemen, along with soldiers of the Mexican Army, to his home in La Mesa delegation in Tijuana. As he got to his home, a crowd of reports awaited Blancornelas, who allowed them to take pictures of him but refused to answer any questions. \\"I'll be back as soon as possible,\\" Blancornelas said to the reporters as he entered his home. He also thanked the media for covering his assassination attempt. The Blancornelas family erected a huge brick wall in their one-story house to increase their security measures; outside the house, a squadron of military men guarded the family, while some others protected the Zeta offices. As of 1998, the top editors of the newspaper, along with Blancornelas' three sons, were under guard by the authorities at all times. Marco Arturo Qui√±ones S√°nchez, whom Mexican authorities alleged to be a hit man for the Tijuana Cartel, was later charged with being one of the gunmen in the attack on Blancornelas, but was found not guilty by a judge in 2013. Death In the last years of his life, Blancornelas lived as a virtual prisoner, always accompanied by an escort of fifteen armed guards. He died in the border city of Tijuana, Baja California on November 23, 2006 in Del Prado Hospital, from complications caused by stomach cancer, possibly caused by the embedded bullets he received when he was shot. Blancornelas was taken to the hospital on November 19 after his son confessed that his father had a lung defect that dated back to his youth. Prior to his death, Blancornelas stopped reporting directly for the Zeta magazine since February 2006 but still sent information to the magazine, particularly on issues covering drug trafficking. Beginning to doubt Zeta's ability to foster change, Blancornelas considered closing the magazine with his death. Editor Adela Navarro Bello and his son C√©sar Ren√© Blanco Villal√≥n persuaded him to let the magazine continue, however, and succeeded him as the magazine's co-publishers. Just before his death, Blancornelas speculated that the Tijuana Cartel had placed a US$250,000 bounty on his assassination, and publicly said that he wanted to interview Enedina Arellano F√©lix, a female drug lord of the cartel, to confirm the information. He was survived by his wife, Genoveva Villal√≥n de Blanco, and three sons: Jos√© Jes√∫s, Ram√≥n Tom√°s and C√©sar Ren√©. While Blancornelas' reporting helped bring some drug lords to justice, the Mexican drug trafficking organizations grew more powerful after his death. As he said in an interview shortly before dying:  Awards  In 1996, he was one of four winners of the US-based CPJ International Press Freedom Awards, which honor journalists who show courage in defending press freedom despite facing attacks, threats, or imprisonment. He also won the Maria Moors Cabot Prize of Columbia University and was honored as the International Editor of the Year by the World Press Review in 1998. Blancornelas was also UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize in 1999. In 2000 he was named one of the Austria- based International Press Institute's fifty World Press Freedom Heroes of the previous fifty years.

Blood's aim is to create music that expresses the meaning of human emotion that breaks the musical frame. They are closely associated with visual kei,Anime News Network but the band refers to themselves as a \\"gothic band\\". They have toured in Japan, Europe, the United States, Mexico and Australia. They're one of the first Japanese visual kei bands to tour in Australia. Blood was regularly featured in the Gothic & Lolita Bible and they have been featured in western magazines, including Astan, Rumore, and Gothic Beauty. History Blood was formed in February 2002 in Osaka, and has separate \\"periods\\" defined by changing concepts. The band was formed when members Kiwamu and Kaede recruited Dai and Taichi to their duo project. During the first period they released three singles, \\"Bloodtype\\", \\"Morphine/Collector\\", and \\"Tsuioku: I Remember You\\". On February 10, 2003, the vocalist Dai left. Blood began their second period with new vocalist Takeshi and released the mini-album \\"Blood\\". Blood performed twice in the USA at Fanime in 2003Fanime 2003 Program Guide and Anime Expo during the same year. They also released their third and fourth demo tapes. On February 29, 2004, Taichi and Takeshi left the band. Blood performed again at Fanime in May Fanime 2004 Program Guide with their new vocalist Fu-ki. This was his first time performing with the band in America. With new vocalist Fu-ki's entry into the band, Blood began to move their music in a more hard rock direction. The third period had a vampire concept.Cure magazine, Vol 29, June 2005, pg 90-91, release date April 21, 2005 Their next series of albums would follow a vampire story much in the vein of Anne Rice's novels, with the story penned entirely by Fu-ki and music writing handled solely by Kiwamu. In the winter of 2004, they released \\"Vengeance for Blood\\" and began their worldwide tour, starting in Europe. Soon after, Blood was interviewed on the radio show Bad Transitions on 91.7 WIXQ FM, a college radio station based in Millersville, Pennsylvania. The show was also broadcast by internet webcast. During a tour in May 2005, played three shows in Mexico City. That summer (July 2005), they released \\"Vengeance for Blood 2\\" and another European and Mexican tour followed. During the Mexican tour, they filmed their first full- length live DVD \\"Vengeance for Blood - Live in Mexico\\". Early in 2006, they released the final chapter in their vampire concept, \\"Vengeance for Blood 3\\". 2,000 copies were pressed, and it sold out in 4 days. In November 2006, they did another interview on WIXQ FM, this time on the newly formed Tainted Reality, hosted by former Bad Transitions host Roger Shackelford.Tainted Reality The following month (March 2006), they did their last tour with the vampire concept though Europe and a special live event in Japan. Shortly after, they announced a US and Mexico tour (Les Fleurs Du Mal). The USA tour sold out at both stops in Los Angeles and New York City. With the vampire concept finished, Blood was faced with a new beginning. They continued in the hard rock direction and started a new concept based on the poetry of French poet, Charles Baudelaire. They released their first mini-album under the French poetry concept entitled \\"Spleen ~Despair~\\" on October 7, 2006. Another tour of Europe followed, as well as an announcement of a US mini-tour for March 2007. \\"Les Fleurs du Mal\\" was released on July 7, 2007 in both Regular and Limited Edition, The Limited including the Darkest Labyrinth Vol.1 tour documentary. In this period, Kiwamu opened Cure distribution (Now known as Darkest Labyrinth) which aims to distribute foreign CD's in Japan, with GPKISM, Spectrum-x, Virgins O.R Pigeons and Noir du'Soleil being some of the artists currently signed. Almost a month after the release of \\"Les Fleurs du Mal\\" Blood released \\"Best Collection 2002-2007\\", composed of 4 songs from the first 2 eras of the band and the 12 from the present period. Afterward, the band worked on \\"Symphony of Chaos\\", which had a gothic industrial sound. EP \\"Dead-Hearted\\" was released September 9, 2007 and is the first of their works in the Symphony of Chaos concept, the track 'Blood' being a cover of a previous era and also includes Exo-Chika of Aural Vampire as a guest vocalist. Their single \\"Chain\\" was then released in December 2007 and \\"Vengeance for Blood\\" re-released. In early 2008 the band activities were relatively silent. Breaking the silence, the band released \\"The Reaper Behind Me\\", the first full-length album from the new concept. The CD contained two discs in which the second contained 10 remixes of songs from and prior to the album. Following the album's release the band toured Australia with GPKISM and Aural Window. In September 2007, Kiwamu joined GPKISM headed by GPK (Gothique Prince Ken) of Australia as the guitarist. The band recruited Ryonai (Blam Honey) on live keyboards and have released 1 album and 1 single, gaining them some notoriety. It was announced on November 20, 2008 through their official MySpace page that Blood will cease activities after their 2009 album Lost Sky and their final tour, entitled \\"La Fin de la Journee\\". Kaede and Ryo did not participate in the final tour. Gothique Prince Ken (better known as GPK) filled in on keyboard. Blood officially returned in 2011 with new members Hayato (vocalist), Kazuha (guitar), Dora (drums), and Azami (bass, of Misaruka), releasing the singles \\"Bathory\\" in June and Elizabeth in October. The band performed a North American tour in November, stopping at Dotcon in Toronto, Boston, NYC, Pennsylvania, and at Anime USA with the main act Matenrou Opera. 8 June 2012 Hayato left the band. In an interview he stated he could not disclose the reason.

The team won the 1992 Louis Vuitton Cup but failed to win the 28th America's Cup. Early years International America‚Äôs Cup Class boats (IACC) were a completely new design in 1992, replacing the 12 Meter boats that had competed for the America's Cup from 1958 to 1987. Gardini brought together an international group of designers, managers and sailors in his attempt to win the America's Cup. The primary designer was Argentine architect German Frers assisted by American Robert Hopkins. The yard director was Portuguese Fernando Sena, the operations manager was Frenchman Laurent Esquier and the skipper was French-American Paul Cayard. Design work began at the end of 1988 and construction of the first Il Moro started in 1990. Il Moro di Venezia I (ITA-1) was the very first hull built for the new generation (IACC) rule, and was launched on 11 March 1990 in Venice. Il Moro di Venezia II (ITA-7) was launched on 7 August 1990 in Palma de Mallora, followed by Il Moro di Venezia III (ITA-15) launched on 15 April 1991 in San Diego, Il Moro di Venezia IV (ITA-16) launched on 15 June 1991 in San Diego and finally, Il Moro di Venezia V (ITA-25) launched on 16 December 1991 in San Diego. The boats ITA-1 Il Moro di Venezia I in North Vancouver, 2013 Il Moro di Venezia I (ITA-1) sailed as a trial boat for two years and competed in the 1991 IACC World Championships, later becoming the sponsor platform for the syndicate. In 1994 she was bought by a Russian team that raced her in the 1994 IACC World Championships but never made it to the 1995 Louis Vuitton Cup competition. Repossessed by a bank, she was bought in 1998 by a Chicago businessman who installed an engine and sailed her for a couple of years in San Diego before she once again fell victim to the bank. Tina Kleinjan and John Sweeney bought her in 2001, adding her to their fleet of IACC boats in San Francisco. They completely restored her with new paint and rigging and raced her against other IACC boats in San Francisco bay. She was sold for the last time in 2006 and is currently moored in North Vancouver. ITA-7 Il Moro di Venezia II (ITA-7) Launched the 7 of August 1990 she was used as a trial boat prior to the Louis Vuitton Cup. She was later restored by Claudio Carraro and now is moored in Venice attending to a lot of sailing events.http://www.bachyachting.nl/yachts/html/yacht_12_meters_class_americas_cup_moro_di_venezia_aid-919.htm ITA-15 Il Moro di Venezia III (ITA‚Äì15) won the 1991 IACC World Championship, and was used as a trial boat prior to the Louis Vuitton Cup. Later, she sailed for the Sail Academy in Genoa, Italy, was purchased by another Italian team, +39, in July 2004, and finally acquired by America's Cup Management to be used as a VIP/PR boat in Valencia, Spain. Today the owner is Autorit√† portuale di Ravenna and she is placed on land close to their offices. ITA-16 Il Moro di Venezia IV (ITA‚Äì16) was used as a trial boat, but did not race in the Louis Vuitton Cup. Purchased by an American team, PACT 95, she was renamed Spirit of Unum and re-designated USA‚Äì16. She raced in the 1994 IACC World Championships and was used as a trial boat for PACT 95's 1995 America's Cup effort until she was T-boned by Ville de Paris, a practice boat for the Defi 95 French Challenge, leaving a hole just above the water line. She was retired that day, but later repaired and sailed in the UK under the name Right Time to help promote interest in the America's Cup races. In 2006 she was sold to Tom Cahalane of Team Il Moro by international yacht brokers Nicolle Associates and shipped to Ventura, California, but was never completely reassembled. In October 2009, she was acquired by Stephen Pattison & Mark Niblack, of Carbon Performance Sailing, LLC (dba: SAIL USA-11.) She has returned to her launch site in San Diego where she is undergoing restoration and will join USA-11. ITA‚Äì25 Il Moro di Venezia V (ITA‚Äì25), was selected on 24 January 1992 to compete in the Louis Vuitton Cup. In the race to the finals, Il Moro di Venezia V won 21 of 30 races, but came into the finals second behind NZL‚Äì20. After five races, Il Moro di Venezia V was down by 4 to 1 (though the last win by New Zealand was protested and annulled, making it 3 to 1.) But Il Moro di Venezia V came back with four straight wins to take the Louis Vuitton Cup and the right to challenge Bill Koch of America¬≥ for the 1992 America's Cup. In May 1992, she lost the best of seven series against America¬≥, USA‚Äì23, 1 to 4, though the margins were very close, ranging from 3 seconds to one minute, 58 seconds. In 1997 she was bought by AmericaOne to be used as a trial boat. In 2001 she was bought by the OneWorld. Finally, she was acquired by Bill Koch who completely restored her. She raced once more against USA‚Äì23 in the America's Cup Jubilee Regatta at Cowes, U.K. In 2005 she joined USA‚Äì23 for the final time, on display in front of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (MFA.) 1992 Challenge Il Moro di Venezia V won the 1992 Louis Vuitton Cup however, despite being favourites, they were unable to win the 1992 America's Cup. 1995 Challenge The team was preparing to participate in the 1995 Louis Vuitton Cup but the bid collapsed after the death of the syndicate director Raul Gardini.

Serving in addition to the two international commercial airports serving Chicago (O'Hare and Midway), the site would serve the south suburbs of the Chicago metropolitan area. The two existing airports currently serving Chicago (O'Hare and Midway) are located within and operated by the City of Chicago, with the Northern Illinois region also served by two other international airports in Illinois and Wisconsin. Following the expansion of O'Hare to become one of the busiest international airports of the world, proposals for a third airport have been in discussion since the end of the 1960s, with planning for the development of a site in Peotone since in the late 1990s. Since its initiation over 50 years ago, proposal for a third airport has remained controversial in terms of both cost, need, and calls for alternatives for accommodate increased air traffic demand. History of the proposed airport Stanley Berge, a professor at Northwestern University, first proposed a Peotone airport site on November 13, 1968. His main arguments for the proposed site were that it could have fast access to Chicago by rail and highway, that the potential site was far enough from O'Hare Airport to avoid the airports interfering with each other's flight patterns, that it would have all-weather flight safety, and that the site was environmentally compatible with the surrounding area. Berge envisioned a high- speed train service to downtown Chicago. The Peotone site was an alternative location to a proposed lake site announced during Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley's 1967 inaugural speech. The Chicago Public Works and Aviation Department worked cohesively with the Federal Aviation Administration during the Johnson and Nixon administrations from January 1967 to January 1970 to develop a litany of needed consultant reports beginning with an appraisal report, a summary of engineering reports, and graphic simulation studies for both a land and lake site. On January 27, 1970, Daley shelved plans for the airport, stating, \\"It was not necessary until year 2000\\". Following 15 years of investments at both O'Hare and Midway airports in the early 1970s, some northwest suburban leaders became concerned over noise issues at O'Hare Airport, the busiest airport in the world at that time, and an economic boon for Chicagoland. Leaders from suburban DuPage County and suburban northwest Cook County attempted to apply political pressure to control expansion and enhancements of O'Hare - the airport, however, received numerous expansions and upgrades over the next three decades. State House and Senate legislators tried three times to pass a Metropolitan Airport Authority bill from 1985 to 1987, in an effort to alleviate airspace noise and pollution from the airport but the bill never passed. Legislators compromised on a resolution, which awarded $500,000 for a transportation study for a proposed third Chicago area airport. In 1986, state legislation created the Illinois Airport System Plan Policy Commission (IASPPC). The commission had bipartisan and tri-state support from the governors of Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin. Commissioners chose consultant Peat Marwick to develop the aviation studies. The first capacity study concluded that O‚ÄôHare and Midway airports alone could not accommodate the expanding Chicago aviation market, and the study recommended another airport be built. Senator Aldo DeAngelis of south suburban Olympia Fields advocated for the Peotone site stating, \\"economic considerations would override political ones in choosing a location\\" for the airport. The City of Chicago had acquired three seats on the IASPPC, bringing the total to eleven. Political pressure by the City of Chicago resulted in IASPPC members voting to eliminate all rural sites from the final vote. The final vote selection was between Gary Airport and Lake Calumet, a lake and region in Chicago that the airport would be built in proximity to, and also the mayor's preference. The Lake Calumet site was selected and Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley, the son of a previous Chicago mayor, Richard J. Daley, attempted to put a legislative bill through during the end of the state legislative session. The cost of the Lake Calumet site was $10.8 billion. State Senate President Pate Phillips did not support the bill as it would cost the state $2 billion for its share. It took four tries in the State House before reaching the State Senate. By July 1992, Mayor Daley declared the airport issue dead and focused on further expansions and enhancements of O'Hare and Midway airports. Planning for the South Suburban Airport began in 1984 as a cooperative venture between the states of Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, the city of Chicago, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which has stated that the Chicago area needs a third airport to handle growing air traffic. After many studies, the airport location alternatives were narrowed to five sites in 1990. The state of Illinois submitted an Environmental Assessment to the FAA in March 1998 for approval of the development of an airport at a site in eastern Will County. Recently, the FAA prepared a Tier 1 Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for site approval and land acquisition. The FAA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) on the Tier 1 EIS in July 2002, which approved the Will County, Illinois, site as a technically and environmentally feasible location for the development of a potential future air carrier airport in the south suburban area of Chicago. The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) began purchasing land for the Will County airport site in 2002, with funding of $75 million earmarked by the Illinois FIRST program. The state has purchased about half of the required for the plan. The current plan is in flux as the position of the runways are continuing to be debated. Eminent domain cases are also working their way through the courts. About three million people live in central and south Cook County, Illinois; Will County, Illinois; and Lake County, Indiana, putting them in reasonable proximity to the proposed airport in Peotone. The airport is also expected to have travelers from all over Chicagoland. In June 2008, Gary-Chicago International Airport in Gary, Indiana announced an agreement with three local railroads (Norfolk Southern, EJ&E;, and CSX) that will allow the relocation of railroad tracks so that the airport runways may be expanded. These longer runways will allow the airport to handle larger aircraft. In March 2011, then-Illinois Governor Pat Quinn announced his intention to start construction \\"as fast as humanly possible\\" on an airport in Illinois; however, the FAA had not finalized plans yet and the land acquisition was still being completed.Battle Over Peotone Airport Still Going , Michael Borunda, ChicagoTalks, March 7, 2011 In June, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood noted that there had been little call at the federal level recently for the proposed Peotone airport. However, plans for the south suburban airport were still in progress.DuPage Airport lands praise, but third-airport proposal still circling, Susan Frick Carlman, The Courier-News, June 14, 2011 The proposed airport is within the airspace of an existing airport, Bult Field (C56), a privately owned airport with a 5,000-foot runway. On July 1, 2014, IDOT purchased Bult Field and some surrounding land for $34 million for the new Chicago-area airport.IDOT Acquires Bult Field, Major Milestone for South Suburban Airport , Illinois Department of Transportation Press Release, July 1, 2014 The proposed third airport was included in REBUILD Illinois, the 2019 capital bill signed into law by Governor J. B. Pritzker. The bill allocated $162 million allocated toward road improvements that would connect Interstate 57 to the proposed airport site, an environmental review, and the completion of a master plan. Support An op-ed in Crain's Chicago Business by public affairs consultant Delmarie Cobb cites its proximity to five of Amazon's south suburban fulfillment centers and job opportunities for residents of the South Side of Chicago and south suburbs as reasons to support a third airport in the south suburbs. Supporters of a new south suburban airport have historically found common ground with those opposing an expansion of O'Hare Airport, which is routinely ranked as the world's first or second busiest airport. The proponents of the south suburban airport and those opposing expansion of O'Hare believe a south suburban airport would alleviated the heavy and still growing air traffic in Chicagoland, while not necessitating the expansion of the already extremely large and busy O'Hare. It would also provide additional economic opportunities to the south suburbs. There had been discussions on expanding the airports in either Rockford, Illinois or Milwaukee, Wisconsin and utilizing one of those airports as a third Chicago area airport. However, proponents of a third airport believe that Rockford and Milwaukee are not close enough to Chicago to be an effective option, and that expanding Milwaukee's or Gary, Indiana's airports for Chicago-bound travelers is not as financially beneficial to the state of Illinois as it will be to the states of Wisconsin or Indiana. Opposition There is no official name beyond the south suburban airport, and two separate plans exist. The FAA refers to both proposals as South Suburban Airport. The airport would serve as an additional airport in the Chicago metropolitan area. Critics believe the airport is unnecessary and may be a failure like MidAmerica St. Louis Airport. These groups believe that expanding O'Hare or other existing airports in Rockford, IL; Milwaukee, WI; or Gary, IN are thought to be viable alternatives. The Peotone specific opposition to the south suburban airport includes environmentalists and farmers. Kevin Brubaker of the Environmental Law and Policy Center said the construction would destroy 1,200 acres of flood plains as well as 180 acres of wetlands. Alternative proposals Various politicians and interest groups have proposed alternatives to a south suburban airport. Lake Calumet site Four months after the election of Mayor Richard M. Daley in August 1989, the Lake Calumet site was submitted by Daley as an alternative site to the IASPPC. By February 5, 1990, Daley released a feasibility study for the Lake Calumet site which indicated that the $5 billion cost to construct the airport would be partially funded by a passenger facility charge which would generate $1.8 billion. Federal legislation sealed the passenger facility charges on August 2, 1990, in the 101st Congress's 2nd session through H.R. 5170. The proposed airport would have resulted in the demolition of Chicago‚Äôs Hegewisch neighborhood along with portions of suburban Burnham and Calumet City and faced staunch opposition from Hegewisch residents. After facing opposition from Senate President Pate Philip and concerns over the cost of the airport, Daley declared the airport proposal \\"dead.\\" O‚ÄôHare expansion After his failure to build the Lake Calumet airport, Daley focused his efforts on the expansion of O'Hare Airport. Opponents of the O'Hare expansion are supportive of a third airport. Expansion of other area airports A proposal to turn the Gary/Chicago International Airport into Chicago's third major airport received a boost in early 2006 with the approval of $48 million in federal funding over the next ten years. Expansion plans include a new multi-level Intermodal Terminal combining three modes of transit ‚Äì passenger rail, passenger vehicles and air travel. The rail system is designed to combine both commuter and high-speed lines.

About south of Brampton and east of Carlisle. The population of the civil parish taken at the 2001 census was 85, increasing to 131 at the 2011 Census. Village Cumrew consists of two townships one of which is Cumrew Inside and the other Cumrew outside. Together they contain 2,686 acres. The parish borders Croglin, Cumwhitton, Carlatton, and Castle Carrock. The village consists of 33 households 31 of which have permanent living residents. Business in Cumrew is very limited and consisted of farms and an company called Cleanroom Supplies Ltd. The local farms include Rising Sun, Helme and Gateshaw Mill. History In Hutchinson's time the outline of an extensive quadrangle was visible in a field near the church, suggesting that a large object had occupied the spot it may be seen that an outline of an extensive quadrangle used to exist, possibly the remains of Dunwalloght Castle. There is not much supporting evidence for this claim or assumption, as when two small mounds were removed in 1832 there was no trace of a foundation. The Dacres family formerly owned two small estates in the area, which they sold to Sir Christopher Musgrave and Dugdale, in his Baronage, suggesting that they had a castle on this site, near the borders. Beyond this allusion nothing is known, either of Dunwalloght's history or its site. On the summit of Cardunnock, whose British name has descended to us with considerable purity with ancient Keltic inhabitants. Near is a cairn of stones. An accumulation of these stones must have cost the expenditure of a vast amount of labour. Is where some British chief was laid to rest, with his war axe and flint headed spear beside him. \\"Great indeed must have been the importance of the mighty dead, for whom these sepulchres on the mountains' brow were reared ; and as when living they were held in honour, so they were set forth on their long journey to the unseen land of Annwyn ‚Äì the Celtic Paradise of the west ‚Äì it may be with a nation's tribute of reverence and love.\\" St Mary's Church St Mary's Church, Cumrew The Church is dedicated to St Mary, built in 1890 and designed by George Dale Oliver. The church is very small with a small tower to the west of the church which holds two bells. The church became a grade two listed building on 1 April 1957. Population Population changes in Cumrew from 1811 to 2001 The population of Cumrew has been decreasing for a number of years between been 1831 to 1891. The population slightly increased in 1901 then took another turn and decreased again between 1921 and 1951. There are two major factors that could have influenced this population decline. The first is that of World War I 1914 to 1918 where young men were called up that would have worked on the farm land around the parish. Britain had casualties totalling 2,535,424, so many of the men that were called up to fight for King and country did not return, leading to a population decrease in many English rural parishes. It was not long for people who had returned from the war were to be called up again in 1939 because of the start of World War II and like before many of the men did not return from the war thus left the rural populations of the parishes to decline once more. Britain sent more than 5 million men to fight in the war, consequently having a negative impact on the rural parishes. from Since 1961 the population of the village has stayed in an upward trend. Occupational structure of Cumrew in 1831 Males aged 20 and over in 9 occupational categories Information on the occupational structure of Cumrew is limited. The bar chart shows that many of the men living in the parish in 1831 were agricultural labourers working on farms, for example Rising Sun, Helme Farm and Cateshaw Mill, in and round Cumrew. The farms also supplied many of the boarding parishes with employment as 12 of the farmers employed agricultural labourers. Governance Carlatton and Cumrew is a joint parish council for Cumrew and neighbouring Carlatton; it forms part of the City of Carlisle non-metropolitan district. Cumrew is situated in the electoral ward of Wetheral on the City of Carlisle non-metropolitan district council. Which elects two councillors. Currently both seats are held by the conservatives, cllr Barry Ogilvie Earp and cllr Neville John Lishman. Cumrew is also situated in the Wetheral Division which elects one councillor to Cumbria County Council currently held by the conservatives, Nicholas Henry Marriner.

History In 1985, the Army split the generalized Electronic Warfare/Intercept Systems Technician 33S MOS into five specializations 33P (Strategic Receiving Subsystems Repairer), 33Q (Strategic Recording Subsystems Repairer), 33R (Aviation Systems Repairer), 33V (Aerial Sensor Repairer), 33T (Tactical Systems Repairer)]. However, on 1 October 1998 the Army recombined the 3 MOSs: 33R (Aviation Systems Repairer), 33T (Tactical Systems Repairer), 33Y (Electronic Warfare/Intercept Strategic Systems Repairer) into one MOS‚Äî33W (Electronic Warfare/Intelligence Systems Repairer). This change was prompted due to lack of need in several of the 33 series. By combining all three into one MOS, the Army was able to provide the same support with fewer soldiers and use OJT (on the job training). On 1 October 2007, the 33W designation was renamed to 35T to group all Military Intelligence MOSs in the same 35 series. Training 35Ts are trained to perform maintenance tasks associated with electronic warfare equipment and systems. The soldiers are taught about electricity and advanced electronic theory, advanced concept and troubleshooting theory to include basic and advanced computer concepts and advanced troubleshooting skills using the Army's most advanced EW systems. Also taught are the concepts of basic analog and digital electronics repair, communications theory (receivers, recorders, and multiplexing/de-multiplexing, transmission line repair techniques, computer architecture/operating systems fundamentals, automated messaging, and network operations/troubleshooting. Upon completion of training a 35T has all the skills to repair and maintain virtually any electronic system from the tactical to strategic level. As an expert a 35T may be tasked to repair/maintain Transmitters/Transceivers (AN/TLQ-17A, AN/TLQ-17, AN/TLQ-40, AN/TLQ-63); Imagery Analysis systems (AN/TSQ-179(TGS), signal intelligence systems (GR/CS) and (PROPHET), aerial electronic warfare systems (RC-12 Guardrail), or complex/advanced computer systems and networks.

He was credited variously as John W English, John English or Jack English. Career John English was born in Cumberland in the United Kingdom but moved to Canada at an early age. He first worked as a film editor before getting a break into directing at Republic in 1935. For a period in the 1930s and 1940s, starting with Zorro Rides Again (1937), he directed Movie Serials in partnership with William Witney. It was customary at the time for two directors to work on each serial, each working on alternate days. Witney customarily worked on the action scenes while English concentrated on character and story elements. Together they are regarded as having produced the best examples of the serial medium: > most notable of all were the directing talents of William Witney and John > English. Together they directed seventeen consecutive serials, honing an > approach that allowed Republic serials to far outdistance the competition. > They adopted a no-nonsense approach that treated the serial material with > respect and rarely gave any clues that we shouldn't consider the stories > seriously.

In the post war era whilst William Witney directed a series of Roy Rogers films for Republic, English directed a series of Gene Autry pictures for Columbia Pictures. In the 1952-1953 television season, English directed several episodes of Alan Hale, Jr.'s Biff Baker, U.S.A. espionage series on CBS.

The population at the 2011 Census was 1,662. The village is south of Wetherby. Many of the older buildings are built of magnesian limestone. Etymology The name Clifford is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086. It comes from the Old English words clif ('cliff, bank') and ford ('ford'), thus meaning 'ford at the bank or cliff'. This perhaps referred to the crossing of the River Wharfe at Boston Spa, which was then within the manor.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Name Society, 2017), p. 36. History According to the Domesday Book, in 1086, Ligulf held the manor, which comprised six carucates with four ploughs.Open Domesday Online: Clifford, retrieved 23 January 2020. In the Middle Ages Clifford was a subordinate settlement to Bramham, and had no parish church or manor house. A Wesleyan chapel was built some time before 1838, and the three churches soon after. The Anglican St Luke's Church was built in 1840.Clifford Conservation Area Management Plan Clifford was originally a farming community, but in 1831, corn mills powered by Bramham Beck on Old Mill Lane, were transformed into flax mills, making patent yarn and shoe thread. The mills were owned by the Grimston Brothers. At its height, the business employed about 300 workers, some of them Irish immigrants, and many of whom lived in the stone terraced cottages in the village. Governance Clifford was a township in the old parish of Bramham, in the upper-division of the wapentake of Barkston Ash, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It became a separate civil parish in 1866 as Clifton with Boston, which was split into the civil parishes of Clifford and Boston Spa in 1896.Vision of Britain website: Clifford With Boston Geography Clifford is a rural village, with a conservation area at its centre. It has a mix of buildings from traditional magnesian limestone cottages to modern family housing. All construction within the conservation area must use local limestone. Green Belt land separates the village from Bramham and Boston Spa. Limestone for building was quarried locally. The A1(M) motorway is just over to the west. Bus services coordinated by West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive go to Tadcaster, Leeds, Harrogate, Wetherby and Wakefield. Religion St Luke's C of E church There are three churches in Clifford. The Anglican church dedicated to St Luke on high ground at the western end of the village is built in the Gothic style of architecture and was consecrated by the Archbishop of York in 1842. The church cost ¬£1200 raised by subscription and the site was donated by George Lane-Fox. The Wesleyan Methodists built a chapel, and the Roman Catholics built St Edward King and Confessor Catholic Church to serve the population of Irish workers that came to work in Grimstons flax mill established in the village in 1831. The Grimston, Clifford and Vavasour families contributed to the cost of building the church. Economy The Bay Horse Clifford has two public houses The Albion and The Old Star) and a fish and chip shop (Clifford Fisheries). There were no other shops or businesses in 2009 as the post office had been converted into houses. Public houses The Old Star is a historic multi room pub owned and operated by Samuel Smith's Old Brewery. The Albion is situated on the edge of the village is run under lease from Enterprise Inns. The Bay Horse is the local 'games pub', its pool team plays in the Wetherby League. Education There are three schools in the Clifford parish, Bramham Primary School, St. John's School for the Deaf and Boston Spa School. Culture The Village Hall is a small venue for concerts and plays. Clifford's first Beer Festival took place in June 2010. Clifford's second Champion Beer Festival took place on 2 July 2011 and due to its popularity took place for a third and fourth time (2012, 2013) and has become an annual event. Clifford has a monthly magazine, The Outlook, that is delivered free to every resident by the committee.

In 1848 the government appointed him professor of Hebrew and Jewish history in the newly founded rabbinical school of Vilnius. Fuenn filled this position with great distinction till 1856, when he resigned. The government then appointed him superintendent of the Jewish public schools in the district of Vilnius, in which he introduced instruction in the secular sciences and modern languages. Fuenn also took an active part in the administration of the city and in its charitable institutions, and was for many years an alderman. In acknowledgment of his services the government awarded him two medals. Works Fuenn was a prolific writer, devoting his activity mainly to the fields of history and literature.

Though initially a spin-off of the Pierian Sodality, the association broke its ties with Harvard soon after its founding. The association's most important notable accomplishments include the creation of the country's finest music library of the time, the sponsorship of the first professional and public chamber music series in the United States, the erection of the Boston Music Hall, and the formation of the orchestra which ultimately gave rise to the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The association's library catalog may be searched on OCLC with the initials HVDMA.  History  Founding In July 1837, the Pierian Sodality, a society of musically inclined Harvard undergraduates, held its annual meeting. They proposed the organization of a new society, the chief object of which would be \\"... the promotion of musical taste and science in the University ... to enrich the walls of Harvard with a complete musical library ... and to prepare the way for regular musical instruction in the College.\\" By general agreement, and with the help of various past members, the organization now known as The Harvard Musical Association was created at a subsequent meeting on August 30, 1837 under the name \\"The General Association of Past and Present Members of the Pierian Sodality\\". The name was shortened in 1840. The new association, advocating the teaching of music at Harvard, sent the following series of resolutions to Josiah Quincy, Harvard's president at that time. Proposals from outsiders for the improvement of the university were considered presumptuous, and Quincy never acknowledged that he had received the document. It was not until 1862, when John Knowles Paine was appointed Harvard's first professor of music, that music became an established part of the curriculum. In light of the College's attitude and decreasing undergraduate participation, the membership agreed not to mention Harvard at its meetings (a ban that remained in effect for twenty- four years) and turned its capacities toward the advancement of music in Boston. Music in Boston The Boston Music Hall The program of the second chamber music concert at the HMA The association's first undertaking was the establishment of an annual lecture series, delivered on erudite musical topics by qualified individuals. The lecture series in itself lasted five years, with speakers Henry R. Cleveland (1840), John Sullivan Dwight (1841), William Whetmore Story (1842), Ezra Weston (1843), and Christopher P. Cranch (1845). Starting in 1842, chamber concerts accompanied the annual lectures. From 1844 to 1849, the association sponsored a series of chamber music concerts open to the public. Though this concert series lasted only five years, it had a profound impact on music in the United States, both by increasing public knowledge of chamber music, and by helping music in general gain legitimacy as an art form. In 1850, under the leadership of member Dr. Jabez Upham, the association raised in sixty days the sum of US$100,000 to build a new Music Hall between Tremont and Washington Streets. This hall, seating over two thousand, was dedicated by Jenny Lind in 1852. Ten years later the members of the association raised an additional $60,000 to install in the hall an organ built in Germany by Walcker. Regarded as the largest organ in the United States, this instrument contained 5,474 pipes and 84 registers and may now be heard (altered by √Üolian‚ÄìSkinner) in its own hall in Methuen. On December 28, 1865, the association began its sponsorship of public concerts by the Harvard Orchestra, conducted by Carl Zerrahn. Of these concerts, which took place in the Music Hall, King's Dictionary of Boston reported in 1883: \\"The greatest works of the greatest masters have been given at these concerts, the standard of whose programmes has been kept at the highest, with the view, in part, of educating the taste of the musical public in what is greatest and best without regard to fashion or popular demand.\\" The orchestra, however, had humble beginnings. Though composed of sixty-two players, the orchestra often lacked necessary instruments. As Arthur Foote said: \\"When a harp was needed in the orchestra ... , one of us would do the best we could to replace it by playing its part on an upright piano.\\" In 1882, after having suffered monetary losses for eight years, the Harvard Orchestra was dissolved and turned over the last of its funds, $1,000 to the association. Association member Henry Lee Higginson, however, sought to revivify orchestra music in Boston, and in 1881 placed an ad in the Boston newspapers, which would lead to the creation of the first professional symphony orchestra in Boston: Although Higginson had intended for members of Harvard Orchestra to play in the new one, most were not good enough musicians to reach the level of perfection required to fulfill Higginson's hopes for the professional orchestra. After the disbanding of the Harvard Orchestra in 1882, the association stopped all direct participation in the Boston music scene, and continued to host concerts for the pleasure of members only. Library The association's library, however, remained open to the public, and is still an integral part of the association's daily operations. With bequeaths from various members, it soon assembled many books and scores which were assessed by the Salem Register in 1843 as constituting the \\"largest and best musical library in the country.\\" Today, the library has over 11,000 volumes, including many rare and notable works. A few examples: *A collection of sheet music published by the Van Hagens, the first sheet music publishers in Boston *An archive of the complete running of Dwight's Musical Journal *Malcolm Alexander's A Treatise of Musick, Speculative, Practical, and Historical, the first history of music in the English language. *A signed first edition of C√©sar Franck's Pi√®ces [cinq] pour harmonium *A first edition of Mozart's Sei quartetti per due violin, viola, e violoncello Premiere of Parsifal In 1880, German composer Richard Wagner encountered difficulty in getting Parsifal performed in Bayreuth. Annoyed because of his large expenditures on the Festival Theater, the venue at which he had intended to hold the performance, and bureaucratic opposition, he said in a letter to American dentist Newell S. Jenkins: \\"It seems to me as if, in my hopes of regarding Germany and her future, my patience would very soon be exhausted.\\" In a display of his notorious ego, Wagner proposed that if an American organization would give him $1,000,000, he would agree to come to the United States, to live there permanently, and to put on the first performance of Parsifal. Jenkins forwarded the letter to Andrew D. White‚Äîthen the American ambassador to the German Empire‚Äîwho in turn sent it to John Sullivan Dwight. Although the association briefly considered the proposal, Wagner's difficulties in Bayreuth were resolved before any plans were finalized. Parsifal was produced in 1882, and Wagner died the following year. Locations \\"Social evenings\\" for members and guests were held first in Cambridge and then in such renowned Boston locations as the Revere House, the Tremont House, and the original Parker House. Then, the association would gather ten to twelve times a year to hear some of the leading chamber musicians of the day and to share a post-concert supper. Whether the white- tie-and-oyster affair of the 19th century or the baked bean, Welsh rarebit, and ale collation of the present, the social evening remains the heart of the organization. From its beginning and through the 1880s, the association's rooms were moved from time to time. From 1858 to 1869, its Library was placed in the Athen√¶um. In 1892, the association acquired the Malcolm Greenough (brother of Horatio Greenough) house at 1 West Cedar Street. Opened with a reception for Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k, this has remained the association's residence for over 100 years. The main floor was dropped four feet in 1907, which required relocating the main entrance to Chestnut Street and taking a new number, 57A. With a bequest from Julia Marsh, widow of Charles Marsh (member Eben Jordan's partner), the association renovated the upper floors in 1913. The third floor, with its warren of leased rooms, was gutted and the resulting space joined to the second floor to create space for a highly ornamented, double-height hall (designed by member architect Joseph Everett Chandler, a Colonial Revival specialist) thereafter known as the Marsh Room. The condition of Marsh's bequest was that the room in her honor be open during weekdays (provided there's no association gathering) to local musicians for practice. Famous members Henry Ware Jr., first president of the HMA Of the builders of the association, particular mention should be made of John Sullivan Dwight, a noted transcendentalist and member of the Brook Farm movement, who for many years published a recondite Journal of Music and was widely known as one of the nation's outstanding musicologists. It was largely through his efforts that the Library was established, the Music Hall was built, and the Harvard Orchestra was organized. He served as president of the association from 1873 until his death in 1893, at which time he was a resident in the new house of the association. Other significant figures in the association's affairs include Henry Ware Jr., first president; Henry White Pickering, president from 1852 to 1873; Arthur Foote, the celebrated composer, who importantly reorganized the library during his membership from 1875 to 1937; and Charles R. Nutter, historian of the association and an active member from 1893 to 1965. Courtenay Guild, an important figure during the first half of the 20th century, served as president of the association for twenty-five of the sixty years he was a member. At his death in 1946, a substantial portion of his estate was bequeathed to the association and added to its capital funds. Noted Harvard musicologist Hugo Leichtentritt had his autobiography published by the Harvard Musical Association. Following the retirement of Richard Wait, a Boston lawyer, as president of the association in 1979, and in light of his unprecedented thirty-one years in office, the concert hall on the first floor was named in his honor as the Richard Wait Room. Recent years HMA Orchestra Drawing its initial members from former players of instruments in the Pierian Sodality (now the Harvard‚ÄìRadcliffe Orchestra) and later from others who in adult life continued to practice their instruments, it is not surprising that members of the association should have participated in numerous orchestras and ensembles. Notable among these was the Harvard Alumni Orchestra which met under the direction of Jacques Hoffman in the 1920s, giving several public concerts. The current orchestra for members grew out of the efforts of John Codman in 1947. It was first directed by Malcolm Holmes, then also Director of the Pierian Sodality. Following his death in 1953, it has continued under the leadership of Chester Williams, a member of the association and former Dean of the New England Conservatory of Music. The current orchestra is substantially less active than some predecessors: its most recent public concert was in 1948. Philanthropy and awards Support of music by the association in recent years has taken different forms. In the late 1950s, it offered awards for the best original compositions of chamber music, for which over eighty compositions were submitted. The association has given scholarship aid to various schools of music and small grants to symphony, opera, chamber music, and ballet organizations. In 1985, the association initiated the annual High School Achievement Awards program to reward promising classical musicians in the greater Boston area of secondary school age. Terence Hsu, New England Preparatory School pianist, won the 2007‚Äì2008 Awards and performed a recital on March 28, 2008, at the association. The recital was attended by over 100 invited guests, and included the \\"Waldstein\\" Sonata by Ludwig van Beethoven as well as notable etudes by Alexander Scriabin, Moritz Moszkowski, and Sergei Rachmaninoff. Awarded a $2,000 cash prize, Terence Hsu, 16, in addition to being a prolific pianist, is also a violinist and composer. In 1990, it established the Arthur W. Foote Prize in honor of teacher, composer, and performer member Arthur W. Foote. The Foote Prize is given annually to a performer or group who is attending an East Coast university and who is on the way to a successful career. Entrants are considered by the Foote Prize Committee and the winner is awarded $5,000 and gives a concert at the association. Events and performances The Julia Marsh Room, December 2003 In 1987, the association celebrated its sesquicentennial. The association's most valued achievement that year was its commissioning of John Harbison's Second String Quartet. The association also co-sponsored the work's premiere performance by the Emerson String Quartet. A Sesquicentennial Dinner was held at the St. Botolph Club. New works continue to be commissioned from time to time, including in the last several years compositions by John Bavicchi, Arthur Berger, John Huggler, Thomas Oboe Lee, and Thomas McGah. In October 1992, the association marked the centennial of its arrival at 57A Chestnut Street by reproducing the opening of one hundred years earlier. The Wait Room was decorated with flowers, lobster shells, stuffed quail, and pomegranates. Champagne and Cotuit oysters were followed by the congregational singing of a Latin anthem written for the association. The house's inaugural concert was performed, consisting of Beethoven's Archduke Trio, Handel's \\"O, Ruddier than the Cherry\\", two songs by Bach, and Beethoven's \\"Adelaide\\". After these performances and hors d'≈ìuvres, ninety members of the association ascended to the Marsh Room where, over the next three hours, a seven-course candlelight feast was consumed. The seven accompanying wines came from the same regions, and in three instances the same vineyards, as those served in 1892. Dr. Richard W. Dwight (a member of the association since 1933) and Mrs. Helen Roelker Kessler (grand-niece of an early member of the association, Bernard Roelker, whose Fund of Convivial Impulses subsidized the Centennial gala), delivered speeches. Renovations Improvements to the association's rooms both for the comfort of members and guests as well as for the safety of the building and collections have been the major undertakings during the past nine years. Kilmer McCully, president from 1994 to 1997 began the program of improvements with the design and construction of new men's and ladies' rooms and a new commercial kitchen. During the presidency of Rina Spence (1997‚Äì2000) an elevator was installed to permit handicapped access to three out of five floors at 57A. Under Presidents Dr. John B. Little (2000‚Äì2003) and J. Stephen Friedlaender (2003‚Äì2006), the association provided its building with an automatic fire suppression system as well as an archival storage area. Through a member-led effort, the recording archive of the 300 concerts from 1951 to 1971 were transcoded from magnetic tape to CDs and the catalogue of recordings placed online. Current projects include making the HMA catalogue accessible online and evaluating the preservation needs of the collections.  References  *Broyles, Michael.

Myxomas are the most common primary cardiac tumor in adults, and are most commonly found within the left atrium. Myxomas may also develop in the other heart chambers. The tumor is derived from multipotent mesenchymal cells. Causes Myxomas are the most common type of adult primary heart tumor. Most myxomas arise sporadically (90%), and only about 10% are thought to arise due to inheritance. About 10% of myxomas are inherited, as in Carney syndrome. Such tumors are called familial myxomas. They tend to occur in more than one part of the heart at a time, and often cause symptoms at a younger age than other myxomas. Other abnormalities are observed in people with Carney syndrome include skin myxomas, pigmentation, endocrine hyperactivity, schwannomas and epithelioid blue nevi. Myxomas are more common in women than men. Signs and symptoms Symptoms may occur at any time, but most often they accompany a change of body position. Pedunculated myxomas can have a \\"wrecking ball effect\\", as they lead to stasis and may eventually embolize themselves. Symptoms may include: * Shortness of breath with activity * Platypnea ‚Äì Difficulty breathing in the upright position with relief in the supine position * Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea ‚Äì Breathing difficulty when asleep * Dizziness * Fainting * Palpitations ‚Äì Sensation of feeling your heart beat * Chest pain or tightness * Sudden Death (In which case the disease is an autopsy finding) The symptoms and signs of left atrial myxomas often mimic mitral stenosis. General symptoms may also be present, such as: * Cough * Pulmonary edema, as blood backs up into the pulmonary artery, after increased pressures in the left atrium and atrial dilation * Hemoptysis * Fever * Cachexia ‚Äì Involuntary weight loss * General discomfort (malaise) * Joint pain * Blue discoloration of the skin, especially the fingers change color upon pressure, cold, or stress (Raynaud's phenomenon) * Clubbing ‚Äì Curvature of nails accompanied with soft tissue enlargement of the fingers * Swelling ‚Äì any part of the body * Presystolic heart murmurEric J. Topol. The Topol Solution: Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine, Third Edition with DVD, Plus Integrated Content Website, Volume 355. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Oct 19, 2006; page 223. These general symptoms may also mimic those of infective endocarditis. Complications * Arrhythmias * Pulmonary edema * Peripheral emboli * Spread (metastasis) of the tumor * Blockage of the mitral heart valve * Stroke * Fusiform cerebral aneurysms Diagnosis A doctor will listen to the heart with stethoscope. A \\"tumor plop\\" (a sound related to movement of the tumor), abnormal heart sounds, or a murmur similar to the mid-diastolic rumble of mitral stenosis may be heard. These sounds may change when the patient changes position. Right atrial myxomas rarely produce symptoms until they have grown to be at least 13 cm (about 5 inches) wide. Tests may include: * Echocardiogram and Doppler study * Chest x-ray * CT scan of chest * Heart MRI * Left heart angiography * Right heart angiography * ECG‚Äîmay show atrial fibrillation Blood tests: A FBC may show anemia and increased WBCs (white blood cells). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is usually increased.

This can be done during the same surgery. Myxomas may come back if surgery did not remove all of the tumor cells. Prognosis An embolized fragment of an atrial myxoma in the iliac bifurcation. Although a myxoma is not malignant with risk of metastasis, complications are common. Untreated, a myxoma can lead to an embolism (tumor cells breaking off and traveling with the bloodstream). Myxoma fragments can move to the brain, eye, or limbs. If the tumor continues to enlarge inside the heart, it can block blood flow through the mitral valve and cause symptoms of mitral stenosis or mitral regurgitation. This may require emergency surgery to prevent sudden death.

Drawn by author Abraham van Westerveld in 1651. A monk's underground cell, seen with icons and other items. The Near Caves or the Caves of Saint AnthonyAnother name can be Caves of Saint Anthony because the relics of Saint Anthony are buried here.(, Blyzhni pechery; , Blizhnie peschery) are historic caves and a network of tunnels of the medieval cave monastery of Kyiv Pechersk Lavra in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. The Near Caves have a total length of 383 metres and are 5 to 20 metres deep (see map). The Near Caves were founded when in 1057, Saint Varlaam was appointed as the first hegumen (abbot) of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra by Saint Anthony. Monk Anthony withdrew himself from the monastery and later settled on a new hill, where he dug out a new underground cell, now called the Near Caves. Constructions The Near Caves contain the underground Church of Saint Anthony, the Church of the Entry of the Mother of God into the Temple, and the Saint Varlaam Church. The caves also have a total of 79 surviving burials, among them being Nestor the Chronicler, the icon artists Alipy and Grigory, the doctor Agapit, the prince-ascetic Nikolai Sviatosha, the holy martyr Kuksha, as well as the remains of the epic hero Ilya Muromets. During the examination of the remains, it was established that Ilya Muromets had died from a stab wound. According to a legend, a force of angels transported him from the place where he had died to the Lavra caverns. The Near Cave's main temple is the Church of the Elevation of the Cross (Khrestovozdvizhenska), which was constructed in the Ukrainian Baroque style from 1700-1704. The church's carved icons of 1769 have survived to this day. From the 19th century, the church served as a burial vault for the Kyiv Metropolitans. The old refectory of the church is connected to the brother's cells, a Neoclassical style building with a four-column portico dating from the 1830s. At the foot of the hill stands the Near Cave's belltower, which was designed and constructed by architect Stepan Kovnir in 1760. Also, the headstones of a number of well-known Kyivans can be seen in front of the Khrestovozdvizhenska Church, namely, the headstone of the general-governor Aleksandr Bezak, which was designed by architect Mikhail Ikonnikov in 1860). Beneath the Near Caverns, two old draw-wells were recently discovered. According to the legend one of them was dug by Saint Anthony and the other by his best-known disciple, Theodosius of Kyiv. Beside the draw-wells, a chapel was built, now known as the Church of the Life-Giving Spring, built in honour of the Icon of the Mother God.

The Swedish king Charles XII was in hot pursuit of king Augustus II the Strong of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and Saxony. The crossing was easily made, and the coalition troops were quickly broken and retreated.  Prelude  During the first year of fighting in the Great Northern War, Charles XII of Sweden had delivered two crushing defeats on his enemies. In July 1700, he forced Frederick IV of Denmark out of the coalition against Sweden, after a brief landing on Humleb√¶k. He then settled to aid the besieged Narva (which at the time belonged to the Swedish Empire). On his arrival, late November, he managed to decisively defeat the Russians despite being heavily outnumbered, in the battle of Narva, which led to an end of the Russian campaign for the year. Charles then turned his attention against the south and the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth to deal with his last opponent‚ÄîAugust the Strong‚Äîbefore going into Russia.Sundberg (2010), p. 206 The combined Saxon‚ÄìRussian army of totally 29,000 men had entrenched themselves across the 600 meter wide river of D√ºna under the command of Adam Heinrich von Steinau. Medallion of Charles Orders were sent from the Swedish king to the governor- general of Livonia, Erik Dahlbergh, in preparations for the crossing before the arrival of the Swedish main army. Dahlbergh was ordered to obtain around 200 landing boats of different sizes and was also instructed to build a bridge in order to transfer the cavalry across the river. The operation was supposed to be done in strict confidentiality to ensure a surprise attack on the enemies. The Swedish army of 14,000 men arrived at Riga on July 17, and already by the time, preparations for the attack were completed. However, bad weather ruined the Swedish plans to attack instantly, and the assault had to be postponed. A Swedish cavalry regiment was left to threaten Kokenhusen, effectively forcing Steinau to split his forces, thus the bulk of his army stayed across Riga. The allied army was initially under the command of Saxon general Otto Arnold von Paykull and Ferdinand Kettler of Courland, who were both ensured of an easy victory. In their confidence, they prioritized their numbers, advantageous position, redoubts and Saxon courage in superiority over the Swedes. Prior to the battle, Kettler pronounced: \\"even a superior force of three hundred thousands Swedes, would still not be enough, to successfully achieve any progress with the crossing\\". The Saxon army was, however, deployed a distance away from the beach, to ensure only a few Swedish regiments to land, before it would massively strike with its full capacity to drive the Swedes back and capture the Swedish king (who as they thought would be one among the few, to first step in land).  Battle  Charles XII is crossing the D√ºna Swedish floating battery, similar used at D√ºna During the evening of July 18, a little more than 6,000 Swedish infantry and 535 cavalry troops started to embark their landing boats in silence (there were about 195 boats of different structures and sizes, including four floating batteries with 10 cannons each and one corvette with 16 cannons). Swedish guns from Riga had continually bombarded the allied entrenchments across the river the same day and would continue doing so throughout the night and landing. After all the troops were embarked, the Swedes first torched some small boats on fire and pushed them out the river to obstruct the view for the allies with the deception (smoke),Tucker, S.C., 2010, A Global Chronology of Conflict, Vol. Two, Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, LLC, then at four o'clock in the morning of the 19th, the attack began. During their halfway reach, when the landing boats had gone around the island of Fossenholm (which had effectively blocked the sight of the Swedes), they got discovered and fired at. The four Swedish floating batteries returned fire, and after half an hour the Swedes reached the beach and were immediately thrown into fight against Saxon scouting patrols. When about 3,000 Swedish troops were ashore, the Saxons launched their first gathered assault of 3,500 men. However, the Swedish force under the personal command of the king himself, would not retreat and the attack was beaten back. The Swedes then sequentially stormed and took the nearby Garras redoubt which seized them ground of at least 200 steps inshore where they managed to establish a good foothold, covering the ongoing construction of the floating bridge. After having a brief stalemate, the Swedes formed up to initiate a second attack made by the Saxon general Otto Arnold von Paykull who strictly intended to drive them back before the arrival of further Swedish reinforcements. This attack, as the previous one, was repulsed. By this time the Saxon general Adam Heinrich von Steinau returned from Kokenhusen with large reinforcements and gained the command. He ordered a third assault on the Swedish stand, which at this time had almost every man ready from the landing. Since the Swedish left flank was protected by the river, Steinau gathered his cavalry in an attempt to attack the Swedish right which was rather unprotected. The attack had some success at first, but was subsequently beaten off after an ongoing attack in the rear by the Swedish cavalry. At seven o'clock in the morning, Saxon commander Heinrich von Steinau went for a council of war with his generals and decided to withdraw from the battle. Another wave was thrown at the Swedes in order to cover the retreat. However, bad weather prevented final constructions of the bridge which denied the crossing of the Swedish cavalry and so August II slipped away with his army. The Swedes lost 100 men dead and another 400 wounded.Ullgren (2008), p. 80-82 The allied forces lost about 1,300 dead and wounded and another 700 captured. 36 artillery pieces and four standards and banners had also been conquered by the Swedes.  Aftermath  Swedish bombardment of D√ºnam√ºnde, 1701 After the battle Charles laid siege and took Mitau (where he gained 8,000 muskets and 9,000 pistols to his supplies) and then stormed the Cobron redoubt where 400 Russians were stationed, only after a massacre the redoubt was taken with as few as twenty Russians still alive. Charles later laid siege to D√ºnamunde and shortly after started persecuting the retreating forces who had initially been 20,000 men strong during the fighting. The 10,000 strong Russian force under Anikita Ivanovich Repnin retreated towards Russia after having scarcely been participating in the main battle. The Saxons retreated to neutral Prussia and thus left all of Courland open for Charles who seized the initiative and took Kokenhusen.Kuvaja (2008), p. 148-153Svensson (2001), p. 61-62 In preparation for the crossing, king Charles XII had ordered to build the first bridge across the Daugava River, which was made of anchored and interconnected by ropes and boats. After the Swedish victory, the city was left with the structure. In 1705, the bridge, which had been lodged for the winter in Vƒìjzaƒ∑salas Bay, was washed away by the high spring waters. Later, the floating bridge was restored, but in 1710, it was again destroyed by the Russian army during the siege of Riga.Riga municipality portal During the battle, small barges armed with cannons were used, thus combining land and sea forces as well as deception (smoke) to achieve a stunning victory, carefully planned and very well executed. Participants included Otto Arnold von Paykull.

Life  He was born in Vercelli. He studied with G. A. Bissone at the church of St. Eusebius, and joined the Franciscan order in 1716. He was ordained as a priest in 1720. In 1722 he became an organist at St. Antonio in Padua, and would eventually become maestro there in 1730, succeeding maestro Calegari, and would hold that position for the next fifty years. Here he would meet and work with another theorist and composer named Giuseppe Tartini. Vallotti died in Padua on 10 January 1780.  Theory  Vallotti spent a great deal of thought on the theory of harmony and counterpoint. His theoretical endeavours would culminate in 1779 with the publishing of his 167-page, four volume work, Della scienza teorica e pratica della moderna musica (On the scientific theory and practice of modern music), just before the end of his life. One of his most frequently cited contributions to theory was his development of a system of Well temperament, known today as Vallotti temperament, which was one of many systems of instrumental tuning for the accommodation of composition in every key. Specifically, the six diatonic fifths F-C-G-D-A-E-B are all tuned 1/6 of a comma flat, while the remaining six fifths B-F#-C#-G#-D#-A#-F are all tuned pure. This leads to thirds quite close to pure (compared to equal temperament) in the 'home' keys of F, C and G major and in D, A, E and B minor. 1/6 comma extended meantone intonation (the 55-comma system) was the standard intonation ideal in the 18th century. On the other hand, there were very impure Pythagorean thirds in the remote keys of B, F# and C# major and in G#, Eb, Bb and F minor. The keys in between progressed from meantone to Pythagorean as the number of accidentals increased, with Eb and A major (the two 'intermediate' major keys) having thirds the same width as in modern 12-tone equal temperament. In effect, the 'simpler' the key, the closer it is to meantone intonation, and the more remote the key, the closer it is to Pythagorean intonation, and the 'middle' keys are similar to equal temperament. Young temperament (q.v.) No.2 has the same structure as Vallotti's, except that there the split happens at C rather than F: that is, the block of fifths C-G-D-A-E-B-F# are all tuned 1/6 of a comma flat, and F#-C#-G#-D#-A#-F-C are all tuned pure.  Work  Vallotti's extant compositions are entirely sacred in nature. They include: * Responsorial for four voices accompanied by harpsichord * Responsorial for sabbato sancto * Responsorial for coena domini Many of his works remain only in manuscript. These include: * 12 Introits for 5 and 8 voices * 24 Kyries, 24 Glorias, and 21 Credos for 4 and 5 voices * 68 Psalms for 2 and 8 voices and instruments * 46 Hymns * 10 Responsorials * 3 Dies Irae for 4 voices and instruments * 2 Pange lingua * 15 Tantum ergo * 2 Te Deum * 2 De profundis * 1 Sepulto domino, vespers and other compositions He also orchestrated 43 sacred pieces by his former master Calegari, and an Introit in 5 voices by Porta.

Coordinates A point of the complex projective plane may be described in terms of homogeneous coordinates, being a triple of complex numbers , where two triples describe the same point of the plane when the coordinates of one triple are the same as those of the other aside from being multiplied by the same nonzero factor. In this system, the points at infinity may be chosen as those whose z-coordinate is zero. The two circular points at infinity are two of these, usually taken to be those with homogeneous coordinates : and . Complexified circles A real circle, defined by its center point (x0,y0) and radius r (all three of which are real numbers) may be described as the set of real solutions to the equation :(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2=r^2. Converting this into a homogeneous equation and taking the set of all complex-number solutions gives the complexification of the circle. The two circular points have their name because they lie on the complexification of every real circle. More generally, both points satisfy the homogeneous equations of the type :Ax^2 + Ay^2 + 2B_1xz + 2B_2yz - Cz^2 = 0. The case where the coefficients are all real gives the equation of a general circle (of the real projective plane). In general, an algebraic curve that passes through these two points is called circular. Additional properties The circular points at infinity are the points at infinity of the isotropic lines.C. E. Springer (1964) Geometry and Analysis of Projective Spaces, page 141, W. H. Freeman and Company They are invariant under translations and rotations of the plane. The concept of angle can be defined using the circular points, natural logarithm and cross-ratio:Duncan Sommerville (1914) Elements of Non-Euclidean Geometry, page 157, link from University of Michigan Historical Math Collection :The angle between two lines is a certain multiple of the logarithm of the cross-ratio of the pencil formed by the two lines and the lines joining their intersection to the circular points. Sommerville configures two lines on the origin as u : y = x \\\\tan \\\\theta, \\\\quad u' : y = x \\\\tan \\\\theta ' . Denoting the circular points as œâ and œâ‚Ä≤, he obtains the cross ratio :(u u' , \\\\omega \\\\omega ') = \\\\frac{\\\\tan \\\\theta - i}{\\\\tan \\\\theta + i} \\\\div \\\\frac{\\\\tan \\\\theta ' - i}{\\\\tan \\\\theta ' + i} , so that :\\\\phi = \\\\theta ' - \\\\theta = \\\\tfrac{i}{2} \\\\log (u u', \\\\omega \\\\omega ') .

An isotropic line occurs only with an isotropic quadratic form, and never with a definite quadratic form. Using complex geometry, Edmond Laguerre first suggested the existence of two isotropic lines through the point that depend on the imaginary unit :Edmond Laguerre (1870) \\"Sur l‚Äôemploi des imaginaires en la g√©om√©trie\\", Oeuvres de Laguerre 2: 89 : First system: (y - \\\\beta) = (x - \\\\alpha) i, : Second system: (y - \\\\beta) = -i (x - \\\\alpha) . Laguerre then interpreted these lines as geodesics: :An essential property of isotropic lines, and which can be used to define them, is the following: the distance between any two points of an isotropic line situated at a finite distance in the plane is zero. In other terms, these lines satisfy the differential equation . On an arbitrary surface one can study curves that satisfy this differential equation; these curves are the geodesic lines of the surface, and we also call them isotropic lines. In the complex projective plane, points are represented by homogeneous coordinates (x_1, x_2, x_3) and lines by homogeneous coordinates (a_1, a_2, a_3). An isotropic line in the complex projective plane satisfies the equation:C. E. Springer (1964) Geometry and Analysis of Projective Spaces, page 141, W. H. Freeman and Company :a_3(x_2 \\\\pm i x_1) = (a_2 \\\\pm i a_1) x_2 . In terms of the affine subspace , an isotropic line through the origin is :x_2 = \\\\pm i x_1 . In projective geometry, the isotropic lines are the ones passing through the circular points at infinity. In the real orthogonal geometry of Emil Artin, isotropic lines occur in pairs: :A non-singular plane which contains an isotropic vector shall be called a hyperbolic plane. It can always be spanned by a pair N, M of vectors which satisfy N^2 \\\\ =\\\\ M^2\\\\ =\\\\ 0, \\\\quad NM\\\\ =\\\\ 1\\\\ . :We shall call any such ordered pair N, M a hyperbolic pair. If V is a non- singular plane with orthogonal geometry and N ‚â† 0 is an isotropic vector of V, then there exists precisely one M in V such that N, M is a hyperbolic pair. The vectors x N and y M are then the only isotropic vectors of V.Emil Artin (1957) Geometric Algebra, page 119 Relativity Isotropic lines have been used in cosmological writing to carry light. For example, in a mathematical encyclopedia, light consists of photons: \\"The worldline of a zero rest mass (such as a non-quantum model of a photon and other elementary particles of mass zero) is an isotropic line.\\"Encyclopedia of Mathematics World line For isotropic lines through the origin, a particular point is a null vector, and the collection of all such isotropic lines forms the light cone at the origin. √âlie Cartan expanded the concept of isotropic lines to multivectors in his book on spinors in three dimensions.

The species is endemic to Egypt and Libya. The species was once more widespread, but its numbers are now dwindling. The species is nearly extinct in Egypt, and complete extinction in the wild is a looming threat unless more actions are taken to protect this species. Etymology The specific name, kleinmanni, is in honor of Edouard Kleinmann, a French stockbroker who collected the holotype in 1875.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Testudo kleinmanni, p. 143). Description Belly of the Egyptian tortoise Kleinmann's tortoise is the smallest tortoise in the Northern Hemisphere. Female tortoises are larger than the males; males are more slender and have a longer tail. The plastron has a high dome, and ranges in color from ivory to pale gold to dark brown to pink or dull yellow. This colouring strongly follows Gloger's rule, as it helps to regulate the impact of sunlight. This allows the paler tortoise to stay in the desert heat for longer. It is also an effective camouflage in the desert. The carapace is light yellow, often with two dark triangles on each abdominal scute. The tortoise's scutes have dark edgings that fade with age. The head and limbs are a very pale ivory-yellow to yellowish-brown colour. Systematics The proposed subgenus Pseudotestudo is invalid, based on immature characters.Per√§l√§ (2003) It has been proposed to unite this species with the marginated tortoise in the genus Chersus. These clearly share a common ancestor with the common tortoise (Greek tortoise). The former two are somewhat more similar to each other than to the Greek tortoise regarding DNA sequence data.van der Kuyl et al. (2002), Fritz et al. (2005) Considering biogeography, however, this is either due to (rather unlikely) dispersal across the Mediterranean, or the supposed \\"clade\\" is invalid and the similarity due to convergent evolution. Negev tortoise The Negev subpopulation had been separated as a distinct species, \\"Negev tortoise\\" (Testudo werneri), as it did not appear to have distinct or strongly reduced haplotype diversity, consistent with the recent extinction of the Egyptian population and slow DNA sequence evolution rates in Testudo.van der Kuyl (2002) Baha el Din (2006) synonymized Testudo werneri due to lacking mtDNA differences between T. kleinmanni from western Libya compared to tortoises from the Negev Desert. In the 2017 checklist of turtles of the world, it remained a synonym. Image:Carapace T.werneri destra, T.kleinmanni sinistra.JPG|Characteristic specimens of the Egyptian tortoise (left) and Negev tortoise (right), dorsal view Image:Piastrone T. werneri destra , T.kleinmanni destra.JPG|Ventral view: Differences are slight and unreliable (see above) Habitat and Ecology Kleinmann's tortoise lives in deserts and semiarid habitats, usually with compact sand and gravel plains, scattered rocks, shallow, sandy wadis, dry woodlands, shrubby areas, and coastal salt marsh habitats. In captivity, it eats grasses, fruits, and vegetables, but the diet of T. kleinmanni in the wild is unknown. It is least active when the weather is very cold or very hot. During the colder months, it is out most during midday. During the warm season, it is active in the mornings and evenings. The rest of the day is spent under bushes or in rodent burrows. Reproduction Kleinmann's tortoise becomes sexually mature when about 5 years old. In the wild, mating has only been observed in March, but in captivity, it mates in April and August to November. During courtship, the male will ram the female, sometimes chasing after her. Unlike any other Mediterranean tortoise, T. kleinmanni may make a mating call similar to the call of the mourning dove. Eggs are laid in shallow bowls beneath bushes, or in vacant burrows. Each clutch contains one to five eggs, which hatch in the summer or early autumn. Status and conservation Once found in Egypt and Libya, the habitat of T. kleinmanni in Egypt has been all but destroyed, and the Egyptian tortoise is close to complete extinction there. Two populations can still be found in Libya, but much of the coastline habitat has been destroyed because of human activity. Habitat loss and the illegal pet trade are huge issues facing the species; it is also hunted locally for use in folk medicine.da N√≥brega Alves et al. (2008) The population is still on the decline, and the risk of extinction in the wild is very real if habitat degradation and illegal trade continue at their present rate. On the IUCN Redlist, Kleinmann's tortoise is classified as CR A2abcd+3d. Less than three Testudo generations ago, an estimated 55-56,000 adult Kleinmann's tortoises existed. Today, about 7,500 remain, and decline due to habitat destruction and unsustainable exploitation appears to be ongoing. While the former threat is believed to be alleviated, illegal pet trade is feared to have reduced the population to maybe 1,000 adult tortoises in the two or three remaining subpopulations. Given that T. kleinmanni is a slow-maturing, long-lived species with few offspring (see K-strategist), This is well possibly less than the minimum viable population, eventually dooming the species to extinction in the wild. Mixing individuals from the subpopulations for reintroduction purposes should be avoided, as the ecological parameters of habitat differ.See Per√§l√§ (2001) and above for identification DNA fingerprinting of individuals to help maintain heterozygosity in captive and reintroduction populations can be performed during routine stool analyses. In this context, notably, there may be a haplotype uniquely found in the Egyptian tortoise.≈†irok√Ω & Fritz (2007) Captive breeding requires more care than in other Testudo species, as the species is more delicate and the clutch is very small, but is not highly difficult for experienced Testudo breeders. T. kleinmanni is not generally available for hobbyists and even if legal to keep, should be avoided without valid documentation. Smuggling continues to be a problem, but confiscated individuals are used to establish a captive safeguard population. On May 21, 2007, Rome's main zoo, Bioparco, reported it has successfully bred the species from parents rescued from a smuggler's suitcase in 2005. It is also kept and bred at several other zoos in Europe and North America.

TSMP devices stay synchronized to each other and communicate in time-slots, similar to other TDM (time-division multiplexing) systems. Such deterministic communication allows the devices to stay extremely low power, as the radios only turn on for the periods of scheduled communication. The protocol is designed to operate very reliably in a noisy environment. It uses channel hopping to avoid interference -- the packets between TSMP devices get sent on different radio channels depending on time of transmission. TSMP distinguishes itself from other time-slotted mesh-based protocols, in that time-slot timing is maintained continuously and enables a network to duty-cycle on a transmitter-receiver pair-wise basis, as opposed to putting the entire network to sleep for extended periods of time (as is done in a beacon-based protocol, such as DigiMesh). Dust Networks' underlying time synchronized mesh networking technology has been standardized by the HART Communications Foundation with the WirelessHART protocol, the International Society of Automation ISA100 standard and in internet protocol standards, such as IEEE802.15.4E MAC layer, and IETF 6TiSCh.

Until fairly recently, over 600 species of cone snails were all classified under one genus, Conus, in one family, the Conidae. However, in recent years, it was suggested that cone snails should occupy only a subfamily that should be split into a very large number of genera. A 2014 paper attempted to stabilize a newer classification of the group, significantly reducing the number of new genera but keeping a fairly large number of subgenera. Although the taxonomy has changed significantly several times during recent years, in the current (2015) version of the taxonomy of these snails and their close relatives, cone snails once again compose the entire family Conidae. Geologically speaking, fossils of cone snails are known from the Eocene to the Holocene epochs. Pek I., Va≈°√≠ƒçek Z., Roƒçek Z., Hajn. V. & Mikul√°≈° R. (1996). Z√°klady zoopaleontologie. Olomouc, 264 pp., . Cone snail species have shells that are shaped more or less like geometric cones. Many species have colorful patterning on the shell surface. Cone snails are almost all tropical in distribution. Because all cone snails are venomous and capable of \\"stinging\\" humans, live ones should never be handled, as their venomous sting will occur without warning and can be fatal. The species most dangerous to humans are the larger cones, which prey on small bottom-dwelling fish; the smaller species mostly hunt and eat marine worms. Cone snails use a hypodermic needle‚Äìlike modified radula tooth and a venom gland to attack and paralyze their prey before engulfing it. The tooth, which is sometimes likened to a dart or a harpoon, is barbed and can be extended some distance out from the head of the snail, at the end of the proboscis. Cone snail venoms are mainly peptides. The venoms contain many different toxins that vary in their effects; some are extremely toxic. The sting of small cones is no worse than a bee sting, but the sting of a few of the larger species of tropical cone snails can be serious, occasionally even fatal to humans. Cone snail venom is showing great promise as a source of new, medically important substances. Distribution and habitat There are over 900 different species of cone snails.Bouchet, P.; Gofas, S. (2015). Conus Linnaeus, 1758. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at marinespecies.org on 2015-03-29 Cone snails are typically found in warm and tropical seas and oceans worldwide, and they reach their greatest diversity in the Western Indo-Pacific region. However, some species are adapted to temperate/semi tropical environments, such as the Cape coast of South Africa,Tenorio, M. J. & Monteiro, A. J. (2008). The Family Conidae.

Hackenheim: ConchBooks. 112 pp., 88 pls. and are endemic to these areas. Cone snails are found in all tropical and subtropical seas, from the intertidal zone to deeper areas, living on sand or among rocks or coral reefs. When living on sand, these snails bury themselves with only the siphon protruding from the surface. Many tropical cone snails live in or near coral reefs. Some species are found under rocks in the lower intertidal and shallow subtidal zones. They can be incredibly deadly. Shell description This group of sea snails shows a large variety of colors and patterns, and local varieties and color forms of the same species often occur. This has led to the creation of a large number of known synonyms and probable synonyms, making it difficult to give an exact taxonomic assignment for many snails in this genus. As of 2009, more than 3,200 different species names have been assigned, with an average of 16 new species names introduced each year.The Conus biodiversity website The shells of cone snails vary in size. The shells are shaped more or less like the geometric shape known as a cone, as one might expect from the popular and scientific name. The shell is many-whorled and in the form of an inverted cone, the anterior end being the narrow end. The protruding parts of the top of the whorls that form the spire are more or less in the shape of another, much more flattened, cone. The aperture is elongated and narrow. The horny operculum is very small. The outer lip is simple, thin, and sharp, is without a callus, and has a notched tip at the upper part. The columella is straight. The larger species of cone snails can grow up to in length. The shells of cone snails are often brightly colored and have interesting patterns, although in some species the color patterns may be partially or completely hidden under an opaque layer of periostracum. In other species, the topmost shell layer is thin periostracum, a transparent yellowish or brownish membrane. Life habits Cone snails are carnivorous and predatory. They hunt and eat prey such as marine worms, small fish, molluscs, and even other cone snails. Because cone snails are slow-moving, they use a venomous harpoon (called a toxoglossan radula) to capture faster-moving prey, such as fish. The venom of a few larger species, especially the piscivorous ones, is powerful enough to kill a human being. The osphradium (a chemoreceptory organ) is more highly specialized than the same organ in any other group of gastropods. It is through this sensory modality that cone snails become aware of the presence of a prey animal, not through vision. The cone snails immobilize their prey using a modified, dartlike, barbed radular tooth, made of chitin, along with a venom gland containing neurotoxins. Small species of these cone snails hunt small prey, such as marine worms, whereas larger cone snails hunt fish. Molecular phylogeny research by Kraus et al. (2010) based on a part of \\"intron 9\\" of the gamma-glutamyl carboxylase gene has shown that feeding on fish has evolved at least twice independently in the group.  Harpoon and venoms  An individual Conus pennaceus attacking one of a cluster of three snails of the species Cymatium nicobaricum, in Hawaii Cone snails use a radula tooth as a harpoon-like structure for predation. Each of these harpoons is a modified tooth, primarily made of chitin and formed inside the mouth of the snail, in a structure known as the toxoglossan radula. (The radula in most gastropods has rows of many small teeth, and is used for grasping at food and scraping it into the mouth.) Each specialized cone snail tooth is stored in the radula sac (an everted pocket in the posterior wall of the buccal cavity), except the tooth that is currently ready to be used. The radular-tooth structures differ slightly according to the feeding mode of vermivorous, molluscivorous and piscivorous species. The tooth is hollow and barbed, and is attached to the tip of the radula in the radular sac, inside the snail's throat. When the snail detects a prey animal nearby, it extends a long flexible tube called a proboscis towards the prey. The radula tooth is loaded with venom from the venom bulb and, still attached to the radula, is fired from the proboscis into the prey by a powerful muscular contraction. The venom paralyzes small fish almost instantly. The snail then retracts the radula, drawing the subdued prey into the mouth. After the prey has been digested, the cone snail will regurgitate any indigestible material, such as spines and scales, along with the then-disposable harpoon. There is always a dart stored in the radular sac. A dart may be used in self-defense when the snail feels threatened.National Geographic Cone Snail Profile The venom of cone snails contains hundreds of different compounds, and its exact composition varies widely from one species to another. The toxins in these various venoms are called conotoxins. These are various peptides, each targeting a specific nerve channel or receptor. Some cone snail venoms also contain a pain-reducing toxin, which the snail uses to pacify the victim before immobilising and then killing it. Relevance to humans  Risks  A live textile cone, Conus textile, one of the dangerous cones to handle. The bright colors and patterns of cone snails are attractive, hence people sometimes pick up the live animals. This is risky, because the snail often fires its harpoon in these situations. In the case of the larger species of cone snail, the harpoon is sometimes capable of penetrating skin, gloves or wetsuits. The sting of many of the smallest cone species may be no worse than that of a bee or hornet sting,Marine wounds and stings but in the case of a few of the larger tropical fish-eating species, especially Conus geographus, Conus tulipa and Conus striatus, a sting can sometimes have fatal consequences. Other dangerous species are Conus pennaceus, Conus textile, Conus aulicus, Conus magus and Conus marmoreus. According to Goldfrank's Toxicologic Emergencies, about 27 human deaths can be confidently attributed to cone snail envenomation, though the actual number is almost certainly much higher; some three dozen people are estimated to have died from geography cone envenomation alone. Most of the cone snails that hunt worms rather than fish are probably not a risk to humans, with the possible exception of larger species. One of the fish-eating species, the geography cone, Conus geographus, is also known colloquially as the \\"cigarette snail\\", a gallows humor exaggeration implying that, when stung by this creature, the victim will have only enough time to smoke a cigarette before dying.NIGMS - Findings, September 2002: Secrets of the Killer SnailsGeographic Cone Snail, Geographic Cone Snail Profile, Facts, Information, Photos, Pictures, Sounds, Habitats, Reports, News - National Geographic Symptoms of a more serious cone snail sting include intense, localized pain, swelling, numbness and tingling and vomiting. Symptoms can start immediately or can be delayed for days. Severe cases involve muscle paralysis, changes in vision, and respiratory failure that can lead to death.  Medical use of the venom  The appeal of the cone snail's venom for creating pharmaceutical drugs is the precision and speed with which the various components act; many of the compounds target a particular class of receptor, to the exclusion of any other. This means that, in isolation, they can reliably and quickly produce a particular effect on the body's systems without side effects; for example, almost instantly reducing heart rate or turning off the signaling of a single class of nerve, such as pain receptors. Ziconotide, a pain reliever 1,000 times as powerful as morphine, was initially isolated from the venom of the magician cone snail, Conus magus. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December 2004 under the name \\"Prialt\\". Other drugs are in clinical and preclinical trials, such as compounds of the toxin that may be used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, and epilepsy. Many peptides produced by the cone snails show prospects for being potent pharmaceuticals, such as AVC1, isolated from the Australian species, the Queen Victoria cone, Conus victoriae. This has proven very effective in treating postsurgical and neuropathic pain, even accelerating recovery from nerve injury. Geography cone and tulip cone are known to secrete a type of insulin to cause hypoglycaemic shock in nearby fish, paralyzing them. They are the only two species known to use insulin as a natural weapon. This is interesting for biochemists for determining structure-function relationships in this protein.  Shell collecting  The intricate color patterns of cones have made them one of the most popular collectible shells.Conus gloriamaris Conus gloriamaris, the \\"Glory of the Seas\\" cone, was, in earlier centuries, one of the most famous and sought-after seashells, with only a few specimens in private collections. This apparent rarity meant that shells of this species fetched very high prices, until finally the habitat for this cone was discovered. Sizable populations were then located, and this brought the price down dramatically.Conus gloriamaris, Glory of the Seas Cone photos, Phillip Colla Natural History Photography :: Online Photo Search As jewelry Naturally occurring, beachworn cone shell \\"tops\\" (the broken-off spire of the shell, which usually end up with a hole worn at the tip) can function as beads without any further modification. In Hawaii, these natural beads were traditionally collected from the beach drift to make puka shell jewelry. Since it is difficult to obtain enough naturally occurring cone tops, almost all modern puka shell jewelry uses cheaper imitations, cut from thin shells of other species of mollusk, or made of plastic. Species Prior to 2009, all species within the family Conidae were still placed in one genus Conus. Testing in order to try to understand the molecular phylogeny of the Conidae was initially begun by Christopher Meyer and Alan Kohn, and is continuing, particularly with the advent of nuclear DNA testing in addition to mDNA testing. In 2009, J.K. Tucker and M.J. Tenorio proposed a classification system consisting of three distinct families and 82 genera for the living species of cone snails. This classification was based on shell morphology, radular differences, anatomy, physiology, and cladistics, with comparisons to molecular (DNA) studies.Tucker J.K. & Tenorio M.J. (2009), Systematic Classification of Recent and Fossil Conoidean Gastropods, ConchBooks, Hankenheim, Germany, 295 pp. Published accounts of genera within the Conidae that use these new genera include J.K. Tucker & M.J. Tenorio (2009), and Bouchet et al. (2011). Tucker and Tenorio's proposed classification system for the cone shells and their allies (and the other clades of Conoidean gastropods) is shown in Tucker & Tenorio cone snail taxonomy 2009. Some experts, however, preferred to use the traditional classification, where all species are placed in Conus within the single family Conidae: for example, according to the November 2011 version of the World Register of Marine Species, all species within the family Conidae were placed in the genus Conus. The binomial names of species in the 82 genera of living cone snails listed in Tucker & Tenorio 2009 were recognized by the World Register of Marine Species as \\"alternative representations\\".Classification: Traditionally, all cone shells were included in the Linnaean genus Conus. Tucker & Tenorio (2009) proposed an alternative shell- and radula-based classification that recognized 4 families and 80 genera of cones. In 2011, WoRMS, still recognized a single family Conidae (following Puillandre et al. 2011), but Tucker & Tenorio's 80 genera classification was presented as \\"alternative representation\\". P. Bouchet, 14 August 2011 Debate within the scientific community regarding this issue continued, and additional molecular phylogeny studies were being carried out in an attempt to clarify the issue.C.M.L.

In 2015, in the Journal of Molluscan Studies, Puillandre, Duda, Meyer, Olivera & Bouchet presented a new classification for the old genus Conus. Using 329 species, the authors carried out molecular phylogenetic analyses. The results suggested that the authors should place all cone snails in a single family, Conidae, containing four genera: Conus, Conasprella, Profundiconus and Californiconus.

Bolsterstone had a population of 386 in 2011.Bolsterstone is made up of Output Area E00041273 in the Stocksbridge and Upper Don ward http://ukcensusdata.com/stocksbridge-and-upper-don-e00041273#A39e7ccp.dpbs Geography and history Bolsterstone is less than 1 km south of the town of Stocksbridge within the civil parish of Stocksbridge,Ordnance survey. 1:25000. c.2012 and the electoral ward of Stocksbridge and Upper Don. The village is at a height of around above sea level on the northern side of the east‚Äìwest Ewden valley, north of Broomhead and More Hall reservoirs. The origin of the name \\"Bolsterstone\\" is unknown; it may a corruption of the root word \\"Walder\\" (also used in local place names, including a barrow), or may refer to two large stones in the village, which are referred to as the \\"Bolster Stones\\". The village is thought to have been established in the Anglo-Saxon period.Bolsterstone Conservation Area Appraisal (2009), 3.3‚Äì3.4 St Mary's Church, Bolsterstone was founded in 1412, and a fortified manor house (\\"Bolsterstone castle\\") is thought to have been built by an Earl of Shrewsbury.Bolsterstone Conservation Area Appraisal (2009), 3.5‚Äì3.6 Two buildings dating from the 16th or 17th centuries are thought to be remnants of the castle: Castle Cottages are mostly 19th-century with parts of walls dating from the earlier period; Porters Lodge, also mostly 19th-century, is thought to contain elements of the castle gatehouse. A Free School was built in the village in 1686 (rebuilt 1780). Land around the village was enclosed after 1778, and St. Mary's church was rebuilt in the 1790s.Bolsterstone Conservation Area Appraisal (2009), 3.9‚Äì3.11 In 1802 the entire manor of Bolsterstone, over was put up for sale, and acquired by James Rimington.Bolsterstone Conservation Area Appraisal (2009), 3.12 The Castle Inn was built in 1840;Bolsterstone Area (S&DHS;), The Castle Inn Public House Bolsterstone National School in 1851/2 and the Free School rebuilt in 1857;Bolsterstone Area (S&DHS;), Bolsterstone Schools and a vicarage built in 1862; between 1872 and 1879 St Mary's church was again rebuilt.Bolsterstone Conservation Area Appraisal (2009), 3.13‚Äì3.16 As of 2009 the village functions as a residential village; the village has no shops, and both schools have closed; the National School building is used as a village hall.Bolsterstone Conservation Area Appraisal (2009), 3.17, 4.4‚Äì4.5 The Peak District Boundary Walk runs through the village.

His most usual demarcation as a player was centre backcourt. Life and career He was born in Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic in the former Soviet Union, and started his playing career in CSKA Moscow. He participated on the 1992 Olympic Games as a member of the Unified Team and won the gold medal. He also became the top scorer of the games with 47 goals and was elected into the dream team of the tournament.Base d'informazi√≥n esportiva One year later he participated on the 1993 World Championships as a member of the Russian team and won the gold medal again. After the 1992 Olympics he signed for Teka Cantabria and a few years later he received the Spanish citizenship. Afterwards he played in the Spain national handball team for nearly a decade, gaining two Olympic bronze medals in 1996 and 2000, and silver and bronze medals on the European championships. He also gained several individual recognitions in the world championships, like being elected as the best player of the tournament in 1997, but he failed to win any medals with the Spanish team, which finished 4th in both 1999 and 2003. Ironically when Spain finally won the world championship in 2005, Dujshebaev was no longer the member of the squad. In 2001, after playing for a few years in Germany on club level, he returned to Spain and signed for BM Ciudad Real where he finished his playing career in 2007. In 2005 he became player-manager of the team, and after his retirement he became the full-time manager. His managerial successes include multiple Liga ASOBAL wins with the team, as well as winning the EHF Champions League in 2006, 2008 and 2009. In 2006 he briefly returned to the field, when one of the Ciudad center backcourt players, Uro≈° Zorman injured. He was voted twice as the IHF World Player of the Year, in 1994 and in 1996. He also came in second in the IHF World Player of the Century voting behind Magnus Wislander from Sweden.Men's Legends ‚Äì Talant Dushebaev In 2014 (8 January) he replaced Bogdan Wenta as head coach of PGE Vive Kielce.BREAKING NEWS: Dujshebaev is new coach of Kielce ‚Äì Wenta as a manager Contemporaneously with his job in Kielce, he has been also coaching the Hungarian men's national handball team since October 8, 2014 until 2016.Talant Dujshebaev az √∫j kapit√°ny He also coached Poland during the 2016 Summer Olympics and the 2017 World Men's Handball Championship in France.

Hatton continues, : Hence it follows that an imaginary straight line is determined by an imaginary point, which is a double point of an involution, and a real point, the vertex of the involution pencil.

Life and career  Duval attended the Coll√®ge de Libourne, appearing in the play Les Plus beaux yeux du monde by Jean Sarment. Her father, a colonel, allowed her to enrol in the theatre classes at the Conservatoire de Bordeaux, where she was spotted by the director, Gaston Poulet, who got her into the vocal classes.Laurent, Fran√ßois. Hommage : Denise Duval. Diapason, No.644, March 2016, p16-17. From there she made her debut in Cavalleria rusticana at the Grand Theatre de Bordeaux in 1942, her Santuzza described by the Libert√© du Sud-Ouest critic as ‚Äúpainful, fierce, tragic‚Äù, leading to other principal roles in Bordeaux. In Paris she was disappointed at her audition at the Op√©ra, but was soon engaged at the Folies-Berg√®re, and sang in the clothed revue, gaining more stage experience; she later commented \\"Aux Folies, j'ai tout appris!\\". At her second try for an operatic position Duval was engaged for L'Aiglon (which she never sang), but made her debut at the Op√©ra-Comique in the title role of Madame Butterfly on 5 March 1947.Wolff, St√©phane.

This definition can be widened to a complex projective space of arbitrary finite dimension as follows: : (u_1, u_2, \\\\ldots, u_n) are the homogeneous coordinates of a real point if there exists a nonzero complex number such that the coordinates of : (\\\\lambda u_1, \\\\lambda u_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\lambda u_n) are all real.  Context  Geometries that are specializations of real projective geometry, such as Euclidean geometry, elliptic geometry or conformal geometry may be complexified, thus embedding the points of the geometry in a complex projective space, but retaining the identity of the original real space as special. Lines, planes etc. are expanded to the lines, etc. of the complex projective space. As with the inclusion of points at infinity and complexification of real polynomials, this allows some theorems to be stated more simply without exceptions and for a more regular algebraic analysis of the geometry. Viewed in terms of homogeneous coordinates, a real vector space of homogeneous coordinates of the original geometry is complexified. A point of the original geometric space is defined by an equivalence class of homogeneous vectors of the form , where is an nonzero complex value and is a real vector. A point of this form (and hence belongs to the original real space) is called a real point, whereas a point that has been added through the complexification and thus does not have this form is called an imaginary point.

The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells motor vehicles, and is one of the Earth's most important economic sectors by revenue. The first practical automobile with a petrol engine was built by Karl Benz in 1885 in Mannheim, Germany. 1983 saw a great number of new model launches in Europe, with the popularity of the hatchback bodystyle continuing to gather pace and now being the most popular bodystyle in many countries. United Kingdom British Leyland has had another busy year. The Austin Allegro has finally ended its production life after 10 years, following the launch of its successor - the Maestro. The new car is built at the Cowley plant in Oxford, and is sold as a five-door hatchback with an exceptionally spacious interior. It is hardly the best looking car in the world, but features many novel \\"extras\\" including a bonded laminated windscreen, body- coloured plastic bumpers, an electric engine management system and a standard five-speed gearbox - features which are still rare on comparable modern day family cars. Another novel feature which appeared on the more expensive Vanden Plas & MG versions is a digital instrument panel and a trip-computer which talks and also alerts the driver of any problems although the feature would soon be dropped. Power comes from 1.3 and 1.6 petrol engines, and there is also a more powerful MG version (the MG Maestro 1600) which uses the 1.6 R-Series engine and is capable of 110 mph. Interior space, asking price and running costs are the car's strongest points, and a saloon version is expected next year to give British Leyland an up-to-date rival for the Ford Sierra. The big news for Vauxhall in 1983 was the introduction of an all-new supermini- the Nova, which replaces the Chevette although that model continued with a reduced range until January 1984. It is built in Spain and sold on the continent as the Opel Corsa since the autumn of 1982. 1.0, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 petrol engines provide power, but these power units are more biased towards fuel economy. The Nova will be sold as a hatchback (three or five doors) and a saloon (two and four doors), an almost unique record number of bodystyles for such a small car. An estate version of the Cavalier launched in October and is based upon the Australian Holden Camira sharing its body panels with a choice of 3 trim-levels. Ford maintained its position as Britain's most popular brand of car and this was helped by two significant changes to the model line-up. The seven-year-old Fiesta receives a major restyle and becomes the MK2 with the addition of an impressively stylish and fast XR2 \\"hot hatch\\" going on sale in late August. In addition to the Fiesta, the company range is expanded with the launch of a brand new 4 door saloon. With the expensive range-topping Granada being Ford's only saloon after the demise of the Cortina, the Orion - as it will be known - is one of the largest cars in its mid-range class with sales starting in September. Its upmarket image is also helped by the inclusion of only GL and Ghia trim levels, with the entry-level 1.1 engine being the only power unit from the Escort on which it is based not to feature in the Orion as well. The Escort receives a minor update including new badging at the rear and the addition of a 5-door estate model. Germany General Motors have added a substantial new executive car to the Opel range in the shape of the Senator. Similar in size to the Opel Rekord, the Senator was previously seen in Britain as the Vauxhall Royale, but with that model's demise the Senator will be imported for approximately one year until the Vauxhall-badged version is launched. It is powered by an impressive 3.0 V6 engine and has a spacious, luxurious and comfortable interior. With the Rekord competing against the likes of the Ford Granada, Rover SD1 and Audi 100, the Senator could be Opel's long-awaited answer to the BMW 5 Series. Volkswagen has called time on the first generation Golf after nine years and an estimated 10,000,000 sales. It has been the world's best selling car of the last decade, a position that has been achieved by solid build quality, cast iron reliability, a smooth ride, strong handling, high levels of practicality and a comfortable interior. The 1.6 GTI kicked off a worldwide demand for \\"hot hatchbacks\\" which is getting higher all the time. The MK2 Golf has power units ranging from an economical 1.3 to the impressively fast 1.8 GTI. It carries on all the virtues that made the original Golf such a success. And for traditionalists who prefer saloons over hatchbacks, there is the Jetta - a comfortable four-door saloon which has all the Golf's hallmarks plus the advantage of having the largest boot of any current production car. UK sales started in March 1984. Italy The regeneration of Fiat begins with the launch of an impressive all-new supermini, the Uno, a product of Giugiaro's ItalDesign studio. It replaces the veteran 127, and is the most innovative small hatchback ever seen in Europe. Its interior space and fuel economy are first rate, with visual appeal also high on the agenda. Power comes from 900cc, 1.1 and 1.3 petrol engines, with three and five-door hatchback bodystyles making it a practical choice for those who place function above power. It so impressed Europe's motoring press that they voted it European Car of the Year. Fiat has also given its five-year-old Ritmo/Strada a major facelift which sheds some of the original design's quirks that put so many potential buyers off. The new look is more restrained and gives Fiat hope of continuing already strong sales for its entrant in Europe's most competitive sector. Alfa Romeo has launched the Arna as part of a joint venture with Japanese manufacturer Nissan. The new range of three and five-door hatchbacks are built in Naples on the same production line as the Nissan Cherry Europe - the first \\"Japanese\\" car to be built in Europe. With Alfa Romeo customers suspicious of Nissan handling and Nissan customers even more so of Alfa Romeo build quality, the idea is a risky one which might not succeed. For buyers seeking the traditional Alfa Romeo virtues of flair and fun, the new 33 has gone on sale as successor to the long-running Alfasud and Alfetta ranges. When Fiat acquired Alfa Romeo in 1986, production of the model was swiftly terminated. France The long-awaited hatchback version of the R9 has finally arrived ‚Äì two years after the launch of the saloon upon which it is based. The new Renault 11 is a range of three and five-door hatchbacks which are direct competitors for the new Volkswagen Golf. It uses the same engines and suspension as the R9, but is a shade more practical thanks to it being a hatchback. The new model will also be sold in the US as the Renault Encore, where it will join the R9's American twin ‚Äì the Alliance ‚Äì in Renault's bid to gain popularity on the far side of the Atlantic. After a succession of technically sound but visually dull models, the new Peugeot 205 has arrived like a whirlwind. Stylish, ultra-modern Pininfarina-styled body, supple ride, and excellent handling are the key elements in the excitement which has arisen from the launch of this promising new supermini with three or five-door models. It is designed as an eventual replacement for the ageing 104, though that model is still being produced for the home market until 1988. The 205, meanwhile, has a wide range of engines from an ecomical 954cc unit to a blistering 1.9 powerplant that fits under the bonnet of the range-topping GTI. There is also a smooth and economical 1.8 diesel unit for customers looking for a frugal oil burner. Citro√´n has expanded its range in the UK by importing the LNA three-door hatchback which has been sold in its homeland since 1978. The model was a slow seller there and couldn't compete with the influx of new superminis that launched during 1983 and was axed after 2 years. There are no plans, however, for the base LN model to be imported across the channel. August 1983 also saw the arrival in the UK of the BX family hatchback which was launched on the continent the previous autumn. Japan Nissan has confirmed that the Datsun badge is to be withdrawn from the entire model range after this year and that the Nissan badge will be universal. The first car to wear this badge is the all-new Micra, a small three-door hatchback powered by economical 1.0 and 1.2 petrol engines. It is aimed directly at the likes of the Austin Metro and Ford Fiesta, promising class-leading levels of quality and economy. It is expected to be an eventual replacement for the Cherry, which is slightly larger. Toyota has announced a new version of its Starlet supermini which will go on sale in early 1984. The new Starlet is one of the last small cars to switch from rear-drive to front-drive, carrying over the previous model's 1.0 and 1.3 petrol engines though dropping the 1.2 unit. It will be the latest of many Japanese challengers to the Fiesta/Metro/Nova dominance of the British supermini market, arriving shortly after another highly competent Oriental car in the shape of Nissan's Micra. Honda has redesigned its Civic range for the second time in four years. The new model has a longer wheelbase and a wider range, this time including the \\"Shuttle\\" high-roof estate car and the \\"CRX\\" coupe. Also new to the range is a 1.5 12-valve petrol engine which is also set to debut in the next generation Honda Ballade, which is set to be produced in Britain as the latest product of a Honda-British Leyland venture.

He worked in Hollywood during the 1920s and was Coco Chanel's lover from 1931 to his death. Early life and career Joseph Paul Iribe was born in Angoul√™me, France in 1883, of a father born in Pau (B√©arn), Jules Jean Iribe (1836-1914). Iribe received his education in Paris. From 1908 to 1910 he studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts and the College Rollin.  Illustrator and designer  At age seventeen Iribe provided illustrations for the popular L'Assiette au Beurre and also contributed drawings and caricatures for French satirical papers such as Le Rire, Le Sourire, and La Ba√Øonnette. His reputation grew, and it was said, ‚Äúno one could sketch an event more tellingly.‚ÄùCharles-Roux, Edmonde, \\"Chanel and her world,\\" Hachette-Vendome, 1981, p. 242 He was one of a talented group of like illustrators including George Barbier, Georges Lepape, Charles Martin, and Pierre Brissaud. Their modernist style, informed by both the vitality of the revolutionary art movements of the era, and by the flat planes and minimalism identified with Japanese painting served to revitalize the popularity of the fashion plate. These fashion plates were hand colored using the pochoir process, whereby stencils and metal plates are used allowing for colors to be built up and gradually nuanced according to the artist‚Äôs vision. The fashion plate, in use for some time, was in essence an advertising tool‚Äîa piece of artwork used to create desire for the newest clothing looks aimed at an audience of the fashionable and moneyed. Iribe‚Äôs work is primarily distinguished by the illustrations he executed for style journals such as La Gazette du Bon Ton where his charming vignettes of the latest modes helped promote the designs of couturiers such as Paul Poiret. The appeal of these illustrations lay in their depiction of stylish women pursuing the everyday activities of an affluent life style. Iribe's design career was a prolific one, contributing text and visuals to Vogue magazine, designing fabrics, furniture, rugs and doing interior design work for wealthy clients.Vaughan, Hal, \\"Sleeping With The Enemy, Coco Chanel's Secret War,\\" Alfred A> Knopf, 2011, p. 78  Design aesthetic  Iribe favored the liberal display of fluid forms, more in concordance with the design elements which were the hallmark of the Art Nouveau movement‚Äîpoufs, lam√© textiles; walls hung with tapestries, and carpeted floors. He was hostile to the new school of industrial design, and provided his own terse critique of the Art Deco Exposition of 1925: ‚Äúthe alliance between Art and the cube.‚Äù In 1933, Iribe collaborated with Coco Chanel in the design of extravagant jewelry pieces commissioned by the International Guild of Diamond Merchants. The collection, executed exclusively in diamonds and platinum, was exhibited for public viewing and drew a large audience; some three thousand attendees were recorded in a one-month period.  Association with Paul Poiret  Iribe illustration of modes by couturier Paul Poiret The couturier Paul Poiret recognized Iribe‚Äôs talent and brought him in to create drawings, which would compellingly represent the new models in his collection. These illustrations were later compiled into an album, ‚ÄùLes Robes de Paul Poiret racont√©e par Paul Iribe‚Äù published in 1908. The book created a controversy, as Poiret‚Äôs design aesthetic promoted clothing with a relaxed line, emphatically denouncing the corseted look so long in vogue as the mandated female silhouette. In ‚ÄúPortraits-Souvenirs,‚Äù Jean Cocteau made a wry observation: ‚ÄúIribe‚Äôs album disgusts mothers.‚Äù Contentious opinion, however, fueled a public debate providing Poiret with the publicity that ultimately brought him success. Poiret‚Äôs success also proved a triumph for Iribe.Charles-Roux, Edmonde, \\"Chanel and her world,\\" Hachette-Vendome, 1981, p. 242-243  Hollywood  In 1919 Iribe was in Hollywood recruited for design work by film director Cecil B. DeMille. Iribe and DeMille were ideally paired collaborators sharing a penchant for luxury replete with all the entailing visual drama. DeMille allowed Iribe complete creative freedom. In Hollywood, Iribe practiced the same design sensibilities for which he was renowned in Paris. His depiction of Egypt for DeMille‚Äôs 1923 The Ten Commandments was not a Biblical rendition but pure Hollywood fantasy, all lacquered glamour and opulence.Roux, Edmonde, \\"Chanel and her world,\\" Hachette-Vendome, 1981, p. 243 In 1924 Iribe was given free rein in a film project for which he was director, set designer and costumer, Changing Husbands starring Leatrice Joy. The character of the male protagonist represented Iribe himself, the novice director having reconstituted his own image for the screen. The film proved to be a critical disaster. The New York Times gave it a scathing review, calling the film absurd, and the direction ‚Äúamateurish.‚ÄùCharles-Roux, Edmonde, \\"Chanel and her world,\\" Hachette-Vendome, 1981, p. 244 Iribe was a man prone to anger, shouting matches, and fist fights when contradicted and did not endear himself to colleagues. He engaged in a sustained feud with DeMille‚Äôs key costume designer, Mitchell Leisen, which resulted in Leisen being fired by DeMille in 1923. After Iribe‚Äôs costly and infamous failure with Changing Husbands, DeMille was forced to make peace with Leisen and bring him back in. For his film The King of Kings (1927), DeMille assigned Leisen as head designer. Now working with Leisen, Iribe made a serious design error for one of the sets and DeMille let him go. \\"Iribe left Hollywood without any hope of returning there.\\" Back in Paris, a consolation prize awaited Iribe. His wife Maybelle gave him his own design establishment dedicated to the decorative arts located on the fashionable Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor√©.Roux, Edmonde, \\"Chanel and her world,\\" Hachette-Vendome, 1981, p. 244  Le T√©moin   1906-1910  The first incarnation of Iribe‚Äôs journal, Le T√©moin, (‚ÄúThe Witness‚Äù) was published from 1906-1910. It was a compendium of social and political satire with artwork by Iribe and contributions by other well-known illustrators of the day.Charles-Roux, Edmonde, \\"Chanel and her world,\\" Hachette-Vendome, 1981, p. 273 Broadcasting a demonstrable French nationalism, the major illustrations in Le T√©moin were always executed in three colors, the blue, white and red of the French flag. The back cover was invariably an advertisement for French commerce‚Äîboosterism for French made goods and industry.Brandeis University, Brandeis Special Collections Spotlight, The Robert D. Faber University Archives and Special Collections, retrieved, December 5, 2011 Signing his work ‚ÄúJim,‚Äù a caricature drawn by the then unknown Jean Cocteau was published in Le T√©moin In 1910; his likeness of actress Sarah Bernhardt was well received and brought him instant recognition.  1933-1935  Le T√©moin March 4, 1934 The second appearance of Le T√©moin debuted on December 10, 1933, and sixty-nine issues were printed until its demise on June 30, 1935. Iribe‚Äôs illustrations were prolific, rendered in dark monotones of black and white punctuated by vivid red. Unlike its earlier version, this second run of Le T√©moin contained art solely by Iribe himself. It was re-figured into a strident platform for aggressive patriotism, an ultra-nationalist voice fueling an irrational fear of foreigners and preaching anti-Semitism. Jews are invariably presented as the stereotypical aggregate of menacing ‚Äúhook-nosed‚Äù outsiders, holding France at their mercy.Vaugan, Hal, \\"Sleeping With the Enemy, Coco Chanel's Secret War,\\" Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 79-80  Coco Chanel: muse and model  Coco Chanel, (1920), Iribe's lover, muse and patron The drawings, political polemics, featured the identifiable likeness of Iribe‚Äôs lover Coco Chanel re- imagined as the iconic symbol of French liberty, Marianne. One such rendering shows Marianne (Chanel) being subjected to trial and sentence by a court of world leaders, Neville Chamberlain of Great Britain, Adolf Hitler of Germany, Benito Mussolini of Italy, and Franklin Roosevelt of The United States. In a corollary illustration, her prostrate figure is lying at the feet of a gravedigger readying to bury the grandeur of France; the gravedigger is √âdouard Daladier, the Prime Minister of the French Republic. Private life An illustration by Iribe from Les Ateliers de Martine Iribe was part of a Parisian, bohemian clique, a cosmopolitan mix of personalities from the world of the arts and elite society. Notable members were Misia Sert, her husband, Spanish painter, Jos√©-Maria Sert, Jean Cocteau and his lover, French actor, Jean Marais, Serge Lifar, a member of the Diaghilev ballet, and couturier, Coco Chanel. It was a libertine group rife with emotional, and sexual intrigues‚Äîall fueled by drug use and abuse.Vaughan, Hal, \\"Sleeping With the Enemy, Coco Chanel's Secret War,\\" Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 63 The writer Colette harbored an instinctive distrust of Iribe. She wrote: \\"he coos like a dove which makes it all the more interesting, because you will find in old texts that demons assume the voice of Venus.\\" Whenever Iribe approached her in greeting, Colette would demonstrate a mannerism described as a sign of exorcism.Charles-Roux Edmonde, \\"Chanel and her world,\\" Hachette-Vendome, 1981, p. 251 Iribe‚Äôs involvement with Coco Chanel was particularly intense. Chanel found Iribe‚Äôs provocative wit and professional drive matched her own. Theirs was a romantic liaison, and a bond of like souls who shared the same right- wing politics. Chanel financed the publication of Iribe‚Äôs journal, Le T√©moin in the 1930s.Vaughan, Hal, \\"Sleeping With the Enemy, Coco Chanel's Secret War,\\" Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 79  Marriages  In 1911, Iribe married actress and variety entertainer Jeanne Dirys. In a stage production of ‚ÄúLe Cadet des Courtas\\" the same year, she wore a piece of jewelry Iribe had designed in 1910, a luxury turban brooch shaped as an aigrette and inlaid with emerald and pearl. They were divorced in 1918. Iribe's second wife was Maybelle Hogan, an heiress who had previously been married to Francis C Coppicus, a theatrical and musical manager. They had two children, Pablo (born in 1920) and Maybelle (born 1928). They separated in 1928, as a result of Iribe‚Äôs involvement with Coco Chanel. By 1933, friends of Chanel and Iribe were convinced that the two were engaged to be married and that a wedding was imminent.Charles-Roux Edmonde, \\"Chanel and her world,\\" Hachette-Vendome, 1981, p. 275 Death Iribe was with Coco Chanel, at her villa, La Pausa, on the French Riviera, in September 21, 1935, when he suddenly collapsed and died while playing tennis. Chanel witnessed his death, and felt his loss deeply, grieving over him for a protracted period of time.Vaughan, Hal, \\"Sleeping With The Enemy, Coco Chanel's Secret War,\\" Alfred A.

He has lived in Stockholm, Sweden since 2000.  Biography  ≈Ωivkoviƒá was born in Belgrade, where he studied violin at the Music Academy, and then composition at the same school with Vlastimir Trajkoviƒá. He later studied at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm under P√§r Lindgren. His musical style is characterized by fantastic narration, virtuosic instrumentation and stylistic, highly profiled sound. He has developed a variety of compositional techniques such as polyrhythmic improvisation, special harmony-based scales, microtones, layer-polyphony and heterophony. His \\"harmonic field\\" technique was a topic for academic research at the University of Music and Performing Arts in Graz in Austria, Patterns of Intuition - POINT and can be found in several of his works, including \\"Le Cimeti√®re Marin\\" and \\"The White Angel.\\" He has composed a wide range of works including chamber, orchestral and vocal music, music for solo instruments and choral music. ≈Ωivkoviƒá is also a professional violinist and violist, performing new music, as well as an improviser on violin and piano. He has received many international scholarships and prizes for his work, including the most prestigious Grawemeyer Award in 2014.Zivkovic wins Grawemeyer music prize Retrieved 2 December 2013. He has worked as a teacher of composition, music theory and aural training, violin and chamber music, but in recent years has devoted himself solely to writing music. Some of his key works have been composed in the countryside in the middle of Sweden, in Gagnef. ≈Ωivkoviƒá‚Äôs music is regularly commissioned and performed across the world by the leading musicians and orchestras, such as New York Philharmonic, Royal Concertgebouw Amsterdam, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Seattle Symphony Orchestra, Klangforum Wien, Asko|Sch√∂nberg, Ensemble Modern, among others.  Selected works  Le Cimeti√®re Marin (2008) Paul Valery's poem with the same name inspired Zivkovic for the piece commissioned and dedicated to famous mezzo-soprano Anna Larsson and chamber ensemble Sonanza, who gave its premiere. The piece is recorded on the label \\"Phono Suecia,\\" among other pieces by Swedish composers, and has won the Swedish Grammy Award as the best classical CD of year 2009. : The sea is expressed in the first-person voice of the poem; the dead rest under the gravestones. Zivkovic causes time to cease. This takes place through the insistent glissandi, as slow as long waves on the surface of the sea. An improvisational attitude towards his composing gives rise to an ever-changing color spectrum. Erik Wallrup: from the CD booklet. On the Guarding of the Heart (2011) On the Guarding of the Heart was commissioned by and dedicated to Das Klangforum Wien. The premiere was led by British conductor Clement Power. The piece represents Zivkovic's highest achievement in his compositional technique, complexity and musical accessibility. For this work, the composer was awarded the 2014 Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition.http://grawemeyer.org/news-updates/zivkovic-wins-grawemeyer-music- prize : ≈Ωivkoviƒá offers a Utopia of new stability and order that, within the social chaos, can be found only in society‚Äôs ‚Äòantipode‚Äô: the individual. However, the ‚Äòinformation‚Äô about their own depths to which they allegedly descend is conveyed to the individuals through a work of art, a phenomenon whose ontological and phenomenological foundation relies on institutional support and social engagement ‚Äì in other words, it stems from the place it occupies in a society‚Äôs production structure. Also, the knowledge of ‚Äòthe depths of the heart‚Äô comes from a composer who mastered the technique, and is not likely to use all of those fantasies to snap the audience out of their lethargy and confront them with the current problems. On the contrary, by eliminating uncertainty he induces us to ‚Äòdescend‚Äô somewhere where ‚Äòeternity‚Äô overpowers current problems, and that place he calls ‚Äòthe heart‚Äô of ‚Äòthe spiritual.‚Äô ≈Ωivkoviƒá, therefore, as a creator, builds the image of a guardian of tradition who, thanks to his technical skills, transcends national boundaries, proving the ‚Äòpropriety‚Äô and ‚Äòextra-temporality‚Äô of his construction of Serbian heritage, which, if adequately mediated, will demonstrate its value by closeness to universal ‚Äòtruths‚Äô.

Chinilpa was popularized in post-independence Korea for Koreans considered national traitors for collaborating with the Japanese colonial government and fighting against the Korean independence movement. Chinilpa also applies to Koreans that had sought greater alliance or unification with Japan in the last years of Joseon Dynasty, such as Iljinhoe and the Five Eulsa Traitors.As seen in . Prosecution of chinilpa gained increasing support in South Korea after the gradual democratization during the 1980s and 1990s, and the first anti-chinilpa legislation, the Special law to redeem pro-Japanese collaborators' property, was passed in 2005. Today, chinilpa is also associated with general anti-Japanese sentiment in South Korea and is often used as a derogatory term for Japanophilic Koreans. Etymology The term \\"chinilpa\\" (Korean: ÏπúÏùºÌåå) for those who collaborated with the Imperial Japanese rule in Korea first appears in Chinilmunhangnon (Comments on Chinil Literature, ÏπúÏùºÎ¨∏ÌïôÎ°†, 1966), written by Im Jong-Guk, who was an activist of Korea. Before its publication, it was common to call them builbae (Korean: Î∂ÄÏùºÎ∞∞; Hanja: ÈôÑÊó•Ëº©;) which translates literally to \\"people who collaborated with Japan\\", especially criticizing Korean Leadership. \\"<ÏπúÏùºÎ¨∏ÌïôÎ°†> ÏûÑÏ¢ÖÍµ≠ÎãòÏùÑ ÏïÑÏãúÎÇòÏöî?\\", OhmyNews, 2004.01.19. History Prosecution of chinilpa under Syngman Rhee administration The (banmin teugwi, Î∞òÎØºÌäπÏúÑ) Special Committee for Prosecution of Anti-National Offenders was set up in 1948 under the rule of Syngman Rhee to prosecute the chinilpa. It handled 682 cases; 559 cases were handed over to a special prosecutor's office, which handed down indictments in 221 cases. A special tribunal tried 38 cases, sentenced guilty verdicts and punishments in 12 cases including one death sentence. Eighteen others had their civil rights suspended, six others were declared innocent and the remaining two were found guilty but were exempted from punishment. However, the Supreme Court suspended their execution in March 1950, just before the Korean War.\\"Pro-Japan collaborators list sparks controversy\\", The Korea Times, 8/29/2005 Most notably, Syngman Rhee sabotaged and dissolved the banmin teugwi. Under Rhee's regime and in subsequent governments, many of them enjoyed the same wealth and power they had under Japanese rule. Prosecution of chinilpa in the 21st century After more than 50 years have passed since the end of prosecution of chinilpa under the Syngman Rhee administration, the prosecution restarted abruptly as a political agenda of President Roh Moo- hyun. Definition of chinilpa by the Special Law The newly enacted Special Law on the Inspection of Collaborations for the Japanese Imperialism defines \\"pro-Japanese and anti-national actions\\" (chinilpa) as follows. :article 2 :Under this act, the \\"pro-Japanese and anti-national actions\\" means any of the following actions committed between the outbreak of the Russo- Japanese War that began the deprivation of Korean sovereignty by the Japanese imperialism and August 15, 1945. ::1. Any act to attack or order to attack the military forces fighting against the Japanese imperialism to keep sovereign power. ::3. Any act to kill, execute, harass or arrest the persons or their families participating in the independent movement or anti-Japanese movement, and an act to instruct or order those violences thereto. ::6. Any act to agree, join or conspire the treaties that interfered with the sovereign power including Eulsa Treaty, Korean-Japanese Annexation Treaty and others. ::8. Any act of participating in the Assembly of Japanese Empire as a member of the Noble Class or member of Japanese Assembly. ::9. Any act of participating as vice chairman, advisor or House of Representatives for the Senate of the Choson Government-General. ::10.

History The memorandum on deliveries of Russian natural gas to China was signed by Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller and CNPC CEO Chen Geng during Russian president Vladimir Putin's visit to China in March 2006. The project was put on hold due to disagreements over natural gas price and competition from other gas sources in the Chinese market. In 2013, Gazprom and CNPC agreed to instead pursue a more eastern route, the Power of Siberia gas pipeline. In 2014 the projected was resumed during the APEC summit. In 2015 the project was \\"postponed for an indefinite period of time\\". Route The pipeline would start from the Purpeyskaya compressor station of the existing Urengoy‚ÄìSurgut‚ÄìChelyabinsk pipeline. It would carry natural gas from Nadym and Urengoy fields in Western Siberia. Total length of Russian section will be , including in Yamalo-Nenets autonomous region, in Khanty‚ÄìMansi autonomous region, in Tomsk Oblast, in Novosibirsk Oblast, in Altai Krai, and in the Altai Republic. The terminal point in the Russian territory is the Kanas mountain pass. Large part of the pipeline will be built within the technical corridor of existing pipelines, such as the Urengoy‚ÄîSurgut‚ÄîChelyabinsk, Northern Tyumen‚ÄìSurgut‚ÄîOmsk, Nizhnevartovsk gas refinery ‚Äì Parabel, Parabel‚ÄîKuzbass, Novosibirsk‚ÄîKuzbass, Novosibirsk‚ÄîBarnaul, and Barnaul‚ÄîBiysk pipelines. In China, the pipeline would be terminated in the Xinjiang region, where it will be linked to the West‚ÄìEast Gas Pipeline. Alternatively, an eastern route through Mongolia is being studied. Technical description The diameter of the pipeline would be . The designed capacity of the pipeline would be 30 billion cubic meters (bcm) natural gas annually and the total costs of the whole project is expected to be up to US$14 billion. The pipeline was originally expected to become operational in 2011. The pipeline will be built and operated by TomskTransGaz, the subsidiary of Gazprom. Controversy The pipeline project was criticized by environmental organizations, because it was planned to run across the Ukok Plateau, which is the natural habitat of the snow leopard and other endangered species. Besides, Altai national leaders fear that laying the pipeline and accompanying technical highway will pave way for a Chinese expansion into Altai. The pipeline route impacts burial sites and shrines in the region.

It refers to a group of flamenco musical forms or palos with diverse musical features, which \\"travelled back\\" from Latin America (mainly Cuba) as styles that, having originated in the interplay between Spanish musical traditions and those of the African slaves and Native Americans, developed into renewed forms that were reintroduced in Spain. Usually they have a more mellow character than the more traditional flamenco songs.  History  In the Spanish Golden Age, dramatists like Lope de Vega and Tirso de Molina already included songs and dances of Latin American influence.BLAS VEGA, Jos√©: Magna Antolog√≠a del Cante, Introduction booklet, Hispavox, CD Edition 1992 (First Edition 1982) There is also evidence of their popularity in the 19th century: many examples still remain of printed songbooks and sheets, often mixing Andalusian and Latin American songs, which were sold in the streets, and Baron Charles Davillier, in his trip in Spain in 1862 described a fiesta (party) in these terms: > [‚Ä¶] and a young Gypsy [‚Ä¶] danced the American tango with an extraordinary > grace. Another widely known music in Andalusia is the Punto de la Habana, > whose name indicates its origin, and it is used to accompany the d√©cimas > sung between dances in parties.Quoted in BLAS VEGA, Jos√©: Magna Antolog√≠a > del Cante, Introduction booklet, Hispavox, CD Edition 1992 (First Edition > 1982) The exchange of musical influences was particularly important at the end of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, when the United States gained control over Cuba, the last Spanish territory in Latin America. The defeat involved the return of many Spanish emigrants to Spain. These returned migrants, popularly called indianos, also brought back their songs and their music, which were soon included in the repertoire of flamenco artists, after a process of adaptation to the flamenco style of singing and playing. Although Antonio Chac√≥n already sang these styles (he recorded the milonga in 1913), the first flamenco singer who recorded a significant repertoire of guajiras, milongas, and vidalitas was Manuel Escacena. He made popular the milonga \\"Juan Sim√≥n\\", which he learnt from Mexican bullfighters around 1911, and which was later recorded by several other singers.  Palos classified as cantes de ida y vuelta  The palos included in this category have different musical characteristics, so the category of ida y vuelta is just a common denomination based on their origin. The palos normally included in this category are the following: * Guajiras. Sometimes called also punto cubano. Probably it was the first song of the ida y vuelta type to be incorporated into flamenco, in the second half of the 19th century, but its golden age, as with most of the songs of this group, was the period known as √≥pera flamenca (1922‚Äì1956).ALVAREZ CABALLERO, √Ångel: La discograf√≠a ideal del flamenco, Planeta, Barcelona, 1995 The lyrics are composed in stanzas called d√©cimas, consisting of 10 octosyllabic lines rhyming ABBAACCDDC. It has a 12-beat rhythmic pattern like the Peteneras, that is, a combination of 6/8 and 3/4 metres, ([1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]). * Colombianas. This style was created by singer Pepe Marchena in 1931 and soon became very popular. Most singers of the √≥pera flamenca time recorded it. While their melody resembles the Guajiras, their rhythm is 4/4. The stanza has six octosyllabic verses. * Milonga. It is based on Argentinian folklore, with 4/4 time signature and stanzas in four octosyllabic lines. Singer Pepa Oro learnt it while travelling in America and adapted it to flamenco style, making it popular in Spain. * Vidalita. Originated in the folklore of northern Argentina. Its stanza is made of four octosyllabic lines. It is perhaps the less frequently recorded style in this group. The best remembered recordings from the √≥pera flamenca period are those by Pepe Marchena and Juan Valderrama, but after that period, with the deprecation of non-Gypsy styles by the singers of the generation of Antonio Mairena, it was practically forgotten. Recently, after Mayte Mart√≠n's recording of Valderrama's version, it enjoyed new popularity and it has even been recorded by Gypsy singer Diego El Cigala. * Rumbas. This style of Afro- Cuban origin has a lively 4/4 rhythm still very reminiscent of its Cuban origin. The style had been more or less marginal in the flamenco artists' repertoires, although it was recorded by some singers like La Ni√±a de los Peines or Manuel Vallejo, among others. However, it reached enormous popularity after the decades of the 60s and 70s, when it was adopted by Catalan gypsies like Antonio Gonz√°lez El Pesca√≠lla and Peret. Since then, it has become the regular \\"hit track\\" in the recordings of many singers and guitarists, including specialists like Bambino or Maruja Garrido, Gypsy groups like Los Chunguitos, Los Amaya, and practically all modern flamenco guitarists like Paco de Luc√≠a, Tomatito or Vicente Amigo. It is rarely sung by more traditional flamenco singers (with great exceptions like Chano Lobato, an excellent performer of all rhythmic styles), and flamencologists have tended to regard this genre as \\"not flamenco\\". The melodies of guajiras, colombianas and milongas have also frequently been adapted to the rhythms of other palos like buler√≠as or tangos. Other styles of possible Latin American influence Although not normally classified under the category of the cantes de ida y vuelta, some critics consider flamenco tangos to be of Afro-Cuban origin. However, the question of the origins of tangos is much debated.MART√çN SALAZAR, Jorge: Los cantes flamencos, Diputaci√≥n de Granada, 1991 Molina and Mairena considered it a basic flamenco song and therefore Gypsy. Guitarist Manuel Cano found Indian, Arabian and American influences in it. Tanguillos, a lively palo in 6/8 rhythm, usually with humorous lyrics, are sometimes also related with Latin American Origin. Again, their origin is rather controversial, and they are rarely the subject of study of flamencologists. However, the rhythms of tanguillos and, especially, tangos, (or very similar ones) can be found in many parts of the world.

Biography Skrefsrud came from the parish of F√•berg situated north of Lillehammer in Oppland, Norway. As a young man he was imprisoned for three years, and during his incarceration started to both read the Bible and study languages. Upon his release, he studied at the missionary school of Johannes Evangelista Go√üner in Berlin, where he was prepared for his mission. In 1863, he left for India. Together with Hans Peter B√∏rresen he is regarded as the founder of the Norwegian Santal Mission (Den norske Santalmisjon) (from 2001 a part of Normisjon). Skrefsrud learned the language of the Hindi, Bengali and Sanskrit. He published a songbook in the Santali language with Christian texts for local melodies and later a grammar for the Santal people. In 1881‚Äì83, he traveled to Denmark and Norway to gain support for the mission. In 1882, he was ordained by Bishop Carl Peter Parelius Essendrop in Kristiania (now Oslo). Skrefsrud died during 1910 in the village of Benagaria in Jharkhand, India. He was followed at the mission by the missionary, linguist and folklorist Paul Olaf Bodding. The mission he established in India has grown to a church with over 150,000 members in the Indian states of Jharkhand, Bihar, West Bengal and Assam. In the 1950s it became an independent institution - The Northern Evangelical Lutheran Church (NELC).

The antibody reaction allows these species to be visualized under a microscope. If the reaction is positive, the capsule becomes opaque and appears to enlarge. Photomicrograph of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria revealing capsular swelling using the Neufeld quellung test. Notice the two streptococci at the top of the photo that appear to have no capsule. Quellung is the German word for \\"swelling\\" and describes the microscopic appearance of pneumococcal or other bacterial capsules after their polysaccharide antigen has combined with a specific antibody. The antibody usually comes from a bit of serum taken from an immunized laboratory animal. As a result of this combination, and precipitation of the large, complex molecule formed, the capsule appears to swell, because of increased surface tension, and its outlines become clearly demarcated. The pneumococcal quellung reaction was first described in 1902 by the scientist Fred Neufeld, and applied only to Streptococcus pneumoniae, both as microscopic capsular swelling and macroscopic agglutination (clumping visible with the naked eye). It was initially an intellectual curiosity more than anything else, and could distinguish only the three pneumococcal serotypes known at that time. However, it acquired an important practical use with the advent of serum therapy to treat certain types of pneumococcal pneumonia in the 1920s because selection of the proper antiserum to treat an individual patient required correct identification of the infecting pneumococcal serotype, and the quellung reaction was the only method available to do this. Dr. Albert Sabin made modifications to Neufeld's technique so that it could be done more rapidly, and other scientists expanded the technique to identify 29 additional serotypes. Application of Neufeld‚Äôs discoveries to other important areas of research came when Fred Griffith showed that pneumococci could transfer information to transform one serotype into another. Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty later showed that the transforming factor was deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. Serum therapy for infectious diseases was displaced by antibiotics in the 1940s, but identification of specific serotypes remained important as the understanding of the epidemiology of pneumococcal infections still required their identification to determine where different serotypes spread, as well as the variable invasiveness of different serotypes. Understanding the prevalence of various serotypes was also critical to the development of pneumococcal vaccines to prevent invasive infections. The quellung reaction has been used to identify the 93 known capsular serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae in diagnostic settings, but in recent years it has been challenged by the latex agglutination method, and further by molecular typing techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction, which detect DNA and therefore target genetic differences between serotypes.PCR Deduction of Pneumococcal Serotypes .

To differentiate between Rickets and Blount's disease it is important to correlate the clinical picture with laboratory findings such as calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase. Besides the X-ray appearance. Bone deformities in Rickets have a reasonable likelihood to correct over time, while this is not the case with Blount's disease. Nevertheless both disorders may need surgical intervention in the form of bone osteotomy or more commonly guided growth surgery. Osteochondrodysplasias or genetic bone diseases can cause lower extremity deformities similar to Blount's disease. The clinical appearance and the characteristic radiographic are important to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment Children who develop severe bowing before the age of 3 may be treated with knee ankle foot orthoses. However, bracing may fail, or bowing may not be detected until the child is older.

She has a tail of spun-glass. In personality, Bungle is almost stereotypically catlike--cool and reserved and aloof as well as vain. The cat \\"is so determined not to show emotion that when implored to bring help she sets off very slowly and runs only when out of sight.\\"John Clute and John Grant, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, New York, Macmillan, 1999; p. 174.Martin Gardner and Russel B. Nye make the same point, in: The Wizard of Oz and Who He Was, East Lansing, MI, Michigan State University Press, 1957; p. 34. Baum was unusual in creating a character that is transparent but visible. (Baum magically animates a spun-glass animal in an earlier story, though the dog is not transparent but pink, with a blue ribbon around its neck and shiny black glass eyes.)L. Frank Baum, \\"The Glass Dog,\\" in: American Fairy Tales, Chicago, George M. Hill, 1901. Through its incessant prowling throughout the Land of Oz, however, the Glass Cat has acquired intimate knowledge of its complex terrain; and it is generally willing to exploit this knowledge to the benefit of Dorothy and her friends. In The Magic of Oz, for example, the Glass Cat guides the rescue party that saves Trot and Cap'n Bill from entrapment on the Magic Isle. And the Cat is virtually invulnerable to harm, which is a great advantage in its various adventures. It was quickly reasoned that it was Bungle's pink brains that had made her so conceited, and the Wizard of Oz eventually replaced them with clear ones to make her more agreeable. After her adventures with Ojo the Lucky and the Patchwork Girl, the Cat ended up being a pet of Princess Ozma in the Emerald City.

The National Map , accessed April 1, 2011 tributary of the Schuylkill River in Berks County, Pennsylvania in the United States.Gertler, Edward. Keystone Canoeing, Seneca Press, 2004. The name \\"Maiden\\" is an English translation of the Native American word Ontelaunee. Maiden Creek is formed by the confluence of Ontelaunee and Kistler creeks in the community of Kempton. The tributary Sacony Creek joins at the community of Virginville. The creek was dammed in 1926 to form Lake Ontelaunee. The creek joins the Schuylkill River north of the city of Reading, for which it serves as the main drinking water supply. Buildings and structures * The Merkel Mill is located on Maiden Creek in Greenwich Township, Pennsylvania Note: This includes * The Bridge in Albany Township crosses Maiden Creek at Trexler * A railroad bridge crosses Maiden Creek just before it empties into the Schuylkill River The railroad bridge next to the Schuylkill Watershed The Maiden Creek watershed covers approximately with more than of perennial streams, including Maiden/Ontelaunee Creek and ten named tributaries (Kistler Creek, Stony Run, Pine Creek, Furnace Creek, Mill Creek, Sacony Creek, Peters Creek, Baileys Creek, Willow Creek, Moselem Springs). The watershed is in the southeast portion of Pennsylvania, lying within the upper Schuylkill River Basin in northeastern Berks County and extreme western Lehigh County. Small portions of eastern Schuylkill County lie within the watershed at the ridgeline of Blue Mountain and in State Gamelands. Nineteen townships and five boroughs, or parts thereof, lie within the watershed. The boroughs of Kutztown, Fleetwood, Lenhartsville and Lyons, along with Greenwich, Maidencreek and Richmond townships lie entirely within the watershed. Nearly all of Albany, Lynn, Maxatawny and Windsor townships are within the watershed as well. There are five protected use designations awarded to streams that support the maintenance and propagation of fish species and suitable habitat for flora and fauna. The two highest designations, High Quality (HQ) and Exceptional Value (EV) mandate special water quality protection, as they embody outstanding ecological resources that are required to be maintained at existing quality. The Maiden Creek and its tributaries have achieved high rankings for water quality. Peters Creek and the source waters of Saucony Creek are classified Exceptional Value (EV), the highest designation, reserved for the most pristine waters in the state. The upper portion of Pine Creek and Bailey Creek are listed as High Quality ‚Äì Cold Water Fisheries (HQ-CWF). Ontelaunee Creek and the lower section of Pine Creek are rated Cold Water Fisheries (CWF), which support trout and native flora and fauna in a cold- water habitat. Upper Maiden Creek and a majority of its tributaries are rated Trout Stocked Fishery (TSF), supporting the maintenance of stocked trout from February 15 to July 31. Lower Maiden Creek and Lake Ontelaunee support the propagation of fish species, flora and fauna that are indigenous to a Warm Waters Fishery. The Appalachian Trail, running from Maine to Georgia, parallels the northern border of the watershed in Albany, Greenwich, and Windsor townships. This is a nationally significant recreational resource that attracts thousands of users each year. The trail follows the crest of Blue Mountain from the north and dips down into both the Pine and Furnace Creek subbasins before exiting the watershed to the west. Several side trails provide access to Hawk Mountain Sanctuary, Blue Rocks and the Pinnacle, three regionally important recreational features. The Federal Highland Conservation area is another nationally significant area stretching from Connecticut through Pennsylvania providing a green buffer for the metropolis areas of Hartford, New York City and Philadelphia. Saucony Creek originates from the Oley Hills portion of the Pennsylvania section of the Highlands. Saucony Creek is in length with a section of the stream having been designated as Exceptional Value by the PA DEP. Saucony Creek is the drinking water source for the Borough of Kutztown and a tributary to the City of Reading's drinking water supply. Saucony Creek and Saucony Marsh are listed as high priority sites for protection in the Berks County Open Space & Recreation Plan, the Maiden Creek Watershed Conservation Plan, the Kutztown/Lyons/Maxatawny draft Joint Comprehensive Plan, the Kutztown Comprehensive, Recreation & Parks Plan and the Berks County Comprehensive Plan.

He has strongly criticized the traditions of positivism, realism, and relativism, and he has defended a view of science as a privileged and progressive institution against popular challenges. Laudan's philosophical view of \\"research traditions\\" is seen as an important alternative to Imre Lakatos's \\"research programs.\\"Peter Godfrey- Smith, Theory and Reality, 2003, University of Chicago, , pp.102-121. Life and career Laudan took his PhD in Philosophy at Princeton University, and then taught at University College London and, for many years, at the University of Pittsburgh. Subsequently, he taught at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University, University of Hawaii and the National Autonomous University of Mexico. He presently teaches at the University of Texas, Austin. His more recent work has been on legal epistemology. He is the husband of food historian Rachel Laudan. Philosophical work Laudan's most influential book is Progress and Its Problems (1977), in which he charges philosophers of science with paying lip service to the view that \\"science is fundamentally a problem-solving activity\\" without taking seriously the view's implications for the history of science and its philosophy, and without questioning certain issues in the historiography and methodology of science. Against empiricism, which is represented by Karl Popper, and \\"revolutionism,\\" represented by Thomas Kuhn, Laudan maintained in Progress and Its Problems that science is an evolving process that accumulates more empirically validated evidence while solving conceptual anomalies at the same time. Mere evidence collecting or empirical confirmation does not constitute the true mechanism of scientific advancement; conceptual resolution and comparison of the solutions of anomalies provided by various theories form an indispensable part of the evolution of science. Laudan is particularly well known for his pessimistic induction argument against the claim that the cumulative success of science shows that science must truly describe reality. Laudan famously argued in his 1981 article \\"A Confutation of Convergent Realism\\"https://courses.cs.sfu.ca/2015fa-phil-880-g1/pages/laudan/view that \\"the history of science furnishes vast evidence of empirically successful theories that were later rejected; from subsequent perspectives, their unobservable terms were judged not to refer and thus, they cannot be regarded as true or even approximately true.\\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/#PesInd In Beyond Positivism and Relativism, Laudan wrote that \\"the aim of science is to secure theories with a high problem-solving effectiveness\\" and that scientific progress is possible when empirical data is diminished. \\"Indeed, on this model, it is possible that a change from an empirically well-supported theory to a less well-supported one could be progressive, provided that the latter resolved significant conceptual difficulties confronting the former.\\"Laudan, Beyond Positivism and Relativism, Boulder, CO, Westview Press, 1996, pp.77-87. Finally, the better theory solves more conceptual problems while minimizing empirical anomalies. Laudan has also written on risk management and the subject of terrorism. He has argued that \\"moral outrage and compassion are the proper responses to terrorism, but fear for oneself and one's life is not. The risk that the average American will be a victim of terrorism is extremely remote.\\"Laudan, \\"Should We Be Afraid?\\", in The Challenge of Terrorism: A Historical Reader.

J. MacDermot (25 November 1886 ‚Äì 24 June 1975) was an Irish barrister, soldier and a prominent politician in the 1930s and 40s. Biography MacDermot was born in Dublin, the seventh and youngest son of Hugh Hyacinth O'Rorke MacDermot, Prince of Coolavin. He was educated at Downside School and the University of Oxford and qualified as a barrister. He was commissioned into the Royal Army Service Corps during World War I and ended the war as a Major. He later emigrated to the United States and became a banker in New York City from 1919 until 1927. He returned to Ireland in the late 1920s, and stood unsuccessfully as an Independent Republican candidate for Belfast West at the 1929 United Kingdom general election. An anglophile, he was elected to D√°il √âireann at the 1932 Irish general election as an independent Teachta D√°la (TD) for Roscommon. In 1933, anticipating another election that year, He founded the National Centre Party alongside James Dillon, and became the party's leader. The party was short-lived; MacDermot led the National Centre Party to merge with Cumann na nGaedheal and the Blueshirts to form Fine Gael that same year, and became a Vice-President of the new party. It was reputedly MacDermot who devised the name of the party. He was a persistent critic of Fianna F√°il and √âamon de Valera. He criticised the abolition of the oath of allegiance, the abolition of the Free State Seanad √âireann, the abolition of the Governor-General and the introduction of the Constitution of Ireland in 1937, arguing each time that these actions would make partition more secure, and arguing the need for rapprochement with the government of Northern Ireland and the wider unionist community. He continually stated that partition could only be addressed when Dublin-London relationships were normalised. MacDermot had led the National Centre Party into Fine Gael on the pretence that members of the Irish Republican Army were breaking up meetings of Cumann na nGaedheal and other right-wing parties in support of the Republican Fianna F√°il, and that in order to survive the National Centre Party would have to band together with both Cumann na nGaedheal and Eoin O'Duffy's Blueshirts. However, with the accession of Fianna F√°il to power and tough anti-IRA measure put in place by de Valera, the marriage of convivence rapidly became undone. O'Duffy had become the initial leader of the party but by the summer of 1934 he had become an embarrassment to the other leaders and members of the party when he openly questioned the value of democracy after Fine Gael came second to Fianna F√°il in the 1934 Irish local elections. MacDermot and other constitutionalists in the party rebuked O'Duffy's comments. By September of 1934, O'Duffy had resigned as leader and left the party. O'Duffy's departure did not increase MacDermot's comfort with the big tent of Fine Gael; he resigned from the party in 1935 when members of Fine Gael criticised de Valera for condemning the invasion of Ethiopia by fascist Italy at a meeting of the League of Nations. In 1937, de Valera moved to introduce a new constitution of Ireland, and MacDermot was especially active in the debates over its contents. He objected to the recognition of Irish as the first official language of the state and to the suggestion that the Roman Catholic Church should be given a ‚Äòspecial position‚Äô in the constitution. He supported direct elections to the Seanad and argued that citizens of Northern Ireland should be allowed to participate in the referendum on the constitution. He also argued that D√°il constituency should be at least five seats. He did not seek re-election in 1938, and, surprisingly, joined Fianna F√°il that same year. In return, de Valera appointed him to re-established Seanad, where he would remain until 1943. He had had personal differences with his Fine Gael colleagues on issues such as the degree of emphasis to be given to Ireland's membership of the Commonwealth. During World War II he was a critic of Irish neutrality throughout his tenure as a Senator, arguing that Ireland should be fighting with the Allies. He subsequently became the U.S. and Paris correspondent for The Irish Times newspaper. Personal Life While working in America, MacDermot met the American Elaine Orr Thayer, then the wife of the poet E. E. Cummings, her second marriage. Orr Thaye left Cummings for MacDermot, and at one point, Cummings considered killing MacDermot in revenge. Cummings and Elaine divorced, and subsequently, Frank and Elaine married before engaging Cummings in a protracted custody battle over Elaine's young daughter Nancy. Together Elaine and Frank had one son, Brian MacDermot. Orr Thaye died in 1974. MacDermot died in 1975 while on a visit to London.

Opening at the Gaiety Theatre, London on 24 December 1887, the production was a flop, closing after a week. It starred Nellie Farren as Dr. Frankenstein and Fred Leslie as a monster who is in touch with his feminine side. The Victorian audiences found the piece too feminist in tone.

Disocactus flagelliformis), the rattail cactus, is a species of flowering plant in the cactus family Cactaceae, and is the most cultivated species in the genus Aporocactus. Due to its ease of cultivation and attractive floral displays, it is often grown as an ornamental potted plant. Description Stems ascending, later prostrate or pendent, profusely branching at base, 1‚Äì2 m long or more, 8‚Äì24 mm thick; ribs 7-14, obtuse; margins ¬± tuberculate; areoles minute, whitish; internodes 4‚Äì8 mm; spines 8-20, 3-8 (-10) mm long, bristle-like, yellowish to brownish; epidermis green, later grayish. Flowers zygomorphic, 7‚Äì10 cm long, 2-4 (-7,5) cm wide, limb bilaterally symmetric, oblique, diurnal, open for 3‚Äì5 days, scentless; pericarpel greenish with acute bracteoles; receptacle 3 cm, long, curved just above pericarpel, bracteoles, brownish, acute; outer tepals linear-lanceolate, ¬± reflexed, 2‚Äì3 cm long, 6 mm wide, crimson; inner tepals narrowly oblong, to 10 mm wide, crimson, sometimes passing to pink along the margins; stamens white to pale pink, erect, exserted; style stigma lobes 5-7, white Fruit globose, 10‚Äì12 mm long, red, bristly, pulp yellowish; seeds ovoid, brownish red.  Taxonomy  Aporocactus used to be a subgenus in Disocactus, but according to molecular evidence, it should be excluded from Disocactus and form a genus on its own. Therefore, the correct scientific name of this species is Aporocactus flagelliformis. Etymology The Latin specific epithet flagelliformis means \\"shaped like a whip\\", in reference to the long shoots. The common name \\"rattail\\" refers to the same feature. History One of the first cacti to be introduced into European culture. Watson (1898) offers the year 1690 but probably earlier. This has always been one of the most popular cacti in cultivation. Still almost nothing is known about its natural habit. Origin and habitat Mexico: Hidalgo. Dry forests. Lithophytic or epiphytic in dry forests. Seems rare and seldom collected in the field. Cultivation Rattail cacti are very easy to grow, being suitable for a greenhouse and container, indoors or out. These plants need a minimum temperature of 6 ¬∞C (43 ¬∞F). They should be grown in bright, indirect light, in a fairly rich potting mix. The best compost consists of four parts sandy loam, and one part of equal quantities of sand and crushed brick. They should be repotted every other year because their soil tends to sour. This does not mean, however, that they will need larger pots. Once the plants are established, the compost should be kept moist from April to October; less water is required from November until March, just enough to keep the stems from dying back. In the winter, old or discolored stems may be cut out at the base to encourage new growth. This plant is a recipient of the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

Calvert's work appears to have been exclusively confined to Edinburgh, and was mostly concerned with the creation of Baronial tenements (particularly in Marchmont) and villas in the Second Empire and Jacobean styles. He is responsible for a varied selection of villas on or in the vicinity of Colinton Road in Merchiston; one of these was for many years the home of author Dorothy Dunnett. He is also known to have designed modifications for at least one New Town building, in Abercromby Place, in 1899. Life Calvert was born in Brentford, Middlesex in March 1847, the son of William Calvert, a corn and coal merchant and his wife Esther Roberts. He trained as an architect under Frederick Thomas Pilkington. His work appears to be exclusively limited to domestic architecture in Edinburgh and was largely also done in partnership with the builder Peter Craig Renton.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Calvert Much of his work (especially in Marchmont) shows strong stylistic influence from Sir James Gowans.

Henri (Bacri) runs a saloon that he inherited from his father called \\"The Sleepy Dad,\\" and in the near-empty bar, he plays host to several members of the family as they mark the 35th birthday of his sister-in-law, Yolande (Frot). Henri's sister, Betty (Jaoui), is 30, single, and not very happy about it; his brother (and Yolande's husband), Philippe (Yordanoff), is an executive in a growing software company; Mother (Maurier) is the siblings' strong-willed matriarch; and Henri's paralyzed dog is on hand, whom someone describes as \\"like a rug, but alive.\\" It's not been a good day for most of them: Philippe is anxious that his boss might not have liked the tie he wore on television; Betty is depressed about the sad state of her current relationship; Henri has just learned that his wife is leaving him; and Mother is tossing caustic barbs at everyone left and right. Henri's bartender Denis (Darroussin) is the one neutral party on hand, and he provides the voice of reason in the midst of the bickering.
